And the NFL our biggest and most popular sports league. But while the NFL\u2019s status as the king of America\u2019s sports hill remains, I don\u2019t remember its position ever being as precarious. To wit, each of the biggest NFL-related stories of the year has been extremely unflattering to the league.\n\nThere\u2019s all of the Colin Kaepernick-related stories (the protests, the reactions from the fans and the front offices and the freakin president to the protests, the boycotts, and the possible collusion to blackball him). And, then, the action on the field has been overshadowed by the conversations about what the action on the field is doing to the brains and bodies of the players.\n\nThe NFL\u2019s ratings have reflected this, falling 9.7 percent this year after falling 8 percent last year\u2014a dip that was then attributed to the election. This decline has led to a $300 million drop in ad revenue. Which, for a multibillion-dollar behemoth, isn\u2019t the end of the world. I doubt anyone in the league\u2019s front office is panicking. But I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the whiskeys they order at their pre-Super Bowl meetings and parties this weekend were doubles.\n\nNaturally, there are myriad possible reasons for this decline in viewership. Most notable is the fact that there are just too many things to watch and too many ways to consume media. People are just doing other things.\n\nIt is interesting, though, that a week before the Super Bowl\u2014the biggest sports and television event of the year\u2014the stories dominating the national sports conversation have nothing to do with the NFL. Instead, we\u2019re discussing, debating and arguing about a draft. A draft for the NBA All-Star Game. A draft that wasn\u2019t even televised. A motherfucking conference call. A Skype conversation between LeBron James and Steph Curry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, I\u2019m sure by this time next week (as the actual game nears), the NFL will be back at the center of our public and cultural consciousness. Especially as the country puts our collective psychic powers together to band against Tom Brady and his merry crew of\u201cMAGA\u201d Patriots.\n\nAnd like every other year, there will be Super Bowl parties, where many people will be only tangentially interested in the actual game.

We\u2019ll try to avoid any spoilers.\n\nBAMorg via YouTube\n\nThe Dora Milaje\u2014Wakandan for \u201cadored ones\u201d\u2014first appeared in 1998, created by Christopher Priest during his tenure as writer of Black Panther. Originally based on supermodels Naomi Campbell and Tyra Banks, the Dora were initially conceived not only as female warriors but also as potential wives for the king, whom they\u2019ve pledged to protect, along with the royal family. They were the best and strongest women from the 18 villages within Wakanda and trained at the royal palace.\n\nBut while Priest may in part cite supermodels as his inspiration, there is a historical prototype for the Dora Milaje in the Dahomey \u201cAmazons\u201d\u2014so nicknamed by European colonizers and now known by the French-speaking Beninese as the \u201cN\u2019Nonmiton\u201d (which translates to \u201cour mothers\u201d in Fon).\n\nCreated in the late 17th century by King Wegbaja of the West African nation of Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) as a group of female hunters known as gbeto, and later expanded by his son King Agaja, the N\u2019Nonmiton were an all-female guard and fighting force. Like the Dora Milaje, the N\u2019Nonmiton were also considered wives of the king, pledging celibacy as well as loyalty and protection to him. And they existed in this role until the colonization of Dahomey in the late 19th century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can learn all about the incredible female warriors of Dahomey in a 2015 episode of the podcast Stuff You Missed in History Class, and in a very comprehensive comic on their history created by UNESCO for its Series on Women in African History (pdf).

I still don\u2019t think I\u2019ve fully processed or fully understand what impact this movie is going to have on people\u2019s lives. So I\u2019m excited.\u201d \u2014Douriean\n\nJewelry designer and metalsmith Douriean Fletcher\u2014who designs and retails simply as Douriean\u2014is having the kind of breakthrough moment most artists can\u2019t even begin to dream of. Handpicked by friend and legendary costume designer Ruth E. Carter to join the costume team of Black Panther (the two previously worked together on 2016\u2019s Roots), Douriean\u2019s handcrafted jewelry and metalwork adorn the citizens and royalty of Wakanda\u2014perhaps most dazzlingly as the armor and neckpieces of the incredible warrior women of the Dora Milaje.\n\nWatching her own work in action was a thrilling experience, as Douriean told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nSeeing the movie, it was an absolute joy to see this glistening armor just pop off the screen. ... These Dora characters are the first defense of Wakanda; they\u2019re the ones that defend the honor and the safety of the country. So I think I didn\u2019t really fully process what that meant\u2014that I was creating those pieces\u2014until I saw the movie the other day. The actual craftsmanship of those pieces was a very interesting yet challenging experience ... these pieces have a meaning. They have a specific meaning of who these women are, and what they do for their country. They\u2019re there to be resilient and strong, and to protect Wakanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m inspired and intrigued by how we choose to represent ourselves as resilient and beautiful and functional, regardless of what we\u2019ve experienced in life.\u201d\n\nDouriean\u2019s handmade, often hand-hammered aesthetic was a perfect match for this newest cinematic corner of the Marvel Universe, which introduces us to the technologically advanced, culturally rich fictional African nation of Wakanda. Douriean, who considers her work not only Afrofuturistic but \u201cAncient Futuristic\u201d or \u201cPrimal Chic,\u201d welcomed the challenge to translate her artistic aesthetic to the big screen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDouriean explained:\n\nI feel like I have a lot of responsibility, first off, to communicate a certain message through my work. I feel like it\u2019s a lot of responsibility, but I think it\u2019s a great position to be in. ... But I think as far as the Marvel Universe, it\u2019s a perfect match because I was able to bring something different to this culture of Wakanda, this fictional country that they had yet to really tap into.\n\nCostume designer Carter agreed, telling The Glow Up that she\u2019d specifically chosen Douriean because she felt strongly that the metal pieces used in Black Panther had to have a \u201chand-tooled African, hand-hammered\u201d aesthetic. That, coupled with director Ryan Coogler\u2019s desire for even the armor to look like beautiful African jewelry, made Douriean the ideal choice. The jewelry designer confessed to us that initially, she held back in deference to the Marvel aesthetic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[Ruth E. Carter] said, \u2018This isn\u2019t Douriean enough. You have to put more of yourself in it.\u2019 That was exciting. Like, oh, wait, you\u2019re giving me some space to do my thing,\u201d Douriean said.\n\nA Pasadena, Calif., native, Douriean has been creating jewelry since 2010. She is mostly self-taught, save for a three-month metalsmithing class in New Orleans. Having traveled throughout Tanzania and South Africa and now based in Los Angeles, she makes work that \u201cexplores cultural identity, femininity, spirituality and divine power.\u201d When asked where she gleans her inspiration, she told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nSometimes it\u2019s my story; if I experience something that\u2019s quite challenging, I\u2019ll take inspiration from that\u2014and, sometimes, motivation from those experiences\u2014and put that into a piece. Sometimes I literally just have dreams, and I wake up in the middle of night and sketch them out. And sometimes other people\u2019s stories, or just their essence ... women, we\u2019re very multifaceted creatures. So I\u2019m inspired and intrigued by how we choose to represent ourselves as resilient and beautiful and functional, regardless of what we\u2019ve experienced in life. ... The physique of a woman is very beautiful, and I want\u2014whenever I create something\u2014to be able to adorn someone to where they feel regal and beautiful and powerful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a female metalsmith, Douriean admitted that her eight-year journey has been a challenge, as there aren\u2019t many women in the field, let alone black women. But she credits the obstacles with her growth as an artist and innovator:\n\n\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve been underestimated at times; people are just surprised that I can create what I do, or doubt that I can create what I make. And because it\u2019s so different from what people think when they think of jewelry-making, it\u2019s been a challenge to find my niche and my clientele. Like this whole entire process, like this is the first time\u2014these past two years\u2014where I feel like I\u2019ve finally found my tribe and my clientele of people who can understand and accept my work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith that growth and increasing exposure have come major shifts for Douriean, especially as the officially licensed jewelry designer for both Black Panther and the upcoming Avengers film, which promises to be an even larger production. While creating for mass market raises her exposure and reach, it definitely presented challenges to her typically one-of-a-kind approach to design. According to Douriean:\n\nAs an artist, I like to create one-offs\u2014I like to create one thing, it has a story to it, it means something and it\u2019s for one particular person. To be able to have to expand that, and create a narrative for a group of people, it\u2019s a different way of approaching my work. So, for instance, the Black Panther line ... I created that, number one, for the comic book fan; the young men and women or the young boys and girls who grew up on the comics, who are super excited, who have been waiting for this moment for years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those of us coveting a piece of Black Panther to take home, the sterling silver Black Panther collection is currently available on Douriean\u2019s website. A collection inspired by Panther villain Killmonger is next, and lastly, a collection inspired by the Dora Milaje, which Douriean will handcraft herself.\n\nThe Glow Up caught a preview of both Lupita Nyong\u2019o and the designer herself at the Marvel Studios Black Panther Welcome to Wakanda New York Fashion Week presentation on Monday. Frankly, we can\u2019t wait to see if 24-karat-gold neck rings and epaulets are in our futures. The designer was coy:\n\n\u201cI wanted the Dora pieces to be very special, so I\u2019m handcrafting all of those. So it\u2019s coming. It\u2019s coming,\u201d she told us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut right now, Douriean is just savoring the moment and trying to process how it feels to become part of cinematic history:", "keywords": ["metal", "black", "adorned", "feel", "create", "panther", "douriean", "think", "heavy", "jewelry", "designer", "armored", "women", "work", "jeweler"], "polarity": 0.2566777954749653, "subjectivity": 0.5426845952789348},

In the past four years, the third-generation hairstylist has been making her mark on Marvel films, leading the hair departments of the last two Captain America films, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and, now, Black Panther.\n\nOf course, the Black Panther is a unique superhero, and Black Panther is already proving to be an exceptionally unique film, as Friend tells The Glow Up:\n\nI think Black Panther is\u2014I call it a stand-alone Marvel movie, even though Marvel still has a formula. But I feel like it\u2019s a stand-alone movie, especially for me, because I\u2019m a black woman, and [to do] the first black superhero, that was really an honor, in the sense [that] we\u2019re presenting all of this to the world. We had an important job to do, and I looked at it in a whole different way, because it represents my people. So I felt like, the weight of the world on me at some points, but in the greatest way\u2014that I had the opportunity to present us in the best possible light and put something on camera that\u2019s never been [seen]. So it\u2019s a great responsibility and it\u2019s a great challenge, but it\u2019s my greatest joy in doing it, also.\n\nRepresenting her people was paramount in Friend\u2019s mind as she approached the task of helping to bring Black Panther to life. To begin, she divided the film into three elements: traditional Africa, contemporary Africa and the futuristic Africa represented by the technologically advanced civilization that is Wakanda. In her research, she drew inspiration from everything from traditional African tribes like the Maasai and Zulu to the groundbreaking fashion statements we\u2019ve seen at Afropunk celebrations around the globe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really taking and looking at traditional styles, traditional tribal looks, and seeing what we can make into a modern style,\u201d Friend says. \u201cI like to take, like, a period hairstyle and put it in a modern movie and just put a twist on it. For me, it\u2019s still about classic hairdressing and beautiful lines and silhouettes. That\u2019s how I design hair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriend has certainly had her share of experience with period styles, having also headed the hair departments of Miles Ahead, The Help, Django Unchained, Rock of Ages and Dreamgirls. But whether it\u2019s long and flowing or elaborately braided and twisted, one thing you won\u2019t see in Black Panther is any straightened hair. For Friend, natural hair textures were a major part of her contribution to the visual narrative.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a beautiful time where people are wearing their natural hair,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, there [are] women everywhere who are like, \u2018Throw the pressing comb away, throw the relaxer away. I\u2019m going to wear my natural hair.\u2019 So that whole movement of the empowerment of the hair is there,\u201d Friend explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a diverse universe of naturally styled characters involved a team highly skilled in styling, caring for and mimicking natural hairstyles, as in the case of Angela Bassett\u2019s glorious custom-made wig of 24-inch silvery locs, inspired in equal parts by writer Toni Morrison and director Ryan Coogler\u2019s mother, Joselyn.\n\nBut while Friend isn\u2019t playing favorites on the styles she created, she\u2019s already seeing the influence this film is having on our beauty and fashion choices. She\u2019s received countless raves on the twisted crop Lupita Nyong\u2019o rocks as Dora Milaje operative Nakia and graciously provided The Glow Up with the how-to (hint: The key is keeping it close to the scalp):\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018Wakanda knot\u2019\u2014because it is different than a Bantu knot,\u201d she tells us. \u201c[Because] basically, the hair is rolled down, kind of like a cinnamon roll. And then, once the hair is dried, then, we lifted it from there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEducating other hairstylists is a huge part of Friend\u2019s career, as her greatest hope is to see more hairstylists performing at the top of their game. That\u2019s why she created Hair Scholars, a consortium of award-winning artists led by Friend in educating and preparing aspiring stylists to be the best at their craft and ready to work in the industry.\n\nFriend knows firsthand the value of having a talented team by her side. She credits her Black Panther team for being a large part of the inspiration and craftsmanship that we\u2019ll see on-screen next week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt just felt like our brains\u2014the brainpower was just so high, and the energy was so high, just because we got to create,\u201d she says. \u201cOr somebody\u2019s like, \u2018Well, let\u2019s try this.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Let\u2019s try it!\u2019\n\n\u201cSo it was really great to have that think tank, where we could just be in there and be creating, and just really coming up with things on the fly ... just really having the momentum just to create original pieces that are going to stand the test of time on film,\u201d she continues.\n\nAnd of course, we couldn\u2019t end our conversation without asking Friend how it felt to be on the purple carpet for Black Panther\u2019s epic premiere in Los Angeles last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe premiere was like, you know, it was like 2018 Coming to America\u2014like, it was for real. People took it all the way,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think what it is too, is as black people, we have like\u2014especially now\u2014there\u2019s a sense of pride. People are wearing their hair natural. People are [saying] \u2018black excellence.\u2019 People are rising to the occasion, and I think this movie comes at the time where black people, we want to step forward; we want to be recognized.\n\n\u201cThis movie hits all the right notes for having a black superhero,\u201d she explains. \u201cI mean, at the end of the day, we all want to be superheroes, in whatever we do. If we\u2019re a mom, if we\u2019re a secretary, if we\u2019re a hairdresser\u2014whatever we do, we all want to be a superhero.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re an Los Angeles-based hair artist, you can join Camille Friend for a Hair Scholars master class at the \u201cHair and Makeup by ... \u201d Symposium on March 11 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.", "keywords": ["natural", "traditional", "hair", "black", "hero", "really", "teamsupernatural", "movie", "panther", "meet", "panthers", "having", "think", "friend", "camille", "designer"], "polarity": 0.17398076259489295, "subjectivity": 0.5284920634920632},

Listen, when Living Single debuted in August of \u201993, I knew immediately that I wanted to be Khadijah James (played by Queen Latifah). She had my dream job (editor of a hip-hop magazine), lived in my dream city (New York City) and dressed exactly how I wanted to dress.\n\nKhadijah was just the right amount of butch, with a cool, relaxed streetwear feel. I longed for the many African-American College Alliance sweatshirts, hoodies, T-shirts and hats that filled her closet. Plus, Queen Latifah is a curvy woman, so I felt like she rocked styles that would also work for me. I imagined that her wardrobe of tailored suits with the colorful vests underneath would fit me perfectly!\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nI spent most of the \u201980s tuned into pop, vintage soul and hair bands, with most hip-hop on my periphery. But late-\u201980s new jack swing caught my attention, as artists started sampling, remaking and covering my beloved old-school soul and R&B artists. In 1992, when Dr. Dre dropped The Chronic, I recognized the rhythms from my childhood escapes into my pop\u2019s record collection.\n\nG-funk lifted the beauty of the bass, synth and live instrumental tracks of Parliament-Funkadelic to combine it with deep 808s. I would often point out to my friends that I\u2019d already introduced them to the music they were bumping out of their speakers; and as the lyricism got tighter and R&B increased its flirtation with hip-hop, I found myself falling for not only the music but also the fashion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the \u201990s, I was too broke to afford the clothes I wanted to wear. I was often underemployed and occasionally more worried about housing than clothing; but flipping through the Source magazine, I\u2019d envision myself rocking Timberlands and Tommy Hilfiger with baggy jeans. I wanted to wear my hair in braids and sport baseball caps and bubble coats or Starter jackets. I couldn\u2019t buy Air Force 1s, but I spent a lot of time just drooling over them in Foot Locker.\n\nWhen Higher Learning hit theaters in 1995, I had my first real date with a woman. I\u2019d had a girlfriend years before, but we were so closeted we moved through our own internalized homophobia as \u201cbest friends.\u201d Higher Learning helped evolve not only my political consciousness but also my sense of style. I envied Busta\u2019s dreads (my hair could never do that) and may not have had Cube\u2019s Chucks, but seeing both of them on-screen helped push my relationship with my gender expression forward.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the time the film Set It Off premiered a year later, I\u2019d just finished reading the classic novel Stone Butch Blues, by the late Leslie Feinberg. I was finally attempting to figure out my gender expression and how I wanted to present to the world. Feinberg\u2019s novel felt like a revelation to me and finally gave me an identity to aspire to: butch.\n\nBack then, I didn\u2019t have much of an idea what \u201cbutch\u201d meant except through the lens of that book, so I began to fashion\u2014at least in my mind\u2014what that meant for me. When I saw Set It Off, I fell completely in love with the image of another iconic Latifah character, Cleo. I, too, wanted to be stone butch with a badass, blond-\u2019fro-rocking black femme by my side.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Love Jones rolled around in 1997, I was hanging out in chat rooms and connecting with a world of black lesbians. I\u2019d firmly established myself as a stud, and aspired to be a spoken-word artist. I devoured that movie, believing that it painted an accurate picture of black, middle-class life in Chicago\u2014my new dream city.\n\n\n\nI loved Love Jones and its romance with culture and music and poetry. The leather jackets and boots felt reminiscent of the \u201970s, while the blue tones of the cinematography felt simultaneously familiar and fresh, like a new jack Gordon Parks photo album. I imagined myself being as cool as the film\u2019s hero, Darius, and while Nia Long\u2019s Nina was beautiful, I wanted to fall in love with Lisa Nicole Carson.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of these pop-cultural touchstones exposed me to a range of black aesthetics. The beauty of \u201990s fashion was its fluidity, the way it brought together the masculine and the feminine. In many ways, women were able to play with gender norms and identity by poaching clothes from their boyfriends, male cousins, brothers or friends, adding feminine touches like bamboo earrings or large hoops (I\u2019ve always been a hoop boi).\n\nI spent the \u201990s in search of what being butch/stud/masculine of center meant to me. My own emerging style was heavily influenced not only by seeing us on-screen but by up-and-coming black-owned brands like FUBU, Sean John and Phat Farm\u2014brands that highlighted the reality that hip-hop had long moved out of New York City\u2019s South Bronx and was on its way to becoming a global commodity.\n\nBut I often wonder when the shift happened in women\u2019s clothing. Back in the \u201990s, it felt like there was a range of female expression\u2014from Lil\u2019 Kim and Foxy Brown to Queen Latifah and Lauryn Hill. The women of Bad Boy famously cultivated a femme-aggressive look, mixing hard and soft together. When did women stop being able to rock a hoodie and baggy jeans and still be considered sexy? When did fashion for women become more about how much skin we\u2019re showing?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe it\u2019s always been that way, and I\u2019d just rather remember it differently.\n\nWhile there are definitely some fashions we should leave in the \u201990s (backward clothing, Cross Colours, shiny leather suits\u2014or really any leather suits\u2014and patchwork jeans), the \u201990s were a decade of revolutionary style. Aside from helping a young stud find her way, it was an era that helped a generation of Xers make a mark on a world eager to ignore them\u2014with swag to spare.", "keywords": ["90s", "felt", "latifah", "shaped", "living", "way", "style", "hiphop", "butch", "women", "id", "wanted", "jones", "single", "love"], "polarity": 0.17467765209700697, "subjectivity": 0.47019852906949694},

And we can\u2019t breathe one word about that evening\u2019s red carpet without acknowledging our current and forever #Fave, Yara Shahidi. Like, we may have to come up with a concept stronger than #Goals to explain how we feel about her.\n\n\n\nWhen the 17-year-old shining star stepped on that SAG Awards red carpet, we collectively gasped\u2014and haven\u2019t taken a breath since. She snatched every one of our wigs that night, from her full, flowing mane and face glossed by Chanel all the way to the trailing train of her custom Ralph Lauren jumpsuit. And we can\u2019t forget to mention the exaggerated back bow detail that added the perfect touch of whimsy to an otherwise sophisticated silhouette. Every single thing was right about that look.\n\nPersonally, I just had to know the details of her beyond-glam makeup and to-the-heavens hair. After a little cyber searching, I came across the two boss babes responsible for Yara\u2019s carpet-crushing hair and makeup. After doing some gushing about the magic they created, I was able to tease out step-by-step instructions on how to re-create the textured tresses and flawless makeup from the red carpet\u2014product details and all!\n\n\n\nHairstylist to the stars Nai\u2019vasha Johnson is the real deal, having magnified the manes of many of our celebrity faves, including Zendaya, Uzo Aduba, songbirds (and Yara\u2019s Grown-ish co-stars) Chloe x Halle, Dear White People\u2019s Logan Browning and Chewing Gum\u2019s Michaela Coel. Represented by Exclusive Artists Management, this celebrity hairstylist is a master, whether working with wigs and extensions, braided works of art or textured tresses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith all of this talent, Johnson is more than just a hair expert. She has often spoken up in support of female-focused platforms, as well as addressing some of the pressures put on black women to alter their hair for cultural approval. For this mother of two daughters\u2014one who has decided to keep her hair natural and another with a relaxer\u2014the priority is on healthy hair and a woman\u2019s right to choose and not feel pressured to conform. Her focus is healthy hair, in whatever form that means for any woman she is working with.\n\nTo achieve Yara\u2019s showstopping look last Sunday, Johnson used products from natural-hair-care maven Taliah Waajid. Johnson says: \u201cThe inspiration was glamorous Diana Ross. I wanted her beautiful texture delicately brushed out.\u201d\n\nJohnson graciously gave us a detailed step-by-step on how she created Yara\u2019s blown-out brown bombshell style for the SAG Awards:\n\nSaturate damp hair from root to tip with the Taliah Waajid Green Apple and Aloe Nutrition Leave-In Conditioner. Brush hair thoroughly with a boar-bristle brush to evenly distribute the product. Dry hair with a diffuser. Add a quarter size of Taliah Waajid Curly Curl Cream to define curls and add shine.

An acknowledged survivor of sexual assault herself, Oprah viewed this moment as a culmination of so many stories, catalyzed by a few not-so-good men:\n\nEverything that\u2019s happened has brought us to this point in time. We\u2019ve been working our way through a lot of repressed pain, anger, shame, and disappointment. And we weren\u2019t honoring our own voices.

Maybe it\u2019s time for me to do something too.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those of us starting to navigate middle age, she gives us insight into an authenticity that\u2019s genuinely worth looking forward to:\n\nYou take no shit.

As she told Newsweek in 2017:\n\nWhat I do now, when I\u2019m taking on a film, I always ask about the fairness of the pay. I ask what they\u2019re offering me in comparison to the guy. I don\u2019t care about how much I get paid; I\u2019m in an industry where we\u2019re overcompensated for the work we do. But I don\u2019t want to be on a set where I\u2019m doing the same work as someone else and they\u2019re getting five times what I\u2019m getting.\n\nSo when Chastain approached Oscar-winning actress Octavia Spencer about doing a holiday comedy with her (the two first appeared together in 2011\u2019s The Help), the discussion naturally turned to the gender wage gap. But what Chastain wasn\u2019t prepared for was the wage gap she\u2019d yet to consider: how much less actresses of color make than their white counterparts.\n\nGood friend Spencer quickly brought her up to speed\u2014a conversation she recounted last week while on the Women Breaking Barriers panel at the Sundance Film Festival (Spencer\u2019s revelation begins at the 19:30 mark):\n\nWomen Breaking Barriers panel at Sundance 2018 (Golden Globes/YouTube screenshot)\n\nWe were dropping f-bombs and getting it all out there. And then I said, \u201cBut here\u2019s the thing: Women of color on that spectrum, we make far less than white women. So if we\u2019re gonna have that conversation about pay equity, we gotta bring the women of color to the table.\u201d And I told her my story, and we talked numbers, and she was quiet, and she said she had no idea that that\u2019s what it was like for women of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChastain did more than listen; she committed to bringing her new knowledge to the negotiating table, brokering what she called a \u201cfavored nations\u201d deal. As Spencer recalls:\n\nShe said: \u201cOctavia, we\u2019re gonna get you paid on this film. You and I are gonna be tied together. We\u2019re gonna be favored nations, and we\u2019re gonna make the same thing.\u201d\n\nChastain\u2019s negotiations sparked a bidding war for the film, which will be produced by Chastain and released by Universal Pictures, and resulted in salaries five times higher than what was initially offered, making Spencer\u2019s salary as an actor equal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Chastain told Business Insider in 2016:\n\nWe really need to look at ourselves and say we need to reevaluate this. We need to reevaluate women who ask for a pay raise or ask for a promotion. It\u2019s actually an okay thing. It\u2019s okay to be ambitious, it\u2019s okay to be over-prepared.\n\nIt may be the type of story that for some will evoke tropes of the \u201cwhite savior,\u201d or the much overused (and often misunderstood) term \u201cwhite allies.\u201d But for Spencer, it\u2019s simply an example of how true allies can effectively use their privilege for positive change: \u201cI love that woman, because she\u2019s walking the walk and she\u2019s actually talking the talk.\u201d", "keywords": ["spencer", "octavia", "gonna", "privilege", "ask", "helped", "white", "pay", "im", "film", "earn", "told", "women", "jessica", "worth", "chastain"], "polarity": 0.2190909090909091, "subjectivity": 0.3655952380952381},

Blige\u2019s glow up this awards season; in fact, we\u2019re not sure we\u2019ve stanned this hard for her since What\u2019s the 411? The singer and actress has been nominated for Golden Globe, Critics Choice and Screen Actors Guild awards, and now a history-making two Oscar nods for both her performance and original song in Dee Rees\u2019 Mudbound. And she has stunned us on every single red carpet.\n\nBut those stunning looks have a secret weapon in a longtime member of Blige\u2019s team: celebrity makeup artist D\u2019Andre Michael. Knowing how much we wanted the 411 on Blige\u2019s super-fly SAG Awards look, Michael let The Glow Up in on a surprisingly low-priced secret: He exclusively used products from Black Opal.\n\nYes, THAT Black Opal (its Instagram is kind of poppin\u2019, by the way). In Michael\u2019s words:\n\nI\u2019ve been working with Mary J. Blige for years, and I love trying new looks on her. I wanted to create a showstopping look using Black Opal for her first-time appearance at the SAG Awards. Once I saw her gown, I knew I wanted to transform her into an elegant smoked goddess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was smokin\u2019 indeed, styled by fashion fave Law Roach in a one-shouldered black-and-white gown with a dramatic wing motif by designer Jean-Louis Sabaji.\n\nMichael, who\u2019s been on Blige\u2019s team for over a decade, complemented her dress and sleek modern hairstyle with a perfect smoky eye atop glowing skin, using Black Opal all the way. He shared with The Glow Up why, after years of working with the superstar, this awards season is such a special one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up: As a longtime member of Mary J. Blige\u2019s team, what\u2019s it like to work with her during this groundbreaking phase of her career?\n\nD\u2019Andre Michael: Having been with Mary J. Blige now for 11 years, we are more like family. I am so proud and honored to be a part of this moment with her. I\u2019m happy and overjoyed with her continued success, but this is like the stepping-stone to something I know she has been passionate [about]. It\u2019s amazing to see the acknowledgment and praise she is receiving for her work as an actress. I\u2019m like a proud brother.\n\nTGU: Mary\u2019s looks have been phenomenal at every event. How are you able to keep her looks so fresh?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDM: I have been with her every step of the way: Every award show, every red carpet, press junket, television show, etc. It\u2019s always been my thing to make her look good every time.\n\nMaybe because she\u2019s on a different platform now, a broader audience is taking note, but nothing has changed much with what we do. It\u2019s being there as a support for her in all that she\u2019s going through personally, making sure her spirits are up and she feels good about herself and comfortable with how she looks, what she\u2019s wearing, etc. So I think what shines through mostly is her \u201chappy\u201d\u2014and when you feel good internally, it shows externally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: You used exclusively Black Opal for Mary\u2019s SAG Awards look. Tell us why we should be checking for drugstore brands, and why Black Opal works so well for our tones?\n\nDM: I have never been one to follow trends or fads, mainly because trends come and go, and fads fade away. However, staying true to myself as an artist and finding things that work for me to use on my clients is most important. That\u2019s above any brand\u2014whether it is department store, drugstore or specialty store.\n\nI have learned just because something has a name brand on it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s suitable for what I need to use it for. Therefore, it is all about the quality of a product, and sometimes the most expensive product isn\u2019t necessarily the best. A lot of my favorite go-to products are drugstore brands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy friend Sam Fine worked with Black Opal years ago and helped them with their colors and palettes. Even then, I realized It was a brand that I could trust, because he\u2019s an amazing artist that I respect and call a friend. So if Sam trusts them, I know I can.\n\nDM: Black Opal has always been a staple for having a great color range for women of color; from the fairest of women to the darkest, you could trust you are in good hands with the Black Opal brand, and the formula is great. It gives great coverage that you could work with, whether you need a light coverage to a complete coverage. The Black Opal True Color Skin Perfecting Stick Foundation is amazing! It is great to see they are still around and providing women of color and us professionals with great colors and a great formula.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: At 47, Mary looks incredible. Can you talk about how makeup differs for women in her age group?\n\nDM: The only difference is probably the fads and trends you may want to stay away from with a more mature woman. In terms of looks, you definitely want to use less powder and more products that enhance a dewier look.\n\nFor eyes, most to all women can carry a smoky eye. Many think \u201csmoky eye,\u201d and they think black or dark. But you can smoke your eyes with almost any color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn terms of skin, I like to do my concealer, then apply my foundation, next set with a powder, and maybe spritz your face with a mister or the Evian mist spray to infuse the powder and foundation. Next, let it air-dry to take away the powdered look so you have more of a dewy skin appearance.\n\nIlluminators work as well, but know that sometimes these can come across drab and chalky looking if you use the wrong color. For women of color, I recommend an illuminator in the flesh-tone range (bronzy or mauve, etc.), and stay away from pearl color or yellows or orange-based colors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, even after all that great advice, we couldn\u2019t let Michael go without getting his step-by-step for creating Blige\u2019s SAG look, and all the products he used. How else are we going to plan for our next shopping trip?\n\nFor the Face\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the Eyes\n\nTo sculpt and define Blige\u2019s eyes, Michael used the Black Opal Aurora Eyeshadow Palette. First, he used the Brazen Copper shade on her entire eyelid. Next, he added Brazen Bronze on her crease, adding the Bordeaux Beige shade along the brow bone as a highlight.\n\n\n\nMichael then finished the eye look with Black Opal Color Splurge Automatic Eye Lining Pencil in Licorice, adding it along the lash line and inner lid and smudging to create a smoky look. Note: This eye pencil is formulated with aloe vera and chamomile extracts that help to soothe the delicate eye area as you define it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Lasting Lip\n\nFor the finishing touches to Blige\u2019s look, Michael used Black Opal Lip Color Splurge Stick Lip in Purr, a soft, pale-pink color enriched with emollient butters and vitamins C&E. This lipstick provides a bright, pigment-rich color that provides a smooth, creamy, nondrying finish.\n\nNo word yet on what Blige\u2019s look will be for the 90th Academy Awards on March 4. But even after Michael works his magic, we know the finishing touch will really be Mary J. Blige\u2019s happiness.

The #MeToo founder has been rightfully getting her shine since the movement bearing the name she coined caught Hollywood\u2019s attention last fall. In the months since, she has appeared on red carpets, been honored in Time magazine, and become a regular on the talk and news show circuits.\n\nBut amid all the fanfare, the one thing Burke has never neglected is her mission to support and protect black and brown girls and women, a point she made abundantly clear when she appeared on Comedy Central\u2019s The Opposition With Jordan Klepper on Thursday\u2014her segment begins at the 15:31 mark.\n\n\u201cWe started #MeToo because it was an exchange of empathy between survivors, to let them know that they\u2019re not alone,\u201d she said.\n\nSince Klepper\u2019s show is satirical, he naturally played devil\u2019s advocate when discussing the need and motives of #MeToo, voicing the increasingly irrational concerns of men who likely feel that the movement endangers their right to sexual entitlement. When asked by Klepper about the danger of conflating sexual harassment and assault under the umbrella of a single hashtag, Burke illustrated the larger danger of ignoring the insidious nature of sexual harassment:\n\nThere\u2019s no conflation; there\u2019s actually a spectrum. And so, sexual harassment and sexual abuse and sexual violence are on a spectrum. On one end, we have sexual harassment, which creates hostile environments and make people uncomfortable and really open a gateway for more intense violence. So they can all live under the same hashtag.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe went on to point out that #MeToo\u2019s actual mission is \u201cempowerment through empathy\u201d\u2014a mission that we share here at The Glow Up. When Klepper playfully quipped that he thought empathy to be synonymous with weakness, Burke very seriously replied:\n\nEmpathy is actually the opposite of weakness; it is the power between two people. ... When one person says to another person, \u201cMe too,\u201d that person has shared something about a trauma that they experienced. The other person is empowered by that; it\u2019s the power in knowing that you\u2019re not alone, it\u2019s the power in knowing that somebody believes you, and hears you, and sees you, and is there for you.\n\nBut ever the comedian, Klepper wasn\u2019t done, ribbing Burke on why she continues to fix her social media gaze upon alleged serial sexual abuser and pedophile R. Kelly. Through Klepper\u2019s satirical lens, Kelly\u2019s only relevance should be related to his record releases. Burke coolly responded with the clapback of the night: \u201cYou know what else he hasn\u2019t released? The women that he\u2019s holding captive in houses in Atlanta and Chicago.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I tell you that I stood up and applauded and whooped with the studio audience! And as always, Burke brought the movement back to black and brown girls and their specific vulnerability\u2014and invisibility\u2014in discussions of sexual abuse.\n\n[P]eople tend to not care about things that affect the most marginalized amongst us. [Kelly\u2019s] victims, the people who he seeks out are vulnerable girls who come from vulnerable communities, and they look like me, mostly. ... [N]ow\u2014largely because of this movement\u2014we are bringing more attention to people like R.

Leeds said she was traveling for business during the 1980s when a stewardess asked if she wanted to be moved to first class. There, she said, she met Trump. She told the Times that she and Trump chatted a bit, and that before long, he moved the armrest and started assaulting her.

People magazine published an article late Wednesday evening titled, \"Attacked by Donald Trump.\" Natasha Stoynoff, a writer for the magazine who worked what she called \"the Trump beat,\" recounted an experience she said she had with Trump while working on a feature on the real estate mogul's first-year wedding anniversary to wife Melania in 2005.\n\n\"We walked into that room alone, and Trump shut the door behind us.

Years before her success as a television host, she dominated New York City radio as a shock jock obsessed with celebrity gossip and provocative chitchat.\n\nShe spat vitriol that scathed her targets and caused many of them to retaliate, most notably Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs back in 1998, after she spread rumors that he was gay. The hip-hop mogul flexed his influence so hard, Williams was blackballed in her industry, bringing her career to a full stop for a number of years. But it was as clear then as it is today that she gives zero fucks about what rolls off her tongue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of this #MeToo movement,\u201d she said during her show\u2019s \u201cHot Topics\u201d segment. \u201cI love that people are speaking up for the first time and coming out and everything, but now it\u2019s got\u2014I look at all men like, \u2018You\u2019re a #MeToo.\u2019 All of them. All of them, which is not fair.\u201d\n\nAnd in response to the recent #MuteRKelly campaign, Williams had this to say: \u201cWhat is this, 10 years too late? It\u2019s not going to work. Black people aren\u2019t really good at protesting. Not since the King march ... R. Kelly wasn\u2019t a \u2018me too.\u2019 Aaliyah voluntarily married him when she was 15 years old. Her parents voluntarily let her do it.\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019 recent comments in response to the #MeToo and #MuteRKelly campaigns are, in my opinion, her most vile and disgusting to date. Not only did she de-emphasize the activists\u2019 initiative to aggressively protest at R. Kelly performances (at whatever point in time), but she argued on the crooner\u2019s behalf. Williams basically absolved Kelly, co-signed his statutory conduct and lambasted the young women who were linked to him.\n\n\n\nHer level of victim-blaming is both disturbing and reckless. Williams chided late songstress Aaliyah\u2014and, inaccurately, her parents\u2014for consenting to marriage with the R&B pervert. She also claimed that the teen girls who are currently part of Kelly\u2019s harem are willing participants\u2014and faulted their parents for that, too. And perhaps worst of all, the host also told her viewers that the 13-year-old girl allegedly featured in Kelly\u2019s sex tape\u2014whom he purportedly urinated on\u2014\u201cwas down with it.\u201d All because Williams is \u201csick of the #MeToo movement.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrankly, I am sick of Wendy Williams.\n\nWilliams\u2019 statements and defense of R. Kelly are a slap in the face to female survivors of sexual abuse, vulnerable girls and the movements that advocate for them. She is one of many black women whose thinking is so patriarchal, they engage in a brand of misogynoir that is not only foul AF, but downright dangerous.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s internalized racism and internalized misogyny,\u201d Stacey Patton told The Glow Up. Patton is assistant professor of multimedia journalism at Morgan State University and the author of Spare the Kids: Why Whupping Children Won\u2019t Save Black America. She said:\n\nThere\u2019s a long tradition of this, deeply tied to the history of slavery and racism. One of the core features of the racialization of black bodies is to create this narrative that they\u2019re sexual deviants. Black [women] have participated in that discourse, softly believing that if they adhere to rules about what it means to be a virtuous woman, that somehow it makes us more acceptable to society. So we can\u2019t, even in our imagination, believe young black girls can be victimized in this way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams\u2019 narrative reeks of toxic femininity. In many black communities and households alike, young girls are emotionally victimized\u2014largely by women, long before they encounter men. They are unfairly sexualized according to their attitudes, bodies and mannerisms. Some of us may be familiar with the term \u201cacting womanish\u201d being directed at black girls. For those who are not, Dorothy Randall Tsuruta made it plain in her article for the Western Journal of Black Studies, where she explained:\n\n[The] culturally-derived concept, womanish (\u201cmannish\u201d for boys) is rooted in the social practice of Black adults, especially Black women, setting boundaries for Black girls.\n\nThough writer Alice Walker is sympathetic in redefining the expression to embolden young girls with womanish characteristics, many women remain stuck on its original connotations. They wax old toxic philosophies onto innocent girls\u2014much as Williams does, when she faults underage girls for their engagement with Kelly\u2014knowing full well that the law and power dynamics involved clearly define them as prey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t divorce that shaming of young black girls from the [parent] shaming we see online,\u201d Patton said, speaking of the extremes some women will go to to guilt their daughters.\n\nNothing good comes from this toxic policing of our girls. It upholds the patriarchal idea that black girls are fast-ass Jezebels who are sexually mature beyond their years and need to be subdued. It denies them the opportunity to be exactly who they are\u2014young girls. This castigation chips away their confidence, diminishes their self-esteem and stunts their agency. It robs them of the tools needed to protect themselves from being exploited\u2014sexually or otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams\u2019 dismissal of black women\u2019s agency is akin to silencing them. In a broader context, it contributes to the erasure of black women\u2014as if patriarchy, white feminism and the world at-large don\u2019t already have that task covered.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this before\u2014when the FBI, white liberals and activist groups tried to suppress the female voices of #BlackLivesMatter by co-opting their agenda. More recently, we saw it when ESPN suspended Jemele Hill for \u201ca second violation of social media guidelines\u201d\u2014also known as expressing her views as a black woman about a \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d president. The attempt to quiet black women is overwhelming, and where we don\u2019t need it is in spaces or conversations among our own.\n\nThe #MuteRKelly campaign is long overdue. For over 20 years, Kelly has reportedly engaged in felonious sex with underage women and allegedly continues to do so with impunity. This is mainly because the black community has not held Kelly or other sexual miscreants like him accountable. The fact that the #MuteRKelly campaign\u2019s creators, Kenyette Barnes and Oronike Odeleye, have come through to do the extreme lifting that no one else bothered to do speaks volumes to their commitment to black woman and girls. That Williams denigrates their efforts by stating, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work,\u201d further confirms that she does not value the voices of black women or their resistance.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOdeleye considers the slight a plus, telling The Glow Up:\n\nBy bringing up the #MuteRKelly discussion on the national stage, Wendy Williams helped spread the message that there are black women nationwide standing united to end the sexual, physical and mental abuse of our young black women. . .Wherever R. Kelly is performing, we\u2019ll be there. We won\u2019t rest until we have, at the very least, ended his career. We are working with the victims, victims\u2019 families and attorneys to bring yet another criminal case against him. We plan to be a needle in his side until he\u2019s in the poor house, a mental facility or a jail cell.\n\nTarana Burke, founder of the Me Too movement, also feels that Kelly\u2019s time is up and that he should not be \u201cconveniently\u201d left out of conversations on sexual assault, especially among black women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlack women are just as vocal about giving R. Kelly a chance. I\u2019ve seen Facebook statuses that say, \u2018I don\u2019t care who [R. Kelly] is fucking, I\u2019m going to see him tonight\u2014I\u2019m buying my ticket,\u2019\u201d Burke stated in a phone interview with The Glow Up.\n\nThe Me Too movement founded by Burke in 2006 is not be confused with the latest #MeToo movement tied to the sexual harassment and rape of women in Hollywood. Although the two intersect today, initially they did not. Burke\u2019s movement was specifically started for underserved black girls from low-income communities who were sexually victimized and in need of supportive healing.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Burke responded to Williams\u2019 inflammatory comments:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSexual violence knows no race, color, class or gender, but the response to sexual violence does,\u201d Burke said in our interview. \u201cThe response to sexual violence is highly gendered and highly racialized and definitely defined by class.\u201d\n\nYeah, that part.\n\nIt is this nuance that allows R. Kelly to get off scot-free. Williams is reckless and clearly driven by her black female antagonism in not making these distinctions. That Williams (and black women of the same ilk) can afford to be so \u201csick of\u201d #MeToo is really quite disconcerting. In the same vein as Kelly, she is both a trigger and the gun, busting shots at black women, exploiting them and denying their humanity. Like R. Kelly, Wendy is out here wildin\u2019, and she, too, needs to be put on mute.", "keywords": ["wildin", "black", "girls", "kelly", "assault", "muterkelly", "r", "williams", "wendy", "metoo", "young", "women", "comes", "twisted", "sexual"], "polarity": 0.01676189520560382, "subjectivity": 0.48182343778370257},

But only a brief year before, a judge had ruled against pop star Kesha in her own exhaustive sexual abuse trial in favor of Sony Music and her alleged abuser, producer Dr. Luke.\n\nIn this watershed moment, what would the music industry have to offer when its own moment of reckoning has so far seemed muted, at best? This was the concern shared by Voices in Entertainment, a grassroots group initiated by female music execs concerned that the movement wasn\u2019t effectively reaching the music industry. Their first initiative? An email encouraging Grammy Awards attendees to wear white roses, in what would hopefully become the music industry\u2019s version of the #TimesUp blackout on the Golden Globes red carpet.\n\nBut while there were many white roses and #TimesUp pins among the designer finery on the Grammys red carpet, the most powerful moment of the night would be onstage. During her introduction of what would be an emotional performance by Kesha, musician and actress Janelle Mon\u00e1e gave a compelling speech, reminding the audience assembled at New York City\u2019s Madison Square Garden and abroad:\n\nTonight, I am proud to stand in solidarity as not just an artist, but a young woman, with my fellow sisters in this room who make up the music industry. Artists, writers, assistants, publicists, CEOs, producers, engineers and women from all sectors of the business. We are also daughters, wives, mothers, sisters and human beings. We come in peace, but we mean business. And to those who would dare try to silence us, we offer you two words: Time\u2019s up. We say time\u2019s up for pay inequality, time\u2019s up for discrimination, time\u2019s up for harassment of any kind, and time\u2019s up for the abuse of power.

We all know it\u2019s been hard to get over Barack: He took America to meet his family in Kenya, brought some flowers for the National Portrait Gallery; we all know he was a good guy and America misses him.\n\nSeriously, though, what nation in its right mind would want to stay with a leader who is constantly threatening the press, is mired in corruption and built his career on racism, and who was not only accused of rape but also led chants of \u201cBurn the bitch\u201d against his political opponent? All of this sounds a lot like Trump, and you\u2019d think America would say \u201cBoy, bye\u201d to that kind of leader\u2014but we\u2019re still playing \u201che picked me for less than the popular vote\u201d with President Crotch Grabber.\n\nBelieve it or not, the aforementioned actions are by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and/or South African President Jacob Zuma. But unlike the United States, those two nations have had enough and told their leaders that they\u2019ll be sleeping on the couch until the divorce is final. Who knew it would take two second world nations with a bit of backbone to remind America of how dating while democratic is supposed to get done?\n\nOn Tuesday, South Africa\u2019s ruling national party, the African National Congress, called for President Jacob Zuma to step down by Valentine\u2019s Day or face a no-confidence vote. And you know what? He did it. You know that old anthem \u201cWhen a Nation\u2019s Fed Up\u201d? Well, Zuma had this coming to him.\n\nFrom 2005 to the present day, Jacob Zuma has been on one. He\u2019s spent the last decade fighting off 783 counts of bribery and racketeering from an illegal arms deal. He was charged with raping an HIV-positive daughter of a political ally, then claimed that he \u201ctook a shower\u201d after sex to make sure he didn\u2019t have HIV. Then he went outside the courtroom and led chants of \u201cBurn the bitch.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen he \u201cconsensually\u201d knocked up another friend\u2019s daughter. A friend who happened to be chairman of the South African World Cup committee and owner of the popular Orlando Pirates soccer team. That would be like Trump knocking up Patriots owner Robert Kraft\u2019s daughter, then turning around and asking him to promote Boston as the next Summer Olympics site. Zuma did most of this after he was elected to office in 2009. Yes, South Africa was ready to swipe left.\n\nSince Valentine\u2019s Day seems to be the perfect opportunity to cut out of a bad relationship while you still can, the Israeli government has followed the South African example.\n\nOn Tuesday, Israeli police announced that they had \u201csufficient evidence\u201d to charge Prime Minister Benjamin \u201cBibi\u201d Netanyahu with bribery, fraud and \u201cbreach of trust.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNetanyahu, who has been in office since \u201909, tried to buy off a newspaper that was critical of him, authorities charge. Then, in exchange for expensive gifts and favors, he arranged for visas and tried to push through a massive tax cut for Arnon Milchan, a big-time Hollywood producer ( movies like Pretty Woman, JFK and 12 Years a Slave) who wanted to move to Israel, officials say.\n\nHow did Bibi get caught and who ratted him out? Yair Lapid, leader of the Yesh Atid party that is part of Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition, dropped a dime on the prime minister and has publicly asked him to step down from power. When asked by the press why he stood up to Netanyahu\u2019s pressure, he said:\n\nIn this instance as in other instances, Yesh Atid was the last barrier against government corruption, in the face of politicians occupied solely with themselves and their own well-being.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBang, bang! Shots fired!\n\nCan you imagine House Speaker Paul Ryan or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ever flipping for special counsel Robert Mueller because the Republican Party was the last barrier against corruption? Can you imagine the Republican Party standing up to Trump\u2019s various wife-beating, sexually assaulting cronies and calling for their removal? Of course not. These guys think #MeToo is a call-and-response for who gets to kiss Trump\u2019s butt at the next staff meeting.\n\nIn high school, we\u2019re taught that American presidents are kept in check by more checks and balances than a block of Wells Fargos, but nobody is doing anything in America about Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet, less democratic states like South Africa have managed to remove a corrupt leader, and in Israel, even if Netanyahu puts up a fight, it\u2019s clear that members of his own coalition are willing to hold him accountable if he strays too far.\n\nAmerica used to be savage like that. The Senate voted on Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment right before Valentine\u2019s Day, over a blow job. Yet somehow, the nation has lost its way with the current trash president, while others act like the nation we used to be.\n\nOn Wednesday, the ANC bought Zuma a nice Nando\u2019s gift certificate and a one-way ticket to GTFOH-istan. In Israel, if Netanyahu somehow survives the charges against him, there\u2019s no chance he\u2019ll be his party\u2019s leader by the 2019 elections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerica should totally join the Break Up With Your Terrible Leader Club today.

I, at least, understood that he wanted to touch my leg and, likely, my pussy\u2014and ole boy understood that he could.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where dudes get it twisted.\n\nMany men presume that it is OK to project onto women their sexual impulses and violence in physical ways. And patriarchy is mostly to blame.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this week\u2019s episode of patriarchal fuckery, actor-comedian Aziz Ansari was accused of hypersexual insensitivity. A now exhaustively debated expos\u00e9 published by online magazine Babe tells the story of an anonymous woman, given the pseudonym Grace, who claims to have found herself in a compromising position with the entertainer.\n\nAllegedly, after a speedy dinner date, the 22-year-old woman accompanied Ansari to his apartment and engaged in mutual oral sex with him, after being \u201cclawed,\u201d fingered and pounced upon\u2014and even after \u201cgetting up and moving and him following and sticking his fingers down [her] throat again.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy her own admission, Grace acquiesced to sexual activity with Ansari, although she also acknowledges that she did not want to. The nature of what occurred between the two might not constitute sexual assault, but it puts the focus on fundamental glitches in modern dating and the normality of sexual misconduct.\n\nAnsari quickly issued a statement emphatically stating that \u201cby all indications [the encounter] was completely consensual,\u201d likely because everything appeared OK to him. He does not readily recognize his overtures as inappropriate. His claim absolves him of any intent to cause harm\u2014yet, by default, Grace is left to blame for her own distress.\n\nA male acquaintance of mine who has asked to remain anonymous stated, \u201cI would think that while the man is bearing all of the responsibility, she as a woman of agency and nonambiguity should advocate for herself and do what she has to in order to not let more bad happen.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an on-air attack, Wendy Williams blasted Grace: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just bite it and leave? \u2026 Why didn\u2019t you just grab your coat and leave, dummy?\u201d Williams asked scornfully.\n\nPerhaps they are all missing the point. Perhaps she liked him enough to renege on her usual self-standards. Perhaps she thought they\u2019d make a good couple with beautiful babies. Perhaps she was a groupie. Who knows? What we do know is that Grace was physically violated well before she took a position, well before she was browbeaten into giving a blow job and well before she gave in. Much like what happened in my situation, the point of consent was bypassed. None was given, but even worse, none was sought. It was a non-muthafuckin-factor.\n\nPeople must ask themselves why consent and communication are such an inconvenience.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe must also ask why we continue to court a tradition in which boys will be boys and men will be men, no matter their indiscretions, while women are held to a five-star standard of awareness, action and responsibility. We are centuries invested in men\u2019s entitlement and audacity, and their retarded understanding of and disrespect for women\u2019s bodily rights. We live in a society where patriarchy is well-established and chronically practiced.\n\nAuthor Kiese Laymon, a professor of English and African-American studies at the University of Mississippi, asserted this idea in an interview:\n\nThe nation encourages boys and men to \u201cget\u201d sex from women by any means necessary. We are trained to believe \u201cno\u201d means \u201cnot yet.\u201d And most of all, we are also trained not to care [for] or respect the millions of women who have taught us that consent is integral to healthy sex. We allow ourselves to be trained by patriarchy and not radical black feminism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile many people are adamant about the conjecture that Grace should have acted differently, several publications\u2014particularly The Guardian and The New York Times\u2014ran pieces that also accused Grace of undermining the #MeToo movement and lamenting a failed come up. Scores of social media users have questioned her choice to perform and receive head\u2014and then still call foul.\n\nFar too many conflate Grace\u2019s actions with permission, but that is a function of patriarchy. Giving in is not synonymous with giving consent\u2014although sometimes it is entirely necessary. Being a black woman, in particular, has its cost. According to the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research, black women are affected by violence\u2014physical and sexual\u2014at a much higher rate than women of other races. Navigating common spaces as a black woman informs me that speaking up and taking agency is not always in my best interest. Revisiting my own situation proved this.\n\nMy date that long-ago night was amused by my subtle rejection. He thought I was being coy. He drove to the nearest Holiday Inn, parked, checked in, then returned for me, hotel key in hand. I finally found the words: \u201cNah, I\u2019m good.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo his surprise, I rebuffed his expectation. To my surprise, his demeanor changed; his jawbone stiffened and he shut down. He drove off. We rode along a vacant Queens Boulevard in a thick silence. \u201cYou good?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s bitches like you that always shit on a good nigga that treats her right, but give ain\u2019t-shit niggas the pussy.\u201d\n\nI asked to be let out of the car. He refused. At a red light, I opened the car door and let myself out\u2014he got out, too. He followed me, apologized and insisted that I stop being dramatic and get back in the car. I refused. He hauled back and slapped the shit out of me. His handprint was pressed into the side of my face\u2014literally. He rescued my body from the ground and whispered, \u201cGet the fuck in the car and don\u2019t say a word, before this shit gets worse.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI got back into the car. He drove back to the hotel. He fucked me. I did not utter a word, and neither did he. What wasn\u2019t said was thoroughly communicated.\n\nContrary to popular opinion, women can remain silent or vocal, stay put or take flight, hold out or put out, and still get screwed. Many times, our decision to do so boils down to matters of life or death, or both. Despite what Wendy Williams proclaims, it is far from easy to bite a man\u2019s penis and flee from the scene without bodily harm. Yet with all things considered, women are still culpable for placing themselves in bad situations\u2014men, not so much. That is patriarchy at work.\n\nThis worldview, this flawed attitude, is due for serious change. Pushing the narrative of consent and communication is not about an indictment of \u201call men\u201d but, rather, about the predatory practice of too many. Consent isn\u2019t about suppressing sexual energy; it\u2019s about respecting a woman\u2019s right to sexually engage on her terms. Communication cannot rest solely on a set of cues. And the work cannot be left solely to women and the #MeToo movement. The responsibility rests upon all of our shoulders, especially those of men.

Some of the stories shared through the #MeToo movement have triggered a range of emotions and questions; some may have come off as \u201cgray areas.\u201d How do we actually know when we\u2019re giving or given consent?\n\nSo glad you asked. Sexual consent is when both parties agree to have sex\u2014throughout the encounter. Let\u2019s start with the basics\u2014we\u2019ll call it \u201cConsent 101\u201d\u2014and then explore some less orthodox situations:\n\n\n\nDo I Really Need to Hear a \u201cYes\u201d?\n\nWell, yeah. You do. Hearing \u201cyes\u201d from your partner is\u2014and should be\u2014sexy as fuck. Speaking personally, nothing turns me on more than a partner who respects my wishes and wants to know my needs. When the chemistry is there, then ask questions like, \u201cIs it OK to touch ___?\u201d or \u201cDo you mind if I ___?\u201d Some people might consider this a mood killer, but guess what? Jail time and being heavily judged by your peers as a rapist are definite libido killers.\n\nIf You\u2019re Not Sure, Question It\u2014and Actually Get a Confirmation\n\nThey didn\u2019t say no, but they didn\u2019t say yes, either. Again: You NEED confirmation from your partner. To assume is making an ass out of you and me; so take away the doubt and question it. And don\u2019t stop there\u2014actually get a solid answer. Most times, body language can tell you a lot, even without words. If your partner is getting tense, ask again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsent Isn\u2019t Only Given by a Woman\n\nAllow me to burst a few bubbles: Consent isn\u2019t something that\u2019s gender-specific. If you think women are exempt from being sexual predators, think again. And if you think men are excluded from being victims, you\u2019re delusional.\n\nHere are some alarming statistics: According to the Connecticut Alliance to End Sexual Assault, 1 in 6 men will be sexually assaulted in their lifetimes\u2014and 1 in 4 of those victims are under the age of 12. These statistics are not mentioned to make women feel that their issues don\u2019t matter, but we need to acknowledge that men can be affected by sexual trauma, too. And we definitely cannot exclude the transgender, genderqueer or nonconforming populace from the conversation\u2014a 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey (pdf) found that 47 percent of transgender people are assaulted in their lifetimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing the Same Sex Doesn\u2019t Give You a Hall Pass\n\nFrom personal experience, I\u2019ve lost count of how many women I\u2019ve had to check for attempting to disrespect my personal space. As a bisexual woman who owns her sexuality, I\u2019ve found that some people fetishize my sexual orientation.\n\nOne night, while barhopping with friends, a plus-one from our outing put her hand on my breasts. Startled, I jumped back and immediately questioned her motives. Despite expressing how her repulsive actions made me feel, she instantly dismissed my feelings, suggesting that I \u201cget over it.\u201d She even pointed to my vagina, to imply that we have the same body parts. It ruined my night, and thankfully, others no longer felt comfortable bringing her to future functions. Violation of anyone\u2019s personal space, same sex or not, is wrong\u2014on a moral and legal level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsent for One Thing Doesn\u2019t Mean Everything Is Covered\n\nJust because I agreed to one sexual act doesn\u2019t mean I consent to do other things. Also, what\u2019s comfortable today may not serve as a kink tomorrow. Frankly, we can be in bed together in the buff, and it doesn\u2019t warrant that we proceed any further than cuddling. If you can\u2019t handle that, state your boundaries up front, too.\n\nAnd While We\u2019re at It, I Can Stop at Any Time\n\nHold tight to your barf bag, boys and girls, because there are plenty of people who believe that if you start, both parties are obligated to finish the act. I don\u2019t care if you are five minutes away from climaxing; when I say stop, it means STOP. And it doesn\u2019t make me a prude or selfish; no simply means no. If there\u2019s even a possibility that your partner may want to slow down or is having second thoughts, with or without explanations, respect their wishes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in the BDSM World, No May Mean Yes\n\nDespite the stereotypes, BDSM is a lot more than just whips and chains. It is heavily dependent on trust in your partner. For those unfamiliar with the abbreviation, it\u2019s broken down into bondage, discipline/dominance, submission/sadism and masochism. As a \u201cswitch,\u201d I learned quickly about the importance of safe words when engaging in sexual activities with partners. Prior to the act, you should truly know your partner\u2019s desires and dislikes.\n\nMost important, establish safe words and touches and understand their body language. Without this discussion, things can go terribly wrong fairly quickly. Because words such as \u201cno\u201d and \u201cstop\u201d can be viewed as \u201cyes\u201d in the submissive and domination community, these terms are typically avoided as cues to stop during the act. Words like \u201cred,\u201d \u201cyellow\u201d and \u201cgreen\u201d\u2014reminiscent of traffic lights\u2014are great word selections. Know the difference between BDSM play and assault.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust a Thought: Avoid Vulnerable Partners\n\nAs an FYI, a heavily inebriated or exceptionally high partner cannot reliably give you consent. If your partner isn\u2019t coherent and you perform sexual acts with this person, this can later be considered equivalent to rape. Alcohol and drugs can impair someone\u2019s judgment severely. If the connection is truly there, ask and wait for validation when the other person is sober.\n\n\n\nIf They\u2019re Not of Legal Age, Guess What?\n\nDo I have to mention that minors also aren\u2019t legally allowed to consent to sexual relations with an adult? On that note: Parents should consider having conversations with teens before they enter junior high school. On average, Americans lose their virginity at 17 years old, but they are experimenting far earlier, so it\u2019s worth gradually sparking conversations about sex, protection and consent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParents: Don\u2019t view it as giving your children permission to lose their virginity, but more about their safety. Sexual education in school is on the decline, and caretakers should feel comfortable taking the responsibility to answer questions that their children may or may not have considered.\n\nRape and Sexual Harassment Are NOT Your Fault\n\nAbove all, know that you didn\u2019t ask for it. Rape and sexual harassment are not your fault. If you were raped or are uncertain whether you were sexually assaulted, please don\u2019t hesitate to seek assistance from organizations like RAINN, which will connect you to support groups or a talk therapist. Reach out to local authorities if you ever feel unsafe from a sexual predator. Know that you\u2019re not alone and that there are a host of places willing to help you through your trauma.

One of the women, Colbie Holderness, told the Daily Mail that during a vacation in Florence, Italy, Porter became angry and punched her in the face. Holderness included photos of herself with a badly bruised eye. Porter\u2019s second wife, Jennifer Willoughby, said that the emotionally abusive Porter was physically abusive just once during their marriage but added during an interview with CNN that she was genuinely concerned for Hope Hicks\u2019 safety.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s changed,\u201d Willoughby said. \u201cIt definitely worries me because if I\u2019m being frank with you, if he hasn\u2019t already been abusive with Hope, he will. Particularly now that he\u2019s under a lot of stress and scrutiny. That\u2019s when the behaviors come out.\u201d\n\nInstead of laying low on the subject and letting speculation about whether the White House hired Porter fully knowing that he was an abuser die down, what does the president do? You guessed it: He calls reporters into the Oval Office so that he can wish Porter a fond farewell while emphasizing that Porter claimed he was innocent.\n\n\u201cI found out about it recently and I was surprised by it,\u201d Trump said, CNN reports. \u201cWe certainly wish him well. It\u2019s obviously a very tough time for him. He did a very good job while he was in the White House.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDid Trump mention the women who were reportedly beaten?

Porter submitted his resignation Wednesday, but he will still be around the White House because they never wanted him to quit in the first place.

What\u2019s currently prevalent in the pieces responding to Babe\u2019s Ansari story are hyperbole, intellectual dishonesty and red herrings.\n\nIn her response to Babe\u2019s article, \u201cAziz Ansari Is Guilty. Of Not Being a Mind Reader,\u201d the New York Times\u2019 Bari Weiss shrieks, \u201cThe insidious attempts by some women to criminalize awkward, gross, and entitled sex takes women back to the days of smelling salts, and fainting couches.\u201d The Los Angeles Times, unafraid to ask the \u201ctough\u201d questions, pondered, \u201cIs Aziz Ansari a Victim or Perpetrator?\u201d\n\nNot to be outdone in the histrionics competition, The Atlantic published \u201cThe Humiliation of Aziz Ansari,\u201d in which writer Caitlin Flanagan calls Babe\u2019s piece \u201c3,000 words of revenge porn\u201d and eagerly paints \u201cGrace\u201d as a nefarious, resentful, mean girl hell-bent on making Ansari pay for rejecting her, declaring, \u201cTogether, [Grace and Babe writer Katie Way] may have destroyed Ansari\u2019s career.\u201d\n\nIronically, the same parties who stress the necessity of having stringent qualifications for proper claims of sexual assault and victimhood\u2014of which they deem Grace unworthy\u2014have less demanding standards of proof when it comes to bestowing Ansari with their own thorny crowns of victimization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir flimsy concern about \u201cinfantilizing\u201d women is nothing short of laughable as they indulge in their anti-fourth-wave-feminism hysterics and pull a 34-year-old man to their heaving bosoms like vigilant caretakers, rendering him incapable of anything more malignant than simply being a creepy and inattentive sexual partner.\n\nReality is much less fantastical. Babe\u2019s piece, flawed as it may be, did not send society as we know it into a tailspin of anomie. Scores of hapless men who merely attempt conversation or interaction with women who pique their sexual interest are not being apprehended by a feminist gestapo for crimes of rape; nor did it \u201cderail\u201d the #MeToo movement for parties who weren\u2019t already looking for an excuse to dismiss it.\n\nWe do not live in a society where published allegations of sexual assault alone ruin one\u2019s career. If it\u2019s any consolation for the Weisses and Flanagans of the world, they may simply look to the likes of R. Kelly and the current president of the United States for solace in how little such accusations hinder powerful men from thriving.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo date, Ansari\u2014much like most of the celebrities and industry insiders who have recently been accused of assault and misconduct\u2014has not been destroyed by modern-day, bloodthirsty-feminist witch hunts, excommunicated from human civilization or criminalized (pending police investigations into allegations involving Harvey Weinstein and Russell Simmons notwithstanding).\n\n\n\nGrace\u2019s account\u2014one that toggles between acquiescing to certain sexual acts and withdrawing from others\u2014is a pervasive experience. While many seem to direct their ire at Grace for her decisions and at Babe for its treatment of the story, few are expressing resentment toward the societal conditions that demand we present infallible victims with accounts of sexual abuse enshrouded in an impenetrable armor of credibility to even be taken seriously in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s time to be honest: We are a society\u2014a country especially\u2014that despises victims for having the audacity to \u201callow\u201d themselves to be victimized. When Grace describes her reaction to Ansari\u2019s advances\u2014\u201cI stopped moving my lips and went cold\u201d\u2014it was hard for me to imagine that many of us couldn\u2019t relate to that kind of dissociation. When she mentions taking a while to concede to the feeling that she\u2019d been violated, I understood her reluctance to arrive there.\n\n\n\nVictimhood is work. Acknowledging it, vocalizing it, deciding if it merits pressing charges, following through with seeking punitive recourse or any recourse, healing from it, moving on and preparing for the onslaught of interrogation from parties who are more than eager to discredit it\u2014it\u2019s arduous and painful work.\n\nThe choice to \u201cfight back\u201d when you are being pressured or overpowered during sexual interaction makes it all the more real that an assault is happening and could escalate, and the consequential stigma of victimhood all the more imminent. It\u2019s no wonder so many people resent it and try to deny their own proximity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFew sins are worse in America than being powerless. Many of us, especially those of us who may have already cobbled ourselves together after recovering from prior experiences with assault, would rather dissociate and delude ourselves into believing that our own experiences with sexual coercion were just \u201caggressive\u201d or \u201cawkward\u201d instances that we gave into\u2014to avoid having to add another instance of sexual assault to an already loaded plate of trauma.\n\nThe takeaway from Grace\u2019s anecdote isn\u2019t that we should consider every regrettable or uncomfortable sexual interaction as assault (though this anecdote described more than mere discomfort; remember, sexual assault encompasses more than rape). This isn\u2019t about bad sex. It\u2019s about examining how dysfunctional our sexual socialization is for us to read that instance and chalk it up to merely being a \u201cnormal\u201d and clumsy sexual experience. There should be nothing \u201cnormal\u201d about leaving a date in tears because you feel violated, and we shouldn\u2019t be so content and flippant with characterizing it as such.\n\n\n\nUltimately, this is an incident in which many truths can exist; we can acknowledge that it\u2019s probable Ansari\u2019s celebrity and his public persona played a part in Grace wanting to give Ansari a chance to redeem himself during that evening, and even desiring his kindness after he made her uncomfortable. It\u2019s just as probable that Ansari was fully aware of the leverage his celebrity granted him over a green young woman 10 years his junior who was visibly eager to go out on a date with a popular star.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also very likely that a man who has written a book about modern dating in which he elaborates on his habit of determining if a woman is uninterested in him simply by the tone and response time of her text messages is capable of gauging that a woman who recoils from his attempts of getting her to touch his dick for 30 minutes and verbally expresses that she doesn\u2019t \u201cwant to feel forced\u201d is probably not excited about having sex with him, and consent is not static.\n\nFurthermore, claims that men in general are unable to read nonverbal cues and that anything other than a clear \u201cno\u201d confuses them have been debunked in recent studies; researchers conclude (pdf) that men are, in fact, perfectly capable of reading and recognizing nonverbal cues from women who are resistant to sex. The problem isn\u2019t that they don\u2019t understand; they just don\u2019t like the answer.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s OK to feel unsure if what Grace described as the worst night of her life neatly matches with your understanding of assault. That discussion needs to be had if we are to have a rigorous examination of our sexual politics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, accusations of sexual abuse are not all going to look like scandalous, easy-to-condemn, jaw-dropping accounts of egregious brutality and predation, and alleged victims are not always going to behave in ways we understand. Nor should they have to for us to engage them responsibly.\n\nDisingenuous, lazy claims about the \u201cambiguity\u201d of both consent and resistance allow sexual assault to remain ubiquitous. If nothing else, we are a society that firmly believes in questioning the credibility of alleged victims with way more fervor than we do the actions of their alleged abusers.\n\nWe have ample leg room to, instead, fix our gaze on proper ways to handle the stories and best interest of people alleging sexual assault. We can also stand to focus a harsher lens on men like Ansari who pursue rigid sexual compliance in the face of resistance and to admonish their team of toxic acolytes who are more than eager to dismiss their harmfulness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we are to push forward conversations about sexual abuse and all of its variations, we need to be prepared to be uncomfortable, unsure and conflicted. It\u2019s not a precursor to anarchy or a disservice to the movement if we question what we have accepted to be normal and entertain the possibility that we have been harmed or may have also caused harm during the course of our sexual experiences.\n\nRest assured, we have not strayed that far from the status quo.

I openly hate the president, and I don\u2019t hate much except avocados, most white policemen and Trump, so I wanted her stories of salacious cheating to be true.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut now I\u2019m not so sure. Last night, after the president\u2019s inaugural State of the Union, Daniels, whose real name is who gives a shit, appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and basically said a bunch of nothing.\n\nEarlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Daniels had been paid $130,000 to keep the affair between the sheets. The reported payment was made by Trump\u2019s attorney. On Tuesday, just one day before Daniels was to appear on Kimmel, she released a letter denying all of the reported allegations. This, of course, is after Daniels had booked the appearance on the show, and it was too late for Kimmel to find someone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this also comes after Daniels announced that she was going on a \u201cMake America Horny Again\u201d strip-athon around roadside strip joints.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop Kimmel from trying to hit Daniels with the hard questions. He asked her why the signatures on her denial letter didn\u2019t match up with the signature found on her autographs. Kimmel then asked if she signed the denial letter, to which Daniels evasively replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know, did I? Doesn\u2019t look like my signature, does it?\u201d\n\nKimmel then asked if she knew where the letter came from and if she had authorized its release.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI do not,\u201d she said. \u201cIt came from the internet.\u201d\n\nNice. Sounds like someone is trying to milk her 15 minutes of nasty fame by teasing the idea that she is actually having 15 minutes of reputable fame.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKimmel then told Daniels that if she didn\u2019t have a nondisclosure agreement with the president, she could flat out say that she didn\u2019t have one.\n\nTo which Daniels laughed and responded, \u201cYou\u2019re so smart, Jimmy.\u201d\n\n\n\nSeriously, at this point, I would\u2019ve been fine with Kimmel kicking her off his show.

At the time, he was 22; his victim, Jules Woodson, was 17.\n\nOn Thursday night, Highpoint Church\u2019s lead pastor, Chris Conlee, announced in a statement that the church had issued Savage a leave of absence to begin immediately.\n\nEarlier:\n\nToday we bring you two accounts of pastors accused of sexually assaulting minors\u2014with two very different endings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn one case coming out of Fayetteville, N.C., a former pastor has been charged with 142 charges of child sex crimes, including the rapes of four children. According to WTVD-TV, Glenn Tyrone Collins has been accused of repeatedly sexually abusing children between 1996 and 2009.\n\nThe TV outlet notes that one of the alleged victims was Collins\u2019 neighbor. But a look at the charges against Collins\u2014namely, 39 counts of sexual activity by a parent\u2014indicates that Collins is also accused of abusing one or more of his own children or, at the very least, someone for whom he was the primary guardian.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice say that they picked up the case after one of Collins\u2019 accusers came forward, describing the alleged abuse as years of emotional torture, according to WTVD-TV. Collins turned himself in to police on Monday after a warrant was issued for his arrest.\n\nAt a bond hearing, Collins pleaded with a judge for his release, defended his reputation as a pillar in the community and told the court that he wasn\u2019t \u201cguilty of this stuff.\u201d\n\nAs of Tuesday, the former pastor was being held at the Cumberland County Jail on a $3.75 million bond.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs North Carolina police were securing warrants against Collins, in Memphis, Tenn., a pastor of a megachurch there received a standing ovation from his congregation Sunday after admitting to his abuse of a child.\n\nAndy Savage admitted to his flock that he had engaged in a \u201csexual incident\u201d with a teenage girl he drove home from church 20 years ago. He was a youth minister at a church in suburban Houston at the time.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the New York Times:\n\n[Savage] did not tell the congregation at Highpoint Church what took place in 1998, but he said that he had sinned, taken responsibility for it and never kept it a secret from church leaders. He said that before [his accuser] took her story public, he believed that the episode had been \u201cdealt with in Texas.\u201d \u201cUntil now, I did not know there was unfinished business with Jules,\u201d Mr. Savage, 42, said during the service, which was streamed live online. \u201cJules, I am deeply sorry for my actions 20 years ago. I remain committed to cooperate with you toward forgiveness and healing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, Savage didn\u2019t come forward with his \u201csin\u201d of his own volition. His accuser, Jules Woodson, went public just days before, writing a blog post that detailed his assault against her.\n\nIn the blog, which highlights sexual abuse within the church, Woodson says that Savage offered to take her home from church, where she had gone after school. Instead of dropping her off at her house, though, Savage drove past to a secluded area and had Woodson perform oral sex on him. Later, she says, Savage got out of the car and went to her passenger-side door, getting on his knees and begging her not to tell anyone what happened.\n\nAccording to Woodson, the man of Gold told her, \u201cYou can\u2019t tell anyone, Jules, please. You have to take this to the grave with you.\u201d She was 17 years old at the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWoodson says that she reached out to Savage following news of Matt Lauer\u2019s firing from NBC for sexual abuse, asking him in an email if he remembered that night, and the sexual assault that took place.\n\nSavage never responded to her. After a month of no reply, reports the Times, Woodson decided that it was time to go public with her story.\n\nWoodson also told the Times that she had reported the incident to an associate pastor at the church back in \u201998. Instead of reporting the incident to authorities, Woodson says that Larry Cotton, a pastor at Woodlands Parkway Baptist Church, advised her to stay quiet and said that the church would address the issue itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the Times:\n\nAfter Ms. Woodson told Mr. Cotton about her story in 1998, she said the church sent Mr. Savage to apologize to her mother. But he never told her mother explicitly what had happened, leaving the impression that they had only kissed. In Sunday\u2019s service, Mr. Savage said that at the time he handled the situation in a \u201cbiblical way\u201d and resigned from the church and returned to his hometown, Memphis.\ufeff\n\nWhere, as we know, Savage simply went on to another church.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d like to know specifically what \u201cbiblical way\u201d Savage took to address this situation. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t wandering in the desert for 40 years. And I must have missed the part in the Bible where a man of God takes advantage of a teenage girl, gets called out on his behavior and then just bounces to another, bigger church where he receives a 20-second standing ovation for admitting he abused his power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe that\u2019s in Deuteronomy, or maybe Jesus only wanted teenage girls in dark, secluded places to touch the hem of his garment.\n\nEither way, Highpoint Church says it\u2019s standing by its man.\n\nRead more at WTDV-TV and the New York Times.", "keywords": ["jules", "pastor", "sexual", "sexually", "mr", "collins", "admitted", "leave", "savage", "teen", "church", "told", "took", "woodson", "assaulting"], "polarity": 0.09166528925619834, "subjectivity": 0.44981031090121987},

In 2010 she became the youngest governor in America at age 43, and she credited Hillary Clinton for her foray into politics.

Maybe she drank the Kool-Aid while enjoying the rotten ends of a Trump steak. Maybe she got drunk off power. Nevertheless, Haley, who was always a member of the dark side, aka the Republican Party, has gone fully into the darkness as the United Nations ambassador and possible side chick to the president.\n\n\n\nAs such, Haley seems to have lost her way and her funny bone, since she didn\u2019t seem to take too kindly to Sunday night\u2019s Grammy segment that had Clinton, Cardi B and Snoop Dogg reading bits of the controversial book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have always loved the Grammys but to have artists read the Fire and Fury book killed it,\u201d Haley tweeted on Sunday night, The Hill reports. \u201cDon\u2019t ruin great music with trash.

He\u2019s turned his White House into the location of a horrible reality show. He\u2019s turned Twitter into a weapon of mass destruction. He\u2019s made the United States the most hated country on the planet (again).\n\nNow he\u2019s managed to turn the legislative budgeting process into a ridiculous hostage-taking action movie, complete with colorful henchmen and elaborate traps.\n\n\n\nOn Friday, at midnight, the federal government will go dark because Republicans can\u2019t figure out how to pay their bills. In a fair, rational world, Republicans would admit that it\u2019s their own party\u2019s inability to realize that 2 plus 2 does not equal \u201cMake America great again\u201d that caused this problem in the first place. However, we\u2019re not in a rational world anymore. We\u2019re in a world where accused pedophiles quote Jesus and run for office, a man who calls protesting black NFL players sons of bitches and quotes Martin Luther King Jr., and Cardi B has more top 10 hits than Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nThe Republicans want to hold 850,000 government employees, 800,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals-program recipients and 9 million kids in the Child Health Insurance Program hostage until their demands are met. They insist that the Democratic Party must vote yes on a new budget that funds the government only until Feb. 16, ignores DACA and shortchanges CHIP. The only way the GOP will even touch DACA is if the bill includes funding for Trump\u2019s \u201cwhite nationalist climbing wall\u201d\u2014otherwise the government fails and the kids get nothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m convinced that the Democrats\u2014who, up until now, have shown the negotiating skills of a drunk frat boy in Tijuana\u2014must\u2019ve watched a TNT marathon of Olympus Has Fallen or sought the hostage-negotiating counsel of Denzel Washington. (Seriously, next to Jesse Jackson, what black man has saved more people in distress? From that early scene in Ricochet to Man on Fire, John Q and Inside Man\u2014hell, he killed Stringer Bell\u2014I\u2019m pretty sure Denzel could balance the budget, fix immigration and disarm North Korea in 90 minutes. My man!) Either way, Democrats will have to figure out how to stand up to the Republicans\u2019 demands. The only question now is, Who. Blinks. First?\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s important to point out how we got to this standoff on top of a windswept mountain, with both parties giving speeches about what they not gon\u2019 do. Basically, the Republican Party doesn\u2019t know how to govern. Even though Republicans run everything in Washington, D.C.\u2014the presidency, the House of Representatives, the Senate, the Supreme Court, the kiosk in Union Station, the Panera in the Capitol Cafeteria\u2014they can\u2019t even get their own party to agree on a long-term budget for government funding.\n\nThe DACA program was ended by Trump, creating a conflict where there was none. The CHIP program expired under GOP leadership; they could fix it in one vote, but they won\u2019t. Since Republicans can\u2019t get their own house in order, they\u2019ll grab CHIP and DACA at gunpoint, hoping to force the Democrats to make up for votes they can\u2019t sway in their own party.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem is, many Republicans and Democrats are tired of voting for short-term budgets because it wreaks havoc on federal agencies. It\u2019s hard to plan for disaster relief when your credit card might stop working every six weeks. When the last continuing resolution was passed in the House and the Senate in late December, Republicans were mad that it didn\u2019t give more money to the military. Democrats were angry that it didn\u2019t provide a solution for the 800,000 DACA recipients, and members of Congress who actually have fully beating hearts and functional souls were unhappy that 9 million kids might go without CHIP funding in the coming decade.\n\nOn Thursday, Republicans in the House managed to pass a short-term spending bill, but passing it in the Senate is another matter. In order to reach the 60 votes needed, every Republican has to vote for the funding bill and about 11 Democrats have to switch sides. Democrats have been screaming \u201cRelease the hostages\u201d\u2014aka calling for a clean DACA bill and CHIP funding\u2014for months now. And Republicans have responded by cocking the trigger: Drop DACA, accept less funding for CHIP, pay for the border wall, give us all your Netflix and Amazon.com passwords, and we\u2019ll have a deal. (The Dems only agreed to the last one.)\n\nI\u2019d like to give credit to Democrats for being principled and holding their ground for kids, but this situation is also because of GOP incompetence. The reason Democrats aren\u2019t folding like MacBooks is that Republicans are lousy hostage takers. They\u2019re like those Somali pirates in Captain Phillips. You aren\u2019t really in charge if you can\u2019t drive the boat, and Republicans can\u2019t even find the steering wheel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nDespite numerical majorities in both houses of Congress, the Republicans only look like they\u2019re in control of the situation. First, Democrats know that even if they voted for a continuing resolution, Republicans would find some way to gut CHIP down the road in a future budget. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, the negotiators, also know that President \u201cShithole\u201d is not about to let 800,000 Hispanic kids stay in America; he ended DACA because he is a white nationalist and doesn\u2019t want those kids in America.\n\nIf Trump actually wanted a policy solution with \u201clove,\u201d he could simply reinstate DACA and work with Congress on a solution. But he won\u2019t because he doesn\u2019t care. When the government shuts down (and it looks all but assured at this point), the party that runs everything in the country is going to get blamed, not the Democrats.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost good movie negotiators figure out the obvious: The hostages are dead anyway. There\u2019s no reason to negotiate. No one will blame you if the serial killer blows up the building and everybody inside because anyone who\u2019s watching knows that you\u2019re dealing with a crazy person.

Nevertheless, I am going to talk to you even though I fear you vacated your body a long time ago. I believe you sent yourself away where no one could touch you. You went crazy first and now you exist in parts. You, dear Ben, are a man who once was. But being a woman of hope, I ask: can you walk a ways and see where your heart is? I imagine it used to beat with such vigor and passion, a magic heart.\n\nI believe you are dying a slow death in the shell of your skin, because what else could bring you to say enslaved human beings who were stacked atop each other with no room to move or breathe or relieve themselves, who were starved and whipped and raped, who were ripped from their husbands and wives and from their children\u2014many of whom died during the treacherous journey, their bones their only song now at the bottom of dead seas made holy now by their gleam\u2014were immigrants? They were enslaved, Ben. They were worked, often, to death, for nothing. That\u2019s call slavery, Ben. It went on for four centuries. Ben, did you know they were in chains? Ben, what immigrants be in chains? Ben, you sound so stupid, but unfortunately, you are not merely stupid. If you were merely stupid, this would not cause us such outrage. Ben, we knew a while ago that you had become\u2026different. Conservative. Ignorant. Bigoted. You didn\u2019t look or talk like the Ben who was once ours\u2014the way the Temptations are ours, the way Barack and Michelle are ours, the way Anita Baker is ours, the way Maxine Waters is ours, the way gospel and the blues are ours. But we weren\u2019t enough for you. Our love wasn\u2019t good enough for you, and neither was self-love. Even the best Uncle Toms can be said to have been bought. Oh, Ben. I do not believe anyone bought your soul; I believe you just gave it away. And you can\u2019t stand yourself no more. I might\u2019ve felt bad enough to weep for you, except you chose this.\n\nI don\u2019t know where your hands have been, even though I know what they used to be: beautiful, brilliant hands, soft as an angel\u2019s wing, doing God\u2019s mighty work. Ben, you think you doing God\u2019s work now? You ain\u2019t. No one loves you enough to tell you because everyone in your circle is still clinging to the Ben Carson you used to be in hopes that, maybe, you could return. But I sense no one is holding their breath on that. Your new, white friends must love all that you have become: a lonesome shell that is either silent or, when he speaks, deadly.\n\nThough I believe you are gone, gone, gone, I got to at least tell you about yourself. Ben, how many Black boys and girls wanted to be doctors and surgeons because of you? But look what you did yesterday: you made racist white people\u2014and even non-racist white people\u2014get off for slavery. Yeah, you did that. I know it can\u2019t sting you just right because you deadened yourself a while back. Nevertheless. You made them believe we wanted that torture and terror. Ben, do you realize you made them believe it was okay to steal us from our first homes? That somehow, slavery was part of our striving? Ben, do you know you told them we wanted that? That we believe it was all worth it for the American Dream, which for many of us, remains a trick? Ben, your hands dirty. They ain\u2019t just dirty, though, Ben. Your hands bloody. Your hands bloody with Black blood. You put bodies on those ships yesterday. You put chains on little children. You said \u201cimmigrants\u201d as if we chose. As if that could even be possible. If you were only stupid, Ben. But no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s sad that you have chosen to be comatose because they were jealous and couldn\u2019t take your Black genius, how you understood the brain\u2014back then\u2014 the way Morrison understands language or the way Miles knew his horn. Ben, you are probably struggling with whom I mean when I say they. I mean white people. I see you shaking your head at that Ben, but they were lesser than you because they couldn\u2019t stand all the genius you were. They hated the way your mind outmaneuvered theirs. Oh, Ben. I can only imagine the landmines of micro and macro aggressions you withstood, on the regular. You were a beautiful brown tree, and they were a hurricane. A fist formed to pound you. I can only imagine the word \u201cnigger\u201d on repeat and all the countless, creative ways they called you that, day in and day out. After all, their greatest creativity is their brutality. The more creative your genius became, the more they reviled you. The more rootless you felt. You let it sink into the bone, how much they hated you. You let them wear you out. Their whiteness haunted you. Their whiteness said you ain\u2019t shit, and you believed them because you wanted their love.\n\nWhy was our love not enough? Did we not hold you up? Did we not whisper your name at Sunday dinners? Did we not pray for God to keep working through your hands? Did we not know your name like we know Dr. King\u2019s? Oh, Ben. Our love is the best love, baby. It\u2019s a shame you couldn\u2019t know that when it mattered, back when your soul was in its place, back when your heart beat on time. Your hands used to do magic work. Oh, Lord, your beautiful hands! Now they don\u2019t have no witness to speak of. They just fold in your lap. I can almost hear them: Well, Lord. We tried.\n\nBen\u2026what happened to Ben Carson?\n\nI know he gone. But do you know where you put him? Did you drown him where they drowned Emmett? Was he shot in his driveway like Medgar? Was he bombed on Christmas Eve? Did you lock him in a cell and throw away the key? Did you cut out his tongue when you took away his heart and his soul? Can you count the lives you touched? Then broke? Does Ben know that number?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, you don\u2019t even dream anymore.\n\nBen, I have always believed Baby Suggs, holy, of Morrison\u2019s Beloved when she said, \u201cThere is no bad luck in the world but whitefolks. They don\u2019t know when to stop.\u201d Then she died. I thought that was the end-all. But you have bested even her. There ain\u2019t no bad luck in the world, I offer as revision, but a Black man who hates himself. Because that man can do no good. All he can do is make the folks who once loved him wonder if it was a phantom all that time. You made the descendants of the so-called masters feel like they were doing us a favor. Four hundred years of \u201cgood looking out.\u201d Oh, Ben. How you disappoint.\n\nYou need to know you should stop talking. I believe silence is golden right now while you go out there and find your real tongue\u2014the tongue that used to raise people from what would have been a certain death without first your tongue declaring what you were about to do, then your hands doing that magic on operating tables. Lord, how you used to shine in that operating room. How you used to shine everywhere. Don\u2019t you miss your shine? Do you remember how it felt to glow? Naw. I don\u2019t imagine you do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBen, I can\u2019t stand you no more or the sound of your voice. I remember who you were, though. Part of why we\u2019re out here dragging you for life is not just because you deserve it, but because your mouth is an open wound, and you hurt us with your lies yesterday. We bear the memory of what you used to mean to us. Once, I would have loved to introduce my son to you. That time has passed. I\u2019d believe you might have a chance to come back if it wasn\u2019t for your eyes. They are such lifeless, dead things.\n\nYou still got breath, from what it looks like. You have to have breath to be talking, even though you should stop. Can you use your breath as a starting point? I\u2019d hoped you might\u2019ve left your soul someplace where you can go back for it. But yesterday, you snatched pretty much all hope of that. Still and all. I write to you. Maybe something inside of you is still alive. You owe us an apology, you sad, sad shell of what used to be a man worthy of our esteem, our respect, our devotion, and our love. Now, all we got for you is shade. And scorch. Even if you uttered sorry, all we would hear is lifeless noise. So. Keep it.\n\nBut this:\n\nBen, put your eyes back in. See what you did to yourself. Amidst a sea of brown love that washed over you, back then, as a prayer, you waded out into deep water and went under. Now you work for a spoiled, hateful, incompetent soul. You salute to him. Those splinters in your feet are from the pedestal we put you on, that you shattered. Oh. How you bleed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI leave you, bewildered but not surprised.\n\nTameka Cage Conley, PhD is a literary artist who writes poetry, fiction, plays, and essays.

Barring a miraculous influx of cash from an itchy pocketed donor with literally no one else to give money to (in which case, I would like to point them toward my IRS bill because the Feds are absolutely not playing with me this year), we are more than likely in the sunset era of Ben Carson's run for President.\n\nBefore we bid the man\u2019s campaign a formal adieu, I would like to take some time to appreciate all that the fellow has contributed to the clusterfuck that has been this year\u2019s primary race. Even if it did come at the expense of damn near every single Black mama who kept a copy of Gifted Hands on their kids\u2019 bookshelves.\n\nIf Benjamin did nothing else this year, its expose once and for all that being one of the foremost experts at one thing makes you little more than the foremost expert at that one thing. Unfortunately for Ben (but not unfortunately for myself, for whom the GOP debates had become my personal Wrestlemania), not every possible circumstance that the commander-in-chief will be faced with can be tied to performing complicated neurosurgery on Siamese twins. As a matter of fact, I\u2019d wager that next to no scenarios could be tied to neurosurgery, unless the White House turns into a real life version of Olympus Has Fallen and the President is running around tending to open head wounds. That said, I respect Ben for not ever failing to mention that he separated Siamese twins ever \u2014 one time I finessed a Metrocard that had 20 extra bucks in it and I may or may not have brought it up in conversation for the better part of a month, so I understand. So what makes Ben Carson qualified to discuss Foreign Policy? Domestic Terrorism? Immigration? Economy? #TheseHands have qualified him, that\u2019s what.\n\nBen\u2019s willingness to apply barbershop logic to almost every turn in this primary race cannot go without mention. There were the ridiculous claims to his steel reserve at gunpoint (at a Popeyes no less). Hotepian arguments that Planned Parenthood exists in Black communities as a form of population control. Long-winded and misguided metaphors about fruit salads and #thesehands - the latter of which is sure to somehow end up as a corny Fabulous punchline, because that is all that Fabulous does these days, so please stop trying to convince the world that his next mixtape is going to be good, Fab fan, all 32 of you.

I don\u2019t know if the fake-news-media thing was supposed to be lighthearted or what, but late Wednesday night, after several outlets posted that the president was full of crap for announcing that the awards would be coming and then not producing, a seemingly rushed list was ushered onto the GOP\u2019s website, which immediately crashed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s as if the website didn\u2019t even want any parts of this dumbass idea. Once the site was functioning, the winners included all the big names that Trump has openly opposed: the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, blah, blah, blah.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe issue with the New York Times piece cited is that it was a column claiming that the economy would suffer under a Trump presidency\u2014which isn\u2019t fake news because we still don\u2019t know what will happen, and Trump keeps claiming victory for the economic legacy that former President Barack Obama left behind. Assuming that Trump\u2019s plan for utter destruction did somehow boost the economy, the column still wouldn\u2019t be fake news; it would merely be an incorrect prediction, since it was written in 2016, before the president was even in office.\n\nThe Fake News Awards were always going to be a sham. In early January, the president claimed that there would be some kind of event and maybe even trophies!\n\n\n\n\u201cI certainly don\u2019t want to spoil anything,\u201d Sarah Huckabee Sanders, aka Suckabee, said during a press briefing on Jan. 3, the Washington Post reports. \u201cBut my guess is that there are quite a few individuals that could be up for those awards. ... We\u2019ll certainly keep you posted. It might be hard for him to present trophies if you guys aren\u2019t there. But I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll have to wait and see what happens.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump continually teased the idea of specific categories in the Fake News Awards\u2014a task that should have proved easy, considering that he tweeted about \u201cfake news\u201d some 150 times, according to the Post. But the Fake News Awards, much like this administration so far, proved to be a whole lot of talk and very little action. Basically, the Fake News Awards were just more fake news from a president who knows more about being fake than anyone else.\n\nRead more at GOP.com and the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["washington", "winners", "couldnt", "right", "know", "trump", "president", "times", "post", "fake", "dont", "awards"], "polarity": -0.08126225987554113, "subjectivity": 0.5560200216450217},

Nudity doesn\u2019t have to be sexual.\u2019 If we asked questions or hesitated, we were the ones making it weird,\u201d Kim added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe women said that once they were lured into the hot tub, Vereen asked them personal questions.\n\n\u201cHe was acting as my mentor, asking me about my parents; then that same night, he put me on his lap while I was crying, and I felt his erection,\u201d Terpstra recalled.\n\n\u201cHe asked me, \u2018Feel that?\u2019 It was terrifying. I said, \u2018Feel what?\u2019 I wanted to act like I didn\u2019t. I pushed myself off with a laugh. Then later, he asked, \u2018Do you think I want to fuck you?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yes,\u2019 and he got angry. He said, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t, and that\u2019s unfortunate.\u2019 He made me feel like I had my mind in the gutter.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKim said that while she was in the hot tub with Vereen, things went even further after he asked her to perform oral sex and left her feeling \u201cconfused.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just think at the time, I didn\u2019t feel like I had a choice. I didn\u2019t want to do it, but I was intimidated and scared. He was being very intense and angry. He seemed very angry and offended. I had seen him behave this way toward others in the tribe during circle,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI just felt powerless because I thought I really needed his help and guidance. And when he said nudity doesn\u2019t have to be sexual, I was like, \u2018OK, maybe this isn\u2019t even sexual,\u2019\u201d Kim added. \u201cNow I understand it was a power play. It was so calculated. It was like we were putty in his hands.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Daily News notes:\n\nIn his statement, Vereen said he gained new perspective on his behavior in the last two years. \u201cWhile it was my intention to create an environment that replicated the themes of that musical during the rehearsal process, I have since come to understand that it is my conduct, not my intentions, which are relevant here. So I am not going to make any excuses because the only thing that matters here is acknowledging and apologizing for the effects of my conduct on the lives of these women,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing forward, my having come to terms with my past conduct will inform all my future interactions not only with women, but with all individuals. I hope these women will find it in their hearts to accept my sincere apology and forgive me,\u201d his statement read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKim acknowledged that she eventually became involved in a relationship with Vereen, saying that she told herself it was more spiritual than sexual.\n\nAnother actress, Ariella Pizarro, accused Vereen of pressing himself against her one night as he hugged her goodbye, before later texting her, \u201cYo (sic) felt so good tonight.\u201d\n\nFrom the Daily News:\n\nThe News obtained a copy of the text message sent by Vereen and confirmed the number was listed in his name. Pizarro said Vereen also randomly kissed her on the lips in the first few weeks of rehearsals, when she was 22 years old. \u201cWe were in a music rehearsal, and he was just walking around, and then he walked up and kissed me on the lips. It was so weird. We all knew Hair was going to be a different kind of production, like in the \u201960s, but he didn\u2019t even ask first. He just kissed me. I was shocked, for sure,\u201d Pizarro said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t shove his tongue down my throat, but it gave me an uneasy feeling. Then he moved on. I didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom that point on, I kept myself at arm\u2019s length with Ben.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCast members also recalled an uncomfortable moment when they had to strip for a rehearsal exercise and Vereen decided he would get naked, too.\n\n\u201cIt was uncomfortable, to say the least,\u201d Pizarro noted.\n\nAs for Venice Theatre, which was supposed to be watching out for these young women, officials said they only became fully aware of the extent of the allegations after Terpstra posted on Facebook about the experience back in November.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe theater reached out to every member of the Hair cast, getting in contact with all but six of the 32 individuals.\n\n\u201cWe have learned recently that during our 2015 production of Hair, more than one female cast member was asked to join Mr. Vereen at his residence. Some of those visits resulted in compromising situations for at least two of the actresses,\u201d Executive Director Murray Chase said in a statement. \u201cWe are working to strengthen our sexual harassment policies and procedures, including the reporting of them, to prevent any future occurrences.\u201d\n\nThat being said, Terpstra said that Chase had to step in during one particularly volatile confrontation with Vereen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Daily News reports:\n\nTerpstra said she\u2019s not sure exactly what she told [Chase], but she thinks she mentioned at least one forced kiss. She said Chase later sat in on the final dress rehearsal, but Vereen was not banned from the building. Chase told the News he remembered the hallway incident but thought it was isolated. \u201cWhile we were aware of an altercation between Ben Vereen and Ms. Terpstra, we have now learned of additional situations,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth Terpstra and Kim said that the experience with Vereen had lasting effects on their careers, with neither having acted in a production since, although both have stayed in the creative fields, with Terpstra going toward burlesque, while Kim returned to a job at the Venice Theatre to \u201credefine that space.\u201d", "keywords": ["hair", "ben", "didnt", "asked", "sexual", "sexually", "feel", "star", "women", "daily", "broadway", "young", "terpstra", "vereen", "actresses", "production", "assaulting"], "polarity": 0.029034894398530763, "subjectivity": 0.4628856749311295},

But let\u2019s be real: U.S. media has long treated black and brown countries like \u2018shitholes.\u2019 This TV-loving president is a product of a media culture that has systemically covered places in Africa and places like Haiti only as war-ravaged, disease-ridden and impoverished \u2014 when these countries are even deemed worthy of coverage at all.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cStudies show headlines from major Western media outlets are largely negative when it comes to Africa.

Western media and literature are riddled with cliche-white savior journalism . That helps to explain why Louise Linton, the now-wife of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, was able to publish an article in the Telegraph (which was later removed from its website) based on her cliche-addled, self-published memoir about her gap year in Zambia. She wrote in the book that Africa is rife with hidden dangers: \u2018I witnessed random acts of violence, contracted malaria and had close encounters with lions, elephants, crocodiles and snakes.\u2019\n\n\u201cNever mind that lazy \u2018Ooga-Booga\u2019 journalism (as journalist Howard French calls [it]) fails to reckon with the fact that African countries are home to some of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Never mind that long before mobile money-sharing systems such as Venmo came to the United States, countries like Kenya were using mobile platforms including M-Pesa. Never mind that African countries are beginning to produce their own cars, embrace biometric technology and venture into space exploration.

French, former Africa correspondent for the New York Times, wrote Sunday for the Washington Post.\n\n\n\n\u201cI see this as an opportunity to challenge the American public to confront this reality: More than any other factor, it is the wealth derived from Africa, especially the labor of people taken in chains from that continent, that accounts for the rise of the West and its centuries of predominance in world affairs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe facts of this history hide in plain sight, and yet Americans and others in the West have averted their eyes for 500 years. The West\u2019s ascension over other parts of the world has been attributed, instead, to innate Western qualities, including rationality and a talent for invention and innovation, or Western institutions. It is this distortion of reality \u2014 a delusion, really \u2014 that fuels attitudes of white superiority, whether subtle and pervasive, or as crude as those exhibited by someone like Trump.\n\n\u201cIn reality, the West\u2019s takeoff, beginning at the end of the 15th century, was founded on its proximity both to Africa and to what we now call the Caribbean and Latin America \u2014 the very regions that Trump has slandered. In time, the West would display a ruthless will to plunder the these regions, robbing them of their human and natural resources. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n. . . \u2018Not Just Racist, but Inaccurate\u2019\n\nCommentators of color on the Sunday talk shows rose to the defense of black and brown countries, in some cases because that is where they were born.\n\nOn CNN\u2019s \u201cReliable Sources\u201d Sunday, Tennessee-born Van Jones, the activist and CNN commentator, defended African immigrants by citing numbers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPart of I think what is important to keep in mind,\u201d Jones said of President Trump\u2019s comment, \u201cnot only were those comments racist, they are also just inaccurate. When you have 30 percent of Americans have college degrees, 43 percent of African immigrants have college degrees, 10 percent of white Americans have advanced degrees, 25 percent of Nigerian-Americans have advanced degrees.\n\n\u201cSo, he\u2019s just dealing with a stereotype from his childhood that has no relationship or little relationship with what\u2019s going on right now. And I think what I\u2019m proud of is that the media just called it like it is. If he said \u2014 listen, I only want skills-based people, I only want engineers if they are from Nigeria, if they\u2019re from Norway, I only want engineers. That\u2019s not racist.\n\n\u201cBut when you say the whole country is not welcomed, that is the definition, textbook, of racism. And I\u2019m glad that the media just called him on that. He wasn\u2019t saying, I want skills-based people no matter what color. He said, I want people from this country no matter \u2014 in Norway, no matter how unqualified, and I don\u2019t want anybody from these countries no matter how qualified. That\u2019s the definition of racism. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a discussion of whether media should repeat the word \u201cshithole,\u201d Jones said, \u201cwhat the other thing journalists have to do, though, is to go even deeper and to point out a couple of things. It\u2019s not just African countries are all basket cases and all the African immigrants are just here pulling America down, we just shouldn\u2019t use the word \u2018shithole\u2019.\n\n\u201cThat \u2014 it was not about making the stereotypes a little bit more palatable. It\u2019s about pointing out that African immigrants are coming here in neighborhoods from Oakland to the Bronx, bringing down the crime rate, bringing up the learning rate, bringing up the entrepreneurship and making America great \u2014 same with Haitians and same with El Salvadorians.\n\n\u201cIn other words, this idea that \u2014 well, maybe they really are shithole places, you just shouldn\u2019t say it, and maybe the people who are coming here are not be worthy to be here, that also needs to be challenged based on facts. The educational attainment for African immigrants exceeds the educational attainment for European immigrants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNobody was aware of that.\n\n\u201cSo, if you want to have the conversation about what\u2019s going to make America great again, let\u2019s have it.\n\n\u201cOne last point I have to make, if you close the door to immigration as severely as Trump wants to, shut it down, you know who gets hurt the most? Trump\u2019s older, white retiring voters who are going to then be living in a country where we\u2019ll be like Japan. We don\u2019t have enough young people in America. We\u2019re going to have a bunch of older people in America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe need immigration to keep the economy going, so that their retirements can be secure. So, it\u2019s not just racist. It\u2019s not just counter factually. It\u2019s also politically stupid to keep out the younger part of the world that wants to come here and make our economy work.\n\n\u201cThis is just dumb and wrong and racist across the board. Let\u2019s have that conversation, and not only have the conservation about the vulgarism. The vulgarism is just the additional harm to the country.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Helene Cooper, born in Liberia and now a Pentagon correspondent for the New York Times, said she took Trump\u2019s comments personally.\n\n\u201cI feel like we\u2019ve crossed the point now as this country when you look at our image abroad, internationally, this country has always been seen as a nation of immigrants,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m one of them coming from Liberia, which I guess would qualify for one of those African countries that President Trump disparaged earlier last week.\n\n\u201cWhat I find really disturbing about this, but just take President Trump aside, because I think this is the sort of thing that we expect from him, but what I find really upsetting about this is that for so many years, I felt like such a proud American. I feel very much like this is my country. But I also feel \u2014 one of the reasons I\u2019ve always felt proud is because this is a country where when my family left Liberia when I was 14 years old, we could have gone anywhere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut I would never have gotten to the point that I got in my life if we had gone somewhere other than the United States. I would never have become a New York Times reporter. It would\u2019ve been a whole lot harder to do what I was able to do here if we had gone to Europe or somewhere like that. And I \u2014 that has always made me proud of this country. That this is a country that you can come to with nothing and you can make something of yourself. And I feel like that \u2014 we\u2019re starting to lose that. And I can\u2019t begin to describe just how upsetting that can be personally, but just how much damage that can do to the United States around the world and how other people look at us.\u201d\n\nOn \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Juan WIlliams, who was born in Panama, was part of that show\u2019s discussion of Trump\u2019s stance in the immigration policy debate.\n\n\u201cAnd in the lottery system, what he clearly said was, why do we need people from these s-hole countries because right now they\u2019re underrepresented,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAnd the reason the lottery exists is to make sure that there\u2019s more adequate representation of people who have not been coming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nModerator Chris Wallace interjected, \u201cAll right, let me \u2014 let me \u2014\u201d\n\nWilliams continued, \u201cAnd he spoke not about the countries when saying that, but about the people who would be included in the lottery.

I am honored to be First Lady of a nation that continually strives for equality & justice for all. # MLKDay,\u201d she wrote on Monday.\n\nYep, just days after her husband\u2014who has been a KFC-greased hot rod for racist commentary\u2014called several black and brown countries shitholes, she tweeted that with the wide-eyed fanaticism of a young Simba before his father\u2019s death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, I\u2019m kidding; Melania\u2019s ass has always been trash, and she knows that her husband ain\u2019t shit.\n\nBut what is actually perplexing about this administration, its supporters and the talking heads on Fake News Fox News is that its members quadruple down on their racism, only to try to act as if they aren\u2019t, in fact, racist. While Donald Trump\u2019s lazy ass was golfing, the White House issued a statement celebrating Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s legacy: \u201cDr. King\u2019s dream is our dream. It is the American Dream. It\u2019s the promise stitched into the fabric of our Nation, etched into the hearts of our people, and written into the soul of humankind.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe president also said of King\u2019s dream, Newsweek reports: \u201cIt is the dream of a world where people are judged by who they are, not how they look or where they come from. It is the dream of a nation that offers a life of dignity and hope to every American regardless or color or creed.\u201d\n\nWhy even send the tweet or issue a statement in the first place, when everything coming out of this administration has been contradictory? You don\u2019t care about King\u2019s service to this country, especially considering that the previous president, who has been a disciple of King\u2019s legacy, has served as Donald Trump\u2019s template for what not to do. Donald has spent his first year in office undoing Barack Obama\u2019s legacy, while casually emboldening white supremacy and white nationalism.\n\n\n\nMelania married the man, so she gets no slack. She knew who he was before he took office, and I know it\u2019s early in the day, but she\u2019s seen him naked. She\u2019s the woman behind the man who wants to end the world as we know it, and you don\u2019t get to shy away from that now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKing was shot down fighting to end everything that the White House now represents, so I say this with all due respect: Keep the good reverend\u2019s name out of your mouth and off your complicit fingers.\n\nRead more at Newsweek.", "keywords": ["dream", "nation", "melania", "house", "white", "day", "kings", "deplorable", "legacy", "proves", "donald", "husband", "trumps", "mlk", "delusional"], "polarity": 0.02392557651991614, "subjectivity": 0.4216719077568135},

Pence\u2019s snubbing of black people happened on the same day President Donald Trump talked as if Frederick Douglass, abolitionist, writer and civil rights leader, were still alive (he died in 1895). Later in the month, U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos said that HBCUs were \u201cpioneers\u201d of \u201cschool choice\u201d (colleges were segregated).\n\n\n\nIt was a sign of things to come.\n\n\n\nBy Pence\u2019s standard, Trump made black history in his first year as president by waging an assault on voting rights through his now-defunct voting-fraud commission, calling white supremacists \u201cfine people\u201d after the Charlottesville, Va., march and, more recently, disparaging Haiti, El Salvador and African countries as \u201cshithole countries.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe should all be appalled at the administration\u2019s ignorance around race, but we should be not surprised. Racism is taught. And when white history is the standard, when history is told from the point of view of white people, you might well believe, as failed U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore does, that slavery was good for black people.\n\n\n\nThe flagrant ignorance and blatant racism of the Trump administration makes clearer what black celebrities such as Morgan Freeman and Stacey Dash mean (or so we hope) when they say, \u201cI don\u2019t want Black History Month.\u201d It\u2019s obvious that black history is needed all year long. But white history as we know it can no longer be the standard in a multicultural society, which is supposed to maximize the potential of all its members.\n\n\n\nThe late, great historian Carter G. Woodson started Negro History Week in 1926 with hopes that black people would be proud of their heritage and that mainstream America would recognize the contributions of its black residents. While millions of students across the country now study the influences of black people and culture in what has evolved into Black History Month, Trump proves regularly that Woodson\u2019s ultimate goal of integrating black history into our core curricula fell far short of national acceptance.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe danger in relegating black history to a month is that it becomes horribly contained to a month. Ask your child, colleague or friend to say a few brief words about Woodson, sing the first few lines of \u201cthe black national anthem\u201d or identify five African countries during the rest of the months and there\u2019s a strong possibility that you\u2019ll think you\u2019re talking to a version of Trump.\n\nBlack contributions to society are not being recognized in the pantheon of American history. Worse, this lack of recognition is reflected in national policy, racial inequities in compensation and the discounting of black leadership. Unequal pay is a blatant, empirical sign of a devaluation of worth.\n\n\n\nYou obviously can\u2019t blame the devaluation of black people on Black History Month. As a young person, I remember learning about renowned surgeon Ben Carson at a BLM event and how he became the first to successfully separate twins at the head. I listened to Carson with admiration and pride at another such event when he narrated, with great aplomb, the exact stops along the neural pathway from a touch of the finger to the brain and back again. It\u2019s a shtick I would hear many times, with the same reaction.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut when Carson, as U.S. secretary of housing and urban development, referred to slaves as \u201cimmigrants\u201d last year during a departmental junket with employees, he proved that there\u2019s nothing wrong with BLM. Carson, too, could not detach the white-centric history he learned in school from his own brain.\n\n\n\nNo wonder, when he probably also studied those whitewashed stories of Christopher Columbus \u201cdiscovering\u201d America (no matter the millions of Native Americans already living here), which are buttressed by tales of how the Pilgrims supposedly sat down with the Indians for a delightful supper (already part of their harvest tradition).\n\nWhen slavery is covered in history class, the teaching of black benign servitude too often goes along with ideas that the Ku Klux Klan is a Christian organization exhibiting principles like loving thy neighbor. We have statues of Confederate heroes\u2014i.e., racist traitors\u2014littered throughout the U.S., particularly in the South. And of course, Abraham Lincoln didn\u2019t have a racist bone in his body.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe misrepresenting of colonization, slavery and racists is behind the racism and ignorance of Trump and people like him, not Black History Month.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m indebted to the people, places and traditions I\u2019ve been introduced to in February. I have received numerous invitations to speak at BLM events, and I will continue to highlight black accomplishments in my columns during February. Calling for mainstream inclusion isn\u2019t a charge to end BLM. In fact, we can use it to introduce more recent history and fresh faces.\n\n\n\nFor instance, if there is a book by a black author that you must read this month, take in Stamped From the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America, by Ibram X. Kendi, winner of the 2016 National Book Award for nonfiction. Kendi\u2019s book provides a thorough reading of U.S. history from the perspective of black people. He moves Woodson\u2019s legacy forward, along with those of other notable historians who are still alive, such as James D. Anderson, Robin D.G. Kelley, Henry Louis Gates Jr., Blair L.M. Kelley and Paula Giddings. There are people who continue to write outside of white standards, to our collective benefit. But to reap the social fruits of their labor, we must remove the standard of white-centric history.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGetting to a place where we can make history more inclusive is not easy. In fact, it\u2019s a thoroughly radical endeavor that first requires society to acknowledge that history is not an impartial narration of events as they occurred. It is, rather, the story as told by the people who are telling it. Retelling our history requires acknowledging that the American identity is rooted in a false narrative that makes the exhortation to \u201cMake America great again\u201d an oxymoron (for the people who were brought here as slaves, it was never all that great to begin with).\n\n\n\nMany multicultural-education advocates have promoted curricula that expand the perspectives in American history. The pushback to the ethnic-studies and multicultural-education movements is about protecting white history. University faculty have much more leeway as to their text selection, but people of color are severely underrepresented in the full-time teaching ranks. And core undergraduate curriculums are guarded by traditions, professional (read: white) standards and faculty who were trained in accordance with them.\n\n\n\nRemoving racist history books will be harder than shuttling Confederate monuments to the backs of museums. Neither important act is about erasing history\u2014it\u2019s about making it. Woodson wanted to see black history infused into American history because they\u2019re one and the same. But he also wanted the idolatry of whiteness removed from America\u2019s sight.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis story was produced by the Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education, in partnership with The Root.", "keywords": ["history", "national", "month", "black", "cant", "relegated", "white", "trump", "shouldnt", "racist", "standard", "single", "great", "slavery"], "polarity": 0.04301038843721771, "subjectivity": 0.38613803766242794},

Captained by William Foster, the Clotilda unloaded its precious cargo: 110 kidnapped human beings.\n\n\n\nWhen federal authorities discovered that Timothy Meaher, a wealthy Mobile plantation owner, had made a bet with his friends that he could sneak a shipment of slaves into the country, they decided to investigate the crime. To hide their misdeeds, Foster rushed to the Clotilda and set it on fire. The vessel sank to the bottom of the ocean, never to be seen again.\n\nNow AL.com reports that one of its reporters, Ben Raines, may have discovered the last slave ship in American buried in the mud of the lower Mobile-Tensaw Delta. The ship would normally have been covered by the water, but the unusually northern winds from the recent \u201cbomb cyclone\u201d on the Eastern Seaboard reduced the tide in Mobile Bay to 2 1/2 feet below its normal depth, revealing the ship to Raines.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m quaking with excitement. This would be a story of world historical significance if this is the Clotilda,\u201d said John Sledge, a senior historian with the Mobile Historical Commission. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly in the right vicinity. ... We always knew it should be right around there.\u201d Sledge is also the author of The Mobile River, an exhaustive examination of the river.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRaines notes that the ship lies exactly where Foster said he burned it, but so far, state laws governing ship wreckage have prevented investigators from exploring the part of the wreckage buried in the mud. Archaeologists are trying to use historical records and personal accounts to verify the ship\u2019s identity.\n\nOne of the accounts that researchers may use is from Zora Neale Hurston, who spent three months in Alabama interviewing Cudjo Lewis in 1931. Lewis came to the country on the Clotilda and was the last survivor of the mid-Atlantic slave trade.\n\nLewis spent five years as the property of Meaher. After he was emancipated, Lewis, along with other former slaves from his ship, demanded reparations. When they were denied, he and a group of slaves put their money together and founded the African-centered town of Africatown, located a few miles from Mobile. A new book by Hurston, Barracoon, about Lewis, will be released on May 5 by HarperCollins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Raines\u2019 find turns out to be the Clotilda, it may be one of the biggest and most important artifacts documenting the African slave trade.

She would later serve as the sorority\u2019s national president from 1967 to 1971.\n\nFreeman then enrolled in Howard University Law School, where she joined Epsilon Sigma Iota Sorority, the first American legal sorority for women of color.

I have zero science to back this up; nor do I have a link to a white paper from the Atlanta Conference of Negro Problems\u2019 (that was a real thing, by the way) early writings that proves this axiom dating back to the 1870s. Truth is, some shit is just true.\n\nWhich is why I\u2019m glad I was raised in a black household. There were things I grew up with and learned that I likely wouldn\u2019t have gotten had I grown up in any other circumstance. Also, you like how I properly used the term axiom?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, here are 10 reasons I\u2019m glad I was raised in a black household.\n\n1. I grew up listening to Luther Vandross.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine living in a world where I had to discover the greatness of Luther as an adult and then actively think about all the years I missed out on having that music in my life. As a youth, while I was living with my white mother, we listened to a veritable cornucopia of music, including black music. But in white households, that means Michael Jackson and Jimi Hendrix. My mother also has an affinity for Peaches & Herb\u2014\u201cReunited,\u201d to be specific.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut once I moved to live with my pops, I got nonstop Motown, Stax, Luther, Aretha and all the great music that spoke more directly to my soul than ZZ Top and AC/DC\u2014both groups I enjoy, but it\u2019s just ... different. To be fair, my father also had a penchant for Kenny G, and Rod Stewart was never too far. Nobody\u2019s perfect.\n\n2. I learned that when you see other people start running, you start running.\n\nI don\u2019t know what \u201cGet the fuck out of Dodge\u201d procedures are taught in other cultures or if any are taught at all. I do know that somewhere along the way, the words \u201cAnd boy, if you see a group of people running, you run in the same direction and you don\u2019t stop to ask no questions or find out what\u2019s going on until you see 75 to 96 percent of everybody else stop\u201d were passed to me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. I grew up on a significant number of black movies.\n\nIF there was a movie with mostly black people in it, we were watching it. From The Last Dragon to The Wiz. Of course, we watched anything with Eddie Murphy\u2014as did everybody, apparently. Did you know that Coming to America did nearly $300 million in 1988?! But I know who Sho\u2019nuff is, and even though I think the movie is trash, the soundtrack to The Wiz is amazeballs.\n\n4. Seasoning, seasoning everywhere.\n\nThis is one of those stereotypical things that I\u2019ve accepted as fact even though my proof is akin to the proof white folks needed to convict black men in the \u201950s. The only time I\u2019ve eaten white cooking has largely been when I was with my white mother during the summers, and she loved her some seasoning. Other than that, I can\u2019t actually say that I spent much time in any white people\u2019s households long enough to eat their cooking. Now that I think about this, I\u2019m not sure if this is sad or God\u2019s grace. Maybe it\u2019s both. Clearly, I don\u2019t know enough white people. Or any outside of family, really. In terms of other cultures, I know they be seasoning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. I grew up with a healthy fear of my parents.\n\nI\u2019m not saying other folks didn\u2019t, but I have children, which means I\u2019ve been to children\u2019s birthday parties and outings where other adults interacted with their children. Or even better: Last month, I had to fly to Detroit for a family situation. When I flew back to Washington, D.C., as I was walking through the TSA Precheck line (FTMFW!), a family of four was in front of me.\n\nThere was a bowl of peppermints available to folks in the line, and the mom made some remark about her maybe-12-year-old son and eating peppermints. This little white child yelled out, \u201cMom, you\u2019re SUCH A JERK SOMETIMES!\u201d Do you know the mom looked at me as if to see if anybody noticed, and I just shook my head?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, my black mother is a super-friendly, very nice, God-fearing woman who embarrasses easy when her very loud children (me and one of my sisters) get to the shenanigans. But do you know what I would NEVER fathom doing for fear of this woman who hasn\u2019t put a foreign object on me since fifth grade? Calling her a jerk or anything outside of her name ever\u2014but especially publicly.\n\nFor one, what if that sent her over the edge? For b, what if she said, \u201cI\u2019m gonna tell your father\u201d? That man listens to Kenny G. He\u2019s capable of anything. That little white boy yelled this IN FRONT of both his parents AT his mother. I\u2019m just saying. I\u2019ve got fear in my heart ... of my parents. It might not be a UNIVERSAL black trait, but I got it from my black-hand side.\n\n6. Life was one big-ass black history lesson.\n\nSure, we watched fun stuff, but my parents also made us watch movies about historical atrocities committed against black people. I remember watching a documentary on the Scottsboro Boys over and over again. Black books were around, and we had a black encyclopedia set and black-Jesus-centric Bible (still do).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sure in some homes, the talk about being a black man in America went something like, \u201cAight Ja\u2019Rome, get your black ass killed tonight by some cracka-ass-cracka white cop because YOU think it\u2019s a good idea to act like you ain\u2019t go\u2019 no damn sense hanging out there with DonQ\u2019uestajuan, Black and Lil Jimmy from 41st.\u201d In others, it wasn\u2019t so succinct and required a lot more subtlety and nuance.\n\nAlso, I grew up reading The Autobiography of Malcolm X and staring at the book version of Roots (seriously, that shit looks like it has all the pages) but watching the movie. Just saying, are white families making their kids read about Malcolm? I\u2019m better off for it.\n\n7. I went to typical long-service black churches as a youth.\n\nI currently attend a church\u2014when I\u2019m there\u2014that lasts about an hour, hour and a half tops. I appreciate this with all of the appreciation I can muster because I grew up going to church services that could last two-and-a-half hours, easy. And don\u2019t get me started on Easter. New suits are awesome, but sitting in there for a week waiting to get to another sermon about Jesus rising was not the business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoing to that solidly Southern, super-long black-church service has me looking at come-as-you-are, hourlong services like a smaller version of the lottery. I went to a white service once in Alabama, and aside from the music being trash (not sure we can call it that, actually), the service was so short that I thought maybe we were cheating God by leaving after only an hour. I also recognize not all nonblack churches believe in brevity.\n\n8. I learned the significance of NOT giving left-hand dap.\n\nDisrespect is the leading cause of death for black males between the age of birth and death. I\u2019ve said this for the past 20 years and I cannot be convinced this isn\u2019t true. One thing white dudes don\u2019t seem to mind doing is extending that left hand. I\u2019ve actually seen with my own two eyes a fight nearly break out because one dude refused to accept a left-handed dap and the other fellow took offense at the implication that he was being disrespectful by offering it. Again, disrespect is a thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. When somebody says \u201cIt\u2019s a black thing\u201d or \u201cThat\u2019s some white shit,\u201d I immediately understand what\u2019s happening.\n\nNo question is more annoying than \u201cWhat do you mean, it\u2019s a black thing? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d Especially coming from black people. You\u2019re just being contrarian or your parents REALLY tried to hide some shit from you. Mine didn\u2019t. I get it. And I always get it. And well, \u201cThat\u2019s some white shit\u201d is just one of those things that I believe growing up in a black household helped to crystallize, and largely covers the world of parenting, dancing, living, outdoor survival, near-death experiences for hobby or sport, and all other forms of noncolored active activities.\n\n10. I think being black is awesome and not some pathological condition that is full of negativity.\n\nI was raised to enjoy my blackness and believe that it didn\u2019t define me in any negative way. In fact, I believe that being black has only helped me out in life, whether through hard lessons and soft behinds or just by enjoying and appreciating seeing others succeed who know my life. Point is, growing up in my household helped me see pride, power and a bad-ass mudda who don\u2019t take no crap offa nobody.", "keywords": ["glad", "household", "shit", "black", "music", "raised", "reasons", "white", "know", "grew", "think", "ive", "dont", "im"], "polarity": 0.06031739351183798, "subjectivity": 0.4363167610852791},

I love wax prints (yes, I know they\u2019re actually Dutch/Indonesian), indigo mudcloth, Coptic crosses and Moroccan wedding blankets, and happen to be writing this while sitting under a red Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9 feather headdress gifted to me by a godmother who regularly visits the continent. I was born into that generation of children given African names by newly \u201cwoke\u201d parents (mine borrowed from the title of a Miles Davis song). And I may have rocked an African medallion in the early \u201990s, and head wraps well before Erykah Badu dropped her debut single.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s 2017, and I have no intention of attending a kinara-lighting ceremony looking like I\u2019m wearing a Kwanzaa costume. I\u2019m also not immune to the argument that there\u2019s a measure of appropriation in the way many of us approach wearing African fashion, as posited in 2015 by writer Zipporah Gene.\n\nWhile Gene\u2019s argument had a few holes, in an era in which African-inspired fashions and decor have reached peak popularity, it\u2019s well worth ongoing consideration and discussion of where the appreciation of our mother culture began and how to ensure it doesn\u2019t cross the appropriative line. As writer Nadra Nittle noted, in response to Gene\u2019s thesis:\n\nDonning dashikis, rejecting straightened hair, and taking on Afrocentric names directly originated from the \u201cblack is beautiful\u201d movement, which promoted black self-love. Embracing an African aesthetic during this period required courage, considering that in the recent past black students were discouraged from wearing bright colors, let alone African dress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo is there a right way to pay reverence to the culture while rocking a current trend? Of course. To start, don\u2019t treat it like a trend. But in addition, I like to follow a few basic guidelines:\n\nShop From the Source\n\nDid you know you can buy Ankara-printed dresses on Amazon.com for under $50? Of course, you could also spend several hundreds more, and buy them from English designer and Beatle progeny Stella McCartney, who was taken to task this fall for using African prints (and a noticeable lack of African models) in her Spring 2018 collection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeedless to say, there are better ways to get the look while supporting designers of the African Diaspora: Think less Stella McCartney, more Stella Jean\u2014or Nigerian-born Duro Olowu. I personally love to support African designers by hitting African-owned Etsy and pop-up shops, like the many thrown by online marketplace Zuvaa this past year.\n\nA recent new find at one of these events? Benin-born designer Eldior Sodeck, whose Ankara-patterned silhouettes range from traditional to Afrofuturist, with nods to athleisure and Japanese kimonos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t Mix and Max Out on Metaphors\n\nWith such a wealth of beautiful African goods out there, it\u2019s tempting to pile it all on\u2014but just because you can doesn\u2019t mean you should. You don\u2019t need to make a statement. African fashions are so striking, it\u2019s generally ideal to pick one item or category\u2014a bag or a blouse or an armful of bracelets (not all at once)\u2014and let that speak for itself. Besides, Africa is an entire continent, which means that putting too many elements together can actually be culturally confusing.\n\nCome Culturally Correct\n\nSince Kwanzaa is an African-American holiday, it\u2019s only fair to remind you that there are plenty of African-American designers doing the damn thing\u2014and evoking African styles and silhouettes in the process. Not sure where to start? Check out Demestik by Reuben Reuel or Onion Cut & Sewn by Whitney Mero. Feeling creative? Brooklyn, N.Y.-based home-design brand AphroChic sells its culturally evocative patterns by the yard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKnow Your History\n\nDo you know where the Ankara print originated, and how it evolved? How about the centuries of religious history behind the Coptic cross? Have you ever unraveled the complicated history of head wraps?\n\nThe fact is, there\u2019s a wealth of information out there to inform and support your style choices (ask Google\u2014she knows everything). Just having some basic knowledge can transform trend chasing into a teachable moment. For instance, if you\u2019re still conflicted about appropriation, Nadra Nittle also gifted us with this little bit of historical reference, which is handy for both Kwanzaa and the greater civil conflict in which we still find ourselves:\n\nAmerican blacks saw a parallel between Africa\u2019s struggle for independence and their own struggle for equal rights in the United States. Their interest in African fashion never stemmed from a desire to rip off African peoples and popularize their customs for profit, as is often the case with cultural appropriation. It stemmed from the desire to carve out a new racial identity in a nation that had not only treated them as sub-humans, but also taught them to buy into damaging stereotypes about their ancestral homeland, further instilling in them a sense of inferiority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Liberian-born designer Abios\u00e9 Decont\u00e9e Massaquoi of Fiend List, the feeling is entirely mutual.\n\n\u201cYou know, I came from Liberia when I was young, and I came to America. And as an immigrant, coming from where I came from, I can appreciate what America [has] done for me,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd so, when I advertise my stuff ... I always, I always try to do it in a way where everybody can wear it, and enjoy it; kind of as a way of getting people together.\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s not appreciation, I don\u2019t know what is.", "keywords": ["trend", "kwanzaa", "black", "fashion", "ankhs", "ankara", "right", "know", "rock", "stella", "ongoing", "way", "style", "argument", "wearing", "african", "appropriationvsappreciation", "love"], "polarity": 0.1284000721500721, "subjectivity": 0.39345306024993526},

A firebombing at the Everses\u2019 home in Jackson, Miss., forced Medgar and Myrlie to subject their young children to duck-and-cover drills in case of future terror attacks.\n\n\u201cI often wondered how Medgar could tolerate the anger and the hatred that was shown to him\u2014to his people, to all of us. How could he do it and not go off on some kind of rampage?\u201d Evers-Williams recalled in a recent interview. \u201cI told him I don\u2019t think I would be able to do it. He would just look at me and shake his head and say, \u2018Forget about yourself, it\u2019s larger than you. It\u2019s about all of us.\u201d\n\nThen, late on a Wednesday night in June 1963, a Klansman named Byron De La Beckwith hid in the bushes with a rifle and shot Medgar Evers in the back. It took three juries and more than 30 years to put Beckwith behind bars, where he died. After everything that her family endured, it\u2019s easy to understand why Evers-Williams, who grew up in Vicksburg, Miss., had difficulty trusting the state of Mississippi.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet, on Saturday, Evers-Williams will be seated alongside fellow civil rights veterans, political officials and other dignitaries to help cut the ribbon for the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum in Jackson. President Donald Trump, who was endorsed by Medgar Evers\u2019 brother, Charles, is also scheduled to attend the ceremony. This, despite Trump\u2019s own rocky relationship with African Americans, including failing to condemn white nationalists and criticizing black pro athletes for protesting police brutality.\n\nThe grand opening of the nation\u2019s first state-run civil rights museum coincides with the opening of the adjacent Museum of Mississippi History as well as the state\u2019s bicentennial.\n\nThe opening of the two facilities, which together cost upward of $90 million to construct, comes after a series of early controversies about the Civil Rights Museum\u2019s location and the decision to build two museums\u2014quietly derided in some circles as separate but equal buildings, a reference to the prevailing dictum of Jim Crow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Mississippi is embroiled in debate over whether to remove a Confederate battle emblem from its official state flag, the last one in the country to incorporate the Southern cross.\n\nGiven the state\u2019s racial history and unwillingness to let go of vestiges of the Confederacy, the opening also has raised questions about whether a state-government-run museum will tell the whole, ugly truth about the civil rights era.\n\nThese are questions that Pamela Junior, the executive director of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum, gets regularly. Junior says that as long as she\u2019s in charge, the museum will tell \u201cthe good, the bad and all of the ugly.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for the rationale for the two museums, Junior, who was not involved in the early planning of the museum, said the History Museum attempts to cover 50,000 years, only 30 of which include the civil rights movement. By contrast, the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum devotes an entire high-tech facility, complete with exhibits, artifacts, films, meeting space and future programming, to the time period spanning 1619\u2014when the first enslaved Africans arrived at a Jamestown, Va., colony\u2014to 1965 and beyond.\n\n\u201cWe were ground zero for the movement. Why should people go to Memphis [Tenn.] when we were here?\u201d says Junior, referring to the National Civil Rights Museum, housed three hours away at the Lorraine Motel, where Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated (the National Civil Rights Museum is run by a private foundation, not the state of Tennessee). \u201cWe\u2019re telling the truth. It\u2019s not a wonderful story. It\u2019s beautiful. Then again, it is in darkness that we finally see light. A lot of people went into the tunnel in the state of Mississippi in order to bring light to Mississippi.\u201d\n\nThe museum consists of eight galleries that cover almost 350 years of African-American history in Mississippi, starting with slavery and going through Reconstruction and Jim Crow\u2019s early days; four steel pillars carry the names of people who were lynched.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmall theaters, with trigger warnings posted out front, highlight pivotal moments in the movement, including the stories of three civil rights workers who were killed near Philadelphia, Miss.; Medgar Evers; and Emmett Till, whose case is the subject of a short film narrated by Mississippi native Oprah Winfrey.\n\nThe front doors from the Bryant Grocery and Meat Market in Money, Miss., in which Emmett walked through for the last time in the summer of 1955, are on display.\n\nDeborah Watts, a Till cousin who grew up in Nebraska, was a toddler when Emmett was kidnapped, beaten and murdered after a white woman named Carolyn Bryant said the boy flirted with her and, in the aftermath of his death, his mangled face appeared in Jet magazine. Earlier this year, news reports emerged that Bryant, who is still alive, fabricated parts of her story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Lynching of Emmett Till\u201d exhibit at the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) \u201cNAACP\u2019s Man in the Field\u201d exhibit (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum)\n\n\u201cSeparate Is Not Always Equal,\u201d exhibit view 1 (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) \u201cSeparate Is Not Always Equal,\u201d exhibit view 2 (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) \u201cSeparate Is Not Always Equal,\u201d exhibit view 3 (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) Gallery entryway (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum)\n\nRear view of re-created church (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) \u201cIs This America?\u201d exhibit (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum)\n\nWide-angle view of gallery 7 of Black Empowerment Gallery (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) Vernon Dahmer exhibit 1 in the Black Empowerment Gallery (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) Vernon Dahmer exhibit 2 in the Black Empowerment Gallery (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) This Little Light of Mine sculpture (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) This Little Light of Mine sculpture (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) This Little Light of Mine sculpture (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) 1 / 14\n\nWatts remembers that there was such a heavy mourning when Emmett\u2019s mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, visited Omaha to give a speech, Watts ripped up flyers that were being distributed about the incident; in her child\u2019s mind, the flyers were the cause of the sadness. Watts, who now lives in the Minneapolis area and founded the Emmett Till Legacy Foundation, said that Mississippi went from a place she avoided to some place to which she felt drawn, adding that the Civil Rights Museum represents a new day.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a greater sense of determination and responsibility to Emmett and those others whose blood was shed there and how important it was for justice to prevail,\u201d Watts said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn keeping with the theme of telling ugly-but-whole truths, the .30-06 Enfield rifle Beckwith used to kill Medgar Evers will be on display in one of the theaters; during a film on the Evers story, special lights will illuminate the gun.\n\nHis widow, Evers-Williams, says she is surprised that the rifle was ever recovered, much less ended up in a museum. Yet she is grateful the gun will be on display to send a message that weapons can be used for good but that Beckwith\u2019s rifle was used for \u201cpure evil.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople will see it as a weapon that was used to take his life, but also, perhaps, as a weapon that was used\u2014unlike the person who pulled the trigger intended\u2014to lift Medgar up in a way that we understand who he was, how he felt about his state of Mississippi, his people, people as a whole, and how he felt about his country,\u201d Evers-Williams said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Evers-Williams, learning to entrust the state of Mississippi with Medgar\u2019s legacy took some soul-searching. She hopes that the Mississippi museums can be a major force in helping us be what we can be as a nation.\n\n\u201cI am human. I am still angry. I have been able to remove myself from the deep hatred that I felt when my husband was shot down at his door and our children ran out crying, \u2018Daddy, get up!

What did she do? She doubled and tripled down on it. She went so far as to change her name to Nkechi Diallo, while some of you are running around with names like Ashley and Donald. I ... I don\u2019t even know what else to say. Except for never go Eric Ben\u00e9t. You see what I did there? Probably not. Let\u2019s move on.\n\nI don\u2019t know if Rachel\u2014her mama named her Rachel, I\u2019m gon\u2019 call her Rachel\u2014is broke, practicing for the Trollympics or just plain ol\u2019 bored and bought a nice new starter DSLR camera and a quote book, but she has decided to offer herself up as tribute to the comedy gods by putting together and dropping a calendar for 2018 featuring provocative (and slightly awkward) photos of herself and quotes like \u201cStay woke & change the world. You never know when an important opportunity will arise.\u201d I can see you all rushing to RachelDolezal.com right now to buy your own copy. Kidding! Why so serious?!\n\n(Also, the \u201cShop\u201d on her website includes items for sale that you\u2019d find at that local store in your mall that also sells black-Greek-letter-organization paraphernalia and those bad black paintings that everybody\u2019s grandma has a few prints of; it includes \u201cGimme Some Sugar Lollipops,\u201d \u201cMelanin Spectrum Dolls\u201d and \u201cShine On Soy Candles.\u201d)\n\nNow, my first instinct is to point and laugh with pure amusement at the traveshamockery that is this woman\u2019s bag since we all came to know of her existence a few years ago. Who in their right mind would make such a purchase, and for why? Does she have actual fans? Is anybody jackin\u2019 their jollies to Rachel Dolezal and just needed 12 months of pictures to do so? Like, what\u2019s a good reason for any single soul to make this $18.99 purchase?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTurns out, I can think of 10 reasons to buy this calendar as part of your Chrimmuh shopping.\n\n1. It\u2019s an amazing conversation starter.\n\nImagine having this calendar hanging up in your home, office or brothel. Who isn\u2019t going to say something about it? Either folks know who she is and will wonder why you have it, or not know who she is and wonder why you have this mediocre white woman with locs performing bad implied lust with nonsensical quotes attached.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe calendar, or at least the samples she made available, is reminiscent of people I hate most on Instagram who take thirst-trap pictures of themselves in thongs and pasties, then attach some fake-deep inspirational caption telling you to be your best self and love Jesus.\n\n2. It could be a conversation starter ... that\u2019s also a doorstop.\n\nHear me out. On Amazon.com, doorstops range from $3.95 to $24.95, but I mean, those are the ones you expect to see. What if you put this under a door and somebody comes in and sees it? Of course, they\u2019re going to look down and say, \u201cBruh, is that motherfucking Rachel Dolezal on your floor keeping the door open?\u201d Just saying. Think about it. It\u2019s probably meta or something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. If you\u2019ve got a thing for white women, this kills two birds with one stone.\n\nHey, black man, you get to buy a calendar of a white woman, but she has locs and swears that she\u2019s a black woman on the inside. And again, her name is Nkechi now, legally. Sure, you love you some white women, but you get to act like you managed to find the blackest one out there. She\u2019s even a playable card in the race-centric game Trading Races, where the goal is to debate the blackest person in the deck. That\u2019s a win-win.\n\n4. It\u2019s a great gag gift.\n\nWho wouldn\u2019t laugh and grant the room an elongated \u201cNiggaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\u201d upon receiving this gift?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. At $18.99 it might make the best Secret Santa or White Elephant gift of all time ... as long as nobody has to divulge what came from whom.\n\nHow annoyed would you be if you pulled this gift? On the flip side, if you work in a white office, it might be hilarious and telling to see how folks respond to this calendar.\n\n6. It\u2019s also a perfect petty gift. I believe in petty.\n\nYour sister has been acting better than other people? Cool. Catch this December Dolezal, b. Your cousin claims nobody ever gets him anything even though he\u2019s been getting everything he ever wanted from Grandma since he was born? Cool. Catch this January Dolezal, LeDerrick-Joseph.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. If you want to support the self-identity-over-everything movement, here\u2019s your chance.\n\nBuying this calendar can prove just how committed you are to living your truest self and not letting society or anybody else tell you who you are, Moana. No one goes beyond the reef? Rachel Dolezal goes beyond the reef.\n\n8. Because maybe you don\u2019t actually find her that problematic.\n\nThere are some folks who actually don\u2019t have a problem with her or her antics. They don\u2019t view them as antics at all, in fact, but as a woman living her truth. Well, this is how you can show your real support for her. Nothing says \u201cI support this motherfucker\u201d like paying for a whole-ass calendar of that person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. The calendar is filled with birthdays and black-history facts.\n\nIf nothing else, you have to appreciate her dedication to this plight and life of hers. This calendar adds to that, since I doubt there are any white-history alternative facts in it. If you\u2019re one of those people who are like, \u201cI have to respect her dedication,\u201d then here\u2019s a perfect item for you!\n\n10. It can be turned into a family bonding experience.\n\nYou, as a family, can split the $18.99 (plus HOLY SHIT, SHIPPING IS $10) and pass the Dolezal calendar around the family as a running gag for the whole year. I don\u2019t know how much bonding it creates, but at the very least, the jokes will fly on the first of each month, and what\u2019s better than one billionaire? Two. Especially if they come from the same hue as you. Sorry, I didn\u2019t think anybody was still reading this far.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDonotbuythisthingwhat\u2019swrongwithyou.", "keywords": ["gift", "2018", "support", "reasons", "thats", "calendar", "know", "white", "dolezals", "buy", "think", "real", "dont", "thing", "dolezal", "great", "woman", "rachel"], "polarity": 0.10608969441247923, "subjectivity": 0.5125093155789359},

Franklin, who directly confronted America\u2019s racist history and helped shaped the discourse around America\u2019s legacy of slavery. The stretch of road was dedicated to the influential scholar Monday afternoon at the Hayti Heritage Center.\n\n\n\nAs the Raleigh News and Observer notes, Franklin\u2019s name on a Southern roadway, which will now be called Dr. John H. Franklin Highway, is significant, particularly in North Carolina. It wasn\u2019t that long ago when visitors and residents entering the Tar Heel State were confronted with a welcome sign from the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClick here to view this www.newsobserver.com embed.\n\nFranklin, who died in 2009, was described by fellow historian Nell Irvin Painter as \u201cthe first great American historian to reckon the price [America] owed in violence, autocracy and militarism.\u201d\n\nFranklin meticulously documented African-American history. In 1947 he published From Slavery to Freedom: A History of African-Americans, described in his New York Times obituary as \u201cone of the definitive historical surveys of the American black experience\u201d and by Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert W. Fogel as \u201ca landmark in the interpretation of American civilization.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former Duke University professor was among the first American scholars to confront the hypocrisy of America\u2019s ideals against its history of white supremacy. In one of his final works, a 2007 article for the Atlantic Monthly, Franklin wrote that \u201cif the American idea was to fight every war from the beginning of colonization to the middle of the 20th century with Jim Crow armed forces, in the belief that this would promote the American idea of justice and equality, then the American idea was an unmitigated disaster and a denial of the very principles that this country claimed as its rightful heritage.\u201d\n\nAs the Times wrote, Franklin earned many \u201cfirsts\u201d throughout his storied career. He was the first black president of the American Historical Association and the first black person to present a paper at the Southern Historical Association, which was segregated at the time (the group later elected him as its president). He was also the first black professor to serve as department chair in a majority-white institution (Brooklyn College).\n\nFranklin also applied his gifts as a scholar to the fight for civil rights, working on Thurgood Marshall\u2019s legal team in the Brown v. Board of Education case, the landmark Supreme Court case that struck down \u201cseparate but equal\u201d schooling in 1954. For his contributions, Franklin received the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, from Bill Clinton in 1995.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFranklin was originally from Oklahoma, but North Carolina became his adopted home state.\n\n\u201cDurham and the entire state of North Carolina were blessed to become his home,\u201d North Carolina Gov.

He successfully protested to desegregate Philadelphia\u2019s trolleys, he fought to pass constitutional amendments enfranchising black citizens, and then he worked to bring those new black voters to the polls.\ufeff\n\nCatto was assassinated in 1871\u2014only six years after the Civil War ended\u2014when gangs of armed white Philadelphians took to the streets to prevent black people from voting. That year\u2019s was the first election in which the city\u2019s black men could participate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Philadelphia magazine, Catto was shot twice in the back by a white man after sending teachers and students at his school home early that day, lest they encounter any violence. He was 32.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon in Philadelphia, 146 years after he was gunned down two doors away from his house, a monument to Catto will be unveiled at City Hall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Philly.com reports, Catto\u2019s likeness will be the first public monument to honor a specific black American on the city\u2019s public landscape, and the first statue to go up at City Hall in nearly a century.\n\nCatto\u2019s statue is officially titled A Quest for Parity and is the work of Branley Cadet, a black artist based out of California.\n\nCadet recognizes that the site on which the monument will be erected was \u201ctransformed\u201d by Catto\u2019s work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey fought to desegregate the trolley cars,\u201d Cadet told Philly.com about the civil rights leader and his contemporaries. \u201cThey fought to ratify the 15th Amendment.

I have managed to uncover bits and pieces of information here and there, but some are contradictory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHenry Ransom may have escaped from the plantation of Joseph Fox of Westmoreland County, Va. My attempts at gathering more information on Joseph Fox have been unsuccessful so far apart from one vague census record. Recently, however, I searched the Maryland State Archives and found the name of Hannah Ransom of Calvert County listed as a refugee. Is this my ancestor? I suspect she may be related to me because I also heard that Henry Ransom arrived in Trinidad with \u201cAnna\u201d Ransom and three children. Please help me learn more about them. \u2014Korinne Louison\n\nAs your question and others we have answered in previous columns illustrate, numerous enslaved people resisted their servitude. While our research did not turn up a definitive link between Henry Ransom and Hannah Ransom, or Henry and Joseph Fox, we found some leads that you should follow. We also noticed that the surname \u201cRansom\u201d in Maryland and Virginia has a striking association with resistance to slavery.\n\nThe War of 1812 Provides Freedom for Some\n\nIn fighting on the side of the British during the War of 1812 and settling in the English Caribbean colony of Trinidad in 1814, your Henry Ransom apparently followed a similar path to that of Ezekiel Loney, an escaped Virginia slave whose background we traced in the column \u201cMy \u2018Merikin\u2019 Ancestor Escaped Slavery.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs mentioned, during that war, the British military invited escaped American slaves from mainly coastal Virginia, Maryland and Georgia to fight on their side in exchange for freedom and land in the West Indies. Those who immigrated to Trinidad after their service, as well as their families, were called \u201cMerikins.\u201d\n\nAs you mentioned, Hannah Ransom of Calvert County, Md., is listed as a \u201cWar of 1812 Refugee\u201d on a website of the Maryland State Archives. Given the relative closeness of Westmoreland County, Va., and Calvert County, Md., it\u2019s plausible that she is your Anna Ransom. Unfortunately, the website is not very clear on what records were used to compile this list or where you might find more information. You could contact the Maryland Historical Society to inquire about Hannah Ransom to see if it has any more information that could connect her to a former slave owner, to Henry Ransom or to the emigr\u00e9s.\n\nAn Earlier Attempt to Escape Bondage\n\nWhile researching this, we came across information about a widely documented slave insurrection associated with the surname \u201cRansom\u201d more than 70 years before the War of 1812. The Maryland State Archives has a list of people who were \u201cgibbeted\u201d for crimes between 1723 and 1775, including a \u201cNegro Jack Ransom\u201d in 1740 for \u201cinsurrection\u201d in Prince George\u2019s County (near Hannah Ransom\u2019s Calvert County). Gibbeting refers to a practice of hanging the body of an executed criminal on display to deter others from committing the same crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWriting for the William and Mary Quarterly in April 1978, historian Allan Kulikoff described the events that led to Jack Ransom\u2019s execution:\n\nThe Negroes spent eight months in 1739 planning to seize their freedom by killing their masters and other white families in the neighborhood. Their leader, Jack Ransom, was probably a native [African American], but most of the conspirators were [born] Africans, for it is reported that the planning was done by the slaves in \u201ctheir country language.\u201d The revolt was postponed several times and finally the white authorities got wind of it. Stephen Boardley, an Annapolis lawyer, reported that whites believed that 200 slaves planned to kill all of the white men, marry the white women, and then unite both shores of Maryland under their control.\n\nWith the alleged plot foiled, Jack was arrested, tried and executed for conspiracy to raise an insurrection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a chart compiled by the Maryland State Archives and based on court records, Jack Ransom was charged with his crime on Dec. 1, 1739, convicted in March of 1739-40 and executed on April 4, 1740. He had been enslaved by Jane Brooke (pdf).\n\nA more detailed description of the Jack Ransom story on the Brandywine, Md., website describes Jack Ransom as an intelligent man between the ages of 40 and 50. Among the other four slaves indicted was a \u201cGeorge,\u201d who was also owned by Brooke. Unlike Jack, George was acquitted. This account also provides more details about Jane Brooke; her husband, Clement Brooke Sr., who had died two years prior to the incident; and the Poplar Neck tobacco plantation she owned, which had at least seven slaves and which was in the Brooke family from 1671 until 1870.\n\nIt seems a strong possibility that the Clement Brooke residing at Prince George\u2019s County, Md., in 1790 was a descendant. You might benefit from examining the papers for this family to see if they have a connection to Joseph Fox or if there is a bill of sale between the two families that could connect your Ransom family to Jack Ransom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHad Henry Ransom Escaped Fox\u2019s Plantation?\n\nAs for Joseph Fox, he was residing at Westmoreland, Va., in 1820, at which time he had 28 slaves recorded in his household. Ten years prior, in 1810, he was also recorded at Westmoreland County, Va., with 24 slaves recorded in his household. It would be between these two dates that your Henry Ransom escaped and joined the British in 1814.\n\nThese records do not provide many clues about your relatives, since the recording of enslaved persons in both enumeration did not include their names (which was the practice until the end of slavery). The number of slaves in the household increased from 1810 to 1820, and you know that at least your ancestor escaped in between these years, so it is possible that Joseph Fox was purchasing slaves during that decade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLocating records for any of those whom Joseph Fox enslaved might provide clues about your ancestors. However, you are not going to find any census records earlier than 1810 for Westmoreland County because fires destroyed the records from 1790 to 1800. Gaining a better understanding of what records are available for Westmoreland County may help you determine where to look for more information.\n\nWe located a marriage record for Joseph Fox and Mary Hipkins at Westmoreland County, Va., on April 5, 1788. It is always a good idea to note the women entering a family, since slaves were often brought into estates through marriage, as part of a woman\u2019s dowry or by inheritance.\n\nGenealogies of Virginia Families notes that the Joseph Fox who married Mary Hipkins was the son of Joseph and Anjalettah (Wroe) Fox. The younger Joseph Fox was justice of the peace in 1798 and was elected clerk of Westmoreland in 1799, a position he held until his death in 1823. This also states that Joseph Fox Sr. died in 1804 and the will was proved Oct. 22, 1804, at Westmoreland, Va. The probate record for Joseph Fox Sr. may be the one you will want to focus on, since he may have left slaves to his son.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to this source, Joseph Fox Sr. also had six daughters. You may also want to investigate records for the estates of his daughters\u2019 husbands because it is possible that your Henry Ransom was owned by someone else in the family but the connection to a Joseph Fox was still remembered.\n\nThe Family History Library has probate records for Westmoreland County available on microfilm that you could view at your local Family History Center. It also has digitized copies of some land and probate records, but they, too, must be viewed within a Family History Center. You could also contact the county clerk or other relevant repositories for the county directly to see if you could obtain a copy of Joseph Fox Sr.\u2019s probate record or other records relating to the Fox family and their estates.\n\nWhere Did the \u201cRansom\u201d Name Come From?\n\nFinally, determining where your ancestors got the \u201cRansom\u201d surname may lead you to more information. In 1810, there were a few slave owners with the surname \u201cRansom\u201d residing in Virginia. In Buckingham County, Va., William Ransom owned 15 slaves, and recorded directly under him was Elizabeth Ransom with 18 slaves. Perhaps there is a bill of sale in records for these individuals that could prove a connection to Joseph Fox and your Ransom ancestors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaul Heinegg has an article on free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware about a family with the \u201cRansom\u201d surname who were free in North Carolina in the mid-18th century. Although we found no slave owners with the surname \u201cRansom\u201d in North Carolina in 1810, you may still want to investigate this free black family to see if you can make a connection to yours. Heinegg has also abstracted tax lists that you may also want to search for the surname.\n\nFinally, searching records linked to Trinidad may turn up leads. There are some collections at the National Archives of Trinidad and Tobago that might be helpful, such as the Land Ownership Records and Assessment. The U.K. National Archives also have collections of Trinidad correspondence and maps from this era that may include information on Colonial Marine settlement.\n\nHenry Louis Gates Jr. is the Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and founding director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard University.

White-owned businesses in the South often refused to service vehicles driven by African Americans. Even stopping to use gas station restrooms was fraught with peril across the Southern United States. In 1956, only three hotels in the entire state of New Hampshire offered accommodations to black travelers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThus, this was not just a Southern phenomenon. According to the book Sundown Towns: A Hidden Dimension of Racism, by the end of the 1960s, more than 10,000 towns forbade blacks from entering their city limits after dark, including Glendale, Calif., and Warren, Mich. Over half the incorporated towns in Illinois were \u201csundown towns\u201d like Anna, Ill., which expelled its entire black population in 1909 and had the unofficial slogan \u201cAin\u2019t no niggers allowed.\u201d\n\nIn 1937, a mail carrier named Victor Hugo Green published the Negro Motorist Green Book\u2014a guide for New York of places that welcomed black travelers. He relied on information from fellow black postal carriers, and the book became so popular, many referred to it as \u201cthe bible for black travelers.\u201d By the time the last edition of the Green Book was published in 1966-1967, it had expanded from a 15-page guide for New York to 99 pages of information indicating safe harbor for blacks traveling all over America and internationally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreated by the South Carolina African American Heritage Commission, the Green Book of South Carolina has been designed for travelers and residents interested in the cultural and historical sites across the state. Similar to a tourism app, it encompasses every county in South Carolina and highlights the rich cultural history of places like Charleston\u2019s slave market, numerous civil rights landmarks and the historic Rosenwald Schools.\n\n\u201cThe development of the mobile guide perfectly aligns with our organization\u2019s mission to identify and promote the preservation of historic sites, structures, buildings and culture of the African-American experience in South Carolina,\u201d said Jannie Harriot, vice chairperson of the commission. (In the interests of full disclosure, Jannie Harriot is related to the writer by motherhood.)\n\nThe South Carolina African American Heritage Commission works to increase the social, political and economic value of South Carolina African-American heritage; encourage and demonstrate respect for all heritages; document and institutionalize African-American heritage as an ongoing goal of preservation; and explore all areas of South Carolina for African-American contributions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheck out the Green Book of South Carolina here.", "keywords": ["history", "green", "turns", "guide", "black", "tool", "carolina", "mobile", "south", "painful", "book", "towns", "travelers", "traveling", "african", "learning", "heritage"], "polarity": 0.04276751893939394, "subjectivity": 0.315909090909091},
{"url": "https://www.theroot.com/violence-is-never-the-answer-for-black-people-1795379582", "title": "/violence-is-never-the-answer-for-black-people-", "text": "There is one universal subject that cannot be ignored when explaining history, dissecting the status of marginalized people around the world, or pursuing any understanding of society, culture or politics. It is an unavoidable component that must be factored into any academic or intellectual examination of civilization, social order or government.\n\nThat subject is violence.\n\nHowever, when discussing African Americans or anything related to blackness, one must delete all mentions of it from the conversation. Even though it is as old as humanity and has been the driving force of every movement that ever existed, when mentioned in conjunction with the history of black people in America, bringing up the subject of violence is forbidden. Unless one wants to be accused of promoting it or rabble-rousing or simply dismissed out of hand, violence is a universal no-no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTake Texas A&M University professor Tommy Curry, for instance. According to Mic, Curry has recently experienced death threats, harassment and professional admonishment after conservative outlets dug up old statements by the philosophy professor in which he brought up the absence of a discussion of violence in black intellectualism.\n\nThe vitriol surrounding Curry is not because of beliefs he espoused to students in a classroom setting. The breakout of right-wing butt-hurt surrounding the educator comes from statements he made outside the university setting, on a podcast five years ago. Compounding the uproar\u2019s stupidity is the fact that Curry made a valid point:\n\nWhat we have today is a situation where the symbols of [Dr. Martin Luther] King and peaceful white progressives have become the hallmarks of the black civil rights struggle. ... What I\u2019m surprised about is that I\u2019ve seen no black public intellectual come out and actually address the issue of violence or social revolution or radical self-defense by black people historically.\n\nAlthough the quote seems innocuous enough in posing an academic question, when someone dug the interview out of the archives, right-wing outlets like the American Conservative and the Washington Examiner escalated the Africana-studies professor to the title of \u201canti-white hatemonger,\u201d who made \u201cgenocidal comments.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn response to the outbreak of white butthurt, Texas A&M\u2019s president issued a public statement condemning Curry for his comments:\n\nAs you may know, a podcast interview by one of our professors that took place approximately four-and-a-half years ago resurfaced this week on social media, seen for the first time by many of us. The interview features disturbing comments about race and violence that stand in stark contrast to Aggie core values\u2014most notably those of respect, excellence, leadership and integrity\u2014values that we hold true toward all of humanity. ... We wish no violence or harm even to those who espouse hateful views under the First Amendment, a sentiment that by its very nature is one that they would deny others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere is the thing: No matter how many pearls white people begin clutching, an institution of higher learning should never condemn a professor for advancing academic thought. The consideration of radical thought is almost the textbook definition of philosophy.\n\nTexas A&M likely has a history class that teaches how the American Revolution was kick-started when a radical group called the Sons of Liberty boarded a ship and threw the tea overboard. I\u2019m sure there is a class that discusses how brave souls are reshaping the political and economic climate in the Middle East with the citizen-driven Arab Spring. Even the invisible deity, the idea of whom conservatives love, but whose words they conveniently ignore, believed that he couldn\u2019t save this cruel, corrupt world unless his son shed some blood.\n\nBut for black people? Not so much.\n\nIn all of this white-knuckle hand-wringing, Curry\u2019s larger point has been lost:\n\n\n\nThere has never been a major change movement in the history of the world that hasn\u2019t involved violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerica has brainwashed both blacks and whites into believing that African Americans gained their rights by behaving obediently and observing the law. We have allowed them to white out from the history books the Black Panthers, Deacons for Defense and all the groups that advocated for self-defense. They conveniently forget that the only people who acted civilly during the civil rights movement were the people whose skin was ripped by water hoses and whose bones were shattered by batons.\n\nThe civil rights movement was not a movement of nonviolence. Ask Medgar Evers. Ask Malcolm X. Ask the mirage of whitewashed history that white America posthumously made a saint and a martyr after snuffing out his fire: Martin Luther King Jr. could confirm all of this if white violence had not splattered his brains across the balcony of a Memphis, Tenn., hotel.\n\nNow that we have uncovered the serious and introspective parts, there are two more parts of this debate that are simultaneously infuriating and hilarious:\n\nTexas A&M is the same school that recently allowed Richard Spencer\u2014the poster boy for the filtered lumps of diarrhea remnants who call themselves the \u201calt-right\u201d\u2014 to speak on campus and spread his message, which includes ethnic cleansing to make a whiter America. This is the same Richard Spencer who led a group of torch-bearing protesters reminiscent of a Ku Klux Klan mob in a Virginia rally for Confederate monuments last week and ...\n\n... this is the incredible part. In the podcast interview, Professor Curry was talking about the inhumane violence against whites and the results it produced ... in a movie!!!\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, this whole debate is about how some white people with sensitive sphincters have gotten their panties in a bunch by taking a professor out of context from a podcast discussing Django Unchained.\n\nOh, white America, you will never stop being funny.\n\nThe movie thing aside, silencing someone who actually studies the issues (Curry teaches a class on critical race theory) in favor of Caucasian emotions is the antithesis of education. It is what the hypocritical conservatives talk about when they lament the rise of political correctness. It is the privilege of discussing the musket bearers who fought for slavery while suppressing the mention of black freedom fighters. It is white fragility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are some who will say this piece of writing advocates violence, just as there are people across Texas and the country calling for Curry to be fired for 5-year-old statements about a Jamie Foxx movie. Because everyone in America deserves the right to self-examination, freedom of speech and a safe space to openly examine their intellectual ideas ...\n\nExcept black people.", "keywords": ["history", "black", "curry", "professor", "podcast", "white", "violence", "america", "movement", "answer", "rights"], "polarity": 0.04543245869776482, "subjectivity": 0.3766844833171363},

Especially cooking. Food has always been a source of comfort and therapy for us. It brings us closer together during life\u2019s worst, grandest and most lit moments.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m a foodie and a kick-ass cook, if I can boast for a minute. Technically, I should call myself a chef. I do always pick the appropriate ingredients to pair with the sometimes edible monstrosities that rear their ugly heads in the food baskets on Chopped. Also, I have prepared jackfruit salsa and shrimp tacos, and they were BOMB.\n\nI am fairly open to eating many foods as well. Hell, I\u2019ve even had tarantula. Don\u2019t judge me. It tastes like fluffy crab, but it\u2019s not as firm as lobster meat.\n\nWith that said, there are certain \u201cblack foods\u201d that are overrated as fuck. I can legit do without them. And seeing people\u2019s reactions and hearing them try to convince me that somehow \u201cI can\u2019t be doing it right\u201d is hella amusing.\n\nHere are five foods that should be bound to hell (in my Cardi B voice) FUH-EVAH!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Fried Chicken Skin\n\nFried chicken skin is gross. It\u2019s like somebody\u2019s Big Mama jacked Leatherface\u2019s mask, fried it until it was extra crunchy and then wrapped it around juicy, well-seasoned meat. And telling black folks that you don\u2019t partake in the consumption of fried chicken skin is like telling them you drink beer with a straw.\n\nIt makes me want to gag, and seeing chicken skin raw doesn\u2019t help. Jesus be a fence around that film that\u2019s between the skin and the meat. I can\u2019t do it. I peel the skin off completely, season, batter and then fry. It\u2019s the only way to do it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it\u2019s still crunchy.\n\n4. Runny-Ass Egg Yolks\n\nThe fuckery of breakfast foods. The consumption of runny egg yolks is done by people who eat after not washing their hands before leaving the bathroom. And watching \u201cthose people\u201d sopping their wheat toast and jelly into a salmonella smoothie like it\u2019s milk and cookies makes my stomach turn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho thought that THIS should be a thing, and why do people follow it?\n\n3. Gravy\n\nGravy originated in Europe during the 16th century. It was made from meat fat, where it was rendered, thickened and served with bread or potatoes. I can only guess that Dwights grew weary of eating seasonless meat and bland-ass potatoes. You can only do so much with a big-ass turkey leg and full side of beef or lamb, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack folks \u201cperfected\u201d gravy, however, with food that\u2019s already been seasoned and blessed by the hands of Black Jesus in your favorite auntie\u2019s kitchen; we don\u2019t really need it. It\u2019s a distraction ... and it\u2019s thick. As fuck.\n\nDo black people even eat shepherd\u2019s pie and Yorkshire pudding?\n\nBesides, making the other food on the plate, which DOESN\u2019T require gravy, wet ain\u2019t the business. Soggy-ass biscuits AIN\u2019T THE BUSINESS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Any Kind of Meat in Greens\n\nNegroes SWEAR by ham hocks, turkey necks or wings in greens.\n\n#ALLMEATSDONTMATTER\n\nI grew up eating meat in collards and turnip greens, and I\u2019ve always hated it. I don\u2019t want to have an MMA fighting match with bones and shit when I am trying to make a love connection in my belly between greens and cornbread.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBaby, what is you doing?\u201d\n\nMeat isn\u2019t needed to re-create a smoky or earthy flavor, which is why meat is, supposedly, added in the first place. The same result can be achieved by adding a spice like cumin. It works. TRUST ME! Remember, I competed on Chopped (in my head).\n\nAnd last but not least ... the food that can kick rocks for eternity unless served with colossal prawns, scallions, bacon pieces and cheese:\n\n1. Grits\n\nGrits are one of the most overrated and debated foods to grow on God\u2019s green earth, and they can rest eternally in the trash\u2014especially if you are dousing those shits with sugar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYeah, I said it.\n\nIt\u2019s a legitimate waste of perfectly savory corn on the cob. I mean, farina is what grits wanted to be but didn\u2019t quite pull off. The Ray J to Brandy, if you will, of ground milled grains.\n\nIt is the staple of every black mama\u2019s breakfast, and unfortunately, there are many black mamas, so as a kid ... I couldn\u2019t avoid them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI thank God for becoming an adult. I don\u2019t have to be subjected to eating this gah-bage ever again.

Carruth was a wide receiver with the Carolina Panthers and was casually dating Cherica Adams, who was seven months pregnant with Carruth\u2019s child, which he wanted her to abort. Adams refused. So Carruth smooth-talked her into going to see The Bone Collector. Adams didn\u2019t feel right. She called her mother, who told her not to go. She went anyway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the movie, Carruth wanted to go back to Adams\u2019 place. So off they went, Carruth in his white Ford Expedition and Adams following in her black BMW. Carruth came to an abrupt halt on an abandoned road when the hit men whom he hired pulled up alongside Adams and opened fire. Adams survived long enough to tell police that Carruth set the whole thing up. She died and her son, Chancellor Lee Adams, lived, but not without difficulties. For some time he didn\u2019t get enough oxygen and blood to his brain and was born with cerebral palsy.\n\nCarruth was sentenced to 18-24 years in prison for his role in Adams\u2019 death. Adams\u2019 mother, Saundra Adams, was given custody of her grandson and has raised him, taken him to endless doctor\u2019s appointments, stayed up countless hours watching him sleep.\n\n\n\nChancellor Lee Adams turned 18 in November. And his father, the father who wanted him dead, is set to get out of prison in October 2018.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now, after the role that he played in the murder of his son\u2019s mother, after the endless bills and constant worry that comes with raising a son with special needs, Rae Carruth, the same man who pulled off shortly after watching the men he hired dumping bullets into his baby mama\u2019s car, has written a letter to his son\u2019s grandmother, the mother of the woman he had killed, claiming that she is soiling his name.\n\n\n\nI WISH THAT THERE WERE A FONT THAT WE COULD ALL AGREE ON TO SYMBOLIZE THE HATE THAT I FEEL FOR THIS NIGGA\u2019S AUDACITY, BUT I WILL HAVE TO SETTLE FOR ALL CAPS.\n\n\n\nTHE NIGGADACITY OF THIS NIGGA!!!\n\n\n\nCarruth writes:\n\n\n\nMs. Adams, the story of how you lost your daughter; how Chancellor came into this world; and the way that he has gone on to endure, thrive and overachieve with you by his side is so heart wrenching and inspiring on its own, that there isn\u2019t any need for embellishment or lies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUmm, Rae Carruth, if Ms. Adams wants to make up all the lies in Lieville about you, guess what? You earned it! You triple-earned it. You deserve it [the Weeknd voice]. You don\u2019t have a truth anymore. You gave that up on Nov. 16, 1999. In fact, inmates shouldn\u2019t be allowed to write their victims or have their pleas for understanding publicized.\n\n\n\nAccording to Yahoo! Sports, Carruth has grown so frustrated with the stories about his character and statements made by Saundra Adams that he sent a letter to news stations so that he could point out that he has tried to reach out to her.\n\n\n\nYou can read his letter here, but I suggest that you don\u2019t bother. It starts with self-deprecating humility, only to be usurped by his inability to understand that he killed Adams\u2019 daughter and inflicted irreversible damage on his son. The letter alone should be grounds to hold him in prison. Some people aren\u2019t redeemable, and Rae Carruth still doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd if you haven\u2019t put your fist through your computer yet, just know that Carruth actually believes not only that he should be able to have a relationship with his son but that he\u2019s entitled to it.\n\n\n\nI want Rae Carruth to become the first inmate who refuses to leave prison for the good of us all. I want him to just volunteer to stay in prison for the good of his son. I want him to take a long walk off a short pier and never come back. I believe in rehabilitation, but this letter proves that Carruth hasn\u2019t changed; he\u2019s still the self-involved, narcissistic shit heel that thought he could orchestrate the murder of his child\u2019s mother and get away with it.\n\nCarruth son\u2019s lives on despite Carruth\u2019s best efforts to take his life, and he\u2019s doing just fine with his grandmother.

Adams was shot four times and died, while Carruth's son survived but was born with permanent brain damage.\n\nCarruth was sentenced to jail, and his son, Chancellor Lee Adams, was sent to live with Cherica Adams' mother, Saundra Adams.\n\nCarruth is set to get out of prison in 2018, and Saundra Adams wants his now 17-year-old son, Chancellor\u2014the same son Carruth tried to have killed\u2014to be one of the first people to greet him when he gets out.\n\n\"Maybe I can just talk to him and tell him some important things about what his son is doing,\" Saundra Adams told the Charlotte News & Observer, \"and where he is in his life.\"\n\nChancellor has only seen his father once, during a supervised prison visit when he was a toddler, and Carruth has never tried to contact either his son or Saundra Adams, the News & Observer reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Saundra Adams says she wants Carruth to know that she forgives him even though he has maintained his innocence throughout his time in jail.

They are charged with \u201cconspiracy to defraud the United States.\u201d In addition, three of the defendants have been charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, and five are charged with aggravated identity theft.\n\nCourt documents say that some of the defendants traveled to the United States or \u201ccommunicated with unwitting individuals associated with [President Trump\u2019s campaign] and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities.\u201d\n\nThese indictments provide the most detail yet about just who was involved in the activities meant to disrupt the U.S. political process.\n\nDuring a news conference Friday afternoon, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein\u2014who oversees Mueller\u2019s investigation\u2014said that the Russian efforts were \u201cinformation warfare\u201d with \u201cthe stated goal of spreading distrust against the candidates and the political system in general.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Rosenstein was also quick to make clear that there is \u201cno allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity,\u201d and \u201cno allegation that this activity actually altered the outcome of the 2016 election,\u201d which we can assume is his way of saying that the president and those involved in his campaign may not have colluded with the Russians.\n\nDonald Trump, on the other hand, was not as creative with his words.

Call me back at the God hour.\" You'd walk in and the entire wait staff would be past-their-prime rappers. Lady of Rage and Bahamadia would be the hostesses, Redman, U-God, and Black Rob the servers, Spliff Star, Grand Puba, and Amil the cooks, and Raekwon the Chef would be the actual head chef. The menu would be filled with nods to that era. Perhaps you might be in the mood for the Ol' Dirty Rice Bowl. Or maybe the Master Peas and Gravy. If really hungry, you could even get the What's Roast Beef? with your DMXtra Spicy Wing Dings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe skit wouldn't actually air on TV. After filming it, they'd realize its one of those instances where the idea behind the skit is better than the actual skit, and would cut it from the episode. But it would find a life on that season's DVD box set; included with other bits that didn't make the cut.\n\nOf course, White people seem intent on proving they're able to create realities far more absurd and ridiculous than any fiction. Which is why East Liberty \u2014 which used to be a Black Pittsburgh cultural nexus but is rapidly morphing into Yinzer Williamsburg \u2014 will soon be home to \"The Coop,\" which promises to be an \"urban, street style type of place\" serving fast casual fried chicken, according to Adam Kucenic (the owner). It will sit next to Muddy Waters, an oyster bar created by the same owner. And on Muddy Waters' other side will soon be another Kucenic creation: \"The Big Kahuna\" \u2014 a poke bowl restaurant with a distinctly Hawaiian feel.\n\nThat said, this is a free-ish country. (For the time being at least.) And there's nothing inherently wrong with a White person launching a fried chicken spot in a still mostly Black neighborhood. Plus, fried chicken's stereotypical connection to Black people has never not been the most peculiar stereotype ever because 1) loving fried chicken isn't a bad thing and 2) everyone loves fried chicken because 3) fried chicken is fucking awesome. If aliens ever discovered and landed on Earth, I'm one hundred percent certain their first Earth meal would be an extra crispy three piece and a biscuit. And then they'd forget about their whole interplanetary domination and colonization plan and just leave Earth and take all of our chickens with them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut remember way back when? When you first read the title of this piece, and said \"Wait. Um\u2026WTF?\" And then read some more just to make sure that the sheer absurdity of the title reflected a thing that was actually happening? Those feelings exist because you're aware of that historical connection between Black people and fried chicken. And you're also aware of the salmagundi of racially, culturally, and politically charged feelings that exist whenever Black residents and businesses are displaced or priced out of historically Black neighborhoods. And that context allowed you to immediately instinctively recognize that the concept behind that restaurant in that specific location is a terribly insensitive idea.\n\n\"Why\" you probably thought to yourself \"would anyone think that was cool?\"\n\nThat thought was likely followed by another thought:\n\n\"There was no friend or partner or whatever of the owner who heard about the idea and told him that maybe he should reconsider? That, even if his intentions where good, the optics and the reaction to those optics wouldn't be worth it? No one???\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhenever something like this happens, there's a tendency to dismiss the act as tone deaf. This is perhaps the most optimistic way of assessing these situations, as it implies that the person's heart was in the right place, but they're just oblivious to the factors and histories making their decision a gauche one. It's understandable why that would be the first reaction, as it's easier to regard people as ignorant and in need of an education instead of intentionally reckless. It just reflects a less dire feeling about humanity.\n\nThis concept was addressed on the University of Maryland panel Panama and I were on a couple weeks ago. The infamous #PepsiLivesMatter commercial was brought up. And while the conversation started with us collectively regarding it as tone deaf, someone (I forgot who) asked if this happening was more due to ignorance or arrogance. And the more we talked about it, the more we started leaning arrogance. That the type of people behind Pepsi's misfire know that what they're doing is vulturizing the culture, but just don't give a fuck.\n\nThis conversation came to mind yesterday, while reading a Facebook thread discussing this restaurant. In it, in was revealed that the owner's girlfriend \u2014 a woman named Diana Strekalovskaya (who also might have some ownership stake) \u2014 reacted to the pushback by telling those upset to \"do something good for the community you live in\" instead of complaining. She also apparently shared a link to her own Facebook page Monday on the \"liberal fantasy of cultural appropriation.\" Of course, it can be unwise to attempt to approximate a person's cultural sensitivities and conscience solely based on two days worth of social media activity. Maybe, between sharing subtly racist statuses, she's in the lab attempting to cure sickle cell or something. But there's nothing here to suggest that the owners should be given any benefit of the doubt. Hawking hipster hip-hop fried chicken in the gentrified hood isn't a clueless misstep but an intentional and shameless cash grab.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil, of course, they've made enough money off of the hood, and decide to go full Miley and bounce.

Carruth was a wide receiver with the Carolina Panthers and was casually dating Cherica Adams, who was seven months pregnant with Carruth\u2019s child, which he wanted her to abort. Adams refused. So Carruth smooth-talked her into going to see The Bone Collector. Adams didn\u2019t feel right. She called her mother, who told her not to go. She went anyway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the movie, Carruth wanted to go back to Adams\u2019 place. So off they went, Carruth in his white Ford Expedition and Adams following in her black BMW. Carruth came to an abrupt halt on an abandoned road when the hit men whom he hired pulled up alongside Adams and opened fire. Adams survived long enough to tell police that Carruth set the whole thing up. She died and her son, Chancellor Lee Adams, lived, but not without difficulties. For some time he didn\u2019t get enough oxygen and blood to his brain and was born with cerebral palsy.\n\nCarruth was sentenced to 18-24 years in prison for his role in Adams\u2019 death. Adams\u2019 mother, Saundra Adams, was given custody of her grandson and has raised him, taken him to endless doctor\u2019s appointments, stayed up countless hours watching him sleep.\n\n\n\nChancellor Lee Adams turned 18 in November. And his father, the father who wanted him dead, is set to get out of prison in October 2018.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now, after the role that he played in the murder of his son\u2019s mother, after the endless bills and constant worry that comes with raising a son with special needs, Rae Carruth, the same man who pulled off shortly after watching the men he hired dumping bullets into his baby mama\u2019s car, has written a letter to his son\u2019s grandmother, the mother of the woman he had killed, claiming that she is soiling his name.\n\n\n\nI WISH THAT THERE WERE A FONT THAT WE COULD ALL AGREE ON TO SYMBOLIZE THE HATE THAT I FEEL FOR THIS NIGGA\u2019S AUDACITY, BUT I WILL HAVE TO SETTLE FOR ALL CAPS.\n\n\n\nTHE NIGGADACITY OF THIS NIGGA!!!\n\n\n\nCarruth writes:\n\n\n\nMs. Adams, the story of how you lost your daughter; how Chancellor came into this world; and the way that he has gone on to endure, thrive and overachieve with you by his side is so heart wrenching and inspiring on its own, that there isn\u2019t any need for embellishment or lies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUmm, Rae Carruth, if Ms. Adams wants to make up all the lies in Lieville about you, guess what? You earned it! You triple-earned it. You deserve it [the Weeknd voice]. You don\u2019t have a truth anymore. You gave that up on Nov. 16, 1999. In fact, inmates shouldn\u2019t be allowed to write their victims or have their pleas for understanding publicized.\n\n\n\nAccording to Yahoo! Sports, Carruth has grown so frustrated with the stories about his character and statements made by Saundra Adams that he sent a letter to news stations so that he could point out that he has tried to reach out to her.\n\n\n\nYou can read his letter here, but I suggest that you don\u2019t bother. It starts with self-deprecating humility, only to be usurped by his inability to understand that he killed Adams\u2019 daughter and inflicted irreversible damage on his son. The letter alone should be grounds to hold him in prison. Some people aren\u2019t redeemable, and Rae Carruth still doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd if you haven\u2019t put your fist through your computer yet, just know that Carruth actually believes not only that he should be able to have a relationship with his son but that he\u2019s entitled to it.\n\n\n\nI want Rae Carruth to become the first inmate who refuses to leave prison for the good of us all. I want him to just volunteer to stay in prison for the good of his son. I want him to take a long walk off a short pier and never come back. I believe in rehabilitation, but this letter proves that Carruth hasn\u2019t changed; he\u2019s still the self-involved, narcissistic shit heel that thought he could orchestrate the murder of his child\u2019s mother and get away with it.\n\nCarruth son\u2019s lives on despite Carruth\u2019s best efforts to take his life, and he\u2019s doing just fine with his grandmother.

In this campaign season, though, Donald J. Trump has been sucking up so much of the election coverage, the rest of those of that dumb-dumb-diddy demo have been overlooked.\n\nThat\u2019s why I am so grateful to Jon Girodes, the Republican candidate for New York\u2019s 30th Senatorial District, who's doing his part to make sure we all remember there are many other racist buffoons worthy of our ridicule and condemnation.\n\nAs NBC 4 New York reports, Girodes planned for an event in Harlem, which, I\u2019m sure in his mind, was some sort of attempt at black outreach. However, if you took a random poll of black folks, most would hear this plan and say something to the effect of, \u201cBitch, you got us f\u2014ked up.\u201d And he does.\n\nWhat\u2019s the plan? Well, per an email Girodes sent out to NBC 4: \u201cI'm hosting an event in Harlem which will be in front of the state building in a few weeks. We will [donate] Kool Aid, KFC and watermelons to the public on 125th street in Harlem. Please join us to help the community.\u201d\n\nOf course, the image for this proposed event features Martin Luther King Jr., this type's personal get-out-of-\u201cThat\u2019s racist!\u201d card. Bless his ignorant, clueless heart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs someone who walks past that building just about every single day, I\u2019m trying to envision what it might look like to see some Republican stroll up to the Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building and more or less offer a trio of stereotypes to black people.\n\n\u201cWhat I think is anyone who gives free food to people is doing them a favor,\u201d Girodes explained to NBC 4. \u201cGet a bunch of people who say it\u2019s offensive and let me go into their neighborhood and give it out for free and see if they take it.\u201d\n\nFine, I\u2019ll admit that if I just so randomly stumbled onto someone handing out chicken wings and fried fish sandwiches, it might initially pique my interest. No one will shame me for a love of either thing. That said, who goes to Harlem and offers KFC? There is a Popeyes on 116th, 125th and 145th streets. How are you shimmying into Harlem with KFC? No one wants that, you silly, likely no-seasoning-using man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re going to stereotype us, at least do so more productively.\n\nThen again, fried chicken is beloved by all, so to couple that with watermelon and Kool-Aid is pretty damn offensive. You want black votes, so you give black voters high cholesterol and \u201cthe sugar\u201d? For the love of God, it is National Diabetes Month.\n\nInterestingly enough, on several days throughout the week, there is a black woman who owns a solar-powered truck that serves delicious oyster po\u2019boys, shrimp and grits, and fried fish right outside that very building in front of which Girodes wants to troll black people. I\u2019ve talked to her before, and she\u2019s repeatedly explained to patrons that she\u2019s not using the truck as a means to one day get a restaurant. She\u2019s from Harlem and she\u2019s seen the rents go up over the years. For her, the truck is a way to do something she loves in a cost-effective and forward-leaning way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsidering that Republicans pretend to care so much about small-business people, a more sincere politician might have reached out to someone like her to try to sell his little shtick about lower taxes and other tenets of conservative ideology. Speaking of higher rent, Girodes is a real estate agent and, per the NBC 4 article about this whole ridiculous idea, possibly a shady one. One woman told the station that she had paid a refundable $750 deposit to rent his luxury apartment on 42nd Street. However, she said that when she backed out of the deal, he kept her money.\n\nWhether or not he\u2019s a crafty queen is up for readers to decide, but a few things are certain. One, he\u2019s not really \u2019bout that life in terms of black outreach. Two, he\u2019s your garden-variety silly, repugnant Republican. This is Girodes' second time running for this office, and ideally, he\u2019ll lose even worse than he did before.\n\nI\u2019ll be sure to sport a Kool-Aid smile if he does.\n\nMichael Arceneaux hails from Houston, lives in Harlem and praises Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s name wherever he goes.

Bannon was asked specific questions that had been negotiated between the White House and the House\u2019s lead counsel.\n\nBannon had been subpoenaed by the committee on Jan. 16 but managed to postpone the subpoena deadline three times as the White House and House lawyers negotiated which questions he could answer without the White House invoking executive privilege to prevent him from testifying.\n\nDemocrat Rep. Adam Schiff of California, ranking member of the committee, told reporters: \u201cThe only questions he would answer were questions that had been scripted, literally scripted for him by the White House. Whenever we sought to probe anything beyond the four corners of the specific wording of the question, he refused to answer. That\u2019s not how executive privilege works.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, lawmakers said that continued noncooperation on Bannon\u2019s part could result in the committee taking steps to hold him in contempt of Congress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe claims of executive privilege will be looked into by committee member Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), who said that he will work with House Speaker Paul Ryan and House lawyers to determine whether contempt proceedings would be appropriate.\n\nSo the White House was able to script what Bannon told the House Intelligence Committee, but it wasn\u2019t able to do that for Bannon\u2019s meetings with Mueller.\n\nWhich leaves us to wonder what Bannon may have told Mueller. Did he roll over on his former friend and boss? The way he slobbered on the mic for Michael Wolff for the freeski would lead one to believe that under fear of some type of legal recourse against him, he may have done the same with Mueller.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, to be a fly on the wall for that.\n\nI need Mueller to drop the bomb already. We\u2019ve been waiting long enough. Yes, I want the investigation to be thorough and to yield the type of fruit that might help us get Trump out of here, but I also want them to hurry the hell up.\n\nEnough is enough.\n\nSo, what do you think Bannon spilled the beans on?

It was a speech seemingly intended to touch the heart of the next shooter out there who apparently just needs a hug in order to not murder his classmates.\n\nMind you, if this wasn\u2019t the most divisive president in the history of presidents, then maybe his entreaties for peace and love would make a difference, but he is who he is, so his pleas don\u2019t hold weight and they won\u2019t change anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most glaring part of the speech came at the end, when the president pledged that America must \u201ctackle the difficult issue of mental health.\u201d He didn\u2019t say \u201cguns\u201d once in his speech. Trump took pains to make no mention of guns. If Tim Gunn had jumped in front of him, ripped off his well-tailored sleeves, flexed and screamed, \u201cWhat do you think of these??\u201d Trump would still have found a way to say, \u201cHow\u2019s that mental health going?\u201d\n\nMental health has become the ultimate red herrng for Republicans who don\u2019t want to talk about guns no matter who gets shot, or how bloody or egregious and avoidable the crime may have been. The country is full of people with \u201cmental health problems,\u201d and they aren\u2019t shooting up schools every week. You know who is shooting up schools and nightclubs and office buildings every week? People who are legally allowed to buy AR-15s. Fix that problem and maybe we can stop with the disingenuous chorus of tweets citing \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d every 60 hours.\n\nAlas, we know that Trump won\u2019t do anything; nor will Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell or House Speaker Paul Ryan.

And now Gina Rodriguez, a manager for Daniels\u2014why she has a manager I will never know\u2014is informing the press that Daniels is ready to talk.\n\n\u201cEverything is off now, and Stormy is going to tell her story,\u201d Rodriguez told the New York Daily News.\n\n\n\nDaniels has juiced the pulp out of this affair with the president, and while I don\u2019t blame her for getting her coins, I\u2019m growing tired of her story. We\u2014those of us who didn\u2019t vote for Trump\u2014know that Daniels\u2019 story is true. We know that the president of Loaf-n-Jug, Tenn., ain\u2019t shit. We knew it before he ran for office. So hearing that he chased Daniels around the room in his \u201ctighty whities\u201d before they had generic, geriatric sex isn\u2019t shocking; it\u2019s vomit-inducing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe Daniels should just stick to her \u201cMake America Horny Again\u201d tour and starring in films like Good Will Humping because unless she\u2019s going to tell America that the president is secretly a black woman who wears a satin cap before bed, his base isn\u2019t going to move, and therefore, Daniels\u2019 time in the spotlight is coming to an end.", "keywords": ["tell", "stormy", "know", "actress", "care", "trump", "cares", "affair", "daniels", "president", "dont", "talk", "donald", "unless", "going", "porn"], "polarity": -0.003256164125729334, "subjectivity": 0.487982307547525},

We all know it\u2019s been hard to get over Barack: He took America to meet his family in Kenya, brought some flowers for the National Portrait Gallery; we all know he was a good guy and America misses him.\n\nSeriously, though, what nation in its right mind would want to stay with a leader who is constantly threatening the press, is mired in corruption and built his career on racism, and who was not only accused of rape but also led chants of \u201cBurn the bitch\u201d against his political opponent? All of this sounds a lot like Trump, and you\u2019d think America would say \u201cBoy, bye\u201d to that kind of leader\u2014but we\u2019re still playing \u201che picked me for less than the popular vote\u201d with President Crotch Grabber.\n\nBelieve it or not, the aforementioned actions are by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and/or South African President Jacob Zuma. But unlike the United States, those two nations have had enough and told their leaders that they\u2019ll be sleeping on the couch until the divorce is final. Who knew it would take two second world nations with a bit of backbone to remind America of how dating while democratic is supposed to get done?\n\nOn Tuesday, South Africa\u2019s ruling national party, the African National Congress, called for President Jacob Zuma to step down by Valentine\u2019s Day or face a no-confidence vote. And you know what? He did it. You know that old anthem \u201cWhen a Nation\u2019s Fed Up\u201d? Well, Zuma had this coming to him.\n\nFrom 2005 to the present day, Jacob Zuma has been on one. He\u2019s spent the last decade fighting off 783 counts of bribery and racketeering from an illegal arms deal. He was charged with raping an HIV-positive daughter of a political ally, then claimed that he \u201ctook a shower\u201d after sex to make sure he didn\u2019t have HIV. Then he went outside the courtroom and led chants of \u201cBurn the bitch.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen he \u201cconsensually\u201d knocked up another friend\u2019s daughter. A friend who happened to be chairman of the South African World Cup committee and owner of the popular Orlando Pirates soccer team. That would be like Trump knocking up Patriots owner Robert Kraft\u2019s daughter, then turning around and asking him to promote Boston as the next Summer Olympics site. Zuma did most of this after he was elected to office in 2009. Yes, South Africa was ready to swipe left.\n\nSince Valentine\u2019s Day seems to be the perfect opportunity to cut out of a bad relationship while you still can, the Israeli government has followed the South African example.\n\nOn Tuesday, Israeli police announced that they had \u201csufficient evidence\u201d to charge Prime Minister Benjamin \u201cBibi\u201d Netanyahu with bribery, fraud and \u201cbreach of trust.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNetanyahu, who has been in office since \u201909, tried to buy off a newspaper that was critical of him, authorities charge. Then, in exchange for expensive gifts and favors, he arranged for visas and tried to push through a massive tax cut for Arnon Milchan, a big-time Hollywood producer ( movies like Pretty Woman, JFK and 12 Years a Slave) who wanted to move to Israel, officials say.\n\nHow did Bibi get caught and who ratted him out? Yair Lapid, leader of the Yesh Atid party that is part of Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition, dropped a dime on the prime minister and has publicly asked him to step down from power. When asked by the press why he stood up to Netanyahu\u2019s pressure, he said:\n\nIn this instance as in other instances, Yesh Atid was the last barrier against government corruption, in the face of politicians occupied solely with themselves and their own well-being.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBang, bang! Shots fired!\n\nCan you imagine House Speaker Paul Ryan or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ever flipping for special counsel Robert Mueller because the Republican Party was the last barrier against corruption? Can you imagine the Republican Party standing up to Trump\u2019s various wife-beating, sexually assaulting cronies and calling for their removal? Of course not. These guys think #MeToo is a call-and-response for who gets to kiss Trump\u2019s butt at the next staff meeting.\n\nIn high school, we\u2019re taught that American presidents are kept in check by more checks and balances than a block of Wells Fargos, but nobody is doing anything in America about Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet, less democratic states like South Africa have managed to remove a corrupt leader, and in Israel, even if Netanyahu puts up a fight, it\u2019s clear that members of his own coalition are willing to hold him accountable if he strays too far.\n\nAmerica used to be savage like that. The Senate voted on Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment right before Valentine\u2019s Day, over a blow job. Yet somehow, the nation has lost its way with the current trash president, while others act like the nation we used to be.\n\nOn Wednesday, the ANC bought Zuma a nice Nando\u2019s gift certificate and a one-way ticket to GTFOH-istan. In Israel, if Netanyahu somehow survives the charges against him, there\u2019s no chance he\u2019ll be his party\u2019s leader by the 2019 elections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerica should totally join the Break Up With Your Terrible Leader Club today.

I then began to see alcohol as something to be savored and experienced.\n\n\n\nThis is especially true for brown liquor. Because only with the brown nectar from the gods can one find such an intense depth and density of flavor. It is, to my mind, this intensity that makes brown liquor uniquely suited to certain songs. In fact, there are songs that, upon first listen, I can immediately identify as \u201csonic brown liquor.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn order for a track to qualify as a \u201cbrown liquor\u201d song, it must meet certain criteria. 1) It must have a pronounced bass line; 2) this bass line must be contrasted with an ethereal harmony; and 3) the sonic tension between these juxtapositions must evoke a mood that is either libidinous or mournful in nature.\n\n\n\nMany songs produce this feeling. Keith Sweat and Gerald Levert are two men who built entire careers off of an ability to make songs that would make it onto a \u201cbrown liquor\u201d playlist, but below, I offer 10 of the best brown-liquor songs of all time.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. \u201cTurn Off the Lights\u201d by Teddy Pendergrass\n\nTeddy specializes in telling his lover what to do. He has a number of songs with commanding titles like \u201cClose the Door\u201d and \u201cCome Go With Me,\u201d but \u201cTurn Off the Lights\u201d is Pendergrass\u2019 magnum opus. I recommend you pair this with a hot-oil massage and a Jameson on the rocks.\n\n\n\n2. \u201cI\u2019d Rather Be With You\u201d by Bootsy Collins\n\nPlayful and whimsical, this song off the 1976 album Stretchin\u2019 Out in Bootsy\u2019s Rubber Band is a masterpiece of bass. One might miss what he is up to sonically if one listens only to the lyrics and the way he delivers them with tongue firmly in cheek, but the former bass player for James Brown and Parliament Funkadelic puts on a guitar clinic with this track. I suggest pairing this song with Jack Daniels, ginger ale and a lemon wedge.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \u201cMe and Those Dreamin\u2019 Eyes of Mine\u201d by D\u2019Angelo\n\nOne could forget that D\u2019Angelo\u2019s first album is a masterpiece of mood. It\u2019s not the earthy soul that he exhibits in Voodoo and Black Messiah but, rather, a polished entry into the then-burgeoning movement we later called neo-soul. \u201cMe and Those Dreamin\u2019 Eyes of Mine\u201d is a standout track that perfectly captures the feelings of longing that drinking too much brown can inspire. This is best accompanied with Crown Royal on ice.\n\n\n\n4. \u201cOh Girl\u201d by Raphael Saadiq\n\nSaadiq\u2019s genius has never been fully appreciated. Who else could make a tuba work on an R&B track? \u201cOh Girl\u201d (not the remix featuring Jay-Z) is the man from Oakland, Calif., at the height of his powers. A throwback in sound design and songwriting structure to 1950s and \u201960s R&B, \u201cOh Girl\u201d is the perfect song to play in the background as you sip a Macallan Fine Oak 18-year-old scotch.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On\u201d by Marvin Gaye\n\nBeing black in America is enough to drive one to the bottle. Some days one wonders if things will ever get better. Ponder the existential crisis of Du Boisian double consciousness while sipping Bulleit on ice.\n\n\n\n6. \u201cAnything\u201d by Janet Jackson\n\nThis is the definitive Janet Jackson slow jam. Per Son of Baldwin, \u201cAnything was Janet channeling her best Isley Brothers. ... You can hear it in her phrasings. Listen to the way she says \u2018I\u2019 for example. She puts that stank on it and turns it into \u2018Yi.\u2019 That\u2019s a classic Ron Isley interpretation, made specifically for the bedroom. Janet updated it by adding her trademark honey-harmonies (a phrase coined by writer Danyel Smith to describe the sound of \u2018I Get Lonely\u2019) in the background. Smooth AF. Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis added that hypnotic pulse and there you have it: folks ready to give up \u201cAnything\u201d in the act of lovemaking.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI suggest you pair this with Basil Hayden \u2026 neat.\n\n\n\n7. \u201cCause I Love You\u201d by Lenny Williams\n\nBefore Keith Sweat crooned through his nasal cavity, before Drake made his name an alternative adjective for a herb, Lenny Williams set the standard for how to be a begging-ass nigga. This is the ultimate \u201cWhy don\u2019t you love me how I love you?\u201d song. I recommend you pair this with Hennessy White, a straw hat and a linen suit complete with sandal shoes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. \u201cCan\u2019t Hide Love\u201d by Earth, Wind & Fire\n\nThe title says it all. The closing harmonic vocalizations are enough to put one in touch with the divine. Listening to this while sipping Gentleman Jack is a transcendental experience.\n\n\n\n9. \u201cSweet Love\u201d by Anita Baker\n\nI need to come clean. I only recently learned to appreciate the artistry of Anita Baker. While I don\u2019t think I will ever listen to her music unendingly for fun, I do appreciate the caramel-like smoothness of her sound. This is a Hennessy song. It may be THE Hennessy song.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. \u201cMarvins Room\u201d by Drake\n\nDrunk confessions via a late-night phone call to a woman who has found love is the Drakiest of Drake moves. The melody, lyrics and bass line of the song all come together to create a soulfully mournful and distinctly millennial brown liquor mood. I suggest you pair this with Crown Royal Apple, the official drink of black folks who want to drink brown liquor but don\u2019t want to taste the alcohol.", "keywords": ["track", "best", "janet", "brown", "bass", "songs", "suggest", "pair", "liquor", "song", "love"], "polarity": 0.206978021978022, "subjectivity": 0.503095238095238},

As the Washington Post reports, the 32-year-old carpenter grew concerned about the safety of his 3-year-old twins and 1-year old son. The Post notes that the early-morning sighting capped \u201ca string of attempted intrusions\u201d into his home in recent weeks.\n\nSo Rodriguez did what many might do when confronted with a stranger on their property: He called the cops.\n\nThe officers did find the trespasser but didn\u2019t arrest him because they had no probable cause, police say. They did end up arresting Rodriguez. As CNN reports, after asking for his ID, cops discovered that he had an outstanding warrant they believed to be criminal. Not long after calling the police to investigate a possible intruder, Rodriguez, who is an undocumented immigrant, found himself in the back of a squad car.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened next, according to the Post:\n\nRodriguez overheard an officer discussing by speakerphone with a voice on the other end of the line. It was Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Cortes said. \u201cDo you want us to bring him to you?\u201d the officer asked, Rodriguez later recalled. \u201cThat would be great,\u201d the voice responded. Minutes later, the officers left Rodriguez at a nearby ICE field office. Rodriguez was shackled and later taken to the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, one of the largest detention facilities in the nation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it turns out, the warrant wasn\u2019t criminal at all. According to the Tukwila Police Department\u2019s own admissions, it misinterpreted the nature of the warrant against Rodriguez. It was actually an administrative warrant, related to a missed court hearing from 2004, when authorities in Texas discovered that he had entered the country illegally.\n\nRodriguez\u2019s lawyer, Luis Cortes Romero, told the Post that his client never received the notice to attend the mandatory court meeting, but missing it triggered a removal order.\n\nThis makes Rodriguez\u2019s arrest, essentially, a mistake. The Tukwila PD confirmed that it \u201cdoes not respond to U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement requests to detain individuals on their behalf.\u201d The only reason Rodriguez was arrested was that his administrative warrant appeared like a criminal one in the National Criminal Information Center database.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite this, Immigration and Customs Enforcement now refuses to release Rodriguez, according to his lawyer. He maintains that his client has no criminal record. Rodriguez could be deported within a matter of days, leaving his young children without a father.\n\n\n\nThe arrest falls in line with one of the more troubling trends of the Donald Trump administration. Arrests of noncriminal undocumented immigrants have skyrocketed in the last year. The Washington Post found that ICE had detained 37,734 undocumented \u201cnoncriminal\u201d immigrants in 2017. This was twice the number arrested in Barack Obama\u2019s final year as president.\n\n\n\nAside from the obvious concerns, of upending the lives of thousands of people and disrupting families and communities, the immigrant crackdown has also triggered a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on crime reporting across the country. Undocumented immigrants who are the victims of crimes like robbery and sexual assault have refused to report them for fear of being handed over to ICE, according to police and immigration advocates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Police Department, which says it has \u201cworked tirelessly\u201d to develop and maintain relations with its large immigrant and refugee population, says that it will not be responding to administrative warrants from ICE going forward.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Rodriguez\u2019s lawyer has requested a stay of removal for the carpenter on humanitarian grounds, the Post reports. He\u2019s the sole provider for his partner and their three children.", "keywords": ["calling", "immigrant", "warrant", "criminal", "according", "help", "faces", "reports", "undocumented", "ice", "deportation", "post", "rodriguez", "tukwila"], "polarity": 0.0340531561461794, "subjectivity": 0.40299003322259136},

Later, Nicks called Prince because she wanted to confess to him that she had \u201ckinda ripped off his song.\u201d Prince being Prince, he showed up at her place, sprinkled his purple magic all over her synthesizers for about 25 minutes and then left.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe spoiled me for every band I\u2019ve ever had because nobody can exactly re-create\u2014not even with two piano players\u2014what Prince did all by his little self,\u201d Nicks told music journalist Timothy White in 1991. Prince\u2019s contribution is uncredited, but the two superstars did agree to split the royalties 50-50, because even musical geniuses can\u2019t live off of high praise and thank-you notes.\n\n\n\n2. \u201cLike a Prayer,\u201d Madonna\n\nLike a Prayer, the album, actually features a duet between the Queen of Pop and the Purple One called \u201cLove Song.\u201d But Prince also laid down some guitar tracks while in the studio. According to Madonna producer Patrick Leonard, the guitar distortions heard at the beginning of an extended version of \u201cLike a Prayer\u201d were played by Prince. That version isn\u2019t heard on the album, but it can be heard in the controversial video that got Pepsi in a lot of trouble, and which shows that the soda giant has been making bad choices involving privileged white women for quite some time now.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \u201cYou\u2019re My Love,\u201d Kenny Rogers\n\nPrince wrote songs for many artists across all genres, and since country music is black music\u2014despite what fans of the Country Music Awards might think\u2014it isn\u2019t too surprising that he wrote a track for country superstar Kenny Rogers. Using the pen name \u201cJoey Coco,\u201d Prince wrote the 1986 ballad after Rogers contacted him through a mutual friend about getting Prince to write him a song.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cManic Monday,\u201d the Bangles\n\nPrince did love him some pen names, and this hit single was credited to \u201cChristopher,\u201d as in Christopher Tracy, his character from Under a Cherry Moon. The track was initially intended for Apollonia 6, but Prince sent the song to the Bangles, reportedly because he had a thing for Bangles guitarist-vocalist Susanna Hoffs. It would become the band\u2019s first big hit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. \u201cSugar Walls,\u201d Sheena Easton\n\nBefore Prince got ahold of her, Sheena Easton was singing sugary pop tunes about morning trains and being a modern girl. After Prince, she was singing a different tune \u2014specifically, the sexually suggestive \u201cSugar Walls,\u201d which ended up being listed on the \u201cFilthy 15\u201d\u2014the songs with the raunchiest, most violent or drug-fueled lyrics, according to Tipper Gore\u2019s Parents Music Resource Center, the force behind the \u201cparental advisory\u201d sticker. The Filthy 15 also featured another sexually explicit song by Prince that drove Gore to create the PMRC in the first place. Easton would later join Prince on another track, \u201cU Got the Look,\u201d from 1987\u2019s Sign o\u2019 the Times.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. \u201cI Feel for You,\u201d Chaka Khan\n\nPrince wrote this classic R&B hit for Patrice Rushen, who rejected the track along with \u201cI Wanna Be Your Lover\u201d (I wonder how Rushen, who had a decent career, feels now about not jumping on the Prince bandwagon when she had the chance?), so he included the song on his 1979 self-titled album. In 1984, Chaka Khan released an album of the same name and, in a rare feat, produced a song that outshone the origin. Of course, Chaka did have a little help from legendary rapper Melle Mel, who dropped that catchy little verse on the opening of the track, which perfectly took advantage of the growing rise of hip-hop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. \u201cHow Come You Don\u2019t Call Me,\u201d Alicia Keys\n\nHere again is another example of a female singer taking a Prince tune and turning it into a hit (of course, the most famous example of this is Sinead O\u2019Connor\u2019s cover of \u201cNothing Compares 2 U\u201d). Based on Prince\u2019s \u201cHow Come U Don\u2019t Call Me Anymore?,\u201d which first appeared on a compilation album in 1993, Key\u2019s single appeared on her debut album, Songs in A Minor, in 2001.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. \u201cWhen You Were Mine,\u201d Cyndi Lauper\n\nThis Prince-penned song appeared on Lauper\u2019s debut album, 1983\u2019s She So Unusual. Lauper, who, like Prince, had a unique musical persona that confounded and defied expectations, was a longtime friend of the Royal One, who gave her business advice back in the day when they were stars coming up in the \u201980s; he even secretly attended her concerts.", "keywords": ["track", "music", "little", "didnt", "song", "probably", "single", "know", "stand", "songs", "wrote", "princes", "touched", "prince", "album", "magic"], "polarity": 0.09200669700669702, "subjectivity": 0.47079161579161594},

Perhaps you\u2019ve never seen the original Roots or have not fully memorized the entire catalog of Luther Vandross. When those around you discover this lapse in your black cultural conditioning, the threat is issued: \u201cWe\u2019re going to revoke your black card.\u201d That is, your inclusion in the collective black community is going to be rescinded.\n\nMine has been threatened for a number of reasons: I haven\u2019t seen every episode of Good Times; I didn\u2019t like hot sauce until I was in my mid-30s; I think John Singleton\u2019s Baby Boy is an earnest yet overrated film\u2014and those are the minor offenses. There are three main reasons why my black card has almost been revoked, and one reason it\u2019ll never be taken away.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not a fan of Anita Baker\u2019s music.\n\nI see that she is talented. I recognize and respect her unique voice. Her music just comes off as so damn \u2026 old. The lush instrumentals and, in my eyes, excessive vocalizations rub me the wrong way. I don\u2019t begrudge anyone who is a fan; it\u2019s just not for me.\n\nWhen listening to Anita Baker, I feel as if I should be wearing a leather baseball hat while rocking a velour sweatsuit and Stacy Adams shoes. I also feel the need to say things like, \u201cWhat y\u2019all young bucks know about this?\u201d and comment on how a person wearing a finely tailored suit with matching shoes is \u201csuited and booted\u201d while I make my way to the driveway to play basketball in the aforementioned dress shoes. Y\u2019all can have Baker. I validate her as a national treasure; I just don\u2019t want to listen to her music.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPopeyes Chicken is overrated.\n\nI didn\u2019t say \u201cbad\u201d\u2014I said \u201coverrated.\u201d Look, if I want some fried chicken, more often than not I\u2019m going to visit a local black church and buy one of their fried-chicken dinners. They sell them every other week, and it\u2019ll probably come with green beans, mashed potatoes and a roll. If that fails, I\u2019ll go to Popeyes. Not because it\u2019s great\u2014just because it\u2019s there.\n\nMy theory about why Popeyes is so popular is simple: Black folks are able to get the flavor of hot sauce on decently seasoned chicken without actually having to put hot sauce on the chicken. Now, to be sure, there are many who still put hot sauce on Popeyes spicy chicken, but I hold to my hypothesis.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI hate Tyler Perry\u2019s films.\n\nHate-watching is defined as watching something for the sake of the enjoyment one derives from mocking or criticizing it. I\u2019ve seen every single Tyler Perry movie (save for Madea\u2019s Christmas\u2014I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to sit through that one), and I\u2019ve hated every one except Daddy\u2019s Little Girls\u2014and that was only because of the all-consuming charisma of Idris Elba.\n\nPerry\u2019s films are not just bad; they are case studies in horrific filmmaking. He uses good actors, but he fails them with poor editing, bad scripts and one-dimensional characters. He is an auteur in the worst-possible way: His films are almost uniformly bad. His moralizing is also off-putting. One need only watch Temptation to see how this impulse hurts his filmmaking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile my articulation of the above has often put my black card in danger, it has never successfully been taken away, for one simple reason:\n\n\n\nBlack people are not monolithic.\n\nContrary to white supremacist narratives about what it means to be black, we, as a people, do not all like the same things. There are black comic book readers, like Deborah Whaley, who were once on the margins of black culture but are now in the mainstream. There is the Afropunk band Rough Francis, who took up the mantle of the underappreciated Detroit black proto-punk band Death. There is even the brilliant Chance the Rapper, who brings his nerdy, gospel-influenced sensibilities to bear upon postmodern hip-hop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlackness is no one thing. We are a complex, beautiful people. The next time someone tries to take away your black card, ask that person if he or she has read Frantz Fanon or W.E.B. Du Bois or Ralph Ellison or Richard Wright or Kiese Laymon, or if he or she has seen Charles Burnett\u2019s Killer of Sheep or Julie Dash\u2019s Daughters of the Dust. You\u2019ll discover that we all have cultural blind spots\u2014or things about which we disagree. We should celebrate our variations instead of seeking uniformity \u2026 unless you don\u2019t like Prince. Then we\u2019ve got problems.\n\nLawrence Ware is a progressive writer in a conservative state.

The Trump administration temporarily expanded this guest-worker program in 2017 while restricting other avenues of legal immigration, including the H-1B program for high-skilled workers. The Trump Organization is exactly the kind of company that relies on the H-2B visa program for low-skilled workers. Vox reviewed recruiting files submitted to the US Department of Labor for two Trump properties in Florida (including Mar-a-Lago) and one in New York from the start of 2016 through the end of 2017. In that period, hiring managers said they were able to find and hire only one qualified American worker \u2014 a cook \u2014 for 144 open positions for servers, cooks, housekeepers, and bartenders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Vox, all of the businesses owned by Trump appeared to suffer from the same issue: They\u2019d post a job listing and then no one applied or was skilled enough to do the work.\n\n\n\nThe hiring manager at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla., noted that only seven U.S. workers applied for jobs. Mar-a-Lago jobs allowed workers to make anywhere from $10.33 per hour for housekeepers to $13.43 for cooks and $11.88 for servers (no tips).\n\n\n\nApparently, no Americans wanted to work at Trump\u2019s Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., property, as Vox reports that no one applied for any of the available positions.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Daily News notes that after the Trump administration got the cap raised on H-2B visas, \u201cthree days later Trump properties put in a request to bring on 76 guest workers.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere is no magic here.", "keywords": ["jobs", "guest", "hired", "believe", "properties", "workers", "maga", "program", "actually", "trump", "foreign", "vox", "employees", "american", "h2b", "trumps", "needed"], "polarity": 0.09428970152654365, "subjectivity": 0.4257651705020125},

The way it would work is that those on government assistance would receive less money on their EBT cards, and in return they\u2019d be sent a box of items including \u201cshelf-stable milk, ready to eat cereals, pasta, peanut butter, beans and canned fruit and vegetables.\u201d The boxes would not include fresh fruits or vegetables.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost important, recipients would receive canned meat.

When it was revealed that both the FBI and White House officials knew about the allegations against both men, it raised questions as to why they were allowed to keep their jobs and whether or not this administration enables abusers.\n\nIn a White House press briefing Monday afternoon, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders asserted that the White House takes the allegations \u201cvery seriously\u201d and believes that they should be \u201cinvestigated thoroughly.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe president and the entire administration take domestic violence very seriously and believe all allegations need to be investigated thoroughly.

Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound like a man who supports victims of domestic violence.

Trump obstructed justice to suppress the tape of him splish-splashing naked in a puddle of post-orgy Soviet urine like an albino walrus wallowing in a pool of off-brand apple juice. Authorities will reveal how he rigged the election, stuffed his pocket full of rubles and manipulated the Justice Department to cover it up.\n\n\n\nEven worse ... none of it will matter.\n\nWhen dissecting the authoritarian-esque rise of the lace-front-wearing chief executive, pundits strain to explain why Trump is bulletproof. They point to partisanship, conservatism and the recently discovered phenomenon of working-class white oppression as the reason that 83 percent of white Republicans and 47 percent of all white people still approve of the job he is doing as president.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s legislative failures, unrepentant racism, and unfortunate allergy to facts and truth, The Donald\u2019s devotees will not admit that he has committed a single misstep. He has convinced congressional Republicans, Fox News watchers and people who consider Nick Cannon \u201ctoo urban\u201d that verifiable evidence means nothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor them, thousands of media outlets have formed a secret cabal to perpetuate fake news. The FBI, CIA, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and the mythical \u201cdeep state\u201d have all manufactured his decadeslong connection with Russia. Random women have all made up similar lies about his sexual misdeeds. Even science and math have joined the party to misstate his popular vote totals, his poll numbers and how many people showed up to his inauguration. There is only one way to explain why logic and reason no longer apply to the president:\n\nDonald Trump is a God.\n\nTrumpism has evolved from a political ideology into a religion with an unerring tyrannical messiah at the center of it all. He is no longer a politician, he is a religious figure, and admitting it is the first step to understanding the cultlike devotion to Donald Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Gospel According to Trump\n\nI do not make this claim without acknowledging the fact that I, too, have made a god out of a mere mortal. Even before I knew or understood what religion or a Bible was, my mother was my first deity, and her words might as well have been written in red in a religious text.\n\nLike Trump\u2019s acolytes toward him, when it came to my mother, I believed that whatever came out of her mouth was the unadulterated truth. In the rare instances that I questioned her, she responded to my queries with the same reasoning offered by the president or a Baptist preacher forced to answer a biblical inconsistency:\n\nBecause she said so.\n\nWhen someone points out that immigrants are less likely to commit a crime, that white men commit more acts of terrorism or that the economy is a product of Obama\u2019s policies, Trump bypasses reason and doubles down on rhetoric. Even though net immigration has been negative for more than 10 years, Trump\u2019s followers believe that kicking out Mexicans and Muslims will magically transform America into a utopian paradise in the same way that some Christians show up on Sundays to pay 10 percent of their income to an already wealthy pastor to buy a seat in the VIP section of the afterlife.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s fans dismiss anyone who questions as an unholy blasphemer using their carnal mind. Nothing has to make sense. He said it. That\u2019s enough.\n\nThus sayeth Trump.\n\nTrump Is Great and Worthy of Praise\n\nWhen talking about Trump\u2019s disciples, we often imagine poor whites in the South and Appalachia who haven\u2019t had anyone so blond and worthy of reverence since Rick Flair hung up his unitard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even learned men have converted to the cult of Trump, as his Cabinet meetings have become eerily similar to the last supper or the final Kool-Aid brunch in Jonestown, Guyana, replete with seemingly intelligent people showering him with praise. He even opens every meeting with praise and worship devotional service:\n\nHe is no longer campaigning, but like other religious figures, Trump travels around the country holding tent revivals and rallies whipping crowds into Holy Ghost-like frenzies when he preaches. He\u2019s not doing this for votes. He\u2019s just spreading his gospel to the masses, calling NFL players \u201csons of bitches\u201d and explaining how he could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue in New York City and shoot a man, all to thunderous applause.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe entire Republican Party has joined the church, including the seemingly sane apostle Paul Ryan, who gushed over Trump\u2019s \u201cexquisite leadership.\u201d Ben Carson even thanked his lord and savior for Donald Trump in a recent White House prayer.\n\nLater this year, Trump will go all out and order the U.S. armed forces to honor him with a formal military parade. The Navy SEAL who killed Osama bin Laden criticized the plans for a formally attired military display as \u201cThird World bullshit,\u201d but those of us who have attended a black church know that the choir always marches in on the pastor\u2019s anniversary.\n\nTrump Is a Miracle-Maker\n\n\u201cHe performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.\u201d \u2014Job 5:9\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyone examining the cult of Trump cannot ignore his incredible record of accomplishments:\n\n\n\nThere might be some people who fact-check these claims and discover that none of them are true, but those people aren\u2019t true believers. When members of his congregation casually dismiss truth as \u201cfake news,\u201d they are essentially accusing the press of being false prophets trying to smear their savior. Anyone who besmirches his sanctity is a heathen, a liar or\u2014even worse\u2014a Democrat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey will tell you that he kept America safe from terrorism because they don\u2019t count the Las Vegas killing, the Texas church massacre, the Unite the Right killing, or any of the long list of mass shootings and hate crimes as \u201cterrorist events,\u201d in the same way that God answers prayers when anything good happens, but it\u2019s Satan\u2019s fault when anything bad occurs.\n\nThat\u2019s how the cult of Trump works. It also explains why trying to apply reason to the presidency of Donald Trump is an exercise in futility. Facts are irrelevant. Logic is meaningless.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis followers will never believe he\u2019s racist. Republican voters will continue to reject the claims of the 18 women who have accused him of sexual misconduct. Fox News won\u2019t even cover any scandal that doesn\u2019t have to do with Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama. Trump is Teflon. He will never be impeached out of office, even if the FBI investigation turns up concrete evidence that shows he colluded with Russia or obstructed justice.\n\nThe fact that he has been deified by white America is not likely to change.

I was able to stomach 20 minutes of Sean Hannity\u2019s performance-enhanced head before I threw up outside my mouth. (His noggin is obviously on steroids. No one\u2019s head can grow to the size of an award-winning watermelon without HGH or the stuff they feed the Tyrannosaurus rex in Jurassic Park.) I soon began to realize a very important fact.\n\nThey all make sense.\n\nTake Hannity\u2019s opening monologue, for instance. Hannity managed to somehow spin the Russian election meddling into a twisted knot of conservative propaganda until it somehow became the fault of Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama:\n\nHe\u2019s actually using facts. Obama did know about the plot to tamper with votes before it was made public, and Clinton did pay for the Christopher Steele dossier. Of course, Hannity leaves out the facts that the dossier was initially funded by Trump\u2019s Republican opponents and that the Obama administration didn\u2019t know about the hacking until late in the election cycle, and enacted sanctions against Russia when it discovered the malfeasance. But, you know ... facts, shmacts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe point is, there are legitimate questions that could be raised about the Obama administration\u2019s handling of the incident, but Hannity and his cohorts use the omission of relevant information to propagate the narrative that Trump is the subject of a Democratic witch hunt at the hands of the FBI, and now I\u2019m screaming at the television because I know there are millions of people watching this who believe it to be the truth.\n\nAnd for the first time, I begin to understand that there are many Trump supporters who are not tobacco-chewing redneck idiots; they are victims of propagandists fueling their confirmation bias. Hannity is as good at what he does as any shady storefront preacher, and I can imagine the people caught in the gravitational pull of his oversized head screaming \u201cHallelujah\u201d at his version of the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\n\nIt is a learning experience, and I promise to share every bit of it.

Up yours!\u201d\n\nBut when Joy Reid came at Tucker with actual facts after Carlson invited anti-immigrant Canadian immigrant Mark Steyn on his show to rant about Hispanics turning Arizona into North Mexico, and asked another guest, \u201cHow many big tech companies were started by people from Central and South America?\u201d Carlson could only resort to the tried-and-true tactic of \u201cI know you are, but what am I?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn her show, AM Joy, Reid invited Jennifer Mendelsohn on to talk about her research into the family history of prominent immigration foes.

Although they were vastly different occurrences, they parallel each other in that the responses to both incidents were both loud and angry.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re exhausted from hearing about the first: when our Dorito-dust-covered doofus president called Haiti and other countries \u201cshitholes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe blowback from both sides was swift and vociferous. Progressives and original-recipe Caucasians immediately branded Trump a racist. Conservatives, white people who want their \u201ccountry back\u201d and Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s cousin\u2019s children on his mama\u2019s side alt-right-splained it away by saying that Trump wasn\u2019t a racist because he shook a black person\u2019s hand one time in 1994. Trump himself even pushed back by proclaiming himself to be \u201cthe least racist person\u201d ever.\n\nThe second situation occurred on the website Babe, when a woman recounted a night with comedian Aziz Ansari that ended with her feeling \u201cviolated.\u201d\n\nThe reaction to the piece has been as divided and cacophonous as the Trump shithole backlash. Some say Ansari is being castigated, when it seems like his only crime was misreading cues. Others say his actions were typical of the aggressive male assumption that he has consent unless a woman screams \u201cNo\u201d or chops him in the throat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow do I feel about the Aziz Ansari incident? My opinion is that I should shut the fuck up.\n\nI am not, nor ever will I be, a woman; therefore, it is not for me to determine whether a woman\u2019s sense that she was violated are legitimate or not. Every single person reading these words knows that there are men who don\u2019t understand consent or completely disregard it. Whatever my feelings are about the incident\u2014I will never be the one riding home crying.\n\nThat is also how I wish white people felt about racism.\n\nWhite people\u2019s misconceptions about racism mirror what a large number of men think about consent. There are white people everywhere who believe they \u201ccan\u2019t be racist\u201d because they haven\u2019t said the word \u201cnigger\u201d or burned a cross on anyone\u2019s lawn, in the same way that some men feel they aren\u2019t guilty of sexual assault, harassment or misconduct because they didn\u2019t hold a woman\u2019s legs open or threaten to fire her if she didn\u2019t perform sexual favors. They believe they get to define their misdeeds and determine how the subject of their actions should respond.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLook, I get why there is so much conflict over the Babe story. It has nuances, and people are predisposed to picking sides. But the voices asking, \u201cWhy did she stay so long and subject herself to being violated?\u201d sound a lot like people who ask why Trayvon Martin didn\u2019t just talk to George Zimmerman, why Freddie Gray ran or\u2014more appropriately\u2014 \u201cIf it\u2019s not a shithole, why did they come here?\u201d\n\nFor instance, Tavis Smiley recently took a break from his rigorous schedule of Obama hating to admit to having consensual sexual relations with his employees, but declared that he wasn\u2019t a sexual harasser. He excused the prospect that a woman might feel powerless to resist the advances of the man who signs her paycheck by asking, \u201cHow else are you going to meet people?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTavis\u2019 explanation of \u201cBut my job is where the hos at\u201d is no different from the explanation offered by conservatives like the sentient stalk of celery Tucker Carlson, whose counterargument is, \u201cBut some countries are shitholes.\u201d Ben Shapiro, editor-in-chief of the damn-near alt-right Daily Wire took a shit on his keyboard and submitted it to the National Review, asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s the Point of Labeling Trump a Racist?\u201d Shapiro writes:\n\nNow, let\u2019s stipulate a few facts. First, Trump makes racist statements, from his attacks on a \u201cMexican\u201d judge to his willingness to wink at the KKK to his quasi-defense of some of the \u201cgood people\u201d in the Charlottesville white-supremacist march. Second, Trump\u2019s worldview is not openly racist \u2014 he\u2019s not a representative of Richard Spencer\u2013type white supremacism, declaring black Americans lesser, for example. With that in mind, let\u2019s now ask a simple question: What\u2019s the point of labeling Trump personally a racist?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTucker, Shapiro and white people in general feel that for something to qualify as racist, it must be accompanied by malicious intent. They\u2019re the type of people who would shoot someone by accident and say, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare start bleeding because I didn\u2019t mean to do it. Plus, it\u2019s only a flesh wound!\u201d For them, if they don\u2019t walk around feeling hate in their hearts for black and brown people, their acts\u2014no matter how offensive\u2014don\u2019t qualify as racist.\n\nThe H&M hoodie debacle is a perfect example of how this works. There are very few people\u2014black or white\u2014who believe that there was an executive-level meeting where the marketing department at H&M decided to fuck with Negroes by dressing up a black child in a \u201cCoolest Monkey in the Jungle\u201d shirt. They probably didn\u2019t think about black people at all. But the company\u2019s lack of intent doesn\u2019t mean the resulting ad wasn\u2019t racist.\n\nH&M doesn\u2019t get to decide how someone will react to its poor choice of clothing. Neither Donald Trump nor Tucker Carlson can regulate people\u2019s responses to the words coming out of Trump\u2019s shithole. Aziz Ansari doesn\u2019t get to determine how a woman will react to him placing her hand on his dick or sticking his fingers in her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd none of this is to equate Aziz Ansari with Donald Trump. Neither man will lose his job, and only one of them will be seen as a pariah (hint: it\u2019s the orange one).\n\nIn a statement, Ansari acknowledged the incident, saying that the woman privately texted him after the incident and told him how she felt. Ansari said that he \u201ctook her words to heart and responded privately after taking the time to process what she had said.\u201d\n\nThere is no way to tell if Ansari truly learned from the incident or changed his behavior. But at least he didn\u2019t explain it away by saying he was the least rapey person in the world, or say that his misconduct never took place. He admitted that it happened and then he shut the fuck up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite people, I hope you were watching.", "keywords": ["racism", "black", "didnt", "ansari", "white", "aziz", "trump", "consent", "say", "shitholes", "america", "understands", "racist", "men", "understand", "woman", "took", "sexual"], "polarity": -0.038930078360458115, "subjectivity": 0.4284036568213784},

And in that spotlight, each of the articles he referenced as examples of this hate was an article I wrote\u2014including (but not limited to) \u201cWhite People Need to Be Better People\u201d and \u201cWe Need a Reset Button or Something for White People.\u201d\n\nI have been trying to keep this information concealed for years now. I\u2019ve secretly hated white people since a skating party in 1992, when a white girl named Megan Lipslinker laughed at me when I fell in the rink while attempting to jump around when House of Pain\u2019s \u201cJump Around\u201d came on. Since then, my hate has done nothing but grow and become hungrier, like a guy at Old Country Buffet who\u2019s hungry as shit but can\u2019t eat because the server hasn\u2019t given him clean silverware yet.\n\nAnd like most other hungry things\u2014and, well, most other things that need to stay alive\u2014it needs to be fed daily, and this is what I do to keep my hate healthy.\n\nAdvertisement", "keywords": ["yetand", "yes", "things", "spotlight", "right", "jump", "white", "tucker", "articles", "hungry", "wroteincluding", "20", "carlson", "need", "alive", "hate"], "polarity": -0.0388668430335097, "subjectivity": 0.4436507936507937},

You look concerned. Is something wrong?\n\nI was just about to ask you the same question, bruh. Are you OK? I just saw a bunch of tweets that didn\u2019t make sense. They were calling you racist, and they mentioned Toyotas, and something about The Tonight Show band and the place where you work. It really didn\u2019t make sense, so I thought I\u2019d come directly to you.\n\nOh, that? Yeah, Tucker Carlson is beefing with The Root for being racist against white people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait, who is Tucker Carlson?\n\nTucker Carlson is a white man.\n\nThat\u2019s all you got\u2014he\u2019s a white man?\n\nI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to minimize Tucker Carlson. Tucker Carlson is not just a white man; he\u2019s the white man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you hear black people say, \u201cThe white man is a motherfucker,\u201d they\u2019re probably talking about Tucker Carlson. If you looked up \u201cwhite man\u201d in some dictionaries, there\u2019s just a picture of Carlson. He\u2019s such an unremarkable white man, the universe named him after a penis-hiding process. Tucker!\n\nEverything about him screams white. He thinks he\u2019s smarter than he really is. He pretends he\u2019s not racist, but everyone knows he is. His face is always adorned with a Lord Petyr Baelish-like smirk that is a mixture of evil, arrogance and bitch-ass-ness. He has a show on Fox News even though he\u2019s not especially interesting, good-looking or talented. He\u2019s perfectly mediocre. There\u2019s only one way to describe him:\n\nTucker Carlson is a white man.\n\nBut what does that have to do with you? Or The Root? Or racism. Or Corollas? I\u2019m still confused.\n\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here for.\n\nOn Wednesday at 11:09 a.m., I received a perfectly mediocre email from the head booker at Tucker Carlson Tonight (notice the perfectly mediocre name of the show). They requested an interview, saying: \u201cWe often see your pieces in The Root, and we\u2019d be interested in discussing many of the themes relating to race in our country that you often analyze.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat seems perfectly mediocre. So you told them \u201cyes\u201d?\n\nWell, as soon as I read the email, my \u201cnigga senses\u201d started tingling.\n\nYour what?\n\nMy nigga senses. You see, there are many black people who possess a superherolike sense of detecting white fuckery from afar. Whenever I smell Caucasian shenanigans, I feel a tingling at the tips of my fingers and toes. Some people, including my doctor, think I should be tested for the gout, but trust me, it\u2019s a superpower. It\u2019s like Spider-Man\u2019s spidey senses. When I first discovered them, I put in an application with the X-Men, but they haven\u2019t called back. I know it\u2019s because Wolverine be hating on me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what did you do when you felt the tingling?\n\nI did what any smart black man should do: I asked a black woman\u2014specifically, my editor-in-chief, Danielle Belton. I knew she would give me a thoughtful, well-reasoned, educated response.\n\nAnd what did she say?\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do it. Issa trap.\u201d\n\nThose were her exact words. So I emailed the Tucker Carlson show with a keenly worded email detailing my hesitation to appear on the show. I think my response illustrated my feelings that I don\u2019t think productive conversations about race can be had in four-minute segments. Furthermore, I know Fox News tries to include black people so it can make it seem like it\u2019s not racist to its racist audience. I\u2019m not saying that everyone who watches Fox News is a racist. I\u2019m just saying that all racists watch Fox News.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI also think I perfectly outlined my recollection that the last time I was asked to appear on Fox News, on Laura Ingraham\u2019s show, I was replaced by Tariq Nasheed after I declined. I believe my email succinctly summed up my apprehensions.\n\nThat\u2019s dope. It must have been a long email. Can you read it to me?\n\nNo problem; I know it by heart. My email to Tucker Carlson Tonight read:\n\n\u201cNah, fam. I\u2019m good.\u201d\n\nWow. So that\u2019s why they\u2019re mad? Because you didn\u2019t come on the show?\n\nNo, it gets better. It turns out, my nigga senses were right. It was a trap. They wanted to lure me on the show to talk about why The Root hates white people so much. Check out these clips:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, they wanted me to explain why it\u2019s OK to be white.\n\nDamn, that\u2019s cold. But I still don\u2019t understand what this has to do with Questlove, Black Thought or Priuses.\n\nWell, Tucker Carlson decided that his viewers should boycott The Root and our sponsors. One of our sponsors is Toyota. So Carlson decided to do what Sean Hannity did when he convinced the dumb whites (my least favorite flavor of vanilla) to smash their Keurig coffee machines. But Fox News viewers are the people who voted for an alleged pedophile who rode a horse to the polls, so they aren\u2019t as internet-savvy as you would think. So this happened:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomewhere I imagine Black Thought is checking his Twitter feed and wondering what the hell is going on.\n\nSo are you upset that you are being painted as a racist?\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: Some people will say that I am a coward for not going on Carlson\u2019s show to face him and defend myself. I have no need to explain myself, my writings or anything on The Root to a bunch of people whose minds won\u2019t be changed in 40-second sound bites by a black guy they invited on so the host could paint him as anti-white anyway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd why would I smear Tucker Carlson\u2019s mediocre whiteness as racist?\n\nI have written a lot of incendiary things about white people. I won\u2019t shy away from that. I have called white people racist and made fun of their dancing skills, their potato salad and how often they shoot up schools. I created the Wypipo Awards and held an entire Wypipo Tournament to find the worst of the worst. But none of the articles Tucker Carlson listed were written by me!\n\nHe literally called a random black guy to explain why the works of another black guy were racist. Which. Is. Racist. But you know ... I guess we all write alike.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut is The Root racist against white people?\n\nDammit, man! You\u2019re going to make me reveal the secret to our sauce. OK, I\u2019ll reveal it, but make sure you don\u2019t tell anyone. Here it is: No one at The Root hates white people. We hate racism. We are often called racists because of an old Southern saying: \u201cA hit dog will holler.\u201d\n\nWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\n\nIt means if you throw a rock into a pack of dogs, only the one who is hit will let out a yelp. The rest just go on about their business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA woman once took umbrage with my portrayal of white people, called me a \u201cblack gangbanger\u201d and asked me how that made me feel. I told her it did not bother me because I am not a gangbanger. I went about my business. Yet some white people are so racist that when we throw rocks at racism, they think we are targeting white people. They are hit dogs. That\u2019s why they holler.\n\nThe white people hollering at Questlove and driving their Rav4s back to the Toyota dealership will never be killed because The Root racially profiled them. The Root has never sent Fox News viewers\u2019 children to underfunded white schools. The Root doesn\u2019t subject Carlson\u2019s fans to longer prison sentences because they are white. The Root has never issued a travel ban against mediocre white boys or tried to deport the Caucasians who come to our country and take our jobs. But, to be fair, the entire staff at The Root wouldn\u2019t mind if someone built a wall around Fox News, but we don\u2019t have the funding.\n\nAnd some of them, we suppose, are good people.\n\nSo how will you settle this?\n\nWe probably won\u2019t. Historically, white people don\u2019t have a long record of taking shit back. Plus, the idea of a hip-hop beef between Fox News and The Root seems like fun. I don\u2019t know if Carlson is P. Diddy or Suge Knight in this scenario, but I bet Carlson won\u2019t be talking that shit when I roll up with The Root staff and the X-Men in my used 4Runner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo you don\u2019t feel bad at all?\n\nI\u2019ll be honest. There was one small part of the clip that made me feel a little bad about this entire Caucasian kerfuffle: when Tucker Carlson looked into the camera and said this:\n\nAttacking people on the basis of their race is wrong. That was the standard, and for a long time almost everybody in America believed it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI won\u2019t lie.

Smiley responded:\n\nI certainly understand that there are persons who believe that there is no such thing as a consensual relationship in the workplace. I hear that. I can respect that point of view. But there are other opinions on this. In my employee handbook we do not encourage interoffice relationships but we don\u2019t forbid it either because I don\u2019t know how things are going to turn out in your life and you start hanging out with our company. I don\u2019t know who you\u2019re going to meet. And let\u2019s face it, nobody\u2019s working 40-hour weeks anymore. We are working 40-, 50-, 70-, 80-hour weeks. Where else are you going to meet people in this business?\ufeff\n\n\n\nTavis Smiley, are you fucking shitting me? For the first time in my life, I agreed with Carlson\u2019s look of permanent incredulity-constipation-horror, and I hope to never return to that place again, but if Smiley keeps running his damn mouth, I may very well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhew. OK. Let me collect my breath here.\n\nFirst of all, Smiley is a news veteran, and he knows how questions work. He didn\u2019t actually respond to Carlson\u2019s question, which was about subordinates\u2014people who work for him. Instead, he offered up a roundabout answer about consensual, intraoffice relationships among co-workers\u2014this isn\u2019t the issue PBS has with him.\n\nAlso, what employee handbook would actively encourage romantic relationships between co-workers? Of course your handbook didn\u2019t say that shit, Tavis! That\u2019s a walking, talking human resources nightmare, and you don\u2019t get kudos because your employee handbook didn\u2019t do something that literally no handbook in the history of all the hands and all the books ever said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich brings me to the next and most important point: Your workplace is not your personal Tinder. Now, some people develop attractions to their co-workers. Some even develop consensual relationships with them. But for the boss (which Smiley was) to treat his payroll like a series of profiles on which he can swipe right at his disposal is improper and a flagrant abuse of power. And Smiley is clearly too arrogant to see that.\n\nWhen a boss hits on his subordinate, whether he\u2019s aware of it or not, he\u2019s the beneficiary of a power dynamic that favors him. Even if the employee shares the boss\u2019s attraction, he or she is burdened with navigating the consequences in a way the boss is not. Reject the relationship, and one\u2019s career progress may be at stake. Accept the relationship, and be forced to reckon with the judgment of co-workers or other supervisors.\n\nThis is what PBS is alleging. According to ABC News, PBS claims that not only did Smiley have multiple sexual relationships with subordinates, but employment decisions may have been linked to sex. The company, which has placed Smiley on an indefinite suspension, is saying that those relationships and interactions were not consensual. On top of that, Smiley also made his employees sign nondisclosure agreements, ensuring that any potential misconduct would be protected by a wall of silence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe currently have no idea how many toxic situations Smiley may have created among his employees\u2014how many talented women there are whose careers he may have derailed, whose work he may have trespassed on, for the sake of his sexual whims.\n\nSmiley\u2019s continued response to the allegations, a mix of defiance and entitlement, suggests he doesn\u2019t much care.", "keywords": ["consensual", "relationships", "smiley", "employee", "defends", "meet", "handbook", "dont", "relationship", "going", "work", "tavis", "pbs", "employees", "sexual"], "polarity": 0.17479674796747968, "subjectivity": 0.47578397212543544},

Some were boundary-expanding, one-time occurrences, like News Fellow Anne Branigin\u2019s night at the opera. Many of them were the result of bullying and peer pressure, like when the staff discovered that News Editor Breanna Edwards had never seen the movie Purple Rain, or when the staff discovered that I had never tasted bacon.\n\nBecause I am willing to walk a mile in anyone\u2019s shoes, or because I\u2019m stupid, this week I will become a Donald Trump-supporting, Fox News-consuming Republican.

This week I will still enjoy my daily fix of sports and other entertainment, but my news consumption will be restricted to conservative media outlets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy transformation began Monday night with an hour of programming on Fox News. I watched the end of Tucker Carlson\u2019s show as the sentient piece of iceberg lettuce guffawed about liberals\u2019 angst over gun control, because dead kids are always hilarious. I was able to stomach 20 minutes of Sean Hannity\u2019s performance-enhanced head before I threw up outside my mouth. (His noggin is obviously on steroids. No one\u2019s head can grow to the size of an award-winning watermelon without HGH or the stuff they feed the Tyrannosaurus rex in Jurassic Park.) I soon began to realize a very important fact.\n\nThey all make sense.\n\nTake Hannity\u2019s opening monologue, for instance. Hannity managed to somehow spin the Russian election meddling into a twisted knot of conservative propaganda until it somehow became the fault of Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama:\n\nHe\u2019s actually using facts. Obama did know about the plot to tamper with votes before it was made public, and Clinton did pay for the Christopher Steele dossier. Of course, Hannity leaves out the facts that the dossier was initially funded by Trump\u2019s Republican opponents and that the Obama administration didn\u2019t know about the hacking until late in the election cycle, and enacted sanctions against Russia when it discovered the malfeasance. But, you know ... facts, shmacts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe point is, there are legitimate questions that could be raised about the Obama administration\u2019s handling of the incident, but Hannity and his cohorts use the omission of relevant information to propagate the narrative that Trump is the subject of a Democratic witch hunt at the hands of the FBI, and now I\u2019m screaming at the television because I know there are millions of people watching this who believe it to be the truth.\n\nAnd for the first time, I begin to understand that there are many Trump supporters who are not tobacco-chewing redneck idiots; they are victims of propagandists fueling their confirmation bias. Hannity is as good at what he does as any shady storefront preacher, and I can imagine the people caught in the gravitational pull of his oversized head screaming \u201cHallelujah\u201d at his version of the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\n\nIt is a learning experience, and I promise to share every bit of it. If, by the end of the week, you hear news about a certain The Root writer wandering in circles at a Trump rally, muttering Republican talking points and wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat, you\u2019ll know I didn\u2019t make it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could use your thoughts and prayers.\n\nAnd liquor.

Because not only the pageant world, but the beauty industry as a whole has been making some major progress toward diversity.\n\nGIF\n\nEarly last fall, mega-brand CoverGirl shed its classic \u201cEasy, breezy, beautiful\u201d slogan for a fiercer campaign: \u201cI am what I make up.\u201d The brand also ushered in six new badass ambassadors\u2014including Issa Rae\u2014who bring their new mission of inclusivity front and center. And no current beauty conversation would be complete without mentioning Rihanna\u2019s September launch of Fenty Beauty. The launch shook the beauty community to its core, not only breaking the internet but also dispelling some long-held myths surrounding black women and makeup.\n\nSo why, in this melanin-winning back-to-back, inclusivity-embracing, post-Fenty era, are major brands still launching half-assed, lame attempts at diversity?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week, Tarte Cosmetics, a popular brand known for its cult favorite Shape Tape concealer, launched the highly anticipated Shape Tape foundation. For weeks, Tarte built up the hype for the release with teaser emails and clickbait posts. So imagine the disappointment when thousands of followers flocked to the site, credit card in hand, ready to purchase, only to discover 13 shades of beige and two shades formulated for \u201cricher skintones.\u201d Swatches pictured online were tweeted and retweeted relentlessly.\n\nThe dragging that ensued on Tarte\u2019s timeline was not only epic but truly entertaining. The company eventually had to disable both its Instagram and Twitter comments in an attempt to silence all the negative publicity. Days after throwing shade at Fenty, rationalizing, doubling down on its stance and ignoring its customer base didn\u2019t work, the brand finally relented by posting a response to the outrage on Popsugar, promising more shades to come in the near future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut by then it was already too late. Beauty influencers like Jackie Aina, Makeupshayla and Alissa Ashley took to their social media accounts and promptly got to roasting. It was so delicious, I almost stopped the videos to go grab marshmallows from the kitchen (every good roast has marshmallows).\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s sad, really. Women of color have long been conditioned by makeup brands to be OK with being an afterthought. These manufacturers put little to no effort into the formulation of our shades, or the inclusion of more-diverse models. Instead, we\u2019ve typically been told:\n\n\n\nWomen of color typically don\u2019t invest in luxury makeup brands, meaning those shades don\u2019t sell.\n\n\n\nDeeper shades are more difficult to formulate.\n\n\n\nRicher colors will come out in future launches. We want to see how the product tests in the market first.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in the past, we\u2019ve accepted these excuses as fact \u2026 until Fenty proved that the rhetoric was wrong:\n\n\n\nWomen of color historically didn\u2019t buy expensive brands because the three shitty shades you offered didn\u2019t match or wear well. As one Twitter user stated, \u201cif you only offer red, red as hell and what the hell, I\u2019m going to opt out.\u201d I can get the same horrible look with drugstore brands. I\u2019ll keep my $40. THANKS.\n\n\n\nIf you can formulate deeper eye shadow, lipstick and bronzer shades, then it stands to reason that foundation shades are not that much different. You employ chemists. Why am I mixing shades in my bathroom to try to get a perfect match? I\u2019m not Walter White.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nWhy should we have to wait for a future launch when the Christian Grey-worthy 50 shades of beige you just released could have been cut in half, and replaced with five to 10 deeper shades with golden, olive and neutral undertones?\n\n\n\nIn the end, it basically all comes down to one thing: SHADE.\n\nUnfortunately, Tarte just so happens to be the company that took the dragging this go-round, but far too many brands continue to operate in this manner. I remember rushing out and purchasing the Laura Mercier Translucent Loose Setting Powder, after hearing dozens of girls rave about how it \u201cdoesn\u2019t add color,\u201d has zero flashback in pictures and sets your makeup to perfection. Lies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe powder is stark white. It not only adds a white cast, but if you\u2019re any darker than Denise Huxtable, it\u2019ll have you looking casket ready, if you\u2019re not careful. That was at least five years ago. The brand JUST came out with ONE chocolate-girl-friendly shade last year.\n\n\n\nWomen of color are no longer being silent about their discontent. The bar has been raised, and your three obligatory WOC-friendly shades\u2014chestnut, mahogany and espresso\u2014are no longer going to cut it. We\u2019re not only vocally speaking out, but we\u2019re also speaking with our dollars. We\u2019re supporting brands that support us, because companies will continue to think it\u2019s OK to underrepresent WOC until we show them otherwise.

This led Lisa Durden, a political commentator who was an adjunct professor at Essex County College in Newark, to appear on Fox News to discuss the controversy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBoo-hoo-hoo,\u201d Durden said sarcastically in the June 6 interview with Tucker Carlson. \u201cYou white people are angry because you couldn\u2019t use your white privilege card to get invited to the Black Lives Matter all-black Memorial Day celebration.\u201d\n\nThe exchange quickly turned heated, with Carlson, a man clearly capable of making and breaking careers, going on to call Durden \u201chostile and separatist and crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re demented actually,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cYou\u2019re sick and what you\u2019re saying is disgusting and if you were a Nazi I would say the same thing to you.\u201d\n\nTwo days after the interview, the school suspended Durden, who taught courses on mass communication and culture, from her teaching duties with pay, although only about a week remained in the summer school session. Two weeks later, Durden was fired from Essex, a campus that is federally designated as a \u201cPredominantly Black and Hispanic Serving Institution.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post after her removal, Durden didn\u2019t mince words. \u201cI was publicly lynched,\u201d she said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t let me finish the class and they disrupted the learning process. I had a right to free speech, and I exercised that right.\u201d\n\nIn a lengthy statement\u2014posted in text and video form on Friday\u2014Essex County College President Anthony Munroe said the school was \u201cimmediately inundated with feedback from students, faculty and prospective students and their families expressing frustration, concern and even fear that the views expressed by a College employee (with influence over students) would negatively impact their experience on the campus.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn consideration of the College\u2019s mission, and the impact that this matter has had on the College\u2019s fulfillment of its mission, we cannot maintain an employment relationship with the adjunct,\u201d Munroe, who is also black, said in the statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeslie Farber, Durden\u2019s attorney, confirmed to NJ.com that her client is considering legal action against her former employer.\n\n\u201cI believe their first suspending and then firing her was directly because of her appearing on the Tucker Carlson TV show, and is a violation of her federal and state constitutional rights to free speech,\u201d Farber said.", "keywords": ["jersey", "youre", "black", "professor", "fires", "privilege", "went", "white", "durden", "students", "fox", "interview", "school", "tucker", "criticize", "carlson", "college"], "polarity": -0.01879181424635971, "subjectivity": 0.4433130001311821},

There\u2019s Sean Hannity, who suspected \u201csecret sperm\u201d in Kehinde Wiley\u2019s depiction of Barack Obama.

Black women showed up and showed out in various ways. Black men put their careers and livelihoods on the line to speak out against racial injustice, police violence, and sexual assault and harassment. Creative artists experienced amazing glow ups, and black teenagers all over the country showed that no matter what, still we rise. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the biggest winners of 2017.\n\nBlack Activism\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a year that began with us getting the worst president in the world, black activists continued to do the work to help black people stay alive and get free. That activism took on many forms\u2014from protests both loud and silent to creative arts projects to writing\u2014and it was prolific in the year 2017.\n\nBlack people fought and continued to fight for clean water for the people of Flint, Mich., as well as other cities; social justice; economic justice; and an end to the state-sanctioned murder of black people at the hands of police. These fights are not over, and if 2017 was any indication, our voices will only get louder in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyonc\u00e9\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 broke the internet in February when she announced that she was pregnant with twins via an Instagram post, and her year went on an upswing that has not ended. Although we know she has plenty of haters, it\u2019s hard to understand how you can hate on someone so graceful, so beautiful, so talented and so free in her own black womanhood. Her pregnancy led to the birth of beautiful twins\u2014 which she has blessed us with time and time again. Oh, and Sir and Rumi were cute, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer charity and generosity are not always made public, but she gives from the heart when it matters most. Not to mention, her after-pregnancy snapback was real and an inspiration to us all. Deep down inside, she is just a \u201cTexas bama\u201d who has her fangirl moments just like the rest of us, and we are here for it. Long live Queen Bey.\n\nFenty Beauty\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all have our own favorite makeup brands, but when Rihanna announced that she would be launching Fenty Beauty in September, black girls (and the rest of y\u2019all) went crazy. No, she didn\u2019t make it just for us, but she made it for us in that she kept black girls in mind when creating the color ranges. The products flew off the shelves faster than they could be stocked.\n\nFenty had other beauty lines shook time and time again because Fenty had the range. Just one month in, Fenty had $72 million in earned media value, showing us that the combination of Black Girl Magic and black-girl social media capital is a guaranteed win. Right on, Fenty. Right on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack High School Seniors Accepted to College\n\nDespite being told by America every single day that their lives don\u2019t matter, black students continued to push forward and show that yes, the hell they do. Even as people tried to call them underachievers and say they are destined to a life of nothingness, black kids stood up and loudly proclaimed, \u201cYes, we can!\u201d Whether they were getting accepted to all eight Ivy League schools, heading off to Harvard or fulfilling their dream of going to their favorite HBCU, black high school seniors did the damn thing in 2017, and we are proud of y\u2019all. Keep pushing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardi B\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe don\u2019t dance no more, she makes money moves. If you look up the phrase \u201cglow up\u201d in the dictionary, right after the definition of the new vertical on The Root, there will be a picture of Cardi B, her tongue hanging out and the look of win on her face, because she seriously glowed up in 2017. Regardless of how you may feel about her, your hate and a Grammy snub won\u2019t stop her shine. She signed big deals, had one of the biggest hits of the year (my current theme song/anthem), got big props from the Queen herself\u2014and despite rumors of a potential breakup, her boo Offset proposed to her with an 8-carat diamond ring. Cardi did 2017 big as hell, and we can only expect that will continue in 2018.\n\nTerry Crews\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt takes a black man who is strong in will and mind to display restraint and not beat the shit out of a perverted white man who gropes his genitals in full view of everyone at a Hollywood party. It takes an even stronger black man to come forward during the #MeToo storm and admit that he, too, was sexually violated by a powerful white man in Hollywood. That strong black man was Terry Crews.\n\nWhile some questioned why he didn\u2019t just pummel Adam Venit when the Hollywood power broker allegedly grabbed his genitals at a party, Crews showed that it\u2019s a game of chess, not checkers, and in the end, the sound mind wins. He filed a police report, filed a lawsuit and spoke out against sexual assault in Hollywood, letting everyone know that he would not be a victim. He was named one of Time magazine\u2019s \u201csilence breakers.\u201d He dropped WME\u2014the agency Venit worked for that basically did nothing to protect Crews and everything to protect Venit\u2014and moved on to new representation, all without being the stereotypical angry black man that everyone wanted or expected him to be.\n\nThat is the very definition of winning. Kudos, Terry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarack Obama\n\nBarack Obama won 2017 the day he left office as the president of the United States. I am very sure it was like when Scarface quit his job in Half Baked.\n\nOur president started wearing less and going out more. He sent his wife a cute Valentine\u2019s Day tweet. He got crowds and applause just for being a regular-ass dude. People wanted so much more of him, the bidding war over his memoirs reached $60 million. He received the 2017 JFK Profile in Courage Award. He even reported for jury duty in Chicago. He basically showed everyone that leaving the presidency hasn\u2019t stopped his shine or his charisma, and your orange-colored Oompa Loompa of a president could never. Come through, Barack. Come through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColin Kaepernick\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNFL ratings are down, and league officials don\u2019t know what to do about it. Good. The NFL deserves whatever \u201cL\u2019s\u201d it gets because the NFL turned its back on Colin Kaepernick. Meanwhile, Kaepernick continues to shine. When he started his silent protests during the national anthem last year, he was widely criticized by people who didn\u2019t understand his need and desire to fight for black lives or the recognition he got for it. None of that matters. Despite it all, Kaepernick is living his best life. He has gotten award after award, and he is even considering buying an NFL team. Take that, NFL. Long live Colin Kaepernick.\n\nBlack Women\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2017 was the year of the black woman. From your Auntie Maxine Waters to Serena Williams winning the Australian Open while pregnant to Karen Bass\u2019 hilarious takedown of Jeff Sessions to black women showing up to guarantee Roy Moore did not win in Alabama to Tarana Burke and the #MeToo movement, black women were here for you. Black women have always been here for you. Black women will continue to be here for you. Now black women need you to be here for us.

In its announcement, Fox said, \u201cAfter a thorough and careful review of the allegations, the company and Bill O\u2019Reilly have agreed that Bill O\u2019Reilly will not be returning to the Fox News Channel.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Reilly released his own statement, though if one were expecting acts of contrition from the conservative media juggernaut, they know little about Bill O\u2019Reilly.\n\n\n\nThe statement reads:\n\n\n\nOver the past 20 years at Fox News, I have been extremely proud to launch and lead one of the most successful news programs in history. ... It is tremendously disheartening that we part ways due to completely unfounded claims. But that is the unfortunate reality many of us in the public eye must live with today. I will always look back on my time at Fox with great pride in the unprecedented success we achieved and with my deepest gratitude to all my dedicated viewers. I wish only the best for Fox News Channel.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nO\u2019Reilly\u2019s attorney, Marc E. Kasowitz, saw that sass and told his client to hold his bag while he upped the antagonistic ante:\n\nBill O\u2019Reilly has been subjected to a brutal campaign of character assassination that is unprecedented in post-McCarthyist America. This law firm has uncovered evidence that the smear campaign is being orchestrated by far-left organizations bent on destroying O\u2019Reilly for political and financial reasons. That evidence will be put forth shortly and it is irrefutable.\n\nThe \u201cirrefutable\u201d evidence Kasowitz speaks of will likely arrive around the same time President Tropicana Jong-il releases his tax returns, Rachel Dolezal gets honored by Khia at the Soul Train Awards, and Jesus swag-surfs back to earth solely to get Suge Knight out of jail.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the women who said they were wrongly harassed by this man in the workplace and who deserved better than the payouts used to silence them in order for Fox to protect its predatory investment, this is a deserving victory. More will be inspired to share their stories of sexual harassment, thanks to these women who decided to speak up. Meanwhile, there\u2019s a delicious irony in discovering that a man who routinely lectured to black people about their moral failures is alleged to be a serial sexual harasser\u2014one who likes coining nicknames like \u201chot chocolate\u201d for his black victims, at that.\n\nTo wit, in 2002, O\u2019Reilly successfully led efforts to get Pepsi to drop an ad featuring Ludacris. Now, 15 years later, O\u2019Reilly is being booted from his No. 1 show while Ludacris is starring in the No. 1 movie in the country. Yes, this is the perfect time to start rapping along to \u201cMove Bitch.\u201d\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, O\u2019Reilly\u2019s firing still feels a bit bittersweet. For one, his now former employer has long known about his accused habits. Fox News had been settling cases for years, so they didn\u2019t ax him because he was a predator so much as because he became a liability. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s ratings were on the rise as the scandal grew; they dropped when he went on vacation, and there is already talk that Fox News\u2019 ratings could drop as much as 25 percent without O\u2019Reilly. If the advertisers hadn\u2019t fled, O\u2019Reilly would still be on the air\u2014to more viewers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nO\u2019Reilly has been the greatest star of the conservative-media complex that orbits largely around Fox News. That industry is built majorly around playing to the prejudices of its audience\u2014notably with respect to racism. O\u2019Reilly has been casually misogynistic for decades, but he often spewed his harshest rhetoric toward black people.\n\n\n\nO\u2019Reilly has been spewing racist rhetoric in defense of the \u201cwhite establishment\u201d for decades. O\u2019Reilly has condemned black women, men and children in the harshest of ways, but none of that had ever been a problem. And sadly, his replacement will be bringing similar issues with him to the same hour.\n\nLike O\u2019Reilly, Tucker Carlson is racist and likes to play to the racist fears of his conservative viewership. Like O\u2019Reilly, Carlson loves to belittle women. One great example of this came during an on-air appearance that Carlson did with Teen Vogue writer Lauren Duca. Or the time he described Hillary Clinton\u2019s face as \u201ccastrating.\u201d Or the time he argued that 15-year-boys dream of being sexually harassed by their female teachers. Or that time he claimed women were too \u201csensible\u201d to get involved in politics. Or, better yet, the time he claimed that sexual harassment happens only in private.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBill O\u2019Reilly can fall dick first into the fieriest pit in hell, but he\u2019s being replaced by the kind of person whose sexist views help create the Bill O\u2019Reillys of the world. And Carlson is as racist as O\u2019Reilly. So, as much amusement as there is in watching the decimation of Bill O\u2019Reilly, it\u2019s already tiring contemplating that the end result is a younger face being given the chance to sell the same old strains of hatred to the little monsters watching at home.\n\nBut, not to be a complete pessimist, I will join Maxine Waters at the Bill O\u2019Reilly-got-fired party, where she most surely is leading the Electric Slide.\n\n", "keywords": ["replaced", "black", "rising", "misogynist", "oreillys", "star", "fox", "sexist", "racist", "oreilly", "bill", "carlson", "women", "harassment", "popular", "sexual"], "polarity": 0.16937290928768198, "subjectivity": 0.5264294733044733},

Artist Kehinde Wiley portrays the former president as concerned, probing, and calm, with just the faintest hint of a smirk playing across his lips; he is settled within a radiant, repeating wall of foliage, faintly obscured where his shoes nestle into the overgrowth. As presidential portraits go, it\u2019s bold, opinionated, and utterly modern. Alongside Amy Sherald\u2019s painting of Michelle Obama, it also happens to be the first commission to a black artist from the National Portrait Gallery.\n\n\n\nAccordingly, Sean Hannity does not like it. In point of fact, he thinks there is \u201csecret sperm\u201d on the painting, and it frightens him. This is not a euphemism; he thinks that Wiley painted jizz onto Obama\u2019s face. In a since-deleted post entitled \u201cPORTRAIT PERVERSION\u201d published today on his blog, an author mysteriously dubbed \u201cHannity Staff\u201d writes:\n\nControversy surrounding Kehinde Wiley\u2019s wildly non-traditional portrait of the Commander-in-Chief broke out within minutes of its unveiling; with industry insiders claiming the artist secretly inserted his trademark technique -concealing images of sperm within his paintings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re hoping for more explanation than that, you will not find it in the article, which is still available to read via cache. It moves on from there to note that the artist once sardonically used the phrase \u201ckill whitey\u201d in a New York magazine profile, which at least has the virtue of being true, unlike the claim that he put sperm in his painting of Barack Obama, which is objectively not true.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look, just to be sure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYep, definitely just a person\u2019s face. You\u2019d think Sean Hannity would be the expert on aggressive sexual deviancy, given that he spent most of his career working for disgraced sexual predator Roger Ailes and alongside disgraced (alleged) sexual predator Bill O\u2019Reilly.\n\nUnfortunately, this is what happens when you take news tips from 4chan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat would explain why Hannity pulled the article, as well as the tweet endorsing said article almost immediately after issuing it.

A month prior to the general election for U.S. Senate in Alabama, I have been attacked by The Washington Post and other liberal media in a desperate attempt to smear my character and defeat my campaign. [1]\n\n1. First of all, the Washington Post isn\u2019t the one walking around every day dressed like they\u2019re auditioning to play Yosemite Sam in a live-action Bugs Bunny movie. Nor were they the ones allegedly trolling junior varsity football games, asking ninth-graders if they needed help with their social studies homework. I\u2019d say that had something to do with \u201csmearing your character\u201d... but, whatever dude.\n\nOver the last 40 years I have held several public offices, including Deputy District Attorney, Circuit Judge, and Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. [2] In addition to running five statewide and three county campaigns for public office, I have been involved in two major controversies that attracted national attention, one about the Ten Commandments and the other the sanctity of marriage. The Alabama Judicial Inquiry Commission, Court of the Judiciary, and Attorney General have investigated, scrutinized, examined, and vetted me, not to mention every opposing candidate against whom I have run. [3]\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. You were elected in Alabama. To get elected in Alabama, all you have to do is say something about Jesus and have an \u201cR\u201d next to your name on the ballot. Alabama Republicans would elect a sock puppet to office if he showed up at the local Walmart and formed a prayer circle after handing out cans of Mountain Dew.\n\n3. Again, \u201cvetting\u201d in Alabama is different. You only have to answer three questions:\n\nAre you a U.S. citizen?\n\n\n\nDo you believe in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ? (The blond one, though. Not that socialist Arab fella.)\n\n\n\nWar Eagle or Roll Tide?\n\n\n\nI have been married for almost 33 years to my wife Kayla. We have four children and five granddaughters. [4] We are in the process of investigating these false allegations to determine their origin and motivation. For instance, we have documented that the most recent accuser, Beverly Nelson, was a party in a divorce action before me in Etowah County Circuit Court in 1999. No motion was made for me to recuse. In her accusations, Nelson did not mention that I was the judge assigned to her divorce case in 1999, a matter that apparently caused her no distress at a time that was 18 years closer to the alleged assault. Yet 18 years later, while talking before the cameras about the supposed assault, she seemingly could not contain her emotions. [5]\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Translation: I\u2019m straight. And I be fucking. Also, let\u2019s not forget Kayla\u2019s yearbook photo is right next to one of the accusers\u2019.\n\n5. Dude, what the hell are you talking about? So your first line of defense against a woman who said you sexually assaulted her is: \u201cWell, why didn\u2019t she say something about that traumatic day in her life when I was a powerful judge, sitting in front of her exercising my authority over the dissolution of her marriage, in what was probably another one of the most traumatic experiences in her life\u201d? That\u2019s the excuse you\u2019re gonna go with? For real? I would have suggested, \u201cI am innocent. I didn\u2019t do this,\u201d but you\u2019re the legal expert here. So ... aight.\n\nMy signature on the order of dismissal in the divorce case was annotated with the letters \u201cD.A.,\u201d representing the initials of my court assistant.

And, unfortunately, relentless, since reason and fact and the supporters\u2019 own, actual, deaths just don\u2019t seem to matter, either.\n\nBut can we take a moment to step back and acknowledge how gotdamn fucking weird it is, too? Deciding, as a response to Keurig\u2019s decision to stop airing ads on Hannity\u2019s Fox News show\u2014a decision the company eventually rescinded, but whatever\u2014to go into your kitchen and smash your coffee maker to smithereens and then post it to the internet is a weird-ass thing to do!\n\nThe only reasons I can think of to destroy an expensive coffee-making apparatus in your own home are:\n\n1. if it was being used, by an ambitious and resourceful killer, to bludgeon you to death, and you needed to break it to save your own life; or, perhaps,\n\n2. if it grew sentient and decided to stop making coffee and just spent the entire day on your couch watching Vice Principal reruns on HBO On Demand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, and only then, would I think, \u201cYou know what?

They even started calling them \u201cfreedom fries\u201d\u2014Freedom. Fries.\u2014which, again, is weird as fuck! What the hell did a french fry ever do to them, besides be delicious and surprisingly good with Dijon mustard?\n\nThere\u2019s also the practice of burning the jerseys of professional athletes who decide to switch teams. We all recognize the unambiguous racial subtext of these white fans performing this act when disappointed by black players, but what about the abject weirdness of going into your closet and grabbing a Kevin Durant jersey and then going to your deck and grabbing some lighter fluid, and then going to your backyard to set it on fire and posting your Durant bonfire on the internet?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you are my friend and I call you up and say, \u201cHey, friend, what\u2019s going on?\u201d and you say, \u201cI\u2019m in my backyard filming the tiny flames emitting from the remnants of that $450 LeBron jersey I bought three years ago.

It\u2019s pretty much both a support group and a perpetual verifier, because some of this shit is so weird that we believe no one would believe us unless other people witnessed and/or experienced it, too.\n\nIt even affects how we consume the news.

I\u2019m not a fan of Fenty foundation. *Ducks.*\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: I\u2019m enthralled by the range of shades, the marketing, beautiful packaging and even the specially trained Fenty specialists who color-matched me in Sephora. But after three tries, I had to accept that this foundation and I just weren\u2019t a match\u2014in tone or texture\u2014though I kept the bottle on GP. (I foundation-hack it; more on that later.)\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean there wasn\u2019t anything else to fall in love with in this launch. Determined to invest my dollars in some black-tastic beauty, I found four instant and now indispensable favorites to add to my cosmetics bag\u2014and they\u2019re not all the usual suspects.\n\nOK, maybe this one is: But after one cappuccino, two cups of tea, half a brisket sandwich and a bag of potato chips, two-and-a half glasses of sparkling ros\u00e9, shrimp cocktail and french fries (my questionable diet being a post for another day), read my lips:\n\n\n\nStunna Lip Paint is the truth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the snub-nosed, felt-tipped applicator (which gives coverage and precision) to the perfect true-blue red of this inaugural shade, this highly pigmented lip color gives new meaning to \u201clongwear.\u201d And while it dries perfectly matte, it took a smooth seven hours before my lips actually felt dry, which was quickly remedied by a swipe of balm. Even then, the color stayed true. In fact, most of the day, I forgot I had it on ... until someone complimented me on my lipstick.\n\nI love the look of bronzed, luminous skin\u2014even if I have to fake it. After my foundation and brows, the next thing I apply is a few swipes of a Match Stix Shimmer Stick. My daily go-to is Rum, which gives me a subtle sheen (and also makes a great eye shadow), but my new fave is Blonde, which really goes for the gold (without the canary yellow of Trophy Wife). I love that these sticks aren\u2019t over-creamy; they go on like a powder and stay all day. Plus, like much of the line, the packaging is magnetic, which makes them easier to keep track of, travel with and store.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBonus shade: Ridiiic. I love to swirl my blush brush over this shade and onto the apples of my cheeks to create a fresh and sexy coral flush that\u2019s just ... ridic.\n\nIronically, the Invisimatte Blotting Powder was a dark horse for me, despite being a seemingly white powder. But this superfine formula is truly colorless and does a fantastic job of blotting down my more emollient foundations (since I actually find Fenty too flat for me). The accompanying puff is fairly basic, but I prefer to use it with my own brush. Which brings me to my absolute favorite item in this entire collection ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLadies, back away from the beauty blenders (though Fenty\u2019s got those, too); y\u2019all are sleeping on Fenty\u2019s foundation brush. This brush is hands-down the best I\u2019ve ever used to apply foundation\u2014and I\u2019ve been using foundation brushes for decades. Unlike blenders, which are great to use damp, but often absorb as much product as they deposit, this domed, densely packed brush gave me a truly flawless finish\u2014no matter what foundation I paired it with.\n\nAnd aside from its utility, it\u2019s beautiful, and being a woman-on-the-go like myself, Rihanna truly thought of everything, including a brush protector that makes it easy to toss in a bag without mess or damage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo there you have it: the Fenty finds I\u2019m holding on to for dear life.

Some were boundary-expanding, one-time occurrences, like News Fellow Anne Branigin\u2019s night at the opera.

I watched the end of Tucker Carlson\u2019s show as the sentient piece of iceberg lettuce guffawed about liberals\u2019 angst over gun control, because dead kids are always hilarious. I was able to stomach 20 minutes of Sean Hannity\u2019s performance-enhanced head before I threw up outside my mouth. (His noggin is obviously on steroids. No one\u2019s head can grow to the size of an award-winning watermelon without HGH or the stuff they feed the Tyrannosaurus rex in Jurassic Park.) I soon began to realize a very important fact.\n\nThey all make sense.\n\nTake Hannity\u2019s opening monologue, for instance. Hannity managed to somehow spin the Russian election meddling into a twisted knot of conservative propaganda until it somehow became the fault of Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama:\n\nHe\u2019s actually using facts. Obama did know about the plot to tamper with votes before it was made public, and Clinton did pay for the Christopher Steele dossier. Of course, Hannity leaves out the facts that the dossier was initially funded by Trump\u2019s Republican opponents and that the Obama administration didn\u2019t know about the hacking until late in the election cycle, and enacted sanctions against Russia when it discovered the malfeasance. But, you know ... facts, shmacts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe point is, there are legitimate questions that could be raised about the Obama administration\u2019s handling of the incident, but Hannity and his cohorts use the omission of relevant information to propagate the narrative that Trump is the subject of a Democratic witch hunt at the hands of the FBI, and now I\u2019m screaming at the television because I know there are millions of people watching this who believe it to be the truth.\n\nAnd for the first time, I begin to understand that there are many Trump supporters who are not tobacco-chewing redneck idiots; they are victims of propagandists fueling their confirmation bias. Hannity is as good at what he does as any shady storefront preacher, and I can imagine the people caught in the gravitational pull of his oversized head screaming \u201cHallelujah\u201d at his version of the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\n\nIt is a learning experience, and I promise to share every bit of it. If, by the end of the week, you hear news about a certain The Root writer wandering in circles at a Trump rally, muttering Republican talking points and wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat, you\u2019ll know I didn\u2019t make it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could use your thoughts and prayers.\n\nAnd liquor.

The group of nonthinking matte eggshells who once labeled Martin Luther King Jr. and Colin Kaepernick \u201ccommunists.\u201d\n\nWhite people.\n\nNow they are mad at coffee machines.\n\nNo, seriously ... they are. In support of an allegedly verified pedophile (because if pedophilia were like Twitter, Roy Moore would have a blue checkmark), Caucasians have mounted a campaign of destroying their own property as a protest. I know it doesn\u2019t make any sense, so I will explain it to you.\n\nLate last week, the Washington Post published a story about Roy Moore\u2019s alleged preference for ninth-graders. The report included four women who have never met one another and yet all tell similar stories about the Alabama Republican running in a special election for a Senate seat.\n\nMoore reportedly likes his women like he likes his coffee: fresh, hot and not yet capable of solving binomial equations. The story was immaculately reported with 30 corroborating sources. But you know how the Washington Post can be sometimes\u2014always bringing up factual old stuff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince the story was first reported, a fifth accuser has emerged with a story that mirrors those of the first four, including a yearbook signed by Moore. What 30-year-old does that? Until this story came out, I had legitimately forgotten that was a thing. One of Moore\u2019s former co-workers even came out to say that Moore was known to troll malls and high school football games for teens.\n\nIn response to the charges, the technological marvel whose head was somehow replaced with a Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade float, Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity, invited Moore to defend himself Friday night. Moore did such a poor job of explaining his alleged preference for women who read Judy Blume novels that Hannity was forced to offer an assist, repeatedly mansplaining Moore\u2019s reported encounter with a 14-year-old by saying, \u201cNo other sexual conduct had taken place. No sexual intercourse.\u201d Hannity later added that the allegations by the 16-year-old \u201cinvolve kissing and only kissing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Hannity allowed an accused child molester to grace his airwaves and equivocate about sexual molestation, people began pressuring advertisers to pull ads from Hannity\u2019s show. Coffee maker-maker (I\u2019ve always wanted to use that in a sentence) Keurig was one of the first companies to remove its advertising from the show, along with Realtor.com, 23andMe and Nature\u2019s Bounty.\n\nYou can\u2019t smash a website or a DNA company. So white people took their frustration out on the closest thing available\u2014their Keurig coffee machines. Soon after Keurig pulled its ads, the hashtag #BoycottKeurig went viral on white Twitter, and people began posting pictures and videos of themselves smashing their coffee machines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs one of the few adult humans who don\u2019t share an affinity for the triple-filtered mud-cake beverage called coffee, I am not shocked by this caucasity. These are the same people who hire dominatrixes to put their testicles in vices and believe that driving their Jeeps through the mud on the weekend is a sport. I\u2019ve seen Jackass. I know how this works.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing about this: It actually worked! Keurig apologized.\n\nIn an internal statement to employees, the company said that it had only planned to \u201cpause\u201d its advertising on the show, but that it was a mistake because it made the company look like it was \u201ctaking sides.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaking sides? Sides? There\u2019s another side to excusing pedophilia? There\u2019s an actual flip side to giving voice to an alleged child molester? (You should know that I say \u201calleged\u201d for legal reasons, but my heart says \u201cbaby rapist.\u201d)\n\nEither white privilege is the most powerful trump card in the world or we\u2019ve been doing it wrong all these years. Instead of marching across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, maybe we should have just smashed voting booths to smithereens. Maybe Rosa Parks should have busted the windows out of that Montgomery, Ala., bus.

The new beauty mogul, who rocked the cosmetics industry this past September with her full-spectrum beauty launch, responded kindly and clearly on why even the question was problematic:\n\n\n\nSad, indeed. In two decades of acting and modeling\u2014plus-sized modeling, to be specific\u2014I\u2019ve definitely experienced my share of tokenism (as has our supermodel editor, Veronica Webb). Sometimes it\u2019s being cast as the cute-but-not-at-all-threatening sidekick/accessory; more often, it\u2019s as the sole black girl in major campaigns. It seems that there\u2019s rarely ever room for more than one, a fact Rihanna references here. It\u2019s reductive and ultimately divisive when you think about how many beautiful, talented and worthy black women there are in the game.\n\nWhat Rihanna touches upon here is the nuance of a politically correct practice that is simultaneously necessary and dehumanizing. Brands need diversity to show that they\u2019re inclusive, but it\u2019s rarely a moral decision; it\u2019s usually an economic one. But with black women holding down 22 percent of the American beauty market, we not only deserve better, we deserve more. We deserve to be viewed as more than quotas. We\u2019re human, like everyone else, and we like to be pretty, too.\n\nObviously, the same is true of trans women\u2014not to mention the multitudes of black trans women. Here at The Glow Up, we respect and hope to represent all iterations of black womanhood, so trans representation is important to us. But what we\u2019re not going to do is strategically tokenize our trans sisters. Diversity of expression in womanhood should be organic\u2014and, above all else, human. When and where we enter should be at our own pace and comfort.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich brings me to another important point that Rihanna touches on here: privacy. In my discussion with Veronica about this issue, she recounted working with all types of trans models during her storied career, most memorably, Teri Toye. The truth is, the fashion industry had a \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy as deep (yet, not as damaging) as the military\u2019s. Fashion has long been a space where all gender and sexuality types\u2014if not body types\u2014could peacefully coexist and thrive at whatever level of exposure they felt comfortable with.

And while you didn\u2019t go full Wakandan cosplay for the premiere, you did wear all black. Even copped a beret from the beret-copping store. And of course, you loved the film. Couldn\u2019t stop raving about it. Even plan to see it again next weekend.\n\n\n\nYour girlfriend, whom you saw it with, loved it, too. And she\u2019s also planning to see it again. Not with you, though\u2014with her girlfriends. They planned an entire evening, actually. The movie and then group massages. Which is great, you guess, that women are also very interested in Black Panther. And understandable, with the strong female characters and feminist themes throughout the film.

During a conversation on the June 28 edition of Premiere Radio Network\u2019s The Sean Hannity Show, the conservative kook lamented about how unfair various users of Tinder, Bumble and other online dating apps are being for sending all of his orange homeboys\u2019 supporters to the left (yes, I hear Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s voice now, too, beloved).\n\nThe exchange, courtesy of Media Matters, went as follows:\n\n\n\nSEAN HANNITY (HOST): Alright so I don\u2019t know if you have the same thing, what do they call this matchmaking thing, timber and all that other stuff that they got? Tinder and all that other stuff? KATIE HOPKINS: Yeah, we have that. HANNITY: OK so there apparently Donald Trump according to the Sacramento Bee is saying people will ask straight up do you vote for or do you support Trump. And if you did boom, that\u2019s it. HOPKINS: You\u2019re off. HANNITY: You\u2019re off. Trump voters please swipe left and go to your room and think about what you have done on Tinder. I mean where is this hatred coming from? Salon had to take a Trump free Tuesday day today because they\u2019re so unhinged over there. What\u2019s going on? HOPKINS: Well I mean first things first, Mr. Hannity, I think you and I and the rest of the population should always be very cautious of anybody that meets their date online. Like if you have to form a relationship online it probably means that in real life you\u2019re a bit of a prat and nobody wants to hang out with you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere is the hatred coming from?\n\nI was always encouraged to avoid asking dumb-ass questions; pity that Hannity was never #Blessed with that nugget of valuable intel. For fellow fools with similar inquiries, seek counsel from a Mexican, a Muslim, one of \u201cthe blacks,\u201d or any woman who both bleeds and has no issue with questioning Bankruptcy Batista. Shoutout to Mika Brzezinski.\n\nMeanwhile, anyone who still questions online dating is a dial-up dummy who needs to get with us broadband baddies. That said, consider the source of such accusations\u2014that folks who date online are social pariahs who can\u2019t function in real life. Folks like Hannity cater to an audience who miss the days of segregated water fountains, so it\u2019s impossible for them to understand how \u201cTimber\u201d works.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe article that riled \u2019em up is titled \u201cHow Donald Trump Is Killing Romance.\u201d In it, writer Angela Hart explores how our current political climate\u2014so nasty, so rude\u2014has impacted those online looking to get some good lovin\u2019, body rockin\u2019, knockin\u2019 boots all night long (yeah).

Blige sang about before Kendu Issacs went and fucked it all up.\n\n\n\nHart reports:\n\n\u201cHis presidency has created this new deal-breaker,\u201d said Laurie Davis Edwards, a relationship coach and founder of the website eflirtexpert.com. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen it like this before, where people say \u2018no\u2019 to Trump supporters, or they only want to date other Trump supporters,\u201d she said. \u201cIt tells me that people are valuing politics much higher as a preference than they were before. ... It\u2019s another example of how massively our dating culture has changed over the past four years, partly because of politics and also because of technology.\u201d Tinder allows people 500 characters to write their profiles. For Bumble, it\u2019s only 300. Since January, many are using that limited space to make it public how much they detest Donald Trump .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my Tinder profile, I mention that I don\u2019t trust anyone who doesn\u2019t like Beyonc\u00e9. I\u2019ve tried to date Beytheists before, but it\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand. When seeking companionship, you have to find those who align with you spiritually and, yes, politically. Evidently, quite a few folks are only now realizing how important it is not to date anyone who supports someone with the political ideology of a Twitter egg, Klansman or suburbanite complicit in demagoguery.\n\nHart goes on to write:\n\nThe site\u2019s data also underscores what dating experts are seeing: 60 percent of singles say they are less open to dating across party lines than two years ago. It\u2019s more stark among liberals. Conservatives are 57 percent more likely to date across party lines. But if you voted for Trump last election, you may have limited your dating pool. Match found that 91 percent of liberals say they judge potential dates negatively for having voted for Trump, and more than half said they\u2019re more likely to ask about their political views since the election. \u201cPeople are so divided in our country right now that they don\u2019t even want to start a relationship with someone who they don\u2019t agree with politically. I\u2019ve never seen it like this, ever,\u201d Spira said. \u201cBeing on the same political page is more important to singles now than it has ever been in history. It used to be that dating a smoker was a top deal-breaker. That\u2019s been replaced with politics.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t know what planet a lot of you folks were living on, but welcome to the rational side of life. For the life of me, I\u2019ll never understand why it took a 71-year-old man-baby, audacious bigot and overall ignoramus to get many to see what\u2019s already been there. But better late than never, folks.\n\nDo not date people with political views that will drive you mad. There is no middle ground between respecting black lives and not giving a damn about state-sanctioned violence against black women, men and children. There is no accord that can be reached between respecting a woman\u2019s autonomy and thinking Planned Parenthood is a baby-killing factory. No way in hell can you find peace with someone who voted for Peachy Pol Pot.\n\nSean Hannity may feel otherwise, but does anyone really want relationship advice from someone who is so far up 45\u2019s ass that he can smell the bullshit at least 45 minutes before it shows up on our morning Twitter feeds?", "keywords": ["sean", "hannity", "supporters", "sex", "cant", "trump", "online", "tinder", "political", "dont", "date", "voted", "relationship", "dating", "accept"], "polarity": 0.02842938311688312, "subjectivity": 0.46251014610389607},

While many outlets mistakenly reported the numbers as earnings, earned media value is actually the estimated value of publicity a brand gains through digital or social media.\n\nBrands pay for advertising every single day. That advertising can cost a lot of money. EMV shows us how much a company gets and what it would have cost had the company actually paid for the advertising. When a brand\u2019s products get talked about, shared, tweeted and written about in magazines, on social media, that is basically free advertising for them.\n\nEMV measures how much that advertising would have cost if the brand had paid for it. It is not an indication of the brand\u2019s actual earnings. However, earned media value can and does turn into real revenue for a company. It is a measurement of social capital.\n\nThink of it the way you think of tweet impressions. Press the Twitter Analytics button on any one of your tweets. The impressions number is how many eyeballs saw your tweet. That plays into EMV.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow think of tweet engagement as sales. Someone seeing your tweet is an impression. That\u2019s eyeballs on a product. Someone engaging with your tweet? That\u2019s a sale. This is how EMV works.\n\nIn other words, if eyeballs on the tweet, post, etc., lead to people clicking and going through to buy a product, that is EMV.\n\nIn the case of Fenty Beauty, when the company launched on Sept. 8, the internet went wild. Women tweeted, took Instagram pictures and made Facebook posts showing their hauls and their face-beats using the highly coveted products. That is advertising gold. Fenty didn\u2019t have to do anything but be great; social media fans did all the rest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only companies to do better than Fenty Beauty during the month of September were Anastasia Beverly Hills and legacy cosmetics brand MAC. Rihanna\u2019s company even beat out brands like Urban Decay and Kylie Cosmetics.\n\nThis is a very specific example of the power that black people, and specifically black women, have on social media. Our voices and our dollars matter and make a huge difference.\n\nThese other companies would do well to pay attention. Black Twitter holds a lot of social capital. Black people have a lot of dollars, and we are willing to spend them on the right products and companies. We will also uplift the products and companies we like.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe success of Fenty Beauty in its first month was largely driven by social media.

I was able to stomach 20 minutes of Sean Hannity\u2019s performance-enhanced head before I threw up outside my mouth. (His noggin is obviously on steroids. No one\u2019s head can grow to the size of an award-winning watermelon without HGH or the stuff they feed the Tyrannosaurus rex in Jurassic Park.) I soon began to realize a very important fact.\n\nThey all make sense.\n\nTake Hannity\u2019s opening monologue, for instance. Hannity managed to somehow spin the Russian election meddling into a twisted knot of conservative propaganda until it somehow became the fault of Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama:\n\nHe\u2019s actually using facts. Obama did know about the plot to tamper with votes before it was made public, and Clinton did pay for the Christopher Steele dossier. Of course, Hannity leaves out the facts that the dossier was initially funded by Trump\u2019s Republican opponents and that the Obama administration didn\u2019t know about the hacking until late in the election cycle, and enacted sanctions against Russia when it discovered the malfeasance. But, you know ... facts, shmacts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe point is, there are legitimate questions that could be raised about the Obama administration\u2019s handling of the incident, but Hannity and his cohorts use the omission of relevant information to propagate the narrative that Trump is the subject of a Democratic witch hunt at the hands of the FBI, and now I\u2019m screaming at the television because I know there are millions of people watching this who believe it to be the truth.\n\nAnd for the first time, I begin to understand that there are many Trump supporters who are not tobacco-chewing redneck idiots; they are victims of propagandists fueling their confirmation bias. Hannity is as good at what he does as any shady storefront preacher, and I can imagine the people caught in the gravitational pull of his oversized head screaming \u201cHallelujah\u201d at his version of the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\n\nIt is a learning experience, and I promise to share every bit of it. If, by the end of the week, you hear news about a certain The Root writer wandering in circles at a Trump rally, muttering Republican talking points and wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat, you\u2019ll know I didn\u2019t make it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could use your thoughts and prayers.\n\nAnd liquor.

It\u2019s as if Congress went to the local Cracker Barrel and asked for one of those busy sheets they give kids while the parents are talking to keep the president of FlyFishing, Fla., busy\u2014and thus the Fake News Awards were born.\n\nThe worst part of this whole sham is that the president of TabackySpitCup, Texas, has routinely told lies and mistruths since taking office. According to the Washington Post, Trump lied over 2,000 times during his first year in the White House. But in the spirit of bipartisanship, we\u2019re reporting Trump\u2019s list of winners because honestly, being opposed by the president of NASCAR, Neb., is a badge of honor.\n\nFirst off, like much of this administration, the shit didn\u2019t work. I don\u2019t know if the fake-news-media thing was supposed to be lighthearted or what, but late Wednesday night, after several outlets posted that the president was full of crap for announcing that the awards would be coming and then not producing, a seemingly rushed list was ushered onto the GOP\u2019s website, which immediately crashed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s as if the website didn\u2019t even want any parts of this dumbass idea. Once the site was functioning, the winners included all the big names that Trump has openly opposed: the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, blah, blah, blah.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe issue with the New York Times piece cited is that it was a column claiming that the economy would suffer under a Trump presidency\u2014which isn\u2019t fake news because we still don\u2019t know what will happen, and Trump keeps claiming victory for the economic legacy that former President Barack Obama left behind. Assuming that Trump\u2019s plan for utter destruction did somehow boost the economy, the column still wouldn\u2019t be fake news; it would merely be an incorrect prediction, since it was written in 2016, before the president was even in office.\n\nThe Fake News Awards were always going to be a sham. In early January, the president claimed that there would be some kind of event and maybe even trophies!\n\n\n\n\u201cI certainly don\u2019t want to spoil anything,\u201d Sarah Huckabee Sanders, aka Suckabee, said during a press briefing on Jan. 3, the Washington Post reports. \u201cBut my guess is that there are quite a few individuals that could be up for those awards. ... We\u2019ll certainly keep you posted. It might be hard for him to present trophies if you guys aren\u2019t there. But I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll have to wait and see what happens.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump continually teased the idea of specific categories in the Fake News Awards\u2014a task that should have proved easy, considering that he tweeted about \u201cfake news\u201d some 150 times, according to the Post. But the Fake News Awards, much like this administration so far, proved to be a whole lot of talk and very little action.

We\u2019re talking about the powerful women of the Dora Milaje and the scene-stealing M\u2019Baku (Winston Duke), and we even got a new handshake to share with our folk.\n\nGIF\n\nBut as excitement reached its peak after our first look, or looks, at the blockbuster, so have cries of #TeamTChalla\u2014better known as Black Panther\u2014vs. #TeamKillmonger (Michael B. Jordan). But as hell-bent as Killmonger seems to be on black liberation, support for anti-hero/villain Killmonger (Wakandan name: N\u2019Jadaka) may be misplaced, because it clearly comes with a side of toxic masculinity.\n\nDuring my first\u2014and second\u2014viewing of the film, I was undeniably moved by Killmonger. He spoke with the pained voice of black America, a voice that\u2019s been disconnected from its African roots and stifled and silenced by centuries of oppression. One of his first lines in the film is to ask the white female curator of an African art exhibit: \u201cHow do you think your ancestors got these? You think they paid a fair price for it? Or did they take them, like they took everything else?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my theater, a cheer rose from the audience of mostly black folk. When he later pointed out that Wakanda has just been chilling on the sidelines while billions of black folk around the world were suffering, I heard more than a few folks say, \u201cYasss\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d He definitely had a point: Black liberation has always been a debate between tactical resistance and revolution by any means necessary. So it\u2019s not surprising that as more and more think pieces emerge, many are split between #TeamKillmonger and #TeamTChalla.\n\nBut after viewing the movie a second time, I noticed Killmonger\u2019s hella problematic approach to liberation (shoutout to Oakland, Calif.). In a movie that otherwise unabashedly celebrates black women, his actions express a deep misogynoir that begins with the killing of his nameless girlfriend and extends through his scoffing at his aunt, the regal Ramonda (Angela Bassett); choking a female elder/shaman; murdering one of the Dora Milaje; injuring Nakia; and nearly killing Shuri.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKillmonger repeatedly expresses his desire to demolish white European supremacy in favor of a black empire. His analysis of the European oppressors who stole, raped and pillaged their way across the world is not inaccurate. Black people all over the world (except the fictional Wakanda) have had their asses kicked by colonialism. But even with expansive technology and wealth at his fingertips, the only way Killmonger can think to correct this is by mimicking the behavior of the colonizer. He is not merely desiring justice but is lusting for revenge. He\u2019s not on a mission for liberation; he wants annihilation. His brutality is the very embodiment of toxic masculinity.\n\nIn a movie where no character uttered the n-word and black womanhood was centered, Killmonger\u2019s violence toward women\u2014black women in particular\u2014was stark and pronounced. Is this what we think of black American men? With a black American man helming the movie, it would be troubling to think that Killmonger could be read as unilaterally representative of black American male consciousness.\n\nErik Stevens, later Killmonger, is a black male character raised in America\u2014in Oakland, to be precise, the birthplace of the actual Black Panthers. He is a fictional black child whose mother we never see on-screen, who then grows into a black man who has seen violence both personal (the murder of his father) and political (the Rodney King verdict and the Los Angeles riots).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStevens has presumably watched and taken notes on the political realities of America; two years after his father\u2019s death, President Bill Clinton would sign the 1994 crime bill that exponentially increased the black prison population. He escapes that fate by attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, joining the CIA and becoming a political mercenary. He is a product of his upbringing, and his rage is justified.\n\nBut Black Panther presents another path to global black freedom for its audience to consider. Instead of #TeamTChalla or #TeamKillmonger, why aren\u2019t we #TeamNakia?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom almost her first appearance in Black Panther, the character of Nakia told T\u2019Challa about himself and Wakanda, that their country couldn\u2019t idly sit back and watch the world annihilate blackness. She, embracing an arguably more Afrofuturist mindset, wanted restorative justice and liberation for black people across the world\u2014not with guns but with the blessing of Wakandan aid\u2014through their expansive technology and wealth. While it\u2019s true that sometimes revolution requires that we be armed, Nakia\u2019s point of view argued that we cannot rely solely on military might to accomplish our collective goals.\n\nComparing Nakia\u2019s and Erik\u2019s visions for liberation invites us to examine our values when it comes to revolution. And while I don\u2019t agree with everything in TaLynn Kel\u2019s article \u201cAn American Monster in Wakanda,\u201d she does have a point about the complicity of everyone but the character of Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o):\n\n\n\n\ufeffNakia knew it wasn\u2019t enough, which was why she could not stay. Would not stay and in the end, should not stay. Wakanda was complicit in the genocide of millions while looking at those suffering not with compassion, but with dismissal. Wakanda Forever really meant Wakanda first and only. Ignoring genocide doesn\u2019t exempt you from responsibility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese two visions of how we get free also ask us to take a look at our views about gender and masculinity\u2014and how our own silence often equals violence. As 45 percent of ticket buyers during Black Panther\u2019s opening weekend were women, there is also a call for us to bear witness to the ways in which we\u2014especially as black women\u2014are complicit in toxic masculinity in our social movements.\n\nIn a poignant moment after they both believe that T\u2019Challa has been murdered, his general, Okoye (Danai Gurira), and Nakia confront each other. Okoye pledges to serve the throne unconditionally, while Nakia wants to save the country (and black people), but not in service to Killmonger. It\u2019s reminiscent of the ways in which some black women will unconditionally support and protect black men who are obviously dangerous to our communities (R. Kelly, Bill Cosby, etc.) in favor of protecting the idea of blackness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut liberation cannot come on the backs of black women. We have to resist glorifying the character in the story that represents a problematic bag of liberation goals. It is not enough to claim a desire to free black folk, all while murdering, assaulting and disposing of black women. It is not enough to fight for justice while undergirding it with vengeance. Liberation must be for all.\n\nI need to be clear: I love Black Panther for so many reasons, including the way that it\u2019s pushing us to have some much-needed conversations. So much of the film resonated with me, even Killmonger\u2019s poignant last words: \u201cBury me in the ocean with my ancestors that jumped from the ships. Because they knew death was better than bondage.\u201d Those words burned me to my soul.\n\nAs a character, Killmonger reminded me of the oft-quoted James Baldwin: \u201cTo be black and conscious in America is to be in a constant state of rage.\u201d But I also know that when rage is directed solely into vengeance and not justice\u2014at the expense of black women and in the form of blind violence against them\u2014then who are we, if not mirroring our oppressors?", "keywords": ["world", "black", "hero", "liberation", "wakanda", "nakia", "worship", "trouble", "killmonger", "think", "violence", "teamkillmonger", "women", "character", "teamtoxicmasculinity"], "polarity": 0.01912185610532719, "subjectivity": 0.40012611355586547},

Chris Murphy\u2019s calls to finally rein in America\u2019s gun problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe then asked the most useless rhetorical question one could ask, and yet is the thrust of every conservative talking point about gun control: \u201cIs this a problem with the gun or the shooter?\u201d (Hint: You can actually address both, and should, but whatever. Let\u2019s move on.)\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take a look at the gun, the AR-15, what makes it so popular and, overwhelmingly, what makes it so safe\u2014what it takes to get one,\u201d she continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham then introduces her guest, a \u201csecurity and counterterror expert\u201d by the name of Aaron Cohen, but not before launching into a quick brag break about her proficiency and experience with guns, telling viewers that she\u2019s shot gun since she was 6 years old. This, of course, qualifies her to discuss gun control policy much in the same way that someone whose sole qualification of eating McDonald\u2019s cheeseburgers since they were 6 years old qualifies them to steer conversations around obesity and food and health policy.\n\nAgain, moving on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like all weapons,\u201d Ingraham continued. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous in the hands of the wrong person. And if you\u2019re not trained, and if you have a criminal disposition, a violent disposition, it can be turned into a killing machine. But Chris Murphy wants to make this tonight all about the weapons.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, a person with a violent disposition can certainly turn a meat cleaver, a shank or a pot of hot grits into a killing machine. That person would also amass a far lower body count. In 2016, a man in China broke into a school and stabbed 10 children before turning the knife on himself. He was the only casualty\u2014all the children survived.\n\nMeanwhile, the AR-15, as HuffPost notes, was developed for battle and \u201cspecifically designed to kill people as efficiently as possible.\u201d By USA Today\u2019s count, the AR-15 has also been the weapon of choice for eight deadly mass shootings in the last three years. It was used in Sandy Hook in Newtown, Conn.; at the Pulse Night Club in Orlando, Fla.; in San Bernardino, Calif.; and in Las Vegas.\n\nA gun expert told USA Today that the \u201cbad rap\u201d the rifle receives is likely due to \u201ccopycat\u201d killers buying the gun after seeing it featured prominently in these shootings. But it should also be noted that it\u2019s not terribly difficult to get these weapons: According to a 2016 article from The Tab, a 20-year-old man with an expired license was able to purchase an AR-15 in 20 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Florida, for example, while buyers are supposed to pass a background check, there is no waiting period to purchase the AR-15; nor must a user register the gun. As more details about the gunman, Nikolas Cruz, emerge, it\u2019s clear that his school identified him as a threat: At one point, he wasn\u2019t allowed to bring a backpack to campus, one math teacher said, and he was eventually expelled. He also appears to have been a domestic abuser, but was never hit with any charges.\n\nA violent disposition\u2014but one that would pass the background checks that Florida requires.\n\nOutside of the Fox News universe, students and faculty from Douglas High literally begged lawmakers and President Donald Trump to take action:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham, like much of her ilk, wasn\u2019t concerned with listening to these students and educators who just witnessed their classmates, their students and their colleagues mowed down in another gruesome act of violence. While Ingraham was praising the AR-15, a smudged gray cross sat prominently on her forehead\u2014indicating the observance of Ash Wednesday, a day of penitence. A day to express remorse and sorrow. Shame.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for observers to reflect on their mortality, and their sinfulness before God.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dishonest discourse around gun control dished out by conservatives and sponsored by the National Rifle Association is a sin.

To celebrate her Fenty Beauty launch (which was available at midnight Pacific Time on the site, insensitive to East Coast bedtime), the star and her divine beauty debuted the line at Sephora Times Square at the start of New York Fashion Week.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a matter of the Rihanntrepreneur wanting to make money in the makeup business and stack her empire. There\u2019s higher value here. Once you parse through the breathless anticipation and habitual wonderment over her facial chemistry, what women appreciate most is that the Fenty collection is instinctually inclusive and accommodating of a range of skin tones, and that its existence italicizes how much women of color should be in position to create beauty products. There\u2019s primer, foundation, lip gloss (the Universal Lip Luminizer), highlighter, concealer and brushes galore, all well-designed and with inventive, millennial-luring names like Killawatt and Pro Filt\u2019r.\n\nA year ago, I wrote a Jezebel piece about the frustrating cycle for women of color in search of beauty products; I cited a growing number of black stars with beauty ambitions. Kelly Rowland teased a makeup collection called Face for women with darker complexions, and Angela Bassett has a line.\n\nBut Rihanna\u2019s launch has been far and away markedly well-executed, on top of being the most obviously coveted, given her cool factor and her capacity to offer\u2014as a counter to the contour-focused Kardashian kingdom\u2014a line focused on range and accessibility. There\u2019s an inherent trust that Rihanna has our back, which is what branding executives love to hear, along with the consumer\u2019s impossible belief that they could maybe look as flawless as her.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe foundation comes in a spectrum of 40 shades that attempt to solve a persistent dilemma by paying heavy attention to darker skin tones. Here\u2019s Rihanna talking about the importance of simple variety, via Refinery 29's beauty director. \u201cI wanted things that I love. Then I also wanted things that girls of all skin tones could fall in love with,\u201d Rihanna said at the launch. \u201cThat was really important for me. In every product I was like: \u2018There needs to be something for a dark-skinned girl; there needs to be something for a really pale girl; there needs to be something in-between.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have not tried any of the Fenty Beauty products yet, but among other items I am purchasing the gloss and the Killawatt highlighter on the site for testing. The Cut\u2019s review of the highlighter says:\n\n\n\nSo many of the makeup artists I talked to tonight were most impressed with the highlighter. It\u2019s velvety and soft in texture, but not dusty, and the colors are unique. The shade to buy is one called Trophy Wife, a 24-karat yellow-gold shade that really pops on the skin. You can press it on as a highlighter, or dust it more loosely over your eyes for a pretty, glitter-dusted look. (This is what you see on Selena Forrest in the campaign video.) They also come in duos, with day and night options.\n\nMakeup is still a matter of glaring at swatches, mixing and matching, and no one line solves every person\u2019s problem, but you can tell from the reactions\u2014including my Group Chat activity, which likely resembles many others\u2014that this representation is rare and meaningful.

Some were boundary-expanding, one-time occurrences, like News Fellow Anne Branigin\u2019s night at the opera.

This week I will still enjoy my daily fix of sports and other entertainment, but my news consumption will be restricted to conservative media outlets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy transformation began Monday night with an hour of programming on Fox News. I watched the end of Tucker Carlson\u2019s show as the sentient piece of iceberg lettuce guffawed about liberals\u2019 angst over gun control, because dead kids are always hilarious. I was able to stomach 20 minutes of Sean Hannity\u2019s performance-enhanced head before I threw up outside my mouth. (His noggin is obviously on steroids. No one\u2019s head can grow to the size of an award-winning watermelon without HGH or the stuff they feed the Tyrannosaurus rex in Jurassic Park.) I soon began to realize a very important fact.\n\nThey all make sense.\n\nTake Hannity\u2019s opening monologue, for instance. Hannity managed to somehow spin the Russian election meddling into a twisted knot of conservative propaganda until it somehow became the fault of Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama:\n\nHe\u2019s actually using facts. Obama did know about the plot to tamper with votes before it was made public, and Clinton did pay for the Christopher Steele dossier. Of course, Hannity leaves out the facts that the dossier was initially funded by Trump\u2019s Republican opponents and that the Obama administration didn\u2019t know about the hacking until late in the election cycle, and enacted sanctions against Russia when it discovered the malfeasance. But, you know ... facts, shmacts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe point is, there are legitimate questions that could be raised about the Obama administration\u2019s handling of the incident, but Hannity and his cohorts use the omission of relevant information to propagate the narrative that Trump is the subject of a Democratic witch hunt at the hands of the FBI, and now I\u2019m screaming at the television because I know there are millions of people watching this who believe it to be the truth.\n\nAnd for the first time, I begin to understand that there are many Trump supporters who are not tobacco-chewing redneck idiots; they are victims of propagandists fueling their confirmation bias. Hannity is as good at what he does as any shady storefront preacher, and I can imagine the people caught in the gravitational pull of his oversized head screaming \u201cHallelujah\u201d at his version of the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\n\nIt is a learning experience, and I promise to share every bit of it. If, by the end of the week, you hear news about a certain The Root writer wandering in circles at a Trump rally, muttering Republican talking points and wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat, you\u2019ll know I didn\u2019t make it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could use your thoughts and prayers.\n\nAnd liquor.

You know that\u2019s the only reason Fox News is on the air, right? Yeah! It\u2019s not a news channel.

Diddy and trying to turn The Root into Death Row, the sentient packet of Hellmann\u2019s Mayonnaise took to the air to defend Donald Trump\u2019s shithole comments by telling ProsperoLatino CEO Jos\u00e9 Parra\u2014who was President Barack Obama\u2019s Latino communications adviser for the 2012 re-election campaign\u2014that \u201cTrump said something almost every person in America agrees with.\u201d Notwithstanding the fact that \u201calmost every person in \u201cAmerica\u201d (pronounced \u201ccock-agents\u201d) once agreed with slavery, segregation and Jim Crow, I had to admit that Carlson\u2019s comments moved him ahead of Laura Ingraham and Jean Pirro on the race-war-starter leaderboard.\n\nA few days later, when Chicago Alderman George Cardenas called him out on his racism, Carlson melted down into a puddle of urine and skin bronzer, screaming: \u201cYou know what? Up yours!\u201d\n\nBut when Joy Reid came at Tucker with actual facts after Carlson invited anti-immigrant Canadian immigrant Mark Steyn on his show to rant about Hispanics turning Arizona into North Mexico, and asked another guest, \u201cHow many big tech companies were started by people from Central and South America?\u201d Carlson could only resort to the tried-and-true tactic of \u201cI know you are, but what am I?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn her show, AM Joy, Reid invited Jennifer Mendelsohn on to talk about her research into the family history of prominent immigration foes. Mendelsohn revealed that Carlson\u2019s great-great-grandfather emigrated from Switzerland to America because of the Swiss economy and bleak moneymaking prospects, and Reid accused Carlson of having a \u201cblatantly white nationalist view of what immigration should look like.\u201d\n\nTucker wasn\u2019t having that shit. He dug into his bag of facts and emerged with a rebuttal that amounted to \u201cI\u2019m rubber, you are glue ... \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKicking off his argument with the lie that he is at war with \u201cproponents of open borders,\u201d the expert squinter went on to explain how \u201cReid\u2019s entire public career has been built on race-baiting.\u201d (Calling opponents of Trump\u2019s ethnic cleansing plan \u201cproponents of open borders\u201d is like calling pro-choice advocates \u201cbaby-murderers\u201d \u2026 oh, wait.

There is absolutely no reason for Reid to call Tucker a \u201cwhite nationalist,\u201d except for the fact that Carlson repeatedly invites white nationalists on to demonize immigrants of color, espouses white nationalist views (because he never talks about white immigrants like his great-great-granddaddy or the aforementioned Canadian immigrant) and bellows the white nationalist talking point about America\u2019s \u201cidentity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo aside from the fact that Tucker fits the definition of white nationalism, Reid must be \u201crace-baiting.\u201d Now that I think about it, I\u2019m putting all of my bitcoins on Tucker Carlson to wave the green flag at the race war.

The question is, while someone may have clicked on a Russian-bought ad or followed or shared content from a Russian troll account, did those impressions equal votes at the ballot box? And, more directly, how many of them made a difference?\n\nWe may not know the answers for some time.\n\nWhat is clear is that none of the racial strife the Kremlin was trying to exploit was born in Russia. America was a white supremacist nation long before Kremlin insiders long thought about weaponizing social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the missing caveats in news coverage on Russian meddling is self-reflection about what this all means for Americans. If we are to believe that the Kremlin\u2019s use of social media is important enough to hold congressional hearings to grill social media executives, then what are the implications for the consumers?\n\nAre Americans truly at risk of being influenced by social media campaigns by foreign states aiming to turn them against one another? If that is the case, then cleansing platforms of Russian trolls may simply be a bandage on a problem that requires open heart surgery.\n\nThe reality is that it doesn\u2019t take much for white Americans to get riled up against anyone they feel is a threat to their whiteness; nor does it require a foreign entity to do so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo matter how diligently social media companies work to repeal Russian trolls, none of that will address why 53 percent of white women chose their race over their gender when voting for a man with a well-documented history of alleged sexual harassment.\n\nNo matter how many Russian-linked social media impressions Americans clicked on, it will not tackle the uncomfortable truths behind why white lower-income and working-class Americans elected a man who vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act (which Trump strategically called \u201cObamacare\u201d), even though most of them actually need it.\n\nAnd no in-depth results on how Russian-backed ads influenced Americans will solve the most important question of all: Why did so Americans fall for it?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe answer will not be found at the steps of the Kremlin.\n\nThe reality is that it doesn\u2019t take much for white Americans to get riled up against anyone they feel is a threat to their whiteness; nor does it require a foreign entity to do so.\n\nOne of the oldest attempts at misinformation aimed at white people sparked the 1906 Atlanta race riot. Black people began populating the city at the turn of the century, causing white residents to fear their presence and begin plotting ways to undermine them, often with violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs NPR reports, the two men running for governor of Georgia at the time plotted on ways to keep black men away from the polls. The white newspapers ran editorials warning white women not to sit near black bus drivers for fear that black men on the street would \u201cget ideas.\u201d\n\nThe publications ran stories falsely accusing black men of assaulting white women. They weren\u2019t true, but 12 black people and two whites were killed in the race riot in the city, though many historians say the number killed equaled dozens more.\n\nWe don\u2019t have to trudge the annals of history to realize how easily white people can be manipulated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStudies less than a few years old regularly find that white people see black girls as older than they actually are and as less innocent than white ones. White people tend to see black men as more threatening than white men of the same size. A 2017 study finds (pdf) that white people severely underestimate racial economic inequality, assuming that black people are doing better than they actually are.\n\nIt certainly is not a stretch to argue that anyone with the right racist messaging, not just the Kremlin, could manipulate white people who hold such views.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is a prime example.\n\nRussia did not elect Trump. White people driven by racial anxiety did that. There are studies and news reports exploring the racial fissures involved in why Trump was so persuasive with so many white voters, but few are willing to indict them for supporting a racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it is important to explore the ways in which Russia manipulates social media to sway the American public\u2014the New York Times\u2019 investigation into millions of Kremlin dollars bankrolling investments in Facebook and Twitter is a great start\u2014the real come-to-Jesus investigation should focus on Americans who can be so easily swayed by fake news designed to tap their racial fears.\n\nWhen those House and Senate hearings take place on the Hill, perhaps we\u2019ll realize that Russia may have meddled in the 2016 election, but white supremacy hacked America long before Russian President Vladimir Putin had a chance to order his intelligence agencies to finance social media ads that have no power to cast a ballot in the United States.", "keywords": ["social", "feet", "black", "place", "meddling", "cant", "white", "media", "kremlin", "women", "truths", "america", "racial", "men", "americans", "kremlins", "russian", "reveals"], "polarity": 0.049123973139721194, "subjectivity": 0.2820906783505209},

I\u2019ve been visiting Kiev every three months since 2008, but I\u2019ve never been to Chernobyl, just two hours north of the capital city. My Ukrainian friends think I\u2019m nuts for going.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a very brave man,\u201d I\u2019d hear repeatedly.\n\n\u201cVery brave man,\u201d of course, is a euphemism for \u201ccrazy.\u201d My friend Julia told me she was 9 months old and living in Kiev when the Chernobyl outbreak took place. Her father feared that the fallout would reach the capital (as did the Soviet authorities), so he moved the family to the Luhansk Oblast, in eastern Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThat is my memory of Chernobyl,\u201d Julia had told me over drinks a week earlier. \u201cI have not been there and do not want to go there.\u201d\n\nMaking up our group are three men from Lebanon, another dude from Slovakia and our driver. Our tour guide is Elena, a nice Ukrainian woman who has the driest humor in the fuckin\u2019 world.\n\n\u201cOK, guys. We will be gone all day and will not return until 7 p.m.,\u201d she said. \u201cSo keep this in mind as you prepare your business meetings, travel itineraries and Tinder dates. OK? Cool. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019re also reminded that we cannot drink alcohol during the trip; nor can we be intoxicated at any point, as is stated on the contract we signed to participate in the trip (more on this later). About safety, we\u2019re told that as long as we follow the rules, we should not leave the exclusion zone with any more radiation exposure than we\u2019d get from taking an international flight. (Yeah, apparently, flying exposes you to radiation.)\n\nFor foreigners like me, Chernobyl is an adventure. For Ukrainians and those inside Russia and Belarus, which were also affected by the incident, Chernobyl is a memorial. On April 26, 1986, a sudden power surge caused an explosion at reactor No. 4 after workers tried to conduct a test. A huge fireball erupted into the atmosphere. Radioactive rain fell from the sky onto the area as fires from the incident continued for days.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo people died instantly after the explosion, and 28 people died as a result of acute radiation sickness in the following weeks and months. Thyroid-cancer rates skyrocked following the accident. Deaths as a result of exposure are impossible to quantify, but the figures tally from the tens of thousands to millions, depending on whose data you use.\n\nIn the middle of all this, the 40,000 residents of Pripyat, located 30 minutes north of Chernobyl, weren\u2019t evacuated until some 36 hours after the explosion. The Soviets waited weeks to tell the nation\u2019s citizens of the accident, drawing harsh criticism.\n\nThe explosion wasn\u2019t the only issue. A pool of water underneath the reactor had filled with radioactive material that could cause a mass steam explosion that would hit the rest of Europe, causing even more damage. The only way to release it was to dive into the water and drain it. Three brave men volunteered. Millions of gallons of water were released, saving millions of lives. One of the divers died of a heart attack years later, another is still in the industry and information on the third man is unknown. None died in connection with their dangerous dive, as had been initially reported (The video below tells their story.)\n\nThe exclusion zone consists of an area the size of Rhode Island. Hundreds of thousands of people lived there. Now there are roughly 1,000, who refuse to leave, against the wishes of the government. It is estimated that it will take more than 20,000 years before the area in the exclusion zone is habitable again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe radiation levels released that day in 1986 are still considered the highest released ever.\n\nAround 10 a.m., we arrive at the first checkpoint. Our passports are already checked, so we breeze through without a problem. The first thing you hear is silence. Lots of it. The snow crunches underneath our feet as we walk, and our voices are the only sounds we hear throughout the day.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs we step out of the van, several dogs run toward us. I fear being bitten, but Elena calms my anxiety. \u201cThey\u2019re friendly,\u201d she tells us.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re warned not to touch or drop anything on the ground, as everything in the zone is pretty much contaminated. (Of course, some of us dropped our phones. Pray for me.) Neither food nor other agricultural products can grow in the exclusion zone because of soil contamination.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s the middle of winter, so the trees are leafless, but they will fully bloom come spring. However, the soil in many parts is so contaminated that the lower halves of some trees are charcoal black. Train tracks and a warning from Elena are the only things that keep us from venturing off to investigate them further. No fences partition some of the highly radioactive areas off from visitors. Just a stern warning from our guide and an occasional warning sign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the first buildings we enter is a school. The floorboards either rotted through or were stripped away, exposing the ground beneath it. Old toys scattered on the floors remind you of the innocent children who once played with them.\n\n\n\nWhere are they?\n\n\n\nDo they have cancer?\n\nWhat are they doing?\n\nHave they returned to this very spot I paid $125 to tour?\n\nOr have they chosen to move on, intent on never returning?\n\nPeople aren\u2019t supposed to enter the buildings, since they have not been maintained since 1986. We do tour some smaller homes. In one, we see sheet music strewn across the floor. A small black shoe lies on top of debris. On a windowsill, perhaps one that the young owner of the shoe once looked through, sits a book, a small black shoe and a dingy, stuffed toy lion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLess than an hour into the trip, the morbidity of what I am experiencing sets in. I wanted to visit Chernobyl because I sought adventure. I feel bad about it the more I stare at the little shoes of children who were whisked out of their homes, never to return again. I\u2019m standing in a memorial, and as the day moved forward, I try to respect it as such.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElena, our guide, keeps our spirits up with interesting stories along the way. She even warns us of danger approaching. \u201cThere are wolves over there, so be careful,\u201d she says casually, pointing to a wooded area. \u201cI\u2019m just joking,\u201d she would say soon after her warning.\n\nWe don\u2019t get a chance to speak with folks who still live here, but Elena tells us some interesting facts. Like curfew is 8 p.m. If you do not have permission to be here, you risk detention if law enforcement catches you. There have been reports of people sneaking into the exclusion zone over the years. Given that none of them know where the hot spots for radiation are, it\u2019s pretty dangerous. Last year, tourists sneaked into Pripyat and started an old Ferris wheel. To this day, officials marvel at how the intruders managed the feat.\n\n\n\nBy midday, we reach reactor No. 4, ground zero for the Chernobyl disaster. It\u2019s enclosed in a huge shelter to prevent radiation leaks. At 531 feet in length and 354 feet in height, it is considered the \u201clargest land-based movable object ever constructed,\u201d according to The Guardian. The reactor isn\u2019t in operation, but there are workers at the plant conducting experiments, along with cleanup projects, etc. There are plans to turn the site into a renewable-energy farm.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese workers do not work there on a consistent basis. They live outside the zone, many of them in Slavutych, to avoid dangerous contamination levels. Workers in the zone often work two weeks in the zone and take a two-week break outside it.\n\nOur next stop after reactor No. 4 is the Duga radar (known in the west as the Russian Woodpecker), a Soviet ballistic missile defense warning system. It was designed to warn the Soviets of incoming ballistic missiles that would likely be tipped with nuclear warheads designed to wipe the Soviet Union off the map.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m an \u201980s baby, too young to have any real memories of the Cold War. But standing underneath the Duga reminds me of how much humans invested and continue to invest in killing one another. The Duga is no longer operational and now stands as a relic of the Cold War era.\n\n\n\nIt is around 4 p.m., and there\u2019s still a lot to see, but we\u2019re cold. Like, really cold. The sky is dimming, and only interesting stories seem to keep our interests as we brave the chilling air. As we walk past a wooded area, Elena tells us not to go near it because the radiation in the soil is very high. Again, there are no fences or anything to keep folks from wandering into it. I begin to wonder how many intruders make it inside the exclusion zone and play in the forests. It\u2019s impossible to know for sure.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElena tells us about a Russian guy named Ivan who participated in the tour in 2011. He was loaded the morning of the trip and even required assistance by the police at one checkpoint in the exclusion zone because he was so drunk. We\u2019re all told to keep up with our guide at all times, lest we get lost and left in the zone after curfew. Ivan, as Elena tells us, got lost in the town of Pripyat. A few hours later, local cops saw smoke rising from one of the buildings. It was October and Ivan had started a fire to keep warm. The cops took him to a dormitory in Chernobyl, where some workers live.\n\nThat was a big mistake. Ivan started a small revolution, convincing them that the curfew was bullshit. They searched the streets for vodka and had to be collected by the police again. Ivan was taken back to Kiev the following morning and forced to pay a big fine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBesides the Ivans of the world, there are looters who come to the exclusion zone looking for things to steal: wiring, linoleum panels, steel, anything of value. It\u2019s appalling. Why would anyone desecrate this place?\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s getting darker. I\u2019ve seen what I wanted to see. I\u2019m cold and want to leave. And so does the rest of our group. But I\u2019m also equally sad. For every shoe on the ground, there was once a foot in it, worn by someone whose life was altered by a mistake beyond their control. I looked at photos and statues memorializing people who died trying to contain the fallout of reactor No. 4. I wonder where their surviving families are.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs we make our way through the various checkpoints leaving Chernobyl, we walk through radiation scanners. We\u2019re all safe. At the final checkpoint, we are able to buy souvenirs. Again, a dog runs toward our van, but this one was more cautious than the ones that greeted us at the beginning of our journey. Each step I take toward the dog, it takes several back. Then it would sit and stare at me. We repeat this dance several times until I realize that the dog has no interest in being touched.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe finish buying our souvenirs, pack into the van and drive off. It is not lost on me that I left Chernobyl of my own accord. That wasn\u2019t the case in 1986 for the folks who lived here. There are 1,000 residents who still call this place home. They were forced to leave but eventually returned. They\u2019re mostly elderly people. Many of them survived World War II. A nuclear-fallout disaster wasn\u2019t going to push them out of their homes.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you leave you die. ... Those who left are worse off now,\u201d an old woman who lives in the exclusion zone told a documentarian in the 2015 film Babushkas of Chernobyl. \u201cThey are all dying of sadness. ... Motherland is motherland. I will never leave.\u201d\n\n\n\nI cannot pretend to understand their resolve. But after seeing so many memories during my day in Chernobyl, I could see how someone could not bear to leave them behind as I so easily did that Saturday evening.", "keywords": ["chernobyl", "reactor", "workers", "exclusion", "places", "earth", "radioactive", "elena", "im", "radiation", "zone", "toured", "tells", "leave"], "polarity": 0.07492870485678707, "subjectivity": 0.49535996955859957},

The Brooklyn College professor\u2019s most recent paper explored the challenges white teachers face while trying to connect with students in large urban school districts. It also contained all the right buzzwords to be swept up in the right-wing media\u2019s ever-escalating culture war.\n\nAfter the self-styled watchdog Campus Reform blogged about Rubel\u2019s paper on Jan. 8, it was subsequently picked up on conservative, alt-right, and neo-Nazi outfits, including The American Spectator, InfoWars, Breitbart, Stormfront, Frontpage, and Fox News, among others. Rubel\u2019s photograph was plastered across TV\u2019s largest cable news channel without a request for her to comment. She and her colleagues were bombarded with sexist and anti-Semitic hate mail and phone calls. The top of her Google results are now largely populated by this faux story.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSplinter spoke with Rubel this week about the research that set it all off\u2014and what it\u2019s like to be at the center of an alt-right media firestorm. Her remarks have been edited for clarity and length.\n\nUsually when we publish papers, almost nobody has access to them. They\u2019re behind a paywall for everyone besides university students or faculty, and no one is going to pay $50 to read something. But this particular journal happened to be an open-access online journal, so everyone could click on it or do simple keyword searches through Google Scholar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this article, which I published in late December, I profile three teachers who are really excellent at what I and other people call dominant practices\u2014helping people access mathematics, like in after-school programs and summer camps. But they have a lot more trouble with critical practices, which are harder to do and especially hard for white people to do. Those are connecting mathematics to the everyday lives of your students, particularly when your students come from communities that you know nothing about and might even be afraid of.\n\n\n\nFox News ran two stories. One clip brought on a student who doesn\u2019t know me and has never met me, as if he has some kind of perspective. But they didn\u2019t even ask me to speak for myself. It was unbelievable\u2014there\u2019s just no news here. They want me to be fired.\n\nI made the argument that the fact these people I profiled are white teachers makes it more challenging, because changing their behavior or the way the system works would be going against the status quo of how white teachers tend to treat black and brown kids: not trying hard enough, not doing their homework, not having enough grit. The status quo sort of blames them for not doing well on math assessments. I\u2019m speaking as someone who\u2019s white, so I\u2019m part of that, too. I\u2019m pointing my finger at all of us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the first Thursday of January, Campus Reform contacted me by email, asking if I would be available to comment on an article they were doing about my work. And I thought, Do I want to talk to them? I don\u2019t think that anything I can say is going to make it better.\n\n\n\nI had the weekend to wait for it. I had never looked at the site before but started nervously checking it every day. The paper had all types of things that could make certain people enraged. It seems they were definitely looking for \u201cwhiteness.\u201d It was right at the beginning of my paper\u2014it doesn\u2019t seem like they read the rest of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was watching Campus Reform\u2019s ticker of how many times the article was shared and it was just exploding. I\u2019m there thinking, Oh my god. Why are people posting this? They also linked to my faculty web page and right there is my phone number and email address. Immediately, emails and phone calls started coming in.\n\n\n\nThey were things like, \u201cYou are a retarded POS idiot\u2014you are a libtard US jew...more despicable than knee-grows. Keep making excuses for moronic thugs you asshole cunt.\u201d I got more than a hundred like that. Some asked me to go out on a date and also said they wanted to kill me in the same message. Some of the emails were CC\u2019d to the college president and CUNY chancellor, saying that I should be fired. And people were even sending emails with their corporate signature still attached.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt kept snowballing. The Daily Mail picked it up. Then Breitbart picked it up. And from there, it went to Fox News. No one ever reached out to me other than the original student at Campus Reform. I kept finding these things only because I kept Googling, wondering when it was going to stop.\n\n\n\nFox News ran two stories. One clip brought on a student who doesn\u2019t know me and has never met me, as if he has some kind of perspective. But they didn\u2019t even ask me to speak for myself. It was unbelievable\u2014there\u2019s just no news here. They want me to be fired.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey had their usual headline and photograph, as if there was some act or evil or violence. They were really trying to make fun of me. What that seemed to be signaling is showing everyone that I was a woman.\n\n\n\nA lot of the original comments at Campus Reform were all written with male pronouns. I guess because it\u2019s math they assumed I\u2019m a man, which I found amusing. After Fox started showing my photograph, it turned into, This is a Jew. They went after me for being gay.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHad I been in New York I think I would have called the NYPD or campus security to figure out some sort of plan. But the universe took care of me somehow; this happened when I was not in New York\u2014I\u2019m on leave with a Fulbright\u2014and I feel perfectly safe.\n\n\n\nThe professional organizations, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and the Association of Mathematics Teacher Educators, stepped out really quickly and wrote statements in support of my work. My colleagues wrote letters. My school gave me the indication that they heard me and were paying attention. Our union at the City University of New York wrote a very strong statement. But I didn\u2019t get any response from CUNY. I can only imagine that they\u2019re trying to take care of the institution as best they can and that\u2019s why they didn\u2019t speak out. But the attack is as much on them as it is on me.*\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve been waiting for this for 10 years. Whenever I click that button to send that final document, I always ask myself, \u2018Is this something I can live with? If this is something that\u2019s going to get me attacked, is it worth it?\u2019\n\nCampus Reform contacted me again last Thursday. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s their usual MO\u2014to keep sending messages to keep you on heightened alert. They had questions about the nature of the funding of the project. But there\u2019s been no new piece. Maybe there is no piece.\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s irrelevant that I was talking about math. In the worldview of some people, math is so neutral and objective, and in their worldview, me talking about race and equity in the context of math sounds insane.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack in the \u201880s and early \u201890s, there were the Math Wars, which were really contentious political arguments. That was before the internet. Now the right is building out this path. It\u2019s taken them a long time for them to find us\u2014the people who work on social justice in math education\u2014but they\u2019re finding us.\n\nI\u2019ve been waiting for this for 10 years. Whenever I click that button to send that final document, I always ask myself, Is this something I can live with? If this is something that\u2019s going to get me attacked, is it worth it?\n\nI don\u2019t want us to forget about what the real issue is: What\u2019s going on in our schools, particularly New York City schools. I want people to be more enraged about that. That should be the thing that makes us unable to sleep at night. I\u2019m OK.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUpdate, 1:54 p.m.: CUNY Spokesperson Frank Sobrino declared the public university system\u2019s support for Rubel in a statement to Splinter.\n\n\u201cCUNY stands firmly behind Brooklyn College professor Laurie Rubel, whose work has been recognized by the National Science Foundation and the Fulbright Scholars program, among others,\u201d Sobrino said. \u201cThe university is committed to academic freedom and the free exchange of ideas and expression of all points of view.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["going", "campus", "teachers", "mathematics", "university", "math", "reform", "white", "media", "feels", "im", "center", "firestorm", "work", "rightwing"], "polarity": 0.07822699953767916, "subjectivity": 0.4401744210482074},

Originally based on supermodels Naomi Campbell and Tyra Banks, the Dora were initially conceived not only as female warriors but also as potential wives for the king, whom they\u2019ve pledged to protect, along with the royal family. They were the best and strongest women from the 18 villages within Wakanda and trained at the royal palace.\n\nBut while Priest may in part cite supermodels as his inspiration, there is a historical prototype for the Dora Milaje in the Dahomey \u201cAmazons\u201d\u2014so nicknamed by European colonizers and now known by the French-speaking Beninese as the \u201cN\u2019Nonmiton\u201d (which translates to \u201cour mothers\u201d in Fon).\n\nCreated in the late 17th century by King Wegbaja of the West African nation of Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) as a group of female hunters known as gbeto, and later expanded by his son King Agaja, the N\u2019Nonmiton were an all-female guard and fighting force. Like the Dora Milaje, the N\u2019Nonmiton were also considered wives of the king, pledging celibacy as well as loyalty and protection to him. And they existed in this role until the colonization of Dahomey in the late 19th century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can learn all about the incredible female warriors of Dahomey in a 2015 episode of the podcast Stuff You Missed in History Class, and in a very comprehensive comic on their history created by UNESCO for its Series on Women in African History (pdf).

Here we go.\n\nI don\u2019t know how or why I went my whole adult life without ever getting waxed down below, but here we are. To be fair, I was never \u201cTeen Wolf\u201d down there or anything, and I mostly handled it in the shower with a razor\u2014but you can only do so much with a razor, as we all know. There are parts of a lady\u2019s special place that you wouldn\u2019t want to put a razor near or risk getting cut. For those places, there is waxing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nI will admit that I was hesitant for a long while because all I could think about was how painful it must be. I asked all my friends who I know either wax or sugar their lady bits about the process, and most of them told me that yes, it does, in fact, hurt, but it\u2019s well worth it in the end. It took a while for me to be convinced.\n\n\n\nThe turning point for me came in September when a picture of a young lady\u2019s freshly waxed and perfectly greased-up love box floated down the Twitter timeline. I couldn\u2019t stop staring. It was fucking beautiful. I wanted that beauty for myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI made a decision. Fuck it, I thought. I\u2019m doing this.\n\nI asked my women friends in Los Angeles if they knew of a good spot I could go to that was clean and reputable. My girl Genoa referred me to a place in downtown L.A. called Wax Candy. She said she had been there before and had good experiences. I trusted her judgment, so I looked up their website.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir service menu included tips for what to do before and after getting waxed, as well as a diagram showing which parts each type of wax covered. I decided to go with the Brazilian, because if you gonna do it, do it right. Right?\n\nI called on a Friday afternoon and made an appointment for the next morning. That entire night, I stressed myself out thinking about it. Was it going to hurt? How long would it hurt? Was I going to like the outcome? Were my man friends going to like the outcome? Why did I say I was going to do this?\n\nI asked again on the Twitter timeline for tips. People gave me all kinds of helpful advice. Exfoliate before going. Take Advil or Aleve 30 minutes to an hour before the service. Wear loose clothing so as not to irritate it afterward. Moisturize beforehand so it\u2019s easier for the hair to come out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nWhen Saturday morning came around, I got out of bed and began the process of talking myself out of going. I called my best friend for moral support. I wanted her to tell me it was OK to chicken out. She was having none of that.\n\n\n\n\u201cBitch,\u201d she said matter-of-factly. \u201cYou can\u2019t walk around with your pussy looking like your mama\u2019s. Go get the damn wax.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat did it. I got in the shower and took extra care cleaning, because the last thing I wanted was for someone to be nose-deep in my love spot and be like, \u201cDamn, bitch. Did you at least rinse it off?\u201d\n\nBefore putting on my clothes, I slathered as much body butter as I thought I could get away with on the outer surfaces. I wanted to leave no room for error. Right before leaving the house, I popped two Aleve and prayed for the best.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDowntown L.A. is a nightmare when it comes to parking, so instead of driving, I took an Uber. The driver pulled up in front of Wax Candy, and I took a deep breath before getting out of the car. He probably thought that I was going through something, and he was right; I was. I still wasn\u2019t convinced I was going to be OK, but it was too late to back out. We here now.\n\n\n\nI walked inside and a friendly receptionist greeted me. I signed in on the guest list, and because it was my first time, I may have signed some other paper, but I don\u2019t remember now because everything at that point was a blur.\n\nThe receptionist introduced me to my waxer, Allie. Allie was a cheerful, friendly brown girl on the right side of plus-size, and I was immediately set at ease.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe led me to the waxing room and instructed me to take off my pants and underwear. I decided at the last moment to do my underarms as well, so she told me to go ahead and get completely naked. She offered me a paper gown in case I was too modest to let her see me naked.\n\nI did as instructed and lay on the table waiting for her to return. When she did, she told me she was going to start with my underarms.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIs it going to hurt?\u201d I asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt depends,\u201d she answered honestly. \u201cIt can. I\u2019ll do one strip and see how you feel.\u201d\n\nShe did one strip under my left arm and it was so quick, I felt nothing. I was amazed. She quickly waxed under both underarms, and I felt like a champion because nothing made me wince or cry. I hoped the waxing of my pudenda would go just as smoothly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Brazilian wax involves removing all the hair from the front, sides and labia as well as your inner \u201ctushy.\u201d\n\nShe started at the top, just under my FUPA. I ain\u2019t gonna lie, those first few strips hurt, but it was a quick hurt. The pain lasted only as long as it took her to remove the strip from my skin. She pressed down on each place she waxed, and that seemed to reduce the pain and the length of time it lingered by a great deal.\n\nFrom my FUPA, she moved to the top of my vulva, then the sides, and finally inside the labia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe entire time, she kept me distracted with good conversation and laughter.\n\nI know, it\u2019s hard to imagine engaging in laughter while someone is waxing your lady bits, but we really were having a good conversation and laughing all the way through it as she serviced me.\n\nThe service involves putting your legs in the butterfly position and at times lifting one leg or the other to provide the waxer access. I got through all the positions just fine, and again, most of it was relatively painless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nWe finally reached the part of the service where she had to wax the inside of my butt crack.\n\n\n\n\u201cOK,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I need you to do is lift your legs and pull your knees as close to your chest as possible.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMe, knowing all my years of being a ho were finally about to pay off:\n\nGIF\n\nI pulled my legs all the way back and let my feet touch the wall behind my head.\n\n\n\nShe was like, \u201cOK, girl. I didn\u2019t mean all of that.\u201d\n\nI relaxed, and she finished that part of the wax. We were done.\n\nShe got a mirror and handed it to me so I could inspect. As I did, she went over me with a pair of tweezers to make sure she hadn\u2019t missed anything, not much unlike what your eyebrow waxer does. Because she was so thorough, there wasn\u2019t a lot for her to grab with tweezers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I tell you I fell in love with my pussy all over again ... bitch, I feel in love with my pussy all over again. She was so pretty. And smooth! Touching the top of my mound felt like heaven.\n\nI spent the next week finding reasons to touch it when I was alone. I started doing it so much, I had to consciously remind myself not to reach down there in public. I\u2019m not exaggerating. It was so damn soft. Amazingly smooth to the touch.\n\n\n\nI vowed that I would get waxed forever and ever after that. And here comes the downside to it: In order to get waxed, the hair has to have grown to about the size of a fake eyelash. If you can lift it up with your fingers, there\u2019s enough hair to be waxed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor me, it took about six weeks to grow back to that point. It took another two before I was able to secure another appointment with Allie.\n\nI saw her again on Saturday. This time I felt like a pro, and I was ready. She didn\u2019t have to ease me into it. And because I had already been waxed before, the second process went even quicker than the first. We were done in about 10 minutes.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen she was done, I made a request that I thought she might balk at, but she took it all in stride.\n\n\n\nI asked her to oil my girl up and take pictures of her using my phone.\n\nY\u2019all, Allie turned into a damn photographer shooting a model. She caught my girl from so many angles, and all the pictures looked beautiful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have been using them to thirst-trap my male friends ever since.\n\nI cannot recommend getting waxed highly enough.\n\nI got my first-ever Brazilian, y\u2019all, and it literally changed my life.", "keywords": ["brazilian", "going", "waxed", "girl", "service", "getting", "hurt", "thought", "wax", "wanted", "1stever", "took", "life", "changed"], "polarity": 0.20488144078144077, "subjectivity": 0.48138717948717963},

James\u2019 career is interesting in that he\u2019s considered a legend in two games, like Pee Wee Kirkland (his drug use was legendary back then), but the most significant part of his career happened between 1978 and 1985. As opposed to other larger-than-life artists whose hits spanned several decades, James made a really big splash over a relatively short amount of time.\n\nWith Motown and music legend Robinson in tow, James wrote an ode to black women that was slower tempo and more traditional R&B than most of his hits.\n\nWhile James was known for the punk-funk stylings of his larger hits, \u201cEbony Eyes\u201d saw him smooth it out and keep it mellow, mellow. Robinson and James traded stanzas, and most of the hook duties went to James, creating one of the absolutely most perfect karaoke songs of all time, since James\u2019 singing is more performance than it is good. And that\u2019s really what karaoke is all about. I love Rick James; that was not a shot.\n\nWhen James and Robinson really ramp up the energy toward the end of the song, this is when my soul fully embraces all that the song has to offer. From roughly 3:30 until the end of the song, every single time James sings \u201cEbony eyyyyyyyyyyyyyyes of miii-iiiiiiiiiine .... ,\u201d I feel the spirit of Mary Jane.\n\nWhile it is nowhere near Rick James\u2019 most famous or most successful song, I\u2019d stack it against \u201cYou and I,\u201d \u201cSuper Freak,\u201d \u201cGive It to Me Baby\u201d or \u201cCold Blooded\u201d as his second-best song of all time, since \u201cMary Jane\u201d is hands down his best song.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut with \u201cEbony Eyes,\u201d we have an ode to black women being sung by the smooth crooner and the super freak, who shot a nonsensical eight-minute mini movie (the year after Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cThriller,\u201d no less) about their plane, Ebony Eyes, crashing on a beach because of bad weather, and the two of them singing about their ebony-eyed angels back home.\n\nThey build spears, have tiki torches; there\u2019s a parrot; they shave; James throws an SOS note into the ocean; and then a trunk full of white suits\u2014literally, white suits\u2014shows up, they shoot flares, and their women show up on a yacht and rescue them.\n\nIt\u2019s bad, real bad, Joe Jackson.

They were calling you racist, and they mentioned Toyotas, and something about The Tonight Show band and the place where you work. It really didn\u2019t make sense, so I thought I\u2019d come directly to you.\n\nOh, that? Yeah, Tucker Carlson is beefing with The Root for being racist against white people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait, who is Tucker Carlson?\n\nTucker Carlson is a white man.\n\nThat\u2019s all you got\u2014he\u2019s a white man?\n\nI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to minimize Tucker Carlson. Tucker Carlson is not just a white man; he\u2019s the white man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you hear black people say, \u201cThe white man is a motherfucker,\u201d they\u2019re probably talking about Tucker Carlson. If you looked up \u201cwhite man\u201d in some dictionaries, there\u2019s just a picture of Carlson. He\u2019s such an unremarkable white man, the universe named him after a penis-hiding process. Tucker!\n\nEverything about him screams white. He thinks he\u2019s smarter than he really is. He pretends he\u2019s not racist, but everyone knows he is. His face is always adorned with a Lord Petyr Baelish-like smirk that is a mixture of evil, arrogance and bitch-ass-ness. He has a show on Fox News even though he\u2019s not especially interesting, good-looking or talented. He\u2019s perfectly mediocre. There\u2019s only one way to describe him:\n\nTucker Carlson is a white man.\n\nBut what does that have to do with you? Or The Root? Or racism. Or Corollas? I\u2019m still confused.\n\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here for.\n\nOn Wednesday at 11:09 a.m., I received a perfectly mediocre email from the head booker at Tucker Carlson Tonight (notice the perfectly mediocre name of the show). They requested an interview, saying: \u201cWe often see your pieces in The Root, and we\u2019d be interested in discussing many of the themes relating to race in our country that you often analyze.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat seems perfectly mediocre. So you told them \u201cyes\u201d?\n\nWell, as soon as I read the email, my \u201cnigga senses\u201d started tingling.\n\nYour what?\n\nMy nigga senses. You see, there are many black people who possess a superherolike sense of detecting white fuckery from afar. Whenever I smell Caucasian shenanigans, I feel a tingling at the tips of my fingers and toes. Some people, including my doctor, think I should be tested for the gout, but trust me, it\u2019s a superpower. It\u2019s like Spider-Man\u2019s spidey senses. When I first discovered them, I put in an application with the X-Men, but they haven\u2019t called back. I know it\u2019s because Wolverine be hating on me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what did you do when you felt the tingling?\n\nI did what any smart black man should do: I asked a black woman\u2014specifically, my editor-in-chief, Danielle Belton. I knew she would give me a thoughtful, well-reasoned, educated response.\n\nAnd what did she say?\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do it. Issa trap.\u201d\n\nThose were her exact words. So I emailed the Tucker Carlson show with a keenly worded email detailing my hesitation to appear on the show. I think my response illustrated my feelings that I don\u2019t think productive conversations about race can be had in four-minute segments. Furthermore, I know Fox News tries to include black people so it can make it seem like it\u2019s not racist to its racist audience. I\u2019m not saying that everyone who watches Fox News is a racist. I\u2019m just saying that all racists watch Fox News.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI also think I perfectly outlined my recollection that the last time I was asked to appear on Fox News, on Laura Ingraham\u2019s show, I was replaced by Tariq Nasheed after I declined. I believe my email succinctly summed up my apprehensions.\n\nThat\u2019s dope. It must have been a long email. Can you read it to me?\n\nNo problem; I know it by heart. My email to Tucker Carlson Tonight read:\n\n\u201cNah, fam. I\u2019m good.\u201d\n\nWow. So that\u2019s why they\u2019re mad? Because you didn\u2019t come on the show?\n\nNo, it gets better. It turns out, my nigga senses were right. It was a trap. They wanted to lure me on the show to talk about why The Root hates white people so much. Check out these clips:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, they wanted me to explain why it\u2019s OK to be white.\n\nDamn, that\u2019s cold. But I still don\u2019t understand what this has to do with Questlove, Black Thought or Priuses.\n\nWell, Tucker Carlson decided that his viewers should boycott The Root and our sponsors. One of our sponsors is Toyota. So Carlson decided to do what Sean Hannity did when he convinced the dumb whites (my least favorite flavor of vanilla) to smash their Keurig coffee machines. But Fox News viewers are the people who voted for an alleged pedophile who rode a horse to the polls, so they aren\u2019t as internet-savvy as you would think. So this happened:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomewhere I imagine Black Thought is checking his Twitter feed and wondering what the hell is going on.\n\nSo are you upset that you are being painted as a racist?\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: Some people will say that I am a coward for not going on Carlson\u2019s show to face him and defend myself. I have no need to explain myself, my writings or anything on The Root to a bunch of people whose minds won\u2019t be changed in 40-second sound bites by a black guy they invited on so the host could paint him as anti-white anyway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd why would I smear Tucker Carlson\u2019s mediocre whiteness as racist?\n\nI have written a lot of incendiary things about white people. I won\u2019t shy away from that. I have called white people racist and made fun of their dancing skills, their potato salad and how often they shoot up schools. I created the Wypipo Awards and held an entire Wypipo Tournament to find the worst of the worst. But none of the articles Tucker Carlson listed were written by me!\n\nHe literally called a random black guy to explain why the works of another black guy were racist. Which. Is. Racist. But you know ... I guess we all write alike.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut is The Root racist against white people?\n\nDammit, man! You\u2019re going to make me reveal the secret to our sauce. OK, I\u2019ll reveal it, but make sure you don\u2019t tell anyone. Here it is: No one at The Root hates white people. We hate racism. We are often called racists because of an old Southern saying: \u201cA hit dog will holler.\u201d\n\nWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\n\nIt means if you throw a rock into a pack of dogs, only the one who is hit will let out a yelp. The rest just go on about their business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA woman once took umbrage with my portrayal of white people, called me a \u201cblack gangbanger\u201d and asked me how that made me feel. I told her it did not bother me because I am not a gangbanger. I went about my business. Yet some white people are so racist that when we throw rocks at racism, they think we are targeting white people. They are hit dogs. That\u2019s why they holler.\n\nThe white people hollering at Questlove and driving their Rav4s back to the Toyota dealership will never be killed because The Root racially profiled them. The Root has never sent Fox News viewers\u2019 children to underfunded white schools. The Root doesn\u2019t subject Carlson\u2019s fans to longer prison sentences because they are white. The Root has never issued a travel ban against mediocre white boys or tried to deport the Caucasians who come to our country and take our jobs. But, to be fair, the entire staff at The Root wouldn\u2019t mind if someone built a wall around Fox News, but we don\u2019t have the funding.\n\nAnd some of them, we suppose, are good people.\n\nSo how will you settle this?\n\nWe probably won\u2019t. Historically, white people don\u2019t have a long record of taking shit back. Plus, the idea of a hip-hop beef between Fox News and The Root seems like fun. I don\u2019t know if Carlson is P. Diddy or Suge Knight in this scenario, but I bet Carlson won\u2019t be talking that shit when I roll up with The Root staff and the X-Men in my used 4Runner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo you don\u2019t feel bad at all?\n\nI\u2019ll be honest. There was one small part of the clip that made me feel a little bad about this entire Caucasian kerfuffle: when Tucker Carlson looked into the camera and said this:\n\nAttacking people on the basis of their race is wrong. That was the standard, and for a long time almost everybody in America believed it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI won\u2019t lie.

It\u2019s one of the most accepted aphorisms of all time, because hate is easy. Hate gets to conceal its identity under white sheets and pointed hoods as it lights crosses on lawns. Hate hides behind computer screens and anonymously hurls the n-word on social media. Hate smiles in your face and stabs you in New York City\u2019s Times Square.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s why haters hate\u2014because there are no consequences. It is easy to spread racism and prejudice when there is no fear of repercussions. If there were someone fearless and committed enough to unmask the faces of hatemongers, maybe haters would have second thoughts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeet Daryle Lamont Jenkins\u2014neo-Nazi hunter.\n\n\n\nFor more than 30 years, Jenkins has dedicated his life to chasing down white supremacists and exposing them to the glare of public scrutiny. His unapologetic style of reap-what-you-sow justice mixes the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s meticulous method of cataloging hate groups with the guerrilla vigilantism of Anonymous. Jenkins is relentless in his quest to drag fascists out of the shadows and into the disinfecting sunlight, and has amassed a network of photographers, reporters and regular citizens dedicated to his cause.\n\n\u201cI was always interested in this stuff,\u201d said Jenkins, a native of Somerset, N.J. \u201cWhen I saw pictures and news footage of Klansmen and people terrorizing activists during the civil rights era, I always wondered, \u2018Where did these people go?\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat simple quest sent him on a mission that eventually blossomed into his life\u2019s work. He became obsessed with newspaper articles and press clippings about Ku Klux Klan rallies, but it was The Oprah Winfrey Show that jump-started him into the arena of public activism.\n\n\u201cOprah was where I really started. In the late \u201980s, she did a show on skinheads,\u201d Jenkins told The Root in an exclusive one-on-one interview. \u201cBack then, the only way I had to save this information was to record it on videotape. I taped that first show and began saving all of this information. I still have all of those videos.\u201d\n\nAs a member of the alternative music and punk rock scene, Jenkins adopted the underground \u201cfanzine\u201d method of publicity and began sharing his information with others, and even started his own cable-access show. He scanned the New York area\u2019s burgeoning conservative radio programs and began to notice the growing connections between the conservative movement and the fringe right.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese mainstream, right-wing hosts like Bob Grant would regularly have guests like Jared Taylor on their radio shows,\u201d said Jenkins.\n\nThe SPLC, one of the country\u2019s most well-known and respected organizations that document hate groups for media and law-enforcement agencies, describes Taylor as a \u201ccourtly presenter of ideas that most would describe as crudely white supremacist\u2014a kind of modern-day version of the refined but racist colonialist of old.\u201d\n\nIn 1999, Jenkins started a small website dedicated to revealing the ties between fringe groups and the conservative movement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis was back in the days before everybody was on the internet,\u201d he reminisced. \u201cThis was a Geocities website!\u201d\n\nAfter a few minutes with Jenkins, you begin to wonder why he even needs a website, or videotapes, because he seems to have an encyclopedic memory of racist groups and individuals that borders on being a rare form of white supremacist savant. He spits out the names of harbingers of hate as if he knows them personally\u2014and, in a sense, he does.\n\nOne of the many names that Jenkins rattled off was Bob Grant\u2019s talk-radio successor, who caught Jenkins\u2019 attention more than two decades ago. In 1996, Jenkins discovered a radio show on New York\u2019s WABC, and he has kept his eye on its host ever since. In Jenkins\u2019 view, this host\u2019s ascendance to fame epitomizes how mainstream media enables extremists by giving them platforms to spread their message. \u201cI mean, this guy would promote guests like Hal Turner, a white nationalist from North Bergen [N.J.], who ran for Congress,\u201d Jenkins explained. \u201cBut if you even mention Hal Turner now, he will ban you from his show!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cthis guy\u201d to whom Jenkins refers is Fox News commentator, and right-wing superhero, Sean Hannity.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust Sean Hannity when it comes to race,\u201d said Jenkins. \u201cFor one thing, he constantly defends white people who use the n-word. People like Dog the Bounty Hunter, Don Imus and Dr. Laura Schlessinger. He seems to love the nastiest elements of the far right.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHate has consequences.\u201d\n\nThat simple sentence is the motto and clarion call for One People\u2019s Project, an organization dedicated to researching and reporting on \u201cright-wing groups, individuals and activities, and encourages society to be vigilant against them in an effort to diminish their ability to function and cause that society harm.\u201d Jenkins started the project and website in 2000 after Richard Barrett, leader of the white nationalist group the Nationalist Movement, organized a rally in Morristown, N.J.\n\nNoticing the rise of hate groups in the Northeast, Jenkins realized that the mainstream press seemed unconcerned. \u201cIf they won\u2019t cover it, we will\u201d was the mantra with which Jenkins began One People\u2019s Project. Since starting the group, Jenkins has enlisted journalists, photographers, videographers and anyone who wants to expose organized hate groups. Over the years, One People\u2019s Project has outed legions of racists through its \u201cRogues Gallery\u201d\u2014a database of individuals who have demonstrable extremist ties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of Jenkins\u2019 most used tactics is simply attending white nationalist conferences and taking photos and video. Instead of concentrating on the known figures, Jenkins wants to find the troublemakers before they explode. He scans crowds with his camera at neofascist rallies and events and later examines the footage, trying to cross-reference it with other internet data and social media.\n\nOne People\u2019s Project had photos of James O\u2019Keefe in 2006, years before he secretly taped, and heavily edited, videos that led to the demise of the community group ACORN. In the pictures, O\u2019Keefe poses with members of a white nationalist group and Andrew Breitbart, a then barely known publisher of a different kind of website named after himself.\n\nJenkins also utilizes \u201csock puppets\u201d\u2014fake social media accounts used to befriend people in hate groups, get on their friends\u2019 lists and see where the trail leads. It sometimes yields interesting discoveries. In 2014, when Anna Zubkova was running for a judgeship in Plainfield, Conn., One People\u2019s Project found her husband\u2019s white supremacist blog and blasted it to the national media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of One People\u2019s Project\u2019s most controversial practices is \u201cdoxxing\u201d white nationalists. Popularized by the secretive internet group Anonymous, doxxing (from \u201cdocumenting\u201d) is the activity of publicizing someone\u2019s name, address and private information. While many people debate the issue, Jenkins\u2019 stance on the topic is unwavering: \u201cI\u2019m not sorry to say, I don\u2019t have sympathy for white supremacists.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, One People\u2019s Project doxxed John Stortstrom, an Army engineer with security clearance who worked at the Army\u2019s chemical and explosive facility. The Project posted his picture and job description after Stortstrom attended a white nationalist conference with 150 other extremists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s run for the White House forced mainstream media to take note of the so-called alt-right\u2014a term Jenkins hates. \u201cI call them white supremacists; neo-fascists. \u2018Alt-right\u2019 is their term to try to clean themselves up. We have to be careful not to allow them to change the narrative and slip into the mainstream,\u201d the crusader warned.\n\nTrumpmania has also brought attention to One People\u2019s Project. In the past year, Jenkins has made appearances on The Rachel Maddow Show and Today. A&E planned a show based on Jenkins confronting KKK members called Generation KKK and then Escaping the KKK, but the network canceled the show when it discovered that field producers had paid some interviewees.\n\nNone of this publicity has slowed Jenkins down in his pursuit of fascists. He has started an auxiliary site to One People\u2019s Project called IdaVoxx\u2014a news site named after civil rights activist and journalist Ida B. Wells. He is also scouring the social media accounts of white supremacist and alleged Times Square stabber James Jackson to see with whom he might be connected. If he finds anything, you can be sure that Daryle Lamont Jenkins will put them on blast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaid Jenkins: \u201cThere\u2019s a story about Rage Against the Machine singer Tom Morello, who once quit his job because he was reprimanded for telling someone they were racist. I\u2019m just like Tom\u2014if there\u2019s anyplace where I can\u2019t call a racist a racist, I don\u2019t want to be there!\u201d", "keywords": ["supremacists", "man", "groups", "taking", "project", "ass", "peoples", "jenkins", "white", "media", "nationalist", "hate", "racist", "kicking", "started", "literally", "names"], "polarity": -0.015062378290533633, "subjectivity": 0.4217832329482815},

I was in high school, and like many other kids who knew how to use the internet at that time, I was frequently solicited with musical requests once my parents got wind that there was a tool that could let you download all the Roberta Flack, Anita Baker and Stevie Ray Vaughan songs you could possibly want\u2014and for free.\n\nIt\u2019s how I learned about Edith Piaf, Claude Debussy\u2019s \u201cClair de Lune\u201d and Luciano Pavarotti\u2019s rendition of \u201cNessun Dorma.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn an episode of the podcast Still Processing, New York Times writers Wesley Morris and Jenna Wortham pay tribute to Whitney Houston. Morris, gushing about \u201cI Will Always Love You,\u201d says that there is a sort of chemical reaction that happens in your brain when you hear Houston hit those high notes. It\u2019s the perfect way to describe how I felt about hearing Pavarotti hit that final chord change at the end of \u201cNessun Dorma,\u201d and what\u2019s kept me coming back to that aria ever since.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s been said that the sublime quality of Aretha Franklin\u2019s voice comes from its ability to be many things at once: rich and earthy, clear and light. I feel the same way about Pavarotti\u2019s tenor; it\u2019s instantly recognizable. A voice that has both grace and power, heft and brightness. I didn\u2019t know a damn thing about opera and can\u2019t speak Italian, but by sheer repetition, I learned all the words to \u201cNessun Dorma.\u201d And I know I\u2019m far from the only one who\u2019s experienced this.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I saw that Turandot, the opera in which \u201cNessun Dorma\u201d is featured, was playing at the Metropolitan Opera House, I knew I had found the perfect entry point into an art form that always felt a bit beyond my reach. I haven\u2019t done a whole lot of fine-artsy things in New York City, and had resolved that I should do better with my time than sit in my apartment and scroll through Netflix. New York City is one of the places in the world where great opera is so accessible: It wasn\u2019t difficult to find a ticket for a weekday performance for about $40.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until just before the night of the show that, prompted by a reminder email from the Met, I decided to review Turandot\u2019s synopsis. As I scanned the plot points, my heart sank. Giacomo Puccini had set the opera in China; the story was about a foreigner in Beijing determined to win the heart of a Chinese princess who had a nasty habit of killing her suitors.\n\n\n\nFor the most part the world of opera has been insulated from the sort of widespread criticism that\u2019s dogged film and television\u2014primarily because it\u2019s not as accessible to the American public in general, and people of color in particular.\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe story was about a China of the Western imagination\u2014a fact that I could live with because, as an Asian American in her 30s, I have lived with it; I\u2019m used to being forced to see Asia through that lens. What stung was that I knew this work of art based on a Chinese city, centered on Chinese characters, would be played by white opera singers.\n\n\n\nAsians are frequently erased in Hollywood, even in stories that take place in their cities and communities, and that originate with Asian or Asian-American characters. While some operatic performances have drawn criticism for leaning too far into caricature, for the most part the world of opera has been insulated from the sort of widespread criticism that\u2019s dogged film and television\u2014primarily because it\u2019s not as accessible to the American public in general, and people of color in particular.\n\n\n\nThere are places that instantly make me feel as though I\u2019m part of something much greater and grander than myself: cathedrals, mountains, the cheese section at Whole Foods. The Metropolitan Opera House instantly became one of those places.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is a grand staircase that leads you to each level of the opera house, from the orchestra section to the \u201cfamily\u201d section\u2014aka the nosebleeds\u2014where I sat. It\u2019s easy to forget you\u2019re in the cheap seats because nothing about the Met feels cheap: The floors and walls are covered in red velvet. Chandeliers set the light off in a million directions. And from the top floor, you can look down upon the Grand Tier restaurant, where the clinking of silver forks and champagne flutes reminds you that there are people who go to opera houses just to eat.\n\nBefore the opera even began, I was in awe.\n\n\n\nAnd then Turandot delivered.\n\n\n\nThere is that collective hush when you know everyone\u2019s eyes are anticipating the same thing, when your hearts are all in the same place (somewhere in your throat). Listening to \u201cNessun Dorma\u201d with hundreds of other operagoers felt like that.\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t know before that night is that operas are marathon affairs: The show began at 7:30 p.m. but wasn\u2019t scheduled to end until after 10 p.m. I was grateful for the two intermissions, but the time in between flew by. The set design was stunning, alternating between dark outdoor scenes and lavish palatial displays.\n\nUp top where I sat, some of the audience peered through binoculars at the singers below, who seemed like mere figurines to me. The truth is, I was grateful for the distance: It allowed me to focus on the music, the athletic leaps and runs of the singers\u2019 voices, without having to look at Eastern European faces peering out of imperial-Chinese costumes.\n\n\n\n(During the second intermission, I winced as I heard a couple behind me, speaking in a European accent I couldn\u2019t place, tell each other that the actors \u201creally looked Chinese!\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen \u201cNessun Dorma\u201d came, at the beginning of the third act, you could hear the entire house hold its breath\u2014for most of the audience, this is the song they came to hear. It didn\u2019t disappoint. I would liken it to when you\u2019re watching a basketball game and a crucial 3-point shot hangs in the air, just milliseconds before it reaches the net. There is that collective hush when you know everyone\u2019s eyes are anticipating the same thing, when your hearts are all in the same place (somewhere in your throat). Listening to \u201cNessun Dorma\u201d with hundreds of other operagoers felt like that.\n\n\n\nI left the Met that night thinking I had just experienced one of the most beautiful pieces of art I had ever encountered. I felt immensely lucky and privileged to have witnessed it. It was also true that I felt uncomfortable, not just for the unease I felt as Europeans portrayed Asian characters, but also because I was reminded of the sort of compromises that people of color are frequently forced to make when engaging with fine art. I fell in love with opera that night, and I hope to go to another show at the Met, but there are two aspects of the experience that have stayed with me.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI didn\u2019t have a full view of the stage from where I sat. There was a panel at the top of the stage that partially obscured my view: Anything placed at the top, toward the back of the stage, was hidden from me. It didn\u2019t stop me from enjoying the show, although I periodically wondered what I was missing, how my view was different from what one saw from the seats in other parts of the house.\n\n\n\nI wondered, then, if being a person of color trying to engage with Western fine art wasn\u2019t a matter of having the art obscured but of seeing too much.\ufeff\n\nI thought about whether being a person of color and engaging with fine art in the West wasn\u2019t a bit like this, to always be relegated to a back seat, someone whose view of the work is forever compromised by your position, your designation as a secondary audience.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI also remember my relief at those blurred faces, how the absence of their lips, eyes and mouths allowed me to focus on the art. I knew that seeing a white woman, her eyes painted and arched to resemble a Chinese princess, would break my heart\u2014not because it was so singularly awful, but because the offense was so persistent as to become banal.\n\n\n\nAnd I felt the isolation of that heartbreak, because I also knew that most of the audience wouldn\u2019t notice. I wondered, then, if being a person of color trying to engage with Western fine art wasn\u2019t a matter of having the art obscured but of seeing too much. Of being forced to see the granular details and blemishes that escaped other eyes.\n\n", "keywords": ["felt", "opera", "night", "knew", "nessun", "wasnt", "art", "color", "know", "tried", "eyes", "dorma"], "polarity": 0.13911653572764685, "subjectivity": 0.4224014216236439},

The suit was filed in New York County Supreme Court in Manhattan.\n\nAs the New York Daily News reports, Pirro\u2019s commentary stems from her coverage of a separate lawsuit filed against Mckesson and Black Lives Matter by an anonymous Baton Rouge police officer. Mckesson and BLM were in Baton Rouge to protest the fatal police shooting of Alton Sterling. The cop claimed that he was hit in the face with a rock by one of the protesters\u2014an assault, he said, that was directed by Mckesson.\n\nBut on Sept. 28, a federal judge threw out the suit because the officer couldn\u2019t provide any evidence that Mckesson incited the violence. The Louisiana judge also ruled that Black Lives Matter, as a social movement, could not be sued.\n\n\n\nThe lack of evidence didn\u2019t seem to matter to Pirro, a former Westchester County, N.Y., district attorney. She stuck to the anonymous officer\u2019s side of the story, naming McKesson as the organizer of the protest and telling Fox & Friends viewers that he was \u201cactually directing people, was directing the violence.\u201d\n\nBear in mind\u2014this was after the judge had ruled that there was no proof Mckesson did any of these things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a police officer who was injured; he was injured at the direction of DeRay Mckesson,\u201d Pirro said on the \u201cnews\u201d program. \u201cDeRay Mckesson walks away with $100,000, for an organization that is amorphous.

Although Pirro claimed via Twitter that her statements were based on the Baton Rouge cop\u2019s lawsuit, Mckesson pointed out that she had described them as though they were facts, not as though they were merely the officer\u2019s side of the story.\n\n\u201cThese statements of fact are false,\u201d reads Mckesson\u2019s suit, \u201cand were either known to be false by Defendant Pirro or were made with reckless disregard for whether they were true.\u201d\n\nLibel and defamation cases against media outlets are notoriously difficult to win because malicious intent needs to be proved (while getting facts wrong because of negligence can ruin an outlet\u2019s reputation, the First Amendment protects the media\u2019s right to get it wrong from time to time).

I did it because I have such a good heart and care about everyone. When I saw people making fun of how stupid they sound when they talk, I felt sorry for them.

I also taught them how to remove pee stains from the bedclothes.

The song samples her famous 1966 song \u201cFour Women,\u201d released on the Wild Is the Wind album. For those who were introduced to her through Jay-Z, I\u2019m both happy and sad: happy because at least they were introduced, and sad because that\u2019s a lot of good Nina Simone music they\u2019ve been missing out on.\n\n\u201cFour Women\u201d is one of the most powerful songs I\u2019ve ever heard in my entire life. From the piano riff that runs through the entire song, which is nothing short of heaven-sent in its perfection, to the buildup at the end to punctuate the emotions and the stories of the four women who are the essence of the song, \u201cFour Women\u201d brilliantly shares the various pain and struggles of black womanhood in America, as faced by these four black figures: Aunt Sarah, Saffronia, Sweet Thing and Peaches.\n\nAccording to an old Village Voice piece written by Thulani Davis after Simone passed away in 2003:\n\n\n\nBut it was \u201cFour Women,\u201d an instantly accessible analysis of the damning legacy of slavery, that made iconographic the real women we knew and would become. For African American women it became an anthem affirming our existence, our sanity, and our struggle to survive a culture which regards us as anti-feminine. It acknowledged the loss of childhoods among African American women, our invisibility, exploitation, defiance, and even subtly reminded that in slavery and patriarchy, your name is what they call you.\n\nAs a youth, I\u2019d heard Simone\u2019s music through my own discovery of new artists, but it (admittedly) wasn\u2019t until Kanye West sampled \u201cSinnerman\u201d for Talib Kweli\u2019s \u201cGet By\u201d in 2002 that I did a deep dive into her entire catalog. I spent a week digging into internet crates looking for every album I could find, trying to learn as much as I could.\n\nHer political messaging stood out to me particularly because of the timing and tone of a lot of her music\u2014so much was released in the heat of the civil rights movement\u2014and she didn\u2019t make any bones about her feelings over what was happening in America.\n\nFrom the Washington Post about the creation of the song \u201cMississippi Goddam\u201d:\n\nWhen Nina Simone heard about the bombing death of four young girls at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., in 1963, she famously went to her garage and tried to build a zip gun to take out her anger on someone. When her husband suggested that her music would be a more effective weapon, she wrote \u201cMississippi Goddam,\u201d a politically charged song that declared, \u201cLord have mercy on this land of mine / we all gonna get it in due time.\u201d When she released the song in 1964, it contained this curious, spoken aside: \u201cThis is a show tune, but the show hasn\u2019t been written for it yet.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFour Women\u201d follows along in that political ideology, and from the moment I first heard it, I was drawn into it. It\u2019s almost impossible not to feel something. She electrified us with her storytelling, and influenced other artists\u2014there are plays and works named in honor of the song\u2014by creating offerings that spoke to black womanhood in ways that resonated broadly, but particularly among black women.\n\nHer catalog contains so many gems that one listen through any greatest-hits compilation would whet your appetite for more. From \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Let Me Be Misunderstood\u201d to the aforementioned \u201cSinnerman\u201d and \u201cMississippi Goddam\u201d to \u201cI Put a Spell on You,\u201d you can find almost anything you\u2019re looking for from Nina Simone. She has over 30 albums for your choosing, but even among the many gems, \u201cFour Women\u201d stands out for its impact and purpose.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s why they call her Peaches, the last of the four women:", "keywords": ["history", "music", "black", "simones", "song", "perfect", "nina", "introduced", "released", "moments", "heard", "women", "mississippi", "simone"], "polarity": 0.11215200029855203, "subjectivity": 0.4679047245857591},

Considering the offended party\u2019s unusually high level of self-importance, it\u2019s unsurprising that a serious newsman made a pretend one lose it over criticism.\n\n\n\nEven so, though Koppel may have been correct in his assessment of Hannity and the damage that political opinion in news media is capable of, the segment itself was rooted in a false equivalence with respect to political opinion shows. Koppel, like many, continues to operate from the unfortunate space that all opinion shows are equal. However, the segment compares sound bites from John Oliver, who hosts a late-night cable political comedy show, and Michael Savage, a conservative radio host who fancies himself an activist\u2014and in doing so, it is helping to perpetuate a false dichotomy.\n\nOliver is a comedian who opines on politics, but his commentary is often well researched and, by and large, factual. The same goes for Samantha Bee and Trevor Noah. Those are folks whose first job is to be funny, not necessarily to inform. Nonetheless, a decade ago, a study by Pew Research highlighted that viewers of Comedy Central\u2019s The Daily Show (then hosted by Jon Stewart) and The Colbert Report held the \u201chighest knowledge of national and international affairs while Fox News viewers rank nearly dead last.\u201d So even if, seven years later, a separate Pew Research study noted that many people continued to identify those shows as legitimate news sources, other studies have shown that people do actually learn something.\n\nWhat are people learning from Tomi Lahren or Rush Limbaugh other than that many people miss the days of water fountains with access based on skin pigmentation?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther studies have shown that outlets such as Fox News and MSNBC have a negative impact on people\u2019s knowledge of current events, but I question anyone who would argue that Rachel Maddow is like Tucker Carlson, that Chris Hayes is anywhere near Bill O\u2019Reilly or that Joy-Ann Reid mirrors Megan Kelly in any way. The only person on Fox News worth listening to in terms of actual news is Shepard Smith. That doesn\u2019t mean Fox\u2019s opinion hosts are incapable of educating their viewers while sharing their respective ideology, but they opt not to.\n\nIt\u2019s not so much that opinion programming on news networks is the problem as it is that we are bombarded with uninformed opinions\u2014primarily because of a conservative media that\u2019s much more invested in playing into the racial and gender biases of its viewership than in educating them. When it comes to problems with news media, cries that it\u2019s too opinionated read as an oversimplification.\n\nWhat\u2019s MSNBC\u2019s problem? It could use far more color and a bit more youth. Oh, and in the case of the 6 p.m. hour on its Monday-to-Friday lineup, stop trying to make fetch happen with Greta Van Susteren. Simply chasing after old Fox News watchers isn\u2019t going to cut it. Soon enough, NBC will learn that with Kelly. Shoutout to Tamron Hall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for Fox News, well, drown that network and hand only Smith a life raft. That station is nothing but a dedication to the white establishment and willful ignorance. It is insulting to compare its mythology-peddling with people who bother to actually know about a given issue before commenting on it.\n\nNow, with CNN ... first, join me in prayer.\n\nObviously, not everyone is guilty of this, but the network (along with Fox News, whom it clearly jacked this from) has this incessant need to air hours upon hours of verbal jousting and call it news. That\u2019s actually infotainment, and nothing can be gleaned from that other than catharsis for those who need to see someone they don\u2019t agree with be yelled out. On that front, I agree with news veterans like Tom Brokaw who have rallied against the \u201cvicious\u201d tones flooding the news stations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAngela Rye is equal parts intelligent and talented, but subjecting her to former Rep. Joe Walsh seems wrong. Walsh is a racist who just makes up nonsense online to get on television and blab out a bunch of other nonsense. Koppel said this to Hannity, but it applies to Walsh, too, although not Rye: \u201cYou have attracted people who have determined that ideology is more important than facts.\u201d\n\nRye and Walsh are not on an equal footing.\n\nI\u2019m all for making the news media better and less intolerable to watch, but it\u2019s tiresome to continue hearing people make the \u201cboth sides do it\u201d argument in the name of objectivity. Objectivity is often a figment of people\u2019s imaginations. News anchors are not supposed to share their opinions, but they are supposed to tell the truth. Opinion anchors should be free to share their line of thinking, but it ought to come from a place rooted in facts. Unless people free the sensible conservatives locked in a closet somewhere and book them over the ones who simply want to hoot and holler for the sake of securing a cushy contract, stop equating each side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGet rid of the lying dummies, and Americans would be far less dumb and uninformed.

So imagine our surprise that one of the most melanin-rich presentations of the season almost escaped our notice: Maki Oh, by Nigerian designer Amaka Osakwe.\n\n\n\nBased in Lagos, Osakwe has been at the helm of her own label since 2010, and since that time she has become one of the few Nigerian designers to have a global reach. Her designs have been worn by Beyonc\u00e9, Kerry Washington and our forever first lady, Michelle Obama.\n\nThis season, Osakwe sent her models down the runway in a range of muted hues and quirky but sophisticated silhouettes and pattern combinations that seemed to evoke a type of nomadic chic. These immensely wearable clothes are for a woman who is not only worldly but also winsome, featuring wonderfully cut trousers, satiny sliplike pieces under suiting fabrics, and lam\u00e9 coats that I\u2019m literally swooning over.

The #MeToo founder has been rightfully getting her shine since the movement bearing the name she coined caught Hollywood\u2019s attention last fall. In the months since, she has appeared on red carpets, been honored in Time magazine, and become a regular on the talk and news show circuits.\n\nBut amid all the fanfare, the one thing Burke has never neglected is her mission to support and protect black and brown girls and women, a point she made abundantly clear when she appeared on Comedy Central\u2019s The Opposition With Jordan Klepper on Thursday\u2014her segment begins at the 15:31 mark.\n\n\u201cWe started #MeToo because it was an exchange of empathy between survivors, to let them know that they\u2019re not alone,\u201d she said.\n\nSince Klepper\u2019s show is satirical, he naturally played devil\u2019s advocate when discussing the need and motives of #MeToo, voicing the increasingly irrational concerns of men who likely feel that the movement endangers their right to sexual entitlement. When asked by Klepper about the danger of conflating sexual harassment and assault under the umbrella of a single hashtag, Burke illustrated the larger danger of ignoring the insidious nature of sexual harassment:\n\nThere\u2019s no conflation; there\u2019s actually a spectrum. And so, sexual harassment and sexual abuse and sexual violence are on a spectrum. On one end, we have sexual harassment, which creates hostile environments and make people uncomfortable and really open a gateway for more intense violence. So they can all live under the same hashtag.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe went on to point out that #MeToo\u2019s actual mission is \u201cempowerment through empathy\u201d\u2014a mission that we share here at The Glow Up. When Klepper playfully quipped that he thought empathy to be synonymous with weakness, Burke very seriously replied:\n\nEmpathy is actually the opposite of weakness; it is the power between two people. ... When one person says to another person, \u201cMe too,\u201d that person has shared something about a trauma that they experienced. The other person is empowered by that; it\u2019s the power in knowing that you\u2019re not alone, it\u2019s the power in knowing that somebody believes you, and hears you, and sees you, and is there for you.\n\nBut ever the comedian, Klepper wasn\u2019t done, ribbing Burke on why she continues to fix her social media gaze upon alleged serial sexual abuser and pedophile R. Kelly. Through Klepper\u2019s satirical lens, Kelly\u2019s only relevance should be related to his record releases. Burke coolly responded with the clapback of the night: \u201cYou know what else he hasn\u2019t released? The women that he\u2019s holding captive in houses in Atlanta and Chicago.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I tell you that I stood up and applauded and whooped with the studio audience! And as always, Burke brought the movement back to black and brown girls and their specific vulnerability\u2014and invisibility\u2014in discussions of sexual abuse.\n\n[P]eople tend to not care about things that affect the most marginalized amongst us. [Kelly\u2019s] victims, the people who he seeks out are vulnerable girls who come from vulnerable communities, and they look like me, mostly. ... [N]ow\u2014largely because of this movement\u2014we are bringing more attention to people like R. Kelly and hoping that we can take him down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll in all, in our current era of catchphrases, memes and passing trends, Burke\u2019s appearance on The Opposition was a cogent reminder that our collective work must continue, even\u2014no, especially\u2014amid all the well-deserved attention.

The four main women of Wakanda, played by Danai Gurira, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Letitia Wright and, of course, the legendary Angela Bassett. Throw in that badass Dora Milaje, and ... T\u2019Challa who?\n\nWe kid, we kid. Chadwick and Michael B. and Forest and them are great. But we\u2019d be lying if we said that the ladies haven\u2019t been stealing the scene these past few weeks.

Black-on-black beauty in full effect!\n\nBlack Panther aside, this is the new Fantastic Four\u2014femme-style!

I was running on minimal sleep and nursing a dehydration headache all day; and it was one of those cold, rainy fall days for which God invented cuffing season, malbec and Showtime Anytime. Lying immobile on my carpeted living room floor in the dark while watching SMILF seemed way more appealing.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve never been a huge fan of nightclubs in general, and I appreciate that being in my mid- to late 30s allows me to be nakedly hostile toward them, instead of having to craft excuses to my boys as to why I don\u2019t want to drop a dub to hear a DJ \u201cspin\u201d (read: shuffle through his iTunes playlist) songs from rappers with alternative-school-dropout bars. But I promised my boy Matty that I\u2019d go, and The Root that I\u2019d write about it, so I put on my big-boy Hanes, popped some Aleve and headed out to the Promontory, a restaurant-slash-performance venue in Chicago\u2019s \u201cdowntown\u201d Hyde Park neighborhood.\n\nUrban Fetes, a Chicago-based media agency, has thrown silent parties throughout the country all year. When Matty explained to me their basic conceit\u2014people gather to listen to music on headphones in a club environment\u2014my initial response was, \u201cSounds like some white-people shit.\u201d\n\nWhy would I want to pay to do something I can do in the crib while in my drawers eating dried mango slices? However, Matty assured me that the event would be rife with Negroes\u2014indeed, the group of bad sistas in leather pants walking with me on 53rd Street as we headed toward the Promontory gave me hope that it might not be so bad after all.\n\nI arrived at about 10:15, which allowed me to enter the venue pretty quickly; two hours later, there was a line down the stairs and out the door. They took my driver\u2019s license in exchange for a numbered card and a pair of over-ear headphones. A nice young lady gave me a 10-second tutorial: On the right earpiece is a volume knob; on the left, an on-off switch and a switch that cycles through three channels: blue, red and green.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEach channel corresponded to a DJ on the stage, playing his own set independent of the other two; the headphones light up like neon with the color connected to your channel. You can see what channel you\u2019re on by turning your eyes as far as they go to see the glow. Since I use Bluetooth cans daily, muscle memory made me dig for my iPhone every time I wanted to change a song; otherwise, the learning curve was not steep.\n\nThere were lots of attendees when I arrived\u2014a healthy smattering of both bougie and hood black folks, along with a handful of white and assorted-ethnicity folks who were probably students from the nearby University of Chicago. Despite the headphones, almost all of the regular club staples were present: the call-and-response from DJs, throwing elbows at the bar to get your woefully overpriced and watered-down Jack and Coke; and dudes ice-grilling you if you dare scuff their Timbs (OK, maybe I\u2019m projecting here).\n\nThe most interesting\u2014and surreal\u2014aspect of the silent party was watching people respond to widely disparate music. You\u2019re \u201cla-da-dee-la-da-doww\u201d-ing to Crystal Waters\u2019 \u201cGypsy Woman\u201d while there\u2019s a dude freaking his girl down on the bar, so you switch to their green and hear \u201cI was gettin\u2019, gettin\u2019 some head.\u201d Take your headphones off and it sounds like what happens if it were socially acceptable for a roomful of people to dance and sing loudly to the music only they\u2019re listening to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe biggest appeal of these parties, I\u2019m sure, is having the option of not listening to music you don\u2019t want to hear, something most nightclubs don\u2019t provide by design. There wasn\u2019t a discernible pattern on the green and blue stations\u2014just a mixture of old- and new-school rap and R&B. But because the event had a house theme (and because it\u2019s Chicago), the red channel played house music all night. Also because it\u2019s Chicago, R. Kelly\u2019s \u201cFeelin\u2019 on Yo\u2019 Booty\u201d came on twice that evening, and damn near no one changed the station.\n\nThe DJs did well with their blends and song selections throughout the night, but there were certainly moments when all three were not hitting at the same time. For me, one of the worst parts of the conventional club experience is being forced to listen to a song that makes me wanna pull my brains out of my nose with a coat hanger, so the option to completely disengage was welcome.\n\nThe other appeal of that disengagement is the ability to talk to people with your inside voice\u2014no Lil Wayne-breath-having dudes yelling, \u201cHEY, HELLO, WHERE YOU FROM? CAN I BUY YOU A DRINK?!?\u201d directly in your ear, motivating you to go home and activate a Tinder account to find your future husband. I met a woman simply by taking off my headphones, tapping her on the shoulder and introducing myself when she moved her earpiece.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharity, who admitted that she was 40 despite looking a smooth seven or eight years younger, said she believed that the silent party is a microcosm of how people function in our society today (people doing their own thing, heads buried in their smartphones), which is a stark contrast to the sociable, presmartphone clubbing she did in her 20s. That the silent party could be a by-product of Donald Trump\u2019s America made the whole thing a bit more \u2026 depressing.\n\nAround 1 a.m. is the only time I saw collaboration among the DJs: Each one instructed everyone to turn their channels to green. But one of them rambled over the channel about nothing before turning on something slow that had everyone standing still, so I took it as a sign to change the channel from green to \u201cDustin\u2019s pillow.\u201d Despite an ever growing line to return headphones for IDs, Urban Fetes did well with coordination, allowing me to get out with no problems.\n\n\n\nI enjoyed the experience of clubbing with a bunch of headphone-wearing folks far more than I expected to. Something that seems antisocial on its face actually manages to be more social and unique. Even if the idea of going out to a club makes you throw your index fingers in a cross as if Dracula is approaching\u2014and even if you, like me, are a card-carrying member of the get-off-my-lawn set\u2014a silent party is worth trying just once.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAttending instead of posting up on my carpet in front of the television was a good decision. Now, hitting up the dude selling jerk chicken and rib tips out of his truck outside the Promontory after 1 a.m. ... ? Not the finest 30-something decision.", "keywords": ["headphones", "music", "green", "club", "party", "notes", "promontory", "switch", "tried", "silent", "channel", "song"], "polarity": 0.05380729672821509, "subjectivity": 0.421921955595425},

Hyacinthe is one of the hardest-hustling creatives in New York City, crafting a hybrid career out of her two greatest passions: music and fashion. By day, the stylist and CEO of Immaculate Wardrobe dresses Fortune 500 female power brokers; by night, she\u2019s DJ Soda Pop, spinning hip-hop and house at Manhattan venues like the Museum of Sex\u2014where she launches a weekly residency tonight.\n\nThe Glow Up recently caught up with the busy Bronx-born beauty to discuss her parallel creative careers and her future as a fashion DJ. The product of what she describes as a traditional Haitian-American family, Hyacinthe grew up on a steady diet of hip-hop and haute couture, influenced by three older brothers and a style-obsessed stepsister. Her own obsession with fashion began so early, she recalls cutting out and stashing Vogue spreads under her pillowcase, just so she could wear the outfits in her dreams:\n\nI remember being in school\u2014we had to list our skills, what we were good at. And the only thing I [could] think of was that I can put clothes together nicely. ... And I remember picking up\u2014it was Vibe magazine\u2014and they used to have the fashion editorials, and I saw [celebrity fashion stylist] June Ambrose. And they had this article, and I remember it led with \u201cstyle architect,\u201d and I was just like, \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to do!\u201d She was a major inspiration. ... I just saw her, and I was like, \u201cThis is what I aspire to be.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, it was a mentoring program led by image activist Michaela angela Davis that would be the conduit for bringing Hyacinthe\u2019s aspirations to fruition\u2014and would teach her a powerful lesson in asking for what you want:\n\nIt all starts with Michaela; she was running something called Salon du Shine at her house, where there\u2019d be a group of, like, 10 of us girls [getting] together in her loft in Brooklyn. And we would just talk about stuff, you know. And I remember going up to Michaela, like, \u201cCan you introduce me to June Ambrose?\u201d And she was just like, \u201cI don\u2019t know ... June is super-busy.\u201d I kid you not: A couple of days later, Michaela calls me and she says, \u201cJune is looking for an intern.\u201d... So I went to the interview\u2014June\u2019s two assistants at the time, they tore me to pieces\u2014but I wound up getting the internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile interning for Ambrose, Hyacinthe also worked full time to put herself through the Fashion Merchandising Management program at New York City\u2019s Berkeley College. It was the beginning of a career path that her Haitian parents, unfortunately, didn\u2019t understand:\n\nMy parents\u2014although they were very loving\u2014they didn\u2019t understand the concept of me wanting to be a stylist and me being in a creative field; it was foreign to them. ... They didn\u2019t have the opportunity to dream as we do, and I think because of that, they\u2019re unable to\u2014they\u2019re in a sense blind to that. ... So I wound up having to put myself through college; I worked full time [in retail] and I did this internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorking for Ambrose taught Hyacinthe how the editorials she once obsessed over were created, but it was working in retail that helped her find her niche: helping busy professional women build their wardrobes.\n\nI would work with clients, and they\u2019d be like, \u201cSophia, I love working with you; you style me so well. I wish you could come dress me at home.\u201d And one day I actually got the courage to say, \u201cWell, I can.\u201d ... So this one client took me up on it, and I went to her house and started with her closet. But then she had me speak with her career coach, and that\u2019s when it really clicked: This is on another level. Like, you know, female executives really need this. And I really found the value that I could add.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIdentifying her core clientele and their unique need to possess a high-end wardrobe without having the time to curate or shop for it, Hyacinthe launched her company, Immaculate Wardrobe. The self-described \u201cwardrobe whisperer\u201d currently dresses about 20 clients, all of whom are powerful women who inspire her daily, as she explained:\n\n\n\nI work primarily with female boss bitches. These are women that are working [as] CEOs of companies, and they\u2019re also moms. ... I feel like it\u2019s really important for me to surround myself with these powerful women. And I feel like since they\u2019re at the top of their companies, not only am I empowering them, but also the women that come [into their companies] that\u2019ve just graduated from college ... to see that someone at the top of their career is not only killing it, but also killing it with style.\n\nBut while helping other women fulfill their potential, Hyacinthe also realized an opportunity to further fulfill her own. A longtime avid lover of music, she was often critical of DJs on the New York City nightclub scene. Challenged by an exasperated friend to learn for herself, she accepted his gift of a DJ class at New York\u2019s famed Rock & Soul record store. Instantly, another passion was born, along with an alter ego: DJ Soda Pop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike her styling career, Hyacinthe\u2019s growth as a DJ has been simultaneously organic and self-driven. She initially asked more-established DJs for opening slots and cultivated her own contacts and connections. It\u2019s a path that called into conflict the hip-hop-loving girl from New York\u2019s Bronx borough and the cultured style expert whom elite businesswomen entrust with their wardrobes:\n\n\n\nGrowing up in my family, I grew up listening to Reasonable Doubt, to Onyx, to Nas\u2014like, really hard music. Like, I\u2019m very feminine and girly now, but I grew up liking really hard-core rap. I\u2019ve always known that I\u2019ve had this love and passion for music, but it was, \u201cOK, Sophia, either you can pursue fashion styling or you can be a DJ.\u201d I didn\u2019t think in my mind\u2014I couldn\u2019t fathom the idea of me flourishing in both fields ... [But] to be honest with you, I can\u2019t exist with one without the other. ... I feel like they feed into each other so much, especially the route that I want to go. ... I want to be New York\u2019s new fashion DJ, and there\u2019s not enough of us brown girls up there that are actually doing it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile her dual careers may seem to be a study in contrasts, Hyacinthe approaches both spinning and styling instinctively, using unexpected textural combinations to evoke new feelings. And in the process of embracing her dual passions, her own identity fell into place.\n\nI feel like deejaying has really helped me fully come into my skin. ... Even with race: It\u2019s like before, I thought that I needed to kind of neglect my own identity to be accepted. And I know I\u2019m not the only one that feels that way; as a black woman in the fashion industry, which is predominantly white. I thought that I needed to strip some of my identity\u2014the fact that I listened to hip-hop, the fact that I loved it, the fact that I came from the Bronx\u2014I thought that I almost needed to move away from that in order for me to be seen in society as being this elegant person in fashion ... [but] I feel like once you accept yourself, they have no choice but to accept you for who you are. And I feel like deejaying has really allowed me to accept myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re in the New York City area, you can catch DJ Soda Pop every Thursday night at the Museum of Sex at 233 Fifth Ave. She launches her weekly residency Thursday night with a viewing party for RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race.", "keywords": ["fashion", "dressed", "double", "night", "really", "feel", "york", "inside", "career", "think", "hyacinthe", "sophia", "dj", "wardrobe", "women", "life", "dope"], "polarity": 0.16347579051383396, "subjectivity": 0.5693305335968378},

Henson, who reportedly dropped him as a manager over the weekend, issued a statement saying he was out of the game.\n\n\u201cIt is with incredibly great sadness that at this time, I believe it\u2019s in the best interests of all my actors and actresses that I represent to close my management company. This business is hard enough and I don\u2019t want to distract in any way from their careers or opportunities in the entertainment field. I wish all the people I represent the very best in all their future endeavors,\u201d Cirrincione said a statement to Deadline.\n\nBerry had reportedly dropped Cirrincione some years back over allegations that he used her name to come on to up-and-coming actresses.\n\nEarlier:\n\n\n\nA prominent manager of African-American talent that once included Halle Berry and currently includes Taraji P. Henson is the latest man in Hollywood to be accused of sexual harassment. This time, nine women of color\u2014eight black, one Asian\u2014have accused Vincent Cirrincione of unwanted sexual advances (and, of course, public masturbation) over a period beginning in 1993 and ending in 2011.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Washington Post broke the story Friday. Cirrincione allegedly used his prominence to \u201cprey upon young women of color seeking an entry into Hollywood,\u201d according to the report.\n\nThe first woman cited in the article, Tamika Lamison, says that she was 27 years old when she was at Cirrincione\u2019s hotel room for an impromptu audition after the Tony Awards when Berry called. Cirrincione put the star on speaker. The Post reports:\n\nWhen the call ended, Lamison began reciting a poem she had written. Midway through her performance, she said Cirrincione grabbed her and started kissing her, sticking his tongue in her mouth. She said he told her that he could take her on as a client, on the condition that he would get to see her for sex whenever he wanted. She said she pushed him away and left.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf the nine women, three say that Cirrincione pushed for sex as a condition of representing them, and that he did not take them on when they refused. A fourth said that he offered to help advance her career if she agreed to have sex with him monthly. A fifth actress said that he masturbated in front of her in his office during the years he managed her.\n\nBerry reportedly cut ties with Cirrincione three years ago after hearing about the allegations against him.\n\n\n\n\u201cOver three years ago, a woman was on the radio saying that Halle Berry\u2019s manager was her worst casting couch experience ever. That news literally stopped me in my tracks. I immediately confronted Vince about it, and he denied it completely. But even with his denial, something didn\u2019t feel right in my spirit, and with the possibility that it could be true, I immediately ended our over-25-year relationship,\u201d she told the Post.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Post reports that Cirrincione and Berry co-produced Introducing Dorothy Dandridge for HBO in 1999.\n\nOn Friday, Berry spoke out again on Instagram, saying she\u2019s \u201clivid that [Cirrincione] used me.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBerry said that the manager had never made an inappropriate gesture toward her.\n\n\n\nHenson, who has been managed by Cirrincione for two decades, said that she never heard of or witnessed any inappropriate behavior by Cirrincione toward women.\n\nIn fact, she says, he really helped her when she was struggling.\n\n\u201cHe saw a single mother trying to make her dreams come true, and he nurtured that,\u201d Henson told the Post. \u201cHe wrote checks and wouldn\u2019t ask for anything in return. It wasn\u2019t coming from a creepy place. If anything, it empowered me. Like, this man believes in me. I love him for that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs with Berry, Cirrincione has also been Henson\u2019s producing partner; Henson\u2019s publicist, Pam Sharp, is Cirrincione\u2019s longtime girlfriend, according to the Post.\n\nIn a statement, Cirrincione responded to the criticisms:\n\nWe live in a time where men are being confronted with a very real opportunity to take responsibility for their actions. I support this movement wholeheartedly. I have had female clients and employees my entire career in this industry. I have built a reputation for advancing the careers of women of color. I have had affairs while in committed relationships, ones I am now ashamed to say are coming to light and shading my past and my reputation. I can say without a doubt that I have never used favors, sexual or otherwise, as a reason for managing anyone. I want to make it clear that not one of those relationships were anything but consensual. I take responsibility for my part in the situation and I am not here to diminish anyone\u2019s feelings or experiences. I apologize to these women, my past and present partner, my clients and employees for the pain this is bringing them. I was under the impression I was living my life as a supportive man to women. It is with a heavy heart that I see now I was wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of the nine women make accusations of rape or criminal misconduct. Only three have used their names publicly because they say they feared (and still fear) repercussions.\n\n", "keywords": ["hollywood", "reportedly", "blackadjacent", "used", "shuts", "agency", "manager", "berry", "vincent", "cirrincione", "say", "allegations", "amid", "post", "told", "women", "harassment", "sexual"], "polarity": 0.10151600033952973, "subjectivity": 0.4795098039215686},

Reeves went on to show how the flag was used during segregation, tracing its lineage all the way to Mississippi\u2019s secession, pointing out that the state had declared, \u201cOur position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery\u2014the greatest material interest of the world.\u201d\n\nMoore, who I presume gave Judge Reeves some dap and said, \u201cGood looking out, bruh,\u201d after he read the decision, appealed on the grounds that the flag has actually caused him legal injury, citing the fact that he has a daughter who should be protected from white supremacist symbols via the U.S. Constitution\u2019s \u201cequal protection\u201d clause. Moore is also an attorney, and his new appeal explains why the 5th Circuit\u2019s ruling was wrong, stating:\n\nA city could adopt \u2018White Supremacy Forever\u2019 as its official motto; or a county could incorporate an image of white hooded figures and a noose hanging from a tree into its county seal; or a state could incorporate a Nazi swastika, as an endorsement of Aryan/white supremacy, in its state flag.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile I\u2019ve always thought that Mississippi\u2019s motto was already \u201cWhite supremacy forever\u201d (not to be confused with Alabama\u2019s state motto, \u201cWhite supremacy forever. Roll Tide!\u201d), the state has recently considered legislation to remove the Confederate symbol from its flag. Several cities in Mississippi have already stopped flying the flag, as have all eight of the state\u2019s public universities.\n\nMany people (pronounced \u201ccaw-cajuns\u201d) argue that the flag is a symbol of history and Southern heritage. They say the flag does not promote hate or white supremacy but instead is a reminder of the legacy of the old South.\n\nThose people are idiots.\n\nIn fact, after the Civil War ended, no one\u2014not even the vanquished Southern rednecks\u2014thought about the rebel flag until blacks began to push for civil rights, desegregation and equality under the law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, William T. Thompson, the man who designed the Confederate flag, even wrote:\n\nAs a people we are fighting to maintain the heavenly ordained supremacy of the white man over the inferior or colored race; a white flag would thus be emblematical of our cause. Such a flag would be a suitable emblem of our young confederacy, and sustained by the brave hearts and strong arms of the south, it would soon take rank among the proudest ensigns of the nations, and be hailed by the civilized world as THE WHITE MAN\u2019S FLAG.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Supreme Court won\u2019t announce whether it will hear Moore\u2019s case until at least October.\n\nRead more at the Associated Press.", "keywords": ["supreme", "man", "supremacy", "black", "flag", "moores", "court", "white", "moore", "reeves", "symbol", "state", "miss", "takes", "look", "ruling"], "polarity": 0.013604797979797975, "subjectivity": 0.36172664141414135},

But as she tells Allure in its March issue, her own journey to choosing to wear her hair in its natural state was a very different one from the almost instantaneous success she enjoyed after being cast in her Oscar-winning role in 12 Years a Slave.\n\nAs a tween in Kenya, Nyong\u2019o was teased and felt \u201creally unpretty\u201d in comparison with her classmates\u2014who almost all wore their hair relaxed. Her mother wanted her to wait until near adulthood to relax her hair but eventually acquiesced to her daughter\u2019s pleas. Nyong\u2019o explains:\n\nShe took me to the salon in the middle of the school day, and I got my hair relaxed. I felt so much better because it was easier to tame. All the girls in my class had their hair relaxed. Very few had natural kink, so I felt a lot more acceptable. I had my hair relaxed for most of my teenage years, and that was a whole other world. The upkeep of relaxed hair is a commitment. It took styling it once a week and then having it retouched once a month. I remember doing crazy things, like sleeping with my head above the headboard so that my curls wouldn\u2019t get messed up for the next day. I\u2019d have these terrible neck aches because I was determined to keep my hair as pristine as possible. And it was super expensive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, Nyongo\u2019s conversion back to natural hair began in response to a joke from her father while she was asking him for money to support her relaxer habit: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just cut it all off?\u201d he said. She did, having her head shaved completely bald, a choice that she told Allure was \u201cliberating.\u201d\n\nBut the choice wasn\u2019t a cure-all; Nyong\u2019o struggled with managing her texture for years, especially after moving to the northeastern United States for college and graduate school:\n\nMoving to the U.S. was very difficult because I didn\u2019t have the same kind of support system. [Braiding] services were not readily available in Amherst, Massachusetts. For a long time I would braid my hair in Kenya and then spend months with the braids in when I got to the States so that I didn\u2019t have to worry about my hair. Also, my hair did something very different in freezing weather, which I didn\u2019t know how to handle. My hair needs moisture. It needs warmth. All of a sudden I was in this very cold environment, and my hair was bristly and dry and really hard to manage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while it was Nyong\u2019o\u2019s work with famed stylist Ted Gibson that got many inspired about the versatility of natural hair, it was her current stylist, Vernon Franc\u0327ois, who helped her learn how to manage and care for her natural texture, thanks in large part to his eponymous line of products/ (Franc\u0327ois also provided some insight and tips on how he created the looks for Nyong\u2019o\u2019s Allure cover shoot.)\n\nNyong\u2019o says:\n\n\n\nOne thing I\u2019ve learned was the acronym LOC, and that\u2019s basically the rule for how to treat my hair: liquid, oil, and then cream. It\u2019s the idea that you wet your hair first, then you add oil so that it can trap the moisture in, then you put a moisturizer or a cream over it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNyong\u2019o says that this is the longest her hair has been in a decade. And while we\u2019re guessing that a few extras were added to create the cloudlike coifs she rocks in Allure\u2019s March issue, we\u2019re liking the look on her. We can\u2019t wait to see where her natural-hair journey might take her next.", "keywords": ["natural", "hair", "felt", "didnt", "wait", "allure", "nyongos", "nyongo", "lupita", "journey", "takes", "relaxed", "took"], "polarity": 0.02315238095238094, "subjectivity": 0.4495380952380952},

I\u2019m working on myself as a human being, and yoga calls to me more than anything else ever has. I love yoga, I practice yoga at minimum three times a week, I teach yoga a few times a week and I read all the yoga books.\n\n\n\nIn my few years of consistent practice, I\u2019ve noticed long-standing benefits, not only physically but mentally. I\u2019m less anxious; I\u2019m more mellowed out; I\u2019m more patient \u2026 the list goes on and on.\n\n\n\nBut I\u2019m nowhere near perfect. And this past year alone is testing the very limits of my already extensive practice. So after a lot of reading and enjoying my brief meditations in savasana (corpse pose) at the end of my yoga classes, I decided to take the next obvious step in this journey: daily meditations.\n\n\n\nAnd boy, do I use the word \u201cdaily\u201d loosely.\n\n\n\nI took my first stab at meditation a few months back and quickly learned that unguided, the just-me-sitting-down-and-meditating type of vibe wasn\u2019t going to work, at least not just yet. My mind would not settle for the life of me. I just ended up creating to-do lists in my brain for the remainder of the day or daydreaming or something or other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt didn\u2019t work out. I gave up for a while but then came crawling back because 2017 is a flaming dump truck of trash.\n\nAnd because this is 2017, the year of the smartphone and all the apps, I Googled a few meditation options and gave them a shot. They were all right. But nothing really held my attention or spoke to me until a little earlier this month, when a yogi co-worker told me about Insight Timer (not sponsored, I promise). I really enjoyed how all-encompassing it was, and it being a free app didn\u2019t hurt, either. Whatever your interests were, whatever type of guided meditation or music you were looking for, you could search by religion, by topic, by feelings, by the time of day.\n\nSo far, using this app, I\u2019ve managed to meditate for the past 11 consecutive days. Sometimes it\u2019s once a day. Sometimes I manage twice per day, right when I get up and right when I\u2019m about to go to bed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the span of those 11 days, I\u2019ve learned a lot about myself.\n\nThe first thing that struck me was: Holy shit am I a fidgeter.\n\nI\u2019ve never thought of myself as someone who has tics or can\u2019t sit still for extended periods of time. After 11 days of meditation, I have now learned that this is simply not true. I cannot sit still for the life of me. The longest I\u2019ve ever managed to meditate (guided, mind you) is 15 minutes, and even then, every few minutes I have to scratch something or adjust my seat or wiggle my fingers or my toes or roll out my neck. It\u2019s almost comical. But like I said, work in progress. And would you know, since observing this in myself through meditation, I\u2019ve been more aware of my fidgets when I\u2019m working at my day job?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe second thing I noticed was how well I was sleeping at night.\n\nThis probably surprised me the most.\n\nI\u2019m nowhere near a good or efficient sleeper. My sleep schedule is crap and inconsistent (I can sleep anywhere between four and seven hours, depending), which is a recipe for disaster for anyone\u2019s circadian rhythm. And so even when I do sleep for a good amount of time, it never feels restful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m also one of the many people on this planet who is bombarded by their brain when they\u2019re trying to fall asleep. So there I would be, lying in bed, thinking of a thousand different scenarios where \u201cx\u201d and \u201cy\u201d equal \u201cz\u201d while plotting out the rest of my week or thinking of things that happened in high school.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nAnd then I started doing these meditations, and one of two things started happening. Either a) I fall asleep mid meditation, missing out on the whole experience, but that\u2019s fine because I\u2019m out like a light; or b) I\u2019m not that tired, so I make it through a fidgety session but then drop right off and sleep peacefully throughout the night.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has seriously been magical. I can\u2019t tell the last time I\u2019ve felt this well-rested in my life. Part of me would like to think that through meditation, I compartmentalize and start to let go of the thoughts that plague me during the day. I start to disassociate myself from what has happened or will happen (cue hippie, yoga voice here), draw my attention inward, and by the time I\u2019m ready for bed, I\u2019m soothed and settled and my mind isn\u2019t racing at 500 mph, making it easier not only to fall asleep but also to stay that way.\n\nTurns out for me, meditating and sorting through my head is better than ZzzQuil. Who\u2019d have thunk?\n\nThat being said, some people may find meditation absolutely boring. And I get that. I\u2019ve been there. Done that. For others, it may not be their cup of tea for varying reasons. I also get that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be quite honest, I\u2019m skeptical myself as to how long I\u2019ll be able to keep it up, even with my trusty app to help guide my thoughts to some semblance of peace and equanimity. But for now, I\u2019m gonna enjoy my extra hours of restful sleep and watch my skin flourish, particularly in my under-eye region, without them bags they were carrying, while I also watch my mood prosper because I\u2019m actually resting.\n\n\n\nDo any of you folks happen to meditate? What are some of the benefits you\u2019ve noticed?

(Note that I am commenting on the videos, not the songs.)\n\n\n\nIn my ongoing attempt to highlight the underappreciated parts of black culture, I present to you the 10 best worst black videos of all time, ranked.\n\n\n\n10. \u201cSomebody\u2019s Watching Me,\u201d by Rockwell\n\nRockwell\u2019s video does its best to give the feel of a 1980s horror film with the continuous first-person shot and the cuts to macabre faces and images \u00e0 la Brian De Palma. It might have worked if he had tried to act; instead, he just relies on the fact that he is light-skinned with curly hair. Two observations: 1) I still can\u2019t believe they got Michael Jackson to sing the chorus, and 2) someone should have told him his boxers were showing in the shower.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. \u201cWe Don\u2019t Have to Take Our Clothes Off,\u201d by Jermaine Stewart\n\nThis is a song about how lovers don\u2019t have to take their clothes off while a woman in the foreground consistently takes her clothes off as she is splashed with water, accosted by wind that makes her dress fly up, and wears a graduation mortarboard and tassel. The late, great singer is exuberant and full of life in the video, but the campiness of the direction is too much to overcome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. \u201cYou Are Not Alone,\u201d by Michael Jackson\n\nThe King of Pop was a music-video auteur. \u201cThriller,\u201d \u201cBad,\u201d \u201cBeat It\u201d: They are classics. This video featuring Lisa Marie Presley is one of his few missteps because in it, he tries desperately to be sexy and fails miserably. Related: How long are we going to delay having a conversation about Michael\u2019s kids? Old Mike may have been light bright, but young Mike\u2019s genes are still of the brown-skin, dark, curly-hair variety. Too soon?

The robbery/murder is poorly planned and executed, and Sweat has one reaction to everything that happens: bored, sleepy and high. Song is fire, though.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. \u201cKeep on Loving Me,\u201d by the Whispers\n\nA ubiquitous GIF comes from your misogynistic uncle\u2019s favorite video. I\u2019ll leave the hair, mustaches and suits alone because they are a product of their time (I bet you can find an Easter Sunday picture of your grandfather or father wearing those exact-same threads). Yet I am confused by this video. The five men following a woman thing is creepy; what would they have done if they caught her? And, finally, where the hell are they going?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: The views of Law Ware do not necessarily reflect the views of VSB or, at least Panama Jackson, who thinks this video\u2014and song, for that matter\u2014is one of the best he\u2019s ever seen in his entire life and hopes to re-create it at some point and will be the one wearing the red sports jacket. \u2014P.J.]\n\n\n\n5. \u201cWord Up,\u201d by Cameo\n\nCameo must have been trying to make a bad video. Everything from the police opening to the band-member intros to the fact that he stands in front of a New York City bridge while wearing a leather jacket, a body suit and a red jockstrap cup screams intentionality. I have always wondered if that was, in fact, LeVar Burton dancing at the beginning of the video. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not, but a man can dream.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cMust Be the Money,\u201d by Deion Sanders\n\nThis begins with a flashback of him wearing a fake Jheri-curl wig as he rhymes the words nine and dotted line. Then it transitions into a four-minute montage of Primetime looking into the mirror admiring himself as women fawn over him. We could call this the first reality show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \u201cPut Your Mouth on Me,\u201d by Eddie Murphy\n\nI cannot overstate how big Eddie Murphy was in the \u201980s. After 48 Hours, Beverly Hills Cop and Raw, he was so powerful that dude released a trash song and it went to No. 2 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The song that was the inspiration for this video, however, was off the second, less successful album, So Happy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, the song is about what you think, and Murphy spends the entire song either lying on a couch looking like a knockoff Prince Hakim or standing on a stage giving googly eyes to the camera, channeling Prince. This is a poor man\u2019s Michael Jackson video.\n\n2. \u201cThe Rain,\u201d by Oran Juice Jones\n\nThis is most known for the words \u201cYou gotta get on outta here with that\n\nalley-cat-coat-wearin\u2019 hush-puppy-shoe-wearin\u2019 crumb cake I saw you with \u2026 ,\u201d but the video is just as absurd as those lyrics. In fact, this could be a toxic-black-masculinity tutorial. He stalks her and uses money to assert power, all while wearing flawless makeup and never standing in the rain despite singing about precipitation and wearing a raincoat. This would be No. 1 if not for the red gloves in \u2026\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. \u201cDon\u2019t Look Any Further,\u201d by Dennis Edwards\n\nThe red-gloved hands that seem to be disembodied, the backdrop, the gum he chews throughout, the wink, the faces he makes. This is the best worst video in every possible way. The song bumps, but the video is so bad in so many amazing ways that it deserves to be on repeat at the National Museum of African American History and Culture. I wonder if the great Timothy Anne Burnside can hook that up.

Even when he is not being honest and it can be proved (as in this case) that what he says and what really happened don\u2019t match, they believe it. This creates a dangerous situation in which his message can become their message.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAttacks on the media are an attempt on Trump\u2019s part to silence the media.

The celebrity DJ-model-producer (and much more) shifted the paradigm in our favor in 2006 when she founded Black Girls Rock!, the award show and nonprofit organization that has since earned worldwide acclaim.\n\nFittingly, Bond literally holds the trademark to \u201cBlack Girl Magic\u201d\u2014a phrase she recently discovered may have originated in friend and author Joan Morgan\u2019s \u201990s hip-hop feminist tome When Chickenheads Come Home to Roost. Bond loves that the expression has become a recent addition to our common lexicon about black womanhood, as she has made it her mission to help as many girls find their magic as possible.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to know everything, but you might know somebody that knows something else, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been able to do [with] Black Girls Rock!\u2014I\u2019ve been able to tap into our village to help me bring this to life and do this work.\n\nNow eBay is recognizing and supporting Bond\u2019s efforts by partnering with Black Girls Rock! for an epic inaugural auction to raise funds for the organization in honor of Black History Month. Launched on Feb. 5, the auction features such gems as a pair of worn and signed ballet shoes from Misty Copeland, coveted red-carpet access to the next Black Girls Rock! award show and signed copies of Bond\u2019s upcoming Black Girls Rock! book, which debuts on Feb. 27 and is already the No. 1 book in preorders on Amazon.com\u2014as well as the first prize to sell out on the eBay auction. As Bond tells The Glow Up:\n\nYou know, I\u2019m just really grateful\u2014it\u2019s exciting to see that people are receiving it so well. But also, it speaks to the importance of the message continuing\u2014the need for the message ... In 2006, when I started Black Girls Rock!, there wasn\u2019t this celebration, acknowledgment [or] inclusion of black women\u2019s narratives, stories, beauty, diversity, nuances\u2014it just wasn\u2019t there in media\u2014in fact, it was completely the opposite, if anything. And so to see where the world has come to now, in this time, and to see all this \u201cBlack Girl Magic\u201d surfacing\u2014or people discovering [it]\u2014it\u2019s just an incredible thing, to know that Black Girls Rock! was very much at the forefront of this movement. It means a lot, but I don\u2019t get fooled by trends ... I feel that the work needs to continue there, and I know that we have to continue to push our message, our narrative, and keep our presence in the forefront. We matter and our voices matter, and our accomplishments matter, our contributions matter, our achievements matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupporting the accomplishments and achievements of future generations is at the heart of Black Girls Rock!, and 100 percent of proceeds from the auction will go back into the organization\u2019s programs, like the Black Girls Lead conference and camps, which have yielded proven results through mentorship, as Bond tells us:\n\nWe are really giving girls tools that they need to empower themselves to take their best to their \u201cbestest\u201d; to go to their next level. And so it\u2019s been really successful. We have a lot of incredible girls that have gone through our programs that stay connected with us, that are now in college. Some of them are graduating [and] going into the business world now. So you know, just to see this work over this time, and to see girls that we\u2019ve literally been surrogate mothers to, in a sense, grow into these incredible young women, it\u2019s been amazing to see.\n\nTo understand the potential impact of a juggernaut like eBay joining forces with Black Girls Rock!, to date, eBay for Charity has raised nearly $810 million for participating charities, raising $84 million in 2017 alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe auction is live until Feb. 15, and the following items and experiences are still up for grabs:\n\nBallet shoes worn and signed by Misty Copeland.\n\n\n\nVIP Experience at the 2018 Black Girls Rock!

One says \u201cBlack Girls Rock!\u201d and the other says \u201cWESLAY.\u201d Each pin is available for $15, or you can purchase the pair for $25. You can also add an additional donation to your purchase during checkout. Remember\u2014100 percent of proceeds benefit Black Girls Rock!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBond hopes that this auction will be the first of many as she continues to grow Black Girls Rock! and ensure that #BlackGirlMagic remains more than a catchphrase, hashtag or trend. She\u2019s constantly strategizing new ways to do the work of elevating us\u2014and hopes that more will do the same:\n\nIt\u2019s easier to do the work than we think it is. And I think that sometimes people get so caught up in the idea [that] it takes so much to start a charity or start a mentoring program. And it really just takes whatever knowledge and skill that you have, using that to empower the next person. You don\u2019t have to know everything, but you might know somebody that knows something else, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been able to do in this time of building Black Girls Rock!\u2014both the award show and the nonprofit. I\u2019ve been able to kind of tap into the community and tap into our village to help me bring this to life and help me do this work. And I think that eBay has joined our village, and I think that\u2019s the beautiful part about this partnership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: The Black Girls Rock! auction is live now through Feb. 15; Pintrill pins are available throughout the month of February.

Hill\u2019s story has been a symbol of cultural reevaluation lately, as her famed egregiously-run 1991 Senate Judiciary hearings beg for atonement now more than ever. (Her sexual harassment claims against then-Supreme Court Justice nominee Clarence Thomas\u2013which were unwittingly leaked to the press\u2013resulted in humiliating interrogation involving porn, breast and penis size, by 14 white men questioning whether she had a \u201czealoting civil rights\u201d agenda in blocking Thomas\u2019s appointment). As head of the Commission on Sexual Harassment and Advancing Equality in the Workplace, Hill be leading a \u201ccomprehensive strategy\u201d to address workplace harassment in the entertainment industry.\n\n\n\nAccording to Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy, who spearheaded the initiative:\n\nThe Commission will not seek just one solution, but a comprehensive strategy to address the complex and inter-related causes of the problems of parity and power. The fact that so many industry leaders\u2014across film, television, music, digital, unions, agencies, ATA, AMPAS, television academy and guilds\u2014came together, in one room, to explore solutions speaks to a new era.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe commission was announced after a meeting held by Kennedy, Nike Foundation founder and co-chair Maria Eitel, Hollywood attorney Nina Shaw, and venture captialist Freada Kapor Klein.\n\nThe meeting was attended by leaders of organizations such as the Academy Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, Disney, Netflix, Warner Bros, Amazon, and CBS, who\u2019ve had to make very public, very big decisions lately thanks to names like Weinstein, Spacey, Ratner, Price, Tambor, and Rose, to name a few. (The full list includes representatives from Atlantic Records, the Recording Academy NARAS, Sony, the Producers Guild of America, Universal Music Group, the Directors Guild of America, Motion Picture & TV Production/IATSE 4th international, the Television Academy, Paramount, Universal Filmed Entertainment Group, UTA, ICM Partners, the Writers Guild of America, the CAA, Alliance Motion Picture and Television Producers, and William Morris Endeavor.)\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly how the commission will work, but Hill states that they \u201cwill be focusing on issues ranging from power disparity, equity and fairness, safety, sexual harassment guidelines, education and training, reporting and enforcement, ongoing research, and data collection.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Kathleen Kennedy floated the idea in October, she spoke about the need for \u201czero tolerance policies\u201d for sexual harassment and assault and a system where victims can report claims without fear of professional retribution. Kennedy proposed that the commission be funded by the industry and comprised of HR professionals, lawyers, sociologists, psychologists, and feminist activists and theorists, and general entertainment industry people, according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nIt sounds like we will not be getting a draconian penis-obsessed tribunal, because it\u2019s not the senate, but instead something more like a more permanent industry-wide platform for dealing with assault and harassment to replace the current system of case-by-case company bases. \u201cIt is time to end the culture of silence,\u201d Hill said in her statement. \u201cI\u2019ve been at this work for 26 years.

Years before her success as a television host, she dominated New York City radio as a shock jock obsessed with celebrity gossip and provocative chitchat.\n\nShe spat vitriol that scathed her targets and caused many of them to retaliate, most notably Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs back in 1998, after she spread rumors that he was gay. The hip-hop mogul flexed his influence so hard, Williams was blackballed in her industry, bringing her career to a full stop for a number of years. But it was as clear then as it is today that she gives zero fucks about what rolls off her tongue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of this #MeToo movement,\u201d she said during her show\u2019s \u201cHot Topics\u201d segment. \u201cI love that people are speaking up for the first time and coming out and everything, but now it\u2019s got\u2014I look at all men like, \u2018You\u2019re a #MeToo.\u2019 All of them. All of them, which is not fair.\u201d\n\nAnd in response to the recent #MuteRKelly campaign, Williams had this to say: \u201cWhat is this, 10 years too late? It\u2019s not going to work. Black people aren\u2019t really good at protesting. Not since the King march ... R. Kelly wasn\u2019t a \u2018me too.\u2019 Aaliyah voluntarily married him when she was 15 years old. Her parents voluntarily let her do it.\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019 recent comments in response to the #MeToo and #MuteRKelly campaigns are, in my opinion, her most vile and disgusting to date. Not only did she de-emphasize the activists\u2019 initiative to aggressively protest at R. Kelly performances (at whatever point in time), but she argued on the crooner\u2019s behalf. Williams basically absolved Kelly, co-signed his statutory conduct and lambasted the young women who were linked to him.\n\n\n\nHer level of victim-blaming is both disturbing and reckless. Williams chided late songstress Aaliyah\u2014and, inaccurately, her parents\u2014for consenting to marriage with the R&B pervert. She also claimed that the teen girls who are currently part of Kelly\u2019s harem are willing participants\u2014and faulted their parents for that, too. And perhaps worst of all, the host also told her viewers that the 13-year-old girl allegedly featured in Kelly\u2019s sex tape\u2014whom he purportedly urinated on\u2014\u201cwas down with it.\u201d All because Williams is \u201csick of the #MeToo movement.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrankly, I am sick of Wendy Williams.\n\nWilliams\u2019 statements and defense of R. Kelly are a slap in the face to female survivors of sexual abuse, vulnerable girls and the movements that advocate for them. She is one of many black women whose thinking is so patriarchal, they engage in a brand of misogynoir that is not only foul AF, but downright dangerous.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s internalized racism and internalized misogyny,\u201d Stacey Patton told The Glow Up. Patton is assistant professor of multimedia journalism at Morgan State University and the author of Spare the Kids: Why Whupping Children Won\u2019t Save Black America. She said:\n\nThere\u2019s a long tradition of this, deeply tied to the history of slavery and racism. One of the core features of the racialization of black bodies is to create this narrative that they\u2019re sexual deviants. Black [women] have participated in that discourse, softly believing that if they adhere to rules about what it means to be a virtuous woman, that somehow it makes us more acceptable to society. So we can\u2019t, even in our imagination, believe young black girls can be victimized in this way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams\u2019 narrative reeks of toxic femininity. In many black communities and households alike, young girls are emotionally victimized\u2014largely by women, long before they encounter men. They are unfairly sexualized according to their attitudes, bodies and mannerisms. Some of us may be familiar with the term \u201cacting womanish\u201d being directed at black girls. For those who are not, Dorothy Randall Tsuruta made it plain in her article for the Western Journal of Black Studies, where she explained:\n\n[The] culturally-derived concept, womanish (\u201cmannish\u201d for boys) is rooted in the social practice of Black adults, especially Black women, setting boundaries for Black girls.\n\nThough writer Alice Walker is sympathetic in redefining the expression to embolden young girls with womanish characteristics, many women remain stuck on its original connotations. They wax old toxic philosophies onto innocent girls\u2014much as Williams does, when she faults underage girls for their engagement with Kelly\u2014knowing full well that the law and power dynamics involved clearly define them as prey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t divorce that shaming of young black girls from the [parent] shaming we see online,\u201d Patton said, speaking of the extremes some women will go to to guilt their daughters.\n\nNothing good comes from this toxic policing of our girls. It upholds the patriarchal idea that black girls are fast-ass Jezebels who are sexually mature beyond their years and need to be subdued. It denies them the opportunity to be exactly who they are\u2014young girls. This castigation chips away their confidence, diminishes their self-esteem and stunts their agency. It robs them of the tools needed to protect themselves from being exploited\u2014sexually or otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams\u2019 dismissal of black women\u2019s agency is akin to silencing them. In a broader context, it contributes to the erasure of black women\u2014as if patriarchy, white feminism and the world at-large don\u2019t already have that task covered.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this before\u2014when the FBI, white liberals and activist groups tried to suppress the female voices of #BlackLivesMatter by co-opting their agenda. More recently, we saw it when ESPN suspended Jemele Hill for \u201ca second violation of social media guidelines\u201d\u2014also known as expressing her views as a black woman about a \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d president. The attempt to quiet black women is overwhelming, and where we don\u2019t need it is in spaces or conversations among our own.\n\nThe #MuteRKelly campaign is long overdue. For over 20 years, Kelly has reportedly engaged in felonious sex with underage women and allegedly continues to do so with impunity. This is mainly because the black community has not held Kelly or other sexual miscreants like him accountable. The fact that the #MuteRKelly campaign\u2019s creators, Kenyette Barnes and Oronike Odeleye, have come through to do the extreme lifting that no one else bothered to do speaks volumes to their commitment to black woman and girls. That Williams denigrates their efforts by stating, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work,\u201d further confirms that she does not value the voices of black women or their resistance.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOdeleye considers the slight a plus, telling The Glow Up:\n\nBy bringing up the #MuteRKelly discussion on the national stage, Wendy Williams helped spread the message that there are black women nationwide standing united to end the sexual, physical and mental abuse of our young black women. . .Wherever R. Kelly is performing, we\u2019ll be there. We won\u2019t rest until we have, at the very least, ended his career. We are working with the victims, victims\u2019 families and attorneys to bring yet another criminal case against him. We plan to be a needle in his side until he\u2019s in the poor house, a mental facility or a jail cell.\n\nTarana Burke, founder of the Me Too movement, also feels that Kelly\u2019s time is up and that he should not be \u201cconveniently\u201d left out of conversations on sexual assault, especially among black women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlack women are just as vocal about giving R. Kelly a chance. I\u2019ve seen Facebook statuses that say, \u2018I don\u2019t care who [R. Kelly] is fucking, I\u2019m going to see him tonight\u2014I\u2019m buying my ticket,\u2019\u201d Burke stated in a phone interview with The Glow Up.\n\nThe Me Too movement founded by Burke in 2006 is not be confused with the latest #MeToo movement tied to the sexual harassment and rape of women in Hollywood. Although the two intersect today, initially they did not. Burke\u2019s movement was specifically started for underserved black girls from low-income communities who were sexually victimized and in need of supportive healing.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Burke responded to Williams\u2019 inflammatory comments:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSexual violence knows no race, color, class or gender, but the response to sexual violence does,\u201d Burke said in our interview. \u201cThe response to sexual violence is highly gendered and highly racialized and definitely defined by class.\u201d\n\nYeah, that part.\n\nIt is this nuance that allows R. Kelly to get off scot-free. Williams is reckless and clearly driven by her black female antagonism in not making these distinctions. That Williams (and black women of the same ilk) can afford to be so \u201csick of\u201d #MeToo is really quite disconcerting. In the same vein as Kelly, she is both a trigger and the gun, busting shots at black women, exploiting them and denying their humanity. Like R. Kelly, Wendy is out here wildin\u2019, and she, too, needs to be put on mute.", "keywords": ["wildin", "black", "girls", "kelly", "assault", "muterkelly", "r", "williams", "wendy", "metoo", "young", "women", "comes", "twisted", "sexual"], "polarity": 0.01676189520560382, "subjectivity": 0.48182343778370257},

Tam ruled in favor of Simon Tam and his Asian-American rock band the Slants, giving them the go-ahead to trademark their band\u2019s name. As Ars Technica notes, the ruling is also relevant to the high-profile case involving the NFL\u2019s Washington Redskins, who were in danger of losing their highly offensive trademark but are now likely to be able to retain it under the decision.\n\nThe court ruled that the law stating a trademark cannot \u201cdisparage or falsely suggest a connection with persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or bring them into contempt, or disrepute,\u201d violates the First Amendment.\n\nWhen Tam was unable to register his trademark years ago, he took his case to federal court. In 2015 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in his favor and found the so-called disparagement clause to be unconstitutional.\n\nThe appeals court ruling led the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to appeal to the Supreme Court with the argument that trademarks are government speech, not private speech, and trademarks should be considered either a form of government subsidy or a government program, but not a citizen\u2019s \u201cfree speech.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe court ruled that calling trademarks government speech is far-fetched. Justice Samuel Alito, in writing for the majority, acknowledged that the anti-disparagement clause seeks to accommodate everyone (\u201cIt applies equally to marks that damn Democrats and Republicans, capitalists and socialists, and those arrayed on both sides of every possible issue\u201d), but in the sense relevant to this case, it is \u201cviewpoint discrimination. Giving offense is a viewpoint.\u201d\n\nAlito also highlighted the law\u2019s overly broad reach: \u201cIt applies to trademarks like the following: \u2018Down with racists,\u2019 \u2018Down with sexists,\u2019 \u2018Down with homophobes,\u2019\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is not an anti-discrimination clause; it is a happy-talk clause.\u201d\n\nAlito continued: \u201cThe proudest boast of our free speech jurisprudence is that we protect the freedom to express \u2018the thought that we hate.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom Ars Technica:\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy wrote a separate, concurring opinion that was also signed by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. Those four justices agreed with the overall conclusion of the court but don\u2019t sign on to some parts of the analysis, arguing instead that the constitutional ban on \u201cviewpoint discrimination\u201d renders some of the majority\u2019s analysis unnecessary. They further argue that whether or not trademarks are commercial speech\u2014an issue not resolved by this opinion\u2014the issue deserves the \u201cheightened scrutiny\u201d required when analyzing government regulation of speech.\n\nMonday\u2019s ruling likely means that the Redskins will not be stripped of their name and trademark. The ongoing controversy surrounding the team\u2019s unwillingness to change their name even after they have been told how offensive it is to many indigenous people will continue, but there may no longer be legal recourse to force a name change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRon Abramson, an intellectual property attorney with the Lewis Baach law firm, told Ars Technica in an email: \u201cThere will surely be a rash of fringe (and truly offensive) trademark filings as a result of this decision. However, none of them will likely ever be major brands, thus the issue should not have great practical significance.\u201d\n\nRead more at Ars Technica.", "keywords": ["supreme", "washington", "ruled", "technica", "speech", "ars", "means", "court", "offensive", "likely", "trademark", "clause", "trademarks", "issue", "redskins", "ruling"], "polarity": 0.07259803921568629, "subjectivity": 0.551217320261438},

I casually mentioned that I had never seen the film.\n\nThat was a mistake.\n\nI haven\u2019t been able to live since.\n\nApparently, I had committed some crime in the first degree against the black community; my black card was immediately threatened, never mind that I had a good handle on the music (because I\u2019m not an absolute heathen).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI tried to buffer my sins with the fact that I was raised in the West Indies. The fact that I didn\u2019t really have a TV growing up because Hurricane Louis knocked out our cable in 1995 and my traitorous family never bothered to have it reinstalled. The fact that the film came out six years before I was even born. But Yesha was merciless because that is, in fact, just her middle name.\n\nWe could be talking about anything. The fact that I hadn\u2019t seen Purple Rain automatically negated me from the conversation.\n\nFor example, this conversation from back in July:\n\n\n\nYesha: I\u2019ve never had a 40.\n\n\n\nMe: Neither have I.\n\n\n\nYesha: You haven\u2019t seen Purple Rain \u2026 so that\u2019s not saying much.\n\n\n\nIt got to a point where I think I was kind of not seeing it out of spite.\n\n\n\nBut Wednesday\u2014Wednesday\u2014I finally caved. Not because I actually cared to see the film, but because I wanted to see what the hype was about, to see what exactly Yesha had been holding over my head for the past year.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo I shelled out $4 to Amazon Video, grabbed my favorite white-cheddar popcorn and settled in.\n\n\n\nAnd thus, there went two hours of my life\u2014on a day off, as a matter of fact\u2014that I would never be able to get back.\n\n\n\nAbout 20 minutes in, I messaged Yesha:\n\n\n\nMe: This movie is terrible and weird as shit.\n\n\n\nYesha: OMG. SHUT UP.\n\n\n\nBut I said what I said. I think those who are honest with themselves can objectively say that Purple Rain is a terrible movie. The acting is just a whole new level of bad, with no actual good actors to even attempt to carry the movie on their impressive acting chops. The plot was patchy at best.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat being said, all 200 of the concert scenes? Absolutely amazing. Prince may have been a terrible actor, but a performer he still was, and seeing him onstage, even TV stage, will never not be a treat.\n\nLet me find out that Purple Rain was the first visual album.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when it hit me. Halfway through cringing through the acting, and singing along with the songs, I just stopped thinking of this joint as a movie and enjoyed it a million times more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the time Prince got around to singing the titular song, I may have been cheesing like an idiot and drumming on my laptop.\n\nWhat a journey.\n\nIt was a conflicting one.\n\nPrince\u2019s musicianship and artistry will never be up for question. All musical parts of this experience were 10/10. Everything in between, though ... eh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAm I glad I watched Purple Rain? I could honestly have continued just listening to the album and thrived just the same. But hey, at least I\u2019ve taken away Yesha\u2019s trump card, which is never a bad thing.\n\nWell, at least until she figures out what else I haven\u2019t seen. But I\u2019ve learned my lesson.

Essentially, there\u2019s an overwhelming sense of dread that, based on impending demographic trends, has old white people especially worried about their place in the food chain.\n\nWhite people are afraid of becoming a minority and, thus, afraid of all the negative connotations that come with the minority status they\u2019ve placed on others. They\u2019re afraid that when they lose their numerical advantage to the \u201cothers,\u201d we\u2019re going to mete upon them what\u2019s been foisted upon us.\n\nAnd you know what? They\u2019re totally right to worry.\n\nWe\u2019re definitely coming for them. Black people have been planning the revolution for years (hint: It won\u2019t be televised).\n\nOh, yes, it\u2019s the statues first, and after we\u2019ve yanked all those metal mothafuckin\u2019 monuments down, we\u2019re coming to finish the job on white people in total.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose two New Black Panthers outside the Philadelphia polling station in 2012? That was the advance team. Your grandparents tried to warn you, but you didn\u2019t listen.\n\nTo put it simply, as soon as we find out that white people are no longer a majority (we have a Google alert set), we\u2019re kicking off the revolution. It\u2019s coming. Fox News has been right this whole time. That said, this article is strictly based on discussions being held within the black delegation. We haven\u2019t finalized any plans\u2014nor have we been in consultation with our friends from the Latinx, Asian or Native American organizations\u2014but we\u2019re pretty sure we\u2019re all working on some level of demographic-based revenge.\n\nIf you\u2019re white and you\u2019re reading this, this is your warning.

If we\u2019re gonna get really real, we could probably draw a direct line between racists being empowered to publicly vent racist shit in comments sections and the ascension of an openly racist president. There\u2019s something to be said about the anonymity of the internet and the anonymity of the voting booth that emboldens people to dispense with their pleasant facades and embrace the hate within.\n\nNah, fuck all that.

In fact, when I was a kid, nobody liked to eat Aunt Evangeline\u2019s greens because she put too much kale in that shit.\n\nThen white people discovered kale, and it went from being a garnish to some shit I gotta pretend to like enough to spend $68 on it in a salad.

For a black person, looking at Steve Doocy\u2019s shit-eating grin for more than six minutes will generate a level of Afro-ire that can cause one to contemplate whether reverse racism is, in fact, a thing because the anger is so irrational.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s why the revolution needs Keith David as our collective mouthpiece.

This person may not be the most vocal or the most celebrated, and behind the scenes, and sometimes in front of the scenes, they are often ridiculed, admonished and shunned until history reverses course to prop them up as heroes.\n\n\n\nIn this historical time of the #MeToo movement, and the downfall of men who didn\u2019t learn in kindergarten to keep their hands to themselves, Anita Hill\u2019s legacy is starting to change course. In 1991, Hill claimed that then-Judge Clarence Thomas, who was being vetted for the Supreme Court, had sexually harassed her during the two years that she worked for him.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee, which was chaired by Democrat Joe Biden, never seemed to take Hill\u2019s claim seriously. She offered to take a polygraph test to prove that Thomas had made sexual suggestions and inappropriate comments to her during her time working for him, but the committee wasn\u2019t interested. There were also reportedly four women who were willing to testify on Hill\u2019s behalf that Thomas behavior had, in fact, been inappropriate. For days, Hill sat before a panel of white men who berated her for speaking out against sexual assault.\n\nBiden did little to stop the attacks and the harsh line of questioning and insults that Republicans unleashed in an attempt to discredit Hill. It almost felt as if, during that time, Biden didn\u2019t believe Hill, either, so he allowed her to be dehumanized for telling her truth.\n\nBut history has a way of remembering the past. Today there is a movie about Hill\u2019s courage and strength, starring Kerry Washington, and now Biden, some 25-odd years later, believes that he owes Hill an apology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI wish I had been able to do more for Anita Hill. I owe her an apology,\u201d Biden said in a recent interview with Teen Vogue. \u201cMy one regret is that I wasn\u2019t able to tone down the attacks on her by some of my Republican friends. I mean, they really went after her. As much as I tried to intervene, I did not have the power to gavel them out of order. I tried to be like a judge and only allow a question that would be relevant to ask.\u201d\n\nBiden has been on a \u201cMan, I Sure Am Sorry About the Way I Allowed My White Brethren to Berate a Woman Who Was Most Likely Sexually Harassed\u201d apology tour. In November during Glamour\u2019s Women of the Year Summit in New York City, Rachel Miller, an editor for BuzzFeed, asked Biden\u2014who, it should be noted, voted against Thomas\u2019 confirmation to the Supreme Court\u2014a question, HuffPost reports: \u201cIn the context of changing the culture and women being brave enough to come forward, I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s anything that you would do differently with regards to Anita Hill, if given the opportunity?\u201d\n\nBiden answered: \u201cWhat I do feel badly about is the bad taste that got left in the mouth of some of the people around Anita Hill, and maybe even Anita, about whether or not the witnesses should have been called who were called and weren\u2019t called, etc,\u201d Biden said. He also said, again, that he owed her an apology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen. Fucking. Apologize. To. Her. And. Stop. Talking. About. It.\n\nThis is why I don\u2019t believe that Biden\u2019s apology tour is genuine, because it never had to be an apology tour. Biden is the former vice president of the United States. If he really wanted to apologize to Hill, he could find her and do just that. It\u2019s like people who post comments to their Facebook pages that they are praying for the victims of natural disasters: It isn\u2019t because they actually give a shit about the people suffering from natural disasters, but they do give a shit that you know that they are praying for the victims of natural disasters. Just get off Facebook and pray already, but stop advertising that you\u2019re praying.\n\nWhich makes me think that if Biden is worried about his public persona in the era of #MeToo, then he\u2019s probably pushing for a presidential run, but other than being a sideshow in the highly addictive \u201cSTFU Joe\u201d memes (see below) featuring him and former President Barack Obama, I don\u2019t know what Biden has done to make himself attractive to voters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt this point, looking like the opposite of President Grab \u2019Em by the Pussy is letting everyone know that he, too, believes that he should apologize to Hill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is a public put-on during a very sensitive time, and Biden is playing into that. Joe, if you believe that you owe Hill an apology, then give her one and let\u2019s move on, because acting as if this is haunting your sensibilities is starting to make you look like the guy who\u2019s really sensitive to the woman who\u2019s crying but who secretly has sinister motives.

This was the concern shared by Voices in Entertainment, a grassroots group initiated by female music execs concerned that the movement wasn\u2019t effectively reaching the music industry. Their first initiative? An email encouraging Grammy Awards attendees to wear white roses, in what would hopefully become the music industry\u2019s version of the #TimesUp blackout on the Golden Globes red carpet.\n\nBut while there were many white roses and #TimesUp pins among the designer finery on the Grammys red carpet, the most powerful moment of the night would be onstage. During her introduction of what would be an emotional performance by Kesha, musician and actress Janelle Mon\u00e1e gave a compelling speech, reminding the audience assembled at New York City\u2019s Madison Square Garden and abroad:\n\nTonight, I am proud to stand in solidarity as not just an artist, but a young woman, with my fellow sisters in this room who make up the music industry. Artists, writers, assistants, publicists, CEOs, producers, engineers and women from all sectors of the business. We are also daughters, wives, mothers, sisters and human beings. We come in peace, but we mean business. And to those who would dare try to silence us, we offer you two words: Time\u2019s up. We say time\u2019s up for pay inequality, time\u2019s up for discrimination, time\u2019s up for harassment of any kind, and time\u2019s up for the abuse of power. Because you see, it\u2019s not just going on in Hollywood, it\u2019s not just going on in Washington; it\u2019s right here in our industry as well. And just as we have the power to shape culture, we also have the power to undo a culture that does not serve us well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a Grammys moment well worth remembering, and \u201cWe come in peace, but we mean business\u201d are words we won\u2019t be surprised to hear become a common phrase within the #TimesUp moment.\n\nWhile we\u2019re already ready to say it with our chests, in our fast-fashion culture, we\u2019re sure it\u2019ll only be a matter of hours before we can do so. But while we ponder our new catchphrase, let\u2019s not lose the import of Mon\u00e1e\u2019s words.

Schumer (D-N.Y.) said that Democrats would filibuster the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch, and on Monday, they secured enough votes to do just that.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, this makes it all but certain that Republicans will fight back by changing the rules of the chamber to ensure a Gorsuch confirmation later this week.\n\nFive more senators announced Monday that they would vote against Gorsuch, and that provided more than the 41 senators required to block a procedural vote.\n\nAt this point, either President Trump will have to withdraw Gorsuch\u2019s nomination, or Senate Republicans will have to change the rules to eliminate the 60-vote requirement.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called the Democratic opposition \u201ca new low\u201d and said that Gorsuch will be confirmed by Friday despite the likelihood of a filibuster. According to the Post, McConnell is ready to invoke \u201cthe nuclear option,\u201d which is a change in rules that would allow Supreme Court nominees to be confirmed with a simple majority vote, and with 52 seats, Republicans have that simple majority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRetired Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) was the first to invoke the nuclear option in 2013 when he was majority leader and allowed non-Supreme Court presidential appointments to be confirmed with a simple majority.\n\nThe Washington Post predicts that McConnell will be called upon to eliminate the 60-vote requirement in other instances, too, like budget bills or any legislation, and if that happens, bipartisan cooperation would be a thing of the past in the Senate.\n\nFrom the Washington Post:\n\nDemocratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), Patrick J. Leahy (Vt.), Christopher A. Coons (Del.), Mark R. Warner (Va.) and Robert Menendez (N.J.) indicated Monday that they would oppose Gorsuch and vote against cloture\u2014the motion to end a filibuster that is required to hold an up-or-down confirmation vote. During an hourslong committee hearing, Leahy criticized Gorsuch\u2019s answers during his marathon confirmation hearing as \u201cexcruciatingly evasive.\u201d He said that a GOP move to end filibusters of Supreme Court nominees would damage the Senate, but he argued that he had to vote his conscience, even if it pushes Republicans to change the rules. \u201cI cannot vote solely to protect an institution when the rights of hard-working Americans are at risk,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I fear that the Senate I would be defending no longer exists.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFour Democratic senators intend to vote to end the filibuster. Three of those senators\u2014Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.)\u2014are the targets of a $10 million ad campaign by the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, which, according to the Post, is pressuring Democrats facing re-election next year in states won by Trump in November to vote for Gorsuch.\n\nSen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) said Monday that he would join Republicans in trying to end the filibuster, but did not say whether he would vote for Gorsuch. Bennet is the only Democratic senator opposing the filibuster who is not up for re-election in 2018.\n\nOn Sunday\u2019s edition of NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, McConnell said, \u201cI don\u2019t think the legislative filibuster is in danger.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the same program, Schumer said, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any thirst to change the legislative rules. Most Democrats and most Republicans have served in both the minority and the majority and know what it means.\u201d\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["washington", "gorsuch", "secure", "democrats", "change", "vote", "likely", "gop", "rules", "mcconnell", "senate", "republicans", "post", "majority", "filibuster", "votes", "rule"], "polarity": 0.14714035964035962, "subjectivity": 0.4377206127206127},

Now in his 10th year as head of his own label, the most successful graduate of the Project Runway franchise has built his success on dressing women of all colors, shapes and sizes and fully diversifying his runway presentations into inspirational, aspirational and attainable symbols of beauty and style.\n\nThough Siriano himself is as petite as they come, he knows that the fashion struggle is real for people whose proportions, personalities or orientations are not the \u201cnorm\u201d on the retail floor or red carpet. Maybe that\u2019s why he\u2019s been so nimble at dressing die-hard fans like EGOT Whoopi Goldberg, who sat front-row at his show Saturday, along with rap \u201cit\u201d girl Cardi B, dressed head to toe in a money-green suit with a white mink stole tossed over her shoulder for good measure. Both were there to applaud the 10th year of his superluxe ready-to-wear collection.\n\nBut Siriano\u2019s work just isn\u2019t for the rich and famous; we can all walk in designer shoes from the collection he personally designs for Payless, or slide into a sheath from his ongoing collaboration with plus-size retailer Lane Bryant. Siriano does runway regality at real prices just as well as he does high-fashion fantasy, but what was on his runway yesterday was simply one wow moment after another.\n\nBrilliant colors ruled Siriano\u2019s fall-winter collection\u2014crimson reds, fuchsia pinks and Cinderella blue, rippling with ruffles from shoulders to hem, and tiers of tulle that opened up from the back of the dresses like the plumage of a magnificent African bird. Even the suits were lush\u2014made of velvet embedded with tiny crystals, which struck the perfect balance between flashy details and froufrou femininity \u2014something that I\u2019m all for, by the way\u2014especially when those elements are rendered with witty restraint and a sophisticated silhouette.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOrange Is the New Black\u2019s Danielle Brooks walks the runway for Christian Siriano.

With some of the ads calling for protections of gun rights, warning of the so-called dangers of immigration and of promoting Black Lives Matter groups, the Kremlin has shown a shrewd willingness to manipulate race relations in the United States at any cost to the Americans it once claimed to support: black people.\n\n\n\nThe Washington Post recently reported that members of Congress have already discovered that some of the ads have depicted a rise of Black Lives Matter groups in ways aiming to evoke fears among white Americans of an opposing political threat rising. CNN published its own reporting detailing how some of the ads promoted gun rights and the Second Amendment, both topics that resonate with many white Americans who feel their rights are being infringed upon. Conceivably, this tactic, in turn, was supposed to encourage white Americans, with their racist insecurities, to vote for Donald Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile more studies are revealing that false information spread on social media in swing states more often than in nonswing ones, the jury is still out on whether or not \u201cfake news\u201d actually impacted people\u2019s voting at the ballot box.\n\nBut one thing is 100 percent clear: The Russian Federation\u2014a nation that, through its former state of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, long claimed to be an advocate for black liberation\u2014never loved us. This week\u2019s revelations of Facebook ads specifically using Black Lives Matter activists as bait for white aggrievement is a sharp reversal of Russia\u2019s racial manipulation tactics in the United States.\n\nAs early as the 1920s, Soviet leadership realized that they could take on Western imperialism by exploiting its mistreatment of black people\u2014be it under Jim Crow in the United States or colonialism on the continent of Africa. The selling point was that the USSR was better, which it never really was.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe USSR financed tens of thousands of black people to study in various republics throughout the union with the hope that they would return to their homelands to start their own Red Octobers. On the U.S. front, the USSR also recruited black Americans to spread its propaganda.\n\nOne of their prized recruits was the great writer Langston Hughes. He and several dozen other black people were selected to act in a USSR-funded filmed titled Black and White, a cinematic chiding of American Southern racism. Hughes details in his autobiography, I Wonder as I Wander, that the black performers were not trained actors; nor could most of them sing for the parts the roles required. (Hughes determined that Russians assumed all black people could sing, dance, play sports and act, so there was no need to vet them for any real qualifications.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt any rate, the film ended up getting scrapped because the U.S. granted the USSR diplomatic recognition in 1933. One of the conditions, among paying unsettled debts to Washington, D.C., was to end all propaganda against America\u2014which, of course, included Black and White. Rightfully, the young black wannabe actors felt betrayed and considered the Soviets\u2019 attempts to curry favor with the black struggle insincere and downright fraudulent.\n\nThey were correct.\n\nIn Black on Red: My 44 Years Inside the Soviet Union, Robert Robinson wrote about how he was recruited by the USSR to be an engineer in a Moscow plant in 1930. Robinson was looking for engineering work, which he could never find in Detroit, where he worked a dead-end job in a Ford Motor Co. plant. Soviet representatives, who were very likely spies, convinced him that he\u2019d be able to earn an engineering degree in Moscow\u2014which he did\u2014and not face any racism\u2014which, of course, he faced a lot of, including from his own bosses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoviet authorities plastered his face on state-run newspapers with reports of his job promotions throughout the \u201930s, \u201940s and \u201950s. All the while, he was regularly called nigger by his colleagues and passed over for managerial roles at his factory by less-qualified Russians who often took credit for his work. Worst of all, Soviet authorities refused to let him leave the country for fear that he\u2019d reveal how much of a sham the USSR\u2019s claim of solidarity with black people really was. He ended up escaping to Uganda in 1974.\n\nAllison Blakely, professor emeritus of history at Boston University and one of America\u2019s leading authorities on Russia\u2019s relationship with black people, said that the kinds of experiences black people like Robinson lived through were common. While the USSR was proficient in attracting black Americans, it made little real effort to have meaningful relations with them.\n\n\u201cIt really wasn\u2019t so much of the success of what the communists were offering,\u201d Blakely said. \u201cIt was the disappointment of what the United States was doing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, while the USSR proved to be just as discriminatory as America in many respects, it was creating propaganda for its citizens designed to show that black people were treated better in Russia than in the United States. One of the classic examples of this is an old 1960s Soviet cartoon called Mister Twister, which depicted an American imperialist being chided for bringing his racist attitudes with him to the Soviet Union:\n\nAnother propaganda film, from 1936, was Circus, in which a white American circus performer, played by Soviet actress Lyubov Petrovna Orlova, gives birth to a black baby and faces racism in the states. But when she arrives in the USSR, everyone loves her and her black baby. Just like that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s all bullshit, since both Russian and white American men weren\u2019t cool with their women messing with black men. But the film was well-produced at the time and is worth watching to see how hard the USSR worked to convince black people (and their own Soviet citizens) that the Soviet Union had their backs.\n\nAll the while, the KGB was working to undermine America\u2019s sovereignty at the expense of the same black people they claimed to support. Perhaps the most egregious example was the KGB\u2019s attempt to plant fake stories in black newspapers about Martin Luther King Jr. being an \u201cUncle Tom,\u201d according to former KGB Officer Vasily Mitrokhin. The KGB also tried to exploit King\u2019s death by spreading fake news among black nationalists, the Ku Klux Klan and the Jewish Defense League about his murder in order to start a race war, according to Darien Cavanaugh over at War Is Boring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimply put: Evoking racial fears among Americans is an old game for Russia.\n\nWhat is new with today\u2019s Kremlin is that a new opportunity to exploit race in a different way has presented itself. Instead of siding with the oppressed black American population, Russian security services have clearly realized that it is to the Kremlin\u2019s advantage to side with racist white people. Russia\u2019s own rising nationalism, which views immigration from Central Asia as a threat, and Russian politicians\u2019 support of it make for a very convenient relationship with American racists.\n\n\u201cThe Russian leadership sees themselves as the redeemers of whiteness,\u201d said Maxim Matusevich, director of the Russian and East European Studies program at Seton Hall University. \u201cIt is a reversal of the past when the Soviets were standing up for the oppressed and the minorities. Now all of a sudden they\u2019re standing up for whiteness. That\u2019s why I think Putin is so popular with segments of the American right, because they see Russians as the guardians of whiteness: They\u2019re white and they are Christian, they are anti-gay and anti-minority.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more than 70 years, the USSR engaged in a robust propaganda campaign to prove it was the oasis of black liberation. It was all a lie. In its current model of the Russian Federation, the Kremlin has proved that, like its USSR predecessor state, it will use black people as a political tool whenever it suits them.\n\nWe were a tool of the USSR foreign policy then, and we are a tool of Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia now. The Soviets didn\u2019t love us then, and Putin\u2019s Russia certainly proves it doesn\u2019t love us now.", "keywords": ["ussr", "black", "ads", "recent", "white", "facebook", "soviet", "kremlin", "prove", "loved", "russias", "american", "states", "americans", "united", "russian"], "polarity": 0.030344199719199747, "subjectivity": 0.3364225526725525},

Sometimes it hurts more than someone calling me a bitch or cunt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know that as soon as they utter that word, I think about all of the times where I have been pressured, subconsciously or not, implicitly or explicitly, to shrink\u2014or be completely shut off from romantic love for the rest of my life.\n\n\u201cIt makes me feel so large and like there\u2019s no room for anyone else. \u2026 It makes me feel like they\u2019re saying, \u2018Well, there\u2019s no room for me in your life.\u2019 How can I even fit, metaphorically or figuratively, in your life, in this conversation? It\u2019s like a rejection, but it\u2019s also like, \u2018Stay the way you are.\u2019 And it\u2019s like, but if you\u2019re telling me, and so many other people are telling me this, then where does that leave me?\u201d\n\nOn receiving her first vibrator\u2014from her mother:\n\n\u201cWhen I tell you that my body was on fire\u2014I had all of this kinetic energy and my heart just got broken. I didn\u2019t know what happened. I just wanted to be touched and I wasn\u2019t getting it anywhere. There were moments when I was just waking up in the middle of the night just like, it felt crazy. And my mother was kind enough to be like, \u2018I\u2019m going to help you because, what else can I do?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe knew that I was going through it. And it\u2019s a very taboo subject in Christian circles, but it helped me because it helped me to take control of my sexuality. And also it helped me to avoid situations that were not going to be healthy for me.\n\n\u201cNow that I\u2019m an adult, my mother and I have talks about men and everything like that more vividly and more explicitly. It was powerful for me because it let me know that she cared. It let me know that I could talk to her about pretty much anything. When I had my labioplasty, she was there; when my stepfather passed, she was there. There [were] so many moments when she was there.\n\n\u201cI think people have to recognize that black mothers, they aren\u2019t all the same. But in terms of my black mother, she was trying to do stuff [that] when I was younger might seem like, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s trying to make you assimilate to something.\u2019 But she just knows how the world is, and how cruel the world is to black girls.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn being progressive and Christian:\n\n\u201cI think what is important for people of color who identify as Christian to do is to divorce themselves from a white male lens. A lot of times, I\u2019ll meet Christian people and their politics aren\u2019t there. And then I\u2019ll meet people who I\u2019m really great with politically, and they\u2019re agnostic or atheist, and I\u2019m like, well. ... I think the thing for me is it takes deeper investigation on my part to say, \u2018How do I think about Christianity in a liberating sense away from a white male lens?\u2019 And that may be more self-study and less relying on preachers to tell me everything.\u201d\n\nOn how her faith influences her ambition:\n\n\u201cI have to remind myself that if it\u2019s true that what it says\u2014that God knew before I was even born; that he stitched every part of me before I was even conceived of\u2014then why am I going to deny myself? When I think of the professional endeavors ... I think back [to] getting published in the New Yorker at 23 years old. Where did I have the nerve to think [I could do] that?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I used to teach, people, they would say, \u2018Well, how did you know you were ready? Did you say, \u201cOh, I\u2019m going to write 20 articles before I pitch there?\u201d\u2019 And I just said, \u2018I don\u2019t ask for permission in anything that I do in this world, because no one is going to just give it to me. What I can do is come to you with this opportunity that I want. Say, these are the reasons why I can do it.\u2019 And you take from that what you will.\u201d\n\nOn impostor syndrome and the audacity of being on the cover of your own book:\n\n\u201cThere was belief, but don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014when those pieces were, in fact, published, I had very terrible impostor syndrome. I\u2019m talking about looking at my byline, tracing each letter of my name with my eyes and still not believing that I wrote that. ... There were many times with this book ...with the anticipation of it all, [thinking,] \u2018How dare I think that I can write what I just wrote? Where did that type of courage come from?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEven now, when I look at the cover of my book, I think, \u2018How dare I look so proud of my own book? How dare I even be on it?\u2019 But I think what I have to emphasize is that I\u2019ve always been afraid. I\u2019ve always been a worryful person; I just don\u2019t let it overtake the courage.\u201d\n\nOn living in an unapologetically black space:\n\n\u201cI think Harlem is the only place where I\u2019m not so hyperconscious about white people. I know that if I go to the nearest store and I got a scarf on my head, no one\u2019s going to treat me any differently. I will still be acknowledged. ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHarlem is different for me, because it\u2019s the only place where I\u2019m not second-guessing any type of mode of behavior that I have. Despite gentrification, I\u2019m not worried about the white person next to me. I know I\u2019m going to be acknowledged regardless of what I have on my head, what it is that I\u2019m wearing. Nobody\u2019s going to deny me proper treatment.\u201d\n\nOn growing into, and accepting, a desire to be beautiful:\n\n\u201cI think my conception of beauty happened [in] two different ways: One was when I saw Zadie Smith in person, and I was like, she looks exactly as she does in the pictures. A part of me was like, \u2018Oh my God. I\u2019m jealous! She\u2019s stunning!\u2019 And then when I got on the cover of my book, I became much more hyperaware of how I looked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was like, it wasn\u2019t just enough for me to be a great writer, which is what I strive to be all the time. But I wanted people to say that \u2018she\u2019s beautiful\u2019 as well, because that\u2019s the culture we live in. And also because I\u2019ve denied myself acknowledgment of my beauty.\n\n\u201cI feel empowered putting on a bold lipstick. I feel empowered when I try on a new eye shadow in a color that I never thought that I would really like, to be able to indulge in that way, because I never really did that for myself. And if someone acknowledges that attention that I spend on myself, then so be it. It makes me feel good!\n\n\u201cAnd I want to be able to say that with confidence and not think that is, you know, that\u2019s going to be detrimental to my art. Because this is such a personal book, that\u2019s why I\u2019m like\u2014I think that I\u2019m noticing the relationship. It definitely kicked into heavy gear when I was on the cover of my own book.

On Wednesday, the magazine announced that \u201cthe silence breakers\u201d\u2014the victims of sexual harassment and assault who have come forward to tell their stories\u2014had earned the distinction of being its Person of the Year for 2017.\n\nTime Editor-in-Chief Edward Felsenthal told the Today show in an interview Wednesday morning that this year\u2019s #MeToo movement represented the \u201cfastest-moving social change we\u2019ve seen in decades, and it began with individual acts of courage by women and some men too.\u201d\n\nTime\u2019s article features an array of women and men from all backgrounds and walks of life. There are the celebrities who initially grabbed headlines, like actress Ashley Judd, who was the first to go on the record to accuse Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment. But there is also a hospital worker, an engineer, a strawberry picker, a housekeeper, an entrepreneur\u2014all of whom had their portraits taken for the piece.\n\nWhile prominent public figures like Judd and Terry Crews drove the conversation about sexual harassment and sexual assault to the forefront, the article is arguably most effective in showing the scope of a pervasive, global problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Time writes:\n\nThe women and men who have broken their silence span all races, all income classes, all occupations and virtually all corners of the globe. They might labor in California fields, or behind the front desk at New York City\u2019s regal Plaza Hotel, or in the European Parliament. They\u2019re part of a movement that has no formal name. But now they have a voice.\n\nTime magazine says its team spent six weeks compiling stories of harassment and assault, interviewing dozens of men and women in a windowless room in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District. Following Time\u2019s announcement of the Person of the Year, Charlotte Alter, a national correspondent for the outlet, noted on Twitter that the piece was \u201cconceived, reported and written by women.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was fact-checked by women,\u201d Alter added. \u201cThe video was shot and edited by women. The layout and photo spread were designed by women.\u201d\n\nA conspicuous absence on Time magazine\u2019s front cover, though, is that of Tarana Burke, who originally used the phrase \u201cme too\u201d to build solidarity among survivors of sexual abuse more than a decade ago. Burke is featured in both the promotional video for the story and within the article itself.\n\n\u201cSexual harassment does bring shame,\u201d Burke told the magazine. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s really powerful that this transfer is happening, that these women are able not just to share their shame but to put the shame where it belongs: on the perpetrator.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTime does note that people of color\u2014as well as immigrants, people with disabilities, low-income workers and LGBTQ people\u2014face \u201cmany types of dread\u201d when they come forward to report sexual abuse.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf they raised their voices, would they be fired?\u201d the article notes. \u201cWould their communities turn against them? Would they be killed?\u201d\n\nAmong the people of color whose experiences are profiled are Crystal Washington, one of seven employees of the Plaza Hotel who have filed a sexual harassment suit against the hotel; and Adama Iwu, a lobbyist who organized an open letter exposing harassment in the California Legislature. Terry Crews, the most recognizable man to come forward with sexual harassment claims, is also shown prominently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNobody questions the predator,\u201d Crews told Time. \u201cYou know why? Because they just expect it. And I expect it. And I just said, \u2018No more.\u2019\u201d\n\nOf course, not everyone who\u2019s come forward with their stories has been embraced. Anita Hill is rightfully mentioned as a predecessor to the #MeToo movement who did not receive the same groundswell of public support. And among the most conspicuous celebrity absences may be that of actress Lupita Nyong\u2019o, who is among the dozens of women who came forward with stories of Weinstein\u2019s predatory and harassing behavior toward them\u2014and the only one whose story he specifically disputed.\n\nAnd it turns out, Donald Trump, who claimed he would \u201cprobably\u201d have been Time person of the year, did get a mention\u2014as the sexual harasser in chief.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSusan Fowler, a former engineer at Uber, cited the president as a reason she decided to blow the whistle on her former employer.\n\n\u201cI remember feeling powerless and like there was no one looking out for us because we had an admitted harasser in the White House,\u201d Fowler told Time. \u201cI felt like I had to take action.\u201d\n\nRead more at Time.", "keywords": ["magazine", "come", "silence", "breakers", "women", "forward", "men", "movement", "told", "person", "article", "harassment", "names", "sexual"], "polarity": 0.20022434163059163, "subjectivity": 0.4746978715728715},

Musical artists know this\u2014that is why there is an embarrassment of riches when it comes to brown-liquor Christmas songs.\n\nAs I stated before, in order for a track to qualify as a \u201cbrown liquor\u201d song, it must meet certain criteria:\n\nIt must have a pronounced bass line.\n\nThis bass line must be contrasted with an ethereal harmony.\n\nThe sonic tension between these juxtapositions must evoke a mood that is either libidinous or mournful in nature.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet for it to qualify as a brown-liquor Christmas song, it must do Nos. 1 to 3 while also commenting upon or utilizing symbols of the holiday season. This can be done by a) turning a traditional Christmas song into a brown-liquor song (see: the Temptations\u2019 \u201cSilent Night\u201d); b) taking a symbol of Christmas and using it in playful and libidinous ways (see: Clarence Carter\u2019s \u201cBack Door Santa\u201d); or c) using Christmas as a setting to lament the one who got away (see: Luther\u2019s \u201cEvery Year, Every Christmas\u201d).\n\nMany Christmas songs qualify, but below, I present to you the 10 best brown-liquor Christmas songs of all time, ranked.\n\n\n\n10. \u201cMerry Christmas Baby,\u201d by Kenny Burrell\n\nThis is a soulful and jazzy cover of the Johnny Moore\u2019s Three Blazers classic. It\u2019s perfect background music for when you have friends over and you\u2019re mixing up amaretto sours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. \u201cMy Favorite Things,\u201d by John Coltrane\n\nI\u2019m a jazz snob. I don\u2019t do the cheap, elevator-music-adjacent Kenny G bastardization of the black-American art form. If it doesn\u2019t push the boundaries of melody, then you can miss me with your whitewashed, sweet-white-wine shenanigans. \u201cMy Favorite Things\u201d by \u2019Trane is a 13-minute encounter with the divine. It is a masterpiece and perfect with a hot buttered bourbon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. \u201cSanta Claus Wants Some Loving,\u201d by Albert King\n\nEven Santa has needs. This raunchy jawn is your crazy uncle\u2019s second-favorite Christmas song. He drinks Jim Beam out the bottle while he listens to it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. \u201cEvery Year, Every Christmas,\u201d by Luther Vandross\n\nLuther\u2019s voice was one of a kind. \u201cIntimate,\u201d \u201csultry\u201d and \u201cvelvety\u201d don\u2019t do it justice, and his voice is on full display as he sings about how the holiday is a source of pain because his lover is not with him. Sip this with Crown Royal and ginger ale. Be sure you don\u2019t get tears in the glass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. \u201cA Child Is Born,\u201d by Oscar Peterson\n\nThis is a quiet, mournful jazz standard written by composer Alec Wilder and trumpeter Thad Jones. On this cover, Peterson improvises on the melody, filling out the sonic landscape of the song in ways that make it both soulful and melancholic. Watch the snowfall as you listen to this and drink a Swedish glogg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. \u201cPlease Come Home for Christmas,\u201d by Charles Brown\n\nThis is the official Christmas song of juke joints and liquor houses everywhere. Charles Brown\u2019s vocalizations put one in the mood to sip something brown and aged while yearning for the one who got away. Pair this with a Macallan 18-year, straight, no chaser.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cSilent Night,\u201d by the Temptations\n\nThe Temptations\u2019 rendition of this Christmas classic is a soulful blend of the sacred and the secular. Listening to Glenn Leonard makes me do the ugly church face ubiquitous in black houses of worship. This is your spiked-apple-cider song.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \u201cLet It Snow,\u201d by Boyz II Men\n\nChristmas is in winter, and winter is cuffing season. I contend that \u201cLet It Snow\u201d is the definitive sexy Christmas song. \u201cThe market is full of widely recognized artists singing the usual classics,\u201d says Elon Dancy, professor of education and associate dean for community engagement and academic inclusion at the University of Oklahoma. He is a scholar world-renowned for his research into black men in higher education but is also an underappreciated cultural critic. He continues, \u201cHowever, one of the special contributions of Christmas Interpretations is that the majority of the album is original Christmas music \u2026 it is musical velvet.\u201d Keep warm as this plays by sipping a spiked hot chocolate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cBack Door Santa,\u201d by Clarence Carter\n\nOn this track, Carter is petty, trifling and brilliant. That\u2019s why this is your crazy uncle\u2019s favorite Christmas song. He gets fancy, says, \u201cWhat you young bucks know \u2019bout dis right cha,\u201d and drinks Courvoisier out of a snifter as he grooves to this.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. \u201cThis Christmas,\u201d by Donny Hathaway\n\nMuch has been said about this track, so I will just stress to you how strongly I feel that this is the official Christmas song of black folks everywhere. This joint is suitable for every occasion and pairs with any drink. Yet I choose to enjoy it with Johnnie Walker Blue\u2014because I\u2019m bougie.", "keywords": ["track", "best", "christmas", "brownliquor", "season", "know", "santa", "soulful", "songs", "ranked", "song", "sipping"], "polarity": 0.19685639880952382, "subjectivity": 0.5408978174603175},

I do want him to recognize that his mental health might be in a fragile state if negative news could lead to his suicide, and, as such, I want him to leave his post and seek professional help.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo one will think less of him; in fact, many will champion his efforts because mental-health issues are serious and can be dangerous.

Some great moments deserve a sequel, and we\u2019ve therefore done some deep investigative journalism to get the details on our favorite look of Grammy night 2018.\n\nAs previously posted, Eve was our hands-down winner of this year\u2019s awards ceremony, despite not being nominated this year (sorry, Beyonc\u00e9). Thanks to our intrepid, talented and well-connected Gizmodo Media Group family (we\u2019re talking about you, Victor Amos!), we were able to get the scoop on Eve\u2019s incredible Grammys style\u2014and, most important, how to imitate it.\n\nLet\u2019s start with that gorgeous face: Makeup artist Ernesto Casillas has been working with Eve since the promotional tour for Barbershop and counts her among his favorite clients. For her Grammys look, he rose to the occasion while not even knowing what the star would be wearing, as he tells The Glow Up:\n\nFor the look, I knew right away that I wanted to keep it pretty and somewhat classic. We didn\u2019t know exactly what outfit she was going to wear up until right before she went on, so I wanted to keep the colors neutral and paint her in a way that she would feel confident and pretty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe multihyphenate added \u201cred-carpet host\u201d to her title this year, co-hosting the evening\u2019s Grammy Red Carpet Live with Entertainment Tonight\u2019s Nancy O\u2019Dell, Kevin Frazier and Keltie Knight. To make sure the star stayed stellar-looking throughout the day, Casillas had a strategy:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCasillas also wanted to make sure the focus stayed where it belonged while his star was speaking on the red carpet:\n\nEve usually likes to opt for a nude pink lip, but I knew I wanted a midtone lip, since she was wearing a suit and would be interviewing people. I wanted the mouth to also be a focus, but not too dark, either. I lined the lips with a deep berry color and filled in with a lighter, peachier shade. I used Kat Von D\u2019s \u201cLolita\u201d lipstick and some nude gloss over that.\n\nAnd lest we forget that Eve opted to wear not one, but two d\u00e9colletage-baring blazers during the evening, Casillas certainly didn\u2019t, using Gleam Body Bronzing Lotion in shade Deep Gold on her chest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as for that mane of perfectly tousled waves Eve was rocking over her shoulder? You can thank hairstylist Angela Christine, who\u2019s been working with Eve for over seven years and also styles her for The Talk. Christine tells The Glow Up:\n\nShe\u2019s an amazing person to work with, [and] really makes the job easy. Eve loves strong and effortless, so once she chose the suit, she wanted something that felt relaxed and beautiful at the same time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that deciding on Eve\u2019s style was effortless; Christine was ready for a big chop, but the star felt otherwise. \u201cWe actually went back and forth about the hair. ... I wanted to do a shorter, edgy cut, but she was serious about keeping it long,\u201d Christine says.\n\nAnd as for that color? Christine says that she and Eve have been playing with both warm and cool tones lately, and the honey tone was actually done well in advance. The extensions actually came from Christine\u2019s own line, Conscious Curls, in a texture called Strength, which closely resembles natural hair blown out. \u201cThis [allowed] for lots of fullness and volume, which we both loved,\u201d Christine says.\n\nChristine then used a medium-barrel ceramic curling iron to achieve those gorgeous loose waves, strategically curling in opposite directions for a messier look. She then used Ouai Rose Oil and Kenra Texturizing Taffy to create even more separation and texture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristine\u2014who, in addition to working for The Talk, also has a salon in West Hollywood, Calif., and consults for other beauty brands\u2014is releasing a series of affirming children\u2019s books called the Pretty Curls Club.

The party\u2019s stubborn refusal to let go of white, working-class voters who voted for Donald Trump strengthens Biden\u2019s candidacy for some party elites who can\u2019t see that its future rests in the hands of women, young people and minorities\u2014not aging, conservative white men.\n\nBiden\u2019s instant name recognition would pose an immediate threat to other potential front-runners such as Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Terry McAuliffe and Bernie Sanders. But one sticking point that would have the potential to weaken Biden\u2019s candidacy is his unresolved history with Anita Hill. He was the chairman of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991 when Hill brought forth allegations of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas soon after his nomination for the Supreme Court.\n\nHill alleged that while she was working as Thomas\u2019 aide for several years in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Thomas routinely harassed her with sexual comments about his penis and watching porn. During the hearings, Hill repeated the claims to a very hostile committee of male senators who often grilled her more than they did Thomas.\n\nBiden was particularly criticized over the way he handled Hill\u2019s hourslong testimony. Members of the committee asked her intimate details about her sex life. One even suggested that she may have suffered from \u201cerotomania,\u201d a disorder that he suggested led Hill to believe Thomas was in love with her.\n\nBiden was criticized for not stopping these attacks. His refusal to call upon witnesses to support Hill\u2019s claims further angered women\u2019s groups and legal critics. Although he voted against Thomas\u2019 confirmation and has said recently that he always believed Hill, his shortcomings as chairman during those hearings are under an intense microscope again as women are going public with accusations of sexual assault by powerful men in Hollywood, business, media, politics and music. The recent change of climate is forcing everyone to be clear on their stance against workplace sexual harassment. Abusers are just beginning to suffer consequences in a very public manner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor his part, Biden publicly apologized Monday to Hill for how she was treated. That apology likely won\u2019t satisfy many of his critics. If Biden does run in 2020, he, like all Democratic candidates, will have to win over black women, the party\u2019s most important voters, during the primaries to earn the nomination. It\u2019s one thing to express sympathy for the emotional trauma Hill experienced. It is completely another to acknowledge the racial and gender hurdles Hill was forced to navigate during her testimony.\n\nTia Oso, an activist in Los Angeles, said that one of the most striking feelings that Hill\u2019s testimony evoked for her was that, by default, it appeared many of the senators refused to believe a black woman.\n\n\u201cWhite men are over-afforded credibility in our society, and by contrast, women of color\u2014especially black women\u2014always have the burden on us to prove what we\u2019re saying is true\u2014even when we\u2019re fighting for what\u2019s right,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat would she have exactly gained by exposing Clarence Thomas for sexual harassment?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs history has shown, shame and international ridicule. Hill was not heralded as a hero then as she is today. A recent example of Oso\u2019s point came when Lupita Nyong\u2019o wrote in the New York Times that Harvey Weinstein sexually harassed her. While Weinstein generally remained mum about most of his white accusers, he responded directly to Nyong\u2019o\u2019s allegations, in a way that was particularly defensive, as if to say he could not possibly be attracted to a black woman.\n\nThe logic was clear: Who believes black women? Who would believe her?\n\nThat may explain why, for every black woman who reports sexual assault, 15 do not. The Journal of Family Violence also reports that black women suffer greater recovery problems after sexual assault than nonblack victims.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChardonnay Madkins, project manager for the advocacy organization End Rape on Campus, told the Los Angeles Times that, in part, black women are more reluctant than white women to report sexual assault because of patriarchal norms that center the societal struggles of black men over those of black women.\n\n\u201cIt tells these black women to remain silent because the education of their perpetrator is essentially more important than their education, and that [they] can\u2019t be another person who sends a black man to jail,\u201d Madkins told the Times. Women are told, \u201cThese are the few black men who were able to make it to college, and you trying to report them is going to hinder their success.\u201d\n\nThese were the very real pressures Hill faced back in 1991 when she testified against Thomas before the Senate Judiciary Committee, pressures neither Biden nor his colleagues likely considered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Biden does run in 2020, he will have to articulate to black female voters how his insensitive handling of Hill\u2019s testimony impacted black women. Simply saying sorry for what Hill experienced isn\u2019t sufficient, and the issue likely will not quiet down.\n\nBiden needs to own it. And soon. How Biden will address his handling of Hill\u2019s testimony and when depends on a number of factors, says L. Joy Williams, chairwoman of Higher Heights, a national organization dedicated to helping black women win elected office. Conceivably, Williams added, if Biden opts to address his shortcomings during Hill\u2019s testimony now, he would not have to devote too much time to the issue in 2020.\n\n\u201cHe would have to describe the way in which [Hill\u2019s testimony] is perceived, and people know that Anita Hill was treated [badly] during those times, and address his regret for his part in it, while putting that up against his record of also advancing issues of sexual assault,\u201d Williams said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be sure, Biden\u2019s legislative work advocating for the protection of women\u2014especially his landmark Violence Against Women Act\u2014is noteworthy. But one thing doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the other. Hill\u2019s testimony has paved the way for today\u2019s workplace harassment policies.\n\nThere is no telling how significant any of this will be several years from now, but Christina Greer, political scientist at Fordham University, warns that Biden cannot take any chances. The news cycle is primed to explore stories of sexual assault and the men who perpetrate it.

I always knew that it was my personal mission to end these cycles by breaking down these barriers.

The party\u2019s stubborn refusal to let go of white, working-class voters who voted for Donald Trump strengthens Biden\u2019s candidacy for some party elites who can\u2019t see that its future rests in the hands of women, young people and minorities\u2014not aging, conservative white men.\n\nBiden\u2019s instant name recognition would pose an immediate threat to other potential front-runners such as Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Terry McAuliffe and Bernie Sanders. But one sticking point that would have the potential to weaken Biden\u2019s candidacy is his unresolved history with Anita Hill. He was the chairman of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991 when Hill brought forth allegations of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas soon after his nomination for the Supreme Court.\n\nHill alleged that while she was working as Thomas\u2019 aide for several years in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Thomas routinely harassed her with sexual comments about his penis and watching porn. During the hearings, Hill repeated the claims to a very hostile committee of male senators who often grilled her more than they did Thomas.\n\nBiden was particularly criticized over the way he handled Hill\u2019s hourslong testimony. Members of the committee asked her intimate details about her sex life. One even suggested that she may have suffered from \u201cerotomania,\u201d a disorder that he suggested led Hill to believe Thomas was in love with her.\n\nBiden was criticized for not stopping these attacks. His refusal to call upon witnesses to support Hill\u2019s claims further angered women\u2019s groups and legal critics. Although he voted against Thomas\u2019 confirmation and has said recently that he always believed Hill, his shortcomings as chairman during those hearings are under an intense microscope again as women are going public with accusations of sexual assault by powerful men in Hollywood, business, media, politics and music. The recent change of climate is forcing everyone to be clear on their stance against workplace sexual harassment. Abusers are just beginning to suffer consequences in a very public manner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor his part, Biden publicly apologized Monday to Hill for how she was treated. That apology likely won\u2019t satisfy many of his critics. If Biden does run in 2020, he, like all Democratic candidates, will have to win over black women, the party\u2019s most important voters, during the primaries to earn the nomination. It\u2019s one thing to express sympathy for the emotional trauma Hill experienced. It is completely another to acknowledge the racial and gender hurdles Hill was forced to navigate during her testimony.\n\nTia Oso, an activist in Los Angeles, said that one of the most striking feelings that Hill\u2019s testimony evoked for her was that, by default, it appeared many of the senators refused to believe a black woman.\n\n\u201cWhite men are over-afforded credibility in our society, and by contrast, women of color\u2014especially black women\u2014always have the burden on us to prove what we\u2019re saying is true\u2014even when we\u2019re fighting for what\u2019s right,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat would she have exactly gained by exposing Clarence Thomas for sexual harassment?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs history has shown, shame and international ridicule. Hill was not heralded as a hero then as she is today. A recent example of Oso\u2019s point came when Lupita Nyong\u2019o wrote in the New York Times that Harvey Weinstein sexually harassed her. While Weinstein generally remained mum about most of his white accusers, he responded directly to Nyong\u2019o\u2019s allegations, in a way that was particularly defensive, as if to say he could not possibly be attracted to a black woman.\n\nThe logic was clear: Who believes black women? Who would believe her?\n\nThat may explain why, for every black woman who reports sexual assault, 15 do not. The Journal of Family Violence also reports that black women suffer greater recovery problems after sexual assault than nonblack victims.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChardonnay Madkins, project manager for the advocacy organization End Rape on Campus, told the Los Angeles Times that, in part, black women are more reluctant than white women to report sexual assault because of patriarchal norms that center the societal struggles of black men over those of black women.\n\n\u201cIt tells these black women to remain silent because the education of their perpetrator is essentially more important than their education, and that [they] can\u2019t be another person who sends a black man to jail,\u201d Madkins told the Times. Women are told, \u201cThese are the few black men who were able to make it to college, and you trying to report them is going to hinder their success.\u201d\n\nThese were the very real pressures Hill faced back in 1991 when she testified against Thomas before the Senate Judiciary Committee, pressures neither Biden nor his colleagues likely considered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Biden does run in 2020, he will have to articulate to black female voters how his insensitive handling of Hill\u2019s testimony impacted black women. Simply saying sorry for what Hill experienced isn\u2019t sufficient, and the issue likely will not quiet down.\n\nBiden needs to own it. And soon. How Biden will address his handling of Hill\u2019s testimony and when depends on a number of factors, says L. Joy Williams, chairwoman of Higher Heights, a national organization dedicated to helping black women win elected office. Conceivably, Williams added, if Biden opts to address his shortcomings during Hill\u2019s testimony now, he would not have to devote too much time to the issue in 2020.\n\n\u201cHe would have to describe the way in which [Hill\u2019s testimony] is perceived, and people know that Anita Hill was treated [badly] during those times, and address his regret for his part in it, while putting that up against his record of also advancing issues of sexual assault,\u201d Williams said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be sure, Biden\u2019s legislative work advocating for the protection of women\u2014especially his landmark Violence Against Women Act\u2014is noteworthy. But one thing doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the other. Hill\u2019s testimony has paved the way for today\u2019s workplace harassment policies.\n\nThere is no telling how significant any of this will be several years from now, but Christina Greer, political scientist at Fordham University, warns that Biden cannot take any chances. The news cycle is primed to explore stories of sexual assault and the men who perpetrate it. Greer says that if media, especially black news sites, keep Hill\u2019s testimony in the news cycle, it will be very difficult for Biden to avoid.\n\n\u201cIf I were him, I\u2019d face it head on,\u201d she said. \u201cTake your lashes. Lick your wounds and rebuild with black women because he can\u2019t make it without us.\u201d", "keywords": ["black", "biden", "joe", "anita", "hill", "thomas", "needs", "assault", "better", "hills", "offer", "testimony", "men", "apology", "women", "sexual"], "polarity": 0.12769651723041564, "subjectivity": 0.4824309071342966},

The lessons we learn from this\u2014through the lens of an industry that craves publicity but loathes transparency\u2014can and must be applied more broadly throughout American society.\u201d\n\nShe then calls out the entertainment industry itself, which she says \u201cpackages and profits off of female sexuality and limits women\u2019s opportunities to direct and produce content.\u201d\n\nHill continues, also implicating the tech industry, which has seen its fair share of discrimination and egregious sexual harassment claims, and then, unfortunately, all aspects of American society.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe says that since 1991, when she testified during Thomas\u2019 confirmation hearing, she regularly hears from individuals who have tried to stop the abuse but that \u201csecret settlements,\u201d condoned by boards and others, allow the injustice to continue:\n\nSome of those women worked for charities, politicians, religious organizations, businesses and schools that appear to promote equity and fairness. Yet in far too many cases, institutions actively fight substantiated sexual harassment and assault claims, provide cover for abusers and in some cases offer responses that blame the persons raising the claims\u2014often in the name of protecting the institution\u2019s brand. Many have pointed out the fact that secret settlements, which required Weinstein accusers to keep quiet, effectively exposed more women to his lascivious and sometimes criminal behavior over the years. Indeed, Weinstein\u2019s corporate board seemed to fail utterly in its oversight on matters of sexual misconduct. They tolerated and sought to manage the problem, rather than seek to put a stop to it. Companies founded and led by powerful men often effectively put chronic sexual harassment by men in a separate basket, as though it was a \u201cpersonal problem\u201d rather than a serious business one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHill posits that we as a society are in a \u201ccritical moment,\u201d and the way forward is with public and private institutions diversifying leadership, \u201cand finally giv[ing] more real power to those who have experienced inequality firsthand in order to stop devaluing women.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt has been 26 years since a public conversation on sexual harassment began following my testimony,\u201d Hill writes. \u201cDespite a generation growing up hearing that sexual harassment is unacceptable, it clearly remains a plague.\u201d\n\nRead more at the New York Daily News.", "keywords": ["type", "shit", "anita", "scandal", "hill", "institutions", "york", "industry", "day", "writes", "weinstein", "happens", "stop", "womens", "women", "harassment", "sexual"], "polarity": 0.15904744162940884, "subjectivity": 0.5065330161641637},

Some of the stories shared through the #MeToo movement have triggered a range of emotions and questions; some may have come off as \u201cgray areas.\u201d How do we actually know when we\u2019re giving or given consent?\n\nSo glad you asked. Sexual consent is when both parties agree to have sex\u2014throughout the encounter. Let\u2019s start with the basics\u2014we\u2019ll call it \u201cConsent 101\u201d\u2014and then explore some less orthodox situations:\n\n\n\nDo I Really Need to Hear a \u201cYes\u201d?\n\nWell, yeah. You do. Hearing \u201cyes\u201d from your partner is\u2014and should be\u2014sexy as fuck. Speaking personally, nothing turns me on more than a partner who respects my wishes and wants to know my needs. When the chemistry is there, then ask questions like, \u201cIs it OK to touch ___?\u201d or \u201cDo you mind if I ___?\u201d Some people might consider this a mood killer, but guess what? Jail time and being heavily judged by your peers as a rapist are definite libido killers.\n\nIf You\u2019re Not Sure, Question It\u2014and Actually Get a Confirmation\n\nThey didn\u2019t say no, but they didn\u2019t say yes, either. Again: You NEED confirmation from your partner. To assume is making an ass out of you and me; so take away the doubt and question it. And don\u2019t stop there\u2014actually get a solid answer. Most times, body language can tell you a lot, even without words. If your partner is getting tense, ask again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsent Isn\u2019t Only Given by a Woman\n\nAllow me to burst a few bubbles: Consent isn\u2019t something that\u2019s gender-specific. If you think women are exempt from being sexual predators, think again. And if you think men are excluded from being victims, you\u2019re delusional.\n\nHere are some alarming statistics: According to the Connecticut Alliance to End Sexual Assault, 1 in 6 men will be sexually assaulted in their lifetimes\u2014and 1 in 4 of those victims are under the age of 12. These statistics are not mentioned to make women feel that their issues don\u2019t matter, but we need to acknowledge that men can be affected by sexual trauma, too. And we definitely cannot exclude the transgender, genderqueer or nonconforming populace from the conversation\u2014a 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey (pdf) found that 47 percent of transgender people are assaulted in their lifetimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing the Same Sex Doesn\u2019t Give You a Hall Pass\n\nFrom personal experience, I\u2019ve lost count of how many women I\u2019ve had to check for attempting to disrespect my personal space. As a bisexual woman who owns her sexuality, I\u2019ve found that some people fetishize my sexual orientation.\n\nOne night, while barhopping with friends, a plus-one from our outing put her hand on my breasts. Startled, I jumped back and immediately questioned her motives. Despite expressing how her repulsive actions made me feel, she instantly dismissed my feelings, suggesting that I \u201cget over it.\u201d She even pointed to my vagina, to imply that we have the same body parts. It ruined my night, and thankfully, others no longer felt comfortable bringing her to future functions. Violation of anyone\u2019s personal space, same sex or not, is wrong\u2014on a moral and legal level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsent for One Thing Doesn\u2019t Mean Everything Is Covered\n\nJust because I agreed to one sexual act doesn\u2019t mean I consent to do other things. Also, what\u2019s comfortable today may not serve as a kink tomorrow. Frankly, we can be in bed together in the buff, and it doesn\u2019t warrant that we proceed any further than cuddling. If you can\u2019t handle that, state your boundaries up front, too.\n\nAnd While We\u2019re at It, I Can Stop at Any Time\n\nHold tight to your barf bag, boys and girls, because there are plenty of people who believe that if you start, both parties are obligated to finish the act. I don\u2019t care if you are five minutes away from climaxing; when I say stop, it means STOP. And it doesn\u2019t make me a prude or selfish; no simply means no. If there\u2019s even a possibility that your partner may want to slow down or is having second thoughts, with or without explanations, respect their wishes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in the BDSM World, No May Mean Yes\n\nDespite the stereotypes, BDSM is a lot more than just whips and chains. It is heavily dependent on trust in your partner. For those unfamiliar with the abbreviation, it\u2019s broken down into bondage, discipline/dominance, submission/sadism and masochism. As a \u201cswitch,\u201d I learned quickly about the importance of safe words when engaging in sexual activities with partners. Prior to the act, you should truly know your partner\u2019s desires and dislikes.\n\nMost important, establish safe words and touches and understand their body language. Without this discussion, things can go terribly wrong fairly quickly. Because words such as \u201cno\u201d and \u201cstop\u201d can be viewed as \u201cyes\u201d in the submissive and domination community, these terms are typically avoided as cues to stop during the act. Words like \u201cred,\u201d \u201cyellow\u201d and \u201cgreen\u201d\u2014reminiscent of traffic lights\u2014are great word selections. Know the difference between BDSM play and assault.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust a Thought: Avoid Vulnerable Partners\n\nAs an FYI, a heavily inebriated or exceptionally high partner cannot reliably give you consent. If your partner isn\u2019t coherent and you perform sexual acts with this person, this can later be considered equivalent to rape. Alcohol and drugs can impair someone\u2019s judgment severely. If the connection is truly there, ask and wait for validation when the other person is sober.\n\n\n\nIf They\u2019re Not of Legal Age, Guess What?\n\nDo I have to mention that minors also aren\u2019t legally allowed to consent to sexual relations with an adult? On that note: Parents should consider having conversations with teens before they enter junior high school. On average, Americans lose their virginity at 17 years old, but they are experimenting far earlier, so it\u2019s worth gradually sparking conversations about sex, protection and consent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParents: Don\u2019t view it as giving your children permission to lose their virginity, but more about their safety. Sexual education in school is on the decline, and caretakers should feel comfortable taking the responsibility to answer questions that their children may or may not have considered.\n\nRape and Sexual Harassment Are NOT Your Fault\n\nAbove all, know that you didn\u2019t ask for it. Rape and sexual harassment are not your fault. If you were raped or are uncertain whether you were sexually assaulted, please don\u2019t hesitate to seek assistance from organizations like RAINN, which will connect you to support groups or a talk therapist. Reach out to local authorities if you ever feel unsafe from a sexual predator. Know that you\u2019re not alone and that there are a host of places willing to help you through your trauma.

I want Gorsuch to be in limbo longer than Maze has been featuring Frankie Beverly.\n\nAnyway, these hearings have been weird as hell; below is all the weirdness I\u2019ve witnessed.\n\nDa Fuq Is an Originalist?\n\nThis is some cutesy shit that Gorsuch has made up to define himself as someone who follows the original interpretation of the Constitution and is legally rooted in now-deceased conservative Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s beliefs (the justice Gorsuch is replacing). You remember Scalia\u2014he was the man whose daughter invited Clarence Thomas out to his house for a weekend, and then a silent auction ensued and Thomas was relegated to \u201cthe sunken place.\u201d Anyway, Gorsuch wants to paint himself as a follower of Scalia, but Cosmopolitan has already debunked the myth with an article titled, \u201c9 Reasons Constitutional Originalism Is Bullsh*t.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI Would Have Walked Out the Door\u201d\n\nI highly doubt that Gorsuch would\u2019ve walked out of the room had then-President-elect Vladimir TrumPutin, aka Tiny Twitter Fingers, asked him to reverse Roe v.

Something tells me he wouldn\u2019t have been that offended or that rude.\n\nGorsuch and the Case of the Frozen Trucker\n\nThis is the case that the Democrats have been hammering away on because it shows that Gorsuch may have a tendency to follow the letter of the law even if it means that he comes off like a dick.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s how CNN describes the case:\n\nThe case involves a lawsuit brought by a trucker, Alphonse Maddin, against his former employer, Trans Am Trucking, which found its way to Gorsuch\u2019s current place of employment, the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Colorado. Here is how the judges who ruled in favor of Maddin describe the facts of the case: \u201cAlphonse Maddin was employed as a truck driver by ... TransAm Trucking. ... In January 2009, Maddin was transporting cargo through Illinois when the brakes on his trailer froze because of subzero temperatures. After reporting the problem to TransAm and waiting several hours for a repair truck to arrive, Maddin unhitched his truck from the trailer and drove away, leaving the trailer unattended. He was terminated for abandoning the trailer.\u201d At 11:17 p.m., Maddin called his emergency into a dispatcher who promised that help would be summoned. Two hours later at 1:18 a.m., Maddin was still waiting for help, but by now his torso and feet were feeling numb from the cold. It seems the heat in the truck wasn\u2019t working properly. The driver called in again, but this time a dispatcher warned him not to leave the freezing truck. He called the dispatcher again, saying he couldn\u2019t feel his feet and was having trouble breathing. Finally, Maddin unhooked the truck, pulled it 3 feet in front of the trailer and proceeded to call the dispatcher yet again. He was instructed either to drag the trailer with the frozen brakes with him\u2014probably an impossible task\u2014or continue to wait in the freezing cab until help arrived. Maddin ignored the order and drove away with what little gas he had left. For this act of insubordination, he was fired.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this is the part that the Dems, rightfully so, can\u2019t get over: Gorsuch agreed with the firing!\n\nGorsuch Sometimes Sounds Like Batman\n\nWhenever Gorsuch is grilled on something, like his court rulings or anything that is basically being asked by a Democrat, he does this weird thing with his voice where he drops it low (his voice, not his hind parts) to sound really serious, but he just ends up sounding like Batman, and it\u2019s weird and creepy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWatch the clip below and tell me you don\u2019t pick up shades of Batman:\n\nThe Black Woman to Gorsuch\u2019s Left\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t think for a second that the strategically placed black woman wasn\u2019t decided in a room long before the hearing. That seat isn\u2019t accidental. She\u2019s been there all three days looking attractive and African American. Nothing says, \u201cI\u2019m not racist\u201d\u2014which, to his credit, no one has said of Gorsuch\u2014like a strategically placed black woman.\n\nShoutout to Heavy.com for doing the Lord\u2019s work and finding out that the woman is named Mary Elizabeth Taylor and she works for the White House in the Legislative Affairs Unit.

Because sharing is caring. And I care. And for some of you, instead of feeling \u201cvery Olympic\u201d some days, you feel \u201cparticularly black.\u201d Or very black. And I\u2019m here to help with that. I\u2019m like Santa\u2019s Little Helper, perhaps the oldest dog of all time. My life is one big-ass non sequitur.\n\nThere are days when it\u2019s just too much. What is \u201cit\u201d? It. Shit, I don\u2019t know, man. Everything. Nothing. But whatever it is puts you in a space where you just feel particularly black. You pull out the T-shirt you got in college that says \u201cNat Turner University\u201d or pictures Fred Hampton and says, \u201cYou can kill the revolutionary but you can\u2019t kill the revolution,\u201d or that one with Huey Newton sitting in the wicker chair that might be one of the single blackest nonblack household items one can own.

Of course, there are more, but here\u2019s your start.\n\n1. \u201cFight the Power\u201d by Public Enemy\n\nI\u2019m not sure any playlist intended to have you walking around in your blackness would be complete without a song that was tailor-made for all of those Malcolm X hats, tees and medallions we stopped wearing in the early \u201990s.

Affirm yourself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cEbony Eyes\u201d by Rick James and Smokey Robinson\n\nI mean, have you heard this song? Of course you have; you\u2019re black. I don\u2019t even like Smokey Robinson\u2019s singing (love his songwriting), but this song just makes you want to love up on a woman with brown eyes. My bad\u2014ebony eyes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. \u201cBrown Skin Lady\u201d by Black Star\n\nAn ode to the all of the splendiferous traits of the black woman and her beauteousness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. \u201cBeautiful Skin\u201d by Goodie Mob\n\nThis song would ALMOST be perfect if it weren\u2019t steeped in respectability politics. But in that sense, it\u2019s a significant part of the black experience for so many. Plus, you can never have enough odes to black women, no matter how much kissing the sun did on you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. \u201cOptimistic\u201d by Sounds of Blackness\n\nI mean, come on. When you hear this song, don\u2019t you just FEEL blacker? And more hopeful?

Instead, I\u2019m curled up with my laptop this fine Saturday afternoon, editing and writing blogs for The Glow Up.\n\nBut there\u2019s definite gratification in writing about an amazing project like the Free Black Women\u2019s Library, a growing collection of books written by black women and collected and curated by artist, librarian and avowed book lover Ola Ronke.\n\nRonke started the project after becoming involved with the #SayHerName movement in response to a spate of stories about state-sanctioned violence that harmed and killed black women.\n\n\u201cI was kind of like, \u2018OK, I want to be a part of something where black women are centered and where black women are the focus. But it\u2019s not tragic, and it\u2019s not pathological, and it doesn\u2019t feel disempowering or discouraging. ... You know, we can talk about us black women as writers and artists and filmmakers and creatives and all these different things,\u2019\u201d Ronke told The Glow Up.\n\n\u201cSo, at the same time, we can also have conversations about this violence and about these issues ... but within these conversations will be more of a position of power,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe won\u2019t feel victimized or objectified or like a stereotype, but more like witches and healers and conjurers and problem-solvers and scientists and doctors ... just kind of, like, shifting energy around the conversation that takes place where black women are the focus.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe result was a mobile library of black female-centric books, where participants are encouraged to give one and take one, all in an effort to advance black female narratives.\n\n\u201cIt was my love of books and my wanting to connect with people around black women, but in a way that felt like a celebration or an honoring or an affirming,\u201d Ronke noted.\n\nSince launching three years ago, the library has grown to approximately 900 books. It was initially primarily based on donations but is now moving into sponsorships and collaborations. It\u2019s even launched a Reading Challenge for 2018 and a reading group, which you can join here:\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis Sunday, Jan. 28, Ronke and the Free Black Women\u2019s Library will help launch MFON: Women Photographers of the African Diaspora, a crowdfunded photography book celebrating various iterations of black womanhood. The project clearly reflects the mission Ronke has begun with her library.\n\n\u201cWe are celebrating the release of the gorgeous new photography book MFON: Women Photographers of the African Diaspora,\u201d she says. \u201cThis stunning work of art features the work of 118 black women photographers from all over the world. The brilliant women behind this work are Laylah Amatullah Barrayn and Adama Delphine Fawundu, founding co-editors-in-chief, and Crystal Whaley, deputy editor.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Ronke, both the library and events like these are a necessary next step in expanding the exposure and understanding of black womanhood.\n\n\u201cBlack women are variable and expansive\u2014and, like, different\u2014and there\u2019s really no way to categorize that. Because under the umbrella of black women, we could have a black trans person, or you could have a black person who wears a weave or locs or has a low cut or is skinny or in a wheelchair, you know? And we also have stay-at-home moms and the Wall Street executive. ... There [are] just so many ways to be a black woman.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe adds, \u201cSo, that was part of it, too: just pushing back against this idea that there\u2019s one type of black woman. We\u2019re not a monolith; we\u2019re just, like, so varied.

Their cases were continued for a later date, and a trial date has been set for Feb. 19.\n\nImmediately after the hearing, Durham County District Attorney Roger Echols said, \u201cWe won\u2019t try them on the felonies, only the misdemeanors.\u201d\n\nThe eight activists are represented by North Carolina Central University law professor Scott Holmes, who is also the supervising attorney of the school\u2019s Civil Litigation Clinic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHolmes, who had said in November that the felony charges would be dropped, did not have a comment on Thursday\u2019s hearing.\n\n\u201cI prefer to let those I represent speak for themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nFrom the Herald-Sun:\n\nTwelve people were initially charged with felonies accusing them of participating in a riot with property damage over $1,500 and inciting others to riot with property damage over $1,500. They also faced misdemeanors accusing them of injury to personal property over $200, injury to real property, and defacing or injuring a public monument.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow that the felony charges have been dropped, each of the activists now faces a new misdemeanor charge of conspiracy to deface real property.\n\nOf the 12 original activists charged in connection with the toppling of the statue, charges against three were dropped in November because of a lack of evidence that they participated in the act at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA fourth activist took a deferred prosecution agreement on three misdemeanor charges\u2014injury to real property, damage to personal property and defacing a public monument\u2014and in exchange will pay $1,250 in restitution and $180 in court costs and perform 100 hours of community service.\n\nThe felony charges would have had to be dropped against the activists because North Carolina law classifies a riot (pdf) as \u201ca public disturbance involving an assemblage of three or more persons which by disorderly and violent conduct, or the imminent threat of disorderly and violent conduct, results in injury or damage to persons or property or creates a clear and present danger of injury or damage to persons or property.\u201d\n\nYou have to be able to prove that all of those things are true in order to make a felony riot charge stick.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSheriff\u2019s investigators used video of the toppling to identify those involved and make arrests.

But the only mention of him that the recently opened National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., has is in reference to Anita Hill\u2019s testimony against him regarding sexual harassment during his confirmation hearings.\n\nTo rectify this, the conservative-leaning StandUnited recently launched a petition calling for Thomas to be included in the recently opened museum on the National Mall. Entitled \u201cDirector for Smithsonian Museum of African-American Culture and History, Lonnie Bunch III : Don\u2019t Overlook African American Leaders Like Justice Clarence Thomas,\u201d the petition was launched in early October and now has nearly 7,000 signatures.\n\nIn a somewhat scathing rebuke to the museum's director, Lonnie Bunch III, the petition page says that Thomas has been punished because of his political views. It reads in part:\n\n\n\nIt is obvious politics is what kept Justice Thomas out of the museum. For years, he has been shunned by the liberal black community since he has spoken out against affirmative action. He has written that affirmative action amounts to racial discrimination, and detailed how it worked against him when he was trying to find work as a lawyer. Curators at the museum singled out Thomas due to his unique views on race and his conservative thought that the federal government is the greatest threat to our individual liberties. The museum highlights people of less noble endeavors, and it is unfathomable to think the curators were not open-minded enough to include all historically significant African Americans, no matter their political beliefs. It is time to call on the museum\u2019s director, Lonnie Bunch III, to include American leaders and conservative thinkers such as Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cJustice Thomas has a uniquely American story, in all its complexity\u2014he grew up in the segregated South and is now the second-most-powerful African-American man in government,\u201d Angela Morabito, senior campaign manager of StandUnited, told CNSNews.com. \u201cPetition signers think he deserves credit for his extraordinary contributions to American government and constitutional scholarship.\u201d\n\nBefore it opened, the museum received some pushback for its Bill Cosby display. Cosby, a pioneer in television, has since been accused of rape by dozens of women. When the museum opened, the claims of sexual assault were included in his exhibit.\n\nRead more at CNSNews.com.", "keywords": ["national", "opened", "recently", "iii", "director", "african", "petition", "clarence", "american", "justice", "started", "include", "museum", "lonnie", "thomas"], "polarity": 0.12960526315789475, "subjectivity": 0.4425438596491228},

I shouldn\u2019t have such a high bar for the content of conversations I overhear in a busy food court, particularly in the section immediately adjacent to Panda Express. But alas, I still have the Obama hopey-changey bug, so I ate my orange chicken bowl and smiled warmly at the two suited men who sat next to me. Until they started talking.\n\n\u201cThey got James Franco, too? You can\u2019t even tell a woman she looks nice without getting #MeToo\u2019ed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe gotta be more careful out here. Where\u2019s our safe space?!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one iteration of a conversation I\u2019ve heard from men in the past few months that rests on a bed of balderdash more egregious than Panda\u2019s claim of authentic Chinese food. This particular myth is that:\n\n1. Men are being fired/prosecuted/publicly shamed for innocuous acts like a polite compliment.\n\nThis simply isn\u2019t true. Workplace harassment doesn\u2019t include pleasant niceties. The men who claim as much are either willfully ignorant or painfully stupid. There\u2019s \u201cHi, Sandra, you look nice today,\u201d and then there\u2019s \u201cWow, Sandra, you really filled out that dress well,\u201d which is typically accompanied with a lewd appraisal and delayed stare. Stop this gaslighting now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis idea is often paired with another nasty notion I\u2019ve heard repeated by both men and women (but let\u2019s be honest; according to my unofficial GroupMe survey, it\u2019s 95 percent men):\n\n2. It\u2019s only harassment when the harasser is unattractive or undesirable (e.g., Harvey Weinstein).\n\nFalse. Harassment has nothing to do with the appearance of the harasser and everything to do with the behavior of the harasser (and the fact that the recipient is uncomfortable, nonconsenting or simply not interested).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only do people presume that you want generic Idris Elba from your office\u2014you know, the guy with the confidence of Stringer Bell minus the accent and with a stare that\u2019s more dehumanizing than smoldering\u2014but they presume that your response is an indication of whether or not the act is harassment. Which brings me to the next misconception:\n\n3. If a person doesn\u2019t immediately denounce a harasser or, worse, dares to laugh along, he or she must have liked it.\n\nWrong again. In the \u201950s and \u201960s, when domestics were asked by their employers, \u201cWhat do you think of all this civil rights stuff? We treat you good, right?\u201d they often replied something to the effect of, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t fool with that. I don\u2019t want anything to do with that trouble.\u201d They didn\u2019t mean it then, and women don\u2019t always mean it now when we laugh off men\u2019s harassment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy nature of the power that a harasser often has over a woman\u2014whether it be their seniority, their popularity in the office or simply their ability to make you look like an aggressive woman (and, for some of us, an angry black woman)\u2014women are often left with few choices. So if you hear a conversation like this:\n\nHim: You should wear skirts more often; you\u2019ve got such great legs! No wonder the client loves you. Her: It\u2019s either that or my ability to turn around contracts in record time. Total toss-up! Haha!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s no need for you to conclude that she appreciated it. For one, consider how infuriating it is for women in the workplace, corporate or otherwise, to have to consistently assert to others that we should be judged based on the work we do versus how we look.\n\nSecond, think about the consequences a woman faces for calling out the fan of her skirts. She could be ostracized, viewed as aggressive, dragged through a lengthy HR process that ends in little or no action aside from a waste of her time, or, worse, passed up for opportunities because she didn\u2019t go along to get along.\n\nI realize that most of my examples are related to men harassing women. But that brings me to the next myth:\n\n4. Women are the only recipients of workplace harassment, and the perpetrators are always men.\n\nNope. My husband likes to joke that before he introduces himself to people, he tells them he\u2019s married, just so there\u2019s \u201cno confusion.\u201d While the sexual harassment he\u2019s experienced likely pales in comparison with my own experiences, it doesn\u2019t negate his. He attended a holiday party with me a few years back, and I recall a complete stranger squeezing his bicep while cooing, \u201cI wish my husband would go to the gym.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNah, sis. Keep your hands, feet and all other objects to yourself because I can\u2019t control my reflexes and your health depends on it. (That\u2019s the rule we learned in kindergarten, right?)\n\nIn short, with all that women have to deal with in the workplace\u2014and I\u2019m not even speaking to the unimaginable horrors endured by working-class women and domestic workers who often have no recourse\u2014I can assure you that the majority of us really aren\u2019t interested in entertaining anyone\u2019s advances while there, whether the pursuer is Michael B. Jordan or Flavor Flav, at least not on the clock. The men who know better really aren\u2019t about that life, either.\n\nBe friendly, not flirty. Be fierce, not forceful. Help keep your workplace a safe haven, not a, ah ... what\u2019s another presidential phrase that begins with an \u201cs\u201d and an \u201ch\u201d?

Kennedy said social media has become the public square and a place for discussion and debate.\n\n\u201cThe sites that Justice Kagan has described and their utility and the extent of their coverage are greater than the communication you could have ever had, even in the paradigm of public square,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor said the North Carolina law has economic consequences as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTake something like LinkedIn, which many, many people in our society today are looking for jobs there, but high school students are permitted to look for jobs and to post their personal data on that site,\u201d Sotomayor said.\n\nKennedy added that any number of free-speech doctrines doomed the law.\n\nJustice Stephen G.

Does it limit free speech? Dramatically. Are there other, less restrictive ways of doing it? We\u2019re not sure, but we think probably, as you\u2019ve mentioned some. OK. End of case, right?\u201d\n\nFrom the Times:\n\nThe law was challenged by Lester Packingham, who had pleaded guilty in 2002 to taking indecent liberties with a minor when he was a 21-year-old college student. He received a suspended sentence and two years\u2019 probation and was made to register as a sex offender. Mr. Packingham came to the attention of the authorities in 2010, when he wrote on Facebook about having a traffic ticket dismissed. \u201cGod is good,\u201d he wrote. A North Carolina appeals court ruled that the law \u201carbitrarily burdens all registered sex offenders by preventing a wide range of communication and expressive activity unrelated to achieving its purported goal\u201d of protecting minors. In a 4-to-2 ruling, the North Carolina Supreme Court reversed the appeals court\u2019s decision, saying that Mr. Packingham\u2019s Facebook post was not entitled to heightened First Amendment protection because it was conduct rather than speech.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMontgomery argued that the state of North Carolina is entitled to limit Packingham\u2019s speech and said that the law left sex offenders with plenty of other ways to exercise their First Amendment rights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the entire internet that is being taken away from these offenders,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cThey can still have their own blog. They can read blogs. They can do podcasts. They can go to nytimes.com.\u201d\n\nMontgomery also said that the state had tried to write the law narrowly and to address the danger of lurking predators quietly harvesting personal information about minors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKagan said that the distinctions the North Carolina law drew made no sense.\n\n\u201cSo you mean that there\u2019s a constitutional right to use Snapchat, but not to use Twitter?\u201d she asked.\n\nMore from the Times:\n\nJustice Breyer asked Mr. Montgomery for any First Amendment precedent that allowed such a broad suppression of speech. The lawyer cited a 1992 decision, Burson v. Freeman, in which the Supreme Court upheld a 100-foot buffer zone around polling places. Justice Kennedy was not impressed. \u201cI think that does not help you at all,\u201d he said, as the buffer zone was limited in size and applied to everyone. \u201cYou could have all the political speech in the world\u201d outside the zone, he added. Justice Kagan said a restriction on using social media was quite different. \u201cHow many people under 30 do you think don\u2019t use these sites to get all their information?\u201d she asked. \u201cUnder 35? I mean, increasingly, this is the way people get all information.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJustice Samuel A.

In the past four years, the third-generation hairstylist has been making her mark on Marvel films, leading the hair departments of the last two Captain America films, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and, now, Black Panther.\n\nOf course, the Black Panther is a unique superhero, and Black Panther is already proving to be an exceptionally unique film, as Friend tells The Glow Up:\n\nI think Black Panther is\u2014I call it a stand-alone Marvel movie, even though Marvel still has a formula. But I feel like it\u2019s a stand-alone movie, especially for me, because I\u2019m a black woman, and [to do] the first black superhero, that was really an honor, in the sense [that] we\u2019re presenting all of this to the world. We had an important job to do, and I looked at it in a whole different way, because it represents my people. So I felt like, the weight of the world on me at some points, but in the greatest way\u2014that I had the opportunity to present us in the best possible light and put something on camera that\u2019s never been [seen]. So it\u2019s a great responsibility and it\u2019s a great challenge, but it\u2019s my greatest joy in doing it, also.\n\nRepresenting her people was paramount in Friend\u2019s mind as she approached the task of helping to bring Black Panther to life. To begin, she divided the film into three elements: traditional Africa, contemporary Africa and the futuristic Africa represented by the technologically advanced civilization that is Wakanda. In her research, she drew inspiration from everything from traditional African tribes like the Maasai and Zulu to the groundbreaking fashion statements we\u2019ve seen at Afropunk celebrations around the globe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really taking and looking at traditional styles, traditional tribal looks, and seeing what we can make into a modern style,\u201d Friend says. \u201cI like to take, like, a period hairstyle and put it in a modern movie and just put a twist on it. For me, it\u2019s still about classic hairdressing and beautiful lines and silhouettes. That\u2019s how I design hair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriend has certainly had her share of experience with period styles, having also headed the hair departments of Miles Ahead, The Help, Django Unchained, Rock of Ages and Dreamgirls. But whether it\u2019s long and flowing or elaborately braided and twisted, one thing you won\u2019t see in Black Panther is any straightened hair. For Friend, natural hair textures were a major part of her contribution to the visual narrative.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a beautiful time where people are wearing their natural hair,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, there [are] women everywhere who are like, \u2018Throw the pressing comb away, throw the relaxer away. I\u2019m going to wear my natural hair.\u2019 So that whole movement of the empowerment of the hair is there,\u201d Friend explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a diverse universe of naturally styled characters involved a team highly skilled in styling, caring for and mimicking natural hairstyles, as in the case of Angela Bassett\u2019s glorious custom-made wig of 24-inch silvery locs, inspired in equal parts by writer Toni Morrison and director Ryan Coogler\u2019s mother, Joselyn.\n\nBut while Friend isn\u2019t playing favorites on the styles she created, she\u2019s already seeing the influence this film is having on our beauty and fashion choices. She\u2019s received countless raves on the twisted crop Lupita Nyong\u2019o rocks as Dora Milaje operative Nakia and graciously provided The Glow Up with the how-to (hint: The key is keeping it close to the scalp):\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018Wakanda knot\u2019\u2014because it is different than a Bantu knot,\u201d she tells us. \u201c[Because] basically, the hair is rolled down, kind of like a cinnamon roll. And then, once the hair is dried, then, we lifted it from there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEducating other hairstylists is a huge part of Friend\u2019s career, as her greatest hope is to see more hairstylists performing at the top of their game. That\u2019s why she created Hair Scholars, a consortium of award-winning artists led by Friend in educating and preparing aspiring stylists to be the best at their craft and ready to work in the industry.\n\nFriend knows firsthand the value of having a talented team by her side. She credits her Black Panther team for being a large part of the inspiration and craftsmanship that we\u2019ll see on-screen next week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt just felt like our brains\u2014the brainpower was just so high, and the energy was so high, just because we got to create,\u201d she says. \u201cOr somebody\u2019s like, \u2018Well, let\u2019s try this.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Let\u2019s try it!\u2019\n\n\u201cSo it was really great to have that think tank, where we could just be in there and be creating, and just really coming up with things on the fly ... just really having the momentum just to create original pieces that are going to stand the test of time on film,\u201d she continues.\n\nAnd of course, we couldn\u2019t end our conversation without asking Friend how it felt to be on the purple carpet for Black Panther\u2019s epic premiere in Los Angeles last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe premiere was like, you know, it was like 2018 Coming to America\u2014like, it was for real. People took it all the way,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think what it is too, is as black people, we have like\u2014especially now\u2014there\u2019s a sense of pride. People are wearing their hair natural. People are [saying] \u2018black excellence.\u2019 People are rising to the occasion, and I think this movie comes at the time where black people, we want to step forward; we want to be recognized.\n\n\u201cThis movie hits all the right notes for having a black superhero,\u201d she explains. \u201cI mean, at the end of the day, we all want to be superheroes, in whatever we do. If we\u2019re a mom, if we\u2019re a secretary, if we\u2019re a hairdresser\u2014whatever we do, we all want to be a superhero.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re an Los Angeles-based hair artist, you can join Camille Friend for a Hair Scholars master class at the \u201cHair and Makeup by ... \u201d Symposium on March 11 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.", "keywords": ["natural", "traditional", "hair", "black", "hero", "really", "teamsupernatural", "movie", "panther", "meet", "panthers", "having", "think", "friend", "camille", "designer"], "polarity": 0.17398076259489295, "subjectivity": 0.5284920634920632},

Vulture writer John Kennedy did the Lord\u2019s work and ranked Jay-Z\u2019s songs from worst to best.\n\nOf course, most people scrolled right to the bottom\u2014the longest scroll ever; it was like a Ta-Nehisi Coates-article scroll\u2014to see what was ranked as Jay\u2019s best. The answer?\n\nFind out, after these messages!\n\nJust kidding.\n\n\u201cHard Knock Life\u201d was ranked as his best song. While I can see some folks arguing about this, I tend to agree. The piece basically makes the case that it\u2019s the song that changed Jay\u2019s career, and I agree. Also, the song itself is one of his most innovative and dope records. It would be one thing if, I don\u2019t know, \u201cLucky Me\u201d were listed as numero uno. \u201cHard Knock Life\u201d changed everything for Jay and sent him on the road to that billi he\u2019s headed toward. My personal favorite \u201cCan I Live?\u201d came in at No. 2.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI won\u2019t even pretend that I read through each entry, and the article seemed to generally follow along the way you\u2019d expect, with many songs from Kingdom Come, Magna Carta ... Holy Grail and Blueprint 2, plus the R. Kelly albums, toward the end. Look, it doesn\u2019t really matter what song came in No. 176 (\u201cOh My God\u201d) or even No. 254 (\u201cStranded [Haiti Mon Amour]\u201d). Ranking those songs was a labor of love, I assure you, and only because he began the undertaking did Kennedy even have to listen to them.\n\nNope, the only songs that really mattered are Nos. 1, 2-10 and the very last fucking song, 274. And what was ranked as Jay\u2019s worst song?\n\n\u201cAnything\u201d from the Kingdom Come album. Not \u201cAnything,\u201d the b0nus cut on Vol. 3, or from Beanie Sigel\u2019s The Truth album. THAT \u201cAnything\u201d was straight fire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHmmm. Several songs from Kingdom Come could make this slot. In fact, if EYE had to pick what I think is the worst Jay song, it would be the song that follows \u201cAnything\u201d on KC, \u201cHollywood,\u201d one of his many horrendous joint songs with Queen Beyonc\u00e9. On this list, \u201cHollywood\u201d in all its putrescence is ranked at No. 263. I think we call that \u201cmercy\u201d in the religious community.\n\nHow bad is \u201cHollywood\u201d? It\u2019s so bad, I couldn\u2019t find a YouTube video of the song. It\u2019s so bad that when I pulled it up on Tidal, I immediately got mad that I pay $9.99 a month to listen to this song. This song is so bad that even Beyonc\u00e9 couldn\u2019t save it. Even Jay\u2019s flow on the song is basura. This song is bad on an album full of bad songs. Even now, I went back and listened to \u201cAnything\u201d and almost decided that \u201cAnything\u201d IS the worst, but nope, I have visceral reactions to \u201cHollywood,\u201d mostly because why, Jay, did you make this song? Bey is the only good thing about this super-contrived-ass song.\n\nIt\u2019s as if Jay said, \u201cI need a song that sounds like a good radio song; somebody queue some trash up,\u201d and Young Guru said, \u201cSay no more.\u201d Maybe I\u2019m being harsh, but to me, it\u2019s that bad. You know, I\u2019m surprised nobody has pointed out that all of their best collaborations happened on Beyonc\u00e9 albums. \u201cUpgrade You,\u201d \u201cDrunk in Love,\u201d \u201cCrazy in Love,\u201d etc. Meanwhile, Jay has \u201cHollywood,\u201d \u201cBonnie and Clyde \u201903\u201d and \u201cLift Off,\u201d though the latter was on the Watch the Throne album. Point is, Bey kept the best collabos for herself. She smart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo you know how sometimes people say things like, \u201cEven though it\u2019s the worst, that doesn\u2019t make something bad\u201d? Yeah, that doesn\u2019t apply here. \u201cAnything\u201d is legit a terrible song. When your favorite artists are prolific and have a tremendous output, not everything is going to be good, but bad is bad, man. Shit. And \u201cAnything\u201d is amazingly bad.\n\nI don\u2019t know if anybody has ever asked Jay about that song (probably not), but I know I\u2019ve often wondered what goes on in the head of these artists when they hear certain songs and decide, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s it right there.\u201d Granted, perhaps there are other factors at work and there\u2019s a sound he was going for. I\u2019ve often felt that way about \u201cJustify My Thug\u201d on The Black Album.\n\nThe Black Album is easily one of Jay\u2019s best albums. On my personal list, it\u2019s No. 3 after Reasonable Doubt and The Blueprint and, now, right before 4:44. But \u201cJustify My Thug\u201d always felt like an anomaly to me. The beat, produced by one of my all-time favorites, DJ Quik, felt like a throwaway. Even the song itself seemed ... ungood. It made No. 218 on the Vulture list.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, the good thing about an artist of Jay\u2019s caliber is that the good faaaaaar outweighs the bad. And there\u2019s so much good. The good is full of so many highs and cultural landmarks that, short of Jay releasing an album full of records that all sound like \u201cHollywood\u201d or \u201cAnything\u201d or \u201cSuper Ugly\u201d (which, to its credit, had the SUPER dope \u201cBad Intentions\u201d beat from Dr. Dre and Knoc-Turn\u2019Al), he\u2019ll be all right.\n\nPlus, when you\u2019ve been around for a solid 20-plus years, constantly putting in work, the bottom of that list tends to be forgotten out of respect. And ultimately, Jay probably laughs about such things as he walks into the bank and they roll out the red carpet and pour him glasses of D\u2019Uss\u00e9 while he says, \u201cAm I still rich?\u201d and the bankers say, \u201cYes, Jay, sir, you are still rich.\u201d\n\nBut just know that if anybody you know ever tells you that a) Kingdom Come is their favorite Jay album and b) \u201cAnything\u201d (or \u201cHollywood\u201d) is their favorite song, they are not to be trusted.", "keywords": ["kingdom", "hollywood", "really", "come", "jays", "bad", "jayzs", "know", "worst", "songs", "good", "jay", "song", "album"], "polarity": 0.05103646353646356, "subjectivity": 0.5874589673147363},

Quinn, described by one of the editors he supervised as \u201cthe conscience of Gannett for many years, having inspired the most aggressive diversity movement of the 20th century,\u201d died Tuesday in Carolina, R.I. He was 91.\n\nThe description came from Bennie Ivory, retired top editor at Gannett\u2019s Courier-Journal in Louisville, Ky. It was echoed by others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMark Silverman, former publisher of the Detroit News, called Quinn \u201cclearly one of the most influential and innovative journalists of his generation. He was a true champion of diversity, an articulate voice for quality journalism, and a friend of everyone he recruited or mentored. In a company always racing into the future, John was the voice of quality and of doing the right thing.\u201d\n\nQuinn was top editor of USA Today, president of Gannett News Service and vice president of news at Gannett Co. Inc. before retiring in 1990. He also was a former deputy chairman of the Freedom Forum, as Tyler Vazquez reported Tuesday for Florida Today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor legions of journalists of color, Quinn was more.\n\n\u201cIt is going to take a while for me to get my thoughts in one space because this remarkable human being taught me that I did not have to be on guard because of my race or gender,\u201d Karen Howze, a former Gannett editor who found a second career as a judge, wrote below Ivory\u2019s post on Facebook. \u201cHe always knew the temper of the time and read all so well.\n\n\u201cThere are so many conversations where he and his wife relied on those like me but he also puzzled about some of crab in the bucket dynamics that affected all those he championed. . . . He was my boss. My friend a second family member before I left the business and after. . . . He was and will always be the real. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first sentence in a tribute Wednesday from Colleen Fitzpatrick at the Newseum Institute wasn\u2019t about his broader accomplishments, but that Quinn and his wife, Lois, \u201cfounded one of the premier journalism diversity programs in the country after he retired from a newspaper career. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Chips Quinn Scholars program, named for the couple\u2019s eldest son and funded by the Newseum Institute, has provided training and internships to nearly 1,400 student journalists of color since its founding in 1991.\n\n\u201c \u2018The Chips Quinn program has changed the face and fabric of newsrooms across the country thanks to John and Loie Quinn\u2019s vision and commitment to diversity,\u2019 said Kristen Go, a 1996 and 1997 Scholar,\u201d referring to Lois Quinn by the name she was commonly called. \u201c \u2018The program gave me the confidence in my skills, support to grow as a journalist and the idea to dream big \u2013 that one day, I could become a top newsroom editor who could hire other Chips Quinn Scholars.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuinn walked the walk on diversity and helped pave the sidewalk.\n\nWhen USA Today commemorated its 25th anniversary in 2007, Quinn explained to Journal-isms how the newspaper assembled its inaugural staff.\n\n\u201cIt was a little frustrating,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cSome of my colleagues would say, \u2018I know this great person who can do what we want.\u2019 We said, \u2018We\u2019ve got a lot of those; we\u2019ve got to have somebody else.\u2019 \u201d And sometimes that meant going outside Gannett, the nation\u2019s largest newspaper company, to find them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe percentage of people of color at USA Today\u2019s founding, Quinn said, exceeded that of the nation as well as the newspaper industry. Of the five managing editors, two were women. At the level below them were two more women and two African Americans. The average age was 30. \u201cMore important, we had the talent we needed,\u201d Quinn said.\n\nWanda Lloyd, another retired Gannett editor of color, said then, \u201cUSA Today really set the pace for this industry in terms of content diversity. It was perceived by some, including readers, as going too far.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe paper had a rule that a person of color and a woman had to be on the front page, above the fold, every day.\u201cWhat that did was, because USA Today\u2019s Page One is kind of a billboard for the rest of the newspaper, it forced the rest of the newspaper to be diverse. You had to have people of color in Life and women in Sports.\u201d\n\nIf African Americans did not rise above the deputy managing editor level, Quinn said, they went elsewhere within Gannett to become publishers and editors.\n\nIn a USA Today tribute Tuesday, Rick Jervis, a Cuban American from Miami and a 1993 Chips Quinn Scholar, recalled feeling as though he didn\u2019t belong at Freedom Forum headquarters in Arlington, Va., where the program was based.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was put at ease. Later, he worked at the Miami Herald, where he was part of a Pulitzer Prize-winning team, then left to freelance in Eastern Europe.\n\nJervis wrote of Quinn, \u201cI leaned on him for career counseling and overall support. After returning to the U.S., I went and spoke to new Chips Quinn scholarship winners. Each time, Quinn and Loie welcomed me back with hugs, like family members. I was in constant awe at the energy and ambition he instilled in the scholarship winners, the sense of belonging. He memorized names, hometowns, colleges.\n\n\u201cIn one of my last communications with him, 12 years ago, I wrote to him to tell him I had accepted a job at USA TODAY, his alma mater. It was probably his proudest of my accomplishments. I still have his hand-written reply.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cQuinn\u2019s passing will be felt in newsrooms across the USA as hundreds of journalists remember the perched glasses and smiles that greeted them during their nerve-racking scholarship run. In today\u2019s age of alternate facts and fake news allegations, his lessons are more pertinent than ever.\u201d\n\nRecalling Quinn\u2019s instructions, Jervis concluded, \u201cWe should all remember to pursue the truth, write short, and never forget we belong. Thanks again, John. . . .\u201d\n\nFitzpatrick, a career coach with the Chips Quinn program since 2000, reported that \u201cThe funeral will be held on Saturday, July 15th from the Carolina Mill at 9 a.m. with mass at St. Mary\u2019s Church (437 Carolina Back Road) in Carolina at 10 a.m. Burial will be at White Brook Cemetery in Carolina.

In addition to lawsuits accusing the cable news network of \u2018abhorrent, intolerable, unlawful and hostile racial discrimination,\u2019 there have also been allegations of sexual harassment. Additionally, the lack of diversity in key positions, is a major concern for NABJ. . . .\u201d It did not name the key positions.\n\nMichael Gibson, chairman of the CVG Group LLC, which purchased Ebony from Johnson Publishing Co. last year, did not respond to a request for comment, nor did a Fox News spokeswoman.\n\nDana Canedy Named Pulitzer Administrator\n\n\u201cDana Canedy, a former senior editor at The New York Times, will be the next administrator of journalism\u2019s most prestigious award,\u201d Sydney Ember reported Wednesday for the Times, placing black journalists in the administrator\u2019s as well as the board chairman\u2019s post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cColumbia University announced on Wednesday that Ms. Canedy would replace Mike Pride as administrator of the Pulitzer Prizes, effective Monday.

See who is speaking here. Read and hear all 30 stories here.\u201d\n\nThe Star-Ledger, headquartered in Newark, is part of NJ Advance Media. Just before the eruption, Editor Mort Pye assigned three African Americans in the Star-Ledger newsroom, this columnist included, to survey the mood of Newark\u2019s black community, given conflagrations in other cities. The unrest exploded in the middle of our reporting, and a \u201cwhy the riot happened\u201d piece was published on Sunday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Journal-isms author was still a college student, working part-time at the newspaper. Ernest Johnston Jr., the Star-Ledger\u2019s only full-time black reporter and its first, later worked at the New York Post, the Amsterdam News, the Jersey Journal and the National Urban League before his death in 2000 at age 61. Charlie Dryden was a copy aide, then called a \u201ccopy boy.\u201d The title was later changed throughout newsrooms to avoid shouting \u201cboy!\u201d at black men who held the job.\n\nIn his memoir \u201cBlack Is the Color of My TV Tube,\u201d the late New York television journalist Gil Noble wrote about his sudden employment opportunity at New York\u2019s WABC-TV, flagship of the ABC network, Todd Steven Burroughs recalled in 2011 for Black Agenda Report.\n\nNoble made reference to the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, known as the Kerner Commission, which shook the news media in 1968 with its declaration that \u201cthe journalistic profession has been shockingly backward in seeking out, hiring, training, and promoting Negroes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018The mass media had been caught with their zippers down,\u2019 wrote Noble. \u2018Red-faced executives scurried about, seeking Blacks for on-air and other job activities. What more logical place to find Black media persons than the so-called soul stations and newspapers? Within a year, many of us found ourselves downtown at major radio and TV stations....None of the stations said we were being hired because of the prescriptions of the Kerner Commission\u2019s report. They all maintained, and they still do, that they are committed to being equal-opportunity companies. If asked about pressure, they would say, \u2018What pressure?\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is also not mentioned by these employers, but mentioned by Noble and other Black journalists of his generation, is that they were needed for another reason: White journalists, many of whom had never taken the time to cover Black communities adequately, were understandably and correctly getting their tails kicked while trying to cover those that were exploding in 1967 and 1968.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAfter a brief tryout, Noble\u2019s hiring by WABC was cinched when he was sent to cover the Newark rebellion. \u2018The news director had decided to hire me,\u2019 wrote Noble. \u2018I wearily returned home to tell my wife the good news and was acutely aware of the countless brothers and sisters who were still encircled within the National Guard barricades. Their uprising had been at least partially responsible for my new employment.\u2019 When King was assassinated less than a year later, WABC made another decision: he would contribute to a new Sunday program. . . .\u201d\n\nThe Kerner report led to training programs for journalists of color and increased hiring.\n\nAs reported in this space last week, a panel at the joint convention of the American Society of News Editors, the Associated Press Media Editors and the Associated Press Photo Managers this fall will discuss \u201cKerner Commission at 50: What did we get right?

But fine words on diversity need to be matched with firm actions \u2013 and this week\u2019s One Thing details my plans to ensure our company recruits, retains and rewards a diverse workforce.\n\n\u201cIn the immediate term, I am in the process of hiring a diversity and inclusion specialist to lead, audit and advise on diversity issues across Dow Jones. It is imperative that we both understand our own data and act upon it with reference to the very best of practice. The diversity and inclusion specialist will put in place the infrastructure we need to support our diversity and inclusion efforts. This will feature a Diversity & Inclusion Council, drawn from staff across the company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPromoting gender equality within our company will be the critical, initial focus. This is not the limit of our ambition in promoting diversity \u2014 rather, it is a starting point. Thanks in part to the cultural diagnostic work, which so many colleagues took part in and that we carried out at the start of the year, I recognize that other areas \u2013 such as ethnicity, sexual orientation, flexible working, disability and veteran status \u2014 are all issues and opportunities that need to be championed.\n\n\u201cThe need, though, to improve the career chances and choices of women is pressing. I am, of course, committed to ensuring pay equity across the company and this process continues, as evidenced by the recently completed second annual review. Analysis showed that an additional 2% of our employees needed further adjustments to their salaries to better align with others in similar roles and at similar levels. This included both men and women and spanned multiple ethnicities. But pay equity is only part of the issue. I will, therefore, also introduce a new Accelerated Management Program for women \u2013 initially for 25 candidates drawn from different departments. This program will help develop, coach and mentor individuals to advance and accelerate their careers at Dow Jones and beyond.\n\n\u201cBased on work already underway and the efforts of our new diversity and inclusion expert, I will also set a new, company-wide target of executive-level women for every Dow Jones department. As things stand, I will set this target at 40% initially. This will be the first of a number of diversity goals I will identify.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTo be clear, diversity and inclusion will be fundamental to our future success. We need to draw upon a wide range of backgrounds, experiences and ideas to ensure we stay relevant and responsive to our customers.

Battaglia at a hearing Thursday morning, the Herald-Sun reports. Their cases were continued for a later date, and a trial date has been set for Feb. 19.\n\nImmediately after the hearing, Durham County District Attorney Roger Echols said, \u201cWe won\u2019t try them on the felonies, only the misdemeanors.\u201d\n\nThe eight activists are represented by North Carolina Central University law professor Scott Holmes, who is also the supervising attorney of the school\u2019s Civil Litigation Clinic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHolmes, who had said in November that the felony charges would be dropped, did not have a comment on Thursday\u2019s hearing.\n\n\u201cI prefer to let those I represent speak for themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nFrom the Herald-Sun:\n\nTwelve people were initially charged with felonies accusing them of participating in a riot with property damage over $1,500 and inciting others to riot with property damage over $1,500. They also faced misdemeanors accusing them of injury to personal property over $200, injury to real property, and defacing or injuring a public monument.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow that the felony charges have been dropped, each of the activists now faces a new misdemeanor charge of conspiracy to deface real property.\n\nOf the 12 original activists charged in connection with the toppling of the statue, charges against three were dropped in November because of a lack of evidence that they participated in the act at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA fourth activist took a deferred prosecution agreement on three misdemeanor charges\u2014injury to real property, damage to personal property and defacing a public monument\u2014and in exchange will pay $1,250 in restitution and $180 in court costs and perform 100 hours of community service.\n\nThe felony charges would have had to be dropped against the activists because North Carolina law classifies a riot (pdf) as \u201ca public disturbance involving an assemblage of three or more persons which by disorderly and violent conduct, or the imminent threat of disorderly and violent conduct, results in injury or damage to persons or property or creates a clear and present danger of injury or damage to persons or property.\u201d\n\nYou have to be able to prove that all of those things are true in order to make a felony riot charge stick.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSheriff\u2019s investigators used video of the toppling to identify those involved and make arrests.

Hill sat before the Senate Judiciary Committee and testified about sexual harassment by then-Supreme Court hopeful Clarence Thomas. She testified about his commentary regarding her physical appearance and someone leaving a pubic hair on his soda can. It was shocking. Fast-forward to 2016, and here we are again: Donald Trump is a presidential candidate, and several women have come forward to say that they were harassed.\n\nUnlike Thomas, who denied the allegations and went so far as to invoke America\u2019s racist history to invalidate the claims (and prevailed), Trump not only has been accused but has admitted to sexual assault. We\u2019ve watched him use a woman\u2019s appearance as justification for why he couldn\u2019t have sexually assaulted them. In the same span of time, he\u2019s dismissed vulgar comments outlining how he\u2019s actually sexually assaulted women as \u201cjust locker-room talk.\u201d Many women and elected officials alike have indicated that they\u2019ll still vote for him even if \u201csolid\u201d evidence surfaces. Never mind the fact that he bantered about those behaviors.\n\nMany pundits and think pieces hailed Hill for paving the way for the female victims of sexual assault to come forward and have their stories be heard. However, I believe it did more than just that. Hill was indeed a pillar of strength and hope for victims of sexual assault who felt voiceless, but her story highlighted how easily people in power can use sexual abuse for political gain and fodder. There\u2019s no denying that Trump has used his power and influence to perpetuate sexual harm on women, and he\u2019s escaping relatively unscathed (minus a slight decrease in polls).\n\nI was 10 years old when Hill went through that hearing. I was in awe that a black woman had the audacity to actually say something against a man like Thomas, whom many respected. But the sad truth is that even as a young child, I could see and feel the unspoken belief that a woman\u2019s body wasn\u2019t her own. I have an amazing mother who taught me about body ownership, while society told me that things like what happened to Hill \u201chappen sometimes.\u201d\n\nI would listen in on the conversations that my mother and her sorority sisters would have about ascending the ranks in the workplace, and their stories contradicted the very premise of body ownership my mom was trying so hard to ingrain in me. She knew that she was raising a young woman in a society that wouldn\u2019t value my body or well-being, so she did what she could to prepare me. I\u2019m sure Hill\u2019s mother and the mothers of Trump\u2019s victims can relate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo me, what was more audacious about Hill was that the she was a black woman who spoke out knowing the consequences; she knew early on that her life would be mercilessly scrutinized. Sexual partners, preferences and the like would be discussed and used as means of justifying Thomas\u2019 behavior. This is how we discussed and dealt with sexual assault and harassment on a national platform then, and it still rings true today.\n\nHillary Clinton recently tweeted, \"Every sexual assault victim should be heard and believed.\u201d Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway retweeted it. She used it as a basis to help her candidate introduce the \u201cClinton accusers\u201d into the political conversation. When Trump began facing his allegations, she waffled. Likewise, Clinton supporters were ready to pounce on the other candidate and wholeheartedly believed his accusers. However, when it comes to Bill Clinton, some of his supporters believe that \u201c it doesn\u2019t matter because he is not running for office.\u201d Actually, it does matter. It all matters.\n\nEvery victim of sexual assault should be heard and believed. It shouldn\u2019t take something like an act of Congress before women are heard and believed. Hill sat in front of Congress and was told, by a confirmation vote, that political power was more important than her dignity. As with President Bill Clinton, Bill Cosby and now Trump, when women come forward, very rarely are they initially believed, if at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does this say about us, about our culture as a nation? It says that we in some way support, are purveyors of or are blissfully ignorant of rape culture. If we do not believe sexual assault victims, then we are the problem. Picking and choosing whom to believe, and politicizing rape and sexual violence, are the problems. We are the problem\u2014and therefore the same culture we decry is the same culture we are promoting.\n\nSo, Anita F. Hill, thank you for being brave and speaking your truth in the face of great opposition. Thank you for paving the way for us to discuss sexual harassment and assault in an open forum. And thank you for showing women of all races that it is possible to call out people in power for the violence and harm they cause.

What\u2019s currently prevalent in the pieces responding to Babe\u2019s Ansari story are hyperbole, intellectual dishonesty and red herrings.\n\nIn her response to Babe\u2019s article, \u201cAziz Ansari Is Guilty. Of Not Being a Mind Reader,\u201d the New York Times\u2019 Bari Weiss shrieks, \u201cThe insidious attempts by some women to criminalize awkward, gross, and entitled sex takes women back to the days of smelling salts, and fainting couches.\u201d The Los Angeles Times, unafraid to ask the \u201ctough\u201d questions, pondered, \u201cIs Aziz Ansari a Victim or Perpetrator?\u201d\n\nNot to be outdone in the histrionics competition, The Atlantic published \u201cThe Humiliation of Aziz Ansari,\u201d in which writer Caitlin Flanagan calls Babe\u2019s piece \u201c3,000 words of revenge porn\u201d and eagerly paints \u201cGrace\u201d as a nefarious, resentful, mean girl hell-bent on making Ansari pay for rejecting her, declaring, \u201cTogether, [Grace and Babe writer Katie Way] may have destroyed Ansari\u2019s career.\u201d\n\nIronically, the same parties who stress the necessity of having stringent qualifications for proper claims of sexual assault and victimhood\u2014of which they deem Grace unworthy\u2014have less demanding standards of proof when it comes to bestowing Ansari with their own thorny crowns of victimization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir flimsy concern about \u201cinfantilizing\u201d women is nothing short of laughable as they indulge in their anti-fourth-wave-feminism hysterics and pull a 34-year-old man to their heaving bosoms like vigilant caretakers, rendering him incapable of anything more malignant than simply being a creepy and inattentive sexual partner.\n\nReality is much less fantastical. Babe\u2019s piece, flawed as it may be, did not send society as we know it into a tailspin of anomie. Scores of hapless men who merely attempt conversation or interaction with women who pique their sexual interest are not being apprehended by a feminist gestapo for crimes of rape; nor did it \u201cderail\u201d the #MeToo movement for parties who weren\u2019t already looking for an excuse to dismiss it.\n\nWe do not live in a society where published allegations of sexual assault alone ruin one\u2019s career. If it\u2019s any consolation for the Weisses and Flanagans of the world, they may simply look to the likes of R. Kelly and the current president of the United States for solace in how little such accusations hinder powerful men from thriving.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo date, Ansari\u2014much like most of the celebrities and industry insiders who have recently been accused of assault and misconduct\u2014has not been destroyed by modern-day, bloodthirsty-feminist witch hunts, excommunicated from human civilization or criminalized (pending police investigations into allegations involving Harvey Weinstein and Russell Simmons notwithstanding).\n\n\n\nGrace\u2019s account\u2014one that toggles between acquiescing to certain sexual acts and withdrawing from others\u2014is a pervasive experience. While many seem to direct their ire at Grace for her decisions and at Babe for its treatment of the story, few are expressing resentment toward the societal conditions that demand we present infallible victims with accounts of sexual abuse enshrouded in an impenetrable armor of credibility to even be taken seriously in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s time to be honest: We are a society\u2014a country especially\u2014that despises victims for having the audacity to \u201callow\u201d themselves to be victimized. When Grace describes her reaction to Ansari\u2019s advances\u2014\u201cI stopped moving my lips and went cold\u201d\u2014it was hard for me to imagine that many of us couldn\u2019t relate to that kind of dissociation. When she mentions taking a while to concede to the feeling that she\u2019d been violated, I understood her reluctance to arrive there.\n\n\n\nVictimhood is work. Acknowledging it, vocalizing it, deciding if it merits pressing charges, following through with seeking punitive recourse or any recourse, healing from it, moving on and preparing for the onslaught of interrogation from parties who are more than eager to discredit it\u2014it\u2019s arduous and painful work.\n\nThe choice to \u201cfight back\u201d when you are being pressured or overpowered during sexual interaction makes it all the more real that an assault is happening and could escalate, and the consequential stigma of victimhood all the more imminent. It\u2019s no wonder so many people resent it and try to deny their own proximity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFew sins are worse in America than being powerless. Many of us, especially those of us who may have already cobbled ourselves together after recovering from prior experiences with assault, would rather dissociate and delude ourselves into believing that our own experiences with sexual coercion were just \u201caggressive\u201d or \u201cawkward\u201d instances that we gave into\u2014to avoid having to add another instance of sexual assault to an already loaded plate of trauma.\n\nThe takeaway from Grace\u2019s anecdote isn\u2019t that we should consider every regrettable or uncomfortable sexual interaction as assault (though this anecdote described more than mere discomfort; remember, sexual assault encompasses more than rape). This isn\u2019t about bad sex. It\u2019s about examining how dysfunctional our sexual socialization is for us to read that instance and chalk it up to merely being a \u201cnormal\u201d and clumsy sexual experience. There should be nothing \u201cnormal\u201d about leaving a date in tears because you feel violated, and we shouldn\u2019t be so content and flippant with characterizing it as such.\n\n\n\nUltimately, this is an incident in which many truths can exist; we can acknowledge that it\u2019s probable Ansari\u2019s celebrity and his public persona played a part in Grace wanting to give Ansari a chance to redeem himself during that evening, and even desiring his kindness after he made her uncomfortable. It\u2019s just as probable that Ansari was fully aware of the leverage his celebrity granted him over a green young woman 10 years his junior who was visibly eager to go out on a date with a popular star.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also very likely that a man who has written a book about modern dating in which he elaborates on his habit of determining if a woman is uninterested in him simply by the tone and response time of her text messages is capable of gauging that a woman who recoils from his attempts of getting her to touch his dick for 30 minutes and verbally expresses that she doesn\u2019t \u201cwant to feel forced\u201d is probably not excited about having sex with him, and consent is not static.\n\nFurthermore, claims that men in general are unable to read nonverbal cues and that anything other than a clear \u201cno\u201d confuses them have been debunked in recent studies; researchers conclude (pdf) that men are, in fact, perfectly capable of reading and recognizing nonverbal cues from women who are resistant to sex. The problem isn\u2019t that they don\u2019t understand; they just don\u2019t like the answer.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s OK to feel unsure if what Grace described as the worst night of her life neatly matches with your understanding of assault. That discussion needs to be had if we are to have a rigorous examination of our sexual politics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, accusations of sexual abuse are not all going to look like scandalous, easy-to-condemn, jaw-dropping accounts of egregious brutality and predation, and alleged victims are not always going to behave in ways we understand. Nor should they have to for us to engage them responsibly.\n\nDisingenuous, lazy claims about the \u201cambiguity\u201d of both consent and resistance allow sexual assault to remain ubiquitous. If nothing else, we are a society that firmly believes in questioning the credibility of alleged victims with way more fervor than we do the actions of their alleged abusers.\n\nWe have ample leg room to, instead, fix our gaze on proper ways to handle the stories and best interest of people alleging sexual assault. We can also stand to focus a harsher lens on men like Ansari who pursue rigid sexual compliance in the face of resistance and to admonish their team of toxic acolytes who are more than eager to dismiss their harmfulness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we are to push forward conversations about sexual abuse and all of its variations, we need to be prepared to be uncomfortable, unsure and conflicted. It\u2019s not a precursor to anarchy or a disservice to the movement if we question what we have accepted to be normal and entertain the possibility that we have been harmed or may have also caused harm during the course of our sexual experiences.\n\nRest assured, we have not strayed that far from the status quo.

Think of what the press has done in the United States.\u201d\n\nAs an example, Ginsburg cited the Post\u2019s investigation in which reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein exposed the Watergate scandal that would lead to President Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat story might never have come out if we didn\u2019t have the free press that we do,\u201d Ginsburg said.

The first song on the album is called \u201cApple of My Eye.\u201d As I listened to this song for the first time, a very familiar voice, one I\u2019ve been listening to since I was 9 years old (I\u2019m currently 38), came booming through the system: that of Raphael Saadiq.\n\nThe man who told me in 1990 that it never rained in Southern California (absolutely not true\u2014it does rain, just not enough) and had me ready to \u201cdance tonight\u201d (every night) in 2000 is still showing up on albums in 2017 by one of the more famous rappers in the game. Still sounding crisp as ever; making music worth listening to.\n\n\n\nIt was at that moment I realized a simple fact: Raphael Saadiq might be the most underappreciated artist in music, but especially R&B. Ever.\n\nEver.\n\nI hear you looking at me; I\u2019m not crazy. Think about it. For real for real. Why do I say the most underappreciated? Simple. When was the last time you had a conversation about great artists and Raphael Saadiq\u2019s name came up? I\u2019ll wait. This despite the fact that he\u2019s not only been around for what feels like my entire life, but has been making music that I\u2019ve listened to during that entire span. Even his Wikipedia page is disrespectful; Ja Rule\u2019s page is more in-depth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTony! Toni! Ton\u00e9! dropped in 1988. Nobody really remembers that first album much, but in 1990, when the group came through with the second album, The Revival, we were all paying attention. \u201cFeels Good\u201d still jams, and if you tell me that you love the \u201990s and don\u2019t know the words to \u201cIt Never Rains (in Southern California),\u201d I will call you a lie and a cheat, Joe Jackson, and I don\u2019t want you.\n\nThe group brought us such classics as \u201cAnniversary,\u201d \u201cLay Your Head (on My Pillow),\u201d \u201cNo Loot,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s Get Down,\u201d \u201cThinkin\u2019 of You\u201d and \u201cJust Me and You,\u201d and you know that, especially given later successes, Raphael was at least driving 75 percent of the time on that road trip. House of Music? It\u2019s like butter, baby, and hinted, substantially, at where he\u2019d be going, especially with his solo works and D\u2019Angelo. Put a pin in D\u2019Angelo.\n\nDuring this time comes the real solo hammer: 1995\u2019s \u201cAsk of You\u201d from the Higher Learning soundtrack. Bruh. I ain\u2019t saying it\u2019s the most \u201990s song of all time\u2014or the best\u2014but this song made its way onto almost every \u201cYou My Boo\u201d mixtape back when those were actually cassette tapes. It is that dope a song. Not to mention, his harmonica game was on a hundred-thousand trillion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe years 1999 and 2000 were huge for Raphael and the culture. Along with Ali Shaheed Muhammad from A Tribe Called Quest and Dawn Robinson from En Vogue, Saadiq brought us Lucy Pearl, a group project that included the song \u201cDance Tonight\u201d but was, on its own merits, an album chock-full of dope jams and smooth riddims. I still rock this album\u2014front to back\u2014today. That was \u201999. In 2000 he helped D\u2019Angelo channel his vision for the song \u201cUntitled (How Does It Feel)\u201c from the Voodoo album, which led to \u201cthe video.\u201d Don\u2019t forget, though, Saadiq was a significant part of D\u2019Angelo\u2019s song \u201cLady\u201d from Brown Sugar.\n\nThus far, we\u2019ve got the three Tony/i/es, Lucy Pearl, D\u2019Angelo and solo recordings, all yielding magnificent results.\n\nBut 2002 is when the rubber hit the road, fam. He released his debut album (a solid 14 years after really hitting the scene) with the ABSOLUTE, INARGUABLY classic album Instant Vintage. From \u201cDoing What I Can\u201d to \u201cSkyy, Can You Feel Me,\u201d the entire album was one big-ass ride though musical perfection. If you have never heard this album, you absolutely should head to your nearest streaming service and listen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.\n\nLet\u2019s skip a little bit, seeing as how Saadiq\u2019s catalog includes production for a plethora of artists from Angie Stone to Erykah Badu to Bobby Valentino. But take a gander\u2014a goose, if you will\u2014to 2016, when Solange Knowles drops an album that had unicorns and gangstas alike looking for cranes in the sky, the relevantly titled A Seat at the Table. Saadiq was instrumental in helping Solange see through her vision to craft an album that was heralded and lauded by critics from all corners of the musical kingdom.\n\nEven after all of those musical contributions, Saadiq has garnered very few Grammy nods or wins (just one, I believe), and rarely is his name included in conversations about music\u2019s most important or significant figures. Largely, I think it\u2019s due to his vocal range, which isn\u2019t exemplary, though I am a big fan of his voice and vocal performances on recordings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe\u2019s a singer whose strength as a songwriter outshines his vocal abilities, even if he has one of the most distinctive voices in R&B ever. I can\u2019t think of any other reason why somebody who has worked with the range of artists he\u2019s worked with, who\u2019s created the body of work he\u2019s created and been able to successfully create music of different stylings across decades and eras, who has songs that are vital to the listening experience of a particularly strong decade of R&B, and who is responsible for some of the most compelling music of several artists\u2019 careers doesn\u2019t even have an episode of Unsung and might be, textbook, the most unsung black artist ever, considering his contributions.\n\nSaadiq deserves a seat at the table of R&B greats, and hopefully, he gets his due one day.\n\n", "keywords": ["underappreciated", "artist", "saadiq", "music", "artists", "solo", "yeah", "think", "raphael", "vocal", "rb", "song", "album"], "polarity": 0.17916984773982056, "subjectivity": 0.4882617322291236},

Adekoya was on hand Thursday to describe for listeners of the American program \u201cDemocracy Now!\u201d why Trump would choose Poland as the first stop on his tour. Trump said there that \u201cWestern civilization\u201d was at stake.\n\n\u201cPoland is one of the main countries which refused to take in any migrants during the 2015, 2016 migrant crisis in Europe, when suddenly a million refugees found themselves in Europe,\u201d Adekoya said. \u201cSo, this \u2014 so, the fact Trump made this speech in Poland is significant. He would not, most probably, have been able to make this kind of speech in Western Europe to the kind of reception which he did get in Poland, which was very positive. And like I said, supporters of this right-wing government were basically shouting, \u2018Donald Trump! Donald Trump!\u2019 throughout the speech.\u201d Many of those supporters were bused in, Adekoya said.\n\nHost Amy Goodman asked about his background. \u201cI was born in Nigeria, lived there for the first 17 years of my life,\u201d Adekoya replied. \u201cThen I moved to Poland in 1995 as a student and lived there for\u2014living there from since then, essentially. Now I shuttle between the U.K. and Poland. And, yes, that\u2019s it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen the changes in Poland. When I arrived in Poland, the country was just six years out of communism. There were very few foreigners in the country, as you can imagine, definitely very few black people.\n\n\u201cThings weren\u2019t always very pleasant. With time, things improved regarding the treatment of foreigners and treatment of black people. I mean, there was a time in the mid to late \u201890s when you could hardly walk on the street without hearing a racial insult hurled at you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut towards the early 2000s, some 10 years after the end of communism, and when Poland joined the EU finally in 2004, you know, the economy improved, and people\u2019s moods generally improved. Poles got a little bit more used to seeing foreigners on the streets. Those kind of, let\u2019s say, racial insults just hurled on the streets, just like that, stopped, and things improved vastly.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, since this government came back in, the current Polish government, in 2015, they used the migrant crisis of 2015. When there were a million refugees, essentially, within Europe\u2019s borders looking for where to go, they used that crisis to scare Poles into essentially making the argument that, \u2018Look, look at what is happening in France. Look at what is happening in countries like the U.K. They\u2019ve got terrorism there because of all these Muslims who are there. Do we want that? Obviously, we don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cSo, we can\u2019t allow them\u2014the EU, that is\u2014to push on us, you know, these migrant refugees, these Muslims, and tell us that we have to take care of them, because, essentially, well, maybe while not all Muslims might be terrorists, but some of them definitely are, so why take the risk?\u2019 . . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Adekoya told Journal-isms by email, his skin color proved to be a positive in his work as a journalist there.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, my skin colour worked to my advantage as a journalist in Poland. When I started covering parliament, it was often easier for me to get an interview with a top politician than for Polish journos. The politicians were simply curious about me as the only black journalist they\u2019d ever dealt with! I also got noticed more easily in general in the journalistic world. So it ended up being a plus :)\u201d\n\nMichael Ottey, an African American assignment editor on the foreign/national desk at the Los Angeles Times, has also remarked on Polish reactions to black people.

Johnson in reaction to the urban uprisings of the 1960s, also said, \u201cNews organizations must employ enough Negroes in positions of significant responsibility to establish an effective link to Negro actions and ideas and to meet legitimate employment expectations.\u201d\n\nThe report led to training programs for journalists of color and increased hiring. In 1978, ASNE set a goal of achieving parity in newsrooms with the percentage of people of color in the general population by 2000. Twenty years later, the goal was changed to 2025. The 2000 goal was not met, but \u201cdiversity\u201d is now part of industry language and outreach efforts continue. Ethnic diversity now also includes Hispanics, Asian Americans and Native Americans.\n\nJournal-isms asked readers for ideas on how to commemorate the anniversary, then suggested a discussion of the issue at the ASNE-APME-APPM convention in Washington in October.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe organizations have approved such a panel for 9:45 a.m. to 10:55 a.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 10. \u201cKerner Commission at 50: What did we get right?

Nearly all expressed disappointment with progress on diversity. Suggestions included an emphasis on integrating news industry leadership ranks, an idea that ASNE has embraced; collecting journalistic work of black and brown journalists; public conversations between veteran and younger journalists of color, more vigorously measuring diversity progress and, more fundamentally, simply implementing the commission\u2019s recommendations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Kerner Commission\u2019s Chapter 15, \u201cThe News Media and the Disorders,\u201d is here: http://bit.ly/2nb8mZr\n\nA brief summary is here: http://www.eisenhowerfoundation.org/docs/kerner.pdf (Go to Chapter 15.)\n\nAmerican Society of News Editors: ASNE Diversity History\n\nJournal-isms Inc.

Most recently it said it would report on social justice.\n\n\u201cWhen Univision bought Gawker (after the site filed for bankruptcy), it almost seemed like Fusion would serve as a place for some [of] its writers who didn\u2019t fit under the Gizmodo or Jezebel umbrellas.

Hyacinthe is one of the hardest-hustling creatives in New York City, crafting a hybrid career out of her two greatest passions: music and fashion. By day, the stylist and CEO of Immaculate Wardrobe dresses Fortune 500 female power brokers; by night, she\u2019s DJ Soda Pop, spinning hip-hop and house at Manhattan venues like the Museum of Sex\u2014where she launches a weekly residency tonight.\n\nThe Glow Up recently caught up with the busy Bronx-born beauty to discuss her parallel creative careers and her future as a fashion DJ. The product of what she describes as a traditional Haitian-American family, Hyacinthe grew up on a steady diet of hip-hop and haute couture, influenced by three older brothers and a style-obsessed stepsister. Her own obsession with fashion began so early, she recalls cutting out and stashing Vogue spreads under her pillowcase, just so she could wear the outfits in her dreams:\n\nI remember being in school\u2014we had to list our skills, what we were good at. And the only thing I [could] think of was that I can put clothes together nicely. ... And I remember picking up\u2014it was Vibe magazine\u2014and they used to have the fashion editorials, and I saw [celebrity fashion stylist] June Ambrose. And they had this article, and I remember it led with \u201cstyle architect,\u201d and I was just like, \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to do!\u201d She was a major inspiration. ... I just saw her, and I was like, \u201cThis is what I aspire to be.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, it was a mentoring program led by image activist Michaela angela Davis that would be the conduit for bringing Hyacinthe\u2019s aspirations to fruition\u2014and would teach her a powerful lesson in asking for what you want:\n\nIt all starts with Michaela; she was running something called Salon du Shine at her house, where there\u2019d be a group of, like, 10 of us girls [getting] together in her loft in Brooklyn. And we would just talk about stuff, you know. And I remember going up to Michaela, like, \u201cCan you introduce me to June Ambrose?\u201d And she was just like, \u201cI don\u2019t know ... June is super-busy.\u201d I kid you not: A couple of days later, Michaela calls me and she says, \u201cJune is looking for an intern.\u201d... So I went to the interview\u2014June\u2019s two assistants at the time, they tore me to pieces\u2014but I wound up getting the internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile interning for Ambrose, Hyacinthe also worked full time to put herself through the Fashion Merchandising Management program at New York City\u2019s Berkeley College. It was the beginning of a career path that her Haitian parents, unfortunately, didn\u2019t understand:\n\nMy parents\u2014although they were very loving\u2014they didn\u2019t understand the concept of me wanting to be a stylist and me being in a creative field; it was foreign to them. ... They didn\u2019t have the opportunity to dream as we do, and I think because of that, they\u2019re unable to\u2014they\u2019re in a sense blind to that. ... So I wound up having to put myself through college; I worked full time [in retail] and I did this internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorking for Ambrose taught Hyacinthe how the editorials she once obsessed over were created, but it was working in retail that helped her find her niche: helping busy professional women build their wardrobes.\n\nI would work with clients, and they\u2019d be like, \u201cSophia, I love working with you; you style me so well. I wish you could come dress me at home.\u201d And one day I actually got the courage to say, \u201cWell, I can.\u201d ... So this one client took me up on it, and I went to her house and started with her closet. But then she had me speak with her career coach, and that\u2019s when it really clicked: This is on another level. Like, you know, female executives really need this. And I really found the value that I could add.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIdentifying her core clientele and their unique need to possess a high-end wardrobe without having the time to curate or shop for it, Hyacinthe launched her company, Immaculate Wardrobe. The self-described \u201cwardrobe whisperer\u201d currently dresses about 20 clients, all of whom are powerful women who inspire her daily, as she explained:\n\n\n\nI work primarily with female boss bitches. These are women that are working [as] CEOs of companies, and they\u2019re also moms. ... I feel like it\u2019s really important for me to surround myself with these powerful women. And I feel like since they\u2019re at the top of their companies, not only am I empowering them, but also the women that come [into their companies] that\u2019ve just graduated from college ... to see that someone at the top of their career is not only killing it, but also killing it with style.\n\nBut while helping other women fulfill their potential, Hyacinthe also realized an opportunity to further fulfill her own. A longtime avid lover of music, she was often critical of DJs on the New York City nightclub scene. Challenged by an exasperated friend to learn for herself, she accepted his gift of a DJ class at New York\u2019s famed Rock & Soul record store. Instantly, another passion was born, along with an alter ego: DJ Soda Pop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike her styling career, Hyacinthe\u2019s growth as a DJ has been simultaneously organic and self-driven. She initially asked more-established DJs for opening slots and cultivated her own contacts and connections. It\u2019s a path that called into conflict the hip-hop-loving girl from New York\u2019s Bronx borough and the cultured style expert whom elite businesswomen entrust with their wardrobes:\n\n\n\nGrowing up in my family, I grew up listening to Reasonable Doubt, to Onyx, to Nas\u2014like, really hard music. Like, I\u2019m very feminine and girly now, but I grew up liking really hard-core rap. I\u2019ve always known that I\u2019ve had this love and passion for music, but it was, \u201cOK, Sophia, either you can pursue fashion styling or you can be a DJ.\u201d I didn\u2019t think in my mind\u2014I couldn\u2019t fathom the idea of me flourishing in both fields ... [But] to be honest with you, I can\u2019t exist with one without the other. ... I feel like they feed into each other so much, especially the route that I want to go. ... I want to be New York\u2019s new fashion DJ, and there\u2019s not enough of us brown girls up there that are actually doing it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile her dual careers may seem to be a study in contrasts, Hyacinthe approaches both spinning and styling instinctively, using unexpected textural combinations to evoke new feelings. And in the process of embracing her dual passions, her own identity fell into place.\n\nI feel like deejaying has really helped me fully come into my skin. ... Even with race: It\u2019s like before, I thought that I needed to kind of neglect my own identity to be accepted. And I know I\u2019m not the only one that feels that way; as a black woman in the fashion industry, which is predominantly white. I thought that I needed to strip some of my identity\u2014the fact that I listened to hip-hop, the fact that I loved it, the fact that I came from the Bronx\u2014I thought that I almost needed to move away from that in order for me to be seen in society as being this elegant person in fashion ... [but] I feel like once you accept yourself, they have no choice but to accept you for who you are. And I feel like deejaying has really allowed me to accept myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re in the New York City area, you can catch DJ Soda Pop every Thursday night at the Museum of Sex at 233 Fifth Ave. She launches her weekly residency Thursday night with a viewing party for RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race.", "keywords": ["fashion", "dressed", "double", "night", "really", "feel", "york", "inside", "career", "think", "hyacinthe", "sophia", "dj", "wardrobe", "women", "life", "dope"], "polarity": 0.16347579051383396, "subjectivity": 0.5693305335968378},

Booty songs. Shake jams. Butt bumpers. No matter what you call them, they all bring the same thing to the table: They put asses on the floor, both literally and figuratively.\n\nSongs dedicated to the derriere have long been a staple of the black community. My great uncle Jehosophat Rallo Jenkins Berkshire Jr. II once told me that he\u2019d heard (while working the chitlin circuit in celebration of his debut record, \u201cButt Cheeks Ain\u2019t Nothin\u2019 but a Good Time Masquerading as Child Support Payments,\u201d which, believe it or not, never charted) that before Robert Johnson allegedly sold his soul to the devil in exchange for musical greatness and success, he tried to sell his soul to a waitress in Biloxi because of dat ass.\n\nAs a card-carrying member of the Gluteus Maximi for the World Society\u2014a club built on humanity and core values of booty appreciation\u2014we annually discuss the intersection of kinetics, slow motion and music, and how to best shake that ass for peace, love and soul. It is in this endeavor that we rank booty shake jams. I\u2019m going to let you all in on our annual rankings\u2014for this year only\u2014to see where we landed on some jams whose sole purpose is putting asses in motion on the dance floor.\n\n[As a point of historical note, in December of last year, VSB\u2019s Damon Young pondered what the second-best booty song of all time was and listed a bunch of contenders but never ranked them. In a true sign of how important all of the songs listed are, this ranking was compiled BEFORE I even remembered the booty piece existed. Most of the songs he included made this list. That means these songs are hard science now.]\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. \u201cBaby Got Back\u201d by Sir Mix-a-Lot\n\nOut of respect for the first to really put asses on the map, this song enters the rankings. Sure, you will never actually hear this at a club where black people congregate, and it\u2019s more likely to be in a set that includes Vanilla Ice and Blink-182, but before the song was co-opted (and ensured Mix a tremendous payday), it was the song that displayed the true appreciation for asses\u2014plus, it\u2019s probably the only video that features a rapper dancing atop a fake ass that would make Jim Henson proud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. \u201cPop That\u201d by French Montana, Drake, Rick Ross, Lil Wayne\n\nThis song is so hype you can\u2019t help but getting to gyratin\u2019. Plus it contains a sample of one of the greatest booty songs of all time, which means that of course it would end up as one of the best. Plus it includes, for me, one of Drake\u2019s funnest verses ever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. \u201cNo Hands\u201d by Waka Flocka Flame, Roscoe Dash, Wale\n\nAll that ass, in them jeans. Probably also features Wale\u2019s most memorable verse ever. With that slow-plodding beat and hook, strippers everywhere showed us how it was done, and dance floor savants were happy to point out, \u201clook ma, no hands.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. \u201cBandz A Make Her Dance\u201d by Juicy J, 2 Chainz, Lil Wayne\n\nNo lie, the most explicit non-stripper dance I\u2019ve ever seen in my life happened to this song at a club in D.C. This woman had an actual audience of men and women watching, didn\u2019t care and proceeded to earn the respect and admiration of all who bore witness. I promise I\u2019m not making this up; people shook her hand after she stopped. Respect due.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. \u201cShake Ya Ass\u201d by Mystikal\n\nIf you don\u2019t watch yourself and show people what you\u2019re working with while listening to this song, then you\u2019re doing it wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. \u201cRump Shaker\u201d by Wreckx-n-Effect\n\nKids nowadays have no idea about the wonderousness that was \u201cRump Shaker,\u201d featuring a video that was taboo for its time (though today there are church congregations featuring less clothes than the participants of said video), but \u201cRump Shaker\u201d was everything, and everything was \u201cRump Shaker.\u201d To the rump. Yes, all I do wanna do is zooma zoom zoom zoom. It\u2019s really the only way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cI Wanna Rock (Doo Doo Brown)\u201d by Luke\n\nDon\u2019t stop, pop that *CENSORED*, let me see you Doo Doo Brown. Those words (the whole lyric sheet really) should be handed into the National Archives for permanent commemoration next to the Declaration of Independence for their unapologetic desire to move butts. I know it\u2019s not couth to call an ass jam perfect, but the BPM is way up, the call and response is explicitly ideal for anybody 18+ and the cardio workout potential is unparalleled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \u201cGet Low\u201d by Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz, Ying Yang Twins\n\nWhen it\u2019s all said and done, Lil Jon will be heralded as a prime purveyor of the pop. His whole catalog is perfectly suited for putting that ass on the floor. \u201cGet Low\u201d is a crown jewel of booty usage, especially because of the Ying Yang Twins, in that it\u2019s instructional, educational, great for exercise and ultimately is about teaching the youth the difference between windows and walls, filling a tremendous gap in public education.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cDa Butt\u201d by E.U.\n\nOne of only two songs guaranteed to ensure a rush of emotions and asses to the floor. Do you have to have a big ol\u2019 butt in order to do da butt? No, you do not. You just have to be willing to shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake and able to do \u201cda butt\u201d until it makes you sore. Yeah.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. \u201cBack That Azz Up\u201d by Juvenile\n\nTo quote Damon, from way back yonder: \u201cBut the best booty song ever, undoubtedly and undisputedly, is \u2018Back That Azz Up.\u2019 There\u2019s no question, no debate, no argument, no discussion. If I titled this \u2018What\u2019s The Best Booty Song Of All-Time\u2019 instead, it would be resolved in five words. \u2018Back That Azz Up\u2019 and \u2018Duh.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the \u201999 to infinity ... and beyond.", "keywords": ["best", "butt", "ass", "booty", "shake", "songs", "shaker", "rump", "ranked", "lil", "song", "floor"], "polarity": 0.21381578947368415, "subjectivity": 0.49908625730994144},

Be ready. Your Facebook cousins ended 2017 in grand style with an argument about rings, which they will surely resurrect. An alleged Kay Jewelers ad for a $24.99 engagement ring had married and single women debating if wanting a more expensive ring made them gold diggers or not.\n\nSo before they reprise their battle royal, I want to talk about why we all should let women get engaged without telling them to lower their demands\u2014for rings or anything else.\n\n\n\nThe internet refers to women as a \u201cpick me\u201d when they seem to bend over backward to accommodate potential mates. Women with obsequious opinions on relationships aren\u2019t necessarily jockeying for a man to notice them. Sure, they might be annoying at times, but I keep my complexion clear by remembering there is someone for everyone. I simply am not here for telling other women how low they must go to find love. As bad as a \u201cpick me\u201d can look, it has nothing on a woman boasting about how cheaply she got picked for.\n\nI find it tacky when married women tell single women how their love didn\u2019t cost a thing and expect their unmarried counterparts to follow suit. Sis, I admire your struggle love, really, I do. But that doesn\u2019t have to be every woman\u2019s narrative.\n\nTheir stories try to convey that the quality of the ring doesn\u2019t determine the quality of the relationship. I applaud that. Collectively, however, the overwhelming message turns into: \u201cHe picked me for less, and you should ask for less, too.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it\u2019s OK if some women want a ring that costs more than a Popeyes chicken bucket. But single women who dare express this truth hear two ugly lies about themselves:\n\n1. \u201cWomen are more concerned about the engagement ring than the marriage.\u201d\n\nHow important is a ring, anyway?\n\nWe aren\u2019t all going to agree on the answer to that question. And you know what? That\u2019s perfectly fine. You can point out that the popularity of the diamond engagement ring is the result of marketing\u2014and you would be right. If you start to unravel many traditions behind weddings, they are often rooted in misogyny or money, not romance. It is a saving grace that wedding rituals evolved over time to signify something beautiful. We fall in love with the symbolism and create our own reasons as to why it matters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA ring is merely one symbol in a social rite full of symbols: changing one\u2019s name, walking down the aisle, jumping the broom, breaking the glass. Neither the ceremony nor the traditions surrounding weddings hold much import in the actual marriage.\n\nThis is why I do not understand the vitriol and \u201cgold digger\u201d labels reserved for women who value the ring as a token of affection. It is asinine to castigate other women for adhering to one expendable nuptial custom when you probably have your own.\n\nMost women aren\u2019t more concerned about engagement rings than about their (impending or imagined) marriages. Arguments that women who give thought to their rings are \u201cfocusing on the wrong thing\u201d present a false binary. You can ask for the ring you prefer and put a lot of care into your marital relationship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cWomen should be so happy to receive a proposal; they should accept anything.\u201d\n\nFirst of all, I see a proposal as the introduction to a lifetime of partnership and work, not an honorific. Marriage is not a validation that women should be thankful to receive. But I saw one message from a woman scolding others: \u201cSomebody actually wanted you! Sit down! Be humble!\u201d\n\nI have a serious problem with people telling black women that they should be grateful anyone proposes to them at all. Black women are often cast as undesirable in the American imagination. It works a raw nerve to hear us tell one another that we are unworthy of material or emotional good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInasmuch as we should all express gratitude for finding love in this world, it\u2019s another thing entirely to consider a proposal as a charity. \u201cBeggars can\u2019t be choosers\u201d doesn\u2019t apply here.\n\nFurthermore, a ring is a gift you\u2019re expected to wear day in and day out. What is so reprehensible about trying to find a ring a woman likes? Can we even apply the rule that \u201cit\u2019s the thought that counts\u201d if the gift reflects thoughtlessness? Any token offered without the recipient in mind is a bribe for a compliment.\n\nMost women are not arguing that a man they truly love should go bankrupt on a ring. Women want to feel consideration, and they want a ring they don\u2019t hate. If the issue is affordability, and a woman inflexibly demands something her beau can\u2019t afford, that couple has bigger fish to fry than carats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut were we really arguing over $25 rings ... or something else?\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t believe a conversation about \u201cungrateful\u201d women and cheap engagement rings is actually about rings at all. The unspoken contention is that (black) women are not allowed to have a floor, a preference, a bare minimum, a shred of a standard in their own love story. We are expected not to find someone who would willingly be what we desire and require, but to ask for little and be overjoyed at just enough. And apparently, \u201ctoo much\u201d is a ring over $25.\n\nThis Valentine\u2019s Day, don\u2019t be that married person lecturing singles about how your beau had nothing to offer but his undying love and twin bed. I know you gladly accepted an engagement ring fished out of a Cracker Jack box. Yes, we know your 20-year marriage is going strong, even though it didn\u2019t start out with the Rock of Gibraltar on your finger. Your examples show us that true love can thrive with less.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut love is just as beautiful when it finds us worthy of what we ask for, even if it\u2019s more.", "keywords": ["ring", "worse", "rings", "pick", "engagement", "ask", "day", "bragging", "picked", "thing", "women", "telling", "woman", "love"], "polarity": 0.1393052079933268, "subjectivity": 0.5276680690047028},

One particular quote that expressed a sentiment I was ... expecting, to tell the truth, stood out. It was from entertainment attorney Mark Simon: \u201cThere may be a concern in this zero tolerance climate that creativity and creative opportunity could be restrained because individuals may become unwilling to put themselves in situations that could be misinterpreted or misconstrued in the creative process.\u201d\n\n*Rubs temples.* OK ...\n\nThe skittishness surrounding whether or not films can be produced with sex scenes really reeks of cishet men whining about, \u201cCAN WE EVEN COMPLIMENT Y\u2019ALL EVER??

Novel idea!!\n\nAnyone who has ever been on a set knows that producing sex scenes is, in fact, not sexy. The blaring set lights are searing into the actors\u2019 skin as they try to remember their blocking while simultaneously attempting to ignore the critical gaze of the director, cinematographer, production assistants, grips, gaffers and a partridge in a pear tree. Very, very awkward and\u2014I repeat\u2014not sexy. However, it is up to the director to create a safe space that elicits the most vulnerable and impassioned portrayals from their actors. It\u2019s not only good for the product; it\u2019s good for the person.\n\nEven as someone fully ingrained in climbing the ladder toward Hollywood success, I still can\u2019t wrap my head around the idea that my priority should be concern for whether creativity will be stifled, just because masculinity is that fucking fragile. When I think about the #MeToo movement, I don\u2019t think about whether or not Hollywood will continue to be \u201csexy.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think about a female former co-worker who was subject to advances to join a high-level attorney in his hotel room during a corporate holiday party. I think about Danielle Young\u2019s strained smile standing next to Jesse Jackson, an image that has been etched into my brain forever, especially because I recognize it.\n\nI think about the woman who chose to be nice to a passerby on the street who endlessly flirted with her and followed her home, and who had to grapple with the fact that if she had chosen to be \u201cstandoffish and cold,\u201d it could\u2019ve cost her her life. I think about the little girl who first noticed her hips and thighs because an old man creepily grunted under his breath while peering through her pants. And I think about how I have to look at that girl in the mirror every day.\n\nEliminating or avoiding sex culture in Hollywood is only placing a Sexy Snoopy Band-Aid on the issue. What is the action plan here? Make only G-rated films until the trendiness of #MeToo dies down? Extreme reactions like the quote from the attorney above are why I become cynical regarding everyone\u2019s dedication to the true betterment of our society. We all know that the real work begins when we have to actually reinforce a healthy sex culture. Don\u2019t worry; we can keep the sexy. Sexy ain\u2019t the issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, I happen to think that consent is sexy as fuck. Hell, let\u2019s level that up: Enthusiastic consent is sexy as fuck.

With a Republican majority in the Senate, he will be able to select the most conservative candidate possible, and he will be assured that his nominee will be confirmed.\n\nAlthough Trump still has a little over two months before he takes office, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans have made it clear that President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee, Chief Circuit Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Merrick Garland, will not be put through the confirmation process. Obama nominated Garland in March; the obstruction tactics blocking his confirmation have lasted nearly eight months.\n\nWhat this means is that in addition to whoever replaces Scalia, Trump could add a total of four seats to the highest court in the nation, giving it a conservative majority, if Justices Anthony Kennedy, 80, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 83, or Stephen Breyer, 78, were to leave the court.\n\nWe should all be worried about what lies ahead with the Supreme Court as well as a Republican-controlled Congress that can be expected to do much of Trump\u2019s bidding.

Blige\u2019s glow up this awards season; in fact, we\u2019re not sure we\u2019ve stanned this hard for her since What\u2019s the 411? The singer and actress has been nominated for Golden Globe, Critics Choice and Screen Actors Guild awards, and now a history-making two Oscar nods for both her performance and original song in Dee Rees\u2019 Mudbound. And she has stunned us on every single red carpet.\n\nBut those stunning looks have a secret weapon in a longtime member of Blige\u2019s team: celebrity makeup artist D\u2019Andre Michael. Knowing how much we wanted the 411 on Blige\u2019s super-fly SAG Awards look, Michael let The Glow Up in on a surprisingly low-priced secret: He exclusively used products from Black Opal.\n\nYes, THAT Black Opal (its Instagram is kind of poppin\u2019, by the way). In Michael\u2019s words:\n\nI\u2019ve been working with Mary J. Blige for years, and I love trying new looks on her. I wanted to create a showstopping look using Black Opal for her first-time appearance at the SAG Awards. Once I saw her gown, I knew I wanted to transform her into an elegant smoked goddess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was smokin\u2019 indeed, styled by fashion fave Law Roach in a one-shouldered black-and-white gown with a dramatic wing motif by designer Jean-Louis Sabaji.\n\nMichael, who\u2019s been on Blige\u2019s team for over a decade, complemented her dress and sleek modern hairstyle with a perfect smoky eye atop glowing skin, using Black Opal all the way. He shared with The Glow Up why, after years of working with the superstar, this awards season is such a special one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up: As a longtime member of Mary J. Blige\u2019s team, what\u2019s it like to work with her during this groundbreaking phase of her career?\n\nD\u2019Andre Michael: Having been with Mary J. Blige now for 11 years, we are more like family. I am so proud and honored to be a part of this moment with her. I\u2019m happy and overjoyed with her continued success, but this is like the stepping-stone to something I know she has been passionate [about]. It\u2019s amazing to see the acknowledgment and praise she is receiving for her work as an actress. I\u2019m like a proud brother.\n\nTGU: Mary\u2019s looks have been phenomenal at every event. How are you able to keep her looks so fresh?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDM: I have been with her every step of the way: Every award show, every red carpet, press junket, television show, etc. It\u2019s always been my thing to make her look good every time.\n\nMaybe because she\u2019s on a different platform now, a broader audience is taking note, but nothing has changed much with what we do. It\u2019s being there as a support for her in all that she\u2019s going through personally, making sure her spirits are up and she feels good about herself and comfortable with how she looks, what she\u2019s wearing, etc. So I think what shines through mostly is her \u201chappy\u201d\u2014and when you feel good internally, it shows externally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: You used exclusively Black Opal for Mary\u2019s SAG Awards look. Tell us why we should be checking for drugstore brands, and why Black Opal works so well for our tones?\n\nDM: I have never been one to follow trends or fads, mainly because trends come and go, and fads fade away. However, staying true to myself as an artist and finding things that work for me to use on my clients is most important. That\u2019s above any brand\u2014whether it is department store, drugstore or specialty store.\n\nI have learned just because something has a name brand on it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s suitable for what I need to use it for. Therefore, it is all about the quality of a product, and sometimes the most expensive product isn\u2019t necessarily the best. A lot of my favorite go-to products are drugstore brands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy friend Sam Fine worked with Black Opal years ago and helped them with their colors and palettes. Even then, I realized It was a brand that I could trust, because he\u2019s an amazing artist that I respect and call a friend. So if Sam trusts them, I know I can.\n\nDM: Black Opal has always been a staple for having a great color range for women of color; from the fairest of women to the darkest, you could trust you are in good hands with the Black Opal brand, and the formula is great. It gives great coverage that you could work with, whether you need a light coverage to a complete coverage. The Black Opal True Color Skin Perfecting Stick Foundation is amazing! It is great to see they are still around and providing women of color and us professionals with great colors and a great formula.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: At 47, Mary looks incredible. Can you talk about how makeup differs for women in her age group?\n\nDM: The only difference is probably the fads and trends you may want to stay away from with a more mature woman. In terms of looks, you definitely want to use less powder and more products that enhance a dewier look.\n\nFor eyes, most to all women can carry a smoky eye. Many think \u201csmoky eye,\u201d and they think black or dark. But you can smoke your eyes with almost any color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn terms of skin, I like to do my concealer, then apply my foundation, next set with a powder, and maybe spritz your face with a mister or the Evian mist spray to infuse the powder and foundation. Next, let it air-dry to take away the powdered look so you have more of a dewy skin appearance.\n\nIlluminators work as well, but know that sometimes these can come across drab and chalky looking if you use the wrong color. For women of color, I recommend an illuminator in the flesh-tone range (bronzy or mauve, etc.), and stay away from pearl color or yellows or orange-based colors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, even after all that great advice, we couldn\u2019t let Michael go without getting his step-by-step for creating Blige\u2019s SAG look, and all the products he used. How else are we going to plan for our next shopping trip?\n\nFor the Face\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the Eyes\n\nTo sculpt and define Blige\u2019s eyes, Michael used the Black Opal Aurora Eyeshadow Palette. First, he used the Brazen Copper shade on her entire eyelid. Next, he added Brazen Bronze on her crease, adding the Bordeaux Beige shade along the brow bone as a highlight.\n\n\n\nMichael then finished the eye look with Black Opal Color Splurge Automatic Eye Lining Pencil in Licorice, adding it along the lash line and inner lid and smudging to create a smoky look. Note: This eye pencil is formulated with aloe vera and chamomile extracts that help to soothe the delicate eye area as you define it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Lasting Lip\n\nFor the finishing touches to Blige\u2019s look, Michael used Black Opal Lip Color Splurge Stick Lip in Purr, a soft, pale-pink color enriched with emollient butters and vitamins C&E. This lipstick provides a bright, pigment-rich color that provides a smooth, creamy, nondrying finish.\n\nNo word yet on what Blige\u2019s look will be for the 90th Academy Awards on March 4. But even after Michael works his magic, we know the finishing touch will really be Mary J. Blige\u2019s happiness.

Another executive explained that the tagline was \u2018too closely associated with Roger.\u2019 Fox executives have been instructed by management to market the network by its other tagline: \u2018Most Watched.

(It would be like the New York Times giving up \u2018All the News That\u2019s Fit to Print.\u2019) Ailes invented the slogan when he launched the network in 1996, and over the years it became a quasi-religious doctrine among Fox\u2019s anchors and viewers. The effectiveness of Fox News as a vehicle for conservative ideology depended on it. \u2018If you come out and you try to do right-wing news, you\u2019re gonna die.

The way that the right-wing network covered the deaths of police officers in 2014 is a case in point.\n\n\u201c \u2018The politicization surrounding the killing of two New York Police Department officers over the weekend was amazingly swift. Fox News led the right-wing media charge, immediately claiming Democratic elected officials were somehow responsible for the gun rampage\u2026 ,\u2019 the MediaMatters analysis observed.\n\n\u201c \u2018On Fox, hosts and guests were sure who was to blame for the tragedy; not the gunman necessarily, but political and community leaders like President Obama, Attorney General Eric Holder, Mayor Bill de Blasio and MSNBC\u2019s Al Sharpton. Why? Because the men, to varying degrees, have spoken out about the troubled relationship between law enforcement and the black community, and raised concerns about two recent high-profile cases, Michael Brown and Eric Garner, in which unarmed black men were killed, and police officers responsible were not indicted.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSherman also wrote, \u201cIn the annals of modern advertising, \u2018Fair & Balanced\u2019 will be considered a classic.

The multidimensional author of A Beautiful Work in Progress has been making her way around the internet\u2014and on the pavement.\n\nRecently, she was featured in a J.C. Penney campaign with yogi Jessamyn Stanley as well as in a now-viral video with REI, where she reads an ugly email from an anonymous troll who accuses her of not being a runner because she\u2019s overweight. As director of equity and inclusion at Rabun Gap Nacoochee School, the Mirnavator\u2014a pseudonym to almost 30,000 Instagram followers\u2014wears many hats: Spanish instructor, cross-country coach and even, utilizing her Juilliard background, a chorus director; that is, when she\u2019s not beating down the trails or doing a Tough Mudder.\n\n\n\nFor those unfamiliar with her story, Valerio has consistently defied the stereotypes of what an ultrarunner looks like, while being featured by the Wall Street Journal, Runner\u2019s World, NBC Nightly News and CNN.\n\nMany have questioned if she can truly be both \u201cfat and fit\u201d while tackling courses like the Javelina Jundred and the TransRockies Run\u2014a whopping 62.13 and 120 miles, respectively. As she recounts in her book, her passion for fitness dates to her youth; but it was ultimately a health scare that gave her the jump start back into running.\n\n\u201cI was driving through the middle of Pennsylvania when I started getting chest pains, and thought I was having a heart attack,\u201d Valerio told HuffPost in October.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThankfully, it was a false alarm, but she followed up with a cardiologist who advised her to change her lifestyle or else she would die, leaving behind her son. During this period of her life, she was working around the clock, under high stress, with no relief, and not exercising. Her health scare pushed her to begin documenting her running journey with the public, sharing everything from her experiences of night running to talking about her fitness endeavors as a plus-size woman sometimes coming in DFL\u2014\u201ddead fucking last\u201d\u2014at trail races.\n\nAs a fellow runner and friend, I\u2019ve had the pleasure of celebrating an annual New Year\u2019s Day hike at Anthony\u2019s Nose with Valerio. This year, I couldn\u2019t help but ask a multitude of questions, wondering what sparked her to write her memoirs while also trying to balance her private life, teaching, training for the Boston Marathon and touring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cActually, there is no balance; it\u2019s sort of a myth,\u201d she joked.\n\nThe boarding school where she works has been exceptionally accommodating to her ever-changing schedule, allowing her to maintain employment on a flexible schedule\u2014and allowing her teenage son to stay on campus while she tours several states.\n\nAlthough flattered by the media attention, she says she wanted to tell her own story of how she started her journey. So, since her October 2017 book launch, Merrell and REI have teamed up to help Valerio conduct a multicity sold-out book tour, allowing her to engage with thousands of people from Seattle to New York City.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdmittedly, amid the the waves of support from fans praising her astonishing accolades, she\u2019s consistently had to remind herself about self-care:\n\nWhen I was on the Rich Roll podcast, I had to put my phone down, because all day, I was getting a ton of messages and DMs on Instagram, on Twitter and all of my Facebook pages.\n\nTypically, it\u2019s questions like \u201cWow, how did you get started?\u201d But the Merrell, Skirt Sports and Swiftwick Socks ambassador noted that there are times the questions get tough. Although she strives to answer every message, she hopes that living in her truth will serve as an unspoken example for others to pursue their passions despite shape, size, disability or background:\n\nIt\u2019s cool knowing that people reach out and share themselves in that way; it may sound crass or caustic, but I cannot solve everyone\u2019s problems. I hope that through seeing and observing me through my social media accounts that they do receive the inspiration that they need to get out of whatever hold that they\u2019re in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer ambitious calendar is currently loaded with events such as a 50K with the North Face Endurance in Washington, D.C.; a 10K the following day; a host of Tough Mudders; and traveling to the Azores Island to do a trail run.\n\nLike many, I wondered if there were any other books in her future. Although there are no confirmations yet, she hinted that she will be involved in several major projects that will touch on running and beyond.\n\nSo what advice does a motivational speaker and accomplished runner offer to those who want to get themselves started in fitness?\n\nWrite down your goals first. Speak them out to the universe, and then create a plan. If you want to start running or start weightlifting, write it down. Make sure that goal is actually achievable; you should have a SMART goal or plan. Break up your goals into smaller ones. Temper your schedule accordingly, and then work towards each goal without overwhelming yourself with the bigger goals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, I personally suggest creating and sticking your vision board somewhere visible, like on your refrigerator; actually look at it. Be patient with your body. Stop retraumatizing yourself with negative stories.\n\nJust like when you tell yourself something positive while practicing self-love and care, negative thoughts work the same, in the opposite way. When you continue being overcritical of yourself, it retraumatizes you and may even change your DNA.

This could very well swing the court in either the direction of liberal and progressive or extreme conservatism.\n\nOf particular relevance are cases that impact police powers. Historically, members of law enforcement have been given wide latitude with respect to how they execute their jobs because society has largely afforded them the benefit of the doubt, given the inherent danger associated with their jobs. But recent events have eroded that argument and raised the question of whether we should continue to give cops such unabridged discretion.\n\nWe have borne witness to myriad examples of abuse of power by police against communities of color, and the courts have only been but so helpful in protecting our rights amid a broken criminal-justice system. For every case like Kingsley v. Hendrickson (which held that intent wasn\u2019t necessary when proving police force was excessive), there seems to be two rulings on the opposite end of the spectrum, like Luna v. Mullinex (which expands immunity for killer cops) and City of San Francisco v. Sheehan (in which the court ruled that police officers who killed a mentally ill woman could not be sued).\n\nThe following are four cases, decided by the Supreme Court, that police regularly rely on to cross the line when it comes to an individual's rights:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis case is widely considered the original standard for \u201cstop and frisk.\u201d In it, the court essentially decided that police could lawfully stop and search a person without violating his Fourth Amendment rights against unlawful search and seizure, so long as the police were able to articulate a reasonable suspicion that a crime had occurred or was about to take place.\n\nAt the time, Terry was a decision that, while it broadened police authority, did not seem to give cops carte blanche. However, with time, we now know differently. As we learned in Floyd et al. v. City of New York, police (to no surprise to anyone black) have for decades made \u201cblack and Latino\u201d synonymous with \u201creasonable suspicion,\u201d effectively making the threat of blackness a real thing that can be used to make unreasonable stops and searches routine.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know all of those episodes of Law & Order where there is literally 3:14 left before the credits roll, and they have the prime suspect in for questioning and lie to him about a confession from an accomplice the police never really had? And then the person snaps and confesses in a fit of rage after thinking he was betrayed? Yeah, that all comes from the Frazier case. Every time.\n\nWhen police have a basic amount of information that allows them to make certain deductions, they are allowed to, within certain limits, extrapolate, or lie, to a suspect about having other confessions or eyewitnesses. If this results in a confession, the confession can be used against the defendant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lesson here? As always, leave the conversations with police to your attorney.\n\n\n\nIn this case, a defendant voluntarily went into a police station \u201cfor questioning\u201d and was told that he was not under arrest. While he was talking with police, the cops lied to the defendant and told him they had recovered his fingerprints from the scene of the crime (they hadn't). The defendant confessed to having taken property and was subsequently arrested.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Supreme Court decided that defendant Mathiason had not been unreasonably coerced and that police had not abused their power. That's right. The cops lied, got a confession and then used that confession to make an arrest when they otherwise would not have had probable cause to do so or enough evidence to get a conviction.\n\n\n\nWhile the other cases mentioned above are at least 35 years old, this one holds particular relevance to the technology of the present day. Essentially, police can lawfully, unwittingly and unintentionally, get you to provide them with a sample of your DNA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, if a cop offers you a beverage and you accept, they can use any DNA sample they recover to determine whether there is a positive match to other DNA found at a crime scene and, ultimately, use it to convict you. Police can also lawfully secure DNA by searching through your garbage without permission.\n\nIt's obvious that most of these cases are old. It wouldn't be unreasonable to suggest that when they were originally decided, the way mainstream America looked at race and policing was significantly different from now. Well, maybe not significantly different, but there certainly weren't body cams or cellphone cams or any of the other technologies that have been used to help support legitimate accounts of repeated abuses of authority by police against people of color.\n\nThere are a number of solutions to these rulings. New cases can be brought that might have a chance to overturn them, little by little. The long-term takeaway from Floyd, for example, was that where a systemic pattern of racism has been found (see the Justice Department reports on Baltimore, Cleveland and Ferguson, Mo.), there is stronger justification for not allowing police to use certain tactics like stop and frisk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe other possible solution to addressing some of this antiquated case law is to elect officials who are committed to enacting legislation that severely penalizes law-enforcement officers who wantonly disregard their responsibilities and violate the public trust through their actions. But overall, in an era where police abuses of civil liberties seem to run rampant, and the Supreme Court is likely to have multiple vacancies in the foreseeable future, it's critical to understand exactly how much is truly at stake in the upcoming presidential election.\n\nCharles F.

Our ultramodern, minimalist office space\u2014although filled with laughter and camaraderie\u2014drops to meat-locker-level temps when the mercury dips. Not to mention, we\u2019re passionate about beauty.\n\nOur latest outing was to an afternoon with Unilever, the parent company of popular brands Degree, TRESemm\u00e9, SheaMoisture, Suave, Nexxus, Axe, Dove and more\u2014and yes, we\u2019re still asking pointed questions about Dove\u2019s racially questionable dustup last year; we\u2019ll circle back on that conversation when we get answers.\n\nIn a carnival-like atmosphere that was part sideshow and part science, aestheticians demonstrated product while scientists explained the molecular get-down of Unilever\u2019s newest products for face, hair and body.\n\nDid you know that every seven seconds you shower, you use enough water to fill a bottle of wine? I had no idea that much clean water gets used up that fast, mostly while we\u2019re trying to rinse conditioner out of our hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnter Love, Beauty and Planet, a new line of hair and skin-care products engineered to rinse completely clean in half the time of regular conditioners and washes, while ensuring that nothing goes to waste. Most of us don\u2019t know that bottles with labels that are not easily removable are ineligible for recycling and get tossed into garbage dumps; Love, Beauty and Planet\u2019s labels meet this requirement and are 100 percent post-consumer material.\n\nAnd what\u2019s in the bottle? All goodness, with argan and coconut oil formulas and delicious scents. Though you can\u2019t drink them, the idea behind this line is that it\u2019s \u201cfast and fabulous,\u201d carbon neutral, rinses clean quickly and aids in saving 20 percent more water every shower.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDove, well, what can we say? Many of us grew up using its products, and though the company admittedly messed up on that last campaign, some good may have came out of it. Esi Eggleston Bracey, an African-American exec whose hustle and glow over the past decade have made her one of the most powerful in her field, joined Unilever in January as executive vice president and chief operating officer of the company\u2019s North American personal-care business.\n\nIt\u2019s important that we have a seat at the table, not only for gatekeeping our image but, most important, for opening the gates of opportunity when it comes to mentoring and recruiting women of color at the C-suite level of corporate America.\n\nThat said, Dove has both new product and an inclusive, new campaign for DermaSeries, created to treat severely dry skin conditions, including eczema and psoriasis. Ashy folks everywhere, get ready to leave dry skin in the dust; the formulations include rich, hypoallergenic balms that glide on and give an instant glow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs someone who intermittently suffers from eczema, the caring philosophy behind the launch of DermaSeries speaks to the truth that severe skin conditions can rule your life, determining everything from what clothes you can tolerate wearing against your skin to where you\u2019ll go socially because of \u201cgood-skin privilege,\u201d to being able to let someone touch you\u2014even to shake hands or give you a pat on the back. It can be a lot. The women in the campaign\u2014all nonmodels\u2014address conditions that affect 1 in 4 Americans at some point in their lives.\n\n\u201cHi! Want to make a meme?\u201d was the question that came from an unlikely presenter\u2014no more than 15 years old\u2014who made up half of the duo behind the Generation Z consulting firm J\u00fcv. Currently lending their talents to the campaign for Axe body spray, these kids were there to guide us through the feel-good points of the brand\u2019s latest advertising initiative, working in partnership with singer John Legend, among others, to help redefine what it means to be a man, and to help clear the air of toxic ideas about masculinity that have existed in our culture for eons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, wait; Axe is gender-fluid now?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo ... something like that,\u201d the kid answered, before asking if I knew what memes were. Umm, yeah. I do.\n\nFrom a nearby table stocked with props, I put on my carnival disguise of heart-shaped glasses and fuzzy antennas, and the kid directed me to make a happy face, \u201clike you\u2019re ready for prom in January.\u201d While the marketing exec\u2014who looked like a character from The Big Bang Theory\u2014was snapping away pics on the phone for Insta-stories, I got the spiel for Axe Gold\u2019s kinder, gentler version of masculinity.\n\nThis version encourages men to find their magic ... though I don\u2019t know if #ManMagic will become a thing, like #BlackGirlMagic (I checked\u2014it\u2019s not). It also asks the question, \u201cIs it OK for guys to ... cry, be skinny or be the little spoon?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a \u201cMan Box\u201d study Unilever commissioned from global firm Promundo, the statistics tell a compelling story: When young men feel pressure to conform to negative stereotypes, it often leads to unhealthy behavior\u201481 percent turn to bullying, 71 percent to sexual harassment, and 51 percent experience depression.\n\nThe social-change campaign Senior Orientation was created around John Legend and Axe to demonstrate how delving into your creative side can be a way to escape a host of unhealthy behaviors. Legend told Forbes why he joined the campaign, and shared his thoughts on traditional definitions of masculinity:\n\n\n\nIt can be limiting because it\u2019s all based on stereotypes and dated notions of what men are expected to do in society and the truth is men come in all kinds of varieties and their roles are different depending on who they are, how they were raised and what they want to do in life. We need to allow the space for them to be creative and to be an individual and not be overly constrained by what tradition says men are supposed to do. It can be very limiting to both to men and women to assign these roles, and Axe is tapping that for men, given that it\u2019s their target audience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho knew all that was going on in a can of body spray? Here at The Glow Up, we love talking about beauty as a means of both expression and empowerment\u2014from luxury-level tech innovations at a drugstore price to black female executives on the rise\u2014and, certainly, our men\u2019s armpits exuding the sweet smell of a safe space.

Nudity doesn\u2019t have to be sexual.\u2019 If we asked questions or hesitated, we were the ones making it weird,\u201d Kim added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe women said that once they were lured into the hot tub, Vereen asked them personal questions.\n\n\u201cHe was acting as my mentor, asking me about my parents; then that same night, he put me on his lap while I was crying, and I felt his erection,\u201d Terpstra recalled.\n\n\u201cHe asked me, \u2018Feel that?\u2019 It was terrifying. I said, \u2018Feel what?\u2019 I wanted to act like I didn\u2019t. I pushed myself off with a laugh. Then later, he asked, \u2018Do you think I want to fuck you?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yes,\u2019 and he got angry. He said, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t, and that\u2019s unfortunate.\u2019 He made me feel like I had my mind in the gutter.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKim said that while she was in the hot tub with Vereen, things went even further after he asked her to perform oral sex and left her feeling \u201cconfused.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just think at the time, I didn\u2019t feel like I had a choice. I didn\u2019t want to do it, but I was intimidated and scared. He was being very intense and angry. He seemed very angry and offended. I had seen him behave this way toward others in the tribe during circle,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI just felt powerless because I thought I really needed his help and guidance. And when he said nudity doesn\u2019t have to be sexual, I was like, \u2018OK, maybe this isn\u2019t even sexual,\u2019\u201d Kim added. \u201cNow I understand it was a power play. It was so calculated. It was like we were putty in his hands.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Daily News notes:\n\nIn his statement, Vereen said he gained new perspective on his behavior in the last two years. \u201cWhile it was my intention to create an environment that replicated the themes of that musical during the rehearsal process, I have since come to understand that it is my conduct, not my intentions, which are relevant here. So I am not going to make any excuses because the only thing that matters here is acknowledging and apologizing for the effects of my conduct on the lives of these women,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing forward, my having come to terms with my past conduct will inform all my future interactions not only with women, but with all individuals. I hope these women will find it in their hearts to accept my sincere apology and forgive me,\u201d his statement read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKim acknowledged that she eventually became involved in a relationship with Vereen, saying that she told herself it was more spiritual than sexual.\n\nAnother actress, Ariella Pizarro, accused Vereen of pressing himself against her one night as he hugged her goodbye, before later texting her, \u201cYo (sic) felt so good tonight.\u201d\n\nFrom the Daily News:\n\nThe News obtained a copy of the text message sent by Vereen and confirmed the number was listed in his name. Pizarro said Vereen also randomly kissed her on the lips in the first few weeks of rehearsals, when she was 22 years old. \u201cWe were in a music rehearsal, and he was just walking around, and then he walked up and kissed me on the lips. It was so weird. We all knew Hair was going to be a different kind of production, like in the \u201960s, but he didn\u2019t even ask first. He just kissed me. I was shocked, for sure,\u201d Pizarro said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t shove his tongue down my throat, but it gave me an uneasy feeling. Then he moved on. I didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom that point on, I kept myself at arm\u2019s length with Ben.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCast members also recalled an uncomfortable moment when they had to strip for a rehearsal exercise and Vereen decided he would get naked, too.\n\n\u201cIt was uncomfortable, to say the least,\u201d Pizarro noted.\n\nAs for Venice Theatre, which was supposed to be watching out for these young women, officials said they only became fully aware of the extent of the allegations after Terpstra posted on Facebook about the experience back in November.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe theater reached out to every member of the Hair cast, getting in contact with all but six of the 32 individuals.\n\n\u201cWe have learned recently that during our 2015 production of Hair, more than one female cast member was asked to join Mr. Vereen at his residence. Some of those visits resulted in compromising situations for at least two of the actresses,\u201d Executive Director Murray Chase said in a statement. \u201cWe are working to strengthen our sexual harassment policies and procedures, including the reporting of them, to prevent any future occurrences.\u201d\n\nThat being said, Terpstra said that Chase had to step in during one particularly volatile confrontation with Vereen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Daily News reports:\n\nTerpstra said she\u2019s not sure exactly what she told [Chase], but she thinks she mentioned at least one forced kiss. She said Chase later sat in on the final dress rehearsal, but Vereen was not banned from the building. Chase told the News he remembered the hallway incident but thought it was isolated. \u201cWhile we were aware of an altercation between Ben Vereen and Ms. Terpstra, we have now learned of additional situations,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth Terpstra and Kim said that the experience with Vereen had lasting effects on their careers, with neither having acted in a production since, although both have stayed in the creative fields, with Terpstra going toward burlesque, while Kim returned to a job at the Venice Theatre to \u201credefine that space.\u201d", "keywords": ["hair", "ben", "didnt", "asked", "sexual", "sexually", "feel", "star", "women", "daily", "broadway", "young", "terpstra", "vereen", "actresses", "production", "assaulting"], "polarity": 0.029034894398530763, "subjectivity": 0.4628856749311295},

Some great moments deserve a sequel, and we\u2019ve therefore done some deep investigative journalism to get the details on our favorite look of Grammy night 2018.\n\nAs previously posted, Eve was our hands-down winner of this year\u2019s awards ceremony, despite not being nominated this year (sorry, Beyonc\u00e9). Thanks to our intrepid, talented and well-connected Gizmodo Media Group family (we\u2019re talking about you, Victor Amos!), we were able to get the scoop on Eve\u2019s incredible Grammys style\u2014and, most important, how to imitate it.\n\nLet\u2019s start with that gorgeous face: Makeup artist Ernesto Casillas has been working with Eve since the promotional tour for Barbershop and counts her among his favorite clients. For her Grammys look, he rose to the occasion while not even knowing what the star would be wearing, as he tells The Glow Up:\n\nFor the look, I knew right away that I wanted to keep it pretty and somewhat classic. We didn\u2019t know exactly what outfit she was going to wear up until right before she went on, so I wanted to keep the colors neutral and paint her in a way that she would feel confident and pretty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe multihyphenate added \u201cred-carpet host\u201d to her title this year, co-hosting the evening\u2019s Grammy Red Carpet Live with Entertainment Tonight\u2019s Nancy O\u2019Dell, Kevin Frazier and Keltie Knight. To make sure the star stayed stellar-looking throughout the day, Casillas had a strategy:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCasillas also wanted to make sure the focus stayed where it belonged while his star was speaking on the red carpet:\n\nEve usually likes to opt for a nude pink lip, but I knew I wanted a midtone lip, since she was wearing a suit and would be interviewing people. I wanted the mouth to also be a focus, but not too dark, either. I lined the lips with a deep berry color and filled in with a lighter, peachier shade. I used Kat Von D\u2019s \u201cLolita\u201d lipstick and some nude gloss over that.\n\nAnd lest we forget that Eve opted to wear not one, but two d\u00e9colletage-baring blazers during the evening, Casillas certainly didn\u2019t, using Gleam Body Bronzing Lotion in shade Deep Gold on her chest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as for that mane of perfectly tousled waves Eve was rocking over her shoulder? You can thank hairstylist Angela Christine, who\u2019s been working with Eve for over seven years and also styles her for The Talk. Christine tells The Glow Up:\n\nShe\u2019s an amazing person to work with, [and] really makes the job easy. Eve loves strong and effortless, so once she chose the suit, she wanted something that felt relaxed and beautiful at the same time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that deciding on Eve\u2019s style was effortless; Christine was ready for a big chop, but the star felt otherwise. \u201cWe actually went back and forth about the hair. ... I wanted to do a shorter, edgy cut, but she was serious about keeping it long,\u201d Christine says.\n\nAnd as for that color? Christine says that she and Eve have been playing with both warm and cool tones lately, and the honey tone was actually done well in advance. The extensions actually came from Christine\u2019s own line, Conscious Curls, in a texture called Strength, which closely resembles natural hair blown out. \u201cThis [allowed] for lots of fullness and volume, which we both loved,\u201d Christine says.\n\nChristine then used a medium-barrel ceramic curling iron to achieve those gorgeous loose waves, strategically curling in opposite directions for a messier look. She then used Ouai Rose Oil and Kenra Texturizing Taffy to create even more separation and texture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristine\u2014who, in addition to working for The Talk, also has a salon in West Hollywood, Calif., and consults for other beauty brands\u2014is releasing a series of affirming children\u2019s books called the Pretty Curls Club.

Let\u2019s look at this past week alone: the Russian scandal that is now consuming his own family; the indecipherable tweeting in the wee hours of the morning; his ongoing assault on women\u2019s rights with a plan that will allow employers to deny contraceptive coverage. The past six months of this administration have been a hot pile of garbage, and I imagine that four years from now, this song will still apply.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cPortland,\u201d by Drake\n\nWhile the president got all hot and bothered about Kathy Griffin\u2019s ill-advised attempt at humor involving a photograph, it took him three days to call out actual violence perpetrated by a white supremacist who killed two men who were defending a couple of teenagers against his anti-Muslim rant on a Portland, Ore., train. These kinds of attacks, particularly against black men in Maryland, California and New York City, are the latest form of domestic terrorism that can be directly traced back to the racist rhetoric of the president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \u201cIn America,\u201d by John Legend\n\nLet\u2019s pour one out for Underground, the hit slave drama that was canceled after WGN America\u2019s parent company was acquired by Sinclair Broadcast Group, which wants to create a new Fox News.

Sydney Caesar, a junior high schooler in Texas, had her blackness questioned when she was given the horrific award of \u201cMost Likely to Blend in With White People.\u201d White supremacy, in all forms subtle and horrible (see No. 2), is that gift that generations keep regifting to the next.\n\n\n\n5. \u201cBitch Better Have My Money,\u201d by Rihanna\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is for all the freelancers whom Ebony has yet to pay for work rendered.

She was strong, tall, elegant, gracious, and I saw myself in her. I cried because her beauty was the same type of beauty that I have. It was a relief to see her being celebrated. For many decades in the United States, I was not considered pretty. I was strange. They thought my skin was too dark. My arms and legs were very large.\n\nEvery year, 16 Afro-Brazilian women compete to become the Queen of Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea, an Afro-Bloco carnival group in Salvador, Brazil, that promotes black pride and Afro-Brazilian culture in Brazil. Afro-Brazilians in the neighborhood of Liberdade started Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea in 1975 in resistance to Salvador\u2019s carnival, which at the time excluded blacks. The group derives its heritage from Candombl\u00e9, an Afro-Brazilian religion traditionally led by women. Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea has traditionally been a carnival group for dark-skinned black people in Salvador, and the contestants of the Beleza Negra pageant represent this aesthetic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe goal of the Beleza Negra is to represent black women in a way that Brazilian and international media fail to\u2014as strong, spirit-filled and divine. Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea\u2019s theme this year was \u201c100 Years of Madiba: Nelson Mandela\u201d; contestants represented this in their dresses. The winner of the pageant will now reign as the Queen of Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea\u2019s carnival, and her responsibilities include representing the Afro-Bloco in and outside Brazil, as well as dancing in carnival during the group\u2019s parade.\n\n\u201cThe Goddess of Ebony contest is a validation of representation,\u201d Neal, 35, told a Brazilian newspaper. \u201cIt is very much needed here, [and] all over the world. To me, it says, \u2018I am here, I am valid, I exist, I have a proud history, I have beautiful cultural narratives and I am not alone.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeal traveled back to Salvador to prepare and compete, thanks to a fundraising campaign she started once she learned that Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea had accepted her application for the pageant. On the day she arrived, she went straight from the airport to her first practice with the other contestants, who ranged in age from 18 to their 40s. All but four came from Salvador.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was dropping a kitten in a bunny cage,\u201d said Neal, who is a director, filmmaker, photographer and writer. \u201cThe other contestants didn\u2019t quite know what to make of me. They didn\u2019t know if I was a novelty or serious competitor. I was fatigued, sweating, and my eyes were bloodshot from all the travel.\u201d\n\nShe made waves in Salvador and was featured on the front page of the local newspaper. The local population supported her participation in the pageant, which has traditionally been seen as a way to promote black women from local communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think that the overall impact has been positive,\u201d said Adrian Erik McCray, a longtime African-American expat in Salvador. \u201cThe fact that an African American\u2014\u2018an elite,\u2019 in the eyes of Brazil\u2014chose to participate in something that revives the resistance spirit of Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea is something positive.\u201d\n\nOnce settled in Salvador, Neal scrambled desperately to find someone who could create the two required dresses\u2014one representing Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea and another representing a deity. She then learned a special dance that\u2014more so than beauty\u2014defines the Ebony Goddess.\n\nNeal found a savior in 27-year-old Cec\u00edlia Cadile, an entrepreneur who placed third in last year\u2019s Beleza Negra. Cadile\u2019s involvement in the pageant dates back to when she was a teenager, when her sister competed in the pageant. In the two weeks before the pageant, Cadile worked as Neal\u2019s coach, teaching her the special Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea dance and helping to prepare her two dresses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a already precious stone, and she only needed someone to help bring out the shine in her,\u201d Cadile said.\n\nContestants pose with last year\u2019s Deusa de \u00c9bano, Gisele Santos Soares.

Neal had already developed an intimate relationship with Afro-Brazilian culture and music through her participation in a Brazilian drumming group in the U.S., but she did not grow up with the rhythms and dances of Candombl\u00e9, a handicap she overcame within two weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese women have been doing this all of their lives as part of their experience in Candomble,\u201d Neal said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t born in Candombl\u00e9.\u201d\n\nWhen the moment came for her to perform her dance, Neal put her heart, soul and even stomach into it:\n\nRight before I was about to go on, we were standing in a narrow, one-window hallway backstage, and it was really uncomfortable. I was hot, I was breathless, I was dizzy, I needed to sit down, I needed to stand up. I needed to eat something, I needed to throw up ... all these contradictions! I perform and I\u2019m fine. As soon as I get offstage, I\u2019m sick again. I can\u2019t breathe, I\u2019m hot, I\u2019m sleepy, I\u2019m awake ... then I\u2019m fine. I go to where I can see the rest of the contestants, and as they come offstage to the holding area, they\u2019re all going through the same or similar feelings as I am: hot, breathless, crying, shaking.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeal didn\u2019t win the contest. The new Deusa de Ebano is J\u00e9ssica Almeida Nascimento dos Santos, 19, who hails from the Cabula neighborhood in Salvador.\n\n\u201cI felt like I did what I came to do and was satisfied,\u201d Neal said. \u201cI didn\u2019t win, obviously, but I feel emotionally amazing.\u201d", "keywords": ["beauty", "il\u00ea", "queen", "needed", "im", "ebony", "competed", "aiy\u00ea", "afrobrazilian", "goddess", "pageant", "salvador", "women", "neal", "contestants", "woman", "africanamerican"], "polarity": 0.10597478544846965, "subjectivity": 0.4534500075947444},

However, for the sake of credibility, it needs to be said that I am a jazz and blues snob with an affinity for bebop\u2019s challenge to the white normativity.\n\n\n\nOh, and another thing.

If you\u2019re still willing to hear what I have to say, then in no particular order, I will give you a total of 20 reasons that 1997 was an incredible year for black music.\n\n\n\n1. The Notorious B.I.G.\u2019s Life After Death\n\nBiggie\u2019s second and final studio album was released in March 1997. It gave us both \u201cMo Money Mo Problems\u201d and, perhaps his most radio-friendly single, \u201cHypnotize.\u201d A self-conscious continuation of the themes explored in Ready to Die, this album delves into the psychological complexity of a life trapped in what Frantz Fanon calls the \u201cfact of blackness.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Puff Daddy and the Family\u2019s No Way Out\n\nThis album is, admittedly, uneven\u2014but it still bangs \u2026 hard. It\u2019s Puff at his peak \u201cUh-huh, yeah\u201d-ness, but songs like \u201cAll About the Benjamins\u201d and \u201cBeen Around the World\u201d can get still get the party going, while \u201cI\u2019ll Be Missing You\u201d will cause you to lament the untimely death of one of our most brilliant wordsmiths.\n\n\n\n3. Missy Elliott\u2019s Supa Dupa Fly\n\nIn July 1997, Miss Misdemeanor took the world by storm with her playful, inventive melding of hip-hop and R&B. It is inexcusable that she still does not really get more acclaim for her singing, songwriting, lyricism and visual creativity. Supa Dupa Fly was a masterpiece of absurdity. It gave us \u201cThe Rain,\u201d \u201cHit Em Wit da Hee,\u201d \u201cSock It 2 Me\u201d and the underappreciated \u201cPass da Blunt.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Erykah Badu\u2019s Baduizm and Live\n\nIn 1997 we were introduced to Baduizm and the album Live, wherein we were informed that we needed to call Tyrone and tell him to come on, but were disallowed from using Ms. Badu\u2019s phone.\n\n\n\nBadu represents a shift toward and a popularization of feministic Afrofuturism in music. She is not the first to embody this, but her embrace of sexuality and an Afrocentric political aesthetic was, for many people, revelatory.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Toni Braxton\u2019s \u201cUn-Break My Heart\u201d\n\nWhile released in late 1996, this song owned the first two months of 1997. Toni Braxton shaving a young Tyson Beckford was on virtually every screen for the first 60 days of that year. The song is a velvety-smooth, dark-chocolate ballad with infinite replayability. (BTW, what the hell was with Beckford lazily doing kung fu in silk pajamas in front of the house? That scene, to this day, makes no damn sense, but I miss the overly dramatic videos of the \u201990s. Aaron Hall\u2019s \u201cI Miss You\u201d is a masterpiece of the genre.)\n\n\n\n6. \u201cStomp,\u201d by Kirk Franklin and God\u2019s Property\n\nOne cannot overstate how huge this song\u2014released in late 1996 off an album that dropped in May 1997\u2014became. This is what turned the 5-feet-5 urban gospel star into a national sensation. Having the audacity to sample Funkadelic\u2019s One Nation Under a Groove, Kirk Franklin wrote a song that literally changed the course of gospel music. I remember going to a club and being amazed to see thugs sporting cornrows and the fake-platinum chains one would buy from a mall pop-up two-stepping to his take on hip-hop-inspired gospel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Boyz II Men\u2019s \u201cA Song for Mama\u201d\n\nThe official song for funerals of black grandmothers, big mamas and Madeas was released in 1997. (The official song for the funerals of black fathers and grandfathers was released six years later when Luther released \u201cDance With My Father.\u201d) To this day, I cannot hear this song without shedding thug tears.\n\n\n\n8. R. Kelly\u2019s \u201cI Believe I Can Fly\u201d\n\nOK. Let me say this from jump: I hate R. Kelly\u2014but this song was a monster of a hit. Released in late 1996, this thing was omnipresent in 1997. It was probably also the song that began the trend of black secular songs being sung in sacred spaces. This was the song that paved the way for something like Alicia Keys\u2019 \u201cIf I Ain\u2019t Got You\u201d to be sung in churches with the small addition of \u201cJesus\u201d at the end of the chorus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Janet Jackson\u2019s The Velvet Rope\n\nThis, to me, is Ms. Jackson\u2019s best album. (She told me to call her that because I\u2019m nasty.)\n\n\n\nBut I\u2019ll let Janetologist Son of Baldwin tell you why:\n\n\n\nAside from it being Janet\u2019s most vulnerable, introspective work, it was also her most experimental. She did a lot of interesting things with her vocals (the croak on \u201cYou,\u201d the whimper on \u201cGot \u2019Til It\u2019s Gone,\u201d the honey harmonies on \u201cI Get Lonely\u201d). She tackled queer antagonism (\u201cFree Xone\u201d) and domestic abuse (\u201cWhat About\u201d). And, along with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, she predicted the sexual/human-interaction pathologies that would rise with the digital age, in what is probably one of the greatest (and most underrated) songs ever written (\u201cEmpty\u201d). The album was a masterpiece, ahead of its time, so black that it was blue, and horrifically overlooked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYeah \u2026 what he said.\n\n\n\n10. The Love Jones soundtrack\n\nI cannot believe it\u2019s been 20 years since Darius Lovehall did \u201cA Blues for Nina.\u201d The film holds a special place in my heart, but the soundtrack was just as magisterial. \u201cHopeless\u201d by Dionne Farris, \u201cThe Sweetest Thing\u201d and \u201cI Got a Love Jones for You\u201d by the Refugee Camp All Stars are the standouts, but I defy anyone to find a bad song on the soundtrack.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s 10 reasons why 1997 is, if not the best year for black music, certainly my favorite. Let me give you a few honorable mentions.\n\n\n\n11. \u201cKissing You,\u201d by Des\u2019ree\n\nThis underappreciated ballad dropped in July 1997. Although only a piano and string instruments accompany Des\u2019ree\u2019s voice, the song never loses emotional momentum. Her vocalizations are at once heart-wrenching and transformative. Beyonc\u00e9 covered the song in 2007, but the original is the only version I acknowledge.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n12. In My Life and Times, Vol. 1, by Jay Z\n\nThis album showed us that Hov could be both a rapper with street cred and a rapper with bankability. This marks the beginning of his ascendance into greatness.\n\n\n\n13. \u201cLove Always,\u201d by K-Ci & JoJo\n\nThey were the only reason Jodeci was worth a damn, and upon striking out on their own, they gave us a peek into their softer side. If you attended a wedding of a black couple between the years 1998 and 1999, you probably heard this song at some point during the reception.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n14. LSG, by LSG\n\nThis is probably the album that began the grown-and-sexy movement. Not soon thereafter, \u201cwhite parties\u201d populated by black bodies began to happen on boats and in places serving brown liquor all across the nation.\n\n\n\n15. When Disaster Strikes, by Busta Rhymes\n\n\u201cDangerous,\u201d \u201cPut Your Hands Where My Eyes Can See\u201d and the underappreciated \u201cThe Body Rock.\u201d Enough said.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n16. My Way, by Usher\n\nThis album goes hard. Remember \u201cNice & Slow,\u201d \u201cSlow Jam,\u201d \u201cMy Way\u201d and \u201cYou Make Me Wanna \u2026 \u201d?\n\n\n\n17. Next\u2019s \u201cToo Close\u201d\n\nI had no idea what this song was about until I was good and grown, but the campy lyrics are infectious.

It is a dangerous, albeit relatable, thought for many people who have experienced romantic love. Although I will not commit this thought to action, it tells me that toxic things are taking place in both my environment and the dynamic of my relationship. Thoughts are intangible, but they are far from inconsequential. It is thoughts that create presidencies and sustain toxic cultures.\n\nKeith Boykin recently wrote an article titled \u201cIn Defense of Lust\u201d as a response to an article by writer Darnell Moore titled \u201cThe Bodies of Others Are Not Mine.\u201d\n\nMoore wrote poetically about fundamental feminist truths around queer men and our objectification of one another. Moore interrogates his own habits when interacting with other men and invites gay men to do the same for themselves. The idea of his essay was to push and queer the conversation around rape culture past the heteronormative lens through which we\u2019ve been looking at it ever since the Hollywood sex scandals around Harvey Weinstein penetrated the public consciousness.\n\nBoykin\u2019s article challenges Moore\u2019s and states the case that thoughts can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be policed\u2014that as long as no action is being committed, there is no offense to apologize for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a post-The Secret world, it was surprising to read words, especially from a writer, that attempted to declaw the power of thought. Boykin writes: \u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental distinction between thought and behavior, and this is what concerns me most about policing our imagination. Sexual misconduct is a serious societal problem that deserves the attention of men of all sexual orientations, but in our effort to eradicate sexual assault and rape culture, we need not rid ourselves of desire and lust.\u201d\n\nThought and behavior do not live separately; in fact, they depend on each other. Thoughts create behavior. And behaviors, practiced enough, create environments and culture.\n\nInside of spaces for queer men, patriarchal thoughts are accepted\u2014thoughts like the fantasies void of consent, like what Boykins wrote about Moore: \u201cI turn him toward the tree and enter him from behind, holding his neck down for balance and dominance.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not just a fantasy detailing an erotic wish; this is a fantasy detailing assault\u2014shared publicly with an alarming lack of awareness of how its publishing alone could make its subject uncomfortable or unsafe.\n\nPatriarchal behavior is constantly excused and often fetishized. There are countless articles demonstrating how stereotypical toxic masculine behavior, which includes everything from exhibiting violent behaviors when mad to touching people with no consent, is preferred by a large portion of gay men. Because of this, a patriarchal culture and environment are created. And one of the symptoms of this patriarchal environment is rape culture. This is the culture that made Boykin think that expressing his more-toxic fantasies was a just rebuttal to an article about queerness and objectification.\n\nMy second thought when reading Boykin\u2019s article was how people\u2014especially those who claim a radical queer or gay politic\u2014must elevate the conversation around desire, lust and the erotic. Whom you lust over and how you lust and how you express desire for another man is not created in a vacuum; it is informed by everything you\u2019ve experienced up until that lustful moment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Moore was pushing us to think about with his article is what informs these \u201crandom\u201d moments of dehumanizing someone who has the same gender, sexuality and race experience as oneself.\n\nMoments where black men can\u2019t engage with other black men beyond their body, face or sexuality disturb me because it reminds me of the narrative of black men\u2019s history in America. It reminds me that even between two black men, the physical appraisal of someone takes priority over a type of intellectual or nonsexual emotional engagement with each other.\n\nIt reminds me of the auction block, where black people were mules being looked over. It reminds me of the rape and castration of black men and the narrative that the sum of black men\u2019s worth is in their sexuality, their labor and their usefulness inside of the white supremacist patriarchy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, your wet dream fantasy is not harmless. It strips black men of humanity and instead demonizes and eroticizes them beyond recognition.\n\nFinally, there was a total lack of any kind of analysis on power. As I read the cases against Harvey Weinstein as well as Bill Cosby, one common thread I found was their power to change environments\u2014to turn professional spaces into sexual ones. To transform friendly outings into dangerous, predatory moments.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that before a Cosby places a drug inside a martini, or before a Weinstein pulls his dick out of his pants, a sexual, erotic fantasy often occurs that involves the rapist in power and the victim submitting. They act on that fantasy and quickly change the environment from a safe moment to a dangerous, predatory moment. One\u2019s ability to do that as a man still exists, even if the one being pursued is another man. That is something to agitate, interrogate and\u2014perhaps\u2014even police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven inside my own experiences with rape, sexual assault, harassment and molestation, it is clear that the untamed male imagination is what activated those violent moments in my life. I know transgender people who were killed because of a cisgender man\u2019s untamed imagination and his shame around it. From experience, I have undergone rape and assault because of closeted, masculine men\u2019s untamed imaginations.\n\nThe imagination is something to take seriously. Writers and intellectuals especially should know this, since so much of our work is rooted in the imagination and our ability to capture that of the public.\n\nMy boyfriend is alive, but in those toxic moments when I thought about harm and violence, I thought about what else was lurking. I found that a struggle for power and an insecurity informed by patriarchal standards lived in our relationship dynamic, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a way, Boykin is correct: Thoughts and the imagination are not things to be policed, but they are something to be examined, and in some cases, they hold hints to where the soul needs healing.

Like, I\u2019m sure we all could go on and on about how terrible this year truly was to each and every last one of us. Still, the year had some high points, which we pointed out earlier this week, but in the spirit of balance and equilibrium (it took me all that I had to not make a Star Wars crack, since I finally went to go see The Last Jedi), I think reflection on the super, terrible year that was 2017 is necessary, even if that means reflecting on its low points for us as a people.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nSo, without further ado, I present to you the top 10 disappointing moments (in no particular order) black people experienced in the year 2017:\n\n\n\n1. White People\n\nThis ... is a given. In 2017, perhaps the greatest moments of discomfort, borderline instability and downright asininity experienced by our large and expansive community could be most certainly traced back to Chet and them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom President Cheeto Dandruff yucking it up in the White House and threatening to start a war every time he tweeted with his sausage fingers to white people trying to install a whole (alleged) child molester in another political office in Alabama to chanting about \u201cwhite lives\u201d in Charlottesville, Va., with their busted tiki torches, white folx showed no sign of waking the fuck up and instead continued to plead that we save them from themselves.\n\n2. The Atlanta Falcons Giving Up a 25-Point Lead in the Super Bowl\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Jan. 22, 2017, it was announced that the Atlanta Falcons would face off against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl 51. And after President Radioactive Cheeto Dust was elected to office at the conclusion of 2016, it became quite clear that this aforementioned game was about to become an unintentional, extended metaphor for that year.\n\nIndeed, it was the ultrablack, ultralit Falcons versus Trump\u2019s America the New England Patriots and Tom \u201cTrump Is My Boi\u201d Brady. And for a minute, during that very game, it looked as if the Falcons were gonna take the win, with a 25-point lead to boot.\n\n... and then they blew that lead to lose to Trump\u2019s America the Patriots by six points.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was one of the most embarrassing Ls we took this year, and to be quite honest, I\u2019ll never get over it.\n\n3. The Cancellation of Underground\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am honestly still too angry to describe how unjust it was that Underground was canceled but shows like, oh, I don\u2019t know, Megyn Kelly Today are still chilling on the air.\n\nIt was an unnecessary loss of a show that focused on aspects of black liberation during slavery rather than the kind of torture porn that Hollywood is used to peddling. The cancellation was especially hard to swallow when it was announced that HBO had its own alternate-universe slavery fan fiction in development (thankfully, that looks like it\u2019s no longer happening).\n\nHowever, despite its unjust cancellation, the search for a new home network for Underground continues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Alexandra Shipp, Tinashe and Colorism\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColorism. It is a subset of oppression that precedes your existence and mine. And yet, to this day, black people can\u2019t seem to get ourselves together when it comes to this topic. Such was the case this year as well.\n\nTinashe was the earliest example as she implied that being light-skinned had hurt her odds of succeeding in the music industry, even though she had not done anything remarkable as of late, and she simultaneously failed to call out the over-saturation of stars who look like her in the business, thereby causing her lamentations to fall on deaf ears.\n\nAlexandra Shipp was just another example of this when, a couple of weeks ago, the actress claimed that black people had been the most racist to her for her entire life. This was after a Storm superfan came into her Twitter mentions about hoping that Marvel would cast a dark-skinned Storm for a hypothetical X-Men franchise reboot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot everyone agreed with how the fan approached the ever present problem of characters like Storm being portrayed by light-skinned actresses, but I think most of us can agree that the actress (a word I use lightly) took the conversation in a direction that didn\u2019t even make any damn sense.\n\nAnd in 2017, we should be able to do better.\n\n5. Russell Simmons Proved How Tight Sexual Predators Can Be\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2017 was a shit year, no doubt, but it also proved to be, for the most part, a year of reckoning for men who had done some dirt in the dark. The domino effect started with Harvey Weinstein, and folks are still out here in these streets being rightfully exposed. And Russell Simmons was among those in the carnage.\n\nAfter Terry Crews came forward about being sexually assaulted by WME\u2019s Adam Venit (a moment that was very, very important for male survivors), Crews also was very candid about the folx who had tried to silence him and, in turn, exposed Simmons\u2019 damning email to Crews in which he attempted to tell Crews to \u201clet it go.\u201d It was a disgusting development, and no one was surprised when Simmons was subsequently accused of sexual assault, too. However, folx who were familiar with Simmons\u2019 Rush Card scams and Kimora Lee\u2019s stories about him knew that this was part of an already trifling pattern of behavior.\n\n6. The Fallout from VerySmartBrothas\u2019 \u201cStraight Black Men Are the White People of Black People\u201d Piece\n\nThe moment I saw the headline \u201cStraight Black Men Are the White People of Black People\u201d come across my timeline, I knew that all hell was about to break loose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nI\u2019m not gonna get into the specifics of the piece (mostly because you can read it here), but Damon Young\u2019s article got at a point that cisgender straight men had been ignoring for a long time: that they are the most privileged in our community.\n\nOf course, it wasn\u2019t as easy to refute coming from a fellow cis, straight black man, so many of Young\u2019s detractors, in turn, went after prominent black women who had shared the article\u2014the chief example being Jemele Hill, who they had all fake supported weeks prior. It was an ever present example of the kind of hypocritical bullshit black women are confronted with every damn day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Time: The Kalief Browder Story Reminds Us of Everyone We\u2019ve Lost to an Unjust Justice System\n\nOn Oct. 6, 2016, it was announced that Jay-Z and his team were putting together a documentary about the life, times, and completely unnecessary and avoidable death of Kalief Browder. The documentary finally debuted this year, and while it was something we sorely needed, it was also a painful reminder of all the black people we had lost thus far to an unjust \u201cjustice system.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt also served as a harrowing admonisher of the effects that racism and white supremacy can have on our bodies and minds, too, which we were reminded of after his mother\u2019s (Venida Browder) untimely death last year and Erica Garner\u2019s recent hospitalization.\n\n8. Black Transgender Model Munroe Bergdorf Called Out Racism and Was Fired by L\u2019Oreal\n\nIn a year full of watershed moments when women snatched back the mic from a society that constantly seeks to silence us, it was particularly angering when Munroe Bergdorf did just that and was punished for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, L\u2019Oreal was all for profiting off her image as a black trans woman and her ties to those respective communities, but as soon as she attempted to speak on behalf of them, L\u2019Oreal was like, \u201cNah.\u201d Combine this with instances like Jemele Hill\u2019s, and it\u2019s another example of these corporations wanting \u201cdiversity\u201d without teeth. Performative nonsense.\n\n9. That Racist Dove Commercial\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s be real. Since the goal of any sensible corporation or business is to make a boatload of cold, hard, stinking cash (hello, capitalism), no one is expecting them to be super-\u201cwoke,\u201d empathetic entities.\n\nHowever.\n\nIn the spirit of getting as much money as fucking possible, you would think they could at least appeal to the most common denominator of their demographics and have people on deck to make sure they are not racially insulting a huge chunk of their base.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019d think.\n\nBut this year, that was not the case with Dove. Dove made it excruciatingly obvious that it has no black people in its public relations/marketing department when it released a commercial that showed a dark-skinned black woman taking off a brown shirt and morphing into a white woman.\n\nTo be forthcoming, it wasn\u2019t the only beauty company with a racist ad this year. Nivea joined in on the fun by putting out its \u201cWhite Is Purity\u201d ad and got the social media flogging it deserved. Yet Dove\u2019s ad happened to be a bit more biting because black people are a huge piece of its base and because there\u2019s something very visceral about seeing a black woman morphing into a white woman in an ad that is not Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cBlack or White\u201d video\u2014especially considering the history of racist soap advertisements in America and abroad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. Dave Chappelle\u2019s Return\n\n\n\nIn March 2017, after years of being off the air and mostly out of the limelight, Dave Chappelle prepared for what looked to be a roaringly victorious return to television.\n\nThis was something black folx had been anticipating and cheering on for a long time. After watching Chappelle walk away from a $50 million contract and refuse to be Comedy Central\u2019s dancing monkey (and thereby get branded \u201cunstable\u201d because of it), we were all excited for him to stick it to the man and make a glorious comeback via Netflix.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd he surely did return, but it wasn\u2019t the unanimous victory some of us were hoping for.\n\n\n\nWith his Netflix specials, it was clear that Chappelle had not lost his sharp comedic edge and that he was still 100 percent on point about the subtleties and not-so-subtleties of white supremacy and how its food chain works (e.g., \u201cWhite women not liking their cut\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it was also very clear that Chappelle may not have completely crossed over into 2017 with the rest of us. This was particularly the case with his Bill Cosby-heavy rape jokes (e.g., \u201cHe rapes but he saves!\u201d), and his weirdly obsessive jokes at the expense of queer and trans folx.\n\nIt was fairly disappointing, to say the least, to see someone willing to push the envelope in one area of oppression (racism) and willfully refusing to adapt to the times in other areas (homophobia and transphobia).\n\nI didn\u2019t know it then, but it was surely gonna be an omen of what was to come in 2017: that killing our darlings and letting down our idols was going to be oh so necessary ... as there was absolutely no guarantee that they were going to grow and change with us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd what an omen it was.", "keywords": ["disappointing", "black", "example", "experienced", "2017", "white", "simmons", "straight", "unjust", "racist", "moments", "women", "woman"], "polarity": 0.04550587067253737, "subjectivity": 0.4992853288686623},

However, she has since filed a sexual assault complaint with the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department after a friend said to have witnessed the incident spoke about it publicly and another friend encouraged her to come forward.\n\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know him at all,\u201d Villa said of Lewandowski. \u201cI only knew him by reputation.

There were thriving and ideologically diverse cities surrounded by expansive and bucolic countrysides. There was modern technology perfectly weaved into cultural tradition, a melding that was symbiotic instead of antagonistic. And while I didn\u2019t see this happening during the movie, I\u2019m sure Wakanda has amazing bottomless brunches.\n\nUnfortunately, a present-day attempt to re-create Wakanda would be unrealistic. Mainly because we\u2019re roughly 20,000 years behind Wakandan tech. And mostly because we\u2019re too infected with colonization and its myriad residues and peripheral effects. Also, we\u2019re a little short on vibranium.\n\nOne thing, however, that we can and definitely should start doing is what M\u2019Baku and his Que Dog Jabari tribe did when encountering a problematic white dude who was speaking when there was no ask or need or purpose for the thoughts and opinions of problematic white dudes.\n\nBark.\n\nNot a purposeless bark. This isn\u2019t a shih tzu barking through the window at a squirrel. Instead, this would be an intentional bark. A targeted bark. An overpowering bark. A drowning bark. A Wakandan bark. A bark meant to communicate, \u201cUm, who told you that you can speak? When it is time for your words, we will let you know. And maybe that time will never come. We\u2019ll see. Now, just shut up and stand there. Maybe get on your phone and Google \u2018How not to be a colonizer.\u2019 Whatever you do, I want to hear you not speaking.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bark doesn\u2019t just have to be a counter for useless words, either. A wayward white hand reaches for your hair? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! A group of white people huddled on a sidewalk refuse to step aside when you attempt to walk past them? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! A purse is clutched when you walk on an elevator? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! (If they\u2019re going to act scared, you might as well give them a reason to be.)\n\nOf course, this barking will take some practice. They can\u2019t be small-dog barks, so people with higher and/or softer voices will probably have to do some training. Which is why, today, I\u2019m announcing the opening of the M\u2019Baku School of Wakandan White Silencing. The classes will be free, so no worries about me using GoFundMe monies for Bigen and creatine.\n\n\n\n(Sidenote: Also, the bark was actually an ape grunt. But it sounded like a bark and his mama named it a bark, so we gonna call it a bark.)\n\n", "keywords": ["wakandan", "start", "speak", "wakanda", "problematic", "white", "woof", "mbaku", "maybe", "turn", "words", "walk", "barking", "need", "bark"], "polarity": 0.046005889515817903, "subjectivity": 0.42366255144032927},

Would they use that generic African accent overused in Hollywood films? I looked to my left and right and wondered if the folks next to me were wondering the same things.\n\nHow would this superhero action flick \u201cuse\u201d the African characters?\n\nAfrica was not untouched by the Black Panther hype. It blew across over here ,too, with the winds stronger in some places, like in South Africa, Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe, where people there were paying close attention to actors of south and east African descent\u2014John Kani, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Daniel Kaluuya, Florence Kasumba and Danai Gurira.\n\nMany of us had seen the trailers featuring the stunning wardrobe and the spectacular special effects. We were curious to see this Dora Milaje, the all-female fighter guard assigned to protect the king and royal family. Many of us already knew that the Dora Milaje looked a lot like the Ahosi of Dahomey, aka the Dahomey \u201cAmazons,\u201d an all-female military guard formed in the late 17th century by King Wegbaja from the kingdom of Dahomey, and expanded by his son, King Agaja. We knew about the stellar cast and the mighty $200 million production budget, the most expensive movie directed by a black director with a mostly black cast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe knew these things, but still, what would the Africans, the black people, the Wakandans, look like? Many of us have grown tired of being sick and tired of how we are presented in Hollywood movies because the depictions often give the impression that Africans are backward. What would Wakanda look like?\n\nUgandan Lydia Namubiru, who saw the film in Kampala, Uganda\u2019s capital, said she went in with low expectations.\n\n\u201cMy first thought was that they are going to patronize us with stereotypes,\u201d she told The Root. \u201cEven going in, I was skeptical.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps it was a combination of measured curiosity and genuine excitement to see what could be something new in Hollywood storytelling about black people that partly drove untold numbers of people across Africa to cinemas over the past few days to catch the premiere.\n\nIn Ethiopia\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, the five daily screenings have been sold out at the sole theater showing the film. At the Accra Mall in Ghana, drummers came in beating out rhythms that heightened the crowd\u2019s enthusiasm. In Lagos, my fellow Nigerians were decked to the nines in gorgeous wax prints and chunky jewelry. In Kampala, attendants graced a cocktail hour before the premiere at the Acacia Mall.\n\nGoing out to the movies this time was like no other. This was a cultural occasion that was memorialized with selfies and social media posts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSenegal-based, Kenyan native and writer Ciku Kimeria dressed carefully in a chic, all-black assemble, and wrapped her long locks in bantu knots and adorned her neck with a colorful southern-African-inspired choker.\n\n\u201cThere was no way I was going to Wakanda just looking regular. I know black people and this is Senegal. I knew people were going to dress up,\u201d Kimeria told The Root.\n\nI joined friends and posed in front of the Black Panther poster, but I didn\u2019t know what would await me when I watched the film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, when the lights in the cinema hall dimmed, the silence took over the room and the screen lit up to a wide shot zooming in on massive cone-shaped buildings inspired by Sudano-Sahelian architecture; I knew something was happening. And I held my breath in wonder.\n\n\u201cI almost got up to clap \u2026 the hype is all worth it!\u201d Kimeria said.\n\nShe, too, was floored when she saw the architecture because it reminded her of a mosque building she had seen on a visit to the West African nation of Burkina Faso.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor many Africans, the film brought to the big screen a reality that they see everyday\u2014the Basotho blankets the warriors used as a protective shield, the queen\u2019s Zulu hat, the ochre-dyed locks of the Himba, the flowing fabrics of the Wolof. It was the sheer Pan-Africanism of it all that astounded me. The cinematic display of the diversity of African-ness was beautiful.\n\nFor some viewers, the film also represented a hope nurtured in the heart of what Africa could be. Ugandan sport radio journalist Patrick Kanyamozi told The Root that watching the film on the night it premiered in Uganda made him feel that he was part of history in the making.\n\n\u201cWhat we can learn from this film is that Africa has always had potential\u2014the gold, the diamonds and everything. It\u2019s only we were not able to work on that in the years that went by but still Africans individually can still pursue their dreams,\u201d Kanyamozi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe were humanized, and that matters,\u201d said 25-year-old Johannesburg-based South African journalist and filmmaker Sumeya Gasa. She said the whole experience was overwhelming and she is still trying to process it. \u201cIt\u2019s feels so good, too good.\u201d\n\nBut that \u201ctoo good\u201d feeling of Wakanda and what it could represent for black people in Africa and the Diaspora is what some people are trying to capture in their everyday lives. R.J. Mahdi is an Atlanta native who moved to Senegal years ago. He says that as an African American, he understood the character of the villainous N\u2019Jadaka, aka Killmonger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think Killmonger\u2019s character was an accurate depiction of the majority of black Americans feeling in one way or another. It was obviously symbolic, him being displaced from Wakanda. In retrospect, the majority of African Americans do feel that we have been abandoned in the world, and that\u2019s a tough feeling,\u201d Mahdi told The Root.\n\n\u201cWe hear it all the time. African Americans say \u2018Why didn\u2019t Africans come and fight for us in the civil rights movement or in the years of slavery?\u2019 I think that whenever you can bridge that gap and find a common ground, which was something that can happen, because even in the movie, it took them to find it out and learn each other\u2019s point of view to soften their heart towards each other in the end.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven Lydia Namubiru, the skeptical one, gave a positive review of the movie. She said she appreciated that it touched on the theme of the relationship between African Americans and Africans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe movie represented Africans\u2019 reaction to that radical Pan-Africanism that Killmonger had as just violence and just madness, as something crazy. I do feel like Killmonger being killed without properly understanding him was a pretty accurate depiction of how we react to radical Pan-Africanism,\u201d she told The Root.\n\nShe said she hopes the film will spark deeper conversations among Africans on how to do a better job of understanding black people in the Diaspora, particularly African Americans.\n\nIn the end, many viewers felt that the \u201cAfrican\u201d characters were humanized and nuanced, and there is a belief that this feeling of hope will be sustained and used as inspiration to channel the advancement of Africa. And for someone like me, who grew up being called \u201cAfrican booty scratcher\u201d and watching Africans as stock characters, I couldn\u2019t help but shed a tear at the end of the film, and I know that I was not the only one.", "keywords": ["hail", "going", "black", "audiences", "wakanda", "africans", "knew", "humanizing", "movie", "panther", "film", "characters", "told", "africa", "african"], "polarity": 0.054741522366522376, "subjectivity": 0.42516208791208787},

He is the very first mainstream black superhero ever to appear in and receive his own comic book series. His story arcs have tackled xenophobia, white supremacy, apartheid, geopolitics and everything in between.\n\nAnd while Stan \u201cthe man\u201d Lee and Jack \u201cKing\u201d Kirby deserve all credit due for his creation\u2014and his debut in Fantastic Four No. 52 (in July 1966, roughly three months before the Black Panther Party officially adopted its name)\u2014it was the writers in later decades who really seemed to shape the man and the mythology we see on the screen. Writers like Christopher Priest, Reginald Hudlin and, most recently, Ta-Nehisi Coates have greatly influenced the character of the last few decades in the books and what we see on film.\n\nBut this is an event worth remarking on because it is a first in so many aspects. It is the first big-budget superhero film from a major studio to star and feature a predominantly black cast, a black director, black screenwriters, a black executive producer and a black wardrobe designer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, it\u2019s a given that most of the film-viewing world\u2019s introduction to the warrior-king named T\u2019Challa was through 2016\u2019s Captain America: Civil War. He was arguably the breakout character of that film, leading many to remark, \u201cWhoa, who is that guy?\u201d upon his debut. But this wasn\u2019t the first Marvel movie reference to the Panther.\n\nInterestingly enough, the existence of the Panther was hinted at as far back as 2010\u2019s Iron Man 2, where his fictional homeland of Wakanda was shown on a map as a place Nick Fury was surveilling. It has also been confirmed that T\u2019Challa has been the current Panther since at least 2008.\n\nBut Civil War was when eagle-eyed fans understandably started asking, \u201cSo what\u2019s up with that movie though?\u201d to which Marvel came back with the highly suspect response at the time that could be summed up as, \u201cUmmm ... well, we don\u2019t have the technology to create an accurate Wakanda right now ... but let us know what you think of Thor\u2019s majestic otherworldly realm of Asgard, the Kree homeworld, and Neverwhere in Guardians of the Galaxy!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I digress.\n\nAfter his Civil War appearance was met with overwhelmingly positive feedback, Marvel Studios finally green-lighted a Black Panther film.\n\nT\u2019Challa and Wakanda\u2019s mythology are potent symbols on multiple levels.\n\nIn T\u2019Challa, you have essentially the ultimate overachiever ruling a veritable nation of overachievers. Here is a man who can trace his lineage back to 10 millennia of warrior kings and queens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWakanda itself has a proud legacy based on its being not only the sole place on Earth where the fictional metal vibranium (the substance Captain America\u2019s shield is composed of) can be found, but also a society that has blended nature and technology to such an advanced stage, it is centuries ahead of anywhere else on the planet. This is in no small part due to Wakanda\u2019s never knowing the horrors of colonialism. It\u2019s literally a nation of the unconquered.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t for lack of trying by nearly everyone. Rival African nations, Belgian slave traders and honest-to-goodness extraterrestrial invaders (the intergalactic Skrull Empire and emissaries of the Mad Titan, Thanos, no less) all tried, and failed, in the comics to take over the African nation.\n\nBut, ultimately, with Black Panther the character, the thing that most strongly resonates for me is the idea that this is a superhero who is self-empowered. Even in his first cinematic appearance in Captain America: Civil War, you never get the sense that he is getting swept up in the other characters\u2019 stories. It\u2019s very clear that he has his own agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, as much as characters like James Rhodes (War Machine) and Sam Wilson (the Falcon) are satisfactory heroes in their own right, they seem mainly there to support Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, respectively. Also, their particular gimmicks are bestowed upon them through technology\u2014technology of which neither is the creator.\n\nWhich means that if they lose their gadgets, they are essentially powerless.\n\nInterestingly, Sam \u201cthe Falcon\u201d Wilson in the Ultimate Marvel series of books, which the Marvel Cinematic Universe was heavily influenced by, was the creator of the flight harness that gives him the ability to fly. However, for some reason, they decided not to include this as part of the character\u2019s backstory in the films.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompare this with Black Panther\u2019s powers: He was a peak-level human mentally and physically before any enhancements. He possesses elite Olympic athletic abilities and has multiple degrees, including a Ph.D. from Oxford in physics. He is considered to be one of the most brilliant minds on Earth. The Black Panther title is a rank of office. The habit he wears is a mark of status as the protector and spiritual leader of Wakanda and the Panther Cult.\n\nAfter undergoing the trials that all Black Panthers must overcome, he earns the right to consume a heart-shaped herb indigenous to Wakanda that further enhances his already formidable abilities to superhuman levels. The herb is roughly analogous to the super soldier serum that is responsible for Captain America\u2019s powers. This plant, however, is toxic to anyone who is not a member of the royal bloodline. So if you aren\u2019t genetically related to Bashenga, the first leader of the Panther Cult 10,000 years ago, you will suffer potentially lethal side effects and no benefit from eating the plant. (It has recently been revealed that Bashenga is the second being in history to hold the Black Panther title and is predated by another in 1,000,000. Don\u2019t ask. It gets even weirder.)\n\nHow weird will the movie get? It\u2019s delving into the realm of utopian Afrofuturism, something we\u2019ve never really seen on this scale in a motion picture. In fact, it\u2019s pretty likely that Black Panther, the film, will be sui generis, completely unlike anything we\u2019ve seen on film before (and quite a few reviews bear this out).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo don\u2019t be ashamed to get hyped, get your tickets and get somewhat initiated into the Panther Cult via this filmgoing experience\u2014something I\u2019ve been into since childhood (and not just because my last name almost spells \u201cpanther\u201d). Because for comic readers like me, the reality of Black Panther and Wakanda getting their due in a multimillion-dollar sci-fi spectacular is the culmination of a lifelong dream that has me saying, \u201cLong live the king,\u201d but also, long live this dream of black excellence personified.\n\nJada Prather is an educator, artist and illustrator based in Washington, D.C., by way of New York City.

You\u2019ve been waiting for it for years, got excited for the trailers and even read all of the newer Ta-Nehisi Coates- and Roxane Gay- and Yona Harvey-penned comic books. And while you didn\u2019t go full Wakandan cosplay for the premiere, you did wear all black. Even copped a beret from the beret-copping store. And of course, you loved the film. Couldn\u2019t stop raving about it. Even plan to see it again next weekend.\n\n\n\nYour girlfriend, whom you saw it with, loved it, too. And she\u2019s also planning to see it again. Not with you, though\u2014with her girlfriends. They planned an entire evening, actually. The movie and then group massages. Which is great, you guess, that women are also very interested in Black Panther. And understandable, with the strong female characters and feminist themes throughout the film. It\u2019s just kinda odd to you that on that type of girls\u2019 night out, they\u2019d get the massages after the movie. Like the viewing experience is so intense that they needed some deep-tissue care afterward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour suspicions grew yesterday when you saw her making Wakandan doodles in a notebook. You had no idea she knew Wakandan. Shit, you didn\u2019t even know she had notebooks! And then you checked the Twitter profile of her friend Keisha. And saw that she changed her screen name from \u201cKeesh the Scientist\u201d to \u201cWakandan Mouth Party.\u201d And her timeline is filled with retweets of college photos of Winston Duke.\n\nUnfortunately, your girlfriend and her friends\u2014like many others\u2014have caught Wakandan fever. It\u2019s not your fault, really, that you\u2019re spending your days replying to emails, ordering from Uber Eats and playing in coed dodgeball leagues while these Wakandan niggas are wrestling topless on cliffs, living on mountaintop thrones, riding rhinoceroses, wearing skintight panther suits, flying spaceships and saying things like \u201cHey, Auntie.\u201d You\u2019d wrestle a nigga on a cliff, too, if cliffs were available in your neighborhood.\n\nSadly, the clifflessness of your life just isn\u2019t exciting anymore. Also, although you had muscles in college, telling your girl you \u201chad muscles in college\u201d only goes so far when diesel Wakandans are on Imax screens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFortunately, this Wakandan fever isn\u2019t the end of the world for you, as there are a couple things to keep in mind, including:\n\n1.

Would they use that generic African accent overused in Hollywood films? I looked to my left and right and wondered if the folks next to me were wondering the same things.\n\nHow would this superhero action flick \u201cuse\u201d the African characters?\n\nAfrica was not untouched by the Black Panther hype. It blew across over here ,too, with the winds stronger in some places, like in South Africa, Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe, where people there were paying close attention to actors of south and east African descent\u2014John Kani, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Daniel Kaluuya, Florence Kasumba and Danai Gurira.\n\nMany of us had seen the trailers featuring the stunning wardrobe and the spectacular special effects. We were curious to see this Dora Milaje, the all-female fighter guard assigned to protect the king and royal family. Many of us already knew that the Dora Milaje looked a lot like the Ahosi of Dahomey, aka the Dahomey \u201cAmazons,\u201d an all-female military guard formed in the late 17th century by King Wegbaja from the kingdom of Dahomey, and expanded by his son, King Agaja. We knew about the stellar cast and the mighty $200 million production budget, the most expensive movie directed by a black director with a mostly black cast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe knew these things, but still, what would the Africans, the black people, the Wakandans, look like? Many of us have grown tired of being sick and tired of how we are presented in Hollywood movies because the depictions often give the impression that Africans are backward. What would Wakanda look like?\n\nUgandan Lydia Namubiru, who saw the film in Kampala, Uganda\u2019s capital, said she went in with low expectations.\n\n\u201cMy first thought was that they are going to patronize us with stereotypes,\u201d she told The Root. \u201cEven going in, I was skeptical.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps it was a combination of measured curiosity and genuine excitement to see what could be something new in Hollywood storytelling about black people that partly drove untold numbers of people across Africa to cinemas over the past few days to catch the premiere.\n\nIn Ethiopia\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, the five daily screenings have been sold out at the sole theater showing the film. At the Accra Mall in Ghana, drummers came in beating out rhythms that heightened the crowd\u2019s enthusiasm. In Lagos, my fellow Nigerians were decked to the nines in gorgeous wax prints and chunky jewelry. In Kampala, attendants graced a cocktail hour before the premiere at the Acacia Mall.\n\nGoing out to the movies this time was like no other. This was a cultural occasion that was memorialized with selfies and social media posts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSenegal-based, Kenyan native and writer Ciku Kimeria dressed carefully in a chic, all-black assemble, and wrapped her long locks in bantu knots and adorned her neck with a colorful southern-African-inspired choker.\n\n\u201cThere was no way I was going to Wakanda just looking regular. I know black people and this is Senegal. I knew people were going to dress up,\u201d Kimeria told The Root.\n\nI joined friends and posed in front of the Black Panther poster, but I didn\u2019t know what would await me when I watched the film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, when the lights in the cinema hall dimmed, the silence took over the room and the screen lit up to a wide shot zooming in on massive cone-shaped buildings inspired by Sudano-Sahelian architecture; I knew something was happening. And I held my breath in wonder.\n\n\u201cI almost got up to clap \u2026 the hype is all worth it!\u201d Kimeria said.\n\nShe, too, was floored when she saw the architecture because it reminded her of a mosque building she had seen on a visit to the West African nation of Burkina Faso.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor many Africans, the film brought to the big screen a reality that they see everyday\u2014the Basotho blankets the warriors used as a protective shield, the queen\u2019s Zulu hat, the ochre-dyed locks of the Himba, the flowing fabrics of the Wolof. It was the sheer Pan-Africanism of it all that astounded me. The cinematic display of the diversity of African-ness was beautiful.\n\nFor some viewers, the film also represented a hope nurtured in the heart of what Africa could be. Ugandan sport radio journalist Patrick Kanyamozi told The Root that watching the film on the night it premiered in Uganda made him feel that he was part of history in the making.\n\n\u201cWhat we can learn from this film is that Africa has always had potential\u2014the gold, the diamonds and everything. It\u2019s only we were not able to work on that in the years that went by but still Africans individually can still pursue their dreams,\u201d Kanyamozi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe were humanized, and that matters,\u201d said 25-year-old Johannesburg-based South African journalist and filmmaker Sumeya Gasa. She said the whole experience was overwhelming and she is still trying to process it. \u201cIt\u2019s feels so good, too good.\u201d\n\nBut that \u201ctoo good\u201d feeling of Wakanda and what it could represent for black people in Africa and the Diaspora is what some people are trying to capture in their everyday lives. R.J. Mahdi is an Atlanta native who moved to Senegal years ago. He says that as an African American, he understood the character of the villainous N\u2019Jadaka, aka Killmonger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think Killmonger\u2019s character was an accurate depiction of the majority of black Americans feeling in one way or another. It was obviously symbolic, him being displaced from Wakanda. In retrospect, the majority of African Americans do feel that we have been abandoned in the world, and that\u2019s a tough feeling,\u201d Mahdi told The Root.\n\n\u201cWe hear it all the time. African Americans say \u2018Why didn\u2019t Africans come and fight for us in the civil rights movement or in the years of slavery?\u2019 I think that whenever you can bridge that gap and find a common ground, which was something that can happen, because even in the movie, it took them to find it out and learn each other\u2019s point of view to soften their heart towards each other in the end.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven Lydia Namubiru, the skeptical one, gave a positive review of the movie. She said she appreciated that it touched on the theme of the relationship between African Americans and Africans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe movie represented Africans\u2019 reaction to that radical Pan-Africanism that Killmonger had as just violence and just madness, as something crazy. I do feel like Killmonger being killed without properly understanding him was a pretty accurate depiction of how we react to radical Pan-Africanism,\u201d she told The Root.\n\nShe said she hopes the film will spark deeper conversations among Africans on how to do a better job of understanding black people in the Diaspora, particularly African Americans.\n\nIn the end, many viewers felt that the \u201cAfrican\u201d characters were humanized and nuanced, and there is a belief that this feeling of hope will be sustained and used as inspiration to channel the advancement of Africa. And for someone like me, who grew up being called \u201cAfrican booty scratcher\u201d and watching Africans as stock characters, I couldn\u2019t help but shed a tear at the end of the film, and I know that I was not the only one.", "keywords": ["hail", "going", "black", "audiences", "wakanda", "africans", "knew", "humanizing", "movie", "panther", "film", "characters", "told", "africa", "african"], "polarity": 0.054741522366522376, "subjectivity": 0.42516208791208787},

While Black Panther is a Marvel Cinematic Universe product, it\u2019s still a black movie. From Ryan Coogler to Wakanda to kente cloth in videos to the two capital letters and the apostrophe in the lead character T\u2019Challa\u2019s name, there\u2019s no denying the blackness at play here.\n\nAnd like peanut butter and jelly, Shaq and Kobe, and salt and pepper, black movies aren\u2019t complete without a soundtrack. Can I get an \u201camen\u201d? I think I got an \u201camen.\u201d Do you know why? Because God is good (all the time) and all the time (God is good). Tell me you didn\u2019t say that out loud just now. It\u2019s OK\u2014I know. I did too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201990s were full of movies with great soundtracks. Faizon Love once joked that soundtrack budgets back then were bigger than the budget for the actual movie. Not surprisingly, most of those soundtracks were as good as, if not better than, the movies themselves. From Boomerang to Above the Rim to Waiting to Exhale, black movie soundtracks came, saw and conquered. Just last weekend, I got into a full debate about the best black movie soundtrack, though we included blaxploitation movies, so of course the soundtracks for Superfly and The Mack were name-checked. Dear The Mack, I choose you. See what I did there?\n\nSince the \u201990s, though, short of a few movies here and there like Brown Sugar and Love & Basketball, black movies haven\u2019t been as heavily soundtrack-focused as they used to be. You can chalk that up to the fact that the black movie market, while thriving on an independent level\u2014shouts to Amazon Prime and Netflix\u2014isn\u2019t as commercially poppin\u2019 as it once was outside of Tyler Perry, T.D. Jakes (occasionally) and Spike Lee.\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been a movie, in all honesty, that really lent itself to dedicating an entire soundtrack of new material to it. T.I. made his 2006 classic album, King, the de facto soundtrack for the movie ATL. Jay-Z did something similar with American Gangster, but it just hasn\u2019t been the same since Snoop came through and crushed the buildings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnter Black Panther, the movie that has black folks across America forgetting that we\u2019re all about to make Mickey Mouse a whole lot of money and he will not be fixing the hood in the process. Like most black folks, I\u2019m excited for this movie, and I was waiting for this soundtrack to drop because, I mean, we got us a black movie with a black soundtrack again. In Black History Month, no less. This couldn\u2019t get any blacker unless Allen Iverson\u2019s mother started braiding his hair at the movie theater while he watched Black Panther.\n\nSo what about the actual soundtrack, P?\n\nOh, right. With Kung Fu Kenny (Kendrick Lamar) quarterbacking the project, it features lots of names you know and many you probably don\u2019t. More than half of the TDE roster shows up (Kendrick, Ab-Soul, Jay Rock, Schoolboy Q and SZA), and current heavy hitters like the Weeknd, Travis Scott, 2 Chainz, James Blake, Anderson .Paak, Vince Staples, Khalid and Swae Lee from Rae Sremmurd show up alongside lesser-known but talented artists like Zacari and Jorja Smith.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo is this a good soundtrack? Seems like that depends on whom you ask. My first few runs through the project\u2014at this point, I\u2019ve listened to it roughly six times\u2014is that it\u2019s fair to middling. \u201cAll the Stars\u201d is head and tails the best song on the album, so it\u2019s not surprising that it was the single. I like a few other songs, like \u201cThe Ways,\u201d \u201cRedemption,\u201d \u201cSeasons,\u201d \u201cBig Shot\u201d and \u201cX.\u201d \u201cX\u201d took repeated listens, so I\u2019m not sure if I actually like it or if I\u2019ve been incepted. I don\u2019t care much for the rest of the songs. One run through social media might have you believing that I\u2019m sniffin\u2019 glue, though. I don\u2019t sniff glue, by the way.\n\nObviously it\u2019s too early to tell how this will fare in the black-movie-soundtrack pantheon. Plus, making it over the Above the Rim mountain is almost an impossibility. I think the sound of the project as a whole is interesting; Sounwave really made his presence felt. But I think our soundtracks from the \u201990s were so iconic and we have so much nostalgia built into them that I\u2019m getting misty-eyed thinking about the Sunset Park soundtrack, and I can\u2019t name more than two songs off of it from memory (at the moment).\n\nBut we pretty much got another Kendrick Lamar album, and that\u2019s never a bad thing. The themes are interesting, to say the least, because of what the movie seems to be about, and there are several places on this album that are fairly standard-issue trap-nigga fare. Not sure how that fits with the theme of Black Panther, but I haven\u2019t seen it yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLargely though, it\u2019s good to have a movie, especially one with as big a budget and as much commercial appeal as Black Panther, get the black-movie-soundtrack treatment.

We\u2019re talking about the powerful women of the Dora Milaje and the scene-stealing M\u2019Baku (Winston Duke), and we even got a new handshake to share with our folk.\n\nGIF\n\nBut as excitement reached its peak after our first look, or looks, at the blockbuster, so have cries of #TeamTChalla\u2014better known as Black Panther\u2014vs. #TeamKillmonger (Michael B. Jordan). But as hell-bent as Killmonger seems to be on black liberation, support for anti-hero/villain Killmonger (Wakandan name: N\u2019Jadaka) may be misplaced, because it clearly comes with a side of toxic masculinity.\n\nDuring my first\u2014and second\u2014viewing of the film, I was undeniably moved by Killmonger. He spoke with the pained voice of black America, a voice that\u2019s been disconnected from its African roots and stifled and silenced by centuries of oppression. One of his first lines in the film is to ask the white female curator of an African art exhibit: \u201cHow do you think your ancestors got these? You think they paid a fair price for it? Or did they take them, like they took everything else?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my theater, a cheer rose from the audience of mostly black folk. When he later pointed out that Wakanda has just been chilling on the sidelines while billions of black folk around the world were suffering, I heard more than a few folks say, \u201cYasss\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d He definitely had a point: Black liberation has always been a debate between tactical resistance and revolution by any means necessary. So it\u2019s not surprising that as more and more think pieces emerge, many are split between #TeamKillmonger and #TeamTChalla.\n\nBut after viewing the movie a second time, I noticed Killmonger\u2019s hella problematic approach to liberation (shoutout to Oakland, Calif.). In a movie that otherwise unabashedly celebrates black women, his actions express a deep misogynoir that begins with the killing of his nameless girlfriend and extends through his scoffing at his aunt, the regal Ramonda (Angela Bassett); choking a female elder/shaman; murdering one of the Dora Milaje; injuring Nakia; and nearly killing Shuri.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKillmonger repeatedly expresses his desire to demolish white European supremacy in favor of a black empire. His analysis of the European oppressors who stole, raped and pillaged their way across the world is not inaccurate. Black people all over the world (except the fictional Wakanda) have had their asses kicked by colonialism. But even with expansive technology and wealth at his fingertips, the only way Killmonger can think to correct this is by mimicking the behavior of the colonizer. He is not merely desiring justice but is lusting for revenge. He\u2019s not on a mission for liberation; he wants annihilation. His brutality is the very embodiment of toxic masculinity.\n\nIn a movie where no character uttered the n-word and black womanhood was centered, Killmonger\u2019s violence toward women\u2014black women in particular\u2014was stark and pronounced. Is this what we think of black American men? With a black American man helming the movie, it would be troubling to think that Killmonger could be read as unilaterally representative of black American male consciousness.\n\nErik Stevens, later Killmonger, is a black male character raised in America\u2014in Oakland, to be precise, the birthplace of the actual Black Panthers. He is a fictional black child whose mother we never see on-screen, who then grows into a black man who has seen violence both personal (the murder of his father) and political (the Rodney King verdict and the Los Angeles riots).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStevens has presumably watched and taken notes on the political realities of America; two years after his father\u2019s death, President Bill Clinton would sign the 1994 crime bill that exponentially increased the black prison population. He escapes that fate by attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, joining the CIA and becoming a political mercenary. He is a product of his upbringing, and his rage is justified.\n\nBut Black Panther presents another path to global black freedom for its audience to consider. Instead of #TeamTChalla or #TeamKillmonger, why aren\u2019t we #TeamNakia?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom almost her first appearance in Black Panther, the character of Nakia told T\u2019Challa about himself and Wakanda, that their country couldn\u2019t idly sit back and watch the world annihilate blackness. She, embracing an arguably more Afrofuturist mindset, wanted restorative justice and liberation for black people across the world\u2014not with guns but with the blessing of Wakandan aid\u2014through their expansive technology and wealth. While it\u2019s true that sometimes revolution requires that we be armed, Nakia\u2019s point of view argued that we cannot rely solely on military might to accomplish our collective goals.\n\nComparing Nakia\u2019s and Erik\u2019s visions for liberation invites us to examine our values when it comes to revolution. And while I don\u2019t agree with everything in TaLynn Kel\u2019s article \u201cAn American Monster in Wakanda,\u201d she does have a point about the complicity of everyone but the character of Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o):\n\n\n\n\ufeffNakia knew it wasn\u2019t enough, which was why she could not stay. Would not stay and in the end, should not stay. Wakanda was complicit in the genocide of millions while looking at those suffering not with compassion, but with dismissal. Wakanda Forever really meant Wakanda first and only. Ignoring genocide doesn\u2019t exempt you from responsibility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese two visions of how we get free also ask us to take a look at our views about gender and masculinity\u2014and how our own silence often equals violence. As 45 percent of ticket buyers during Black Panther\u2019s opening weekend were women, there is also a call for us to bear witness to the ways in which we\u2014especially as black women\u2014are complicit in toxic masculinity in our social movements.\n\nIn a poignant moment after they both believe that T\u2019Challa has been murdered, his general, Okoye (Danai Gurira), and Nakia confront each other. Okoye pledges to serve the throne unconditionally, while Nakia wants to save the country (and black people), but not in service to Killmonger. It\u2019s reminiscent of the ways in which some black women will unconditionally support and protect black men who are obviously dangerous to our communities (R. Kelly, Bill Cosby, etc.) in favor of protecting the idea of blackness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut liberation cannot come on the backs of black women. We have to resist glorifying the character in the story that represents a problematic bag of liberation goals. It is not enough to claim a desire to free black folk, all while murdering, assaulting and disposing of black women. It is not enough to fight for justice while undergirding it with vengeance. Liberation must be for all.\n\nI need to be clear: I love Black Panther for so many reasons, including the way that it\u2019s pushing us to have some much-needed conversations. So much of the film resonated with me, even Killmonger\u2019s poignant last words: \u201cBury me in the ocean with my ancestors that jumped from the ships. Because they knew death was better than bondage.\u201d Those words burned me to my soul.\n\nAs a character, Killmonger reminded me of the oft-quoted James Baldwin: \u201cTo be black and conscious in America is to be in a constant state of rage.\u201d But I also know that when rage is directed solely into vengeance and not justice\u2014at the expense of black women and in the form of blind violence against them\u2014then who are we, if not mirroring our oppressors?", "keywords": ["world", "black", "hero", "liberation", "wakanda", "nakia", "worship", "trouble", "killmonger", "think", "violence", "teamkillmonger", "women", "character", "teamtoxicmasculinity"], "polarity": 0.01912185610532719, "subjectivity": 0.40012611355586547},

I went to London, Amsterdam ... and I would have kept going, through the overpriced splendor of Scandinavia, or the lush, economically disenfranchised ruins of Athens, but Berlin stopped me in my tracks.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a city best described as charming ... and lawless. Somewhere between watching a green-haired comedian hammer nails up his nose at an underground comedy club at a punk squat, and attending a fetish club, where people in latex underwear debated politics before making out in an indoor swimming pool\u2014I decided that this was the place for me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve been here since August.\n\nGermany, and Berlin in particular, has a reputation of being progressive. With free tertiary education available to anyone, a strict recycling program and unimpeachable tenancy rights, it certainly presents as a pretty picture upon first glance. But much like the history behind this troubled, vibrant city, there\u2019s a wall you have to break through first.\n\nThe first thing local (or foreign) Berliners will warn you about is the bureaucracy. The authenticity of German stereotypes varies from person to person, but one thing that requires no exaggeration is this country\u2019s obsession with paperwork.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s wonderful to live in a city with rent control. Less so when it means filing a binder of documents, and a five-minute registration process that requires a three-month advance booking, a series of signatures and the occasional sexual favor. Not speaking from experience, of course, but that\u2019s not to say that I haven\u2019t felt royally screwed whenever I\u2019ve left the Finanzamt (tax office) or B\u00fcrgeramt (registration office).\n\nThere are just some things you accept as part of life in Berlin: being yelled at for crossing the street at a red light, offering to pay for dinner to avoid the awkwardness of watching a German man divide the bill, and having to systematically flash my paperwork to do, well, anything. In return, I get to live in a city where nature is fiercely preserved and radical queer feminists host summer barbecues where white people with dreadlocks are charged twice the admission as people of color.\n\nAnd even though it has a population of 3.7 million, 13.5 percent of whom identify as foreign-born, black people experience Berlin very differently from white people\u2014a reality that became abundantly clear to Jessica Lauren Elizabeth Taylor, an artist from Florida. Initially interested in just a summer visit, Taylor describes her first impression of Berlin as \u201cpure, unadulterated magic.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was Berlin\u2019s radical theater scene that appealed to her artistically and, ultimately, compelled her to stay instead of moving on to Paris as initially planned. That was eight years ago.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was really impressed ... I was in awe,\u201d she says.\n\nShe describes Berlin as ripe for experimental performance art ... but also sorely lacking in discussions on race and intersectionality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome years ago, she attended a prominent ex-pat magazine\u2019s panel discussion about the African experience in Berlin, an event where distinguished Afro-Deutsche panelists were silenced from participating in discussions with which they had direct experience. She says the conversations revolved around that month\u2019s publication, which featured a cover story about how one journalist spent his day with a black drug dealer.\n\n\u201cIt was unreal,\u201d she says.\n\nThat\u2019s why she started Black in Berlin in 2012, a regular salon series that provides people of color a place to discuss the issues important to them ... and the occasional trap-music party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe says that racism has definitely been the biggest challenge of living in Berlin.\n\n\u201cThe city and the people are still very far behind,\u201d she says. \u201cThe German word for racism, rassismus, wasn\u2019t even put into the German dictionary until 1996. All the words used to discuss racism are in English. It\u2019s a challenge.\u201d\n\nEven though Germany has publicly atoned for the atrocities committed during the Holocaust, a political resistance to combat spiking rates in hate crime, along with continued denial of historical atrocities like the 20th-century genocide in modern-day Namibia, makes it a frustrating experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaylor is well aware of these double standards. And, after eight years, she reflects pensively on the time she\u2019s spent here and admits that her feelings on the city are conflicted.\n\n\u201cThe spirit of this city is on shaky ground,\u201d she says. Her initial infatuation with Berlin is now mixed with tension, but she finds comfort in the black, queer art community fostered over recent years.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing I love about Berlin is that you can really be free to be yourself here,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMark Ivan Mukiibi Serunjogi, a digital marketing manager, agrees. He grew up in an East African community in Copenhagen and moved to Berlin in January of last year for a role with an e-commerce retailer. Serunjogi says that after living in Brooklyn, N.Y., for a while, he had really low expectations about returning to Europe, and that\u2019s why Berlin has exceeded them.\n\n\u201cAfter going to America, I became aware of so many things still wrong with our [Danish] society. We have this way of telling ourselves that we\u2019re so great and we\u2019re over things. ... America made me more aware. I was worried about coming back to mostly white Europe,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Serunjogi believes that working in an international business really helped to assuage those fears, allowing him room to explore the city with an open mind and heart, which ultimately led him to the Black in Berlin group. He says that Googling hip-hop parties in Berlin took him to a late-night event where he met a member who told him about the salon discussions.\n\n\u201cHe had me at \u2018black,\u2019\u201d he says.\n\nWith the added support of a community of color, a solid job and a place to live, Serunjogi says he\u2019s made it work for himself here\u2014but not everything is pleasant. \u201cThe worst aspect about living in Berlin is the dating experience,\u201d he says. The city has a reputation of being hopelessly single, and regardless of your sexual orientation, you\u2019re bound to come away with some pretty wild Tinder stories ... like that one time a doctor proposed to me in a WhatsApp message while high on LSD and MDMA (Ecstasy). Classic Berlin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut he agrees with Taylor that the freedom found in this city makes overcoming those challenges worth the effort\u2014though he warns it\u2019s not for everyone. When asked whether he would recommend the city to other black people considering Blaxit, he said it depends on one\u2019s frame of reference.\n\n\u201cGrowing up in Denmark prepared me to live in a mostly white space again in Germany,\u201d says Serunjogi, which is why his expectations were exceeded with the discovery of the local black community.\n\n\u201cLiving in Europe [before] gave me tools to deal with that ... but if you come to Berlin because you\u2019re expecting something better, you\u2019ll be disappointed,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvising that the best way to experience Berlin is to be open (and ready to be called out on cultural differences), Serunjogi says that giving new voices space to be heard is critical to anyone who has previously lived in America, as he has.\n\nThough Taylor admits that openness is one of the many benefits of living in Berlin, her advice is a bit more practical: \u201cLearn German ... and use it as a weapon.\u201d\n\nAs a newly minted local, I can definitely say, \u201cIch stimme zu.\u201d", "keywords": ["experience", "black", "really", "living", "city", "white", "berlin", "blaxit", "present", "german", "considering", "taylor", "serunjogi"], "polarity": 0.09880833077683478, "subjectivity": 0.40610284728394946},

Not in the sense that you\u2019ve seen anything like it before (trust me, you haven\u2019t), but rather that seeing it feels like coming home.\n\n\n\nFor all of its technological wonders and visual delights, Black Panther is, in its deepest heart of hearts, the type of family drama that nearly everyone can relate to in one way or another. Before diving into the present-day status quo established in Captain America: Civil War, Black Panther opens with a promise and a betrayal\u2014fraternal twins of fate whose very existences immediately give the movie\u2019s plot a Shakespearean sense of grandeur and intimacy.\n\nThe promise is of Wakanda itself\u2014symbolized in a brief, but powerful flashback to a younger T\u2019Chaka (played in his prime by Atandwa Kani, whose father, John Kani, portrays the older T\u2019Chaka both here and in Civil War) checking in on a covert intelligence mission in the United States. The betrayal is what T\u2019Chaka finds, a revelation that both changes the course of Wakanda\u2019s future and gets at the heart of one of the more difficult ideas Black Panther repeatedly asks: If Wakanda is the mighty beacon of excellence it claims to be, why hasn\u2019t it done more to help the world?\n\nThe question rises to the surface of the Royal Family\u2019s minds once again after an encounter with Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) inadvertently draws CIA agent Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman) into the Wakandans\u2019 midst. The country\u2019s culture of secrecy and isolationism is an important and fascinating part of its larger mythos, but it\u2019s one that Black Panther purposefully inspects and challenges through the various drives and goals of its characters.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs its newly crowned King, T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman) is deeply vested in hewing to tradition, as his mother and father taught him. But a certain degree of uncertainty about how to embody a king\u2019s identity gives him the opportunity for some flexibility in his approach to shaping Wakanda\u2019s relationship to the world. Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), a spy who frequently travels beyond Wakanda\u2019s borders and has seen the strife and poverty in the wider world, is adamant that Wakanda could become a larger force for global good. Describing Okoye (Danai Gurira) as simply the general of the Dora Milaje isn\u2019t entirely accurate; she is in almost every sense of the title, Hand to the King, second only to his mother Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett). Together, they represent a strong bloc in favor of Wakandan traditionalism\u2014a bloc that would be completely unified were it not for Princess Shuri (Letitia Wright), T\u2019Challa\u2019s genius, teenaged sister who\u2019s more interested in her scientific research at the Wakandan Design Group than family politics.\n\nThough the Royal Family and those closest to them are not always in agreement with one another, there\u2019s a balance to their nuclear unit which strengthens the Wakandan throne. The stability of the Royal Family ensures the trust and allegiance of the other Wakandan tribes\u2014like the Jabari, a group of anti-technological people who live in the mountainous northern region of the country, where they\u2019re led by M\u2019Baku (Winston Duke). Each of the Wakandan tribes is a distinct cultural presence led by different figureheads who all have their own political agendas.\n\nWakanda\u2019s inner workings are intricate and at times strained, but the status quo of remaining isolated works specifically because the Wakandans put their own survival first. Given the specter of colonialism on the African continent, that\u2019s understandable. However, the promise of Wakanda introduced during the film\u2019s opening is, in a striking and beautiful way, the audience\u2019s entryway into seeing how someone from the outside might grow to resent the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Black Panther is actually one of the more grounded and human Marvel films, Erik Killmonger\u2019s (Michael B. Jordan) villainous motivation is immediately understandable and completely relatable. If you knew what he knew, you\u2019d want to fight T\u2019Challa, too. Even in the moments where Killmonger\u2019s ambition to take the Wakandan throne boil over into overt bloodthirstiness, there\u2019s a voice in the back of your head reminding you what brought him to that point, and why maybe he has a point.\n\nIn a very literal way, Killmonger is the embodiment of the pain and anguish that comes along with being a black American who is unable to trace their familial roots back more than a few generations. Those gaps in ancestral knowledge are the direct result of families being murdered and wiped from the historical record, never to be fully known or remembered by their descendants. Killmonger\u2019s trauma is something that T\u2019Challa can\u2019t fully grasp, given the nature of his own upbringing. The two become diametrically opposed to one another, despite the fact that they are both fundamentally fighting for the betterment of their shared people.\n\nOf all the players in T\u2019Challa\u2019s orbit, Killmonger is the most extreme in his beliefs that Wakanda should be both open and expansionist. His vision is the all-too-understandable conclusion that dawns on every single black person once we consider everything an open Wakanda could be and mean, not just for the world, but specifically for the African diaspora. Black Panther asks the kinds of questions about Wakanda that aren\u2019t fun to think about, but are important all the same. How might the course of history been changed had the country not been closed off? What might global blackness look and feel like in a world like that? The Marvel Cinematic Universe is a world in which those questions can be asked in earnest and the Wakandan people have to grapple with the possible answers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Panther would not have been as strong a movie if it didn\u2019t contemplate those heavier concepts, but the film also never misses a beat to be absolutely joyous and reverent about Wakanda\u2019s magnificence. Though Wakanda is an Afrofuturist wonderland, it\u2019s still meant to be an actual place on Earth and it feels like it. Director Ryan Coogler and cinematographer Rachel Morrison craft breathtaking, on-the-ground shots that give Wakanda\u2019s streets a texture and vibrancy that blends old-world hustle and bustle with gleaming accents of the future.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s also pleasantly surprising how funny Black Panther is. While the movie\u2019s tone never dips too, too deep into abject misery, there are enough moments of solemnity that when a joke about T\u2019Challa\u2019s dad sandals pops up, you\u2019re not really prepared to laugh quite that hard. Though the movie\u2019s comedic moments land squarely, they\u2019re also subtle, often bubbling up suddenly\u2014almost as if willed into existence by the chemistry between the cast. There\u2019s a palpable love between T\u2019Challa, Ramonda, Shuri, and Okoye that propels them forward as a unit; at the same time, there\u2019s a complicated understanding between them all and Killmonger that keeps the plot compelling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Panther\u2019s action builds effortless, upward momentum that immediately reminds you that you\u2019re still in a humongous Marvel movie. Thankfully, there\u2019s no big, glowing, CGI deus ex machina waiting as Black Panther\u2019s ultimate big bad, but the film\u2019s penultimate major battle is chock full of just enough explosions to scratch your itch if you\u2019re into that kind of thing.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s so much more to say about Black Panther because, like Wakanda, it\u2019s an embarrassment of riches that you can\u2019t really hope to fully unpack in one sitting. It\u2019s the kind of Marvel movie that definitely benefits from more than a single viewing, and it\u2019s one that\u2019ll draw you in\u2014and blow your mind every single time.", "keywords": ["world", "wakandan", "black", "wakanda", "wakandas", "epic", "tchalla", "family", "panther", "theres", "marvels", "shakespearean", "marvel"], "polarity": 0.12236610288935874, "subjectivity": 0.46050496660961776},

Everyone\u2019s fixated on the screen, and the movie\u2019s jokes may get a laugh or two, but because most everyone there is there working, it\u2019s just not the same as sitting back and just having fun.\n\n\n\nLike a lot of people across the world, I saw Marvel\u2019s Black Panther multiple times this weekend because I wanted to pore deeply over the film\u2019s narrative layers and drink in the visual richness that is Wakanda. But as I hopped around from theater to theater in New York City, something else\u2014something beautiful about the movie\u2014became clear for me: The only way to really appreciate how powerful Black Panther is is to see it in a black movie theater with a predominantly black audience.\n\nBecause of how close it is to my apartment, the AMC Magic Johnson in Harlem is where I\u2019ve ended up seeing nearly every Marvel movie for the past few years, but the atmosphere in the theater this past Friday was unlike anything I\u2019d ever experienced there before. Long before even stepping foot inside the building, you could tell who had made their way to Harlem specifically to see Black Panther and how, for many people, the night was part of a bigger cultural event. In the light of the lobby, you could see groups of women rocking gorgeously styled geles and excitedly stanning in front of larger-than-life cutouts of Danai Gurira\u2019s Okoye in her Wakandan finest.\n\nKids in panther masks weaved their way in and out of the ridiculously long line of people waiting to scan their tickets, and even though the place was hectic, you could feel just how pumped everyone was\u2014not just for the movie itself but also to be celebrating something like Black Panther in a distinctly black space.\n\nNo two audiences react to a film the exact same way, but what was enlivening about sitting in a theater full of black families and friends was the way everyone was able to fall into different rhythms with the movie while watching it together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoments like T\u2019Challa\u2019s fight against M\u2019Baku atop Warrior Falls drew everyone together in support of the royal family, but you could sense a distinct divide grow in the audience as Erik Killmonger argued his case for an expansionist Wakanda. Every time the camera trained its focus on Michael B. Jordan (especially while he was shirtless), someone made a point of reminding everyone just what a vision he is to look at. But just moments later, someone on the opposite side of the theater never missed a chance to (lovingly) tut and suck their teeth in disapproval of Killmonger\u2019s extremism. Just as Black Panther was engaged in a very specific kind of dialogue with the audience, we were engaging with one another in real time\u2014a call-and-response of sorts about the story developing before our eyes.\n\nThere were more than a few scenes\u2014usually after one of Shuri\u2019s flawless zingers\u2014where the entire theater erupted into laughter that drowned out a few seconds of dialogue that no one could hear. In those moments, it didn\u2019t feel as if anyone was missing out on the movie but, rather, that as a collective, we all slipped into a comfortable familiarity with and understanding of one another that was more important than the specifics of the plot.\n\nBlack Panther\u2019s online hype is a force to be reckoned with, but it doesn\u2019t quite capture how profoundly moving it is to see rows full of little black girls and boys staring up in wonder at the Dora Milaje while they\u2019re kicking ass and taking names. They saw themselves on-screen in Black Panther\u2019s heroes and its villains, and I saw myself in them\u2014young and vibrant and inspired by the very idea of futuristic, distinctly African blackness destined to save the world from itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of this was exactly the case at the screening on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side that I attended later in the weekend. The lines were just as long and the excitement was still palpable, but the sense of togetherness and kinship was missing. There were no families posing in front of the Black Panther cardboard stand-ups with their arms proudly crossed in X\u2019s over their chests, or carefully placed kente cloth accents as part of people\u2019s ensembles. I enjoyed the movie all the same, but I couldn\u2019t help feeling as if something important was missing from the experience, and I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s something the theater could have replicated even if it wanted to.\n\nWakanda itself may not be a real place, but the magic and wonder that Black Panther presents to us is. It\u2019s the magic and wonder that all black people know we\u2019re more than capable of creating in the world when we come together and rally behind a cause, and it\u2019s something that can never be celebrated enough. That power and sense of connectedness is the narrative foundation upon which Black Panther is built, and it\u2019s something that\u2019s best experienced in the company of other black people.", "keywords": ["world", "saw", "sense", "black", "really", "movie", "panther", "way", "missing", "theater", "understand", "wonder"], "polarity": 0.14005586164677084, "subjectivity": 0.46970079583715924},

Would they use that generic African accent overused in Hollywood films? I looked to my left and right and wondered if the folks next to me were wondering the same things.\n\nHow would this superhero action flick \u201cuse\u201d the African characters?\n\nAfrica was not untouched by the Black Panther hype. It blew across over here ,too, with the winds stronger in some places, like in South Africa, Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe, where people there were paying close attention to actors of south and east African descent\u2014John Kani, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Daniel Kaluuya, Florence Kasumba and Danai Gurira.\n\nMany of us had seen the trailers featuring the stunning wardrobe and the spectacular special effects. We were curious to see this Dora Milaje, the all-female fighter guard assigned to protect the king and royal family. Many of us already knew that the Dora Milaje looked a lot like the Ahosi of Dahomey, aka the Dahomey \u201cAmazons,\u201d an all-female military guard formed in the late 17th century by King Wegbaja from the kingdom of Dahomey, and expanded by his son, King Agaja. We knew about the stellar cast and the mighty $200 million production budget, the most expensive movie directed by a black director with a mostly black cast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe knew these things, but still, what would the Africans, the black people, the Wakandans, look like? Many of us have grown tired of being sick and tired of how we are presented in Hollywood movies because the depictions often give the impression that Africans are backward. What would Wakanda look like?\n\nUgandan Lydia Namubiru, who saw the film in Kampala, Uganda\u2019s capital, said she went in with low expectations.\n\n\u201cMy first thought was that they are going to patronize us with stereotypes,\u201d she told The Root. \u201cEven going in, I was skeptical.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps it was a combination of measured curiosity and genuine excitement to see what could be something new in Hollywood storytelling about black people that partly drove untold numbers of people across Africa to cinemas over the past few days to catch the premiere.\n\nIn Ethiopia\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, the five daily screenings have been sold out at the sole theater showing the film. At the Accra Mall in Ghana, drummers came in beating out rhythms that heightened the crowd\u2019s enthusiasm. In Lagos, my fellow Nigerians were decked to the nines in gorgeous wax prints and chunky jewelry. In Kampala, attendants graced a cocktail hour before the premiere at the Acacia Mall.\n\nGoing out to the movies this time was like no other. This was a cultural occasion that was memorialized with selfies and social media posts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSenegal-based, Kenyan native and writer Ciku Kimeria dressed carefully in a chic, all-black assemble, and wrapped her long locks in bantu knots and adorned her neck with a colorful southern-African-inspired choker.\n\n\u201cThere was no way I was going to Wakanda just looking regular. I know black people and this is Senegal. I knew people were going to dress up,\u201d Kimeria told The Root.\n\nI joined friends and posed in front of the Black Panther poster, but I didn\u2019t know what would await me when I watched the film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, when the lights in the cinema hall dimmed, the silence took over the room and the screen lit up to a wide shot zooming in on massive cone-shaped buildings inspired by Sudano-Sahelian architecture; I knew something was happening. And I held my breath in wonder.\n\n\u201cI almost got up to clap \u2026 the hype is all worth it!\u201d Kimeria said.\n\nShe, too, was floored when she saw the architecture because it reminded her of a mosque building she had seen on a visit to the West African nation of Burkina Faso.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor many Africans, the film brought to the big screen a reality that they see everyday\u2014the Basotho blankets the warriors used as a protective shield, the queen\u2019s Zulu hat, the ochre-dyed locks of the Himba, the flowing fabrics of the Wolof. It was the sheer Pan-Africanism of it all that astounded me. The cinematic display of the diversity of African-ness was beautiful.\n\nFor some viewers, the film also represented a hope nurtured in the heart of what Africa could be. Ugandan sport radio journalist Patrick Kanyamozi told The Root that watching the film on the night it premiered in Uganda made him feel that he was part of history in the making.\n\n\u201cWhat we can learn from this film is that Africa has always had potential\u2014the gold, the diamonds and everything. It\u2019s only we were not able to work on that in the years that went by but still Africans individually can still pursue their dreams,\u201d Kanyamozi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe were humanized, and that matters,\u201d said 25-year-old Johannesburg-based South African journalist and filmmaker Sumeya Gasa. She said the whole experience was overwhelming and she is still trying to process it. \u201cIt\u2019s feels so good, too good.\u201d\n\nBut that \u201ctoo good\u201d feeling of Wakanda and what it could represent for black people in Africa and the Diaspora is what some people are trying to capture in their everyday lives. R.J. Mahdi is an Atlanta native who moved to Senegal years ago. He says that as an African American, he understood the character of the villainous N\u2019Jadaka, aka Killmonger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think Killmonger\u2019s character was an accurate depiction of the majority of black Americans feeling in one way or another. It was obviously symbolic, him being displaced from Wakanda. In retrospect, the majority of African Americans do feel that we have been abandoned in the world, and that\u2019s a tough feeling,\u201d Mahdi told The Root.\n\n\u201cWe hear it all the time. African Americans say \u2018Why didn\u2019t Africans come and fight for us in the civil rights movement or in the years of slavery?\u2019 I think that whenever you can bridge that gap and find a common ground, which was something that can happen, because even in the movie, it took them to find it out and learn each other\u2019s point of view to soften their heart towards each other in the end.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven Lydia Namubiru, the skeptical one, gave a positive review of the movie. She said she appreciated that it touched on the theme of the relationship between African Americans and Africans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe movie represented Africans\u2019 reaction to that radical Pan-Africanism that Killmonger had as just violence and just madness, as something crazy. I do feel like Killmonger being killed without properly understanding him was a pretty accurate depiction of how we react to radical Pan-Africanism,\u201d she told The Root.\n\nShe said she hopes the film will spark deeper conversations among Africans on how to do a better job of understanding black people in the Diaspora, particularly African Americans.\n\nIn the end, many viewers felt that the \u201cAfrican\u201d characters were humanized and nuanced, and there is a belief that this feeling of hope will be sustained and used as inspiration to channel the advancement of Africa. And for someone like me, who grew up being called \u201cAfrican booty scratcher\u201d and watching Africans as stock characters, I couldn\u2019t help but shed a tear at the end of the film, and I know that I was not the only one.", "keywords": ["hail", "going", "black", "audiences", "wakanda", "africans", "knew", "humanizing", "movie", "panther", "film", "characters", "told", "africa", "african"], "polarity": 0.054741522366522376, "subjectivity": 0.42516208791208787},

And with a personal income tax rate that sometimes reaches 57 percent, the city\u2019s population of 910,000 benefits equally from a strong infrastructure, free tertiary education and an aggressive stance on gender equality, right down to the 480 days of paid parental leave.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have never seen so many dads pushing babies around, without women, in my entire life. They did it in gym clothes, in jeans and in tailored business suits while holding cellphones to their ears. While eating at famed bakery Vete-Katten, I observed family after family divide feeding, burping and diaper-changing duty straight down the middle with military precision.\n\nIt was clear to me in less than a day that Swedes have that whole gender-equality thing down to a science.\n\n\u2026 But ethnic diversity is another thing altogether.\n\nTwenty-seven percent of the city\u2019s population comes from an immigrant or non-Swedish background, and the largest ethnic minorities include people from Finland, Iraq, Iran, Bosnia, Turkey, Croatia and Serbia\u2014with even smaller ethnic populations from a variety of East African countries. But for black people in America, being a minority isn\u2019t anything new. The question is, is Sweden really a great place, or is it just a great place for ethnic Swedes? The true nature of the city\u2019s culture of inclusivity and ethnic diversity is, unsurprisingly, best grasped by speaking to people of color who have made that migration themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSwedes make terrible strangers but great friends.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what Patrick Gibson says. The 69-year-old hospitality professional relocated to Stockholm from Barbados to be closer to his son, whose mother is Swedish. \u201cIf they don\u2019t know you, they\u2019ll just keep on walking \u2026 but once you\u2019re introduced and they\u2019re familiar with you, they\u2019re the best people to know,\u201d he adds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2011 he founded the Barbados-Sweden Cultural Association to address what he saw as a cultural void among Barbadian youths living in Sweden who wanted to reconnect with their roots. With his son in mind, Gibson made it a personal quest to examine the country\u2019s racial past, which is why he co-authored the book Svart i Sverige (\u201cBlack in Sweden\u201d).\n\nFascinated by the history of blacks in Sweden, in his book Gibson observes that much like other European countries, Sweden\u2019s past includes a chronicle of colonization, slave trading and the varied historical ways in which black people have contributed to modern Swedish culture, even if it isn\u2019t widespread public knowledge.\n\n\n\nWalking through a shopping center in Rinkeby, I observe the infinitely greater population of black people, women in Islamic dress and the use of non-Swedish languages. Gibson says that like many ethnically diverse neighborhoods, this one has a reputation for being dangerous\u2014though I never got that impression from my time there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSure, sometimes things happen,\u201d he says, \u201cbut sometimes things happen everywhere.\u201d He finds the neighborhood dynamic, family-oriented and stimulating. When asked if he\u2019s happy in his Scandinavian home, he doesn\u2019t hesitate for a moment: \u201cIt really is a great country.\u201d\n\nBut while modernity has certainly been good to Swedish families, the economy and the environment (which Gibson describes as the holy trinity of Swedish values), there are distinct elements of racism that remain tangible components of everyday Swedish life; but it\u2019s Swedish stoicism that prevents Afro-Swedes from articulating these grievances, suppressing a large part of their lived experiences from coming to light.\n\nThis is why programs like Melanin, a Swedish youth program that looks at the everyday lives of Afro-Swedes, has become so popular and is so important to changing the conversation on diversity and cultural inclusivity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere is a feeling of racism here, but nobody wants to talk about it because they want to be politically correct,\u201d says Azaa Ahmed Ali, 28, Melanin\u2019s program editor and diversity coordinator. \u201cPeople will tiptoe around you, but those microaggressions are constant.\u201d\n\n\n\nAli\u2019s family comes from Sudan, and they migrated to Stockholm when she was a small child. For her, the excitement generated by Melanin is a reflection of what has been missing in Swedish race dialogue, a conversation that she says is much more evolved in the U.S. because people aren\u2019t as concerned with appearing politically correct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAli says that when she was a teenager, she internalized popular images of Swedish beauty from TV and magazines, which didn\u2019t feature anyone who looked like her\u2014leading her to feel deeply insecure about the color of her skin and the texture of her hair, the constant subject of curiosity from other students.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s considered normal here is the white body, and what\u2019s considered normal here is the white culture,\u201d says Ali.\n\nThis makes sense when placed in context within Sweden\u2019s history. Despite its modern reputation as a liberal darling, it was only 1922 when the country established the National Institute of Racial Biology at Uppsala University, where objectives included experiments that divided people by race and involved genetically modifying the shapes of people\u2019s heads, a program later snatched up by Nazi Germany\u2019s eugenics program \u2026 in search of the perfect white body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Swedish convention dictates that pointing this out, or any racially charged subjects in general, regardless of how justified, is just a recipe for trouble.\n\n\u201cI definitely get called the angry black woman for bringing stuff up, reacting to comments,\u201d says Ali. It\u2019s a painfully familiar scenario that could take place anywhere in the U.S., but given the unspoken agreement among Swedes to live in overall denial of any racial tension, it should be no surprise that conflicts have been popping up in recent years.\n\nIn 2013 the Husby Riots, sparked by the police shooting of a 69-year-old Portuguese man, shook Stockholm\u2019s idyllic facade and awakened people to a brooding feeling of discontent among migrant and minority communities pushed to the outskirts of the city. It\u2019s there, says Ali, where they feel marginalized, invisible and suspicious of any police presence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt a gorgeous bar in Gamla Stan, with a view of the Royal Palace, some locals asked me about my impression of Sweden. I expressed my overall approval and, in turn, inquired about the riots. The question was quickly dismissed with a waved hand, and someone offered to buy me a beer instead. Up until then, I had been having a great time talking to strangers, eating semla and deciphering their incomprehensible language.\n\nBut it instantly reminded me of Azaa\u2019s final words: \u201cHey, the way America\u2019s going right now \u2026 I\u2019d say definitely come to Sweden \u2026 but be prepared to play by the rules.\u201d", "keywords": ["black", "program", "gibson", "ethnic", "question", "blaxit", "present", "diversity", "considering", "sweden", "great", "swedish", "stockholm"], "polarity": 0.1584084648134235, "subjectivity": 0.4473367082871216},

The hardest part was creating an entire country, more technologically advanced than anywhere on the planet, based around an indestructible super-metal that doesn\u2019t exist in the real world. The process started with a single question.\n\n\u201cOne of the questions [Coogler] was trying to ask and answer is what it means to be African in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,\u201d co-writer Joe Robert Cole told io9. \u201cWhich I think, in the back of your mind with this property, is always there.\u201d\n\nCole was one of the first people hired to make Black Panther, before even Coogler himself. He pitched a story to Marvel and had a treatment, but was sort of in a holding pattern until a director came on board.\n\n\u201cI knew I was not going to write the movie before there was a director on it,\u201d Cole said. \u201cI believe when they got into negotiating, [Coogler] saw [my treatment]. But then he had his own themes and ideas and vision for the movie. It was my job, at that point, to help him bring the movie he wanted to make [to life].\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce Coogler came on board and started writing with Cole, he brought in his own creative team as well. One of the key hires was production designer Hannah Beachler, who was tasked with figuring out what Wakanda looks like in the MCU. For her, the first question was simple but crucial: Where is Wakanda in Africa?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEven answering that question was a big question because [in Iron Man 2] there\u2019s a picture where of Wakanda on the map,\u201d Beachler told io9. \u201cAnd I said to Ryan, \u2018Is it there?\u2019 And we asked [Marvel Studios president] Kevin Feige, \u2018Is it there?\u2019 And he\u2019s like, \u2018I don\u2019t know, guys, where do you want it?\u2019\u201d\n\nThey decided on a a location on the Eastern part of the continent, below the Sahara desert. Once that was set, Beachler began researching cultures and tribes in that area, but that was just the first of many, many inspirations. She also looked at all eras of Black Panther comics, from Jack Kirby and Stan Lee in the \u201860s, to the Panther\u2019s Rage storyline of the \u201870s, all the way to the first storyline from the current run by Ta-Nehisi Coates and Brian Stelfreez. And while she blended elements from all of them, the original comics were particular helpful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI really wanted to spend time with the Jack Kirby designs because I wanted to understand that time period. What was going on in the world? What would he have known about Africa?\u201d Beachler said. She was fascinated thinking about how, at that time, those creators didn\u2019t have easy access to visual aids showing what Africa really looked like. What she found was they primarily used inspirations from the Timbuktu area of Mali, so those designs, coupled with superhero archetypes, were another source for her to draw from. \u201cIn that sense I am reaching back to the canon of it,\u201d Beachler said.\n\nCole, too, talked about going back to the canon of Black Panther when writing the script with Coogler. \u201cYou read all the comics. You look at the canon and you kind of extrapolate out,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat themes do you want to play with? What stories make sense? What\u2019s happening in the world? How do you bridge America with Africa? You just try to investigate ways to do that in character, in personal ways, so that they can resonate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComics and geography are only two of the elements that went into creating the country. Obviously, this Wakanda isn\u2019t in the \u201860s, it\u2019s now\u2014and since it\u2019s so technologically advanced beyond the rest of the modern world, Beachler\u2019s research also extended into future technology.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot about figuring out how many years in advance they were. A hundred years? Two hundred years? And in the end, we kind of settled on a number and then we started looking at tech that was coming,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cTED Talks and things like that. I talked to a lot of architects who were doing futuristic cities, who are designing Google cities, and anthropological architects, geologists. I did a lot of research on Elon Musk and his work with the Hyperloop. So all of that. Then you reach back into tradition, and I thought to myself \u2018How is it that this one specific thing evolved over time and became useful as a technology?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe \u201cone specific thing\u201d she\u2019s referring to is vibranium, a fictional substance which is Wakanda\u2019s most precious natural resource, and the key to the entire country. It drives everything there. Buildings, technology, clothes, culture\u2014it\u2019s all because of vibranium. The problem is, beyond being an unbreakable metal in Captain America\u2019s shield, there were no defined rules about it, even in the comics, where its properties had essentially mutated for decades. Both Cole and Beachler laughed when asked about defining what vibranium can and can\u2019t do and how that influenced the film itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was a process,\u201d Cole explained, \u201cbecause you\u2019re actually setting up the boundaries of what your story is and what this magical property is. And so we had a lot of discussions about, \u2018What can it do? What can\u2019t it do?\u2019 And some of it was discovering what we wanted the rules to be as we were discovering the story and what we needed it to be.\u201d\n\nFor Beachler it was even more tactile. \u201cThis is where the geologists came in,\u201d she said. \u201cI spent a lot of time figuring out the stages of vibranium because up until this point we\u2019ve really only seen it in Cap\u2019s shield. It has a very stainless steel look. So it looks like they have to mine it. That\u2019s where we started.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeachler also knew what the Black Panther suit was going to look like, which meant it was another dot to connect. \u201cSo I went through all of that research with vibranium,\u201d she said. \u201cLike, how does it go from this raw form to an ore to fabric to a stainless look, and then what does it look like when it\u2019s mined? That exists in the world. That was our foundation for everything.\u201d\n\nBut a foundation, by definition, is only a beginning. After the story was written and the world designed and built, there was still the casting, filming, editing, music, and so much more. The journey to get Black Panther on the big screen was a long one, but it started with the ambitious ideas of a few select people who were incredibly passionate about bringing this world to life.\n\n\u201cWe knew we wanted Wakanda to be a big character,\u201d Cole said. \u201cWe got to create this world and we wanted to root it as close to real-world Africa as possible. And so it was really world-building in its truest form.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Panther opens February 16.", "keywords": ["world", "creating", "wakanda", "black", "beachler", "panther", "vibranium", "process", "exhilarating", "coogler", "lot", "wanted", "complicated", "cole"], "polarity": 0.1521029814067789, "subjectivity": 0.44748481476329593},

People who were familiar with the comics were buzzing about which iteration would be translated to the big screen and how he would fit in with other characters, such as Captain America and Iron Man. Then, in 2016, Captain America: Civil War was released into cinemas worldwide and audiences went wild, as did I.\n\nHere we had two black men who were representative of the richest and most advanced nation on Earth: the father\u2014T\u2019Chaka, the king\u2014and his son T\u2019Challa. As the plot of Civil War advanced and T\u2019Challa interacted with the other characters, one thing remained constant: T\u2019Challa was constantly shown respect and, in some instances, deference because of his position as a king. The only person who seemed to forget to whom she was speaking was Natasha, but she learned quickly enough to mind her manners. Yes, I cackled with petty glee when the Dora Milaje security chief told Natasha to \u201cmove or be moved.\u201d But I digress.\n\nAs time drew closer to the Black Panther premiere, Marvel released more trailers, and in one of the promotional featurettes that serve to give viewers insight into the world of Wakanda, I heard this: \u201cWakanda\u2019s walls have been up since its inception; it\u2019s the best-kept secret in the world because they have something the world wants.\u201d And a revelation took shape.\n\nWhen I heard it, a thought that had been sitting in the back of my mind came to the forefront: that Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) and Everett K. Ross\u2019 (Martin Freeman) intention to find a way into Wakanda and take its resources for themselves is exactly what Europeans did to Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the moment Europeans learned to sail the open seas, they did it with one goal in mind: Conquer foreign lands and seize control of whatever resources they could get their hands on. Who cared if there were established societies with their own systems of government? They invaded, pillaged and decimated entire countries and their indigenous people, without a care for the destruction left in their wake. And it seems that this is exactly what Klaue and Ross intend to do.\n\nThey don\u2019t care that Wakanda is a sovereign nation with a thriving society that wants to be left alone. Like the English and Portuguese of yore, all Ross and Klaue care about is their own selfish need to take what they consider to be Wakanda\u2019s most vital resource, vibranium.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the Ottoman Empire successfully prevented European travelers from making significant inroads into continental Africa, forcing them to settle for exploring the coastal regions of Western Africa, as the Portuguese did in the 1400s. Eventually the Portuguese, French, Dutch and British made their way into the African interior, but it wasn\u2019t without significant resistance from native tribes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor centuries, African nations have had to defend their right to exist because white people and nonblack people of color believed that black people were less than, and unsophisticated \u201csavages\u201d who needed ruling. But instead of finding uneducated beings, Europeans were quite surprised to find a continent that was rich in more than minerals such as gold. They found people who had created governments, trade that spanned the Eastern Hemisphere, kingdoms with grand palaces and, most important, knowledge.\n\n\n\nSimilarly to countries like Egypt and empires like the Ottoman, Wakanda is a land unlike anywhere else because it is developing technologies advanced far beyond what the world knows, and it\u2019s mostly because of a young black girl, Shuri, who is the head of technology as well as T\u2019Challa\u2019s sister. As everyone in the West looks to Tony Stark as a pinnacle of intelligence, Shuri is creating technology that would make Tony blush in shame. For goodness\u2019 sake\u2014Shuri made it so that T\u2019Challa\u2019s panther suit automatically recharges by absorbing the kinetic energy from striking bullets. Your angsty fave could neva.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a saying that goes, \u201cThe most disrespected person in the world is a black woman,\u201d so it\u2019s quite interesting that in the MCU, the most intelligent person is a black woman. This is significant because in our society, black women are constantly denigrated while the work we accomplish is co-opted; we are insulted for our looks and fashion while nonblack people copy them without shame. And since appropriation is a trend that never seems to go out of style, we have two white men seeking to steal Shuri\u2019s technology in order to claim it as their own and turn it into a bastardized version as a means to bring destruction for their own selfish gains.\n\nLike the early colonizers who saw black people as \u201cless than\u201d simply because their skin was dark, and their hair and facial features not like white people\u2019s, Klaue and Ross see the Wakandans as people they can walk over, shoot through and push aside, simply because they don\u2019t view black people as individuals with rights and ownership of their home.\n\nInstead of approaching T\u2019Challa in peace and friendship, Klaue and Ross conspire to enter Wakanda through subterfuge so that they can learn the secrets that King T\u2019Chaka and the elders have protected for a millennium.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut like the Portuguese, Ross and Klaue will learn that black people\u2014particularly black women\u2014will fight tooth and nail to protect what\u2019s theirs. In Wakanda, there is a resisting force of warriors known as the Dora Milaje, and like Queen Nzinga of Ndongo (now known as Angola) and the legendary female Dahomean army, the Dora Milaje, led by their general, Okoye, and aided by Shuri\u2019s technology, will do what they must to protect their king and kingdom against all invaders because they have no other choice.\n\nThe way I see it, black people have always had to fight to hold on to what is rightfully ours, not only our land but our very identities. It\u2019s as though being black equates to having to struggle, especially when colonization comes into play. Even though slavery was abolished in the Caribbean and North America over 150 years ago, the impact is still felt today and affects the African Diaspora in myriad ways. One of those ways is our understanding of who we are as a people and as individuals. By that I mean knowing where we literally come from.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom an early age I knew what slavery was. I was taught about colonialism and its effects not just on Africa but also on the Caribbean. We learned that Barbados, as the easternmost island in the Caribbean chain, was the first port of call for slave ships. It was on the island that some of the most devastating and insidious characteristics of colonization were revealed.\n\nOnce the ships landed in port, those held in captivity were made to accept European names, their hair shaved and tribalwear stripped away. In essence, their very identity, along with their freedom, was stolen. Over time they were made to be ashamed of what made them distinguishable not only as Africans but also as a tribal people.\n\nA prime example of this effect was in how the slaves dressed. Gone were the colorful robes and beaded collars that identified them as belonging to a specific tribe, as well as their marital status and even age. Instead, our ancestors had to wear stiff cotton and bleached muslin. The women could no longer wear the traditional and intricate hairstyles; instead, they were forced to cover their heads in plain cloth, leading to insecurities that affect us to this day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the civil rights movement in the 1960s and \u201970s created an emergence of pride in and appreciation for African culture and traditions, black people in the Western world still have to contend with ignorance of our heritage from people of all walks of life and ethnicities. How often are black women insulted for the way we wear our hair, while white women are praised for being \u201ctrendy\u201d? How many stories are there about black people being snubbed for wearing traditional African clothing, only to see white models strutting down catwalks in imitations while designers like Stella McCartney get applauded?\n\nThough I\u2019ve always been proud of being black and having African ancestry, I didn\u2019t realize how much I longed to see my heritage on-screen until one Sunday night in 2017. Marvel had released the Black Panther teaser trailer, and the world, the collective black community, was shaken to our very core. And we\u2014I\u2014haven\u2019t been the same since.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Wakanda, there are people wearing their traditional garb with pride. Characters like Erik Killmonger are covered in tribal scarification, and there\u2019s an elder adorned with a lip plate as worn by the Mursi people of Ethiopia.\n\n\n\nAs someone who loves everything about film, I\u2019ve always felt bereft at not seeing enough positive representations of black people or of Africa herself in mainstream media. So the power of seeing a film of this magnitude, with the backing of one of the world\u2019s biggest film studios, centered on black people living in an \u201cAfrican\u201d nation, untouched by the destructive hands of colonizers, cannot be overstated. In one moment I realized that we, black people, were being given a major piece of the proverbial pie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo have one of the major plots of Black Panther be about a black king, his army of black women and his black sister fighting against two would-be white invaders and their goons is what I would call poetic justice. I can\u2019t wait to see the colonizers and interlopers be beaten at a game they never had a chance of winning this time.

Now, I happen to like it. It was well-acted and moving and is probably the second-best Marvel movie after Captain America: Winter Soldier, but that\u2019s just me. All black people don\u2019t have to like the Black Panther movie; people like different kinds of movies. just as they like different kinds of ice cream.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, what you can\u2019t do is be lactose-intolerant, walk into Cold Stone Creamery, complain that they didn\u2019t have a nondairy version of butter-cream confetti birthday cake, then write a thousand-word think piece on how the ice cream-industrial complex is misleading black folks.\n\nYet, like clockwork, late-night college-dorm cypher masquerading as revolutionary Twitter and blackademia are out in force saying that Erik Killmonger was right, that the Black Panther movie is anti-revolution and that the white dude got too much screen time. There are plenty of legitimate critiques of Black Panther, but these aren\u2019t those.\n\nLet\u2019s get the big one out of the way first: Killmonger wasn\u2019t right.\n\nI know that people are having #ExpressYourUnpopularOpinion orgasms on Twitter, and I get it; folks are out there hustling for contrarian hot takes on one of the most successful superhero films of all time to get clicks on their SoundCloud while blocking any disagreement. That\u2019s just social media. Doesn\u2019t mean that any of the critiques are right\u2014and most aren\u2019t.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nErik Killmonger (who is the best Marvel villain of all time, since Loki really doesn\u2019t count as a villain) defeats T\u2019Challa in ritual combat, takes over as king of Wakanda and Black Panther, and vows to use Wakanda\u2019s advanced weapons to arm oppressed black peoples all over the world.\n\nSome people found Killmonger\u2019s aims to be noble and that the Black Panther movie was overt propaganda against revolutionary politics. Or some academics felt that the movie demonized black American men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat black revolutionary thought are these folks reading?\n\nKillmonger\u2019s desire to free black people from oppression was noble, but his methods were ridiculous and his motives were questionable. Wakandans didn\u2019t resist Killmonger because of his ideas. They didn\u2019t agree with his methods, which were\u2014again\u2014ridiculous.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack revolution in America hasn\u2019t failed because we don\u2019t have enough guns; it fails because white folks outnumber us 10 to 1, and that\u2019s in some major metropolitan areas.\n\nWeapons for self-defense or chasing the cops and the Ku Klux Klan out of your neighborhood are one thing, but going to war against the United States would mean the extermination of black people, no matter how many vibranium-shielded rhinos you shipped to Ferguson, Mo.\n\nNow, if Killmonger had wanted to turn Wakanda into a refuge for oppressed blacks across the globe, or bankrupt the imperialist powers in Europe and America by creating a single African currency based on vibranium, I\u2019m pretty sure T\u2019Challa would have at least been willing to check out a PowerPoint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThing is, though, Killmonger didn\u2019t have a good plan, no matter how his supporters try to spin it. More important, Killmonger\u2019s plan wasn\u2019t intentionally bad because film director Ryan Coogler wanted to discredit revolution; it was bad because there are still a lot of people dumb enough to think that black freedom in America can be achieved through direct combat. Peaceful Black Lives Matter activists get shot on the daily. What do you think would happen to a militarized black uprising?\n\nSpeaking of militancy, the notion that Black Panther is propaganda for incrementalist reform instead of wide-scale revolution can occur to you only if you didn\u2019t watch the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWakandans are part of a never colonized, ethnocentric, isolationist, theocratic monarchy. In other words, the country is run by a royal family that worships a magical cat, and they don\u2019t care about anybody or anything beyond their borders, regardless of race. Heck, M\u2019Baku points out that no Black Panther had visited Jabari-Land for a thousand years, and that was like a 15-minute Hoverbike trip from Panther Palace.\n\nHow would it make sense in this movie for this nation to move from isolationists to Pan-African revolutionaries in a few hours just because a guy dressed like Lil Fizz from B2K showed up with some fighting skills and a tattoo on his lip?\n\nKillmonger wants revolution, but only if he is in charge. W\u2019Kabi wants imperialism, and Nakia wants humanitarianism, and T\u2019Challa is figuring out how to move Wakanda forward and how to get his girl back. Which brings us to the white man in the middle, Agent Ross. Some critics felt the need to center him in the movie, and it\u2019s snarky and sloppy pop-culture commentary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only reason Agent Ross is in Wakanda is that he took a bullet for the girl the king is sweating. Notice that the Wakandas weren\u2019t sharing Kimoyo beads with all those dead South Koreans lying around after Killmonger freed Klaue. After that, they called Ross \u201ccolonizer,\u201d locked him in a room, and when he volunteered to help overthrow Killmonger, Shuri, T\u2019Challa and Nakia gave him the collective, \u201cOh, you\u2019re still here?\u201d look.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Wakandans never trusted, embraced or fully accepted Agent Ross; he was caught up in a palace coup and proved to be useful. If you think Black Panther spent too much time on or gave too much focus to Ross, you probably think Get Out was really about Detective LaToya and the inner workings of the Transportation Security Administration, aka the TSA.\n\nHollywood doesn\u2019t make revolutionary movies, and even movies that \u201clook\u201d revolutionary are really status quo propaganda. In every Planet of the Apes movie, the monkeys that want justice and revenge on humanity, even after years of being experimented on and oppressed, are always the bad guys. In the X-Men movies, even though Magneto is right every. single. time., he\u2019s the bad guy. In Django Unchained, despite being a former slave himself, Django cares nothing about freeing others; all he wants is to get his wife back.\n\nIn other words, Hollywood movies only say violent revolution is OK if the oppressors are robots or aliens that we can\u2019t have sex with (notice why they had so much trouble in Battlestar Galactica?).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, none of these critiques apply to Black Panther. The movie isn\u2019t anti-revolution; it\u2019s about the best way for black people to carry out our obligations to one another, wrapped up in a coup and a bunch of computer-generated images and fancy costumes.\n\nKillmonger\u2019s goal was noble, but his methods were nonsense and ahistorical. Let\u2019s save the concern-trolling think pieces until the next Tyler Perry movie; those movies are much more worthy candidates for this kind of scorn.", "keywords": ["wrong", "revolution", "black", "didnt", "yall", "ross", "movie", "know", "panther", "revolutionary", "think", "killmonger", "movies"], "polarity": 0.025088763575605678, "subjectivity": 0.44868072960178224},

Did you go in on all of your favorites when you went home for the holidays, as if mini marshmallows only exist within a 1-mile radius of your parents\u2019 home \u2026 for three days of the year?\n\nDid you try the corn-pudding recipe from the founder of the James Hemings Foundation, Chef Ashbell McElveen, in the first installment of this series? It is a sweet homage to our industrious ancestors who added milk and eggs to Native American simple corn mash. Or, perhaps, did Chef Alexander Smalls\u2019 turkey recipe, inspired by the West African favorite, yassa chicken, whet your whistle? You\u2019ve plenty of time to turn your turkey game on its \u201cpope\u2019s nose\u201d before Christmas!\n\nIf Thanksgiving wasn\u2019t your jam to bring the African Diaspora to the table, let me try, try again. Fortunately, we have a built-in annual seven-day celebration that can assist us to this end. That\u2019s right, I am talking about the somewhat maligned African-American-created celebration of Kwanzaa.\n\nOther than my love of saying the word \u201cKujichagulia\u201d for its rhythmic cadence (which I used when singing the theme song of Welcome Back Kotter before I knew the real lyrics), Kwanzaa seems like the giftless black cousin to Hanukkah, replete with a daily candle-lighting ceremony. However, Kwanzaa\u2019s principles and the celebration of Pan-African foods can be an impactful unifier for all, some of which might already be incorporated into your current Christmas celebration.\n\nFor help with this assignment, I asked food historian Tonya Hopkins, co-founder of the James Hemings Foundation, about gateway Kwanzaa foods and principles and the Pan-African dishes we can bring to our holiday tables. She suggests that Kwanzaa\u2019s principles and the foods accompanying them can serve as a salve for all that transpired in the past year and all that is to come in the New Year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe very word \u2018Kwanzaa,\u2019 derived from a Swahili phrase, means \u2018first fruits of the harvest\u2019 and calls on the indigenous African foodstuffs and those introduced to the Americas from Africa,\u201d she writes in her 2014 Oxford Encyclopedia of Food & Drink in America entry.\n\nFrom an African basket or wooden bowl of fruits and vegetables to the passing of a unity cup filled with libations for the ancestors, Hopkins says, \u201cFood imagery is woven throughout the fabric of the holiday and shows up prominently on the Kwanzaa table.\u201d\n\nWhile there is no set menu, it is customary to serve dishes using native African ingredients like black-eyed peas, yams, leafy greens, rice, chilies, peppers and more. Already sounding familiar, eh? Then hold on to your buttermilk biscuits, because they, along with myriad other breads we love\u2014fish, shellfish and poultry, hearty stews and one-pot dishes, along with fruit-based drinks and desserts\u2014can all be celebrated over the seven days of Kwanzaa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have enjoyed most if not all of the foods of Kwanzaa on our Christmas tables and beyond, but I wanted to go deeper to uncover some of these Pan-African universal food truths. I headed over to meet my friend and co-owner of LoLo\u2019s Seafood Shack in Harlem, Chef Raymond Zamanta Mohan, to ask him what was prepared during Christmas back in his Caribbean home country of Guyana.\n\nChef Mohan began reminiscing fondly, starting one week before Christmas, when all of the fruit-filled rum cakes were baked and beverages made, including sorrel, mauby and ginger beer:\n\n\n\nChef Raymond Zamanta Mohan\u2019s Ginger Beer\n\n1 pound fresh ginger, grated or processed in a blender\n\n2 gallons water\n\n1 pound brown sugar\n\n5 cloves\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBring all ingredients to simmer and let sit overnight at room temperature. Stir the mixture and serve over ice. Keep refrigerated thereafter.\n\nHe quickly mentions baked chicken, but by the time he rounds the corner to his favorite dish of souse, he says, \u201cMy mouth is watering \u2026 I want some.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is a collagen soup historically made from unwanted animal parts like the feet, head and tail. Much like the beginnings of my Louisiana grandmother\u2019s cold hogshead cheese, souse is cooked for hours until it falls apart and is served hot with fresh lime, onions and chili peppers. His affinity for souse carries over to the Guyanese pepper pot, too, where molasses is added to the cooking process, yielding a sweet and spicy dish that is served with homemade bread.\n\nAnd there it is \u2026 Chef Mohan, like most of us, unknowingly hit all of the Kwanzaa food markers: one-pot dishes, bread, fruit-based drinks and desserts, poultry and so much more. I say keep doing what you do, and now, with your Pan-African family in mind\u2014and, as Tonya Hopkins suggests\u2014meditate on one of the seven principles each day of Kwanzaa to become more mindful and present during the holiday season.\n\nMerry Christmas and happy Kwanzaa to all, and to all \u2026 Kujichagulia!

Before he went on to make Blade, Wesley Snipes campaigned long and hard to get the ball rolling on a live-action Black Panther adaptation in which he would have starred. Though the project never quite came to fruition, Snipes\u2019 description of that \u201890s Black Panther film is a fascinating taste of what might have been.\n\n\n\nSnipes spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about how his own Black Panther project actually got much farther along in the production process than most people realize (if they knew about it at all). Multiple scripts were written, Snipes himself (who was a hot commodity throughout the early-to-mid \u201890s) was attached to star, and both Mario Van Peebles and John Singleton were in the running to direct.\n\nBut for all the potential Snipes\u2019 Panther might have had, comic books and movies based on them didn\u2019t have the same kind of cultural cache and relevance that they do today and not everyone was on board with the idea of sticking close to the source material. Though Snipes felt it was important to emphasize Wakanda\u2019s technological prowess\u2014something we\u2019ll definitely be seeing in Marvel\u2019s film\u2014others, like Singleton, thought it would be smarter to go in a different direction:\n\n\u201cJohn was like, \u2018Nah! Hah! Hah! See, he\u2019s got the spirit of the Black Panther, but he is trying to get his son to join the [civil rights activist] organization. And he and his son have a problem, and they have some strife because he is trying to be politically correct and his son wants to be a knucklehead.\u2019 \u201c I am loosely paraphrasing our conversation. But ultimately, John wanted to take the character and put him in the civil rights movement. And I\u2019m like, \u2018Dude! Where\u2019s the toys?! They are highly technically advanced, and it will be fantastic to see Africa in this light opposed to how Africa is typically portrayed.\u2019 I wanted to see the glory and the beautiful Africa. The jewel Africa.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSnipes also described a number of other angles for the film that would have focused on a version of T\u2019Challa who didn\u2019t grow up in Wakanda in the years before he became king. As odd as that may sound, bear in mind that the \u201890s were a very, very different time for Marvel and Black Panther. At the time, Marvel had recently sold off the film rights to a number of its characters in an attempt to stave off its impending bankruptcy.\n\nEven though Columbia Pictures was interested in potentially producing Snipes\u2019 Black Panther, technological and budgetary constraints proved to be insurmountable issues. CGI wasn\u2019t anything close to what it\u2019s like today and capturing the sheer grandeur of Wakanda would have called for a gargantuan budget. It\u2019s nice to think that there was almost an OG Black Panther film that we could have been looking back on with fondness (or derision, who knows) for years, but to hear the way Snipes describes his vision for T\u2019Challa\u2019s vibranium suit, perhaps it\u2019s best the movie never got made:\n\n\u201cActually, I figured it would be a leotard. A leotard with maybe some little cat ears on it. I would have to be in shape and just be straight bodied up.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter]", "keywords": ["90s", "snipes", "project", "civil", "black", "featured", "son", "wakanda", "panther", "film", "africa", "movement", "wanted", "rights", "wesley", "reveals"], "polarity": 0.1213378442545109, "subjectivity": 0.4921153846153847},

There were thriving and ideologically diverse cities surrounded by expansive and bucolic countrysides. There was modern technology perfectly weaved into cultural tradition, a melding that was symbiotic instead of antagonistic. And while I didn\u2019t see this happening during the movie, I\u2019m sure Wakanda has amazing bottomless brunches.\n\nUnfortunately, a present-day attempt to re-create Wakanda would be unrealistic. Mainly because we\u2019re roughly 20,000 years behind Wakandan tech. And mostly because we\u2019re too infected with colonization and its myriad residues and peripheral effects. Also, we\u2019re a little short on vibranium.\n\nOne thing, however, that we can and definitely should start doing is what M\u2019Baku and his Que Dog Jabari tribe did when encountering a problematic white dude who was speaking when there was no ask or need or purpose for the thoughts and opinions of problematic white dudes.\n\nBark.\n\nNot a purposeless bark. This isn\u2019t a shih tzu barking through the window at a squirrel. Instead, this would be an intentional bark. A targeted bark. An overpowering bark. A drowning bark. A Wakandan bark.

A purse is clutched when you walk on an elevator? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! (If they\u2019re going to act scared, you might as well give them a reason to be.)\n\nOf course, this barking will take some practice. They can\u2019t be small-dog barks, so people with higher and/or softer voices will probably have to do some training. Which is why, today, I\u2019m announcing the opening of the M\u2019Baku School of Wakandan White Silencing.

The portraits, by Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald respectively\u2014both black painters\u2014are such sharp departures from any previous depictions of a president and first lady that reviews were understandably mixed, even among our own crew here at The Root (including yours truly).\n\nEspecially in considering Michelle Obama\u2019s portrait, it took a moment to reconcile her portrayal with our expectations. Where was the warmth we\u2019d become so accustomed to during the Obama era? The radiant smile? The glorious brown skin?\n\nWhile Wiley\u2019s portrait of our 44th president\u2019s portrait seemed lush and even playful\u2014if whimsically unconventional for a leader of the free world\u2014Sherald\u2019s portrait of his wife, posed similarly to Rodin\u2019s The Thinker, seemed to almost recede by comparison, like a cherished photograph that had already faded much too soon for our comfort. To some of us, it seemed more like a suggestion of our favorite first lady, rather than a portrait of the lady herself.\n\nAnd yet, in the days since\u2014for this writer, at least\u2014it has been difficult not to return to look at it again and again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Doreen St. Felix wrote in a wonderful analysis for the New Yorker:\n\nThe racializing schema of Sherald\u2019s work is to \u201cexclude the idea of color as race,\u201d she has said, in her artist\u2019s statement. To Sherald, the photorealistic depiction of race\u2014a quality determined by others\u2019 eyes, externally\u2014is a dead end. Applied to Michelle Obama, the lack of brown in the skin feels first like a loss, and then like a real gain. This is a different Michelle, a woman evacuated of celebrity, who appears provisionally dreamlike, nearly a shadow. The mouth and the eyes and the strong arms that we know are present, but fainter. From some distance, I can imagine, the figure might not be immediately recognizable.\n\nOf the many things that have been written about Michelle Obama\u2019s portrait since its unveiling just over a week ago, several articles have focused on the dress she chose to be immortalized in, one made by American (semi-)affordable luxury label Milly, designed by Michelle Smith. Indeed, it is the most visually striking element of the portrait, featuring graphic-patterned patches in black, red, yellow, pink and beige, scattered across the white foreground of the skirt. It drapes across Obama\u2019s lap in much the same way I remember quilts draping across my Mississippian great-grandmother\u2019s lap decades ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany have been quick to make the same comparison, especially noting similarities between Obama\u2019s dress and the famously graphic geometric quilts created for over a century in Gee\u2019s Bend, Ala. At the unveiling, artist Amy Sherald spoke to the similarities herself, saying:\n\nThe dress chosen for this painting was designed by Milly. It has an abstract pattern that reminded me of the Dutch artist Piet Mondrian\u2019s geometric paintings. But Milly\u2019s design also resembles the inspired quilt masterpieces made by the women of Gee\u2019s Bend, a small remote black community in Alabama where they compose quilts in geometries that transform clothes and fabric remnants into masterpieces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut designer Smith apparently had no such correlation in mind when she created the print. She spoke to Vogue about the dress, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s made of a stretch cotton poplin print in a clean, minimal, geometric print without a reference to anything past or nostalgic, which gives the dress a very forward-thinking sensibility\u2014this is very Michelle Obama.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut while Smith may not have read a metaphor for quilting in her own work, is it safe for her to assume that a woman as aware and astute as Michelle Obama\u2014well known for her strategic sartorial statements\u2014didn\u2019t? Aside from evoking the great Southern tradition of quilting\u2014as well as the Stars and Stripes famously hand-sewn for this country\u2014is it so outlandish to consider that her gown might also evoke the racial patchwork that makes up the country her husband so recently led?\n\nTo glean more insight, The Glow Up spoke with textile artist, clothing designer, children\u2019s book author and illustrator, and master quilter Cozbi Cabrera, a 2017 Lincoln Center artist-in-residence whose own quilts have been shown at the Myrtle Beach Art Museum, concurrent with an exhibit on the quilters of Gee\u2019s Bend. Like many others, she isn\u2019t so quick to discredit the correlation between the white American designer dress and the black American South:\n\nWell, I think for starters that designers have to be aware that they are influenced greatly, and that fashion overall is derivative. So, whether we are doing it consciously or subconsciously, there is something about putting all of these elements together that\u2019s going to strike a chord or trigger a memory or something. So, I think that she\u2019s probably not being\u2014I wouldn\u2019t even use the word \u201ctruthful\u201d\u2014I think that she\u2019s probably not being aware of this idea that fashion is derivative. So, it comes from somewhere. And I think that rightfully so, [Amy Sherald\u2019s] notion of her choice is very telling as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCabrera is also quick to note the very \u201cAmerican story\u201d of Gee\u2019s Bend, an isolated peninsula about 35 miles southwest of Selma, Ala., with a population of less than 300, according to the 2010 census. In 1965, Martin Luther King Jr. visited the enclave\u2014primarily African American and reachable almost exclusively by ferry\u2014three weeks before Selma\u2019s \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d to encourage voter registration. However, three years before, Alabama\u2019s government had shut down ferry service to nearby Camden, further isolating the community from basic necessities like medical attention, employment and participation in the democratic process.\n\nAnd yet, even in isolation, their traditions continued. In 2002, the Whitney Museum in New York City mounted a show of the quilts of Gee\u2019s Bend, to rave reviews. The New York Times\u2019 art critic called them \u201ceye-poppingly gorgeous,\u201d while others marveled at the fact that these modernist creations could have generated within a place seemingly cut off from inspiration, as Cabrera notes:\n\n[T]heir quilts showed up at the Whitney Museum in New York, and the reviews came back that what they were doing rivaled anything that you\u2019d find in 20th-century art. ... how could it be? How could they have these sophisticated influences if they were in isolation? And it\u2019s almost like an assumption that the Creator\u2014or what I would call the Divine\u2014sort of sprinkles sophistication and aesthetic instincts only on a particular group of people, in only a particular geographic location, you know?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilarly, Cabrera believes it may be shortsighted to underestimate the deep significance and skill in Sherald\u2019s portrait of Michelle Obama\u2014or to assume the former first lady\u2019s intentions in choosing her for the commission. Because, ultimately, isn\u2019t art\u2014like beauty\u2014in the eye of the beholder? Said Cabrera:\n\nI think that in a less masterful hand, most people have a tendency to kind of throw in the kitchen sink, and in my mind, [Sherald] made some very deliberate choices as to what to leave out, and what was left was the likeness of Michelle Obama. So we got that it was her\u2014you know it was quite a bit of fluidity of line, and then these elements of patch. All that\u2019s left in my mind visually were the essentials to kind of like, tell the story. How [Milly designer Michelle Smith] might feel about that, I think it\u2019s almost not even relevant because I think that the larger community got what was being communicated. And so, I think that\u2019s why you keep hearing, again and again, this notion of [the] quilt. I think that there\u2019s a language that we all understand, and that\u2019s what you get with people groups; like the things that don\u2019t have to be spoken but are understood. ... It\u2019s not uncanny that the community is saying similar things along a similar vein, because we do have this common understanding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those of us who, at first glance, might have wanted something more colorful and dramatic for our first black first lady, perhaps it\u2019s worth taking a beat, and considering who Michelle Obama really is, as Cabrera\u2019s deft analysis reminds us: \u201cTo me, it\u2019s the visual equivalent of a stage whisper, which draws more attention to itself.\u201d", "keywords": ["included", "black", "gees", "obama", "quilts", "lady", "picture", "think", "dress", "portrait", "bend", "michelle"], "polarity": 0.14501168400422132, "subjectivity": 0.4232492838836122},

There were thriving and ideologically diverse cities surrounded by expansive and bucolic countrysides. There was modern technology perfectly weaved into cultural tradition, a melding that was symbiotic instead of antagonistic. And while I didn\u2019t see this happening during the movie, I\u2019m sure Wakanda has amazing bottomless brunches.\n\nUnfortunately, a present-day attempt to re-create Wakanda would be unrealistic. Mainly because we\u2019re roughly 20,000 years behind Wakandan tech. And mostly because we\u2019re too infected with colonization and its myriad residues and peripheral effects. Also, we\u2019re a little short on vibranium.\n\nOne thing, however, that we can and definitely should start doing is what M\u2019Baku and his Que Dog Jabari tribe did when encountering a problematic white dude who was speaking when there was no ask or need or purpose for the thoughts and opinions of problematic white dudes.\n\nBark.\n\nNot a purposeless bark. This isn\u2019t a shih tzu barking through the window at a squirrel. Instead, this would be an intentional bark. A targeted bark. An overpowering bark. A drowning bark. A Wakandan bark. A bark meant to communicate, \u201cUm, who told you that you can speak? When it is time for your words, we will let you know. And maybe that time will never come. We\u2019ll see. Now, just shut up and stand there. Maybe get on your phone and Google \u2018How not to be a colonizer.\u2019 Whatever you do, I want to hear you not speaking.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bark doesn\u2019t just have to be a counter for useless words, either. A wayward white hand reaches for your hair? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! A group of white people huddled on a sidewalk refuse to step aside when you attempt to walk past them? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! A purse is clutched when you walk on an elevator? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! (If they\u2019re going to act scared, you might as well give them a reason to be.)\n\nOf course, this barking will take some practice. They can\u2019t be small-dog barks, so people with higher and/or softer voices will probably have to do some training. Which is why, today, I\u2019m announcing the opening of the M\u2019Baku School of Wakandan White Silencing. The classes will be free, so no worries about me using GoFundMe monies for Bigen and creatine.\n\n\n\n(Sidenote: Also, the bark was actually an ape grunt.

Having grown up on the outskirts of Washington, D.C., formerly known as Chocolate City, attended an HBCU and worked at two black companies in the past, I\u2019ve been happily surrounded by myriad black people.\n\nRecently, that\u2019s included black Americans who\u2019ve relocated to the Lower 48 from other areas, such as Ghana, Cape Verde, Nigeria and regions in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Given that they have lived here for the majority of their lives, it\u2019s no surprise that we have more in common than not. However, during one enlightening Uber ride steered by an Afghan driver, I was left feeling like an outsider among people with diverse backgrounds, with knowledge of their ancestral traditions, exotic cultures, food and languages\u2014people who knew and embraced their ethnic origins in a way that most U.S.-born African Americans have been denied.\n\nWhile they took advantage of the hourlong ride to play music from their homelands and share tidbits about their regions, I had little to offer to the conversation. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have a culture, but my usual pride was replaced with something else, and I tried to think of something to share with them about being uniquely African American that wasn\u2019t rooted in slavery.\n\nThe soul food our great-grandmothers made, created out of necessity often with the parts of animals and plants that others discarded. The R&B and jazz, evolved from Negro spirituals, which others appropriate. The braids, Afros and press-and-curl hairstyles that either distinguished us or aided us in assimilating for increased opportunities and acceptance. Though they\u2019re the product of a resilient people whose struggle to survive exceeded their limitations, when it comes to African-American culture, the story often begins with enslavement.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what they teach you in school,\u201d said Mary Elliott, a curator at the National Museum of African American History and Culture, scheduled to open Sept. 24. However, much of what we consider American pop culture or African-American culture has its roots in Africa, she said: \u201cThere are things that we have in plain sight that we don\u2019t even realize they tie back to some of these cultural practices.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen enslaved men and women were brought to America, they brought skills and trades, such as farming and agriculture, with them. \u201cThere are African Americans who that was passed down [to] through their families. We received rations and limited types of food, but we grew our own vegetables. We cooked the okra. We found ways to eat healthy,\u201d she said.\n\nElliott shared the story of an African art scholar who filmed a dance practice popular among Cuba\u2019s people of African descent. He recognized the art form and showed it to people living in Africa, who also recognized it. \u201cThat dance and practice had been carried over and passed down to the generations. The people in Cuba didn\u2019t know they had been doing something that had its origins in Africa,\u201d she said.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s pride in knowing and recognizing that parts of our African culture have beaten the odds and somehow survived centuries to exist in today\u2019s society; however, Elliott said, there\u2019s just as much pride to be felt about those things that were birthed in slavery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile you might not feel chitlins are something to brag about, she noted, \u201cIf all you had was the scraps, you did what you had to. We found a way to make it work. Those are the things that we need to remember. That\u2019s the stuff to think about.\u201d\n\nNot only did African Americans create a significant culture here, but it\u2019s become so ingrained in the DNA of the country that some don\u2019t recognize how much our ancestors contributed. I neglected to join in the conversation that day and share aspects of African-American culture, in part, because I figured my companions were already aware. Surely, they didn\u2019t need me to tell them about African-American music genres, cuisine or language. They aren\u2019t new to the country.\n\nHowever, when one Jamaican-born American later shared the opinion that black Americans \u201cdon\u2019t have a culture,\u201d I realized that just as I had plenty to learn about their cultures, I could have enlightened someone by sharing aspects of mine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat I believed was common knowledge about how America\u2019s music, food, dance, literature and art have all been heavily influenced by black Americans wasn\u2019t. Our contributions to what\u2019s now considered mainstream culture are sometimes lost and overlooked, not just by \u201cothers,\u201d but also by black Americans, who, according to Elliott, share a lot with those blacks from other regions.\n\n\u201cPeople can say, \u2018I\u2019m from Senegal. I\u2019m from Guyana,\u2019 but we\u2019re all connected to the Diaspora,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s something to say about having a connection to what people call a homeland.\u201d\n\nThough we may have been born on different continents, Elliott said, it\u2019s that bond to Africa that keeps us connected, even on those rare occasions when our differences seem greater than our similarities. So while black Americans from other areas have traditions and cultures that reflect their countries of origin, the centuries-long culture of African Americans isn\u2019t any less significant, relevant or influential.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t discredit the working in the field, the toiling of the land, the raising other people\u2019s family. That laid the groundwork for all of this,\u201d said Elliott, who is proud that her ancestors were able to endure and eventually thrive. \u201cI say my home is this place, the U.S. My family built this place.\u201d", "keywords": ["black", "food", "defending", "way", "elliott", "culture", "making", "dont", "american", "african", "americans", "africanamerican", "share"], "polarity": 0.08058386443803112, "subjectivity": 0.3781881313131313},

Something about a nerdtastic property holding such cultural significance put me in a state of bliss. So I made a return trip, you know, to make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything. (Yeah, sure. That\u2019s the only reason.)\n\n\n\nDuring the second viewing, something occurred to me regarding Erik \u201cI Shouldn\u2019t Like You as Much as I Do\u201d Stevens, aka Killmonger. I hesitate to call him a villain. A villain drudges up images of some huge, purple-skinned menace trying to fetch some mystical stones, a threat so powerful that the next Marvel installment, Avengers: Infinity War, must be divided into two parts.\n\nKillmonger is more of an adversary, an antagonist you feel for because his motives are all too real. Black folks can relate to being done with the world\u2019s bullshit, and I can guarantee that some of us left the theater wondering what we\u2019d do if we had access to all of Wakanda\u2019s resources. Klaue? He can go die in a fire for stealing our stuff and calling us \u201csavages,\u201d but you not so secretly hope that Killmonger and T\u2019Challa will come together, especially when you realize that Black Panther isn\u2019t just peak Afrofuturism; it\u2019s also revisionist history.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel is no stranger to telling a story within the context of actual historical events; just think (\u201cO Captain, My Captain\u201d) America, with his patriotic shield and penchant for punching Nazis. It adds a fantastic layer to these otherworldly stories\u2014the knowledge of some grand superpower existing during our darkest hours. That\u2019s what Captain America stood for; even before the super-soldier program, Steve Rogers was full of heart and optimism, a little guy who wanted to help the little guy.\n\nBut it\u2019s much easier for an all-American white soldier to take a chance than for an African king. This time around, I peeped them slave ships in that opening narration, so don\u2019t expect the Black Panther to jump at the chance to help the good ol\u2019 U.S. of \u201cAye, we\u2019re gonna enslave your people and take them to this stolen land\u2014we mean, shared equally with the natives\u2014happy Thanksgiving.\u201d\n\nStill, that\u2019s Killmonger\u2019s entire beef with the Wakandans. They\u2019ve had every opportunity to help black folks, but chose to stay hidden. King T\u2019Chaka was so set on this that he killed his own brother\u2014and Killmonger\u2019s father\u2014N\u2019Jobu. That is classic revenge motivation, but it becomes more complex (and tragic) when you realize what was happening back in 1992, the year Killmonger was orphaned by his own people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from the fact that it\u2019s close to director Ryan Coogler\u2019s hometown of Richmond, Calif., on the surface, Oakland, Calif., in 1992 doesn\u2019t seem too significant. During my first viewing of the movie, I thought they were simply pulling a Civil War, which recalled the date when Tony Starks\u2019 parents were killed.\n\nBut while the opening of Black Panther is a variation on this theme, when Zuri later tells the story to T\u2019Challa, we see N\u2019Jobu pleading with his brother to help their black American brethren fight violence and over-policing, everything we, the people of 2018, know to have been a harsh reality for generations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomething about \u201cover-policing\u201d and \u201c1992\u201d stuck with me after my second viewing of Black Panther, so I relied on my good friend Google to uncover what was in the back of my mind.\n\n1992 is when the Los Angeles riots took place. Rodney King, y\u2019all. Yes, in addition to everything else, Black Panther went there.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, the riots didn\u2019t take place in Oakland, but you best believe the character of N\u2019Jobu would\u2019ve heard about them. Leaving your black utopian society to learn about the police, the supposed protectors of the country you\u2019re surveilling, beating the shit out of a black man? And getting away with it? N\u2019Jobu was in America during one of the most well-publicized atrocities toward the black community.\n\n\n\nImagine living in Wakanda, a world where black folks are treated with love and respect, then being sent out and bearing witness to Rodney-fucking-King. The riots could easily have been the tipping point, the moment N\u2019Jobu decided that his people needed to do something. It was certainly better than the alternative: the riots happening after his death, leaving his son\u2014who would ultimately become Killmonger\u2014alone to deal with it. It certainly makes little Erik\u2019s line about everyone dying around them more heartbreaking, especially since he sheds no tears.\n\nAs a man, however, Erik Stevens/Killmonger does cry, because he realizes what he\u2019s become as he sits in the ancestral plane with his father. And even among all that violence and death, N\u2019Jobu still had dreams of showing his son life as it could be in Wakanda. He wanted to bring his son home\u2014or, perhaps, he wanted to create that home in our country. Witnessing the power of Vibranium in this narrative, that single stolen vial could\u2019ve started a revolution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo here is your villain/anti-hero: Erik Killmonger, left fatherless in a world full of so-called protectors who abuse his brethren. He\u2019d grow up to see more men, women and children go through the same ordeal as or worse than Rodney King\u2019s, only to become social media hashtags. He\u2019d grow up hearing us tell wistful stories of \u201cthe Motherland,\u201d while simultaneously dealing with white folks telling us to \u201cgo back to Africa,\u201d as if we chose to be here in the first place.\n\nAnd yet Killmonger would also know that his family in that far-off prosperous land would kill one of their own to keep their land and resources safe, only to later sign the Sokovia Accords to police those with superpowers. So he decided that he\u2019d create \u201cthe Motherland\u201d for himself and for us. Villain or not, Killmonger was willing to start from the ground up to let them know who we are.

She could afford to take her time, looking over different parts before agreeing to the one she thought would be best for her career.

(Credit: ABC News)\n\nHow Supremacist Trolls Spread Rumors to Media\n\n\u201cFollowing misrepresentations by a white nationalist leader and coordinated efforts by internet trolls, numerous researchers and media outlets spread a seemingly false claim that the man charged with killing more than a dozen people at a Florida high school belonged to an extremist group,\u201d Shawn Musgrave reported Friday for Politico.\n\n\u201cLaw enforcement agencies say they have no evidence so far to support this claim, and the rumor appears to have been perpetrated by white nationalist trolls themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOn Thursday afternoon, the Anti-Defamation League reported that a white supremacist group claimed ties with Nikolas Cruz, who confessed to the shooting spree that killed at least 17 people, including many high-school students, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.\n\n\u201c \u2018A spokesperson for the white supremacist group Republic of Florida (ROF) told the Anti-Defamation League on Thursday, February 15, that Nikolas Cruz [....] was associated with his group,\u2019 the ADL reported. The ADL quoted a man named Jordan Jereb, who runs the small group, which is based in Tallahassee.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018Jereb added that ROF had not ordered or wanted Cruz to do anything like the school shooting,\u2019 the ADL wrote in a blog post that was quickly picked up by ABC News and The Associated Press, and later percolated through dozens of other media outlets. Even The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, picked up the claim\n\n\u201cSome outlets reported they had their own conversations with Jereb or classmates of Cruz who allegedly corroborated the association of Cruz with ROF.\n\n\u201cBut a few hours later, after law enforcement agencies said they had no evidence linking Cruz to ROF, Jereb said his identification of Cruz was a \u2018misunderstanding\u2019 and that he, too, had been the subject of a \u2018prank.\u2019 On online forums and Twitter, trolls and white nationalists gloated at the disinformation they had sowed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018All of our evidence seems to point to the ADL getting this wrong,\u2019 said Joan Donovan, a researcher who tracks online misinformation campaigns for Data & Society, a think tank in New York City.\n\n\u201cThe ADL subsequently revised its report, as did many news outlets. . . .\u201d\n\nAssociated Press: White nationalist leader walks back comments that shooting suspect was group member\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJarvis DeBerry, NOLA.com | Times-Picayune: The numbing effect of multiple school shootings\n\nEditorial, Daily News, New York: Trump shoots blanks: He offers condolences but empty platitudes in the wake of South Florida\u2019s school massacre\n\nEditorial, Miami Herald: Yes, \u2018it\u2019 happened here.

We bring the hidden to light.\n\n\u201cJust like the \u2018Black Panther\u2019 movie and this novel does, they\u2019re bringing the character to light that some people knew about, and some people appreciated, but now through this novel and the movie, the entire world gets to know about it.\u2019\n\n\u201c \u2018. . .

The website projects it will earn $178 million over three days.\n\n\u201cThat would be enough to put it in the upper range of the top 10 highest grossing openings for a superhero movie. At that level, Black Panther would top heavyweights such as Batman, Superman and Spider-Man and take aim at the best-ever debut for a superhero movie focused on a solo character.\n\n\u201cStrong reviews, outstanding pre-sales and a holiday weekend release underpin the bullish forecast, but it might be the revolutionary nature of the film that pushes it beyond consensus estimates, said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at boxoffice.com. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGene Demby, NPR \u201cCode Switch\u201d: Can Marvel\u2019s New Superhero Bear The Weight Of Representation?\n\nJohn Eligon; Kwame Opam; Carvell Wallace; Crystal Martin; Walter Thompson-Hernandez; Mekado Murphy; Manohla Dargis and A.O.

Woodson came up with the idea of Negro History Week in 1926. He chose the week that included the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln, Feb. 12, and Frederick Douglass, Feb. 14.\n\n\u201cInitially, only North Carolina, Delaware, West Virginia, Baltimore, Md., and Washington, D.C., signed on to the idea \u2014 and only for their black schools, which is exactly what Woodson wanted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSegregation, by law or tradition, was prevalent in the 1920s. Woodson never envisioned white students learning black history. His concern was that black students, deprived of a thorough education about their ancestors, would grow up accepting the yoke of inferiority that white people insisted they wear. . . .\u201d\n\nJackson also wrote, \u201cNegro History Week was ours alone, but Black History Month became something else. Inspired by the black power movement, black students at Kent State University organized the first Black History Month in 1970. The idea caught on and in 1976 President Gerald Ford included Black History Month as part of the nation\u2019s bicentennial celebration.\n\n\u201cWith segregation gone, more schools reserved time each February to study the contributions of prominent African Americans in history \u2014 from Denmark Vesey to Thurgood Marshall to Barack Obama. But unfortunately, learning names, dates, and events was typically as far as their studies went. Too often the necessary attention to context and relevancy was missing from the lessons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat lack of historical context was evident in the results of a study released in January by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which showed only 8 percent of high school seniors knew slavery was the main cause of the Civil War. Two-thirds didn\u2019t know it took a constitutional amendment to end slavery. That\u2019s a sorry testament to how history is being taught in America\u2019s schools.\n\n\u201cInstead of going beyond Woodson\u2019s original idea to focus on the positive contributions of individual African Americans, too many schools use Black History Month as a vehicle to teach a catalog of events and people without making tangible connections to the status of black Americans today.\n\n\u201cOne result is white Americans who don\u2019t believe slavery has anything to do with today\u2019s United States. Neither their regular history classes nor any additional study they may have done during Black History Month helped them connect the dots among slavery, segregation, and the poverty found in too many black communities today. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid W.

It\u2019s not the answer we expected, but it accurately describes a high-tech spy adventure, set in an insular world where warring factions vie for leadership. But, last year on the Atlanta set of the highly anticipated superhero film, we learned there\u2019s much, much more going on.\n\nMore so than almost any Marvel movie before it, Black Panther has had an impossible task. Guardians of the Galaxy introduced a whole new section of the Marvel Cinematic Universe; Thor created an entirely new civilization, Black Panther has to do both of those things while making them them feel realistic enough to exist on Earth. The setting is Wakanda, a fictional African country whose abundance of the metal vibranium has made it incredibly rich and technologically advanced. It may look otherworldly, but it\u2019s part of our world, even though it remained hidden from the rest of it\u2014at least until T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman) revealed himself to the world as the Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War. But it\u2019s when the prince-turned-king returns home that Black Panther, directed by Creed\u2019s Ryan Coogler, begins.\n\nThe murder of King T\u2019Chaka and T\u2019Challa\u2019s sudden ascension to the throne have put Wakanda in turmoil, as summed up by what Moore called the questions at the heart of the film: \u201cWho rules Wakanda? How does Wakanda now deal with the loss of a king, who was a fair king, who people seemed to like? And is T\u2019Challa ready to be the king of Wakanda?\u201d\n\nBoseman explained that, at the start of the film, T\u2019Challa doesn\u2019t have time to think about being a superhero. \u201cHe\u2019s dealing with making the transition to filling the footsteps of his father,\u201d the actor said. \u201cSo it\u2019s probably going to feel like it\u2019s more about the political unrest than the superhero, initially.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat unrest will lead to a multi-faceted struggle between Wakanda and the CIA, in the form of Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman); fringe villains like Ulysses Klaw (Andy Serkis); power-hungry adversaries like Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan); and several other factions among the tribes that make up Wakanda. And that\u2019s not to mention T\u2019Challa\u2019s conflicting desires to help the world at large, but also keep his country both safe and secret.\n\nIn designing the look of not just the people of Wakanda, but the country itself, Coogler asked his longtime production designer Hannah Beachler for help. The two literally traveled the world from Africa to Korea and back, looking for inspirations, and came back with a movie that looks incredibly unique. \u201cHe always drags me into things I\u2019m not expecting I would ever do in my life,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cSo it\u2019s challenging and keeps me doing something new all the time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile on set last February, we were granted access to a conference room that had its walls lined with Beachler\u2019s work. It was overwhelming, especially several months before anyone outside of the production had seen the expansive, evocative aesthetic of the film. There were images of a huge spiral staircases made of metal and sand. Sweeping vistas of Wakandan landmarks\u2014like Mount Bashenga, the huge waterfalls of Warrior Falls, and the metal-meets-natural look of Golden City. \u201cOne of the things that we really wanted to be sure about Wakanda is the technology,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cI think that\u2019s something that all the fans want to see. \u2018What is this advanced civilization?\u2019 But the other thing that we really talked about was keeping the traditions of several different African tribes. So we really delved in to what that was, and how we mix this new and this old.\u201d\n\n(Here\u2019s a gallery of just some of that awesome art)\n\nShuri\u2019s Lab illustration by Drew Leung Steptown illustration by Till Nowak Palace Throne Room illustration by Till Nowak Palace Throne Room illustration by Till Nowak 1 / 4\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat new and old, a blending of African influences and advanced technology, is encapsulated in the designs of the Royal Talon and Talon Fighter. Each is an ultra-advanced ship, kind of like the Avengers\u2019 Quinjet, but only if you look at them from the sides. From the top, the ships are actually in the shape of an African mask. And though that sounds like a fairly radical idea, Beachler said her design was rooted in a future that\u2019s actually attainable. \u201cIt\u2019s not far off,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cIt\u2019s there in the conceptual ideas and designs that people are bringing, and we just are going to take it and show people, \u2018This is how it can be incorporated into a society.\u2019 So it\u2019s super-fun in that way.\u201d\n\nMore fun designs included images of a vibranium mine (which kind of looked like a scene from Tron, set underground, and which may be the setting for one of Black Panther\u2019s fight scenes), as well as T\u2019Challa riding a rhino, which is one of Wakanda\u2019s most precious animals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there was the Hall of Kings and City of the Dead, which evoke both the lush world of Pandora in Avatar and Westeros from Game of Thrones, where it appears the Wakandans pay tribute to past Black Panthers. \u201cIn the architecture and some of the dressing you\u2019ll get an idea of Panthers throughout the centuries,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see a little bit of it but I don\u2019t know that it\u2019ll be a big part of the film.\u201d\n\nDespite the executive producer\u2019s claim, the concept art we saw suggested otherwise; it looked like T\u2019Challa would perform some kind of astral projection that would allow the audience to see a bit of himself as a child, and Beachler hinted at this, too. \u201cYou see a lot of masks, all the panther masks, and you see how they do a lot of their rituals... and it will be fabulous and wonderful,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then also the dream states that he goes into when he meets the ancestors.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of Black Panther\u2019s other challenges is, if Wakanda is more advanced than anywhere else on Earth (and it is), it has to exceed any and everything we\u2019ve seen before in Earth-based Marvel movies. \u201c[Iron Man] was the one that set the pace for what you know as being futuristic [with Marvel],\u201d Beachler said. \u201cSo we did have to be mindful of how we\u2019re going to make it different. And we wanted Wakandans, and especially T\u2019Challa, to do the same things, but not have it be as recognizable as what Tony Stark is doing.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis technology is also where Black Panther finds its politics. \u201cJust the idea of Wakanda being a nation in Africa that is the most technologically advanced in the world is a political statement without us having to go too much far past that.\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think if people knew they had vibranium, which they do, they were going to be conquered or at least be at war forever. So they did the smart thing. They hid that fact so nobody knows they have this stuff. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve been able to have these advancements. They don\u2019t spend money on war. They don\u2019t spend money defending themselves constantly. They just spend money on infrastructure which is something, again, that will feel topical.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of the resources, advancement, and prosperity of Wakanda, a character like Shuri can exist. Played by Letitia Wright, Shuri is the smartest person in Wakanda and leader of their technological development. She\u2019s also T\u2019Challa\u2019s 16-year-old sister. \u201cIt\u2019s not very often that you see a superhero with a little sister,\u201d Boseman said. \u201cSo I think it brings out a different part of his character. Usually you have the damsel in distress [but] I don\u2019t think there are any damsels in distress in this movie.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an understatement. Coogler and his team have packed Black Panther with many, many strong black women. Paramount among them are the members of the Dora Milaje, the personal security for the King of Wakanda. However, while in the comics these warrior characters are at times sexualized, that\u2019s not the case in this film. Moore described them as more of a \u201cSEAL Team Six,\u201d each with their own unique characteristics and personalities. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t expect, and what [Coogler] really wanted to explore, is the depth of the emotional connections between T\u2019Challa and those individuals,\u201d he said. In other words, according to costume designer Ruth Carter, \u201cWe didn\u2019t want the guy in the skin suit walking around with the girls in the bathing suits.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the Dora Milaje, another classic Black Panther character in the film is Erik Killmonger, played by Coogler\u2019s longtime collaborator Michael B. Jordan. The actor said while the character is certainly a villain, he\u2019d more accurately described him as a \u201crevolutionary.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTrue villains, the really good ones and the interesting ones, the watchable ones, truly believe what they\u2019re doing is the right thing,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cAnd if you can somehow blur that line for the people\u2026 if you can kind of get them to see that other point of view, I think the battle\u2019s won.\u201d So it seems Killmonger\u2019s taste for power will have some form of selfless motivation to it, while Jordan will act them out in nearly unrecognizable fashion. His costume looks like a military Dragon Ball Z mash-up, complete with blue armor plates, beads holding it together, fatigue pants, gold teeth, and dreadlocks.\n\nKillmonger isn\u2019t the only other villain T\u2019Challa must deal with in Black Panther. There\u2019s also Ulysses Klaw, played by Andy Serkis, first seen in Avengers: Age of Ultron. His performance there sets the tone here. \u201cKlaw doesn\u2019t really trust or work with anybody; he is his own man,\u201d Serkis said. \u201cHe does deals with people, he interacts, but he doesn\u2019t form allegiances or alliances with anyone. Ultimately, he\u2019s a lone wolf. He has these pop-up groups wherever he happens to be in the world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose uncertain alliances seemed to be at the center of the scene Coogler and his team were filming when we were on set. The scene shot on February 3, 2017 featured Klaw, Killmonger, T\u2019Challa, Ross, Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), and Okoye (Danai Gurira), and took place at a CIA safehouse in South Korea where Klaw has been captured. T\u2019Challa and Okoye have just shown up and Ross is upset with them. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t see it before,\u201d he says. \u201cHow much more do you know?\u201d Just then, Nakia bursts in, speaking quickly in the African language Hausa. Suddenly a bomb goes off, the wall comes down, the window to the interrogation room cracks, and in storms KIllmonger and his crew, guns blazing. In the attack, T\u2019Challa somehow changes into his Black Panther suit and jumps on top of a grenade to save everyone, while bullets fly everywhere.\n\nThis scene was shot practically, including the two explosions. A major safety meeting was held on set beforehand and multiple rehearsals took place to make sure everyone was perfect on the timing. Boseman dynamically pushed himself up off the ground to really sell the grenade explosion. Multiple takes, increasing the coverage of the scene, were shot throughout the day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actors were unsurprisingly secretive about why Killmonger would be breaking Klaw out of this situation, as well as the rest of the film\u2019s plot. However, Moore said the film\u2019s main inspirations come from the current comic run of writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and the classic Black Panther stories of Christopher Priest, as well as some of the designs from those runs. There will be humor, but tonally Black Panther will be more Winter Soldier than Ant-Man. And though this is the last Marvel film which will be released before Avengers: Infinity War, it\u2019s not a set-up for that film.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to give Ryan the freedom to tell a story that wasn\u2019t relying on other things that were happening in the MCU,\u201d Moore said. \u201cNow that doesn\u2019t mean what happens in the film won\u2019t have ripples in the MCU, but the film itself isn\u2019t relying on other plot points in the MCU.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the end though, everyone involved really just wants fans to fall in love with the Black Panther and his country. \u201cImagine a whole world that is going to open up to audiences,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nBlack Panther opens February 16.\n\n*Correction: We had incorrectly labeled Hausa as an only south African language.

There were thriving and ideologically diverse cities surrounded by expansive and bucolic countrysides. There was modern technology perfectly weaved into cultural tradition, a melding that was symbiotic instead of antagonistic. And while I didn\u2019t see this happening during the movie, I\u2019m sure Wakanda has amazing bottomless brunches.\n\nUnfortunately, a present-day attempt to re-create Wakanda would be unrealistic. Mainly because we\u2019re roughly 20,000 years behind Wakandan tech. And mostly because we\u2019re too infected with colonization and its myriad residues and peripheral effects. Also, we\u2019re a little short on vibranium.\n\nOne thing, however, that we can and definitely should start doing is what M\u2019Baku and his Que Dog Jabari tribe did when encountering a problematic white dude who was speaking when there was no ask or need or purpose for the thoughts and opinions of problematic white dudes.\n\nBark.\n\nNot a purposeless bark. This isn\u2019t a shih tzu barking through the window at a squirrel. Instead, this would be an intentional bark. A targeted bark. An overpowering bark. A drowning bark. A Wakandan bark. A bark meant to communicate, \u201cUm, who told you that you can speak? When it is time for your words, we will let you know. And maybe that time will never come. We\u2019ll see. Now, just shut up and stand there. Maybe get on your phone and Google \u2018How not to be a colonizer.\u2019 Whatever you do, I want to hear you not speaking.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bark doesn\u2019t just have to be a counter for useless words, either. A wayward white hand reaches for your hair? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! A group of white people huddled on a sidewalk refuse to step aside when you attempt to walk past them? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! A purse is clutched when you walk on an elevator? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! (If they\u2019re going to act scared, you might as well give them a reason to be.)\n\nOf course, this barking will take some practice. They can\u2019t be small-dog barks, so people with higher and/or softer voices will probably have to do some training. Which is why, today, I\u2019m announcing the opening of the M\u2019Baku School of Wakandan White Silencing. The classes will be free, so no worries about me using GoFundMe monies for Bigen and creatine.\n\n\n\n(Sidenote: Also, the bark was actually an ape grunt.

They\u2019re so out of the box, in fact, that they\u2019ve completed a full revolution around the sun and they\u2019re back in the same fucking box. A box that someone needs to staple shut and drop-kick into a puddle.\n\nA few hundred words into the piece, they attempt to explain their rationale with an example of how it would work\u2014a hypothetical featuring recently laid-off West Virginians with dog-walking side hustles so thriving they need to hit up Craigslist ... but for undocumented immigrants for help. If there were a Pulitzer for \u201cWriting While Aggressively White,\u201d this passage would definitely be a nominee:\n\nImagine a woman named Mary Turner, who lives in Wheeling, West Virginia. She was recently laid off from a chicken-processing plant and makes ends meet by walking and taking care of her neighbors\u2019 pets. Mary could expand her little business by hiring some workers, but no one in the area would accept a wage she can afford. Mary goes online\u2014to a new kind of international gig economy website, a Fiverr for immigrants\u2014and applies to sponsor a migrant. She enters information about what she needs: someone with rudimentary English skills, no criminal record and an affection for animals. She offers a room in her basement, meals and $5 an hour. (Sponsors under this program would be exempt from paying minimum wage.) The website offers Mary some matches\u2014people living in foreign countries who would like to spend some time in the United States and earn some money. After some back and forth, Mary interviews a woman named Sofia who lives in Paraguay. Sofia, who grew up in a village, has endured hardships that few Americans can imagine. She is eager to earn some money so that she could move to her nation\u2019s capital city and get some vocational training. A few weeks later, Sofia arrives in Wheeling, after taking a one-week training course on American ways. If things don\u2019t work out, the agency that runs the website will find a new match for Sofia, and Mary will find someone new as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, I read the entire piece so you don\u2019t have to.

But actually seeing the commercial for what Hasbro is offering made me pause and feel something deeply emotional.\n\nIf you ask many comic book fans of color which characters they grew up loving, there\u2019s a good chance they\u2019ll name a white character like Spider-Man, Wolverine, or Batman. To be fair, these characters are great, but the fact of the matter is they\u2019re exponentially more widely marketed across a variety of media than other characters and so people come to know and identify with them more readily.\n\nA big part of how we come to love characters has to do with how much we\u2019re exposed to them and how often we\u2019re able to see ourselves in them in a meaningful way. Reading as the Black Panther and his genius sister Shuri save the world in the pages of comics is one thing, but seeing young black children actually embody those characters while having fun is something much more powerful. That\u2019s what makes Hasbro\u2019s line of Black Panther toys and the way the company\u2019s marketing them so incredibly fantastic.\n\n\n\nIn the first ad the company released, a black boy dons T\u2019Challa\u2019s Black Panther mask and claws, while a black girl along with a non-black friend wield Shuri\u2019s panther gauntlets as the trio are transported from their backyard directly to Wakanda. Obviously, the mask and claws are plastic with a bit of circuitry in them and the gauntlets are a new kind of Nerf gun but to be clear\u2014you almost never see toy ads aimed at and starring black children, and starring as the leads no less.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause characters of color have historically been relatively marginalized in movies, comics, and television, toys and commercials like this simply haven\u2019t existed before which is a shame in and of itself but has deeper consequences. Oftentimes, the first step towards becoming a fan of something or part of a larger fandom is finding a character that you can relate to when you\u2019re young and then seeing your relationship with them validated by the world around you.\n\n\n\nThat feedback loop of identification, and then affirmation, is what creates the ideas that \u201cI can be a hero too\u201d and \u201cthis fandom can be a place for me, as well.\u201d Toys and commercials like these, perhaps even more than the movies they\u2019re promoting, can have a way of creating lasting impressions and memories on kids for whom they\u2019re a gateway into a larger world of fantasy and scifi. Suddenly, they\u2014along with T\u2019Challa and co.\u2014are the ones defeating villains and protecting the planet. That kind of direct representation can have a profound impact on one\u2019s self-esteem in the long term.\n\nYes, these are just toys, but at the same time, they\u2019re so much more. They\u2019re an invitation\u2014an affirmation\u2014and something I wish I\u2019d had when I was growing up.", "keywords": ["world", "black", "seeing", "panther", "way", "starring", "important", "characters", "young", "understand", "toys", "theyre", "commercial", "toy"], "polarity": 0.17847673160173153, "subjectivity": 0.4506551484230054},

So, of course, when New York Fashion Week and Black Panther premiere week collided Monday night, there was a presentation inspired by Oscar winner Ruth E. Carter\u2019s costumes from the film.\n\n\n\nThe \u201cWelcome to Wakanda\u201d fashion presentation had guests lined up around West 12th Street in New York City dressed in their most regal Ankara couture to get inside Industria Studios, the fashion-centric studio space and event venue where designs from Chromat, Cushnie et Ochs, Fear of God, Ikir\u00e9 Jones, LaQuan Smith, Sophie Theallet and Tome were on display.\n\nThe immersion into Wakanda began with the walls, covered in leaves that branched out like ivy. At the entrance into the concrete jungle sat the blue Lexus LC 500 used during the film, with slashes from the Black Panther across its hood. Inside the purple-lit studio, seven stunning models posed in bespoke couture designs while standing on a moss-covered stage. Golden thrones were positioned on the stage like arrows on a compass, giving guests the hottest backdrop to flex on the \u2019gram.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Industria really transformed into Wakanda when the stars of Black Panther\u2014Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Danai Gurira and Winston Duke\u2014held court on the black carpet. Mingling with guests and posing with the models inspired by their characters, the stars lit up the venue, taking laps around the stage and selfies with guests who dined on Wakanda Patties, made of chickpea and roast yam, and Cricket Tarts, made of chocolate-roasted crickets. Guests sipped signature drinks as artist and DJ Heron Preston kept the crowd\u2014and singer Elle Varner\u2014dancing till long past last call. Clearly, it\u2019s lit in Wakanda.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the bar closed, even after the lights came up and janitors began sweeping up the floor, the crowds still didn\u2019t disperse, wanting to stay in the safe haven of black excellence just a little while longer. But with gift bags from event sponsor Redken in hand, the guests eventually shuffled off into the night, counting down the days till they can get back to the affirming space carved into existence by Black Panther.\n\n\n\nFortunately, the joy of the evening will continue on, as the seven bespoke pieces will be auctioned off by CharityBuzz to benefit the international humanitarian organization Save the Children. And the film-inspired capsule collections that were on display by shoe-and-accessories designer Brother Vellies, Black Panther jewelry and armor designer and official jeweler Douriean, and knitwear designer Josh Bennett are on sale today, Tuesday, for all the fans who want to keep the magic alive. #WakandaForever, indeed!", "keywords": ["guests", "wakanda", "black", "week", "till", "york", "stage", "panther", "welcome", "designer", "bnyfw", "venue"], "polarity": 0.10379182449494952, "subjectivity": 0.4061868686868687},

A whiteness manicotti. A whiteness Thai fried rice.\n\nAnyway, there are too many levels of whiteness in this story to list at one time, so I\u2019ll just name 10.\n\n1.

The fact that she has a gotdamn lawyer. Which means a lawsuit is a possibility.\n\n7. The fact that her gotdamn lawyer was quoted as saying, \u201cThis was a highly stressful situation, and people react in a lot of different ways. She\u2019s only 21 years old, a kid still,\u201d despite the fact that she\u2019s 21 FUCKING YEARS OLD, WHICH MEANS SHE IS NOT A KID STILL.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. The fact that she apparently already has a new hamster, one that I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll also murder when told she\u2019s not allowed to co-sign a loan for it.\n\n9. The fact that SOMEONE SOLD ANOTHER HAMSTER TO AN INFAMOUS HAMSTER MURDERER. Niggas go to prison for 50 years for stealing Snickers Ice Cream Bars, and this known hamster murderer gets help.\n\n10.

Originally based on supermodels Naomi Campbell and Tyra Banks, the Dora were initially conceived not only as female warriors but also as potential wives for the king, whom they\u2019ve pledged to protect, along with the royal family. They were the best and strongest women from the 18 villages within Wakanda and trained at the royal palace.\n\nBut while Priest may in part cite supermodels as his inspiration, there is a historical prototype for the Dora Milaje in the Dahomey \u201cAmazons\u201d\u2014so nicknamed by European colonizers and now known by the French-speaking Beninese as the \u201cN\u2019Nonmiton\u201d (which translates to \u201cour mothers\u201d in Fon).\n\nCreated in the late 17th century by King Wegbaja of the West African nation of Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) as a group of female hunters known as gbeto, and later expanded by his son King Agaja, the N\u2019Nonmiton were an all-female guard and fighting force. Like the Dora Milaje, the N\u2019Nonmiton were also considered wives of the king, pledging celibacy as well as loyalty and protection to him. And they existed in this role until the colonization of Dahomey in the late 19th century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can learn all about the incredible female warriors of Dahomey in a 2015 episode of the podcast Stuff You Missed in History Class, and in a very comprehensive comic on their history created by UNESCO for its Series on Women in African History (pdf).

You can hate them because they\u2019re really fucking good and they\u2019ve been really fucking good for 15 years despite never really being dominant. I\u2019ve never seen a team that, along with being great, also frequently got so damn lucky, and you can hate them for that. You can hate them because Tom Brady is Scientologist-adjacent.

Wes Walker. Rob Gronkowski. Danny Woodhead. Chris Hogan. Julian Edelman. Danny Amendola. Rex Burkhead. THESE ARE NOT THE NAMES OF REAL PEOPLE! THESE ARE THE NAMES OF PEOPLE CREATED BY A WHITE-SKILL-POSITION GENERATOR. Besides New England, there are, like, three white running backs and receivers in the NFL total.

While waiting to prepurchase tickets for Black Panther, I developed an unhealthy obsession with Fandango, and my wallet wept when the Funko POP! figures were released. I was excited to go to Wakanda, y\u2019all, and Wakanda did not disappoint.\n\nExcept for one aspect.\n\n\n\nMaybe.\n\n\n\nSee, something was revealed about the movie before its release: a missed opportunity for queer representation. Back in April, news spread of a rough cut in which Okoye (Danai Gurira) and Ayo (Florence Kasumba) did a bit of flirting. Vanity Fair\u2019s Joanna Robinson had this to say:\n\n\n\nIn the rough cut of this Black Panther scene, we see Gurira\u2019s Okoye and Kasumba\u2019s Ayo swaying rhythmically back in formation with the rest of their team. Okoye eyes Ayo flirtatiously for a long time as the camera pans in on them. Eventually, she says, appreciatively and appraisingly, \u2018You look good.\u2019 Ayo responds in kind. Okoye grins and replies, \u2018I know.\u2019\n\nShortly after the story broke, Marvel reached out to say that no, their relationship was not a romantic one (as stated in the update to Robinson\u2019s article). Oh, and it turns out, the scene was cut from the film, hence the \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d commentary on every single article that pops up if you Google the words \u201cBlack Panther queer\u201d right now. Co-screenwriter Joe Robert Cole said this in an interview with Screen Crush:\n\n\n\nI think the short answer is yes. I know that there were quite a few conversations around different things, different directions with different characters, and characters that we may have. We thought, \u2018Well, maybe we\u2019ll work it this way with an arc or work it that way with an arc.\u2019 The scene you\u2019re talking about, I don\u2019t remember. I can\u2019t remember the exact exchange you\u2019re talking about, but I think it was really brief. I\u2019m not sure. I know that it was not \u2013 there wasn\u2019t some major theme through that we were looking to explore with that in terms of the story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI sat there, waiting to feel betrayed, like Santa didn\u2019t deliver the puppy I wanted, no matter how good I\u2019d been. It\u2019s an all-too-familiar feeling as a black, queer woman: the Hollywood game of \u201cQueerness? What\u2019s that?\u201d Some exceptions may apply, like if it\u2019s a niche movie that won\u2019t have an entire toy section dedicated to it or that one side character whose name you don\u2019t remember. And, of course, there\u2019s Netflix or television (and I\u2019ve praised Black Lightning character Anissa Pierce to the heaven\u2019s above). But when it comes to those multimillion-dollar box-office hits? Yeah, no.\n\nSeeing Black Panther, I was fully prepared to be salty. But the salt never hit me. I went out, saw the movie, got home and ... no salt. Just pure black joy.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo then I thought, \u201cWow, Bri, what kind of queer woman are you?\u201d I should\u2019ve been cursing Ryan Coogler out, swift and fast like my mama taught me when someone pisses me off. But after thinking it over, I\u2019m happy the scene didn\u2019t make it into the movie, and that feels blasphemous to admit as someone who is always championing representation\u2014especially for queer folks of color like me.\n\nBefore I explain why, let me preface it by saying two things: 1) I don\u2019t expect every queer person of color to feel this way, and neither should anyone reading this. We\u2019re not some monolith that is always gonna see eye to eye, so don\u2019t be out here using my words to discredit someone\u2019s valid feelings. 2) People who have expressed disappointment with the scene\u2019s removal have still found joy in the movie. It doesn\u2019t make them hypocrites; it just means that they\u2019re capable of criticizing something they love. And that\u2019s how improvement happens.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m gonna level with you, as someone who\u2019s been squinting through heteronormative romance to try and find a whisper of queerness: Okoye and Ayo flirting with each other ain\u2019t enough for me anymore. It\u2019s the bare minimum of queer representation\u2014the table scraps\u2014especially if it\u2019s two women, and especially if those two women are attractive.\n\nLet\u2019s be real: T\u2019Challa and Nakia are getting whole-ass scenes that go beyond, \u201cI looked at you, then you looked at me.\u201d That\u2019s what I want more of in my queer representation, especially considering the source material that people were referencing when discussing Okoye and Ayo: World of Wakanda.\n\nWritten by Roxane Gay and Yona Harvey, this story is about Ayo and another Dora Milaje named Aneka (who doesn\u2019t appear in the movie, but people suspected Okoye had taken her place as a love interest). In the book, Ayo and Aneka are the focal points, and they\u2019re allowed to develop as both characters and lovers with each turn of the page.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can understand the excitement of potentially including this aspect in the movie, but that breeze of commentary between Okoye and Ayo? That ain\u2019t it. A moment like that can get easily swept away as, \u201cYou\u2019re reading too much into this,\u201d or even, \u201cThat\u2019s just how women are.\u201d\n\nAfter all, if Katy Perry taught us anything, it\u2019s that she kissed a girl\u2014and she liked it\u2014but don\u2019t read too much into it. To do this plot justice, there\u2019d need to be multiple interactions between those women, ones that didn\u2019t solely revolve around flirtation.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nI didn\u2019t think that was gonna happen with Black Panther. I would\u2019ve loved to see it, especially with all the time and care put into portraying Africa and black culture. But you know what else came with that clear love letter to Africa? Boycotts and plans to give negative reviews, because we\u2019re clearly trying to take over white superhero-dom.\n\nNow imagine, for a moment, the reaction if we also had queerness within this blackity-black movie. Actually, you don\u2019t have to imagine it; you can read the comments on any article that dares to complain about the scene\u2019s removal. Nothing says encouragement to implement some intersectionality like being told to let folks enjoy the damn movie without making things so \u201cpolitical\u201d\u2014even if there\u2019s already a comic featuring queer Dora Milaje.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo maybe Coogler and his crew are pacing themselves. Actress Florence Kasumba (who plays Ayo) recently spoke to Jamie Broadnax and Abraham Riesman in an Interview for Vulture about it. For the record, Kasumba is here for queer Ayo, but also had this to add:\n\n\n\nThe thing is, if the makers would have wanted everyone to see the scene, it would have been in the movie. The final result that we\u2019ve seen, there were a few scenes that have been cut. Different scenes, also. They didn\u2019t make it into the movie for certain reasons, and at that point, I have to say: What their reason is, I can\u2019t tell you, because nobody told me about whether it\u2019s in or not. But at this point, I personally think people have no idea who T\u2019Challa is, who are the Wakandans, what is Wakanda, where is Wakanda, what is their culture. There are so many important things that had to be told in these two hours. So the focus was on what is so important for T\u2019Challa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI realize that all of this is a frustrating pill to swallow. And real talk: If there\u2019s any group that\u2019s used to being told, \u201cYour representation might be there later,\u201d it\u2019s queer POC. Black Panther made his first appearance back in 1966, and it took 50 years for there to be a comic based primarily on two queer characters ... and it quickly got canceled. So yeah, those disappointed reactions? Completely justified. I might want better representation before I settle on any ol\u2019 thing, but I also know that when you\u2019re starving, table scraps are savored like a full-course meal.\n\nBut if there\u2019s something I want you to take away from this, it\u2019s that we\u2019re actually discussing queer women of color making a big-screen appearance, and we\u2019re being taken seriously. This scene has started something, and if Coogler puts as much effort into artfully portraying queerness as he did blackness, the future movies in the series will be the most intersectional thing in any movie-verse, not just Marvel\u2019s.\n\nI never thought my cynical, eye-rolling, \u201cOf course the queer scene got cut\u201d self would be saying this, but I think the forces behind this movie are capable of giving queer characters the respect they deserve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019re not there yet, but I think we can be in the future.", "keywords": ["black", "play", "emotions", "ayo", "queer", "scene", "movie", "panther", "think", "dont", "women", "representation", "okoye"], "polarity": 0.11899707996406107, "subjectivity": 0.4967954477388439},

(I\u2019m speaking at the University of Alabama this evening), I stopped at a newsstand to get some orange juice and to consider buying one of those neck-pillow things for the flight. (I declined. These things are $17.99 in Pittsburgh, but here it was 37 whole American dollars. Fuck that. I ended up just making a pillow out of an unopened pack of boxer briefs I brought with me. Yup, I\u2019m a grown-ass man, and I just slept on some drawers.)\n\nWhile I was in line, a 20-something white woman in front of me kept glancing back and smirking. I thought perhaps she was a real-life Rose Armitage, so I turned my phone flash on just in case she tried any funny business.

I\u2019ve never heard it. Have a good day.\u201d\n\nAs I walked out of the store, I could hear her still singing the chorus of \u201cLocation\u201d softly to herself. And I was just glad I turned my flash on.\n\nIn the last two weeks, I\u2019ve been in Miami, Baltimore, D.C. (twice) and now Birmingham. Along with the airports in those cities, I\u2019ve had layovers in Charlotte, N.C., and Atlanta. And in that 14-day span, I\u2019ve had five separate nonblack people (three white women, a white man and an Asian man) mention that I look like Khalid\u2014an artist I had to Google a few months ago after another white woman in Pittsburgh said I looked like him. Yet when I\u2019ve shared this information with black people\u2014that white people keep telling me I look like him\u2014their responses range from \u201cWTF?\u201d to \u201cOf course. Because we all look alike to them.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy wife thinks (most) white people are just unable or unwilling to find any distinctions with black people\u2019s faces. That they just see the similarities with our hair, our beards and our complexions, but what we actually look like just doesn\u2019t register. This would explain the other person white people frequently tell me I remind them of: Donald Glover. Which is even more perplexing for what I assume are very, very, very, very, very obvious reasons. (Also, it\u2019s interesting that both Khalid and Donald Glover are considerably smaller men than I am, which makes me wonder if white people just automatically assign an exaggerated physical size to black men. Which, again, makes me glad my phone has a flash function.)\n\nAnyway, most of the black people I\u2019ve shared this story with also have stories about white people stopping them to tell them they look like people. Apparently this is the world\u2019s most annoying silent epidemic. But after an informal poll I conducted on Google Hangouts just now, none of these black people are walking up to random white people to tell them they look exactly like Steve Nash.\n\nSo basically, the moral of the story is that if you\u2019re a white person and you think some random black person looks like some other random black person, keep those thoughts to yourself. Because you\u2019re probably wrong. They\u2019ll probably be annoyed.

However, the past few years have finally seen some cracks in the proverbial glass ceiling as black culture has permeated into the mainstream of the comic book universe. From Marvel\u2019s reimagining of classic rap album covers as comic book covers to the success of Black Lightning, Luke Cage and what is expected to be a massive bow at the box office for Black Panther, minorities in comic books are no longer a rarity in 2018.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s astounding to consider that it took this long for comic book publishers to recognize the appeal of black characters who are more than just sidekicks and henchmen. But with the buzz for Black Panther and seeing just how much a black character resonated with an audience, the door has been thrust wide open for more black characters who look, talk and act like us to be featured in this medium.\n\n\u201cRepresentation matters. The lack of representation also matters,\u201d comic book writer Bryan Edward Hill explains to The Root. \u201cStories ultimately tie back to mythology, and it\u2019s the way we rationalize good and evil. When you\u2019re not represented in stories, especially when you\u2019re not a protagonist or a hero, and you\u2019re confronted with that over and over again, subconsciously you start to question your own agency in the world.\u201d\n\nThe significance of black children and adults seeing themselves in comic books has long been undervalued by publishers. But with a diverse crop of black heroes (and anti-heroes) cropping up and finding success, films like Black Panther will hopefully become the norm and no longer outliers that we have to celebrate because we\u2019re unsure we\u2019ll ever see something like them again.\n\nHill\u2019s ongoing DC Comics series, Michael Cray, is one that will draw its fair share of attention because of the comic\u2019s unique narrative and the fact that it is written by a black man with a black title character and a black artist providing the visual element.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Cray is a fascinating story in which the title character is an assassin who exists in an alternate version of the DC universe and is tasked with hunting down evil versions of DC heroes, which include Arrow, the Flash and Aquaman.\n\n\u201cThe initial concept was pretty broad,\u201d Hill says of the spinoff to DC\u2019s The Wildstorm, by Warren Ellis. \u201c[Ellis] wanted me to tell a story of this guy who is in between masters and found a new organization that wanted him to take out evil versions of DC heroes. I was interested in the idea of not being able to trust your own consciousness and Cray\u2019s background as a guy who has received dogma his entire life. There\u2019s a story of a guy growing in power while simultaneously being a weapon for other people, and how those things come into conflict [is] really interesting.\u201d\n\nHill drew upon his own personal experiences as well as conversations with family and friends who had a military background to mold the personality of Cray.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI try to find real-world experience that I can insert into the work,\u201d he says. \u201cI was able to reach out to some people and get some stories about what it was like to hunt human beings for a living. From that research, I was able to paint a portrait that felt authentic to me. Then I layered it with my own life experience.\u201d\n\nAs for Hill\u2019s journey to this point, it\u2019s certainly been one that is unique in its own right.\n\nWith his father\u2019s untimely death due to cancer when he was 8, Hill desperately needed something to have faith in. After entering a comic book store and coming across a Batman comic that seemed to mirror his emotional weight of losing a parent, the St. Louis native found something to believe in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBruce Wayne was going through everything I was going through, but he was able to take that pain and turn it into something,\u201d Hill recalls. \u201cAs a kid, you are looking for your pathways and trying to figure out what is possible and what is impossible. For me, Batman became an instructive mythology on how to deal with grief, anger and all of those emotions.\u201d\n\nWith St. Louis admittedly not being a fertile ground for breeding African-American writers, Hill grew up enjoying comics but never really considered a career writing comics until later in life.\n\n\u201cI wanted to go into law enforcement,\u201d Hill reveals. \u201cI thought I was going to be an FBI agent, but my mother said, \u2018Nope, you can\u2019t have a gun so pick something else.\u2019 If I couldn\u2019t be an FBI agent, I wanted to tell stories. That led me to writing, and comics were always the most exciting stories you can read. I couldn\u2019t get that experience from any other forum.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter graduating from New York University film school, Hill worked as a freelance journalist before landing his first comic-writing job with Top Cow Productions in 2010. Since then, he\u2019s worked on a number of comics, including Witchblade, Postal and 7 Days From Hell.\n\nHe recognized early on that he was a black writer in a predominantly white space and needed to find a way to balance servicing the needs of readers with introducing characters of color.\n\n\u201cWhen I started writing, I knew that if you were to platform and agenda the task of writing characters of color and center them in fiction, you would have a very difficult path to be a professional,\u201d he says. \u201cEarly on, I would always balance things. There were less opportunities for writers of color and characters of color to be in these stories. This evolution that we\u2019ve had is a great thing. We\u2019re no longer telling a new generation what they can\u2019t do; they are growing up with a more wide-open field of participation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing at the helm of Michael Cray has been yet another balancing act for the 40-year-old. With a history of black characters being trapped in their own blackness, Hill sought to ensure that Cray was a black man with black experiences, but one who was not defined solely by those encounters.\n\n\u201cI know that as a black man, I don\u2019t wake up every day thinking about being black and filter every experience I have through a prism of race,\u201d Hill says. \u201cBut there tends to be a trend when you have characters of color that is the only thing they think about the entire time, and every conversation is governed by it. It\u2019s just not realistic. A lot of it is well-intentioned and broadens the conversation, but a lot of it left me cold because it doesn\u2019t feel real to me.\u201d\n\nRather than force Michael Cray\u2019s blackness into every conversation he has in the comic, Hill made it a point that while his character is black, it isn\u2019t all that the story is about. After all, Michael Cray is about a man who is hunting down a twisted version of the Flash. The psychology behind that alone is worth dissecting, and Hill manages to do that while making sure the reader is never misled into thinking that Michael Cray is anything but a black man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have more dimensions than [just being black],\u201d Hill says while looking toward the future in a post-Black Panther world. \u201cThat is the next evolution of characters of color. Allowing them to escape the gravitational pull of the story being about their race. We have other stories to tell. Being black is an element of the story, but we don\u2019t want to make his story only about that.\u201d", "keywords": ["writer", "black", "michael", "hill", "explains", "color", "writing", "characters", "edward", "comic", "flash", "cray", "comics", "kill", "book", "representation", "matter"], "polarity": 0.05555084426353084, "subjectivity": 0.5093901434386509},

Hyacinthe is one of the hardest-hustling creatives in New York City, crafting a hybrid career out of her two greatest passions: music and fashion. By day, the stylist and CEO of Immaculate Wardrobe dresses Fortune 500 female power brokers; by night, she\u2019s DJ Soda Pop, spinning hip-hop and house at Manhattan venues like the Museum of Sex\u2014where she launches a weekly residency tonight.\n\nThe Glow Up recently caught up with the busy Bronx-born beauty to discuss her parallel creative careers and her future as a fashion DJ. The product of what she describes as a traditional Haitian-American family, Hyacinthe grew up on a steady diet of hip-hop and haute couture, influenced by three older brothers and a style-obsessed stepsister. Her own obsession with fashion began so early, she recalls cutting out and stashing Vogue spreads under her pillowcase, just so she could wear the outfits in her dreams:\n\nI remember being in school\u2014we had to list our skills, what we were good at. And the only thing I [could] think of was that I can put clothes together nicely. ... And I remember picking up\u2014it was Vibe magazine\u2014and they used to have the fashion editorials, and I saw [celebrity fashion stylist] June Ambrose. And they had this article, and I remember it led with \u201cstyle architect,\u201d and I was just like, \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to do!\u201d She was a major inspiration. ... I just saw her, and I was like, \u201cThis is what I aspire to be.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, it was a mentoring program led by image activist Michaela angela Davis that would be the conduit for bringing Hyacinthe\u2019s aspirations to fruition\u2014and would teach her a powerful lesson in asking for what you want:\n\nIt all starts with Michaela; she was running something called Salon du Shine at her house, where there\u2019d be a group of, like, 10 of us girls [getting] together in her loft in Brooklyn. And we would just talk about stuff, you know. And I remember going up to Michaela, like, \u201cCan you introduce me to June Ambrose?\u201d And she was just like, \u201cI don\u2019t know ... June is super-busy.\u201d I kid you not: A couple of days later, Michaela calls me and she says, \u201cJune is looking for an intern.\u201d... So I went to the interview\u2014June\u2019s two assistants at the time, they tore me to pieces\u2014but I wound up getting the internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile interning for Ambrose, Hyacinthe also worked full time to put herself through the Fashion Merchandising Management program at New York City\u2019s Berkeley College. It was the beginning of a career path that her Haitian parents, unfortunately, didn\u2019t understand:\n\nMy parents\u2014although they were very loving\u2014they didn\u2019t understand the concept of me wanting to be a stylist and me being in a creative field; it was foreign to them. ... They didn\u2019t have the opportunity to dream as we do, and I think because of that, they\u2019re unable to\u2014they\u2019re in a sense blind to that. ... So I wound up having to put myself through college; I worked full time [in retail] and I did this internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorking for Ambrose taught Hyacinthe how the editorials she once obsessed over were created, but it was working in retail that helped her find her niche: helping busy professional women build their wardrobes.\n\nI would work with clients, and they\u2019d be like, \u201cSophia, I love working with you; you style me so well. I wish you could come dress me at home.\u201d And one day I actually got the courage to say, \u201cWell, I can.\u201d ... So this one client took me up on it, and I went to her house and started with her closet. But then she had me speak with her career coach, and that\u2019s when it really clicked: This is on another level. Like, you know, female executives really need this. And I really found the value that I could add.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIdentifying her core clientele and their unique need to possess a high-end wardrobe without having the time to curate or shop for it, Hyacinthe launched her company, Immaculate Wardrobe. The self-described \u201cwardrobe whisperer\u201d currently dresses about 20 clients, all of whom are powerful women who inspire her daily, as she explained:\n\n\n\nI work primarily with female boss bitches. These are women that are working [as] CEOs of companies, and they\u2019re also moms. ... I feel like it\u2019s really important for me to surround myself with these powerful women. And I feel like since they\u2019re at the top of their companies, not only am I empowering them, but also the women that come [into their companies] that\u2019ve just graduated from college ... to see that someone at the top of their career is not only killing it, but also killing it with style.\n\nBut while helping other women fulfill their potential, Hyacinthe also realized an opportunity to further fulfill her own. A longtime avid lover of music, she was often critical of DJs on the New York City nightclub scene. Challenged by an exasperated friend to learn for herself, she accepted his gift of a DJ class at New York\u2019s famed Rock & Soul record store. Instantly, another passion was born, along with an alter ego: DJ Soda Pop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike her styling career, Hyacinthe\u2019s growth as a DJ has been simultaneously organic and self-driven. She initially asked more-established DJs for opening slots and cultivated her own contacts and connections. It\u2019s a path that called into conflict the hip-hop-loving girl from New York\u2019s Bronx borough and the cultured style expert whom elite businesswomen entrust with their wardrobes:\n\n\n\nGrowing up in my family, I grew up listening to Reasonable Doubt, to Onyx, to Nas\u2014like, really hard music. Like, I\u2019m very feminine and girly now, but I grew up liking really hard-core rap. I\u2019ve always known that I\u2019ve had this love and passion for music, but it was, \u201cOK, Sophia, either you can pursue fashion styling or you can be a DJ.\u201d I didn\u2019t think in my mind\u2014I couldn\u2019t fathom the idea of me flourishing in both fields ... [But] to be honest with you, I can\u2019t exist with one without the other. ... I feel like they feed into each other so much, especially the route that I want to go. ... I want to be New York\u2019s new fashion DJ, and there\u2019s not enough of us brown girls up there that are actually doing it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile her dual careers may seem to be a study in contrasts, Hyacinthe approaches both spinning and styling instinctively, using unexpected textural combinations to evoke new feelings. And in the process of embracing her dual passions, her own identity fell into place.\n\nI feel like deejaying has really helped me fully come into my skin. ... Even with race: It\u2019s like before, I thought that I needed to kind of neglect my own identity to be accepted. And I know I\u2019m not the only one that feels that way; as a black woman in the fashion industry, which is predominantly white. I thought that I needed to strip some of my identity\u2014the fact that I listened to hip-hop, the fact that I loved it, the fact that I came from the Bronx\u2014I thought that I almost needed to move away from that in order for me to be seen in society as being this elegant person in fashion ... [but] I feel like once you accept yourself, they have no choice but to accept you for who you are. And I feel like deejaying has really allowed me to accept myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re in the New York City area, you can catch DJ Soda Pop every Thursday night at the Museum of Sex at 233 Fifth Ave. She launches her weekly residency Thursday night with a viewing party for RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race.", "keywords": ["fashion", "dressed", "double", "night", "really", "feel", "york", "inside", "career", "think", "hyacinthe", "sophia", "dj", "wardrobe", "women", "life", "dope"], "polarity": 0.16347579051383396, "subjectivity": 0.5693305335968378},

It\u2019s a movie based on a story by Susan McMartin and the time she spent with her own real-life Mr. Church. It looked like a film where Eddie was playing a pantheon-level Magical Negro. I didn\u2019t see it back then and honestly forgot about its existence until Wednesday when I was perusing the Amazon Prime racks for something to watch.\n\nI saw Eddie Murphy\u2019s face on a movie and was like, \u201cHmm, I didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d released a movie so recently.\u201d I hit play and holy shit, bro, this is one of those movies where prospective Magical Negroes sit around and watch, take notes and then commiserate about how to up their Magical Negro-ness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike, right now, I could go outside, find me a white person, do the shit I saw in this movie, and I\u2019d bet a book would be written about how much of a better person I made them within six months. The lessons in Mr. Church have too much sauce. All shade aside, I actually enjoyed the movie; we all could use our own Mr. Church. Pretend that didn\u2019t sound slave-y.\n\nNot for nothing, but I\u2019d be really curious about the real Mr. Church\u2019s view of the movie and the story told of his life, though he passed on many years ago. Not that it\u2019s a bad one; it\u2019s just interesting. What makes Mr. Church a pantheon-level Magical Negro? A Magical Negro\u2019s Magical Negro? I\u2019m glad you asked. Here are 10 reasons:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. The entire premise of this movie is textbook Magical Negro-dom. A random black man shows up in the home of a white woman dying from breast cancer and her daughter to serve as their cook until the mother dies, projected to be in six months. I think the original title of the film was White Mom, Black Cook, but horny focus-group participants kept punching that into the search box on XVideos and it just got freaky.\n\nBack to the lecture at hand: Where does he come from? I haven\u2019t the foggiest. Some other person set the shit up. All we know is that he\u2019s there and the foods are going to get cooked come hell or high water. Also, he\u2019s been entreated with the responsibility of paying all of the bills from some mythical account for everything. Listen, while I\u2019d be leery if some random black man showed up to my house hovering over my not-quite-KitchenAid pots and pans, the minute he said, \u201cI got this, boo-boo\u201d as I looked at my Pepco bill, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d call him \u201cZaddy.\u201d\n\n2. When the mother lives an additional SIX YEARS, apparently, Mr. Magical Negro pays for all the bills out of his own pockets once that six-month fund runs low. How so? Well, in the FIRST place, he was offered a lifetime salary in exchange for cooking for six months, till the mother died. So, all that money he DID make when she lived? He poured right back into that household. Why for come? Because that\u2019s what a Magical Negro does; he fills a need where he sees one. Like reading to the mother nightly while she lay in bed searching for energy. Reading. Over and over. That\u2019s magic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. UPPING that ante, he goes to the supermarket one day and learns how much he saves by using coupons. Well, turns out he saves all of the savings over the course of the next, like, six or seven years, and when Charlie, the daughter, is all ready to go to college and gets into Boston University but can\u2019t afford it, there\u2019s Mr. Church right there with an envelope of all his coupon savings to cover her tuition. He gave her, like, $5,000. Do you know how much Hennessy he could have bought with $5,000? In 1977? But nope, he\u2019s here handing out magical envelopes. Of cash. To white teenagers. And cars.\n\n4. Here\u2019s part of his \u00fcber-magical nature: Charlie, the daughter who grows up and is who Mr. Church largely takes care of in life, hates reading books as a child. Especially books brought into her motherfucking establishment by some random black man who cooks delectable eats. Or, at least, she does at first. Over time, he introduces her to all the classics through his library system of having her check out books he brings over. She went from reading street signs to all of the classics. He gave her culture and depth. I salute you, Mr. Church.\n\n5. He always calls Charlie \u201cmy dear.\u201d It\u2019s reminiscent of The Princess Bride\u2019s Dread Pirate Roberts, aka Westley, and his constant refrain of \u201cas you wish\u201d to Princess Buttercup. Such a good movie. The Princess Bride, that is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. In true Magical Negro fashion, we never really learn much about Mr. Church\u2019s background until he dies. Turns out he was not only a great cook but also played the piano at a spot called Jelly\u2019s every weekend. In my mind, all Magical Negroes meet up at Jelly\u2019s on Sundays for brunch. His father was a horrible man and a mean cuss. But Mr. Church has always loved Charlie and her mother for giving him something he didn\u2019t have: a family. Which is Magical Negro parlance for, \u201cI\u2019ve never had one before.\u201d \u201cA room to yourself?\u201d \u201cA bed.\u201d [Half-smile.] Scene.\n\n7. Piggybacking on No. 6, Mr. Church has one rule: \u201cRespect his privacy.\u201d What does the white girl do? Charlie goes white girl and does not respect his privacy and digs and snoops through his shit and gets caught. And because Magical Negroes DO make mistakes on occasion\u2014he also often gets drunk when he\u2019s at Jelly\u2019s\u2014he puts her ass RIGHT out for snooping. But she\u2019s ALSO like hella pregnant and has nowhere to go, except to some store where some kid on a skateboard runs into her and her old friend from the neighborhood, Larson, happens to see her and gets her to the hospital, where Mr. Church magically shows up to claim her and bring her home.\n\n8. In what can only be described as a Magical Negro by Osmosis, it turns out that Larson was about to commit suicide with liquor and pills when Charlie got hit by the boy on a skateboard, and he had to help save her life, which, in turn, helped save his life. Mr. Church is out here saving white people by association.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Charlie has her baby and then one of her former friends comes back into the picture and is now rich and snobby and Charlie wants to drop her as a friend. Mr. Church tells her not to get caught up in that shit. He\u2019s saving white relationships.\n\n10. Mr. Church ends up getting sick and dying and shit. Before he does that, though, he ends up teaching Charlie how to cook, play piano, garden, live, breathe, not die and ultimately be a good human. And he gave her the most important Magical Negro gift of all: She was able to write a story about him and became an author, thereby creating a job and livelihood by virtue of his very existence in her life.\n\nTo Mr. Church, a Magical Negro like no other.", "keywords": ["shit", "negro", "charlie", "movie", "mr", "reasons", "white", "does", "magical", "church", "negrod", "magically", "mother"], "polarity": 0.1633413283413283, "subjectivity": 0.5720266695266695},

Like loads of other filmgoers around the country, many of them arrived early and dressed in African-inspired garb to watch the movie.\n\nThe Sun notes what 22-year-old college student Tabitha Morgan wrote in an email:\n\n\u201cI was very pumped to go see the movie. Like ever since I first seen Angela Basset styling silvery white dreads, I knew I had to go see it,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOnce we arrived in Towson and just seeing people with African print skirts, dashikis, and Black affirmation shirts, I was so excited.\u201d\n\nBut that excitement soured later in the evening when, after some delays, attendees were told that all Black Panther screenings for that night would be canceled because of technical problems.

From myself and others.\u201d\n\nFilmgoers were given free movie passes for their trouble, but the event has some people scratching their heads.\n\nOne person who wrote to The Root said it was highly unlikely that the cinema would have issues with its reels, especially for a highly anticipated blockbuster that he points out had \u201csold out almost every show.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPatrick Kieley, a 31-year-old Towson native who, before working as an editor on movie trailers, worked in film distribution for five years, said that the digital cinema packages\u2014basically, the new film reels\u2014are always proofed when a theater receives them. For a blockbuster being shown on multiple screens, Kieley says, it\u2019s safe to assume that the theater would have backups.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way a large exhibitor like that would have technical issues at the last minute,\u201d Kieley said, adding that the whole thing \u201csmells really rotten.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo other film screenings were canceled, so it wasn\u2019t a theater-wide technical issue.

Designer Brandon Maxwell\u2019s newly launched Spring/Summer 2018 advertising campaign, starring British model Jourdan Dunn and her surprise date, is a follow-up to his two previous and equally stunning campaign videos featuring models Riley Montana and Joan Smalls.\n\nGorgeous clothes, perfect bodies and pretty faces are the least of what we\u2019re treated to in Maxwell\u2019s videos, written and directed by the designer himself in collaboration with his longtime creative partner, Jessy Price. Each is striking in its intimacy as Maxwell unzips the model mystique, allowing us to peer into the souls of the women he loves to dress.\n\nFashion has a fairy-tale quality to it, and it\u2019s an element illustrated by Maxwell\u2019s clothes juxtaposed against the backdrop of his models\u2019 everyday lives. In his most recent campaign, Dunn gets confessional about her own transformative journey into modeling and motherhood, both while she was still a teenager. Dunn\u2019s life as a mother lies at the center of her video, filmed with her own tiny Prince Charming, 8-year-old son Riley.\n\nIt\u2019s a pure fantasy of a mother-son scenario, but nonetheless one that speaks to the dream of how we all like to think of those magical days of childhood, a time when seeing your mother happy, dressed up and looking lovely\u2014along with an extra ride on the carousel and a second ice cream\u2014was, in fact, real magic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up caught up with Maxwell via Instagram while he was burning the midnight oil, creating his next collection\u2014only two weeks away from being presented at New York Fashion Week. For him, Dunn\u2019s campaign video expresses something very special:\n\nIt\u2019s not about who you are, nor how much you can provide for your child; it\u2019s about the relationship, the act of doing something together, the love of a mother and the safety you feel when she says to you through action, \u201cYou matter, I see you, and I love you, right where you are.\u201d\n\nIn Maxwell\u2019s Fall/Winter 2017 campaign video, superstrong Puerto Rican model Joan Smalls celebrated her career and craft. She tells us not so much about herself, but reminds us that we should not forget the humanity of people, no matter the package in which they come\u2014glamorous or otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrenched in sunlight, wearing a cocktail dress, Smalls displays the discipline of a soldier as a team of tailors pins the little black dress to fit Smalls\u2019 tight curves while she stands stock-still. Then she elegantly bursts to life, strutting across the floor and instantly giving us an inside look at the role models play in making runway creations a reality. In a quote from the company\u2019s website, Maxwell describes the feeling of Smalls\u2019 shoot:\n\nI wanted to capture the collection the way that I see it during fittings and during the creation process. It helps to better explain why I create the clothes that I do, which are meant to enhance a woman\u2019s personality, goals, talents and desires\u2014never to outshine her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDetroit-born Ebony Riley\u2014now better known as Riley Montana\u2014came to the model game late, after completing her nursing degree. Despite the fact that models age in dog years, Riley broke out of the pack and became a star with the love and support of designers like Riccardo Tisci, Tom Ford and, most of all, Brandon Maxwell, whom she refers to fondly as her \u201cfather.\u201d\n\nMaxwell\u2019s video portrait of Riley explores her cosmic destiny in down-to-earth terms, from her beginnings in Detroit to \u201c a new reality.\u201d That reality is the fashion business, where she was asked to become another version of herself; \u201cone that was more relatable and that didn\u2019t offend.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRiley, a foster child, takes us into the place she calls \u201chome,\u201d proudly showing every intimate, unidealized and precious detail of a family life full of warmth and love, in stark contrast with the devastated urban landscape that lies outside the family\u2019s door. In Riley\u2019s words, all of these were things \u201cthat I was once [was] taught to hide\u2014but they make me who I am.\u201d\n\nIn this urban fashion fairy tale, Cinderella rescues herself, embracing the struggle to excel while not assimilating. Maxwell says:\n\nI\u2019ve spent so much time with Riley, and we talked about our lives and similarities. I realized that she\u2019s the embodiment of the woman I design for.

I\u2019m one of those semi-road-warrior types who collects miles and points on my weekly trips in and around the United States to sit in meetings where I add marginal value, eat boxed lunches and internally critique PowerPoint font choices. I\u2019m TSA Precheck. I have airline status. I judge people\u2019s attire based on the ease with which they can pass through the security screening.\n\nLong story short, I spend a lot of time in airports. Honestly, I think airports are one of the truly fascinating places to people-watch because of the overall temporary nature of just about everyone there. Someone\u2019s leaving town, someone else is heading out on vacation. Another person just closed a deal, while the person beside them is hoping that they\u2019re gonna get that job. Interspersed in all of this are the people going to meet their grandkids for the first time and an occasional \u201cThis is my first time flying\u201d person.\n\nBut there we all are, together at the airport, traveling hither and yon, connected by a few minutes at the bar sipping our preferred form of preflight courage while checking smartphones and flight statuses and taking in the ever-ubiquitous presence of CNN on the airport TV screens.\n\nFor the most part, the conversations are benign:\n\n\u201cWhere ya headed?\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s home?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhaddya do?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long ya going for?\u201d\n\n\n\nUsually it\u2019s brief, a chat with a few laughs, some minor discoveries about each other, and then someone hops off their stool, downs the rest of the IPA and hightails it off to the gate to make their flight to Phoenix or Tulsa, Okla., or Newark, N.J.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as with any situation that involves booze, loose associations, acceptable generalizations, a somewhat diverse crowd and a TV screen showing a constant stream of CNN, sometimes the conversations can get a little contentious.\n\nA little while ago, I found myself in my usual spot at an airport bar after a long day of corporate tap dancing and professional mask-wearing, nursing a glass of Templeton Rye on the rocks and working my way through my usual grilled cheese sandwich with tomatoes, when I overheard two rather loud and somewhat intoxicated late-middle-aged white men accosting the TV screen and yammering on about that specific topic of the news and how that was specifically the thing that was destroying this country.\n\n\n\nI couldn\u2019t get the initial gist of their complaints, since I was kinda in my own world at the moment, but as I grasped what was on CNN and used context clues to put two and two together (shoutout to Ms. Pugh-Scott\u2019s second-grade class, y\u2019all), I realized that these men had been whipped into a frothy tirade over immigration. Namely, the fact that \u201ceveryone\u201d seemed so afraid to call these countries where all these immigrants and \u201cillegals\u201d (their words, not mine) came from the veritable \u201cshitholes\u201d that they are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSee, we used to call it the \u2018Third World,\u2019 and it was, you know, countries that might\u2019ve been poor or not as sophisticated as us, and so we wanted to reach out to them, maybe train some doctors from there, teach some of their folks how we do business here, and then they were supposed to go back home to build their own damn countries!\u201d\n\n\u201cYep. These people keep staying here because they know they don\u2019t want to go back to those Third World countries. But instead of going home and helping their own people, they wanna use chain migration and bring their brothers and sisters and all their kids, and eventually we got the whole damn village to support with OUR tax dollars. It\u2019s bullshit, if you ask me.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, I knew I should have just minded my own business, but the way my woke is set up, I couldn\u2019t let it pass without saying something. See, I come from an immigrant family myself, and as a Liberian, I know the Trump administration rescinded temporary protected status for many of my family and countrymen last May. My wife is an immigrant, as are her parents, and so our children are the only members of our family born in America. I work at a company full of immigrants. Hell, I had the self-awareness to see that the bartenders at the airport and the people running the food were also immigrants.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here we were, with me now forced to speak up in the face of willful ignorance and Fox News talking points with facts, logic and reason that these men were too old, too drunk and too white to accept. The irony notwithstanding that, in their defense of their own bigotry and self-serving view of Americanness, they shamelessly referenced the corpses of their own immigrant ancestors as if they had arrived on these shores welcomed with open arms and personally ready to start the tech companies and hedge funds of their day.\n\n\n\nAs the conversation teetered dangerously close to me having to call them the nativist racists that they were, and as the bar staff was becoming visually uncomfortable with their characterizations of \u201cthose Latinos,\u201d God intervened with an announcement that the flight to Dallas (or Houston, or Little Rock, Ark., or just generically Dixieland) was boarding and they ambled off their stools, shook my hand, and we wished each other safe travels. I mean, fuck those guys, but I\u2019m pretty sure everyone on their flight wasn\u2019t racist, and I wouldn\u2019t want them to suffer the karmic repercussions of the dumbass opinions of those two assholes.\n\nBut somehow, it got worse.\n\nAfter those men left, a youngish white couple, male and female, dressed in their vacation clothes, who had been sitting there all along, decided to chime in. But to, like, thank me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, my God. We heard what was going on over there, and it\u2019s just so refreshing to see someone actually, like, you know, speak up against those kinds of people.\u201d\n\nYeah, I mean, thanks, I guess, but that actually pissed me off even more: the fact that I, as the aggrieved party, had to speak up for myself and by extension those similarly situated around me (who were in no position to say anything), while Tad and Becca sat on the sidelines and offered only silence as support. I\u2019m sure that in their minds and in the story they\u2019d tell about the incident, they were on the right side of the argument and would pat themselves on the back for not sharing the opinions of the other two men at that bar.\n\nWhite people who want to be \u201callies\u201d need to understand that their agreement isn\u2019t enough. It\u2019s not enough for you to nod while I defend myself, or to bristle when something offensive is said or done to a member of a minority or marginalized community. Nah. There\u2019s just not enough of us to fight this battle alone, and if white people want to prove their worth in the struggle, they\u2019re going to need to speak the fuck up at the exact moment of the offense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOtherwise, it\u2019s just a different form of complicity. It\u2019s the decision to choose your own comfort over the discomfort of others. It\u2019s the purest form of privilege, and it needs to be treated with the same derision as abject and active racism. Otherwise, you\u2019re not an ally; you\u2019re just another enemy. You gotta pick a side and then you gotta actually work. Complicity is more dangerous than any outwardly racist act.\n\n\n\nOn the bright side, they did pay for my Templeton Rye on the rocks and my grilled cheese sandwich, so I guess they weren\u2019t all bad.", "keywords": ["world", "flight", "speak", "allies", "know", "white", "enemies", "airport", "dont", "men", "need", "going", "work", "im"], "polarity": 0.05962957875457874, "subjectivity": 0.4479105616605617},

Everything is about to change\u2014or so it seems\u2014as designers present fashion shows featuring clothes generally intended to break the rules. But one thing rarely, if ever, seems to change, and that\u2019s the absence of black designers occupying top spots in the fashion industry.\n\nFreelance designer and journalist Kibwe Chase-Marshall recently published an op-ed in Business of Fashion\u2014one of the most respected media outlets for fashion-industry reporting\u2014titled, \u201cWhy Aren\u2019t There More Black Designers?\u201d It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve asked myself nearly every time I\u2019ve gone into work over my 30-year career in fashion. Why?\n\nAll too often, I\u2019m the only person of color on set doing any job. The rare exception is on the catwalk, where the sheer number of people required to produce a fashion show calls for hiring more than one black person, simply by default. But when the final bow is taken, it is almost never a black designer who has the chance to receive either kudos or a career-ending critique from the press.\n\nChase-Marshall\u2014who worked in high-level but never top-tier jobs, such as vice president or head designer, for firms like Michael Kors, Isaac Mizrahi and Oscar de la Renta\u2014found himself repeatedly slamming up against a glass ceiling. And now he\u2019s breaking that glass ceiling by breaking the silence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Jan. 3, an action-oriented social media campaign, #BreakSilenceBreakCeilings, went live. The campaign was conceived by Chase-Marshall and aimed at breaking the unwritten and unspoken rule of discriminatory hiring practices in fashion, an industry that Chase-Marshall says does not have a \u201cdiversity problem\u201d but, rather, a \u201cblack-people problem.\u201d\n\nHimself a talented technical draftsman, stylist and cutter, Chase-Marshall is not content to simply illustrate the talent of black designers as a solution to the problem. In February, I was on a steering committee for the Black Designers Exhibition and Symposium at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, which shed light on the fierce beauty of too-little-seen talent and started the conversation as to why\u2014but did not offer us a plan to advance the battle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChase-Marshall has tailored a solution to fit the problem, noting in his op-ed, \u201cFed up with watching this most blatant form of discrimination thrive, while the broader industry capitalizes on Black celebrity associations and the recent uptick in Black casting, I decided to do something.\u201d\n\nChase-Marshall, who stopped working full time in design studios in 2010 after 13 years, now makes a living as a freelance designer and writer for publications like Elle. He has devised a plan of action for the Council of Fashion Designers of America and Vogue, which collaborate on the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund, the most powerful entity in the American\u2014if not global\u2014luxury-garment industry, which has promoted some of the most successful black designers in recent memory, such as Tracy Reese and Cushnie and Ochs.\n\nChase-Marshall would like to see CFDA/Vogue adopt a program with greater oversight of its design-industry members, such as offering immersive training for hiring managers in elimination of bias, along with CFDA/Vogue\u2019s annual disclosure and endorsement of participating brands, along with annual statistics regarding the racial composition of their design teams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s what the industry can do, but to consumers who want to take a stand against inequality and appropriation, Chase-Marshall posted:\n\nLet\u2019s do something: If you agree that it\u2019s time for the community of fashion design professionals to be taken to task regarding employment/advancement discrimination against qualified black candidates, along with liking this post, comment #breaksilencebreakceilings and tag @CFDA, @Voguemagazine, @Bof, @nytimes, and @wwd below. In addition, forward this post to 5 friends (or more) that you feel care to affect overdue change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlackness, until very recently, was seen as an unmarketable quality,\u201d says Chase-Marshall, who hails from Trinidad, was raised in Washington, D.C., and was a classmate of the Clinton and Gore children. But despite having the clubby connections to wealth and power that headhunters prize for their potential to move the needle when it comes to selling expensive designer clothing, he was discounted, simply because of the color of his skin.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if someone is racist,\u201d Chase-Marshall says. \u201cI care if people use discriminatory hiring practices.\u201d His is neither a call for affirmative action nor a call for quotas\u2014which can undercut recognition of real talent\u2014but, rather, a call for education transparency and accountability that can create lasting change within the fashion industry.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m proud of Chase-Marshall for pushing us beyond merely saying that we have the right to more than just exist and be seen in the fashion industry. It\u2019s our responsibility to demand, not only of fashion but also of our trendsetting selves, that our spending be reflected in the identities of the images marketed to us, as well as that our dollars come back into our communities through the black talent being paid and promoted according to their true worth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInspired by Muhammad Ali and Colin Kaepernick, Chase-Marshall, who currently engages in every type of freelance work, from designing pull-up diapers to diamond rings, wants to be the kind of person who \u201cprioritizes their integrity over their paycheck.\u201d He broke his silence \u201cbecause you can\u2019t continue to play a losing game.\u201d Now it\u2019s time for the powerful consumers black women are to suit up and make the fashion industry play ball.", "keywords": ["fashion", "black", "action", "industry", "simply", "designers", "chasemarshall", "missing", "problem", "designer", "talent", "hiring"], "polarity": 0.12858133650387174, "subjectivity": 0.4944134503993659},

My wife and I drove to Washington, D.C., after biking from Pittsburgh to Cumberland, Md., on a four-day and 150-mile trek that I still plan to write about eventually, but remain too traumatized by to write about yet.\n\nWe arrived Saturday evening, went out and stayed the night with the friends we made the bike trip with, and had all of Sunday in D.C. before flying back to Pittsburgh Monday morning. We decided to try to visit \u201cthe Blacksonian\u201d since neither of us had been.\n\nBut, as we quickly learned, if you\u2019re not on any waiting lists (and we weren\u2019t), the only way to get same-day tickets is to get up at the butt crack of dawn and check online (which we didn\u2019t do). Plus, it was the Sunday before Labor Day, which meant the National Mall would be even busier than usual, and any chance of scoring walk-up tickets would be scarce.\n\nRunning out of options, I made a Facebook status about our predicament and asked if anyway knew of any other way. Luckily, one of my friends messaged me that veterans can get into Smithsonian museums whenever they want, and since her dad is a vet, he\u2019d meet us there and get us in.\n\nI connected with her dad and agreed to meet him in front of the museum at 3 p.m. When I asked how we\u2019d know it was him, he replied in a typical 75-year-old black-man way: \u201cYou won\u2019t miss me. I\u2019ll be the handsomest man there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, he was right. We saw him near the entrance where we agreed to meet. Decked out in an exquisitely tailored charcoal-gray suit, black-and-gray oxfords and a burgundy bowtie, he immediately reminded me of Ossie Davis.\n\nWe introduced ourselves, shook his hand and thanked him, and he replied, \u201cNot a problem. It\u2019s my pleasure.\u201d\n\nWe spoke for a couple more minutes, and we learned that he\u2019d just left church and post-church brunch with his family\u2014which is probably why he was so extra-super sharp\u2014and that he fulfills this request for people frequently. When we apologized for interrupting his day, he corrected us: \u201cNo. I consider this a duty.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you enter the Blacksonian, the guides suggest that you start at the basement (which is where the time spanning the trans-Atlantic slave trade is documented and displayed) and work your way back up to the top floor. The museum was packed, so we had to wait in line to get on an elevator that would take us down there. There were a few dozen people in front of us, but the line moved swiftly and efficiently, and we were on the elevator within 10 minutes.\n\nThe basement was everything you\u2019d expect an entire floor devoted to the hundreds of years that black people were in bondage in America would be. It was fucking heavy. And hard. And scary. And sad. Even now, six months after I was on that floor, the thought of it heats and wells my eyes. Some people were crying. Others just staring, silent and blank and sad and seething, at the exhibits. Some of those who brought young children were attempting to educate them while also visibly fighting the urge not to be overcome by emotion. And everyone was respectful of the weight and the temperature of that room.\n\n\n\nWell, mostly everyone.\n\nThe crowd was maybe 70 percent percent black. And those who didn\u2019t happen to be black appeared to be just as moved by what was being experienced. But there was one 40-something white man there who, on at least three separate occasions, bumped into other museumgoers while he was attempting to take pictures and text.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey weren\u2019t egregious or violent bumps; he didn\u2019t knock anyone off balance. But they were the type of bumps where you\u2019d look up after being bumped because you\u2019d expect that person to stop what he was doing and apologize. Which is exactly what each person did after being bumped.\n\nNo apology came, however, as this guy was too transfixed with his phone to even notice. In a different environment, this type of social faux pas around black people would have induced at least a couple of \u201cUm. Excuse you\u201ds. Instead, he was just met by head shakes and looks of disgust. They weren\u2019t going to let him ruin their experience.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, I joined my friend Deesha Philyaw onstage at the Summit Against Racism for a talk titled, \u201cHow Not to Be a Racist Shithead.\u201d For 45 minutes, we addressed the predominantly white audience of 300, and basically just spent our time finding different ways to say, \u201cWhite people, you need to do better.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToward the end of our talk, I brought up the idea that white people need to learn how to be guests. If you are in someone else\u2019s house and they ask you to take off your shoes before stepping onto their floor, you take off your shoes. And if you are the type of person who usually wears shoes without socks, do your research and put some fucking socks on before you leave your house.\n\nIt\u2019s a concept many white people seem to struggle with. That not all things are theirs. And that some things will never have owners because they cannot be owned. And some things belong to other people. And whether those things are dialects or music or histories or actual bodies, that a proper reverence for them must be possessed before engaging with them.\n\nWhen thinking about this, I can\u2019t help thinking about that day at the Blacksonian. And all of the things we had to do that day just to get tickets. And that beautiful man helping us out, as he\u2019s helped others, because he knows how important it is for that space to be witnessed and experienced. And the rows of (mostly black) people, waiting patiently and anxiously to be taken to a floor displaying the horrors our ancestors were forced through. And the faces of the people engaging with those exhibits. The sadness and the anger and the shock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then this white guy, either oblivious to or just not giving a shit about his surroundings, bumping into people.

Luckily, our editor-in-chief, Danielle Belton, was able to score tickets so that we could be there to give you our impressions of the film. (Although we\u2019re not too spoilery, if you\u2019re afraid to know too much, it might be better to see the movie first.)\n\n\n\nDanielle Belton, Editor-in-Chief\n\nFor most of Black Panther, I couldn\u2019t believe what I was watching. An African nation that was never colonized? Two black women talking to each other about their mission and not, I dunno, either not talking at all or talking about a man? Moments that went on forever where no white characters spoke, or where they were summarily chastised for speaking? Black women who were fully realized characters with agency and their own beliefs? Black men who were completely confident and actualized in their ideals, even if the viewpoints were opposing and varied? A cinematic parallel for the real-world tensions and conflicts that often exist between Africans and African Americans? Black people who were the victors and not victims? What!\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat did I just watch?\u201d was all I could think after I saw it, but in a good way\u2014but also in a sad way, in that I\u2019m 40 and a lifelong movie lover who\u2019s seen almost every clich\u00e9 in cinema; but Black Panther took clich\u00e9 and chucked it off a waterfall, making me wonder why Hollywood is so lazy and often afraid of new ideas that it took this long to see a black film like this, on this scale.\n\nBut ultimately, I want to see more. I want there to be a sequel (I\u2019d love to see where things go in Wakanda after the actions of this film), but I also want there to be more blockbuster movies that take risks and tell new stories. Lastly, I want people to respect assigned seating in theaters. One dude in our theater almost ruined the entire movie because he did not want to find his ... probably crappy ... seat. But nobody has time for this game of seat leap frog. Not today.\n\n\n\nGenetta M. Adams, Managing Editor\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been this hyped for a movie. And in this age when the most eager fans can line up the night before the official opening to see a movie, I\u2019ve rarely felt the urge to be among the first paying customers to see a film\u2014until now.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the splendor and beauty of Wakanda washed over me, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what Africa would\u2019ve looked like if it had never been invaded by colonizers. What if the continent\u2019s vast riches were never stolen and the plunder of black bodies never happened? Black Panther offers the best version of that possibility.\n\n\n\nThe eye-popping fashion was even more amazing on the big screen (and if costume designer Ruth E. Carter isn\u2019t nominated for ALL the awards, I\u2019m boycotting award shows forever). And the storyline (again, the screenplay and director Ryan Coogler better be up for ALL the awards) is so timely and relevant that I actually felt empathy for the \u201cvillain\u201d Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan).\n\n\n\nAnd though the movie is called Black Panther, it is the black women of Wakanda\u2014from the fiercest warriors of the Dora Milaje to Shuri (Letitia Wright), the brilliant scientist who develops Wakanda\u2019s tech (and delivers the funniest lines in the movie), and the calm, regal beauty of Queen Mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett)\u2014who give the movie its heart. I wish my 12-year-old self could have seen such badass black women so prominently featured in a big-budget action movie. And I know that 12-year-old black girls who see the movie today will feel inspired and empowered by these black women, and encouraged to pursue their dreams, no matter what.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLook for me in the line as I hit the theater a few more times to bask in the glorious world of Wakanda.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nAngela Helm, Contributing Editor\n\nI was hopeful but a little bit afraid of the hype surrounding Black Panther (see Empire three years ago). I shouldn\u2019t have been. It was every single thing. Big-budget action. Drama. Comic relief. And an all-encompassing, well-lit blackness that flew off the screen and overwhelmed my senses.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere will be much said about Killmonger, a complicated character who had one of the most powerful lines of the film (I gasped when he said it, and then threw a hand in the air), but what I loved most about him was that although he graduated from the Naval Academy at 19 and went to MIT, he was still so Oakland with his gold teeth and unrepentant brilliance.\n\n\n\nThe white gaze was nonexistent. This was for us, by us and quite possibly a game changer for cinema. I cannot wait for my unborn grandchildren to see it. Wakanda forever.\n\nCorey Townsend, Weekend Social Editor\n\nOne word: FASHION! The looks that were served in Black Panther sent me into a state of euphoria. The bold patterns served as a reminder that color was indeed invented for those with melanin.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe movie also served as a reminder that the world would be lost without black women!\n\nTerrell Jermaine Starr, Senior Reporter\n\nAs soon as I stepped out of the movie theater, I was no longer in Wakanda. And that made me sad. I was forced to share an UberPool with two colonizers. I wanted to yell \u201cColonizers!\u201d and ask them for their tourist visas, but I could not. We weren\u2019t in Wakanda. Nor am I Shuri. I am joking, but I\u2019m really not.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more than two hours, I was surrounded by blackness, consumed with a power of self and possibility I\u2019d never experienced during a film. For two hours, whiteness was not centered. I was. It was challenging to wrestle with that reality and the possibilities of such a world because I was born into a reality where whiteness is the default. My struggles, my successes, my dreams are all predicated on fending off and negotiating with whiteness. In Wakanda, whiteness negotiates with me and has few options but to comply.\n\nThat is a wonderful feeling. I have never watched a Marvel film\u2014nor am I a comics fan\u2014but that has changed. Black Panther left me with a buoyancy about what our current world strives to make impossible: a world centered in blackness, our existence. There are no bells and whistles to Wakanda. It just was. For two hours, so was I. I just was.\n\nNow I am in America, where just being is a struggle. I long for Wakanda.\n\nDanielle Young, Producer\n\nThis is my second time seeing Black Panther, and it won\u2019t be my last. My emotions are not done with this movie. It not only lives up to the epic hype but also pens the only love letter to Diasporic blackness that you\u2019ll ever need. When I got a chance to watch the movie the first time, I wrote a spoiler-free review that allowed me to dig into the black pride this movie undeniably gifts you. Watching T\u2019Challa\u2019s (Chadwick Boseman) baby sister, Shuri, bounce around her lab, brilliantly leading Wakanda\u2019s tech, made me feel like a little girl watching her new role model. Representation matters, and there\u2019s nothing quite like showing little black girls and boys that tech is a possibility for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are just so many good parts, pieces, moments, visuals, everything, but Killmonger is another standout. Obviously, Michael B. Jordan is ribbed for our pleasure, but his portrayal of a villain is delicious. His character is so well-rounded, so wounded and almost right in his attempt to dethrone King T\u2019Challa. And having his character represent black America in the sense of longing to reach home, the Motherland, was so uncomfortably beautiful. The only thing I have left to say about Black Panther is thank you for ...\u201dcolonizer.\u201d\n\nP.J. Rickards, Video Producer\n\nI\u2019ve been taking my 12-year-old son to see superhero movies for years now. It\u2019s definitely his thing: the opening, big action scenes, the one-liners, the larger-than-life graphics and the excitement after. It hit me while watching Black Panther: We\u2019re going to share that with a movie about a black superhero, strong black characters in a remarkable, all-black world. I already felt that way after seeing the trailer, but it was a whole other thing when I got to finally experience the full movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll I could think about was how he would react at certain parts and the discussions it could open up. And to see it with black people proud and dressed up. It reminded me a bit of the level of pride when Malcolm X came out and everyone was wearing X hats and dashikis. You could tell it was made with love by people of color for our people. It also made me hopeful that this will continue to be a regular occurrence, and even though it\u2019s a big deal for the grown-ups, the impact on young people growing up might be greater than we think.\n\nJason Johnson, Politics Editor\n\nI still don\u2019t know what the heck I saw, and I\u2019ve seen the movie three times. All I know is that I was fighting back thug tears every time Killmonger spoke, and this might\u2019ve been the first time in my life that I sat in a mostly black theater and people only made noise at the appropriate times. The other thing I know is this: it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s week and Black History Month, so if you bought us Black Panther tickets this weekend, we go together \u2026.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAshley Velez, Digital Video Producer\n\nBlack Panther made me feel so many things. I\u2019ve shouted \u201cWakanda forever!\u201d too many times to count since last night. Not only was Black Panther visually stunning\u2014from the cinematography to the lighting and costume design\u2014but the writing was also incredibly executed and engaging. It created space for film watchers to have meaningful dialogue surrounding things like generational trauma, conflicting methods of liberation, and identity throughout the Diaspora. Nothing about how these themes was presented felt forced, which is where modern films and television tend to drop the ball.\n\nI really appreciated the fact that Black Panther didn\u2019t feel like it solely revolved around T\u2019Challa\u2019s mental and physical conflicts. The bulk of the characters were elevated in sincere ways. Because of this, I was able to connect with multiple characters throughout the film. I still can\u2019t decide if I want to be Okoye (Danai Gurira), Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) or Shuri! That alone speaks to the significance of how black women were portrayed throughout the film.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh yeah, listen to the soundtrack again after watching the movie! I appreciated it so much more!\n\n\n\nA final note: If you\u2019re a colonizer, I feel bad for you, son.\n\nPsych. No, I don\u2019t.\n\nAnne Branigin, News Fellow\n\nBefore the film, I kept thinking about how Black Panther came out almost a year after Get Out. Wakanda is in some ways the antithesis of \u201cthe sunken place.\u201d Where the latter expressed a loss of control\u2014being at the mercy of \u201cbenevolent\u201d whiteness\u2014Wakanda represents liberation and self-determination in a powerful way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mother\u2019s country has been colonized twice: first by the Spanish, then by the U.S. Although one of our national heroes killed one of the world\u2019s greatest colonizers, Ferdinand Magellan, the enduring evidence of their actions is in our names, food, features, vocabulary. I love how Black Panther imagines a land written off as a Third World country as being, instead, a superpower\u2014a land free from colonization and subjugation. I love the questions it asks\u2014about what we could be if we got to keep the most precious parts of ourselves, and about the responsibility associated with that.\n\n", "keywords": ["world", "wakanda", "black", "night", "forever", "went", "movie", "panther", "opening", "film", "live", "thing", "women", "watching", "love"], "polarity": 0.11046091495310241, "subjectivity": 0.48518148518148513},

(Credit: ABC News)\n\nHow Supremacist Trolls Spread Rumors to Media\n\n\u201cFollowing misrepresentations by a white nationalist leader and coordinated efforts by internet trolls, numerous researchers and media outlets spread a seemingly false claim that the man charged with killing more than a dozen people at a Florida high school belonged to an extremist group,\u201d Shawn Musgrave reported Friday for Politico.\n\n\u201cLaw enforcement agencies say they have no evidence so far to support this claim, and the rumor appears to have been perpetrated by white nationalist trolls themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOn Thursday afternoon, the Anti-Defamation League reported that a white supremacist group claimed ties with Nikolas Cruz, who confessed to the shooting spree that killed at least 17 people, including many high-school students, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.\n\n\u201c \u2018A spokesperson for the white supremacist group Republic of Florida (ROF) told the Anti-Defamation League on Thursday, February 15, that Nikolas Cruz [....] was associated with his group,\u2019 the ADL reported. The ADL quoted a man named Jordan Jereb, who runs the small group, which is based in Tallahassee.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018Jereb added that ROF had not ordered or wanted Cruz to do anything like the school shooting,\u2019 the ADL wrote in a blog post that was quickly picked up by ABC News and The Associated Press, and later percolated through dozens of other media outlets. Even The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, picked up the claim\n\n\u201cSome outlets reported they had their own conversations with Jereb or classmates of Cruz who allegedly corroborated the association of Cruz with ROF.\n\n\u201cBut a few hours later, after law enforcement agencies said they had no evidence linking Cruz to ROF, Jereb said his identification of Cruz was a \u2018misunderstanding\u2019 and that he, too, had been the subject of a \u2018prank.\u2019 On online forums and Twitter, trolls and white nationalists gloated at the disinformation they had sowed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018All of our evidence seems to point to the ADL getting this wrong,\u2019 said Joan Donovan, a researcher who tracks online misinformation campaigns for Data & Society, a think tank in New York City.\n\n\u201cThe ADL subsequently revised its report, as did many news outlets. . . .\u201d\n\nAssociated Press: White nationalist leader walks back comments that shooting suspect was group member\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJarvis DeBerry, NOLA.com | Times-Picayune: The numbing effect of multiple school shootings\n\nEditorial, Daily News, New York: Trump shoots blanks: He offers condolences but empty platitudes in the wake of South Florida\u2019s school massacre\n\nEditorial, Miami Herald: Yes, \u2018it\u2019 happened here.

Black Panther, who finds himself in a battle against an army led by the man who killed his father. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDaniels quoted Holland, \u201c \u2018One of the things that I have learned throughout this process is that the world has such rich stories that haven\u2019t been told yet,\u2019 he said. \u2018One of the things that writing these books does for me is it reminds me when I go to work every day that what we do as journalists is that we tell stories. We bring the hidden to light.\n\n\u201cJust like the \u2018Black Panther\u2019 movie and this novel does, they\u2019re bringing the character to light that some people knew about, and some people appreciated, but now through this novel and the movie, the entire world gets to know about it.\u2019\n\n\u201c \u2018. . .

The website projects it will earn $178 million over three days.\n\n\u201cThat would be enough to put it in the upper range of the top 10 highest grossing openings for a superhero movie. At that level, Black Panther would top heavyweights such as Batman, Superman and Spider-Man and take aim at the best-ever debut for a superhero movie focused on a solo character.\n\n\u201cStrong reviews, outstanding pre-sales and a holiday weekend release underpin the bullish forecast, but it might be the revolutionary nature of the film that pushes it beyond consensus estimates, said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at boxoffice.com. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGene Demby, NPR \u201cCode Switch\u201d: Can Marvel\u2019s New Superhero Bear The Weight Of Representation?\n\nJohn Eligon; Kwame Opam; Carvell Wallace; Crystal Martin; Walter Thompson-Hernandez; Mekado Murphy; Manohla Dargis and A.O.

Keep the political commentary to yourself or, as someone once said, shut up and dribble.\u2019\n\n\u201cIngraham got a lot of blowback over this, including from Dwyane Wade and Chris Long. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHeather Dockray, Mashable: LeBron fires back on Instagram after Laura Ingraham tells him to \u2018Shut up\u2019\n\nMartenzie Johnson, the Undefeated: What Laura Ingraham\u2019s attack on LeBron James really means\n\nPhil Thompson, Chicago Tribune: Kyle Long claps back at Fox News\u2019 Laura Ingraham for LeBron James criticism\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColumnist Says Black History Month Has Failed\n\n\u201cBlack History Month wasn\u2019t created for white people, so maybe it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that it has colossally failed to foster a broader understanding and appreciation among whites for how African Americans helped make this nation great,\u201d Harold Jackson, editorial page editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer, wrote in a column Friday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t make it less disappointing.\n\n\n\n\u201cHistorian Carter G. Woodson came up with the idea of Negro History Week in 1926. He chose the week that included the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln, Feb. 12, and Frederick Douglass, Feb. 14.\n\n\u201cInitially, only North Carolina, Delaware, West Virginia, Baltimore, Md., and Washington, D.C., signed on to the idea \u2014 and only for their black schools, which is exactly what Woodson wanted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSegregation, by law or tradition, was prevalent in the 1920s. Woodson never envisioned white students learning black history. His concern was that black students, deprived of a thorough education about their ancestors, would grow up accepting the yoke of inferiority that white people insisted they wear. . . .\u201d\n\nJackson also wrote, \u201cNegro History Week was ours alone, but Black History Month became something else. Inspired by the black power movement, black students at Kent State University organized the first Black History Month in 1970. The idea caught on and in 1976 President Gerald Ford included Black History Month as part of the nation\u2019s bicentennial celebration.\n\n\u201cWith segregation gone, more schools reserved time each February to study the contributions of prominent African Americans in history \u2014 from Denmark Vesey to Thurgood Marshall to Barack Obama. But unfortunately, learning names, dates, and events was typically as far as their studies went. Too often the necessary attention to context and relevancy was missing from the lessons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat lack of historical context was evident in the results of a study released in January by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which showed only 8 percent of high school seniors knew slavery was the main cause of the Civil War. Two-thirds didn\u2019t know it took a constitutional amendment to end slavery. That\u2019s a sorry testament to how history is being taught in America\u2019s schools.\n\n\u201cInstead of going beyond Woodson\u2019s original idea to focus on the positive contributions of individual African Americans, too many schools use Black History Month as a vehicle to teach a catalog of events and people without making tangible connections to the status of black Americans today.\n\n\u201cOne result is white Americans who don\u2019t believe slavery has anything to do with today\u2019s United States. Neither their regular history classes nor any additional study they may have done during Black History Month helped them connect the dots among slavery, segregation, and the poverty found in too many black communities today. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid W.

For me, that word defines Serena Williams. I love her body\u2014it\u2019s invincible. I also love that none of her seemingly superhuman attributes were given to her or easily attained. Everything she has, she earned, one drop of sweat at a time. She and big sister Venus were their own mini-civil-rights movement as they fought to establish their place on the predominantly white tennis circuit, and they have dominated for nearly two decades.\n\nBecoming the mother to gorgeous baby girl Alexis Olympia\u2014who shares her February cover of Vogue magazine\u2014was no less a struggle than any of Williams\u2019 other feats; she came straight out of Compton, Calif., to be crowned the Best Athlete of All Time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs told to Vogue, Williams\u2014newly married to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian\u2014was blessed with an easy pregnancy (as expected, given her supreme physical condition). But delivering the other cover girl on this month\u2019s Vogue was ultimately a \u201charrowing experience.\u201d Call it bad luck, but as her baby\u2019s heart rate plummeted dangerously low during birth, Williams required an emergency cesarean section.\n\nTo make matters worse, the new mother suffered a recurrence of blood clots\u2014a condition that flared up hours after the C-section that left Williams gasping for air and fearing that she was having another pulmonary embolism. After she advocated for herself and insisted on a CT scan and a blood thinner, another emergency surgery was performed to insert a filter into a major vein to clear up abdominal bleeding (a side effect of blood-thinning medication). To add to the drama, her C-section incision then ruptured because of the intense coughing caused by the blood clot. Our mighty Serena was left flat on her back for a full six weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThankfully, mother and daughter are now more than fine. Serena is up and naturally winning again, with a new clothing line launching on her website in March, serial investments in tech companies owned or led by black women, and a new home in Silicon Valley.\n\nIs she done with tennis? Not by a long shot. Twenty-three grand slams already have her name on them, and she\u2019s looking to own 25 in total, making her the greatest tennis player of all time (24 is the current record held by Australian Margaret Court).\n\nAs for motherhood, Williams only believes it ups her game, telling Vogue:\n\nKnowing I\u2019ve got this beautiful baby to go home to makes me feel like I don\u2019t have to play another match. I don\u2019t need the money or the titles or the prestige. I want them, but I don\u2019t need them. That\u2019s a different feeling for me ... It\u2019s interesting. ... There hasn\u2019t been a clear number one since I was there. It will be cool to see if I get there again, to what I call my spot\u2014where I feel I belong. I don\u2019t play to be the second best or the third best. If there\u2019s no clear number one, it\u2019s like, yeah, I can get my spot back.

Do they throw an off-step show every year for the fraternities and sororities?\n\nOnce, at a Denny\u2019s around 3 a.m. in Goose Creek, S.C., while watching a 52-year-old white dude mop up a drunken white sorority girl\u2019s grits-vomit, I wondered what kind of crazy Caucasian hijinks he was involved in that led to waiting tables during the graveyard shift at a pancake restaurant, when he has every societal advantage and privilege. I mean, he was white! The throw-up girl wasn\u2019t even with me, but as I watched him roll that canary-yellow industrial mop bucket filled with water the color of disappointment and bad decisions, I said a silent prayer for that waiter, and then I told him I was sorry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike I said, I am apologetically black.\n\n\n\nThe St. Cloud State Student Union Facebook page seems to be disliked by most people, and the college and the city of St. Cloud have condemned the posters. Not because they are racist, but because the signs violate the town ordinance against stapling things to telephone poles. What would they expect from those thugs?\n\nBut for the record, I stand with the White Student Union. Someone has to do it.

It was a warm, caring and very emotional speech that we know wasn\u2019t heartfelt because he expressed his true feelings on Twitter around 4 this morning:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTranslation: It\u2019s the students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 fault that the shooting occurred, and they should have screamed about this dangerous kid more. But the fact is, the FBI was warned last year about how Nikolas Cruz posted that he wanted to be a professional school shooter!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the president spoke Thursday around 11:30 a.m. EST, he took all of six-and-a-half-minutes to address the tragedy. That\u2019s less time than he took to rant about NFL players kneeling; that\u2019s less time than he took to praise alleged wife beater and former White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter; that\u2019s barely more time than it takes for Doug E. Fresh to go on.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t name any of the victims; nor did he praise the brave students or teachers. He spent most of his limited time giving an \u201cafter-school special\u201d lecture about how you never need to be alone in high school\u2014and if you\u2019re sad, there is someone you should reach out to. It was a speech seemingly intended to touch the heart of the next shooter out there who apparently just needs a hug in order to not murder his classmates.\n\nMind you, if this wasn\u2019t the most divisive president in the history of presidents, then maybe his entreaties for peace and love would make a difference, but he is who he is, so his pleas don\u2019t hold weight and they won\u2019t change anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most glaring part of the speech came at the end, when the president pledged that America must \u201ctackle the difficult issue of mental health.\u201d He didn\u2019t say \u201cguns\u201d once in his speech. Trump took pains to make no mention of guns. If Tim Gunn had jumped in front of him, ripped off his well-tailored sleeves, flexed and screamed, \u201cWhat do you think of these??\u201d Trump would still have found a way to say, \u201cHow\u2019s that mental health going?\u201d\n\nMental health has become the ultimate red herrng for Republicans who don\u2019t want to talk about guns no matter who gets shot, or how bloody or egregious and avoidable the crime may have been. The country is full of people with \u201cmental health problems,\u201d and they aren\u2019t shooting up schools every week. You know who is shooting up schools and nightclubs and office buildings every week? People who are legally allowed to buy AR-15s. Fix that problem and maybe we can stop with the disingenuous chorus of tweets citing \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d every 60 hours.\n\nAlas, we know that Trump won\u2019t do anything; nor will Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell or House Speaker Paul Ryan. When Republicans can get shot up at their own baseball game and still refuse to pass meaningful gun legislation, there\u2019s no reason to think that another shooting of innocent kids will spur them to action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as student survivor David Hogg just told CNN, somebody has to act like adults.\n\nSince Trump isn\u2019t an adult, and neither are the Republicans in Congress, it\u2019s time for the public to act like adults and vote these gun-fetishizing incompetents out of office this fall\u2014and then demand some real change.", "keywords": ["speech", "health", "thats", "trump", "listened", "school", "cares", "shootings", "pretend", "dont", "president", "republicans", "mental", "shooting", "took"], "polarity": 0.08694761904761902, "subjectivity": 0.45011904761904753},

In 1999 she developed designer Giorgio Armani\u2019s makeup line\u2014in my opinion, still one of the top three foundation formulations and shade ranges on the market. In 2004 she was named creative director of Procter & Gamble cosmetics, which includes lines like SK-II, Dolce & Gabbana and CoverGirl. In 2013 Queen Elizabeth II named McGrath an MBE, or Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the fashion and beauty industries.\n\nMcGrath finally founded her own eponymous collection in 2015 based around highly pigmented lipsticks and eye shadows.

Aside from the fact that everyone, including family members, was mysteriously kept away from the Turpin home and the fact that David had racked up $500,000 in debt despite earning six figures as an engineer at Northrop Grumman, the couple looked like they should have been investigated. Even though Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan has repeatedly warned me never to trust men with bangs, if I saw these motherfuckers in line at Target, I\u2019d call the 911 immediately.\n\nI don\u2019t believe in racial profiling, but if the operator asked me what was wrong, I\u2019d tell him or her: \u201cLook, I know these white people have someone chained up at the crib. I can just feel it!\u201d\n\nBut back to the fascinating plot of Taken 2: Wypipo Boogaloo.\n\nEarly Sunday morning, a 17-year-old daughter of the Turpins escaped from her shackles, slipped out of a window and dialed 911 on a cellphone that had been deactivated. When she met authorities, she showed them pictures of her brothers and sisters who were being held captive by her parents, according to the Washington Post\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Riverside County, Calif., Sheriff\u2019s Department looked at the girl\u2019s cellphone photos and decided to perform a welfare check on the home. When officers arrived at the Perris, Calif., home, they discovered 12 of the girl\u2019s siblings all chained to beds throughout the house.\n\nAt first the cops thought they had found a bunch of mistreated children, but it turns out that most of the captive Turpin siblings (ranging in age from 2 to 29) were adults and were so egregiously malnourished that cops assumed that they were kids. In fact, the officers initially estimated that the 17-year-old who escaped was only 10 years old.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could actually write most of this article with my eyes closed because, before I was assigned this story, I was up in the wee hours of the morning reading about it. Besides being fascinated by the shenanigans of weird Caucasians, my thirst for understanding has always revolved around one central question:\n\n\n\nWhy are white people like this?\n\nI don\u2019t ask that question rhetorically or with an attempt at humor. I have a serious need to know. I stayed up into the wee hours of the morning investigating this story with no expectation of ever writing about it. I wanted to know for myself, but now that the editorial team at The Root has involved you in my search for answers, here\u2019s what I found at the bottom of the rabbit hole I descended into:\n\nThe Turpins have 13 children and have been married for more than 30 years; they renewed their vows in 2015, according to their Facebook page.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from their affinity for bangs and Wrangler jeans, they are deeply religious and adhered to the principles of the small-but-growing Christian sect called \u201cQuiverFull.\u201d\n\n\n\nI can hear you asking: \u201cWhat the hell is QuiverFull?\u201d (I have a very good internet connection.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, you can make a QuiverFull souffl\u00e9 all by yourself! All you have to do is take the \u201calt-right,\u201d white supremacist belief of the white genocide movement, sprinkle in a little Christian fundamentalism and\u2014voil\u00e0! You\u2019ve now created a brand-new brand of religious philosophy based on Psalms 127:3-5:\n\n3. Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his reward. 4. As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth. 5. Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuiverFull is based on the belief that, like pure white people, good Christians are going out of style because they are being outbred by sinners. The only way for God\u2019s people to build an army of Christian conservatives for the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is by abstaining from birth control and ... you guessed it: fucking.\n\nThe Duggar family from TLC\u2019s 17 Kids and Counting are one of the more prominent adherents of the QuiverFull philosophy, which borrows much of its ideology from the 1985 book The Way Home, by Mary Pride. The book basically says that feminism has wrongly led women to believe that they can achieve happiness without being married, submitting to their husbands and having children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, it\u2019s the belief that women have been indoctrinated with the stupid idea that washing dishes and being obedient to their husbands is not the path to happiness. According to believers, birth control and independence are toxic ideas pushed by the subversive feminist movement to destroy God\u2019s people. (I\u2019m paraphrasing here, but not by much.)\n\nThe movement is estimated to have tens of thousands of adherents, mostly in the United States, and has been plagued by accusations of sexual abuse. Apparently, being fruitful and multiplying has a few negative effects.\n\nMany QuiverFull members, like the Turpins, homeschool their children, which explains why no one noticed the lack of nutrition. The grandparents of the children told reporters that the children memorized long biblical passages during their strict homeschooling, and neighbors stated that the children always looked \u201cvery pale,\u201d according to The Telegraph.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Turpins have been charged with torture and child endangerment. Their bail has been set at $9 million apiece, according to CNN.

The country is full of people with \u201cmental health problems,\u201d and they aren\u2019t shooting up schools every week. You know who is shooting up schools and nightclubs and office buildings every week? People who are legally allowed to buy AR-15s. Fix that problem and maybe we can stop with the disingenuous chorus of tweets citing \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d every 60 hours.\n\nAlas, we know that Trump won\u2019t do anything; nor will Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell or House Speaker Paul Ryan. When Republicans can get shot up at their own baseball game and still refuse to pass meaningful gun legislation, there\u2019s no reason to think that another shooting of innocent kids will spur them to action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as student survivor David Hogg just told CNN, somebody has to act like adults.\n\nSince Trump isn\u2019t an adult, and neither are the Republicans in Congress, it\u2019s time for the public to act like adults and vote these gun-fetishizing incompetents out of office this fall\u2014and then demand some real change.", "keywords": ["speech", "health", "thats", "trump", "listened", "school", "cares", "shootings", "pretend", "dont", "president", "republicans", "mental", "shooting", "took"], "polarity": 0.08694761904761902, "subjectivity": 0.45011904761904753},

During a speech Thursday at a sheriffs\u2019 convention in Washington, D.C., Sessions found a way to bring up criminal records and gang violence while addressing Wednesday\u2019s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., that killed 17 people.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think effective enforcement of our gun laws, focusing on criminals and dangerous people, mentally ill people that have been\u2014where we have the legal ability to do so\u2014can reduce violence in our communities and improve public safety,\u201d Sessions said, ThinkProgress reports. \u201cIt is not good if we got gun laws that say criminals can\u2019t carry guns and they never get enforced. So we intend to enforce our laws.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomeone might want to let Sessions know that Nikolas Cruz, the accused gunman in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School mass shooting, purchased his gun legally, which proves that current gun laws might be ineffective.\n\nBut Sessions wouldn\u2019t be Sessions if he didn\u2019t find a way to bring up gang violence\u2014which, unless Sessions is talking about the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d gang, which Cruz appeared to belong to, really has no place in this discussion.\n\n\u201cWhen parents once again go to sleep fearful that their kids will not be safe, even when they go to school\u2014parents have told me in gang-infested neighborhoods that children can no longer stand at the bus stop by themselves\u2014they take turns, parents do, of being out there every morning and afternoon,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve gotta confront the problem. There\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI guess it doesn\u2019t matter to Sessions that Parkland is not a place terrorized by gang violence.

If I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d think that the current administration emboldens this brand of hate and then preys on white America\u2019s fear by pulling out tired tropes about gang violence to avoid the obvious issues of homegrown hate and unbridled access to guns.\n\nWatch below:", "keywords": ["symphony", "sessions", "speech", "gang", "nonsensical", "gun", "know", "parkland", "way", "violence", "school", "think", "racist", "laws", "whistles", "florida", "shooting", "jeff"], "polarity": -0.06926666666666667, "subjectivity": 0.5059333333333333},

I love wax prints (yes, I know they\u2019re actually Dutch/Indonesian), indigo mudcloth, Coptic crosses and Moroccan wedding blankets, and happen to be writing this while sitting under a red Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9 feather headdress gifted to me by a godmother who regularly visits the continent. I was born into that generation of children given African names by newly \u201cwoke\u201d parents (mine borrowed from the title of a Miles Davis song). And I may have rocked an African medallion in the early \u201990s, and head wraps well before Erykah Badu dropped her debut single.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s 2017, and I have no intention of attending a kinara-lighting ceremony looking like I\u2019m wearing a Kwanzaa costume. I\u2019m also not immune to the argument that there\u2019s a measure of appropriation in the way many of us approach wearing African fashion, as posited in 2015 by writer Zipporah Gene.\n\nWhile Gene\u2019s argument had a few holes, in an era in which African-inspired fashions and decor have reached peak popularity, it\u2019s well worth ongoing consideration and discussion of where the appreciation of our mother culture began and how to ensure it doesn\u2019t cross the appropriative line. As writer Nadra Nittle noted, in response to Gene\u2019s thesis:\n\nDonning dashikis, rejecting straightened hair, and taking on Afrocentric names directly originated from the \u201cblack is beautiful\u201d movement, which promoted black self-love. Embracing an African aesthetic during this period required courage, considering that in the recent past black students were discouraged from wearing bright colors, let alone African dress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo is there a right way to pay reverence to the culture while rocking a current trend? Of course. To start, don\u2019t treat it like a trend. But in addition, I like to follow a few basic guidelines:\n\nShop From the Source\n\nDid you know you can buy Ankara-printed dresses on Amazon.com for under $50? Of course, you could also spend several hundreds more, and buy them from English designer and Beatle progeny Stella McCartney, who was taken to task this fall for using African prints (and a noticeable lack of African models) in her Spring 2018 collection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeedless to say, there are better ways to get the look while supporting designers of the African Diaspora: Think less Stella McCartney, more Stella Jean\u2014or Nigerian-born Duro Olowu. I personally love to support African designers by hitting African-owned Etsy and pop-up shops, like the many thrown by online marketplace Zuvaa this past year.\n\nA recent new find at one of these events? Benin-born designer Eldior Sodeck, whose Ankara-patterned silhouettes range from traditional to Afrofuturist, with nods to athleisure and Japanese kimonos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t Mix and Max Out on Metaphors\n\nWith such a wealth of beautiful African goods out there, it\u2019s tempting to pile it all on\u2014but just because you can doesn\u2019t mean you should. You don\u2019t need to make a statement. African fashions are so striking, it\u2019s generally ideal to pick one item or category\u2014a bag or a blouse or an armful of bracelets (not all at once)\u2014and let that speak for itself. Besides, Africa is an entire continent, which means that putting too many elements together can actually be culturally confusing.\n\nCome Culturally Correct\n\nSince Kwanzaa is an African-American holiday, it\u2019s only fair to remind you that there are plenty of African-American designers doing the damn thing\u2014and evoking African styles and silhouettes in the process. Not sure where to start? Check out Demestik by Reuben Reuel or Onion Cut & Sewn by Whitney Mero. Feeling creative? Brooklyn, N.Y.-based home-design brand AphroChic sells its culturally evocative patterns by the yard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKnow Your History\n\nDo you know where the Ankara print originated, and how it evolved? How about the centuries of religious history behind the Coptic cross? Have you ever unraveled the complicated history of head wraps?\n\nThe fact is, there\u2019s a wealth of information out there to inform and support your style choices (ask Google\u2014she knows everything). Just having some basic knowledge can transform trend chasing into a teachable moment. For instance, if you\u2019re still conflicted about appropriation, Nadra Nittle also gifted us with this little bit of historical reference, which is handy for both Kwanzaa and the greater civil conflict in which we still find ourselves:\n\nAmerican blacks saw a parallel between Africa\u2019s struggle for independence and their own struggle for equal rights in the United States. Their interest in African fashion never stemmed from a desire to rip off African peoples and popularize their customs for profit, as is often the case with cultural appropriation. It stemmed from the desire to carve out a new racial identity in a nation that had not only treated them as sub-humans, but also taught them to buy into damaging stereotypes about their ancestral homeland, further instilling in them a sense of inferiority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Liberian-born designer Abios\u00e9 Decont\u00e9e Massaquoi of Fiend List, the feeling is entirely mutual.\n\n\u201cYou know, I came from Liberia when I was young, and I came to America. And as an immigrant, coming from where I came from, I can appreciate what America [has] done for me,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd so, when I advertise my stuff ... I always, I always try to do it in a way where everybody can wear it, and enjoy it; kind of as a way of getting people together.\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s not appreciation, I don\u2019t know what is.", "keywords": ["trend", "kwanzaa", "black", "fashion", "ankhs", "ankara", "right", "know", "rock", "stella", "ongoing", "way", "style", "argument", "wearing", "african", "appropriationvsappreciation", "love"], "polarity": 0.1284000721500721, "subjectivity": 0.39345306024993526},

But should they do everything? I\u2019ve compiled a short list of things that, while white guys feel totally comfortable doing, maybe they should let someone else try or just stop doing altogether.\n\nNeedlessly abbreviate words.\n\nNot too long ago, I was talking to a white colleague about referring someone for a potential job opening and my Caucasian homey said, \u201cYou should definitely consider her. She\u2019s a total natch for the role.\u201d\n\nHuh? The fuck is a \u201cnatch,\u201d bruh and should we be referring to women like that, you know, like in the workplace, like right now and shit?\n\nThen he was like, \u201cNoooo, noooo, man. I mean that she\u2019s a real natural fit for the job.\u201d Which then reminded me that white dudes always find a way to abbreviate words for no fucking reason.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t seen you in a while man, how was the vacay?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re headed to Shake Shack to grab some burgs, dude. You wanna roll?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m having a little soiree at my apt this weekend. Feel free to come through with your LL (see: little lady).\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis shit needs to stop. I\u2019m fluent as shit in slang, but I\u2019m fuck-all in abbreviations.\n\nSuggest places to purchase electronics.\n\nDid you know that white men go to stores where they don\u2019t know anybody that works there and pay full price for electronic items that come in sealed boxes?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrazy, right?\n\nI told one of my white compadres that I was looking for a new TV so he recommended a spot. When I asked him who I need to look for (because, you know, *wink wink*, gonna get that hook-up) he just stared at me. Then I remembered that white dudes make more money than everyone else and he could actually afford the shit I\u2019m breaking my own bank to front to get. Then I called my homie and two days later I picked up my new TV in the parking lot beside a Costco.\n\nOrder shots for the table.\n\nIt always starts the same way. You\u2019re out with your white friends having a few drinks, maybe watching the game, or doing something else alcoholically benign when the server brings over a tray of Jameson shots and then Ryan from Account Services does that dumb ass shrug while saying, \u201cUh oh, looks like it\u2019s a round of Jamo for the crew!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you thought this was just a benevolent gesture of friendship, you thought wrong. As soon as you accept that first shot, you\u2019re agreeing to take a trip down the road to white boy wasted that only ends with you sitting at your desk the next morning wearing Ray Bans indoors, guzzling a Pedialyte, and trying to ignore Ryan when he says, \u201cHey brah, I\u2019m sorry if things got a little crazy last night. I\u2019ll buy you a new phone.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd all you can do is shake your head as you pick glitter out of your beard.\n\n\n\nCarry guns.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not saying that white men are more prone to violence or have some natural inclination to shoot people. What I am saying is that I\u2019m not clear on what the parameters are for getting shot by a white guy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHear me out. When it comes to black people shooting black people, I have a firm understanding of how, why, and when I might get that iron pulled on me:\n\n-Selling dope in the wrong neighborhood.\n\n-Owing the wrong muthafucka some money.\n\n-Snitching.\n\n-Escalated disrespect in a public setting.\n\nAll those can and will get you shot by another black person. But with white guys, they just kinda shoot everyone, sometimes en masse, and usually no one knows why. I think we need to have a moratorium of firearms sales to white men until they can draft a clear memo detailing their shooting protocol (other than the cops just shooting black folks \u2018cause they can) so that people know what parts of town are clear and shit.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite people always want to ask me if my neighborhood is safe to visit at night, I feel like I\u2019m owed the same courtesy.\n\nBe in charge of like, everything.\n\nIt goes without saying that, after about a 600 year or so run, white guys have had a pretty good go of the whole Eurocentric patriarchic power structure thing. And while I\u2019m sure that they\u2019d point to history as precedent as to why white men seem to be in charge of everything, have they ever asked themselves a.) why they seem to be in charge of everything and, b.) should they reasonably be in charge of everything?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the recent release of Michael Wolff\u2019s Fire and Fury and the unflattering portrait it paints of the Trump Administration, I\u2019ve seen conservative (mostly white male) commentators alleging that the stories in the book must be fabrications or exaggerations. And of course, they would. In their minds, they probably see an assembly of seemingly successful white dudes in their rightful seat of power where they (by virtue of their whiteness and maleness) shouldn\u2019t have any problems because they project success onto other white men. Ineptitude or incompetence or plain ol\u2019 stupidity aren\u2019t traits that they\u2019ve been conditioned to see in themselves (those are for the women and the coloreds) so why would they see them in their peers?\n\nThis feeds the broader point. Maybe, just maybe, being a white man isn\u2019t enough. Maybe, the Trump Administration\u2019s flaws are indicative of a larger logical fallacy that we\u2019ve fallen into and perhaps other dominions of white male supremacy are just as fucked up. Banks? Higher education? Corporate America? Perhaps they\u2019re all inhabited by a bunch of mediocre white guys who keep getting the benefit of the doubt because success has been projected upon them by their peers.\n\n\n\nJuxtapose this with Sunday night\u2019s Golden Globes, where the spirit of unanimity and solidarity for inclusion and equality for women and minorities was on display beyond a mere act of sartorial activism. The Time\u2019s Up movement\u2019s presence in conjunction with Oprah Winfrey\u2019s clarion speech extolling viewers to focus on the horizon ahead stand in stark contrast with the #MAGA crowd and their insistence on perpetuating the fantasy of the patriarchal status quo. Or, simply stated, Auntie Oprah speaks for the America that, in spite of itself, could be. Diverse in its leadership, empathetic in its promise, and equitable in the distribution of its justice. Trump and his followers speak for an America that never was and will never be. But success is not zero sum; in order for others to gain, it\u2019s not as if white men have to lose.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs we stand at the fulcrum between Oprah\u2019s optimism and Trump\u2019s Trumpism, we all have to ask ourselves how long we can be denied our own equitable seats at the table for the sake of giving in to an antiquated norm. The evidence shows that, try as they might, we can\u2019t just let the white guys do it all by themselves. Hell, perhaps they created systems of discrimination and oppression because they knew that all along and hoped we\u2019d never find out.\n\n\n\nToo late.", "keywords": ["wrong", "guys", "things", "black", "probably", "know", "white", "stop", "men", "maybe", "saying", "charge", "im", "letting"], "polarity": -0.0051354953897326805, "subjectivity": 0.409657868026512},

Lay Down Our Edges\n\nThis one is pretty un-fuck-with-able. Forget the wardrobe and accessories\u2014what\u2019s sis\u2019 edges looking like? If a toothbrush wasn\u2019t involved in the making of the hairstyle, go back and try again (please don\u2019t try to understand this logic; just go with it). If a proper gel or styling agent cannot be located, be sure to check with the model. Nine times out of 10, she knew y\u2019all would get it wrong and likely has all necessary styling equipment in her bag, and/or has a homegirl around the corner who can be there in 15 minutes.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Racism Cannot Be Cured With a Kardashian\n\nI\u2019m sure the bronzer, large number of black men, enlarged lips, cornrows and build-a-booties would lead you to believe otherwise, but trust me on this one.\n\n\n\n3. All Models of Color Must Maintain Their Melanin Throughout the Making of the Advertisement\n\nIt\u2019s never a good look if a model or actor has to set aside his or her blackness for the sake of selling a product. FYI, I wasn\u2019t speaking figuratively; I said what I said. If your model must remove, lighten or disrobe their skin, you\u2019re probably going down the wrong creative path. Yes, Michael Jackson made it work for the \u201cBlack or White\u201d video, but you ain\u2019t Michael, and you dang sure ain\u2019t Tyra Banks killing \u2019em with your shoulders alongside the King of Pop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Don\u2019t Exclude Us\n\nI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re selling pumpkin-spice lattes with a side of cottage cheese out of the back of a Volkswagen Beetle at a Taylor Swift concert; somewhere, somehow, there\u2019s a black person who may be into it. In many ways, we\u2019re just like you, so don\u2019t leave us out. The last thing you want us to do is play a round of \u201cFind the Negro\u201d on your ad. It won\u2019t end well.\n\n5. Along Those Same Lines, Don\u2019t Assume We\u2019re Monolithic\n\nSo, you know how some white people like the color blue, while others prefer purple or yellow or orange? Well, it\u2019s exactly the same with black people. What works for some of us may not work for others (case in point: the age-old debate of grits vs. Cream of Wheat). One size does not fit all, and one marketing tactic does not work for the masses\u2014unless, of course, you\u2019re Beyonc\u00e9, for every living being shall get into formation accordingly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Don\u2019t Try to Be Us\n\nWhen marketing to or for a black person, it\u2019s always preferred that you use an actual black person. Aesthetically, it\u2019s a lot more pleasing.\n\n7. We Give No Cares About Your Apology\n\nThe damage is done. The racism has been distributed widely across multiple platforms and we screenshot the hell out of it, so who cares what you have to say after the fact? I\u2019m sure most brands don\u2019t intentionally sit down and say, \u201cHow can we eff with the most historically disenfranchised and oppressed group of people of all time?\u201d But unfortunately that doesn\u2019t matter.

(insert next city here). Very few have called it a terrorism-related incident.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, a terrorist activity is defined, in part, as:\n\nThe use of any\u2014 (a) biological agent, chemical agent, or nuclear weapon or device, or (b) explosive, firearm, or other weapon or dangerous device (other than for mere personal monetary gain), with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same legal explanation (pdf) defines a terrorist organization as \u201ca group of two or more individuals, whether organized or not, which engages in, or has a subgroup which engages in, the activities described.\u201d\n\nThe latest tragedy is directly related to our government\u2019s unwillingness to create and enforce commonsense gun laws, fueled by a criminal cabal that bribes lawmakers with barrels of cash and knowingly promotes and participates in a plot that results in the deaths of seven children every day.\n\nThe National Rifle Association kills people.\n\nThe advocates for the NRA will tell you that its only intent is to protect our Second Amendment right to own firearms. Whether or not you agree with the conservative translation of the Second Amendment, there is no doubt that the NRA\u2019s belief that every American has an unassailable right to own a gun has morphed into a semireligious philosophy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s unrelenting fight against commonsense gun regulation is based on that philosophy in the same way that Nazis want to rid the world of nonwhites, and religious extremists believe that people who don\u2019t adhere to their theological philosophy should perish from the earth.\n\nIn America, it should never be illegal to believe in these things. But when these individuals form groups that engage in activities that \u201cendanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals\u201d\u2014whether it is flying a plane into a New York City building or driving a car through anti-racism protesters at a Charlottesville, Va. rally\u2014it rises to the legal definition of terrorism.\n\nThe NRA is a terrorist organization.\n\nOn Oct. 16, 2017, the city of Newark, N.J., announced a federal lawsuit against 10 drug companies that manufacture prescription opioids. In December, five suburban Illinois counties followed suit. By January, New York City, the largest city in America, did the same.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of these lawsuits argue that the pharmaceutical companies involved have sold defective products. Instead, they allege that the corporations that sell and market these drugs to consumers have knowingly engaged in practices that allow an otherwise legal product to end up in the wrong hands, resulting in an epidemic of addiction and death for which the public has paid the price. Therefore, the suits allege, the companies are\u2014at the very least\u2014partially responsible.\n\nThis has worked before. The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement forced tobacco manufacturers to pay $206 billion for tobacco-related deaths and illnesses. The companies also had to stop targeting youths, restrict advertising, and enact policies so that cigarettes and tobacco products wouldn\u2019t end up in the hands of children. The case revealed that Big Tobacco had covered up the dangers of its products for years by uniting to lobby lawmakers with billions of dollars and obscuring data about its poisonous product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds a lot like the gun industry.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people died from gun deaths in 2016 (38,658) than from prescription opioids (around 14,400). And 13,686 of the people killed by guns that year were under the age of 19. Even if you believe in the premise of self-protection or \u201chaters gonna hate, thugs gonna thug,\u201d when you extract the criminal element from total gun deaths, 495 of those deaths were unintentional, and another 22,938 were suicides.\n\nThe grand total of U.S. deaths from terrorism and extremist activities over the last decade is 71.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, if you added up the numbers of every American casualty of terrorism since 1865, the numbers of gun deaths in 2016 alone would dwarf it.\n\nThere is no doubt that guns are a worse problem than terrorism in America. The ease of acquiring firearms causes thousands of needless deaths in the U.S. It is a fact that states with large-capacity-magazine bans have fewer firearm-related deaths. In our examination of mass-shooting deaths, The Root found that 253 people were killed by semi-automatic assault-style weapons since 1966.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though polls show that 90 percent of Americans have no problem with mandated background checks as a prerequisite to purchasing a gun, the NRA opposes it. According to Gallup, 8 in 10 Americans favor legislation banning assault-style weapons, but the NRA fights against it. Eighty-two percent of those polled favor outlawing attachments that allow guns to fire rapidly, but the NRA lobbies against the effort.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s crusade against gun reform has nothing to do with the will of the people. It is an ideological war that kills and injures thousands of innocent people every year. It is based on a fundamentalist interpretation of the Second Amendment not shared by the American people.\n\nIt is terrorism.\n\nIn the same way that most Muslims don\u2019t support al-Qaida or the Islamic State group, and the majority of white people don\u2019t support the neo-Nazi movement or the Ku Klux Klan, most people who own firearms don\u2019t support the National Rifle Association. The NRA is not some loose confederation of well-intentioned gun owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the organization claims to have 5 million members (a figure that many are skeptical of), that seemingly large number accounts for only 1.5 percent of the U.S. population and less than 7 percent of gun owners. That means that 98.8 percent of the country, and 93 percent of the people who legally own firearms, want nothing to do with the NRA.\n\n\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org, the NRA spent an average of $3 million on lobbying in each of the past five years. This money does not come from members of the NRA\u2014it comes from gun manufacturers who give tens of million of dollars to the organization through a variety of means, including donations, sponsorship programs, advertising and revenue sharing. Taurus automatically purchases an NRA membership for every customer who buys one of its guns. Sturm, Ruger gives $1 from every purchase to the NRA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ...with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals ... \u201d\n\nThe gun debate has never been about the Second Amendment. Most politicians, lawyers and legal experts agree that the right to bear arms will never be revoked. The real question is about America\u2019s unwillingness to regulate the gun industry and the NRA\u2019s ability to escape the same scrutiny as entities in similarly dangerous fields of commerce.\n\n\n\nAttorney Leslie Thompson, who works with companies on the legal protection of consumer products, told The Root: \u201cThe NRA and gun manufacturers have one advantage that the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries don\u2019t have: the Second Amendment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the ability to exercise a constitutional right can be regulated,\u201d Thompson explained, noting that age and ID requirements are required to vote. \u201cEven the right to freedom of speech is subject to slander and libel laws to prevent fellow citizens from being recklessly injured.\u201d\n\nAlthough lawmakers, careless gun owners and retail outlets are not faultless in the scourge of firearm-related deaths that plague this country, the uniquely American epidemic of murders, mass shootings, accidents and suicides points back to this singular organization that has prioritized its fundamentalist ideology over the pain and suffering of the citizens of this country.\n\n\n\nThe NRA\u2019s complicity in thousands of deaths every year is directly related to the amount of money it funnels from gun manufacturers to lawmakers. If the public found out that another organization with the body count of the NRA was lobbying politicians and writing laws, there would be a national scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Rifle Association should not be exempt. It is more powerful and scarier than al-Qaida and the \u201calt-right\u201d combined. The trite aphorism used most often by the organization that has become a willful accessory to thousands of American murders explains it best:\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people ...\n\nThe NRA does.", "keywords": ["nra", "legal", "directly", "right", "gun", "second", "organization", "nras", "dont", "deaths", "terrorist"], "polarity": 0.06106391924573743, "subjectivity": 0.4029339852067124},

Like, I\u2019m sure we all could go on and on about how terrible this year truly was to each and every last one of us. Still, the year had some high points, which we pointed out earlier this week, but in the spirit of balance and equilibrium (it took me all that I had to not make a Star Wars crack, since I finally went to go see The Last Jedi), I think reflection on the super, terrible year that was 2017 is necessary, even if that means reflecting on its low points for us as a people.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nSo, without further ado, I present to you the top 10 disappointing moments (in no particular order) black people experienced in the year 2017:\n\n\n\n1. White People\n\nThis ... is a given. In 2017, perhaps the greatest moments of discomfort, borderline instability and downright asininity experienced by our large and expansive community could be most certainly traced back to Chet and them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom President Cheeto Dandruff yucking it up in the White House and threatening to start a war every time he tweeted with his sausage fingers to white people trying to install a whole (alleged) child molester in another political office in Alabama to chanting about \u201cwhite lives\u201d in Charlottesville, Va., with their busted tiki torches, white folx showed no sign of waking the fuck up and instead continued to plead that we save them from themselves.\n\n2. The Atlanta Falcons Giving Up a 25-Point Lead in the Super Bowl\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Jan. 22, 2017, it was announced that the Atlanta Falcons would face off against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl 51. And after President Radioactive Cheeto Dust was elected to office at the conclusion of 2016, it became quite clear that this aforementioned game was about to become an unintentional, extended metaphor for that year.\n\nIndeed, it was the ultrablack, ultralit Falcons versus Trump\u2019s America the New England Patriots and Tom \u201cTrump Is My Boi\u201d Brady. And for a minute, during that very game, it looked as if the Falcons were gonna take the win, with a 25-point lead to boot.\n\n... and then they blew that lead to lose to Trump\u2019s America the Patriots by six points.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was one of the most embarrassing Ls we took this year, and to be quite honest, I\u2019ll never get over it.\n\n3. The Cancellation of Underground\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am honestly still too angry to describe how unjust it was that Underground was canceled but shows like, oh, I don\u2019t know, Megyn Kelly Today are still chilling on the air.\n\nIt was an unnecessary loss of a show that focused on aspects of black liberation during slavery rather than the kind of torture porn that Hollywood is used to peddling. The cancellation was especially hard to swallow when it was announced that HBO had its own alternate-universe slavery fan fiction in development (thankfully, that looks like it\u2019s no longer happening).\n\nHowever, despite its unjust cancellation, the search for a new home network for Underground continues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Alexandra Shipp, Tinashe and Colorism\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColorism. It is a subset of oppression that precedes your existence and mine. And yet, to this day, black people can\u2019t seem to get ourselves together when it comes to this topic. Such was the case this year as well.\n\nTinashe was the earliest example as she implied that being light-skinned had hurt her odds of succeeding in the music industry, even though she had not done anything remarkable as of late, and she simultaneously failed to call out the over-saturation of stars who look like her in the business, thereby causing her lamentations to fall on deaf ears.\n\nAlexandra Shipp was just another example of this when, a couple of weeks ago, the actress claimed that black people had been the most racist to her for her entire life. This was after a Storm superfan came into her Twitter mentions about hoping that Marvel would cast a dark-skinned Storm for a hypothetical X-Men franchise reboot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot everyone agreed with how the fan approached the ever present problem of characters like Storm being portrayed by light-skinned actresses, but I think most of us can agree that the actress (a word I use lightly) took the conversation in a direction that didn\u2019t even make any damn sense.\n\nAnd in 2017, we should be able to do better.\n\n5. Russell Simmons Proved How Tight Sexual Predators Can Be\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2017 was a shit year, no doubt, but it also proved to be, for the most part, a year of reckoning for men who had done some dirt in the dark. The domino effect started with Harvey Weinstein, and folks are still out here in these streets being rightfully exposed. And Russell Simmons was among those in the carnage.\n\nAfter Terry Crews came forward about being sexually assaulted by WME\u2019s Adam Venit (a moment that was very, very important for male survivors), Crews also was very candid about the folx who had tried to silence him and, in turn, exposed Simmons\u2019 damning email to Crews in which he attempted to tell Crews to \u201clet it go.\u201d It was a disgusting development, and no one was surprised when Simmons was subsequently accused of sexual assault, too. However, folx who were familiar with Simmons\u2019 Rush Card scams and Kimora Lee\u2019s stories about him knew that this was part of an already trifling pattern of behavior.\n\n6. The Fallout from VerySmartBrothas\u2019 \u201cStraight Black Men Are the White People of Black People\u201d Piece\n\nThe moment I saw the headline \u201cStraight Black Men Are the White People of Black People\u201d come across my timeline, I knew that all hell was about to break loose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nI\u2019m not gonna get into the specifics of the piece (mostly because you can read it here), but Damon Young\u2019s article got at a point that cisgender straight men had been ignoring for a long time: that they are the most privileged in our community.\n\nOf course, it wasn\u2019t as easy to refute coming from a fellow cis, straight black man, so many of Young\u2019s detractors, in turn, went after prominent black women who had shared the article\u2014the chief example being Jemele Hill, who they had all fake supported weeks prior. It was an ever present example of the kind of hypocritical bullshit black women are confronted with every damn day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Time: The Kalief Browder Story Reminds Us of Everyone We\u2019ve Lost to an Unjust Justice System\n\nOn Oct. 6, 2016, it was announced that Jay-Z and his team were putting together a documentary about the life, times, and completely unnecessary and avoidable death of Kalief Browder. The documentary finally debuted this year, and while it was something we sorely needed, it was also a painful reminder of all the black people we had lost thus far to an unjust \u201cjustice system.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt also served as a harrowing admonisher of the effects that racism and white supremacy can have on our bodies and minds, too, which we were reminded of after his mother\u2019s (Venida Browder) untimely death last year and Erica Garner\u2019s recent hospitalization.\n\n8. Black Transgender Model Munroe Bergdorf Called Out Racism and Was Fired by L\u2019Oreal\n\nIn a year full of watershed moments when women snatched back the mic from a society that constantly seeks to silence us, it was particularly angering when Munroe Bergdorf did just that and was punished for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, L\u2019Oreal was all for profiting off her image as a black trans woman and her ties to those respective communities, but as soon as she attempted to speak on behalf of them, L\u2019Oreal was like, \u201cNah.\u201d Combine this with instances like Jemele Hill\u2019s, and it\u2019s another example of these corporations wanting \u201cdiversity\u201d without teeth. Performative nonsense.\n\n9. That Racist Dove Commercial\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s be real. Since the goal of any sensible corporation or business is to make a boatload of cold, hard, stinking cash (hello, capitalism), no one is expecting them to be super-\u201cwoke,\u201d empathetic entities.\n\nHowever.\n\nIn the spirit of getting as much money as fucking possible, you would think they could at least appeal to the most common denominator of their demographics and have people on deck to make sure they are not racially insulting a huge chunk of their base.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019d think.\n\nBut this year, that was not the case with Dove. Dove made it excruciatingly obvious that it has no black people in its public relations/marketing department when it released a commercial that showed a dark-skinned black woman taking off a brown shirt and morphing into a white woman.\n\nTo be forthcoming, it wasn\u2019t the only beauty company with a racist ad this year. Nivea joined in on the fun by putting out its \u201cWhite Is Purity\u201d ad and got the social media flogging it deserved. Yet Dove\u2019s ad happened to be a bit more biting because black people are a huge piece of its base and because there\u2019s something very visceral about seeing a black woman morphing into a white woman in an ad that is not Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cBlack or White\u201d video\u2014especially considering the history of racist soap advertisements in America and abroad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. Dave Chappelle\u2019s Return\n\n\n\nIn March 2017, after years of being off the air and mostly out of the limelight, Dave Chappelle prepared for what looked to be a roaringly victorious return to television.\n\nThis was something black folx had been anticipating and cheering on for a long time. After watching Chappelle walk away from a $50 million contract and refuse to be Comedy Central\u2019s dancing monkey (and thereby get branded \u201cunstable\u201d because of it), we were all excited for him to stick it to the man and make a glorious comeback via Netflix.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd he surely did return, but it wasn\u2019t the unanimous victory some of us were hoping for.\n\n\n\nWith his Netflix specials, it was clear that Chappelle had not lost his sharp comedic edge and that he was still 100 percent on point about the subtleties and not-so-subtleties of white supremacy and how its food chain works (e.g., \u201cWhite women not liking their cut\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it was also very clear that Chappelle may not have completely crossed over into 2017 with the rest of us.

So imagine our surprise that one of the most melanin-rich presentations of the season almost escaped our notice: Maki Oh, by Nigerian designer Amaka Osakwe.\n\n\n\nBased in Lagos, Osakwe has been at the helm of her own label since 2010, and since that time she has become one of the few Nigerian designers to have a global reach. Her designs have been worn by Beyonc\u00e9, Kerry Washington and our forever first lady, Michelle Obama.\n\nThis season, Osakwe sent her models down the runway in a range of muted hues and quirky but sophisticated silhouettes and pattern combinations that seemed to evoke a type of nomadic chic. These immensely wearable clothes are for a woman who is not only worldly but also winsome, featuring wonderfully cut trousers, satiny sliplike pieces under suiting fabrics, and lam\u00e9 coats that I\u2019m literally swooning over. (Seriously. Gimme.)\n\nBut what was perhaps most beautiful about Maki Oh\u2019s presentation was that her models were all women of color, in all shades of color, seeming to represent the entirety of the African Diaspora itself\u2014with their natural hair textures, no less!\n\nIt was a refreshing, almost matter-of-fact occurrence, and consistent with Osakwe\u2019s castings over her last few seasons. But during a week when black representation has long been a struggle, it felt like a definite boost for the home team.

But where Sebastian Silva\u2019s Sundance flick differs from Jordan Peele\u2019s Oscar-nominated movie is that Tyrel exists without hypnosis or the sunken place.\n\n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t pack the overt racial punch in the gut that Get Out had, but Tyrel provides a nuanced exploration of human behavior and cultural differences that is delivered with a harrowing sense of reality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJason Mitchell (The Chi, Mudbound, Straight Outta Compton) stars as Tyler, who is in need of a break from the hustle and bustle of New York City after his girlfriend\u2019s family takes over their apartment. His friend Johnny (Christopher Abbott) suggests that he hang out with him and his buddies in their Catskills, N.Y., cabin to celebrate the birthday of Pete (Caleb Landry Jones). What appears to be an all-male affair where the bros can indulge in alcohol and conversation slowly devolves into something that Tyler isn\u2019t familiar with. And from unfamiliarity emerges an uncomfortable environment and, eventually, paranoia.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the film\u2019s title of Tyrel, while the protagonist\u2019s name is Tyler, is no mistake and is indicative of the cultural misunderstandings that abound.\n\nDuring their first drunken night at the cabin, Tyler is swiftly sobered up by the collective raucous behavior, with Pete being the most grating and unnerving of the varied personalities. This phase of microaggression isn\u2019t anything new for the group. But for Tyler, it\u2019s foreign territory that doesn\u2019t sit well with him. Rather than endear himself to the group, Tyler instead warms up to Cosmo, the family dog, and hides away from the crew behind his bond with the canine. Eventually, Tyler feigns fatigue and retreats to bed, but Johnny notices that his friend is acting oddly and calls him out for being a party pooper the following morning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThings don\u2019t get any easier when Alan (a charismatic Michael Cera) arrives to crank up the abrasive behavior another notch. Tyler tries to lose himself in seemingly endless gulps of Irish coffee, but it only heightens his paranoia and uneasiness. While the group of buddies welcome Alan\u2019s behavior, it\u2019s simply too unnerving for Tyler. Silly games that ask Tyler to use a \u201cblack accent,\u201d or when the group mocks religion, pull back the curtain on some racial prejudices that exist within the group. Perhaps none is more damning than when one of the partygoers mistakingly calls the protagonist \u201cTyrel.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard for Tyler to decide if his discomfort is racial, cultural or just a simple case of struggling to be social. But, ultimately, he realizes that this just isn\u2019t a crowd he can relate to, and it results in his making some irrational decisions as the weekend drags on.\n\nWhile Silva\u2019s film handles this situation very naturally, it lacks the punch of Get Out and opts to stew in its own despondence throughout the 86-minute runtime. It occasionally drags without anything of consequence taking place as the group\u2019s antics swallow up a majority of the screen time. And we don\u2019t really learn much about the partygoers or why they are the way they are, which forces them into one-dimensional characters. You have the gay guy, the eccentric guy, the hard-nosed guy, etc. Names don\u2019t really matter when you can identify them by their actions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat truly anchors the film is Mitchell\u2019s performance. He masterfully puts together a character who is a passive and well-intentioned presence and tries his best not to ruin the fun with the uneasiness he feels toward the group. But as the film carries on, their shenanigans wear him down and cause him to question whether or not these actions are designed to unnerve him or if he\u2019s just a little too paranoid about his surroundings. What Mitchell also does extraordinarily well is portray a man who unintentionally uses liquor as a truth serum of sorts. The more alcohol he consumes, the more comfortable he is with calling out their antics. His intoxication is believable as Mitchell handles the inner turmoil of Tyler with exceptional nuance.\n\nIt all leads to a final act where everything comes to a head and leads Tyler to come to grips with his surroundings. The story doesn\u2019t end neatly and seems to take a lot longer to get to the resolution than it actually does. However, it manages to be a tense, and not necessarily amusing, experience that will be digested differently depending on the viewing audience.", "keywords": ["tyler", "guy", "place", "isnt", "group", "behavior", "film", "tyrel", "sunken", "racial", "sundances", "mitchell", "dont", "hypnosis"], "polarity": 0.09661118763391491, "subjectivity": 0.45882220473129554},

Originally based on supermodels Naomi Campbell and Tyra Banks, the Dora were initially conceived not only as female warriors but also as potential wives for the king, whom they\u2019ve pledged to protect, along with the royal family. They were the best and strongest women from the 18 villages within Wakanda and trained at the royal palace.\n\nBut while Priest may in part cite supermodels as his inspiration, there is a historical prototype for the Dora Milaje in the Dahomey \u201cAmazons\u201d\u2014so nicknamed by European colonizers and now known by the French-speaking Beninese as the \u201cN\u2019Nonmiton\u201d (which translates to \u201cour mothers\u201d in Fon).\n\nCreated in the late 17th century by King Wegbaja of the West African nation of Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) as a group of female hunters known as gbeto, and later expanded by his son King Agaja, the N\u2019Nonmiton were an all-female guard and fighting force. Like the Dora Milaje, the N\u2019Nonmiton were also considered wives of the king, pledging celibacy as well as loyalty and protection to him. And they existed in this role until the colonization of Dahomey in the late 19th century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can learn all about the incredible female warriors of Dahomey in a 2015 episode of the podcast Stuff You Missed in History Class, and in a very comprehensive comic on their history created by UNESCO for its Series on Women in African History (pdf).

Yet the deification of guns, based on the unassailable doctrine of the Second Amendment, has evolved from a political right into our state-sanctioned religion.\n\nThese horrific tragedies couldn\u2019t convince the congregation of the National-Rifle-Association-Church-of-Christ to move an inch closer to commonsense gun control. The die-hard believers will resist any step toward gun regulations, with counterarguments based on flawed logic, devoid of facts. So we decided to examine them one by one with an objective eye.\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people. People kill people.\n\nWhile this is true, an overwhelming number of people who kill people use guns. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s statistics show that 69 percent of the homicides in 2014 were from gun deaths. The rate is steadily rising. While it is true that people are causing a rise in violent crime for the second year in a row, that they are using guns to commit these crimes is an unavoidable fact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nABC News Your trusted source for breaking news, analysis, exclusive interviews, headlines, and videos at\u2026 Read more Read\n\nThe number of mass shootings, injuries and even unintentional shootings has risen every year since 2014, according to the nonpartisan Gun Violence Archive. There is only one common thread in all of these statistics: guns.\n\nUntil we hear about an outbreak of mass spooning incidents or the growing number of drive-by knifings, let\u2019s acknowledge that people kill people ... with guns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlmost always with guns.\n\nThe Second Amendment guarantees us the right to our guns.\n\nFor the sake of argument, let\u2019s take the Second Amendment and apply its literal, fundamentalist meaning to where it states this: \u201cA well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere isn\u2019t a single mainstream politician holding office in the House or Senate who has put forth a proposal to repeal the Second Amendment. So we can eliminate that argument there. Full stop.\n\nHaving said that, every other argument is based on how we regulate Americans\u2019 right to bear arms as we do every other freedom.\n\nWe all enjoy the right to free speech, but there are libel, perjury and slander laws that limit what we can say when it might injure others. We are guaranteed the freedom of assembly, but we must apply for parade or protest permits or risk being arrested for obstructing traffic and impeding the rights of others. Our rights to vote, privacy and even sex are all regulated by certain caveats. You must be 18 to cast a ballot. Police can search your underwear drawer with a warrant, and you can\u2019t just grab a woman\u2019s private parts without her consent. (Unless you\u2019re running for president or an Alabama Senate seat.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201cslippery slope.\u201d\n\nThis might be the stupidest argument ever. The National Rifle Association would have you believe that once we allow the government to register weapons, limit the size of gun magazines or enact background checks, jackbooted thugs will kick down our doors and confiscate our firearms.\n\nThat\u2019s not how this works. That\u2019s not how any of this works.\n\nYou know why jackbooted thugs will never kick in your door and take your guns (aside from the fact that no one has ever told me where I can get a pair of those door-kicking jackboots)? Because lawmakers have already limited the kinds of weapons a person can own. You can\u2019t buy an anti-aircraft gun or a Pershing tank. The government will always have bigger weapons than yours.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlus, I\u2019m still waiting for Barack Obama to come take my guns. I\u2019ve always wanted to meet him.\n\nIf guns are against the law, then only criminals will have guns.\n\nIt is true that 34 percent of mass shooters were prohibited from owning weapons. But that also means 66 percent of mass shooters used legal firearms. What if laws simply reduced the numbers by one or two mass shootings per year?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFact: States with magazine-capacity restrictions experience fewer mass shootings, according to CNN.\n\nFact: States that require background checks on all firearm sales have lower gun-related deaths per capita than states that don\u2019t, according to data from the CDC, the NRA and the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFact: A correct, thorough background check would have prevented Dylann Roof from legally purchasing the guns he used in the Charleston, S.C., church shooting. A national ban on assault weapons would have prevented Devin Patrick Kelley from purchasing the Ruger AR-556 that he purchased legally from Academy Sports & Outdoors in San Antonio, Texas.\n\nIn fact, when we analyzed the Washington Post\u2019s list of U.S. mass shootings since 1966, semi-automatic, assault-style weapons were used in incidents that resulted in 253 deaths.\n\nHow about the small number of crimes that would be prevented if people were turned away because of mental-health issues? What about the number of potential killers who would change their minds during a three-day waiting period? What about the number of lives that would be saved by smaller-capacity magazines?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBased on the logic of \u201cCriminals don\u2019t care about gun laws,\u201d why make any law?

According to them, even with its strict gun laws, Chicago is a big, bad bogey monster filled with murderous thugs who will gun you down at any time. It is the most dangerous city in America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept that it\u2019s not.\n\nUsing the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting data, Chicago ranks 25th in murders per capita, far behind cities like Jackson, Miss.; Savannah, Ga.; and Kansas City, Kan. In fact, when you look at PoliticIt\u2019s ranking of states with the toughest gun laws, of the 24 cities with higher murder rates than Chicago\u2019s, 15 of them are in states with gun laws laxer than Illinois\u2019. Chicago\u2019s population dwarfs most of the other cities, which is why we hear more often about the large numbers of deaths in the Windy City.\n\nBut according to the numbers, Chicago ain\u2019t got shit on Birmingham, Ala.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\n\nGun advocates live under the delusion that they are all John Wayne waiting for a bad guy to ride into town. The truth is, a good guy with a gun never stops a bad guy with a gun. Even though the Sutherland Springs, Texas, shooting allows them to cling to that myth, facts say otherwise.\n\nA 2015 study of FBI and national crime by the Violence Policy Center (pdf) concluded that people are more likely to cause an accidental death than prevent a crime when pulling a gun in self-defense. The Washington Post reports that for every justifiable homicide using a gun, there are 34 criminal suicides, 78 gun suicides and two accidental deaths.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, it is true that an FBI report on active shooters between 2000 and 2013 (pdf) shows that 3 percent of those incidents were stopped by a civilian with a gun ...\n\n... but the same report shows that 13 percent of those events were halted by unarmed citizens.\n\nYou know what else stops bad guys with guns? Fewer guns for bad guys. Making it more difficult for bad guys to acquire guns.

After an early childhood of correcting anyone who dared mispronounce it, I spent most of grammar school feeling burdened by a name seemingly so difficult, no one could be bothered to learn to say it right. By the time I reached junior high, I just wanted to fit in with a cute nickname. The clique of \u201cmean girls\u201d who conditionally befriended me at that age were happy to oblige, suggesting I call myself \u201cMisha\u201d because it was \u201ceasier.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey were right. Misha was easier than Maiysha. She was less ethnic, less complicated, less ... unique in the upscale Chicago suburb where I attended school. And it stuck; all through high school in the suburbs of Minneapolis and my elite liberal arts college years in New York, I was Misha.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until after college, while on a date with a brother who asked me point-blank why I hated the name my father had so lovingly chosen from the back of a Miles Davis album, that I began to ask myself. Very soon after, Maiysha took her rightful place in every introduction.\n\nOne of our undisputed #faves, Danai Gurira, had a similar experience in coming to accept\u2014and embrace\u2014her Zimbabwean name. The actress and writer\u2014who\u2019s rocking worlds this week as Dora Milaje general Okoye in Black Panther (and celebrated her 40th birthday on Valentine\u2019s Day)\u2014penned an intimate essay for Glamour magazine\u2019s February issue. In it, she talks about accepting her African name, which she confesses not even knowing she had until she was 5 years old:\n\nBorn in Grinnell, Iowa, to Zimbabwean academic parents, I was given a nickname, Dede, that stuck before I was cognizant enough to have a choice in the matter. Danai was on the register, certificates, trophies. Dede prevailed still. My own endorsement made it so. It sounded close enough to a Western name and made me feel like I fit in, to some extent at least. We were one of only two black families in town, and Mom and Dad already talked differently from everyone else. A strong African name? Too much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite having African-American parents, I knew that feeling all too well. And like me, Gurira had a \u201ccome to the culture\u201d moment that inspired a major shift in how she self-identified. She shares that transition with Glamour:\n\nI started reading Toni Morrison, Alex Haley, James Baldwin, speeches by Martin Luther King Jr., The Autobiography of Malcolm X. I started to connect the dots around why I was rejecting my people\u2019s cultural markers and the dominating effects of Eurocentric culture. I questioned why I didn\u2019t speak my parents\u2019 native language and began to test how much Shona I knew. I can\u2019t say exactly when it happened, but thank God that it did: I saw that rejecting my own culture, down to the name my parents had given me, was unacceptable. All of a sudden I needed to lay claim to what folks had fought and died for me to have\u2014the freedom to speak my own language, my own name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat freedom led Gurira to begin to refer to herself as \u201cZimerican,\u201d acknowledging her Zimbabwean and American identities as equal and inextricable from each other. It also led her to truly embrace both the beauty and troubled histories of her home countries, which, she writes, currently \u201csit at defining moments: America faces political division and a crisis of leadership, and Zimbabwe is finding its footing in a transition of power after decades under one man\u2019s rule.\u201d Owning that history was empowering for Gurira, who writes:\n\nI realized my heritage was to be celebrated, not denied. I didn\u2019t want to fit into what I perceived as a more Western, more acceptable mainstream. My middle name, Jekesai, means to \u201cilluminate,\u201d taken from a hymn about praying for a light at the end of a dark tunnel. I was born amid the war for independence in Zimbabwe, and my parents didn\u2019t know whether they\u2019d ever be able to go back. Jekesai was a declaration of their hopes that light would come. I wanted to bring light to those who should be seen more, heard more: people of marginalized cultures.\n\nIlluminating, indeed. In Shona, her parents\u2019 native tongue, Danai means \u201cto be in love\u201d or \u201cto love one another.\u201d The name is perfect for a Valentine\u2019s Day baby, but even more so for a woman who now consciously infuses her identity into everything she creates and chooses to participate in.\n\nI began to ask people to call me Danai. That choice has affected every choice I\u2019ve made since\u2014the stories I tell, the characters I play, the activism I embark upon. It has influenced everything from plays I write (including Eclipsed, about a girl thrown into a rebel war camp in Liberia) to portraying a general of an African king\u2019s army in Black Panther to co-founding the nonprofit Almasi Arts, a Zimbabwean American dramatic arts collaborative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust when we thought we couldn\u2019t love her more, Danai Gurira keeps stunning us with her beauty, her strength and, now, her transparency.

This was the concern shared by Voices in Entertainment, a grassroots group initiated by female music execs concerned that the movement wasn\u2019t effectively reaching the music industry.

An email encouraging Grammy Awards attendees to wear white roses, in what would hopefully become the music industry\u2019s version of the #TimesUp blackout on the Golden Globes red carpet.\n\nBut while there were many white roses and #TimesUp pins among the designer finery on the Grammys red carpet, the most powerful moment of the night would be onstage.

It was \u2018this is the creator of this masterwork we have been studying.\u2019 I mean, they totally got that.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOne student ran out of the classroom, sobbing!\u201d\n\nIn a similar way, Get Out\u2019s impact has rippled all over the world in the months since its release. \u201cThere are conversations that are happening now in 2018 concerning race that have never been happening in the history of this country, thanks to Get Out,\u201d Barnes observed. \u201cThere is an opening for artists right now. If you\u2019re willing to speak a dangerous truth, and you\u2019ve got the skill to do it right, there is real opportunity.\u201d\n\nPart of why Get Out resonates so much is because it gets at what\u2019s been called America\u2019s birth defect, which is to say the slave trade and its legacies. \u201cPolitics are the way you actualize or mobilize philosophy. You know, the question\u2014the core questions of philosophy are, \u2018Who am I?\u2019, \u2018What is true?\u2019, and \u2018What is the basic nature of mankind?\u2019\u201d Barnes offers. \u201cAnd in race in America, the basic question was, \u2018Who are we? What are we?\u2019 In other words, does nature trump nurture? Does essence precede existence?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSlavery was based upon the assumption of inferiority,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe emancipation did not say black people were equal. The emancipation said we should not treat these poor people this badly. We\u2019re still dealing with that question of inferiority. I think that up until 1970, and the Voting Rights Act, we were not even full citizens in America. That was when the conversation really began to turn towards, \u2018Are we actually equal? What are the implications of that?\u2019 and, \u2018How much guilt do we need to feel as a nation about the way they\u2019ve been treated if they\u2019re actually equal?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Get Out does,\u201d Due said, \u201cis allegorically document white supremacy and its effects on black Americans. It\u2019s from slavery\u2014metaphorically, you can look at that\u2014Jordan Peele talked about the sunken place about being an interpretation of mass incarceration. But I think you can also extrapolate slavery. The theft of black bodies for labor. In this case, it was the theft of black bodies just to enhance their lives.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that though Due is still teaching it, the online version of the course is not affiliated with UCLA\u2014and there are no exams or graded essays, either. \u201cThere is homework that we will expect students to keep up with,\u201d she says, \u201cbut why take the class if you\u2019re not going to do the homework, right?\u201d Homework largely consists of watching a roster of films. \u201cInstead of one film a week, like I had my UCLA students do, online they\u2019ll be doing more like two films a week,\u201d she notes. The reading portion is mostly made up of short stories. \u201cIt\u2019s an overview course, where the lynchpin is Get Out. Because Get Out\u2014not only because of its success\u2014gives us a common point of conversation, and encompasses to much of what I call the black horror aesthetic. Which is using that allegory as a way of processing everything from slavery, to white supremacy and whatever racialized trauma.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI talked to Due and Barnes weeks ago, after Get Out got shut out at the 2018 Golden Globes, and asked them I asked them what they thought the prospects of an Oscar nomination were. They were optimistic and they also ended up being right:\n\nTananarive Due: I really believe very strongly that Get Out will get, not one, but at least a couple Oscar nominations. I would be shocked if it doesn\u2019t get a Best Original Screenplay. Steven Barnes: I would say that that\u2019s pretty close to a lock. Due: And aside from that, there\u2019s talk of Best Picture. There\u2019s talk of Daniel Kaluuya as Best Lead Actor. So there may be some other nominations. I don\u2019t know how to explain exactly what happened at the Golden Globes. First of all, let me preface it this way \u2014 I don\u2019t know how significant the Golden Globes are as a forecast of the Oscars. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s helpful. And I know it probably can\u2019t hurt. But the voting base is so different. I mean \u2014 can you really think its more important when you look at Writers Guild Awards, and stuff like that.\n\n\u2018But having said that, I\u2019m sure everyone would have loved it if the film had won, or if Daniel Kaluuya had won. Um... it\u2019s tough. Their categorization process is awkward? So that might be some of it. I saw a lot of people obviously will assume it\u2019s sort of a racial shut out, because people don\u2019t want to look at the things that Get Out put out in people\u2019s faces. There may be some truth to that. Or maybe an aversion to even seeing the film, because you can see from the trailer, \u201cOh, this might make me uncomfortable.\u201d You know? In fact, I think I said that to someone at a party. Barnes: I think its possible to look at it in at least two different ways \u2014 one is simply the practical way of how a single film doesn\u2019t give us enough data to know whether or not it\u2019s lost. But it\u2019s also possible to look into the framework of a history of films of certain political points of view being excluded or discounted. Or psychologically, black people understand that movie on a different level. Actually, there was one guy who was just going on, \u201cwhoever did this movie has no idea about race relations in America\u201d. You know? Just a white guy who thinks he understands what he doesn\u2019t understand. The Dunning-Kruger effect. Ignorance masquerading as wisdom. That we get what Jordan Peele was doing to the point where, whatever qualities are in that film, it is lifted up by our understanding of the truth that is being given to us. It\u2019s like we look at this movie, and \u201cOh my God,\u201d someone is speaking the unspeakable. This isn\u2019t a joke.\n\nDue: Someone said it. But this also the thing\u2014besides the racial possible handicap\u2014it\u2019s also a horror film. And as someone tweeted...I wish I could cite the tweet I saw earlier...where some guy was saying, \u201cOh, those of you who are upset about Get Out being shut out of the Oscars, welcome to being a horror fan.\u201d So there are a lot of people who will not take horror films seriously.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Get Out received four nominations: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Actor. The Oscars are on March 4.)\n\nElaborating on the specifics of the online seminar, Due says they\u2019re hoping to get Peele and Candyman lead actor Tony Todd to appear as they did in the UCLA class. \u201cBut it\u2019s more lecture and discussion-based than special guest-based at this point,\u201d Due says. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly lectures and deep dives into the themes of not only Get Out, but also Candyman, Ganja and Hess\u2014that movie\u2019s take on the vampire mythos\u2014and Beloved.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen asked who might be the ideal people to take the Sunken Place seminar, Barnes singled out three populations. \u201cOne is just the fans who want to understand and have a wider context and deeper understanding of the roots of horror, black horror in America, and our transition from being the monsters in Birth of a Nation to being the ones who fight the monsters. That\u2019s an amazing, heroic journey that we have taken in this country,\u201d he began. \u201cWe also want to be a resource for teachers of black horror to provide them with context, to deepen them, so that they can in turn reach out and touch other people. But also, we want to impact the next generation of the creators of black horror.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI really do think horror is significant socially, period, and has a way of providing a lens that few other kinds of art can. Black horror in particular is especially powerful that way. And I want to spread it like a virus.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all stand on giants,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cBut someone like Jordan Peele has created very broad shoulders, indeed. And so if we understand what he has done\u2014and what some of these other people have done, like what Tony Todd says about the way he approached the acting in Candyman, and what this means to him\u2014it changes things. You\u2019re no longer looking at the surface of the question, now you\u2019re looking underneath. You\u2019re popping up the hood and looking at the actual engine that makes that car work. Most people are just looking at the finish, the color, the paint. Let\u2019s look at the power train. How this works. Why this works. How this can be something that is a transformative experience, culturally. That\u2019s different.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI really do think horror is significant socially, period, and has a way of providing a lens that few other kinds of art can,\u201d said Due. \u201cBlack horror in particular is especially powerful that way. And I want to spread it like a virus. One of the things that was most exciting to me about the UCLA course was that I gave my students the opportunity to write either an essay, or a short story, or make a short film. And in the past, I\u2019ve never had anyone make a film. A few people have written stories. This past year, I got several stories. I got two excellent films. And it just showed me, when you open that door of enlightenment and teach students how to take the feelings that they already have, but express them through horror, boom, we\u2019re ready to go.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDue said she and Barnes want to help create artists. \u201cThat\u2019s a big part of what we want to do, and who we are. So, while it\u2019s more of an academically-oriented course, I hope that through that better intellectual understanding of the material, it will help artists open up their imaginations about how they can take their truth\u2014like Jordan Peele took his truth\u2014and create art with social impact.\u201d\n\n\n\nTo find out how to register for the \u201cThe Sunken Place\u201d web seminar, go here.", "keywords": ["anybody", "black", "peele", "course", "know", "students", "version", "way", "online", "film", "think", "inspired", "horror", "class", "college", "barnes"], "polarity": 0.10579354851906406, "subjectivity": 0.4737300564555716},

For those not in the know, it\u2019s a spinoff from hit ABC show Black-ish that focuses on Shahidi\u2019s character, Zoey, and her journey from super-sheltered private school student to college freshman in this millennial world. Comparisons to A Different World will undoubtedly exist, but fuck that shit. We\u2019re going to let Grown-ish bounce, rock, skate and roll on its own merits, and so far, I\u2019m in.\n\nThe debut episodes brought me back to my college days\u2014kinda; we\u2019ll get to that later\u2014while also infusing enough blackness to keep me interested and anticipating future episodes. Here is a list of 10 things that were awesome (and black) about the first two episodes of Grown-ish.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Let\u2019s start with the most obvious. By a show of hands, how many of you had any idea that the show itself would be on the Freeform network or had even HEARD of Freeform? Nobody? Good. I\u2019m not alone here. It wasn\u2019t until about 7:55 p.m. that I was like ... wait, why for come Grown-ish isn\u2019t showing up on my DirecTV channel guide on ABC?\n\nThen I looked it up online and saw it was on Freeform, cocked my head to the side and said, \u201cWhat the fuck is Freeform?\u201d These niggas just gon\u2019 make us LOOK for new channels? That\u2019s some black shit. Turns out Freeform is an ABC Family network or something. I was annoyed until Disney\u2019s Beauty and the Beast came on after and all was right with the world. Be our guest and shit.\n\n2. The first two episodes were titled \u201cLate Registration\u201d and \u201cBitch Don\u2019t Kill My Vibe,\u201d using the tried-and-true method of naming things after black songs. I\u2019m all in on that level of blackness. It\u2019s a subtle way to infuse blackness that uncool white people won\u2019t understand without the help of a Magical Negro.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Within the FIRST minute, we get footage from Freaknic (RIP), the freakfest that hit its hedonistic stride in the \u201990s, taking over and shutting down the streets of Atlanta every spring, AND Luke\u2019s \u201cI Wanna Rock.\u201d We just hit meta blackness.\n\n4. B.o.B. and Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s song \u201cThe Kids\u201d plays in the first episode. Bobby Ray is a flat-earther, which makes sure to get some Hotep-adjacent nonsense into the episode without making it so blatant. Well-played, Grown-ish. Well-played.\n\n5. I appreciate how Randy\u2019s Donuts\u2014Inglewood, Calif.\u2019s famous landmark shop\u2014has become synonymous with black Los Angeles for all of us outsiders. It\u2019s been in videos, movies and television shows as a marker of \u201cHey, we in the hood now!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Grown-ish, sister singing duo Chloe x Halle play Skylar and Jazlyn Forster, two track stars from the hood (running, not hair)\u2014hence the shot of Randy\u2019s Donuts. What makes this especially black? Glad you asked. They\u2019re signed to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Parkwood Entertainment imprint. We got Beyonc\u00e9 and Inglewood in one fell swoop, killing two black birds with one stone.\n\n6. Here\u2019s some extra-black shit of the \u201cFuck it, maybe nobody will notice\u201d variety: In the first episode, Vivek, the Indian kid who aspires toward Drakeness in life, is a label whore. That\u2019s fine; lots of us are. While they\u2019re showing us his label whoring, the show points out that his shoes are Adidas Yeezy 750 Boosts\u2014EXCEPT THEY\u2019RE NOT. They are Adidas, sure, but they\u2019re Pharrell\u2019s NMD Human Race red joints, an ENTIRELY different shoe. Oh, Grown-ish.\n\n7. They hit up a James Baldwin-themed photo exhibit. Two episodes into a show and we go straight for James Baldwin? Siiiiiiign me up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Zoey trying to knock out a paper on the Notorious RBG, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, at 1 a.m. and then 2 a.m. gave me actual nightmares. I recently told my boy\u2019s son, a soon-to-be high school graduate, that college was the best four years of my life and that I\u2019d go back, even with the work, and do it over. I think I forgot that \u201cdoing the work\u201d actually included writing papers again. I was NOTORIOUS for starting papers at midnight that were due at 8 a.m. and I NEVER LEARNED MY LESSON.\n\nI somehow managed to get a master\u2019s degree like this, culminating in a 50-page \u201cpaper,\u201d including a literature review, bibliography and fully cited sources, on how the government\u2019s HOPE VI housing program was a really good bad idea that displaced tons of black Americans in hopes of spurring gentrification because \u201cthe man\u201d\u2014that I wrote in 36 hours. What makes this a black-ass thing? I just mentioned gentrification. That\u2019s all I got.\n\n9. The character Luca\u2019s entire wardrobe looks inspired by the one and only Ghostface Killah, down to the rings, chains and the robelike clothing he sports in the second episode. He\u2019s who I should have been in college.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. I learned more about drugs in the second episode than I ever did in 38 years of life. Also, this is not true.

And you might not have had that very brave person who happened to have a gun or a rifle go out in his truck and shoot [the gunman] and hit him and neutralize him,\u201d Trump said, referring to Stephen Willeford, the Texas man credited with shooting and chasing off the Sutherland gunman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf he didn\u2019t have a gun, instead of having 26 dead, you would have had hundreds more dead,\u201d Trump continued.\n\nThis point\u2014a common conservative refrain\u2014is worth pausing on.\n\nShockingly, there is a bit of nuance that Trump inadvertently introduces. Per our current gun laws, Devin Kelley, the gunman in Sutherland Springs, should never have had a gun in the first place. Kelly\u2019s domestic violence charges were never entered into a national database, allowing him to pass background checks and buy firearms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is important to remember: We can have the right laws in place, but it doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re not being enforced properly.\n\nStill, the focus on the \u201cgood guy with the gun\u201d being unable to purchase his firearm is ridiculous\u2014there is simply no way of knowing that for sure. News outlets are reporting that Willeford had a rifle and not the sort of semi-automatic weapon that would likely be subject to \u201cextreme gun vetting.\u201d (It\u2019s also worth mentioning that Willeford, as a former National Rifle Association instructor, was also a highly trained marksman, which is not true of many gun owners.)\n\nProclaiming that \u201chundreds\u201d more could have died, so we must be glad that only 26 lives were lost, is shameful and indicates how normalized mass murder has become in the U.S. As USA Today reports, 208 people have died in mass shootings this year alone.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, the reporter asked Trump whether he would consider any gun control policy.\n\n\u201cThe city with the strongest gun laws in our nation is Chicago, and Chicago is a disaster,\u201d Trump answered, brandishing a favorite and demonstrably false response that, in fact, highlights the need for federal gun regulations.\n\nAs a recent NPR fact check noted, Chicago\u2019s gun laws, while tough, are certainly not the strongest in the country. And while the state of Illinois is tough on guns, its neighboring states, Wisconsin and Indiana, aren\u2019t. Guns, like people, can easily move across state borders, and evidence shows that a significant percentage of Chicago\u2019s guns are trafficked in from states with lax gun laws.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRather than talk about Chicago again, the dotard in chief could very well have used South Korea as an example. The last deadly shootings in the country happened in 2015, in two back-to-back incidents. Immediately following the shootings (quite literally, on the first business day after the last incident), the South Korean government moved to track all guns in the country via GPS.\n\nRead more at NBC News.", "keywords": ["grit", "claims", "cheese", "demented", "vetting", "gun", "control", "mass", "difference", "trump", "reporter", "guns", "latest", "south", "extreme", "laws", "korea", "shooting"], "polarity": 0.05356373256373256, "subjectivity": 0.5341286676286676},

Adding insult to injury, there\u2019s even a segment of black men who consider \u201cthe most educated group in the United States\u201d the least desirable.\n\nThese opinions\u2014or \u201cpreferences,\u201d as misogynoirists often call them\u2014originate in racist beliefs that black women are outside the classical concept of womanhood. This \u201cothering\u201d relies on stereotypes of black women as \u201cangry,\u201d \u201cunwomanly\u201d or \u201cmanly\u201d when compared with women of other races. Yet those of us who represent the lifestyle known as \u201cdapper\u201d simultaneously embrace and challenge those stereotypes.\n\nFrom 1920s-era performer Gladys Bentley to 2017 Emmy Award-winning writer Lena Waithe, black women donning menswear have continually asserted themselves in the intersecting conversations of gender identity, fashion and race. We boldly respond to Truth\u2019s query with a resounding, \u201cYes, I am.\u201d\n\nThese conversations inevitably revolve around being \u201cmasculine of center\u201d (MoC), an umbrella term that encompasses all the nuanced characteristics outside of \u201ctraditional\u201d femininity\u2014from the tomboy to the butch/stud. \u201cDapper,\u201d when applied to any and all gender identities, denotes a style of dress noted as much for its precision in execution as its play in pairing. For people of the African Diaspora, it intersects with a cultural history of dandyism best described by Ekow Eshun, curator of the photography exhibit \u201cMade You Look: Dandyism and Black Masculinity.\u201d He describes it as \u201cradical personal politics, a willed flamboyance that flies in the face of conventional constructions of the black masculine.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a dapper queer woman, I\u2019m the beneficiary of evolving social constructs of gender that have far-reaching roots. For instance, to simply say that Harlem Renaissance blues singer Gladys Bentley was a \u201cdrag king\u201d is to rely on the limits of language and time. Bentley, an open lesbian, dressed in menswear and sang blues songs about female lovers. In the 1920s, she was described as \u201cperforming maleness,\u201d yet Bentley enjoyed same-sex relationships and wore suits and ties offstage, as well. And though gender theorist Judith Butler argues that we\u2019re always performing gender in various ways\u2014including what we wear\u2014perhaps it\u2019s fairer to say Bentley was not performing but, rather, presenting herself as a dapper black woman singing songs of her lesbian experience in an unevolved era.\n\nThe misconception that some women dress in suits and ties to either be or imitate men ironically imitates social systems that center men in all things. Speaking for myself, I enjoy the look and feel of how my particular womanhood expresses itself through this style of dress. It isn\u2019t manhood or maleness, but masculinity\u2014a trait most associated with men but not exclusive to them\u2014that I present as a dapper woman. But my affinity for oxfords and bowties have absolutely nothing to do with men.\n\nAs Janelle Mon\u00e1e clapped back at a Twitter user who complained about being \u201ctired of those dumbass suits\u201d she favors: \u201cSit down. I\u2019m not for male consumption.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMenswear and menswear-inspired clothing embrace masculinity, but not necessarily as a rejection of the feminine. Mon\u00e1e epitomizes style as statement; using her wardrobe of suits, bowties and monochromatic colors to honor both her and her parents\u2019 uniformed pasts as domestic workers. Similarly, every Eldredge knot I tie and wingtip I slip into honors and frees a little tomboy in late-\u201970s, early-\u201980s Chicago, forced into stiff lace-ruffled dresses with matching socks and hand-me-down rabbit fur coats.\n\n\n\nAs it turns out, I wasn\u2019t the only budding dapper queer suffocating through girlhood on Chicago\u2019s predominantly black South Side. Recent Emmy winner Lena Waithe\u2019s historymaking episode \u201cThanksgiving\u201d on Netflix\u2019s Master of None serves as an accurate and humorous primer on black queer girlhood. In fact, I watched it with my mother and aunt this Thanksgiving, along with the pilot episode of my own comedy web series, Quare Life (Open TV, beta, 2018).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTogether, these two episodes feature characters rarely represented in a setting often misrepresented: masculine-of-center black women on Chicago\u2019s South Side. If Judith Butler is correct in positing that gender is made up of actions we\u2019ve been socialized to do, maybe coming of age during the rise of hip-hop\u2014which spawned as many unisex fashion trends as misogynist rhymes\u2014influenced Waithe, me and countless girls like us to evolve from baggy sweats and bandannas to tuxedos and bow ties.\n\nMaybe, like Mon\u00e1e, we dress this way as a statement; paying homage to generations of black girls viewed as masculine by default. But more likely, part of #BlackGirlMagic is to slay in whatever we wear, demanding that onlookers and critics recognize who we are, even when it defies convention. Maybe that\u2019s why, when referencing her Emmy-night tuxedo, Lena Waithe said, \u201cI felt like the queen of the night in that thing.\u201d\n\nM Shelly Conner is a Chicago-based writer, humorist and scholar.

What is to blame for this? Regarding the recent Texas church massacre, President Donald Trump stated that this was caused by a \u201cmental health problem.\u201d\n\nIn other words, guns don\u2019t kill people ... yeah, let me stop you there and dispel that myth. In 2015, suicide was the 10th-leading cause of death in the United States. A total of 22,018 people used a firearm to commit suicide. Adding to that number, with the 12,979 homicides that were carried out using a firearm, there were 34,997 total deaths caused by firearm in the United States in 2015, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s only November, but 2017 has been considered the deadliest year for mass shootings in modern U.S. history. This despite the fact that the 1921 Tulsa, Okla., race riot; the 1923 Rosewood, Fla., massacre; and the 1890 massacre at Wounded Knee, just to name a few, all had greater tragic losses of life in a single instance in this country.\n\n\n\nFor the record, the current federal definition of a mass killing (pdf) is \u201cthree or more killings in a single incident and must occur in a place of public use.\u201d So far, there have been 112 people killed and 531 people wounded in mass shootings this year. To put it bluntly, guns definitely kill people ... a lot of people.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Trump\u2019s answer to these violent events is a very convenient and plausible excuse for the population as it pertains to mental health because of two things: 1) the population doesn\u2019t know a lot about mental illness to begin with, and 2) they don\u2019t want to know about mental illness. So this seems like it would make sense.\n\nBut people who have more than just a cursory knowledge of mental illness will tell you that this likely isn\u2019t mental illness.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s line of thinking has been a popular excuse for people committing violent crimes and crimes in general. But mental illness is responsible only for 3 to 5 percent of violent crimes. This means that the people who are committing violent crimes are far more likely\u201419 times more likely\u2014not to have a mental illness.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA good rule of thumb for most things is to understand one main concept: There is a difference between mental illness and bad behavior.\n\n\n\nJust because someone does something that is unusual or not normal to you does not mean, by default, that someone is mentally ill. I get it\u2014these events cause shock, disgust and make you feel sick. However, if there is no evaluation, you should probably err on the side of bad behavior. If the shooter was killed, there is little else to go off of other than family members, who might suffer from recall or responder bias, which makes any evaluation ultimately unreliable.\n\nA person who has not previously been diagnosed with a mental illness and who commits a violent crime is likely not suffering from mental illness and is probably just evil. Yes, I know, there is no Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 designation for being evil. Which is why being a bad person isn\u2019t a mental illness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is more likely that these are horrible people with poor coping skills ... and access to firearms. Don\u2019t believe me? OK, consider this: If someone shot and killed your relative, what are you thinking of first? That the shooter had a mental illness or that the shooter was simply a horrible person? Exactly.\n\n\n\nNeed another example? OK. What if your roommate was secretly poisoning you and posting on Instagram step-by-step everything she or he did to you? Would you think that your roommate had a mental illness or that your roommate was a horrible person? Too easy.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHave you noticed that with respect to people who commit a violent crime, the benefit of the doubt about whether they\u2019re suffering from mental illness is inversely proportional to the amount of melanin in their body?\n\n\n\nIf you have a lot of melanin, you are considered a thug, a terrorist and un-American. However, if you have very little melanin, you are mentally ill and are worthy of people suggesting that you had an undiagnosed, and unknown, mental illness, personality disorder or any number of other maladies, and you deserve some compassion.\n\nAfter all, why else would someone with privilege commit a crime? Affluenza, anyone?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be clear, I am not caping for terrorism, foreign or domestic.\n\nHowever, the selective framing and cognitive dissonance that seems to dominate the narrative of these types of incidents makes the optics of perceptions of mental illness and mental health look bad, and it is the wrong way to address these events.\n\n\n\nThe ramification of using mental illness as a scapegoat increases the stigma that is attached to mental illness. This stigma makes people far less likely to seek out professional help to improve their mental health. Not to mention it also increases the criminalization of mental illness, when, in fact, people who have mental illness are 10 times more likely to be the victims of violent crime, not the perpetrators of crime.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t expect Congress to do anything about it. It did nothing when the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shootings occurred in Newtown, Conn. Hell, members of Congress were actually shot at and kept right on going like nothing happened. If they don\u2019t care about their own lives, I am certain they don\u2019t care about yours. But, hey, thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n\nNeither thoughts nor prayers are going to be able to stop a bullet or people\u2019s suffering.\n\nBy the way, those survivors and family members of the victims? They are dealing with mental health challenges as they struggle to understand why their loved ones were tragically taken away and why the government repeatedly fails to prevent these senseless losses of life caused by people behaving badly.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough, if this is a mental health problem, perhaps Trump is to blame, because he did sign into law a bill that rolled back an Obama-administration measure that had made it harder for people with mental illness to procure firearms.\n\n\n\nBut when you have shock, disgust and emotion, who needs facts?\n\n\n\nTerrance McGill, M.D., MPH, specializes in preventive medicine, mental health and addiction medicine.

The film was adapted from the 2008 Hillary Jordan novel about two families\u2014one black and one white\u2014attempting to stay afloat by sharecropping the same patch of hard Mississippi acreage in the World War II era.\n\nI won\u2019t drop any spoilers here, but Mudbound is a captivating watch\u2014the film was nominated for two Golden Globes (though it ultimately lost), and Mary J. Blige is a revelation as a matriarch. It excels in large part because of its dedication to authenticity, including how whites treated black folks (and how blacks had to treat whites in order to survive) in the Jim Crow South. The rage-whitening of your black knuckles only intensifies as the movie creeps toward its climax, and once it\u2019s done, you\u2019re left with the residue of anger at our treatment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCertain period films allow us to escape to days long past with a relative certainty that the technology, mindsets and quality of life portrayed have permanently evolved, but black Americans\u2014most of whom, at the very least, have living parents or grandparents who faced legal consequences for using the same toilet as white people\u2014aren\u2019t afforded the luxury of viewing such things passively. Mudbound is set some seven decades ago, but in a #MakeAmericaGreatAgain, tiki-torch, George Zimmerman-still-walks-as-a-free-man America that reminds you just how little shit has changed since then, it\u2019s not so easy to divorce oneself from the fact that it\u2019s just a movie.\n\nAnd really, there\u2019s a metric-ass ton of films that evoke these feelings within us. Damon Young created a list a few years back, but he only scratched the surface of what could easily be a 5,000-word article. So here\u2019s a very nonexhaustive list of films that make me kinda wanna trip Kaitlyn as she strolls out of Lululemon:\n\nDetroit (2017)\n\nAudiences pretty much steered clear of this film, which is based on the 1967 Detroit rebellion, likely because they heard that the middle hour is like a Saw film for racially motivated police brutality. Detroit is actually a decent film, and I was one of the few black reviewers who gave it praise. But after watching a press screening, I skipped out on the star-studded world premiere for the same reason I\u2019ll likely never watch the film again: because ain\u2019t nobody got time to be miserable for the rest of the afternoon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMurder in Mississippi (1990)\n\nThis made-for-TV movie starring Blair Underwood traumatized me when I was a young child with an inchoate understanding of racism. Based on the real-life murder of civil rights activists by the Ku Klux Klan in the 1960s, the film\u2019s protagonists inspired 8-year-old me before I had to watch them get dragged out of their vehicles and executed in the conclusion. They might as well have clipped Mr. Rogers in front of me. I haven\u2019t laid eyes on this film for the better part of 30 years, but it\u2019s the only reason I refused to stop for gas when driving through Mississippi at night while in my 20s.\n\n\n\nDead Presidents (1995)\n\nIt\u2019s not always the films that feature explicit white-on-black violence. Dead Presidents masterfully depicts the black American condition as it\u2019s affected by the sublimation of overt racism: Young black and brown men fight the white man\u2019s war (Vietnam here, but isn\u2019t every war the white man\u2019s war?), only to return home with addictions, illness, injuries, emotional trauma and scarce financial options. Not even the liberal use of Terrence Howard\u2019s \u201cmayne,\u201d Clifton Powell\u2019s \u201cnyuguh\u201d or the best soundtrack ever make the conclusion less depressing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerican History X (1998)\n\nThough it\u2019s in my top 10 all-time favorite films, this white nationalist redemption tale is never too easy to take in. Edward Norton\u2019s Derek Vinyard is a nasty Nazi bastard before eventually becoming a sympathetic character, and Stacy Keach\u2019s predatory patriarch motivating children to hate is infuriating. And of course, there\u2019s that curbside scene\u2014hit the \u201cplay\u201d button on the above video if you, too, wish to be pissed off.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPitch Perfect movies\n\nIncluded in this list because I can\u2019t think of a series that better personifies the unbridled caucasity that is the Hollywood machine than one that portrays the \u201ccompetitive\u201d world of collegiate a cappella as comedy. The industry is doing a better-than-ever job of green-lighting the stories of marginalized voices, and Moonlight getting the Oscars drop on Fluffernutter-sandwich-turned-cinematic-experience La La Land was monumental. But it\u2019s still tough to see Pitch Perfect films being made even when no one asked for them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGet Out (2017)\n\nPretty much every white person in Jordan Peele\u2019s blockbuster is written to appall. But there\u2019s a unique animus that should be reserved for Allison Williams\u2019 Rose Armitage, the (spoiler alert) main cog in the machine of a family that subverts and \u201ctransforms\u201d black folks into modern-day slaves. I\u2019m sayin\u2019 \u2026 she should\u2019ve gotten it much worse in the end.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDjango Unchained (2012)\n\nMuch has been written about Quentin Tarantino\u2019s liberal use of the n-word in his films, but few will argue that the man can\u2019t write a good revenge tale. Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s unctuous plantation owner is impressively reprehensible as a man who forces his slaves to participate in some ungodly mixed martial arts for his amusement. But it\u2019s the scene in which dogs tear a slave to pieces that makes us root for Jamie Foxx\u2019s Django to snatch the life of every human of European descent on-screen.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSurviving the Game (1994)\n\nAn entire movie centered on rich white men (and Charles S. \u201cRoc\u201d Dutton) hunting a homeless black man for sport. Get past the action-thriller aspect of the film (which isn\u2019t too shabby for the early 1990s) and focus on the optics of Ice-T\u2019s down-on-his-luck widower thinking he\u2019s catching a break at the hands of some well-meaning white folks who are all betting on being the first to off him. It\u2019s fitting that Rutger Hauer, the poster boy for Hollywood bad guys whom you\u2019d probably steer clear of in real life, plays the main antagonist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosewood (1997)\n\nYeah, I know Damon has this on his list.

The celebrity DJ-model-producer (and much more) shifted the paradigm in our favor in 2006 when she founded Black Girls Rock!, the award show and nonprofit organization that has since earned worldwide acclaim.\n\nFittingly, Bond literally holds the trademark to \u201cBlack Girl Magic\u201d\u2014a phrase she recently discovered may have originated in friend and author Joan Morgan\u2019s \u201990s hip-hop feminist tome When Chickenheads Come Home to Roost. Bond loves that the expression has become a recent addition to our common lexicon about black womanhood, as she has made it her mission to help as many girls find their magic as possible.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to know everything, but you might know somebody that knows something else, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been able to do [with] Black Girls Rock!\u2014I\u2019ve been able to tap into our village to help me bring this to life and do this work.\n\nNow eBay is recognizing and supporting Bond\u2019s efforts by partnering with Black Girls Rock! for an epic inaugural auction to raise funds for the organization in honor of Black History Month. Launched on Feb. 5, the auction features such gems as a pair of worn and signed ballet shoes from Misty Copeland, coveted red-carpet access to the next Black Girls Rock! award show and signed copies of Bond\u2019s upcoming Black Girls Rock! book, which debuts on Feb. 27 and is already the No. 1 book in preorders on Amazon.com\u2014as well as the first prize to sell out on the eBay auction. As Bond tells The Glow Up:\n\nYou know, I\u2019m just really grateful\u2014it\u2019s exciting to see that people are receiving it so well. But also, it speaks to the importance of the message continuing\u2014the need for the message ... In 2006, when I started Black Girls Rock!, there wasn\u2019t this celebration, acknowledgment [or] inclusion of black women\u2019s narratives, stories, beauty, diversity, nuances\u2014it just wasn\u2019t there in media\u2014in fact, it was completely the opposite, if anything. And so to see where the world has come to now, in this time, and to see all this \u201cBlack Girl Magic\u201d surfacing\u2014or people discovering [it]\u2014it\u2019s just an incredible thing, to know that Black Girls Rock! was very much at the forefront of this movement. It means a lot, but I don\u2019t get fooled by trends ... I feel that the work needs to continue there, and I know that we have to continue to push our message, our narrative, and keep our presence in the forefront. We matter and our voices matter, and our accomplishments matter, our contributions matter, our achievements matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupporting the accomplishments and achievements of future generations is at the heart of Black Girls Rock!, and 100 percent of proceeds from the auction will go back into the organization\u2019s programs, like the Black Girls Lead conference and camps, which have yielded proven results through mentorship, as Bond tells us:\n\nWe are really giving girls tools that they need to empower themselves to take their best to their \u201cbestest\u201d; to go to their next level. And so it\u2019s been really successful. We have a lot of incredible girls that have gone through our programs that stay connected with us, that are now in college. Some of them are graduating [and] going into the business world now. So you know, just to see this work over this time, and to see girls that we\u2019ve literally been surrogate mothers to, in a sense, grow into these incredible young women, it\u2019s been amazing to see.\n\nTo understand the potential impact of a juggernaut like eBay joining forces with Black Girls Rock!, to date, eBay for Charity has raised nearly $810 million for participating charities, raising $84 million in 2017 alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe auction is live until Feb. 15, and the following items and experiences are still up for grabs:\n\nBallet shoes worn and signed by Misty Copeland.\n\n\n\nVIP Experience at the 2018 Black Girls Rock!

You can also add an additional donation to your purchase during checkout. Remember\u2014100 percent of proceeds benefit Black Girls Rock!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBond hopes that this auction will be the first of many as she continues to grow Black Girls Rock! and ensure that #BlackGirlMagic remains more than a catchphrase, hashtag or trend. She\u2019s constantly strategizing new ways to do the work of elevating us\u2014and hopes that more will do the same:\n\nIt\u2019s easier to do the work than we think it is. And I think that sometimes people get so caught up in the idea [that] it takes so much to start a charity or start a mentoring program. And it really just takes whatever knowledge and skill that you have, using that to empower the next person. You don\u2019t have to know everything, but you might know somebody that knows something else, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been able to do in this time of building Black Girls Rock!\u2014both the award show and the nonprofit. I\u2019ve been able to kind of tap into the community and tap into our village to help me bring this to life and help me do this work. And I think that eBay has joined our village, and I think that\u2019s the beautiful part about this partnership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: The Black Girls Rock! auction is live now through Feb. 15; Pintrill pins are available throughout the month of February.

According to The New York Times, this amounts to some 7% of the town\u2019s population. While details are still unspooling, the county sheriff told The Washington Post that a large number of the victims\u2014somewhere between 12 to 14 of the people who were killed and injured\u2014were children. According to state officials, a child as young as 18 months was among the dead.\n\n\n\nThe massacre in Texas is the deadliest mass shooting of children since Sandy Hook. People will mourn the loss of these young lives as a wake-up call for gun control. But while the shooting in Texas was undeniably gruesome, it was not a unique incident for children in this country. The fact is that in America, more children are shot on a daily basis than the number that were shot in Texas on Sunday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a study on children and firearm injuries, published in the journal Pediatrics in June by researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the University of Texas, approximately 19 children a day die or receive emergency treatment for a gunshot wound in the United States. The study, which is one of the most comprehensive of its kind, found that in total, between 2012 and 2014, an average of nearly 1,300 children died and 5,790 were treated for gunshot wounds every year.\n\nAnother analysis by The Washington Post using more recent data from 2015 found that on average, 23 children were shot each day that year. This is a uniquely American problem\u2014one study published in the American Journal of Medicine found that in 2010, among high-income countries, 91 percent of children aged 0 to 14 killed by firearms came from the United States.\n\nChildren are shot on a daily basis, but the epidemic largely gets swept under the rug outside of the shock of mass shootings like those in Texas and Sandy Hook. This might have to do with the racial disparity of which children are affected by gun violence\u2014according to the Pediatrics study, black children have the highest rate of firearm mortality overall, at 4.1 per 100,000 versus 1.5 per 100,000 for white children. While white and American Indian children have higher rates of death by firearm suicide, the disparity mostly results from black children having higher rates of death by firearm homicides. A huge proportion of these children who die from firearms overall\u201482 percent\u2014are male, and most are older, between the ages of 13 and 17.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat happened in Texas is horrifying. But as we go through the ritualistic steps of processing the massacres that have become woven into the fabric of American life, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that we simply can\u2019t talk about gun violence without addressing the fact that children, disproportionately black boys, are dying every day. And those who survive gun violence face ongoing trauma.\n\n\u201cWhen the physical wound is repaired, there\u2019s still another wound\u2014one that can be lifelong,\u201d Arthur Lurigio, a clinical psychologist, told ABC News earlier this year. \u201cOnce a child has been shot, their illusion of safety is completely and utterly shattered.\u201d\n\nAccording to another CDC report, increased risk for youth violence and crime is associated with many factors, including concentrated poverty, unemployment, crowded housing, and neighborhood violence and crime. When looking at the problem of gun violence and children as a whole, it\u2019s clear that tighter gun laws are an important, but only partial, solution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithout putting this reality at the front and center, the gun control debate has too much potential to err on the side of increasing the policing of minorities rather than fixing the root problems that engender gun violence. For example, as Patrick Blanchfield pointed out in an essay for n+1 last year, the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban was part of the larger crime bill signed into law by Bill Clinton that produced many of the frameworks for mass incarceration, like harsh sentencing guidelines and billions in funding for new prison construction. Blanchfield writes:\n\nGiven that today\u2019s Aversive Minimalists include many white liberals whose primary concerns vis-\u00e0-vis \u201cgun violence\u201d more or less boil down to making high-profile rampage killings disappear from their newsfeeds, the possibility that they will embrace measures that gesture at solving that problem while doubling down on militarized policing, surveillance, and America\u2019s overcrowded prisons is depressingly easy to imagine. As many critics have observed, we would be na\u00efve to think that heavy-handed gun control measures would not involve the same disproportionate racial targeting and police violence we rightly condemn in the War on Drugs and in everyday encounters in places from Baltimore to Ferguson to Cleveland to Oakland.\n\nThe gun control debate often swirls around the trends illuminated by the massacre of the month. By failing to focus on the overall issue\u2014one that is inextricably linked with poverty, segregation, and racism\u2014children will continue to suffer. That somewhere around a dozen children were shot in Texas on Sunday is a tragedy, but it\u2019s also one that families face across the country every single day.\n\n", "keywords": ["texas", "children", "killed", "gun", "number", "control", "study", "day", "firearm", "violence", "shot", "america", "american", "kids"], "polarity": 0.05063679288362833, "subjectivity": 0.4107891756625934},

She received the Cecil B.

She bigged up the press, and then she took the children to church.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI value the press more than ever before as we try to navigate these complicated times. Which brings me to this,\u201d Oprah said, pausing, and then giving us this:\n\nWhat I know for sure is that speaking your truth is the most powerful tool we all have. But it\u2019s not just a story affecting the entertainment industry, it\u2019s one that transcends any culture, geography, race, religion, politics or workplace. So I want tonight to express gratitude to all the women who have endured years of abuse and assault because they had children to feed and bills to pay and dreams to pursue. They\u2019re the women whose names we\u2019ll never know; they are domestic workers and farmworkers. They are working in factories and they work in restaurants and they\u2019re in academia and engineering and medicine and science. They are part of the world of tech and politics and business. They are athletes in the Olympics and they are soldiers in the military.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then she came back to Taylor.\n\n\u201cShe came back to live, as we all have lived, in a culture broken by brutally powerful men. For too long, women have not been heard or believed if they speak their truth to the power of those men. But their time is up. The time is up!\u201d Oprah roared.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe audience leaped to their feet.

For example, if the Coagula Process is out in the world and has been in use for a while, then other racist mad scientists could be using it and changing it up. And, as far as thematic concerns, racism (and other prejudices) doesn\u2019t always present in the same way. A Get Out sequel would have plenty of space to play in if Peele ever commits to doing one\u2014though he added, \u201cI would have to have a story that I feel would take it up a notch.\u201d", "keywords": ["world", "consider", "wraps", "seriously", "peele", "feel", "using", "sequel", "wanna", "sequeli", "way", "jordan", "writerdirector"], "polarity": -0.0066391941391941356, "subjectivity": 0.3568681318681319},

Until every man is fighting for our rights, we should consider stopping having sex.\u201d \u2014Janelle Mon\u00e1e\n\nCome again? In a recent interview with Marie Claire, singer Janelle Mon\u00e1e discussed her ideas when it comes to participating in resistance. I\u2019m not going to lie: As a hot-blooded, fully grown and liberated woman who is in both her sexual prime and a happily grown-and-sexy relationship, reading this quote from one of Marie Claire\u2019s newest cover girls gave me serious pause (and a possible eyeball sprain). For all its noble\u2014albeit idealistic\u2014intention, my entire body recoiled at this stream of logic (aside from its being a wholly unappealing concept).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMon\u00e1e may presumably be willing to give up her interactive \u201cYoga\u201d habit until all of mankind is fighting for and alongside womankind, but suggesting that we wait until men get on board, en masse? With all due respect to her vagina\u2014and utmost respect for my own\u2014I felt cobwebs beginning to form at the mere thought ...\n\nOf course, Mon\u00e1e\u2019s position (pun intended) isn\u2019t a novel one. From the ancient Greek comedy Lysistrata\u2014which inspired Spike Lee\u2019s controversial film Chi-raq\u2014to Poland\u2019s most recent iteration of \u201cBlack Monday\u201d as an anti-abortion protest, withholding sex has long been considered potentially the ultimate weapon, capable of compelling social change, ending violence and asserting female power. Admittedly, the results have been mixed; but it\u2019s a resistance tactic that continues to resurface, increasingly in the name of feminism, since sex is often considered a \u201cgendered activity.\u201d\n\nSee? There\u2019s that pesky record scratch again. How do I count the ways in which this is problematic for me?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Problem of the Pussy\n\nWell, let\u2019s start with the obvious, which, ironically, is reducing women\u2019s worth quite literally to the sum of their parts. As much as we extol the much-lauded \u201cpower of the pussy,\u201d are women\u2014who statistically suffer the highest percentage of sexual assaults\u2014really expected to (still) consider our sexual availability our best bargaining tactic? Does the \u201cDay Without a (Vagina)\u201d approach truly advance any conversation about female liberation? And specifically, when the agency and autonomy of our bodies is still actively up for debate, is dangling sex like a carrot really our best argument? Is our humanity not enough to justify our rights?\n\nThe Ms. in \u201cMisogyny\u201d\n\nAs much as I personally respect the yoni, let\u2019s be honest: #NotAllWomen do. Fifty-three percent of white women made that abundantly clear last November. Truthfully, the women\u2019s movement has so much work to do on itself that convincing men to act in our best interests is only part of the problem. Inclusion, intersectionality and misogyny are not just male issues; multitudes of women exclude, fear and outright hate other women\u2014enough to vote against ourselves and/or other women\u2019s autonomy, long after fighting to get the vote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd truth be told, for every male armchair pundit advising that women think more like men in order to get one, there\u2019s a woman teaching other women that they aren\u2019t fit to be mated (to a man, at least) without \u201cwife school.\u201d So much for sisterhood.\n\n#NotAllMen\n\nAs much as I\u2019d like to keep this centered on the women, let\u2019s address men for a second. You know, the hypothetical men from whom we heterosexual women (because apparently none of this logic applies to same-sex, non-gender-binary, etc., relationships) should be withholding sex until they\u2014and all their comrades\u2014get with the program. As Mon\u00e1e states (and I wholeheartedly agree): \u201cI love men. But evil men? I will not tolerate that. You don\u2019t deserve to be in my presence.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUndoubtedly, not every man deserves access to the good stuff, including our pussy-grabber-in-chief. But if not all women unilaterally respect the vagina, it\u2019s equally true that #NotAllMen disrespect it\u2014or the women attached. And no, I\u2019m not talking solely about card-carrying, self-proclaimed \u201cmale feminists\u201d who\u2019ve made themselves known as of late. Admittedly, the jury\u2019s still out on a lot of those dudes.\n\nBut what about your average, respects-his-mama/sister/ex-girlfriends, secure-enough-in-his-nontoxic-masculinity-to-find-feminism-nonthreatening, believes-in-equal-rights-because-it\u2019s-basic-common-sense dude? Frankly, there are far more of them than flag-waving, possibly trend-riding male feminists, and while they may not be schooled on feminist theory, in my experience, they\u2019re often willing to learn. Should we not be willing to teach them (night classes, anyone)? Which leads me to my next concern:\n\nWhose Pussy Is This?\n\nPerhaps the most unnerving part of \u201cLysistratic nonaction,\u201das it is called in feminist resistance circles, is the concept of sex as a \u201cgendered activity,\u201d rather than as a mutual\u2014and, ideally, equal\u2014exchange between consenting adults. Personally, I consider sex as much of a human right as anything else. But more important, giving up that right is a concession to the same oppressive patriarchy we\u2019re fighting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s using sex as a weapon against a system that already sexually objectifies women. To me, it sounds like another attempt to use the master\u2019s tools to dismantle the master\u2019s house (shoutout to Audre Lorde). I know the worth of my womanhood; I refuse to punish myself or concede my sexual power (or pleasure) to those already intent on ignoring it.\n\nBut I will conduct my due diligence. As Mon\u00e1e says, \u201cI have learned there is power in saying no. I have agency. I get to decide.\u201d And discernment is key. Not all masculinity is toxic. Not all women are feminists. But for those of us who both consider ourselves feminists/womanists and choose to share our bodies\u2014and lives\u2014with men, our commitment to feminism is inextricable from our commitment to those men. With whom we choose to share ourselves reflects that commitment. And yes, sometimes that means saying no.\n\nTo Mon\u00e1e\u2019s credit, she recognizes this also, and she has since clarified her controversial statement in a series of tweets explaining that, no, she doesn\u2019t believe sex is a bargaining tool:", "keywords": ["consider", "respect", "sex", "male", "resistance", "womens", "romance", "willing", "men", "women", "power", "sexual"], "polarity": 0.14658908507223117, "subjectivity": 0.4967763509898342},

Sleight\n\nIf a white filmmaker had made this small, contemplative superhero origin story, it would have been enough to convince studio executives to give him a chance to make a big-budget genre film. Instead, many have still heard of neither the film nor J.D. Dillard, the black writer and director. Sleight takes seriously the question of what would happen if a superhero were to come out of a South Central, Calif., milieu. This is one of the most original superhero films of 2017.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Strong Island\n\nThis is a beautiful, devastating film about the 1992 murder of the filmmaker\u2019s brother that occurred on New York\u2019s Long Island and how, because the victim was black and the perpetrator white, justice remains elusive. Yet while Yance Ford explores the crime, he is more interested in what grief did to his family because they were forced to move forward without resolution. This is required viewing.\n\n\n\n3. Mudbound\n\nDirected by Dee Rees of Pariah fame and co-written by her and Virgil Williams, this Netflix original film examines how racism and war forever change two families\u2014one white, the other black\u2014struggling to survive in early-20th-century America. Mary J. Blige gives a powerful performance as the matriarch of the Jackson family. I expect her to receive an Oscar nomination for her role.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Girls Trip\n\nThe comedy of the year follows a group of black women as they reconnect in New Orleans during the Essence Festival. If you haven\u2019t seen this, shame on you\u2014but be warned: You\u2019ll never look at grapefruit the same again.\n\n\n\n1. Get Out\n\nThis is the movie of 2017. While it has been analyzed and discussed ad nauseam, the fact that Jordan Peele called this a documentary, not a fictional tale, is one of the most insightful comments he could have made about the film.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext, the best television:\n\n5. Black-ish\n\nIn the same way that we take LeBron James for granted, we also take for granted this show\u2019s consistent greatness. It tells the hard truths about being black in America without losing sight of the joy that being black can bring. The fact that it does this on network TV and has not yet been canceled is a testament to the writing and acting on the show.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Underground\n\nAlthough it was canceled, this was one of the most original shows of the year. There were many narrative questions left unanswered, but that does not take away from the fact that this season was brilliant.\n\n\n\n3. Greenleaf\n\nThis season of Greenleaf was an honest examination of homophobia, class, family and pettiness within the black church. It doesn\u2019t hide the revered institution\u2019s imperfections; nor is it cynical about the good that can be found between those four walls. This and Queen Sugar are proof that Oprah has become the 21st century\u2019s patron saint of black visual art.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Queen Sugar\n\nIt was hard to put this at No. 2 because of the beauty and honesty of the show, which, in no small part, is because black women are deeply involved in the writing, direction and running of the show. Yet while the direction and writing of this show are top-notch, the performances of the actors in the series that is in the No. 1 spot, plus the sheer ubiquitous nature of that show\u2019s cultural conversation, are what place it just above this one.\n\n\n\n1. Insecure\n\nPart of why Issa Rae\u2019s HBO original series became a social media phenomenon is that each character in the show is so well-written, you can see why they make the poor decisions they do while still being angry with them for making those choices. The only thing I would change is the male lead\u2019s name. He is out here messing it up for everyone named Lawrence.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI mean, I am Team Lawrence, but I ain\u2019t team that dude.", "keywords": ["cut", "didnt", "black", "series", "original", "2017", "shes", "white", "superhero", "family", "film", "shows", "gotta", "writing", "tv", "movies"], "polarity": 0.11444075587334017, "subjectivity": 0.450336227442969},

The film was adapted from the 2008 Hillary Jordan novel about two families\u2014one black and one white\u2014attempting to stay afloat by sharecropping the same patch of hard Mississippi acreage in the World War II era.\n\nI won\u2019t drop any spoilers here, but Mudbound is a captivating watch\u2014the film was nominated for two Golden Globes (though it ultimately lost), and Mary J. Blige is a revelation as a matriarch. It excels in large part because of its dedication to authenticity, including how whites treated black folks (and how blacks had to treat whites in order to survive) in the Jim Crow South. The rage-whitening of your black knuckles only intensifies as the movie creeps toward its climax, and once it\u2019s done, you\u2019re left with the residue of anger at our treatment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCertain period films allow us to escape to days long past with a relative certainty that the technology, mindsets and quality of life portrayed have permanently evolved, but black Americans\u2014most of whom, at the very least, have living parents or grandparents who faced legal consequences for using the same toilet as white people\u2014aren\u2019t afforded the luxury of viewing such things passively. Mudbound is set some seven decades ago, but in a #MakeAmericaGreatAgain, tiki-torch, George Zimmerman-still-walks-as-a-free-man America that reminds you just how little shit has changed since then, it\u2019s not so easy to divorce oneself from the fact that it\u2019s just a movie.\n\nAnd really, there\u2019s a metric-ass ton of films that evoke these feelings within us. Damon Young created a list a few years back, but he only scratched the surface of what could easily be a 5,000-word article. So here\u2019s a very nonexhaustive list of films that make me kinda wanna trip Kaitlyn as she strolls out of Lululemon:\n\nDetroit (2017)\n\nAudiences pretty much steered clear of this film, which is based on the 1967 Detroit rebellion, likely because they heard that the middle hour is like a Saw film for racially motivated police brutality. Detroit is actually a decent film, and I was one of the few black reviewers who gave it praise. But after watching a press screening, I skipped out on the star-studded world premiere for the same reason I\u2019ll likely never watch the film again: because ain\u2019t nobody got time to be miserable for the rest of the afternoon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMurder in Mississippi (1990)\n\nThis made-for-TV movie starring Blair Underwood traumatized me when I was a young child with an inchoate understanding of racism. Based on the real-life murder of civil rights activists by the Ku Klux Klan in the 1960s, the film\u2019s protagonists inspired 8-year-old me before I had to watch them get dragged out of their vehicles and executed in the conclusion. They might as well have clipped Mr. Rogers in front of me. I haven\u2019t laid eyes on this film for the better part of 30 years, but it\u2019s the only reason I refused to stop for gas when driving through Mississippi at night while in my 20s.\n\n\n\nDead Presidents (1995)\n\nIt\u2019s not always the films that feature explicit white-on-black violence. Dead Presidents masterfully depicts the black American condition as it\u2019s affected by the sublimation of overt racism: Young black and brown men fight the white man\u2019s war (Vietnam here, but isn\u2019t every war the white man\u2019s war?), only to return home with addictions, illness, injuries, emotional trauma and scarce financial options. Not even the liberal use of Terrence Howard\u2019s \u201cmayne,\u201d Clifton Powell\u2019s \u201cnyuguh\u201d or the best soundtrack ever make the conclusion less depressing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerican History X (1998)\n\nThough it\u2019s in my top 10 all-time favorite films, this white nationalist redemption tale is never too easy to take in. Edward Norton\u2019s Derek Vinyard is a nasty Nazi bastard before eventually becoming a sympathetic character, and Stacy Keach\u2019s predatory patriarch motivating children to hate is infuriating. And of course, there\u2019s that curbside scene\u2014hit the \u201cplay\u201d button on the above video if you, too, wish to be pissed off.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPitch Perfect movies\n\nIncluded in this list because I can\u2019t think of a series that better personifies the unbridled caucasity that is the Hollywood machine than one that portrays the \u201ccompetitive\u201d world of collegiate a cappella as comedy. The industry is doing a better-than-ever job of green-lighting the stories of marginalized voices, and Moonlight getting the Oscars drop on Fluffernutter-sandwich-turned-cinematic-experience La La Land was monumental. But it\u2019s still tough to see Pitch Perfect films being made even when no one asked for them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGet Out (2017)\n\nPretty much every white person in Jordan Peele\u2019s blockbuster is written to appall. But there\u2019s a unique animus that should be reserved for Allison Williams\u2019 Rose Armitage, the (spoiler alert) main cog in the machine of a family that subverts and \u201ctransforms\u201d black folks into modern-day slaves. I\u2019m sayin\u2019 \u2026 she should\u2019ve gotten it much worse in the end.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDjango Unchained (2012)\n\nMuch has been written about Quentin Tarantino\u2019s liberal use of the n-word in his films, but few will argue that the man can\u2019t write a good revenge tale. Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s unctuous plantation owner is impressively reprehensible as a man who forces his slaves to participate in some ungodly mixed martial arts for his amusement. But it\u2019s the scene in which dogs tear a slave to pieces that makes us root for Jamie Foxx\u2019s Django to snatch the life of every human of European descent on-screen.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSurviving the Game (1994)\n\nAn entire movie centered on rich white men (and Charles S. \u201cRoc\u201d Dutton) hunting a homeless black man for sport. Get past the action-thriller aspect of the film (which isn\u2019t too shabby for the early 1990s) and focus on the optics of Ice-T\u2019s down-on-his-luck widower thinking he\u2019s catching a break at the hands of some well-meaning white folks who are all betting on being the first to off him. It\u2019s fitting that Rutger Hauer, the poster boy for Hollywood bad guys whom you\u2019d probably steer clear of in real life, plays the main antagonist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosewood (1997)\n\nYeah, I know Damon has this on his list. But John Singleton\u2019s best film not named Boyz n the Hood remains the gold standard of don\u2019t-bring-your-Anglo-ass-anywhere-within-10-yards-of-me-after-I-watch-this filmmaking. Based on a real-life 1920s massacre following the lie of a white woman on a black man, not many films before or since Rosewood have so unflinchingly depicted raw white brutality on black bodies.

I loved that song as most people did. Jidenna as an artist, though, I was ambivalent about. Sure it was a dope song, but how many artists come with dope songs and disappear into the ether only to show up decades later on VH1 \u201cOne Hit Wonder\u201d shows because they had nothing else to really offer.\n\nI couldn\u2019t tell just how talented (or not) Jidenna was.

Which brings us to this past Tuesday when I decided to peruse Apple Music to find Future\u2019s new album, scrolled and saw that Jidenna released his debut album, The Chief. Did I care? Not really, but shit, I\u2019m in the car and have another 7 hours to drive, #minuswell give it some run.\n\nWell shut my mouth wide open, Jidenna\u2019s album was a revelation and a total surprise. After running through it a few times, I decided that people needed to not only know his album dropped, but needed to listen to it. I'm still undecided on how good it is though I enjoy it, but its definitely worth a listen. So here are 9 reasons why you need to check out The Chief.\n\n2. Jidenna is an actual artist who, according to the liner notes, is involved in the production just as much as the writing. Piggybacking on the first bullet, this isn\u2019t just a rap album, it\u2019s a piece of art. He\u2019s rapping and singing, and does both very well. Obviously, his association with Janelle Monae and the Wondaland Arts Society means that he\u2019s not just a typical artist, but I was surprised at the depth because I only really knew \u201cClassic Man\u201d and really didn\u2019t like \u201cLong Live The Chief\u201d at all, which is on this album.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. He\u2019s socially conscious while still being very much a nigga. He\u2019s basically all of us who frequent websites like Very Smart Brothas, who give a shit while being able to wax poetic about wings versus flats, grits, and the merits of Hennessy.\n\n4. The song \u201cTrampoline\u201d is basically \u201cI Am Not My Hair\u201d 2017, except written from the male perspective. Sure a woman may like to bounce her ass up and down like a trampoline (really, who doesn\u2019t?), but that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s a tramp; she could be a wife, mother, doctor, etc. Effectively, everybody needs to unwind to trap music on occasion. That is of course, unless you can bounce it up and down like a trampoline to Andra Day, which I\u2019m pretty sure is not a thing.\n\nHe does get a little elitist with this \u201cwhat we got degrees for unless we travel overseas for?\u201d which feeds right into the whole bougie negro \u201cmust have passport\u201d mantra, but you know, different strokes for different folks. I feel like this song sounds like it has popular potential but ignant niggas don\u2019t like hearing about passports, wedding rings, and reverends in the midst of drug talk. It reminds me a bit of Janelle Monae\u2019s \u201cYoga,\u201d a song that sounded like it would kill the club except nobody wants to hear a song about yoga at 2am while Ciroc is being poured down their throat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. This may sound blasphemous, but Jidenna\u2019s singing voice is LIGHTLY reminiscent of Sam Cooke. I\u2019m NOT SAYING HE SOUNDS LIKE SAME COOKE. I\u2019m just saying on songs like \u201cBambi,\u201d where he\u2019s singing, he kind of sounds like Sam Cooke and shit. Look, don\u2019t be coming at me on some \u201cP said this nigga Jidenna sounds like Sam Cooke.\u201d I did not. I\u2019m just saying I thought of Sam Cooke when he was singing about lions and shit. And no, \u201cBambi\u201d is not about the Blackest Disney character of all time. Yes, Bambi\u2019s shit was more Black than Simba. Real shit, Disney\u2019s Bambi is really the 1942, animated version of Save The Last Dance starring Julia Stiles if she were a Black boy. I hear you looking at me right now, but trust me, it will make sense eventually. Thank me later.\n\nThat took such a left turn.\n\n6. \u201cChief Don\u2019t Run\u201d is a dope an intro song as you\u2019re going to get. No, it\u2019s not \u201cNo Limit Soldiers\u201d or \u201cWhat Up, Gangsta,\u201d but its triumphant and has the right open up your album feel. You will probably like this song.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. \u201cWhite N****s\u201d is probably the most brilliant song I\u2019ve heard in years. Premise? Jidenna turns the tables on white folks with some, \u201chey white folks, welcome to being Black\u2026here\u2019s what it looks like.\u201d Also, there\u2019s nothing more hilarious than singing \u201cwhite niggaaaaaaaaaaaaaas\u201d over and over again. The way he says \u201cwhite bitchesssssssssssss\u201d on this song also is very telling. It has emotion behind it. Trust me, I\u2019m a blogger.\n\n8. \u201cWhite N****s\u201d again. Look, if you want to know how smart and creative an artist is, you have to see how they flip old tropes and make them fresh. He managed to do that on this song. We always talk about what life would look like if white people had to face what we do. But we usually do it by putting them in the hood. He keeps white folks in the \u2018burbs and attacks their red wine, golf clubs, dogs, and lacrosse.\n\nThis song is basically the song version of Jack Briggance's (Matthew McConaughey) closing arguments in A Time To Kill where Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson) tells him to be white and shit so he goes in there and white people\u2019s it up by having the jury picture a heinous rape happening to a little girl\u2026then Sixth Sensing that shit by telling the jury to imagine that she\u2019s white and the whole jury is like NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Not a white child!!!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLe sigh. I get mad thinking about that all over again.\n\n9. Again, I\u2019m not even sure how good I think the album is yet, but I know I\u2019m impressed and surprised by his depth and how diverse it is in thought and execution. That alone is worth at least a listen.

They wouldn\u2019t do it after Gabby Giffords was shot. They wouldn\u2019t even do it after Sandy Hook. Maybe there is no one who can break the toxic romance that America has with guns ...\n\nI bet black people could.\n\nYou know we have to do all the hard shit. We picked all the cotton. We created every iota of American music, dance and culture. We made this country an economic superpower. We fight disproportionately in every war. A black man gave this country universal health care. We invented the modern air conditioner. If it wasn\u2019t for black people, this country would still consist of poor, backward hillbillies ballroom-dancing to Appalachian bluegrass tunes and sweating their asses off while coughing up phlegm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019re welcome, white people.\n\nSince we have to do everything around here, I guess I\u2019ll get up tomorrow and solve this whole gun issue. Here\u2019s how I plan to do it.\n\n1. Get lots of black people to buy guns.\n\nI know it seems antithetical, but if black people started purchasing semi-automatic weapons legally and in large numbers, congressional Republicans would pass a gun-owner safety bill faster than white people\u2019s fucking tempo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t even have to actually purchase guns\u2014all we\u2019d have to do is get black people to join the National Rifle Association en masse. We could just make all strip clubs free before midnight with an NRA membership card. I already came up with a slogan:\n\nThe National Rifle Association: Make dat ass and your guns clap! (OK, I admit it needs work.)\n\nI bet if Jay-Z gave away a free subscription to the NRA with his next album, we could stage a takeover (see what I did there?).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI mean, it\u2019s gotta be worth more than a subscription to Tidal, right?\n\n2. Call gun ownership a form of resistance.\n\nWe need to figure out a way to make the GOP believe that buying guns is a form of protest, because whether it\u2019s black fists at the Olympics, sitting in an empty bus seat, walking across a bridge, sitting down at a lunch counter, marching, kneeling or even saying the words \u201cBlack lives matter,\u201d white America has never approved of any form of black protest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoes anyone have Colin Kaepernick\u2019s number?\n\n3. Make it cool.\n\nIf black people made mandatory waiting periods or universal background checks cool, white people would appropriate it like they did jazz, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, hip-hop, our dances, our style, our vernacular and everything except our poultry-seasoning techniques.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we could get Rihanna to Snapchat herself calling a congressman, you know Kim Kardashian would be on Instagram tomorrow dialing up a senator while wearing a thong and pasties. Then Kendall Jenner would make a commercial featuring her interrupting a class to hand a Mr. Pibb to a white boy in a trench coat about to go on a school shooting spree, thereby saving the day. (For some reason, Pepsi passed on the idea.)\n\nThen Taylor Swift could make a song called \u201cControl My Love\u201d about how her body is a gun that needs controlling before she explodes. I know that\u2019s a shitty, unfunny analogy ...\n\nWhich is exactly why it will be a No. 1 hit for Taylor Swift.\n\n4. We might have to threaten the animals.\n\nThe only thing white people love more than their guns is their pets. They could give a fraction of a fuck about actual human lives, but they will jump in front of a speeding train for a puppy. You literally have to fill out more paperwork to buy a Yorkshire terrier from a pet store than you do to purchase an AK-47 from a gun show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s some kind of statistic about how many pets are killed by gunfire every year. Instead of talking about human deaths, we need to focus on pets.\n\nWe need to make one of those sad \u201cArms of an Angel\u201d commercials showing puppies shot* by people who didn\u2019t undergo the mandatory background checks (don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s all makeup and CGI), but you know white America would go into hysterics if we showed a puppy being harmed.\n\n\n\nBlack boys, not so much.\n\n*No animals were harmed in the writing of this article.\n\n5. Lie.\n\nI\u2019ve learned that troglodyte, middle-American conservatives will believe anything if you say it loud enough and frequently enough. Somehow, fake facts seep into their porous brains, no matter how ridiculous it sounds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps we could pay Rush Limbaugh and Bill O\u2019Reilly to join our cause. Those bastards would do anything for money. They could tell their followers there is a little-known clause in Obamacare that allows people to trade abortions for banana clips. Maybe we could fool those idiots into putting their guns down by playing on their racism and fear of black dicks. We could just mention that there was a recent study that shows gunpowder makes white women prefer black penis, or tell them that every time someone uses the gun-show loophole, a black penis grows an inch.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be that hard to bamboozle a group of people who believe that Fox News is \u201cfair and balanced\u201d; climate change is a hoax; an international pedophile ring operates out of a basement under a Washington, D.C., pizza shop; universal health care is bad; or a low-IQ, repeatedly bankrupt, billionaire trust fund bullshit artist with a toupee made out of golden retriever hair and dryer lint would rescue poor, white hillbillies from poverty.\n\nYou\u2019re welcome, white people.\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.", "keywords": ["form", "ways", "black", "universal", "force", "gun", "control", "white", "know", "guns", "commonsense", "welcome", "wouldnt", "need"], "polarity": 0.042075163398692786, "subjectivity": 0.4215896358543419},

Maxine Waters: Breaker of Chains, Reclaimer of Time\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter having to suffer the devastating dishonor of having an orange buffoon in the White House, black people have pretty much been fed up since before 2017. And no person illustrated this \u201cfed-uppedness\u201d more than longtime career politician Rep. Maxine Waters.\n\n\n\nMadame Waters (D-Calif.) was, quite frankly, the mood of 2017. From her hilarious and biting tweets to her determination to see Donald Trump impeached, she simply had no fucks to give. And the greatest example of this was when her legitimate question about 45\u2019s financial ties to Russia was interrupted by wayward Caucasian American Steven Mnuchin. The deflection did not deter her and she instead repeated \u201cReclaiming my time\u201d over and over again until he eventually shut the fuck up.\n\nShe\u2019s a boss. You know it. I know it. And 2017 knew it.\n\n2. Michelle Obama and the Side Eye Seen\u2019t Around the World\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch despair was felt through the force when it was announced that Agent Orange was gonna waltz his baked-Cheeto, dusty ass into the White House. And while that was bad enough, most of us couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how little time we had left to spend with the Obamas. So imagine our surprise when Michelle Obama gifted us with enough side eye during Inauguration Day to help us power through the rest of 2017.\n\nYes, before she would walk into the sunset with her beloved Barack and say goodbye to us forever, our good sis Michelle gave the best side eye ever after getting a gift from Melania and listening to all the Inauguration Day malarkey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was her final act as first lady. And what an act it was.\n\n3. Anika Noni Rose Lovingly Encouraging Cicely Tyson at the Emmys\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have a love-hate relationship with the Emmys, mostly based on how Caucasian the nomination lineups are for the night. However, I luckily caught a few moments from the 2017 Emmys. And I\u2019m glad I did because had I not, I would have missed one of the greatest moments in Black Girl Magic history.\n\n\n\nThe moment includes both Anika Noni Rose and Cicely Tyson going up to announce the winner for Outstanding Limited Series. The immortal Tyson paused right before recalling her role in Roots, and instead of awkwardly standing there until Tyson remembered, Rose leaned over and whispered an encouragement in Tyson\u2019s ears.\n\n\n\nIt was one of the simplest yet greatest acts of black sisterhood and solidarity that I had seen in a while. And in a year that was as brutal as 2017, it was sorely needed.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. World Stop: Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Pregnancy Announcement\n\nGreatness begets greatness. I don\u2019t know who said that, and I don\u2019t care to ask, but just know that it has been and always will be applied to Her Majesty King Beyonc\u00e9, First and Only of Her Name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter having a fantastic year in 2016, Beyonc\u00e9 blew our black minds when she surprise-announced her pregnancy on Instagram with the radiance and grace of a black Madonna. And while gracing us with her otherworldliness, she managed to piss off white women and white conservatives and inspire low-budget Great Value copycats in one wild swoop.\n\nNever change, Bey. Never change.\n\n5. Black Twitter Gathering Kendall Jenner\u2019s Edges Over That Pepsi Commercial\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlenty of black folx had a fantastic year. Cardi B had a fantastic year. Issa Rae had a phenomenal year. Rihanna had a spectacular year. New Edition had an amazing year. And Tiffany Haddish had an astounding year.\n\n\n\nThe list of black people laughing in the face of 2017 is very long. But such a list would be incomplete without the collective that is Black Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Twitter has been a respected entity for a while now. But it truly cemented itself as a cultural force for change when it single-handedly got Kendall Jenner\u2019s tone-deaf-ass Pepsi commercial yoinked from the TV airwaves. Indeed, Jenner thought she was doing all of us a favor by throwing some dusty Party City wig at a fellow sista in the commercial (an apt self-dragging of white feminism) before hijacking black and brown traditions of protest, and Black Twitter, of course, said, \u201cNot today, Satan.\u201d\n\n\n\nCombine this with other cultural moments like spurring on (along with Black Tumblr) Netflix to make that Rihanna-Lupita Nyong\u2019o Heist movie, penned by Issa Rae and directed by Ava DuVernay, a reality and exposing the hell out of Keaton Jones\u2019 white supremacist family, and it is very clear that Black Twitter is here to stay and suffers no fools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Black Women in Alabama Telling Roy Moore, \u201cYou Thought!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou probably notice how I keep mentioning that 2017 was a tough-ass year. This is most certainly true, especially politically.\n\nSince the Over-Inflated Tangerine was voted into office by white women, it\u2019s been a yearlong battle to make sure that our legislators, quite frankly, do not kill us. This has been true concerning the Affordable Care Act, the GOP tax plan, net neutrality and so much more. So you can say, politically, we really needed a win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd black women gave us exactly that in the election battle between Roy Moore and Doug Jones for a U.S. Senate seat representing Alabama.\n\nThe choice was between an accused child-molesting, homophobic bigot and a Democrat, Doug Jones, and white people almost purposely screwed the pooch again by voting in the alleged child molester because he was \u201ccloser to God\u201d (cue an eye roll). Of course, black women did not allow this to pass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a nod to the 94 percent who showed us they had common sense during the general election, and it proved that, yes, even states like Alabama (where black people live, too, Bernie Sanders) can have competitive elections if given the fucking chance.\n\nBlack women, I salute you. Truly.\n\n7. It Ain\u2019t Over Till It\u2019s Over: Moonlight\n\nIn that same vein, 2017 must have been the year of \u201cHold up, wait a minute,\u201d because not only did black people pull off the upset in Alabama this year, but we managed to pull it off during Oscar season, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this year, La La Land was heavily projected to win the Oscar for Best Picture over Moonlight, and despite all the queer black people everywhere giving Goku our energy for a spirit bomb, it looked like La La Land would indeed win. And that much was confirmed when B(La)h B(La)h Land was crowned winner.\n\nThat is ... until it was un-crowned.\n\nIn one of the most confusing moments of 2017, La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz snatched the card from the dazed and confused presenter and clarified that it was Moonlight that had actually won Best Picture. I\u2019m always gonna wonder who I need to drag for low-key stealing Moonlight\u2019s moment, but this should be a lesson to us as a people that it is not over until we say it\u2019s over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Colin Kaepernick Has the Last Laugh\n\nColin Kaepernick\u2019s long, hard-fought battle to call out police brutality and systemic injustice started out in 2016 when he, a San Francisco 49ers quarterback at the time, sat down during the playing of the national anthem at a preseason game versus the Green Bay Packers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, the football player and activist has been the center of an intense, national debate on racial and social injustice, and because he continued to walk and talk the talk, the powers that be decided that Kaepernick would enter the year as an unsigned free agent, despite being more talented than plenty of other current quarterbacks (*stares at Jay Cutler*).\n\n\n\nAnd these racist NFL owners probably had a good chuckle over it all ... until it was announced that Kaepernick was suing the shit out of all of them, of course.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only did Kaepernick decide to bring a case against them, but he also went on to become GQ\u2019s Citizen of the Year, and he\u2019s currently mulling over the prospect of maybe owning the Carolina Panthers alongside Diddy and Steph Curry.\n\nClearly, Kaepernick is just getting started.\n\n9. Black People Do Do Horror: On Get Out Being a Success\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn times of trial and tribulation, black art has risen like a phoenix and thrived in the face of uncertainty, and Get Out was certainly not an exception this year.\n\n\n\nJordan Peele\u2019s directorial debut and smash hit changed the game forever this year.\n\nNot only did it make bank with a film budget that sounded like the movie-producing equivalent of $3, but its biting social commentary on racial relations in America presented in the horror genre reminded us of how multifaceted black people are and how it\u2019s about damn time that black creatives get to flex our muscles in genre movies (another great example of this is Dee Rees\u2019 Mudbound, which no doubt counts as a Western/period piece).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd not even the Golden Globes\u2019 outdated genre system can take this win away from us.\n\n10. LeBron James Calling Donald Trump by His Name: \u201cBum\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the year when white people continued to show their asses and black people made a conscious and collective decision to stop giving a singular fuck, no such person illustrated this big mood quite like LeBron R. James.\n\nJames, a three-time NBA champ, has proved time and time again that he doesn\u2019t concern himself with the opinions of sheep, but he took this attitude to the next level when the Expired Squash got in his Twitter feelings about Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors\u2019 declining his booty-ass invite to visit the White (Supremacist) House.\n\nTrump was about five more seconds from going full Mean Girls on Curry (which included uninviting them) when James became sick of the bullshit and fired off the tweet heard around the world:\n\nHe called 45 a \u201cbum.\u201d\n\nThe legendary tweet is still on James\u2019 Twitter page. To this day. And I am hoping that it continues to serve as a visible reminder that black people from all walks of life are never too busy to speak truth to power and call a spade a spade. All while having a good and necessary laugh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s that on that.", "keywords": ["black", "2017", "white", "twitter", "kaepernick", "la", "land", "tyson", "moments", "women", "won"], "polarity": 0.10843534659042689, "subjectivity": 0.4960628438703303},

And while gracing us with her otherworldliness, she managed to piss off white women and white conservatives and inspire low-budget Great Value copycats in one wild swoop.\n\nNever change, Bey. Never change.\n\n5. Black Twitter Gathering Kendall Jenner\u2019s Edges Over That Pepsi Commercial\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlenty of black folx had a fantastic year. Cardi B had a fantastic year. Issa Rae had a phenomenal year. Rihanna had a spectacular year. New Edition had an amazing year. And Tiffany Haddish had an astounding year.\n\n\n\nThe list of black people laughing in the face of 2017 is very long. But such a list would be incomplete without the collective that is Black Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Twitter has been a respected entity for a while now. But it truly cemented itself as a cultural force for change when it single-handedly got Kendall Jenner\u2019s tone-deaf-ass Pepsi commercial yoinked from the TV airwaves. Indeed, Jenner thought she was doing all of us a favor by throwing some dusty Party City wig at a fellow sista in the commercial (an apt self-dragging of white feminism) before hijacking black and brown traditions of protest, and Black Twitter, of course, said, \u201cNot today, Satan.\u201d\n\n\n\nCombine this with other cultural moments like spurring on (along with Black Tumblr) Netflix to make that Rihanna-Lupita Nyong\u2019o Heist movie, penned by Issa Rae and directed by Ava DuVernay, a reality and exposing the hell out of Keaton Jones\u2019 white supremacist family, and it is very clear that Black Twitter is here to stay and suffers no fools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Black Women in Alabama Telling Roy Moore, \u201cYou Thought!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou probably notice how I keep mentioning that 2017 was a tough-ass year. This is most certainly true, especially politically.\n\nSince the Over-Inflated Tangerine was voted into office by white women, it\u2019s been a yearlong battle to make sure that our legislators, quite frankly, do not kill us. This has been true concerning the Affordable Care Act, the GOP tax plan, net neutrality and so much more. So you can say, politically, we really needed a win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd black women gave us exactly that in the election battle between Roy Moore and Doug Jones for a U.S. Senate seat representing Alabama.\n\nThe choice was between an accused child-molesting, homophobic bigot and a Democrat, Doug Jones, and white people almost purposely screwed the pooch again by voting in the alleged child molester because he was \u201ccloser to God\u201d (cue an eye roll). Of course, black women did not allow this to pass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a nod to the 94 percent who showed us they had common sense during the general election, and it proved that, yes, even states like Alabama (where black people live, too, Bernie Sanders) can have competitive elections if given the fucking chance.\n\nBlack women, I salute you. Truly.\n\n7. It Ain\u2019t Over Till It\u2019s Over: Moonlight\n\nIn that same vein, 2017 must have been the year of \u201cHold up, wait a minute,\u201d because not only did black people pull off the upset in Alabama this year, but we managed to pull it off during Oscar season, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this year, La La Land was heavily projected to win the Oscar for Best Picture over Moonlight, and despite all the queer black people everywhere giving Goku our energy for a spirit bomb, it looked like La La Land would indeed win. And that much was confirmed when B(La)h B(La)h Land was crowned winner.\n\nThat is ... until it was un-crowned.\n\nIn one of the most confusing moments of 2017, La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz snatched the card from the dazed and confused presenter and clarified that it was Moonlight that had actually won Best Picture. I\u2019m always gonna wonder who I need to drag for low-key stealing Moonlight\u2019s moment, but this should be a lesson to us as a people that it is not over until we say it\u2019s over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Colin Kaepernick Has the Last Laugh\n\nColin Kaepernick\u2019s long, hard-fought battle to call out police brutality and systemic injustice started out in 2016 when he, a San Francisco 49ers quarterback at the time, sat down during the playing of the national anthem at a preseason game versus the Green Bay Packers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, the football player and activist has been the center of an intense, national debate on racial and social injustice, and because he continued to walk and talk the talk, the powers that be decided that Kaepernick would enter the year as an unsigned free agent, despite being more talented than plenty of other current quarterbacks (*stares at Jay Cutler*).\n\n\n\nAnd these racist NFL owners probably had a good chuckle over it all ... until it was announced that Kaepernick was suing the shit out of all of them, of course.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only did Kaepernick decide to bring a case against them, but he also went on to become GQ\u2019s Citizen of the Year, and he\u2019s currently mulling over the prospect of maybe owning the Carolina Panthers alongside Diddy and Steph Curry.\n\nClearly, Kaepernick is just getting started.\n\n9. Black People Do Do Horror: On Get Out Being a Success\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn times of trial and tribulation, black art has risen like a phoenix and thrived in the face of uncertainty, and Get Out was certainly not an exception this year.\n\n\n\nJordan Peele\u2019s directorial debut and smash hit changed the game forever this year.\n\nNot only did it make bank with a film budget that sounded like the movie-producing equivalent of $3, but its biting social commentary on racial relations in America presented in the horror genre reminded us of how multifaceted black people are and how it\u2019s about damn time that black creatives get to flex our muscles in genre movies (another great example of this is Dee Rees\u2019 Mudbound, which no doubt counts as a Western/period piece).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd not even the Golden Globes\u2019 outdated genre system can take this win away from us.\n\n10. LeBron James Calling Donald Trump by His Name: \u201cBum\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the year when white people continued to show their asses and black people made a conscious and collective decision to stop giving a singular fuck, no such person illustrated this big mood quite like LeBron R. James.\n\nJames, a three-time NBA champ, has proved time and time again that he doesn\u2019t concern himself with the opinions of sheep, but he took this attitude to the next level when the Expired Squash got in his Twitter feelings about Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors\u2019 declining his booty-ass invite to visit the White (Supremacist) House.\n\nTrump was about five more seconds from going full Mean Girls on Curry (which included uninviting them) when James became sick of the bullshit and fired off the tweet heard around the world:\n\nHe called 45 a \u201cbum.\u201d\n\nThe legendary tweet is still on James\u2019 Twitter page. To this day. And I am hoping that it continues to serve as a visible reminder that black people from all walks of life are never too busy to speak truth to power and call a spade a spade. All while having a good and necessary laugh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s that on that.", "keywords": ["black", "2017", "white", "twitter", "kaepernick", "la", "land", "tyson", "moments", "women", "won"], "polarity": 0.10843534659042689, "subjectivity": 0.4960628438703303},

These people and several hundred others were allegedly shot by 64-year-old Stephen Paddock as he took position on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel and fired thousands of rounds down on concertgoers during a Jason Aldean show.\n\n\n\nToday, as well as in the coming days and weeks, the conversation will turn to the role that the availability of high-powered weapons has on America\u2019s unique predilection for mass shootings. Just this afternoon, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the president\u2019s primary propagandist and agent of misinformation, declared today to be too soon to talk gun control before pivoting, midbreath, to blow a Chicago dog whistle. There have been and will continue to be very passionate rebukes of Sanders and Donald Trump and the National Rifle Association and white maleness, and very smart people will offer possible solutions to this unsolvable problem.\n\nAnd then, when another mass shooting happens next month or next year or tomorrow in Austin, Texas, or Youngstown, Ohio, or Durham, N.C., or Denver, the same thing will happen again. Nothing will change.\n\nIt\u2019s with this context that I\u2019m left to wonder exactly how many white people would have to die in a mass shooting before America\u2019s collective will to stop this from happening again would surpass its zeal and yearning for guns. Which number would serve as the critical mass?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe know, after Sandy Hook, that the deaths of 20 young schoolchildren weren\u2019t enough. And if the senseless murder of children affects us, I don\u2019t know, 10 times as much as the murders of adults do, then we can extrapolate and presume that 200 people murdered in a mass shooting wouldn\u2019t be enough, either.\n\n\n\nAlso, it\u2019s no accident that the headline of this piece includes a qualifier for whiteness. It\u2019s there because we know exactly how many black people would have to die in a mass shooting before America decided to give a shit about gun control. If there are roughly 40 million black people here, then roughly 40 million black people would have to die. Then, of course, the NRA\u2019s need to be a source of white identification\u2014and the aggressively white affinity to possess the ability to stockpile killing machines\u2014would no longer exist. No need for night-lights if all the bogeymen are dead.\n\n\n\nSo anyway, what is the number? 250? 500? 600? 1,300? 2,200? 57,000?

It was the year a Democrat won a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama. It was the year an alleged pedophile was endorsed by the most powerful man in the free world.\n\nLooking back on the year, no one work sums up the horrors and polarities of the year more than Get Out. It was undoubtedly the movie of 2017: a genre-bending film that managed to feel both timely and overdue. But what makes it not just the film of 2017, but emblematic of it, is best captured in audiences\u2019 divergent reactions to it.\n\nIn a recent interview with Seth Meyers on his late-night show, Allison Williams, who plays the film\u2019s surprise villain, Rose Armitage, describes the reaction she received from white people who had trouble believing that her character, a woman who preyed upon black people, was actually evil:\n\nThey\u2019d say, \u201cShe was hypnotized, right?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cNo! She\u2019s just evil!\u201d How hard is that to accept? She\u2019s bad! We gave you so many ways to know that she\u2019s bad! She has photos of people whose lives she ended behind her! The minute she can, she hangs them back up on the wall behind her. That\u2019s so crazy! And they\u2019re still like, \u201cBut maybe she\u2019s also a victim?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cNO! No!\u201d And I will say, that is one-hundred percent white people who say that to me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe anecdote has stuck with me for weeks. It stuck with me as I watched the New York Times\u2019 election needle tremble back and forth during Alabama\u2019s special election, in which an alleged pedophile, Roy Moore, was nearly sent to the U.S. Senate. It dug in when I saw a statistic that echoed to a similar one regarding Donald Trump voters from November of last year: Sixty-three percent of white women voted for Moore. And when pundits began their near-instant erasure of that fact, Williams\u2019 anecdote, relayed with wide-eyed disbelief by the actress, rose up like detritus stirred up by a current.\n\nThe truly radical thing about Get Out, the horror it captures with precision and clarity, is less about the violence white people can and have exacted on black bodies. What\u2019s truly terrifying about the film, about Rose\u2019s character, is the assumption of white innocence\u2014an innocence that is reflected in white audiences\u2019 insistent belief that Rose is, deep down, good. Chris, the film\u2019s main character, is just as guilty of this as the white audience that approaches Williams. It\u2019s as if the delusion of innocence is itself a kind of hypnosis, even as the evidence of villainy is literally written on the wall (\u201cShe has photos of people whose lives she ended behind her\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2017, I learned that the fulcrum of white supremacy isn\u2019t violence, as I had always thought. It was virtue.\n\nI understand that, to many, this isn\u2019t a particularly new or bold revelation, but I had gotten used to thinking of white supremacy in terms of violence: of physical violence, but also emotional trauma, the plunder of one\u2019s body as well as one\u2019s mind and one\u2019s wealth. It wasn\u2019t until talking to Joe Feagin, a professor at Texas A&M University who is credited with coining the term \u201csystemic racism,\u201d that I was introduced to the concept of white virtue\u2014and how it was the axis on which white supremacy turns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his theory of the \u201cwhite racial frame\u201d\u2014a pro-white worldview that many white and nonwhite people aren\u2019t consciously aware they\u2019ve absorbed\u2014whiteness is seen as inherently good.\n\n\u201cWe whites are trained into seeing ourselves as virtuous. We have the most virtuous history. We have the most advanced civilization,\u201d Feagin explained. \u201cWe speak the best-quality English. We have the best beauty images, especially for women. All of those things ... civilization, history, values, religion, virtues, work ethic.\u201d\n\nAnd, Feagin adds, it\u2019s the hardest element of socialized racism for white people to dismantle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was hard for me, a biracial Filipina, to wrap my head around this at first. Aren\u2019t all people, all tribes, convinced of their goodness? Doesn\u2019t that need for self-preservation, to guard the image of yourself as virtuous, sit deep within everyone?\n\nWe can\u2019t count the number of black and brown lives this country has plundered and broken in the name of white virtue: to preserve white neighborhoods and white voting booths, to keep women and bloodlines \u201cpure\u201d and politics \u201cclean.\u201d\n\nBut the difference is one of scale and cost: This nation codified the value of whiteness into its earliest laws: laying out who exactly was and wasn\u2019t white. Detailing and revising exactly what that whiteness earned you. Whiteness (along with maleness, along with money) was a virtue. And from those who did not meet its qualifications, this country extracted a steep price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe evidence of this inclination to insist on white virtue is everywhere. There\u2019s the obvious: the white supremacists and white nationalists who refuse to cede any political or cultural ground to people of color; the neo-Nazis and the Holocaust deniers. Fringe groups who assumed center stage in American discourse in 2017.\n\nBut it\u2019s evident in smaller offenses. Rhetorically, it\u2019s in the way Ryan Lochte, a 33-year-old Olympic swimmer, can be called a \u201cboy\u201d when he engages in criminal behavior. It\u2019s evident in the way white people\u2019s racist performances\u2014the nigger jokes, the blackface\u2014can be excused as \u201cjust jokes.\u201d It\u2019s the ease with which white people (and lots of nonblack people) can slip into caricatures of African Americans that paint them as lazy, incompetent or immoral. It\u2019s evident in the quick and ready defenses some white people provide when faced with uncomfortable conversations about systemic racism: Yeah, but I had nothing to do with that. That was a long time ago. It\u2019s not like I owned slaves. I wasn\u2019t there.\n\n\n\nThis, despite the fact that we can\u2019t count the number of black and brown lives this country has plundered and broken in the name of white virtue: to preserve white neighborhoods and white voting booths, to keep women and bloodlines \u201cpure\u201d and politics \u201cclean.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA comfortable delusion. A self-serving hypnosis. An insistence on innocence that delays a reckoning.\n\nI\u2019m not shocked that there are white audiences who see Rose and still insist on seeing a victim, on drawing some strand of virtue from a character who is clearly aware of what she is doing and delights in it. If we consider white virtue to be the fulcrum of white supremacy, nobody symbolizes this virtue more than white women.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this way, you see Rose everywhere.\n\nYou see it when Betsy DeVos is looked at as an incompetent stooge rather than an active, knowledgeable participant in dismantling our public education system. You see it in the false feminism and performative innocence of Ivanka Trump, a woman credited with helping push the GOP\u2019s tax bill\u2014an enormous wealth transfer for the rich\u2014through Congress. You see it in the silence of white Hollywood when their black peers are attacked or exploited (this pattern, of course, extends to other industries). In 2017, Rose was just as likely to wear a pussy hat as a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d shirt.\n\nThe cruelty that extends the cut? Even as we\u2019re surrounded by the evidence of Rose\u2019s crimes (look no further than the White House), many are reluctant to reckon with the woman in the mirror. To part with their innocence.

All of those things ... civilization, history, values, religion, virtues, work ethic.\u201d\n\nAnd, Feagin adds, it\u2019s the hardest element of socialized racism for white people to dismantle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was hard for me, a biracial Filipina, to wrap my head around this at first. Aren\u2019t all people, all tribes, convinced of their goodness? Doesn\u2019t that need for self-preservation, to guard the image of yourself as virtuous, sit deep within everyone?\n\nWe can\u2019t count the number of black and brown lives this country has plundered and broken in the name of white virtue: to preserve white neighborhoods and white voting booths, to keep women and bloodlines \u201cpure\u201d and politics \u201cclean.\u201d\n\nBut the difference is one of scale and cost: This nation codified the value of whiteness into its earliest laws: laying out who exactly was and wasn\u2019t white. Detailing and revising exactly what that whiteness earned you. Whiteness (along with maleness, along with money) was a virtue. And from those who did not meet its qualifications, this country extracted a steep price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe evidence of this inclination to insist on white virtue is everywhere. There\u2019s the obvious: the white supremacists and white nationalists who refuse to cede any political or cultural ground to people of color; the neo-Nazis and the Holocaust deniers. Fringe groups who assumed center stage in American discourse in 2017.\n\nBut it\u2019s evident in smaller offenses. Rhetorically, it\u2019s in the way Ryan Lochte, a 33-year-old Olympic swimmer, can be called a \u201cboy\u201d when he engages in criminal behavior. It\u2019s evident in the way white people\u2019s racist performances\u2014the nigger jokes, the blackface\u2014can be excused as \u201cjust jokes.\u201d It\u2019s the ease with which white people (and lots of nonblack people) can slip into caricatures of African Americans that paint them as lazy, incompetent or immoral. It\u2019s evident in the quick and ready defenses some white people provide when faced with uncomfortable conversations about systemic racism: Yeah, but I had nothing to do with that. That was a long time ago. It\u2019s not like I owned slaves. I wasn\u2019t there.\n\n\n\nThis, despite the fact that we can\u2019t count the number of black and brown lives this country has plundered and broken in the name of white virtue: to preserve white neighborhoods and white voting booths, to keep women and bloodlines \u201cpure\u201d and politics \u201cclean.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA comfortable delusion. A self-serving hypnosis. An insistence on innocence that delays a reckoning.\n\nI\u2019m not shocked that there are white audiences who see Rose and still insist on seeing a victim, on drawing some strand of virtue from a character who is clearly aware of what she is doing and delights in it. If we consider white virtue to be the fulcrum of white supremacy, nobody symbolizes this virtue more than white women.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this way, you see Rose everywhere.\n\nYou see it when Betsy DeVos is looked at as an incompetent stooge rather than an active, knowledgeable participant in dismantling our public education system. You see it in the false feminism and performative innocence of Ivanka Trump, a woman credited with helping push the GOP\u2019s tax bill\u2014an enormous wealth transfer for the rich\u2014through Congress. You see it in the silence of white Hollywood when their black peers are attacked or exploited (this pattern, of course, extends to other industries). In 2017, Rose was just as likely to wear a pussy hat as a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d shirt.\n\nThe cruelty that extends the cut? Even as we\u2019re surrounded by the evidence of Rose\u2019s crimes (look no further than the White House), many are reluctant to reckon with the woman in the mirror. To part with their innocence.

What?! This is the true story of Margot Lee Shetterly. She is the black woman who helped bring Hidden Figures to life.\n\nHidden Figures is the amazing but previously untold story of three black female mathematicians\u2014Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson and Dorothy Vaughan; their contributions to NASA; and pretty much their role in helping shape America's history in space exploration.\n\nThis story is not only a surefire box-office smash but also a book that was written as the movie was being produced. Shetterly is now a New York Times best-selling author, and Hidden Figures is also the No. 1 young readers book. Shetterly wondered, as we all did, how does that happen on your first book? She and I chatted on the phone, mostly gushing over her seemingly overnight success. \"It\u2019s a lightning strike \u2026 fairy dust,\" she said.\n\n\"I wrote the book I wanted to read,\" she added. \"I wanted those kinds of women protagonists\u2014strong, smart, successful, and [I wanted] to show the challenges they faced. I wanted it big and American.\"\n\nShetterly also wanted the world to see that black people are as much a part of American history as anyone. \"I didn\u2019t know how badly other people wanted it, not just black women.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd what a revelation!\n\nBefore the book was even finished, Hidden Figures producer Donna Gigliotti put it in the hands of Hollywood heavyweights and told Shetterly, \"We're going to make \u2026 a movie out of your book proposal.\" Within three years, both the book and the movie were finished.\n\nAnd now Shetterly has gone from an unknown writer to a best-seller who not only gets to be in the same room as first lady Michelle Obama but also gets to be praised by her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what's next? How do you move up from this height as an author? Shetterly is already working on her next book, which is part of the trilogy that Hidden Figures kicks off. Can we say \u201cYay!\u201d about more black history being revealed?\n\nShetterly is obsessed with midcentury stories and wants to continue telling them. She tells me, \"The new story [I'm working on] is also unseen, but not quite untold. It deals with midcentury. Anything I will ever do in life will not be as consuming and overwhelming as Hidden Figures.\"\n\nShe's modest, which is understandable, because not everyone gets this type of love with a first book, but success can be fleeting. I'm sure, though, that Shetterly will continue to see major success so long as she's writing our stories with such care and honesty. I'm looking forward to her continued success and am just glad I get to help tell her story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWatch the interview with Shetterly:\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["hidden", "history", "success", "black", "shetterlys", "wanted", "movie", "lee", "figures", "blackgirlmagic", "shetterly", "proves", "knows", "book", "margot", "limits", "im"], "polarity": 0.09996526107637219, "subjectivity": 0.4270936882047993},

A national survey commissioned by the Globe this fall found that among eight major cities, black people ranked Boston as least welcoming to people of color. More than half \u2014 54 percent \u2014 rated Boston as unwelcoming.\n\n\u201cLittle wonder that some comedians and athletes take aim at Boston, like Michael Che of \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 this year telling a global TV audience this was \u2018the most racist city I\u2019ve ever been to.\u2019 Or HBO\u2019s John Oliver suggesting that it took this summer\u2019s anti-bigotry march on Boston Common to finally make Boston \u2018unracist.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe reputation is real, and pervasive \u2014 but, most important, is it deserved?\n\n\u201cThe Globe Spotlight Team analyzed data, launched surveys, and conducted hundreds of interviews, to answer just that question. Spotlight examined the core of Boston\u2019s identity: our renowned colleges and world-class medical institutions; the growth that keeps expanding our skyline; business and politics; and our championship sports teams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd the Spotlight reporters, to get a sense of how much black residents are part of the mainstream of the city, did something decidedly old-school: They visited a number of iconic Boston places and simply counted the number of black people they saw.\n\n\u201cAll told, the findings were troubling. The reasons are complex.\n\n\u201cBut this much we know: Here in Boston, a city known as a liberal bastion, we have deluded ourselves into believing we\u2019ve made more progress than we have.

It was once run by veteran journalist George E. Curry, who died in 2016. Leavell said that had Curry still been there, NNPA would have had the story. Similarly, Ofield Dukes, a well-connected D.C. figure who ran a public relations firm in Washington for more than 40 years, died in 2011.

Henry has been meeting internally with women at the newspaper to discuss workplace culture, as part of the unfolding national discourse on sexual harassment, a movement often referred to by the hashtag #MeToo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn a number of informal interviews over the past two weeks for this story, women at the Globe had overall positive things to say about the current work culture in the news department where three of the top five jobs are held by women, and 22 of the 44 managers are women. Some have worked here for years and said they had never seen anything that would constitute harassment. Henry said different departments at the Globe seem to have their own cultures, and she was convinced the newsroom climate is \u2018not one of sexual harassment or sexism.\u2019\n\n\u201cStill, some women in the newsroom said they have current questions about equality of opportunity, have experienced annoying incidents of \u2018mansplaining,\u2019 or have been talked over by men in meetings.

Was it awkward, exhilarating, overwhelming, tender, traumatic\u2014or some combination of all of the above?\n\nMine was all of those things. I was a high schooler in suburban Chicago, in the throes of my first\u2014and at that age, what I believed would be my last\u2014love. Even today, I can sincerely say that it was true\u2014if young\u2014love; and in true Romeo and Juliet fashion, I threw my inexperienced self headlong into it ...\n\nAt least, until my mother found out.\n\nTo say that my mother didn\u2019t take the loss of my virginity well would be putting it mildly. While she\u2019d educated me about sexuality and sexual health since I was 6 years old, I discovered my own sexuality earlier than either of us had planned\u2014if you can plan such a thing. I may have been in love, but for my mother and me, that revelation was mutually traumatic. I was mortified and scared; she was angry, disappointed, and\u2014as I\u2019d come to understand years later\u2014terrified by the thought that I might have compromised myself and my future so early in life.\n\nWhile we often prepare our children for the mechanics and risks of sexuality, we often leave them to figure out the workings of love on their own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo there was something instantly recognizable about last Wednesday\u2019s episode of Grown-ish, in which protagonist Zoey Johnson and mom Rainbow (in a guest appearance by her Black-ish mom, Tracee Ellis Ross) found themselves in much the same situation. In a brief but poignant scene, Zoey revealed to her mother that she\u2019d fallen in love\u2014and had sex for the first time. \u201cAre you mad?\u201d she asked. In the pregnant pause that followed (pun intended), I cringed along with her as she awaited her mother\u2019s response:\n\n\u201cNo! I\u2014I just don\u2019t want to think about it ... but did you use protection? ... It was bound to happen at some point,\u201d Rainbow sputtered.\n\n\n\nIt was a refreshing moment\u2014and a departure from the usual conversations that occur around black girls and sexuality, in which we are generally divorced from our own innocence and vulnerability. The truth is, we\u2019re rarely presumed to be in love (or given the space to be), or exercising decision-making based on sexual autonomy and emotional intimacy\u2014let alone smart enough to protect ourselves. Instead, we\u2019re generally cast as over-sexualized and often \u201casking for it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Zoey\u2019s being of college age was likely another key factor in how this scenario played out, even as a fictional mother (and doctor), Rainbow understood that sexuality was a natural part of her daughter\u2019s maturation. She also seemed to understand that that development wasn\u2019t destined to happen on her time. Her primary concerns\u2014aside from her child\u2019s physical safety\u2014were not for her daughter\u2019s \u201cpurity,\u201d but for the larger implications of her making what could be a lifelong commitment at such a young age; in this case, to leave college with a potentially NBA-bound boyfriend.\n\n\u201cZoey, I did not raise you like this,\u201d Rainbow ranted. \u201cYou\u2019re a woman who\u2019s just going to throw it all away for some guy? You worked so hard to get here!\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s where the writers\u2019 room at Grown-ish really got it right this episode. Because instead of focusing on the loss of virginity (which didn\u2019t even merit its own scene), the focus was rightly placed on what it means for a black girl to commit herself to someone\u2014in mind and body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the discussion I wish my mother and I had had all those years ago. I wish she\u2019d trusted that she\u2019d taught me well on how to conduct myself physically, and focused on the emotional implications of my choice. Because while we often prepare our children for the mechanics and risks of sexuality, we often leave them to figure out the workings of love on their own.\n\nAs I\u2019ve since discussed with my mother, rarely does anyone tell young women what it\u2019ll be like when you first fall for someone\u2014and they, in turn, fall for you. Rarely does anyone tell you how overwhelming that will be, and how you\u2019ll do anything to hold on to that feeling. Beyond discussing sexual health\u2014and, now, rape culture\u2014rarely are we preparing our daughters to trust themselves emotionally, and to take their own agency sexually.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m personally grateful that a show like Grown-ish exists for this generation. Because as a member of several older generations of folks who often seem to lack the emotional intelligence to have productive, mutually respectful relationships, I think that maybe these are the conversations we need to be having.", "keywords": ["weeks", "sexual", "right", "daughters", "mothers", "shed", "grownish", "rarely", "leave", "emotional", "talk", "rainbow", "sexuality", "love", "mother"], "polarity": 0.15486830357142856, "subjectivity": 0.5726875},

John Lewis (D-Ga.) and other Democrats went back to Congress to figure out what to do next on gun control. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said that afternoon that he wasn\u2019t going to reward Democrats for their civil obedience.\n\nHonestly, when Lewis, the last survivor from the 1963 March on Washington\u2019s speakers platform, led that 26-hour sit-in on the House floor, I was intrigued and excited, but as the day went on, it did breeze through my mind that the old man was losing it. Why would this civil rights leader-turned-liberal lion use his hard-won movement cred for the one-gazillionth time in this semiorganized way?\n\nThis protest seemed as ad hoc as some sort of activist space cruiser left adrift without hyper drive. Ryan, part of a new generation of whites who've been exposed to the movement history that Lewis and others wrote in blood a half-century ago, understood that movements need open resistance to stay alive. So, although visibly annoyed, Ryan was smart enough to step out of the way: He turned off the House\u2019s lights and cameras, leaving the sit-in protesters to Periscope and Facebook. But Lewis got what he wanted: Buzzing commenced.\n\nIn retrospect, I was excited that someone had taken over the House, but I was disappointed by who. My almost quarter-century living in the Washington, D.C., area showed me, sadly, that the spirit of Che Guevara did not exactly thrive in the Congress\u2014or in corporate downtown white Washington, D.C., bougie black D.C., or now-gentrified white D.C., either. The party determined to elect Hillary Clinton this fall is in no way the hope of radical, or even substantial, social change.\n\nTearing through all three volumes of John Lewis\u2019 \u201cgraphic memoir,\u201d March (the third and final volume will be published next month), I saw that the Democratic Party really hadn\u2019t changed a bit. But I also got some clues as to the \u201cwhy\u201d of Lewis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLewis and his co-writer, Andrew Aydin, joined by artist Nate Powell, spill the bloodstained ink of a vicious history all over the more than 500 pages of the three volumes. Much of the 1955-1965 history is familiar to anyone who\u2019s seen a movement documentary or docudrama: the Freedom Rides, the Birmingham, Ala., church bombing, the Selma-to-Montgomery, Ala., march. It will come as no surprise to those who read these types of post-2010, black narrative-history books that Lewis\u2019 testimony is bookended, and fulfilled, by Barack Obama\u2019s 2009 inauguration.\n\nThe movement veteran does a great service by mentioning all of the people who were murdered on his watch who are not remembered by American history\u2019s ever-shrinking popular summary. The fact that a vibrant, courageous life can, and often did, end in a disturbing death haunts his work. Lewis and his colleagues in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee understood that they could be violently erased at any moment. They courted the Grim Reaper because they saw that risk as the only way to change the psychological and spiritual sickness of white supremacy and white indifference from the segregated outhouse to the segregated White House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat was most significant about March was its attempt not at visuals but at sound. The trio of creators want the reader to hear spitting sheriffs, marching heels, flashing camera bulbs and ringing phones. Although in black-and-white (symbolically?), the volume wants the young people of tomorrow\u2019s movements to experience both the sudden trauma and the little, quiet moments.\n\nMarch is mandatory reading for any teen or preteen, but I would strongly suggest that it be paired with Herb Boyd and Lance Tooks' contribution to the For Beginners documentary comic book series, Black Panthers for Beginners. Lewis\u2019 black Christian liberal worldview of black nationalism and Pan-Africanism, of Stokely Carmichael, of Malcolm X, needs to be supplemented and countered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn Lewis is unquestionably an African-American hero. But as a Northerner who is a strong admirer of the black power movement, especially the 50-year-old Black Panthers, I feel he\u2019s also like black America\u2019s older, slightly annoying great-uncle who still thinks platform shoes and the O\u2019Jays are cool. Does Lewis, now 76, live waaaay too much in the interracial, supposedly harmonious past of pre-black-power-movement activism (a depiction as unreal as, well, movement comic books), or does he see a future in which black-led justice will be permanently linked with other struggles? Clearly both; from his perspective, he has no choice. And movement people believe in doing, in taking substantive risks\u2014and generating armchair criticism from those not in the arena, like me.\n\nSo the Last Speaker, the doer, moves, repping (and, frankly, perhaps sometimes taking full advantage of) his painful witness with his own very moral sense of struggle and justice. What was clear about the House sit-in was this: He tried to act against a brooding evil that had spilled innocent blood once too often. When put in those terms, election-year Democratic liberal stunt or not, Lewis had no choice but to fulfill his whole self, to try to bear witness before the latest shooting victims would be added to the historical limbo of the forgotten. Whatever you think of Lewis, Capitol Hill has seen motivations far less pure.\n\nTodd Steven Burroughs, an independent researcher and writer based in Newark, N.J., is the author of Son-Shine on Cracked Sidewalks, an audiobook on Amiri Baraka and Ras Baraka through the eyes of the 2014 Newark mayoral campaign.

Many of us are just now learning their names: Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson and Dorothy Vaughn.\n\nSo much of our history has been omitted from the curricula of many schools. That's a huge chunk of the foundation of racism that our country is built on. It's the reason that the three women who are highlighted in Hidden Figures, as well as the many black women who worked right alongside them and many others, have been ignored by history. It's the reason that today, some 54 years later, we still have to proclaim that black lives matter when we see evidence right in front of our eyes that says they don't.\n\nAstronaut John Glenn's orbit around Earth in 1962 was called one of the most important flights in U.S. history, and it no doubt is. NASA even says that because of that mission, Glenn \"became a national hero and a symbol of American ambition.\" And yet there was no mention of the numbers that made the mission successful, or that the only numbers Glenn trusted were Johnson's.\n\nAt a press conference for Hidden Figures, Taraji P. Henson, who plays Johnson, said, \u201cWhen you\u2019re playing a person who\u2019s real, there\u2019s a responsibility to get it right. As soon as I signed on, I asked if she was still alive. I had to meet her immediately.\u201d Johnson and her family were delighted not only to meet the superstar but also to have her play the beloved matriarch, who is now 98 years old.\n\nAnd while Henson felt that she was in the presence of a queen-and-superhero hybrid, it was Johnson's humility that floored her. Johnson told Henson that it's just the way things were and she just wanted to do her job and do it well. Henson was blown away, as we will be with her performance. Taraji P. Henson becomes Katherine Johnson\u2014embodying struggle and flight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOctavia Spencer, who portrays Vaughn, was the first to sign on to the hefty project, and she just knew she needed to be a part of it. So of course the director, Theodore \u201cTed\u201d Melfi, locked the Oscar-winning actress in. At the Hidden Figures press conference, of her portrayal of Vaughn, she said, \"There\u2019s enough negative images of black women out there. I didn\u2019t want to portray her in some stereotype. I wanted to make sure her integrity was preserved.\u201d\n\nThese heroes' images are not only preserved but reinvigorated. These women will help future generations defy the world's limitations. Margot Shetterly, the author of the book Hidden Figures, which was being produced the same time as the movie, says that her mission was to expand the idea of what black women were capable of. \"They went to work and brought their A game. They did our country and women a great service. They are the American dream,\" Shetterly says.\n\nThis is a history lesson we all deserve. Knowing that black women were the backbone of one of the biggest space missions in America is knowing that we can be anything. It's knowing that #BlackGirlMagic is an actual trait in our DNA that allows us to excel gracefully. It's knowing that even when we're \"hidden figures,\" we're still there, making our mark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheck out the trailer:", "keywords": ["world", "hidden", "extraordinary", "changed", "black", "history", "henson", "upholds", "right", "knowing", "johnson", "figures", "women", "legacy", "mission"], "polarity": 0.14494047619047615, "subjectivity": 0.49054232804232795},

The reader follows Jenkins, now 25, just a few miles but a lifetime away to New York City, where she is eager to land bylines at the world\u2019s top publications.\n\nAlong the way, Jerkins takes the reader to deeply personal and, at times, uncomfortable places. She chronicles her struggles with dating and heartbreak, unflinchingly guides her reader through a personal surgical procedure and wrestles with a variety of different gazes: that of white men and white women, but also of potential lovers, of her host families and other people in Japan and Russia, of her black female peers and, most important, her own evolving view of herself.\n\nThe work-in-progress nature shows at times. Gay mentioned in a recent interview with Jerkins in Elle magazine that \u201cthere are places where I wanted [Jerkins] to push her conclusions further,\u201d and Jerkins\u2019 approach to certain topics likely won\u2019t be appreciated by everyone. Jerkins\u2019 feminism includes unbowed self-advocacy, and some readers may find fault with the way she calls out specific people and their behaviors, including some high-profile black women. For her part, Jerkins says she \u201cstands by the book and everything I wrote in it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPutting it all out there, she said in conversation with The Glow Up, is the whole point.\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: This interview has been edited and condensed.]\n\n\n\nOn writing about having labiaplasty\u2014and other taboo subjects:\n\n\u201cI was worried about what my mother would think, what my father would think, the church in which I was raised would think. The men whom I haven\u2019t even met, I wondered what they would think\u2014would I be unattractive to them?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe whole point of the book was just to lay it all out there on the table, and not with the aim that you agree with me, but that you at least have an understanding of where I\u2019m coming from. I probably look at certain chapters where I talk about dating or where I talk about my labiaplasty, and I\u2019ll look at it and I\u2019ll still feel that reverberation\u2014like, you had to go there?\u201d\n\nOn revealing the more unflattering parts of her experiences:\n\n\u201cWriting about yourself isn\u2019t supposed to be easy. Anytime you feel nervous about writing about something, I believe that\u2019s when you know you\u2019re on the right track. ... I had to keep telling myself, \u2018Stop worrying about that invisible person and whether or not they\u2019re going to be freaked out by it or whatever. Think about the people that might read a little bit more expansively because of what you\u2019ve said. Or don\u2019t think of anybody. Write what needs to be said. What you want it to say.\u2019 That\u2019s what I had to do.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the pain of being called \u201cintimidating\u201d:\n\n\u201cThe worst thing someone can say about me in a personal sense, because I\u2019ve heard other media outlets say this about me, is that I\u2019m intimidating. Sometimes it hurts more than someone calling me a bitch or cunt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know that as soon as they utter that word, I think about all of the times where I have been pressured, subconsciously or not, implicitly or explicitly, to shrink\u2014or be completely shut off from romantic love for the rest of my life.\n\n\u201cIt makes me feel so large and like there\u2019s no room for anyone else. \u2026 It makes me feel like they\u2019re saying, \u2018Well, there\u2019s no room for me in your life.\u2019 How can I even fit, metaphorically or figuratively, in your life, in this conversation? It\u2019s like a rejection, but it\u2019s also like, \u2018Stay the way you are.\u2019 And it\u2019s like, but if you\u2019re telling me, and so many other people are telling me this, then where does that leave me?\u201d\n\nOn receiving her first vibrator\u2014from her mother:\n\n\u201cWhen I tell you that my body was on fire\u2014I had all of this kinetic energy and my heart just got broken. I didn\u2019t know what happened. I just wanted to be touched and I wasn\u2019t getting it anywhere. There were moments when I was just waking up in the middle of the night just like, it felt crazy. And my mother was kind enough to be like, \u2018I\u2019m going to help you because, what else can I do?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe knew that I was going through it. And it\u2019s a very taboo subject in Christian circles, but it helped me because it helped me to take control of my sexuality. And also it helped me to avoid situations that were not going to be healthy for me.\n\n\u201cNow that I\u2019m an adult, my mother and I have talks about men and everything like that more vividly and more explicitly. It was powerful for me because it let me know that she cared. It let me know that I could talk to her about pretty much anything. When I had my labioplasty, she was there; when my stepfather passed, she was there. There [were] so many moments when she was there.\n\n\u201cI think people have to recognize that black mothers, they aren\u2019t all the same. But in terms of my black mother, she was trying to do stuff [that] when I was younger might seem like, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s trying to make you assimilate to something.\u2019 But she just knows how the world is, and how cruel the world is to black girls.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn being progressive and Christian:\n\n\u201cI think what is important for people of color who identify as Christian to do is to divorce themselves from a white male lens. A lot of times, I\u2019ll meet Christian people and their politics aren\u2019t there. And then I\u2019ll meet people who I\u2019m really great with politically, and they\u2019re agnostic or atheist, and I\u2019m like, well. ... I think the thing for me is it takes deeper investigation on my part to say, \u2018How do I think about Christianity in a liberating sense away from a white male lens?\u2019 And that may be more self-study and less relying on preachers to tell me everything.\u201d\n\nOn how her faith influences her ambition:\n\n\u201cI have to remind myself that if it\u2019s true that what it says\u2014that God knew before I was even born; that he stitched every part of me before I was even conceived of\u2014then why am I going to deny myself? When I think of the professional endeavors ... I think back [to] getting published in the New Yorker at 23 years old. Where did I have the nerve to think [I could do] that?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I used to teach, people, they would say, \u2018Well, how did you know you were ready? Did you say, \u201cOh, I\u2019m going to write 20 articles before I pitch there?\u201d\u2019 And I just said, \u2018I don\u2019t ask for permission in anything that I do in this world, because no one is going to just give it to me. What I can do is come to you with this opportunity that I want. Say, these are the reasons why I can do it.\u2019 And you take from that what you will.\u201d\n\nOn impostor syndrome and the audacity of being on the cover of your own book:\n\n\u201cThere was belief, but don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014when those pieces were, in fact, published, I had very terrible impostor syndrome. I\u2019m talking about looking at my byline, tracing each letter of my name with my eyes and still not believing that I wrote that. ... There were many times with this book ...with the anticipation of it all, [thinking,] \u2018How dare I think that I can write what I just wrote? Where did that type of courage come from?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEven now, when I look at the cover of my book, I think, \u2018How dare I look so proud of my own book? How dare I even be on it?\u2019 But I think what I have to emphasize is that I\u2019ve always been afraid. I\u2019ve always been a worryful person; I just don\u2019t let it overtake the courage.\u201d\n\nOn living in an unapologetically black space:\n\n\u201cI think Harlem is the only place where I\u2019m not so hyperconscious about white people. I know that if I go to the nearest store and I got a scarf on my head, no one\u2019s going to treat me any differently. I will still be acknowledged. ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHarlem is different for me, because it\u2019s the only place where I\u2019m not second-guessing any type of mode of behavior that I have. Despite gentrification, I\u2019m not worried about the white person next to me. I know I\u2019m going to be acknowledged regardless of what I have on my head, what it is that I\u2019m wearing. Nobody\u2019s going to deny me proper treatment.\u201d\n\nOn growing into, and accepting, a desire to be beautiful:\n\n\u201cI think my conception of beauty happened [in] two different ways: One was when I saw Zadie Smith in person, and I was like, she looks exactly as she does in the pictures. A part of me was like, \u2018Oh my God. I\u2019m jealous! She\u2019s stunning!\u2019 And then when I got on the cover of my book, I became much more hyperaware of how I looked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was like, it wasn\u2019t just enough for me to be a great writer, which is what I strive to be all the time. But I wanted people to say that \u2018she\u2019s beautiful\u2019 as well, because that\u2019s the culture we live in. And also because I\u2019ve denied myself acknowledgment of my beauty.\n\n\u201cI feel empowered putting on a bold lipstick. I feel empowered when I try on a new eye shadow in a color that I never thought that I would really like, to be able to indulge in that way, because I never really did that for myself. And if someone acknowledges that attention that I spend on myself, then so be it. It makes me feel good!\n\n\u201cAnd I want to be able to say that with confidence and not think that is, you know, that\u2019s going to be detrimental to my art. Because this is such a personal book, that\u2019s why I\u2019m like\u2014I think that I\u2019m noticing the relationship. It definitely kicked into heavy gear when I was on the cover of my own book.

Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Taraji P. Henson and Octavia Spencer, the movie's three stars, were among the notable women on the panel, as well as the author of the book on which the movie is based, Margot Lee Shetterly.\n\nHidden Figures tells the incredible story of three brilliant African-American women\u2014Katherine Johnson (Henson), Dorothy Vaughn (Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Mon\u00e1e)\u2014who worked at NASA and were the brains behind the launch of astronaut John Glenn into orbit. The trio made history not only as women but as African-American women.\n\nDuring the panel discussion, the audience heard a bit about the lives and stories behind each character, especially concerning Katherine Johnson, who is celebrated in the film as the main source of intelligence behind one of the greatest operations in NASA history.\n\nHenson described Johnson as a courageous woman living in a time in history when accomplishments like hers were unheard of.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"You're talking about being the first woman in a room of all white men at a time where that was not popular. The courage to even walk in that room with your head held high,\" she said. \"I don't think many people could do that. Just the fear of 'What are they going to think of me?' or 'Will I make it?' The courage just to walk in that room speaks to her fearlessness, speaks to her tenacity, speaks to her brilliance.\n\n\"At the end of the day, you couldn't take her mind from her. You could call her all kinds of names and belittle her efforts, but she had a brilliant mind that God gave her. And she walked in that. She did not complain,\" Henson added.\n\nThe idea of Johnson not complaining was something that Henson emphasized and acknowledged that she learned and took away from in playing the role.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I use that in my life,\" she said. \"I don't complain about Hollywood. I don't say that they don't do this for black women and that and the third; I just keep working because one day you look up and you're a Golden Globe winner, you're Academy Award-nominated, but I couldn't get there by complaining.\"\n\nDorothy Vaughan, played by Spencer, was Johnson's supervisor, and Mary Jackson, played by Mon\u00e1e, was an engineer who also worked at the agency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen speaking of these three historic and inspiring women, Michelle Obama underlined the great dedication each had to their field, as well as their ability to maintain their poise during the racism and sexism that they faced at the time.\n\n\"Now, these women couldn't even drink from the same water fountain or use the same bathroom as many of their colleagues,\" the first lady pointed out. \"And folks didn't always take these women seriously because they were black and also because they were women. \u2026 But they didn't listen to those doubters, you understand? They did not listen to the haters.\"\n\nThe event was held in front of a small audience, much of it high school and middle school students. And so, fittingly, one of the main themes that seemed to be seen throughout the presentation was the importance of hard work and how far it can get individuals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"What also matters is how hard you're willing to work,\" Michelle Obama said. \"Because none of this is easy, and it's not supposed to be.\"\n\nWhen discussing hard work, the first lady referenced her own husband, President Barack Obama, and his diligent work ethic and serious commitment to his job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Look at this eight years,\" she said. \"We were supposed to be 'hidden.' People didn't even want to believe we were real. But here we are, eight years later.\"\n\nObama further solidified her point, quoting Katherine Johnson toward the end of her remarks, saying, \"Stick with it; no matter the problem it can be solved.\"\n\nVeronica Graves is a digital-news associate at The Root.

Some great moments deserve a sequel, and we\u2019ve therefore done some deep investigative journalism to get the details on our favorite look of Grammy night 2018.\n\nAs previously posted, Eve was our hands-down winner of this year\u2019s awards ceremony, despite not being nominated this year (sorry, Beyonc\u00e9). Thanks to our intrepid, talented and well-connected Gizmodo Media Group family (we\u2019re talking about you, Victor Amos!), we were able to get the scoop on Eve\u2019s incredible Grammys style\u2014and, most important, how to imitate it.\n\nLet\u2019s start with that gorgeous face: Makeup artist Ernesto Casillas has been working with Eve since the promotional tour for Barbershop and counts her among his favorite clients. For her Grammys look, he rose to the occasion while not even knowing what the star would be wearing, as he tells The Glow Up:\n\nFor the look, I knew right away that I wanted to keep it pretty and somewhat classic. We didn\u2019t know exactly what outfit she was going to wear up until right before she went on, so I wanted to keep the colors neutral and paint her in a way that she would feel confident and pretty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe multihyphenate added \u201cred-carpet host\u201d to her title this year, co-hosting the evening\u2019s Grammy Red Carpet Live with Entertainment Tonight\u2019s Nancy O\u2019Dell, Kevin Frazier and Keltie Knight. To make sure the star stayed stellar-looking throughout the day, Casillas had a strategy:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCasillas also wanted to make sure the focus stayed where it belonged while his star was speaking on the red carpet:\n\nEve usually likes to opt for a nude pink lip, but I knew I wanted a midtone lip, since she was wearing a suit and would be interviewing people. I wanted the mouth to also be a focus, but not too dark, either. I lined the lips with a deep berry color and filled in with a lighter, peachier shade. I used Kat Von D\u2019s \u201cLolita\u201d lipstick and some nude gloss over that.\n\nAnd lest we forget that Eve opted to wear not one, but two d\u00e9colletage-baring blazers during the evening, Casillas certainly didn\u2019t, using Gleam Body Bronzing Lotion in shade Deep Gold on her chest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as for that mane of perfectly tousled waves Eve was rocking over her shoulder? You can thank hairstylist Angela Christine, who\u2019s been working with Eve for over seven years and also styles her for The Talk. Christine tells The Glow Up:\n\nShe\u2019s an amazing person to work with, [and] really makes the job easy. Eve loves strong and effortless, so once she chose the suit, she wanted something that felt relaxed and beautiful at the same time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that deciding on Eve\u2019s style was effortless; Christine was ready for a big chop, but the star felt otherwise. \u201cWe actually went back and forth about the hair. ... I wanted to do a shorter, edgy cut, but she was serious about keeping it long,\u201d Christine says.\n\nAnd as for that color? Christine says that she and Eve have been playing with both warm and cool tones lately, and the honey tone was actually done well in advance. The extensions actually came from Christine\u2019s own line, Conscious Curls, in a texture called Strength, which closely resembles natural hair blown out. \u201cThis [allowed] for lots of fullness and volume, which we both loved,\u201d Christine says.\n\nChristine then used a medium-barrel ceramic curling iron to achieve those gorgeous loose waves, strategically curling in opposite directions for a messier look. She then used Ouai Rose Oil and Kenra Texturizing Taffy to create even more separation and texture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristine\u2014who, in addition to working for The Talk, also has a salon in West Hollywood, Calif., and consults for other beauty brands\u2014is releasing a series of affirming children\u2019s books called the Pretty Curls Club.

Henson and Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2014had been sold. This comes as no surprise: The story of these brilliant African-American female \u201chuman computers\u201d who were instrumental in calculating the math necessary to propel rockets into space is fascinating. The only surprise is that this story has not been told before.\n\nNovelist Toni Morrison says, \u201cIf there\u2019s a book that you want to read but it hasn\u2019t been written yet, then you must write it.\u201d Enter Shetterly, who grew up in Hampton, Va., the site where this mathematical research was done\u2014and who also knew first-hand many of the black women who had been employed to do these mathematical calculations.\n\n\u201cThe idea that black women had been recruited to work as mathematicians at the NASA installation in the South during the days of segregation defies our expectations and challenges much of what we think we know about American history,\u201d writes Shetterly.\n\nSimply put, this book is the story she needed to write.\n\n\u201cAs a child, I knew so many African Americans working in science, math and engineering that I thought that\u2019s just what black folks did,\u201d writes Shetterly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was her normal. There was Mrs. Land, a NASA mathematician who taught Sunday school every Sunday morning. There was Katherine Johnson, who worked on computing the trajectory for John Glenn\u2019s space flight. There was Dorothy Vaughan, who wrote the textbook on algebraic methods for the mechanical calculating machines used throughout the department.\n\nAnd these women are just the beginning.\n\n\u201cI can put names to almost 50 black women who worked as computers, mathematicians, engineers or scientists at the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory from 1943 through 1980, and my intuition is that 20 more names can be shaken loose from the archives with more research,\u201d writes Shetterly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Shetterly is careful to note that what seemed normal to her did not come easily to this previous generation. Her father, growing up during segregation, had a passion for engineering but was told to become a physical education teacher instead.\n\n\u201cIn those days,\u201d writes Shetterly, \u201ccollege-educated African Americans with book smarts and common sense put their chips on teaching jobs or sought work at the post office.\u201d\n\nShetterly\u2019s father\u2019s love of engineering\u2014\u201che built his first rocket in junior high metal shop class\u201d\u2014would not let him give up his dream. Still, it was not easy: \u201cAs late as 1970, just 1 percent of all American engineers were black\u2014a number that doubled to a whopping 2 percent by 1984,\u201d writes Shetterly. \u201cStill, the federal government was the most reliable employer of African Americans in the sciences and technology: In 1984, 8.4 percent of NASA\u2019s engineers were black.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHidden Figures shines a much-needed light on the contributions of black women in science and technology that have been vastly overlooked. In prose that is engaging and compelling, Shetterly refutes the commonly held stereotype that STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields are the province of men, specifically white men. Black women have been doing this work for ages. Before desktop computers, black women were the computing machines, using their vast intelligence to determine the orbital trajectories of space flight and accomplish other leading discoveries in aerodynamics and engineering.\n\n\u201cEven as a professional in an integrated world, I have been the only black woman in enough drawing rooms and boardrooms to have an inkling of the chutzpah it took for an African-American woman in a segregated southern workplace to tell her bosses she was sure her calculations would put a man on the Moon,\u201d Shetterly writes.\n\nIt is this empathy with her subjects\u2014her ability to put herself in their shoes\u2014that brings the narrative to life. Steeped in history and thorough research, Shetterly also crafts richly drawn portrayals of these black women who were mathematicians, engineers and scientists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn vivid, specific detail, Shetterly paints the personal and professional lives of these black women who were vital to America\u2019s scientific advancement. We see their brilliance in their work; we see the ever-present institutional racism; we see the racist microaggressions from white colleagues; we see the inevitable \u201cColored Only\u201d signs on drinking fountains and bathrooms in their workplace Langley. And yet these women were responsible for some of the greatest scientific advancements of the age.\n\nThis is a book that should be required reading in schools\u2014both as a history of science and technology and an inspiration for young black women to succeed in STEM fields. This is history that needs to be told; this is history that is still an ever-present reality for women of color working in STEM fields.\n\nBy celebrating these black female \u201chuman computers,\u201d we give credit to the work of black women that has, like the achievements of black women in so many other fields, historically been ignored. In Shetterly\u2019s clear, vibrant prose, we have a compelling, thoroughly researched narrative that is in a class of its own.

Her rich roots and passion for culinary arts were inspired by cooking with her grandmother at a very young age; years later, she\u2019d moonlight in the hospitality industry after earning credentials from Eastern Michigan University to be a social worker.\n\n\u201cI always worked at least two jobs, and if one of them was cooking, I was very happy,\u201d says Scott.\n\nAfter getting laid off from her position as a social worker\u2014and eventually hitting rock bottom\u2014she explored opportunities in the culinary field.\n\n\u201cI cannot say that [culinary] was really my choice; it was very organic. The only other thing I loved was food and cooking. I lost my home, car, everything\u2014that\u2019s how my first real cooking job came about. I decided to work on a major cruise line.\u201d\n\nFour years after her full-time transition into the hospitality industry, Scott enrolled in culinary school\u2014and quickly learned how complicated the business can be. An internship with the Food Network provided her initial exposure to culinary media, food styling and networking with established peers, eventually allowing her to gain culinary clients of her own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShortly after, she pursued her master\u2019s degree in entertainment business from Full Sail University and transitioned into a career as a culinary producer: a multifaceted position that dabbles in all areas on set to run a smooth production. Her experience now includes being the culinary producer of season 2 of Bravo\u2019s hit television show Chef Roble and Company, Throwdown With Bobby Flay and the Cooking Channel.\n\nProgressing her way through a multilayered industry, she landed more exceptional positions, working alongside The Chew\u2019s Carla Hall at the Barbados Food, Wine and Rum Festival and becoming a food stylist for Michael Symon and Daphne Oz.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlossoming in the culinary industry has been a blessing, but despite her qualifications, Scott has experienced disappointment in the field she loves, being passed up for many opportunities. She explains:\n\nI vividly remember being called by the hiring manager of a major network with excitement in her voice, [calling me] the \u201cperfect candidate.\u201d I was told that I\u2019d be moving to the next round of interviews, and then I didn\u2019t get a call back. Inquiring about the follow-up, I was met with her less-than-enthusiastic\u2014almost bothered\u2014tone. The job was given to a young woman who just finished her internship\u2014she was white. That\u2019s just one example, and there are quite a few\u2014each one heartbreaking and disconcerting. The takeaway for me was that when something new or different is happening, it\u2019s always met with resistance. I always knew that it was my personal mission to end these cycles by breaking down these barriers. I later learned that like any building, there\u2019s ways to get in other than the front door; I began to curate my career, diversify my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and make myself marketable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd she did\u2014Scott is the founder of SheChef, a culinary mentorship and leadership program for aspiring women chefs and professionals.\n\nIn a male-dominated industry, chef Elle noted that food styling and culinary production are not. \u201cThese are probably two of few areas dominated by women, [but] women of color remain a minority in these areas.\u201d She cites culinary producers like like Ma\u2019at Zachary and owners of Powerhouse Productions Rochelle Brown and Sonia Armstead as excellent examples in the industry, while Rosecleer-Marie Powell and Sade Aguila are two of many slaying the food styling game.\n\nBut Scott\u2019s rise in the culinary world was interrupted by her diagnosis with stage 1C, grade 3 ovarian cancer\u2014a cancerous tumor resting on her right ovary. Enduring six rounds of chemotherapy over a five-month period and laparoscopic surgery removing her ovary and right fallopian tube, she experienced emotional and physical changes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI dealt with perpetual nausea but never once vomited, extreme fatigue and worked all about a total of eight days within that five-month period,\u201d she says. \u201cI was on a large amount of steroids, getting medication\u2014Taxol and Carboplatin\u2014intravenously and gained 23 pounds that I\u2019m still struggling to lose. I couldn\u2019t eat much unless it was salty; lost all of my hair, even my eyelashes. I had my last round of chemo at the end of January 2017.\u201d\n\nShe credited cancer with curing her of \u201cpersonal vanity\u201d and opts to spend more time being \u201cpresent,\u201d valuing life a bit more. This January will mark a year in remission, but whenever she experiences aches, pains and changes that aren\u2019t documented as side effects, she\u2019s a bit skeptical.\n\n\u201cAnyone having unattended health issues: GO TO THE DOCTOR!\u201d she urges. \u201cI feel like people of color, especially black Americans, have issues with approaching health care in this country\u2014not that I blame them one bit. As it relates to cancer and most other diseases, early detection can and possibly will save your life. Genetic testing is a new tool for detection; request it and accept it if offered. As clich\u00e9d as it sounds, stay positive. I believe healing begins in the mind and resonates through the body.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScott advises fighters and survivors to embrace their feelings\u2014good or bad.

All for some misbegotten plan that he cooked up in his head to start a race war.\n\nRoof seems to have inhabited some dark corner of the world where hate-filled little men go to stew in their own vitriol and ass-backward beliefs about whatever specific groups they either distrust, flat out hate or blame for making their world such a horrible place. Whether I like it or not, it\u2019s their right to go online, to a bar, to a shack in the woods or any other place to do so, but unfortunately, every now and then, the Dylann Roofs of the world decide to put words into action, and now nine families, a church, a town, a state and a nation have had to deal with the fallout.\n\nAlmost a year before Roof\u2019s alleged actions at Mother Emanuel, another angry young man, Elliot Rodger, shot and stabbed his way through an area near the University of California, Santa Barbara, killing six and injuring 14. Rodger left behind YouTube videos and manifestos to illustrate his motives in the most frightening ways possible. Unlike Roof\u2019s, Rodger\u2019s hatred was mostly focused on women and his lack of success with them. To wage this \u201cwar on women,\u201d little Elliot Rodgers went out and purchased a Glock 34 and a pair of Sig Sauer P226 pistols, then took out his rage on a group of innocent people. All before killing himself like a coward.\n\nThat brings us to Omar Mateen, whose deeds are fresh in our minds. In what seems be a strange mix of self-hatred, religion-based homophobia and extremist Islamic beliefs, Mateen killed 49 patrons of Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. He started shooting people simply because they were either homosexual, allied with the LGBT community or just dancing before last call.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe really messed-up part is that mass shootings will happen again. I don\u2019t know when or how soon, but something akin to this will occur at some point. The same questions will be asked. The same expressions of sorrow and concern will be made. The nation\u2019s leaders will opine on the state of things and what can be done to prevent this from happening again, and the public will forget about it all within a few months.\n\nOne of the few certainties about these incidents is that they have two frightening commonalities: an angry young man and guns. No matter where you are, a young man who feels wronged and possesses a gun is a recipe for disaster. The stamped metal of a Kalashnikov, the plastic polymer of an AR-15 and the 2 pounds\u2019 worth of steel that make up most handguns have forever made small, angry men feel big.\n\nSadly, in the United States, which fancies itself a \u201cdeveloped\u201d nation, these angry little men have utilized their Second Amendment rights to wage an assault on those who have drawn their ire. And the next mass shooting will be another reminder that, while we will never run out of angry young men, we have failed in preventing them from arming themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a gun owner, I find myself running through various scenarios on how to regulate an industry with constitutional protection and tons of money to lobby politicians to limit gun control. I\u2019m honestly fresh out of ideas on how to force the government and the gun industry into supporting stricter gun measures. What would it take to scare America into saying, \u201cOK, we need to seriously rethink the kind of guns we allow on the streets\u201d?\n\nLast November, actor Wendell Pierce tweeted, \u201cIf every Black male 18-35 applied for a conceal & carry permit, and then joined NRA in one day; there would be gun control laws in a second.\u201d\n\nSure, it sounds insane, but I bet it would work. Although I would never join the National Rifle Association, I wonder if gun regulations would change. I can\u2019t help pondering how those who are staunchly opposed to gun control would spin their new views given the NRA\u2019s history with the Black Panther Party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether or not we pass stricter gun control, America has a serious problem, and on any given day, we could find ourselves trapped in a nightmare like the folks at Mother Emanuel, Pulse or UC Santa Barbara just because some angry little man got a gun and decided to make some twisted statement.\n\n\n\nKeith Young lives in Charleston, S.C.

This was the whitest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScary\n\nThe sunken place, of course.\n\nThe kidnapping at the beginning of the movie, which could actually land in the funny category because of Stanfield\u2019s self-aware comments to himself before he was taken. He was also acting as a bit of a black-audience-member stand-in, but it was too late for him. He was already doomed.\n\nThe several jump scares throughout the movie, starting with the deer hitting Rose and Chris\u2019 car (which, in the theater I was in, made a woman in front of me say, \u201cMan, fuck this shit\u201d).\n\nThe stretch where Chris is subdued and then prepped for his lobotomy.\n\nThe moments after Chris escapes when both \u201cGrandma\u201d and \u201cGrandpa\u201d spring to life and try to kill him.\n\nThe scariest scene of all\u2014to me, at least\u2014is when the cop car approaches after Chris has finished murdering all of those white people and their black help. Of course, it turned out to be his boy there to rescue him, but even I felt my fight-or-flight sense engaged when seeing that.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe answer here depends on your perspective. And also, oddly, racial politics. I laughed more while watching the movie than I was scared. Even the \u201cscary\u201d parts were followed by chuckles of recognition. Like, \u201cHoly shit, I can\u2019t believe this is happening.\u201d I also saw it in a predominantly black movie theater, and my reactions mirrored those of most of the moviegoers.\n\nThat said, I have to admit that I\u2019d probably feel a certain way if I watched it in a predominantly white theater and heard laughs during some of the scarier/creepier parts. Like, um, y\u2019all don\u2019t have permission to be laughing at any of this! THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!!!

Luckily, our editor-in-chief, Danielle Belton, was able to score tickets so that we could be there to give you our impressions of the film. (Although we\u2019re not too spoilery, if you\u2019re afraid to know too much, it might be better to see the movie first.)\n\n\n\nDanielle Belton, Editor-in-Chief\n\nFor most of Black Panther, I couldn\u2019t believe what I was watching. An African nation that was never colonized? Two black women talking to each other about their mission and not, I dunno, either not talking at all or talking about a man? Moments that went on forever where no white characters spoke, or where they were summarily chastised for speaking? Black women who were fully realized characters with agency and their own beliefs? Black men who were completely confident and actualized in their ideals, even if the viewpoints were opposing and varied? A cinematic parallel for the real-world tensions and conflicts that often exist between Africans and African Americans? Black people who were the victors and not victims? What!\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat did I just watch?\u201d was all I could think after I saw it, but in a good way\u2014but also in a sad way, in that I\u2019m 40 and a lifelong movie lover who\u2019s seen almost every clich\u00e9 in cinema; but Black Panther took clich\u00e9 and chucked it off a waterfall, making me wonder why Hollywood is so lazy and often afraid of new ideas that it took this long to see a black film like this, on this scale.\n\nBut ultimately, I want to see more. I want there to be a sequel (I\u2019d love to see where things go in Wakanda after the actions of this film), but I also want there to be more blockbuster movies that take risks and tell new stories. Lastly, I want people to respect assigned seating in theaters. One dude in our theater almost ruined the entire movie because he did not want to find his ... probably crappy ... seat. But nobody has time for this game of seat leap frog. Not today.\n\n\n\nGenetta M. Adams, Managing Editor\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been this hyped for a movie. And in this age when the most eager fans can line up the night before the official opening to see a movie, I\u2019ve rarely felt the urge to be among the first paying customers to see a film\u2014until now.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the splendor and beauty of Wakanda washed over me, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what Africa would\u2019ve looked like if it had never been invaded by colonizers. What if the continent\u2019s vast riches were never stolen and the plunder of black bodies never happened? Black Panther offers the best version of that possibility.\n\n\n\nThe eye-popping fashion was even more amazing on the big screen (and if costume designer Ruth E. Carter isn\u2019t nominated for ALL the awards, I\u2019m boycotting award shows forever). And the storyline (again, the screenplay and director Ryan Coogler better be up for ALL the awards) is so timely and relevant that I actually felt empathy for the \u201cvillain\u201d Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan).\n\n\n\nAnd though the movie is called Black Panther, it is the black women of Wakanda\u2014from the fiercest warriors of the Dora Milaje to Shuri (Letitia Wright), the brilliant scientist who develops Wakanda\u2019s tech (and delivers the funniest lines in the movie), and the calm, regal beauty of Queen Mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett)\u2014who give the movie its heart. I wish my 12-year-old self could have seen such badass black women so prominently featured in a big-budget action movie. And I know that 12-year-old black girls who see the movie today will feel inspired and empowered by these black women, and encouraged to pursue their dreams, no matter what.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLook for me in the line as I hit the theater a few more times to bask in the glorious world of Wakanda.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nAngela Helm, Contributing Editor\n\nI was hopeful but a little bit afraid of the hype surrounding Black Panther (see Empire three years ago). I shouldn\u2019t have been. It was every single thing. Big-budget action. Drama. Comic relief. And an all-encompassing, well-lit blackness that flew off the screen and overwhelmed my senses.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere will be much said about Killmonger, a complicated character who had one of the most powerful lines of the film (I gasped when he said it, and then threw a hand in the air), but what I loved most about him was that although he graduated from the Naval Academy at 19 and went to MIT, he was still so Oakland with his gold teeth and unrepentant brilliance.\n\n\n\nThe white gaze was nonexistent. This was for us, by us and quite possibly a game changer for cinema. I cannot wait for my unborn grandchildren to see it. Wakanda forever.\n\nCorey Townsend, Weekend Social Editor\n\nOne word: FASHION! The looks that were served in Black Panther sent me into a state of euphoria. The bold patterns served as a reminder that color was indeed invented for those with melanin.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe movie also served as a reminder that the world would be lost without black women!\n\nTerrell Jermaine Starr, Senior Reporter\n\nAs soon as I stepped out of the movie theater, I was no longer in Wakanda. And that made me sad. I was forced to share an UberPool with two colonizers. I wanted to yell \u201cColonizers!\u201d and ask them for their tourist visas, but I could not. We weren\u2019t in Wakanda. Nor am I Shuri. I am joking, but I\u2019m really not.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more than two hours, I was surrounded by blackness, consumed with a power of self and possibility I\u2019d never experienced during a film. For two hours, whiteness was not centered. I was. It was challenging to wrestle with that reality and the possibilities of such a world because I was born into a reality where whiteness is the default. My struggles, my successes, my dreams are all predicated on fending off and negotiating with whiteness. In Wakanda, whiteness negotiates with me and has few options but to comply.\n\nThat is a wonderful feeling. I have never watched a Marvel film\u2014nor am I a comics fan\u2014but that has changed. Black Panther left me with a buoyancy about what our current world strives to make impossible: a world centered in blackness, our existence. There are no bells and whistles to Wakanda. It just was. For two hours, so was I. I just was.\n\nNow I am in America, where just being is a struggle. I long for Wakanda.\n\nDanielle Young, Producer\n\nThis is my second time seeing Black Panther, and it won\u2019t be my last. My emotions are not done with this movie. It not only lives up to the epic hype but also pens the only love letter to Diasporic blackness that you\u2019ll ever need. When I got a chance to watch the movie the first time, I wrote a spoiler-free review that allowed me to dig into the black pride this movie undeniably gifts you. Watching T\u2019Challa\u2019s (Chadwick Boseman) baby sister, Shuri, bounce around her lab, brilliantly leading Wakanda\u2019s tech, made me feel like a little girl watching her new role model. Representation matters, and there\u2019s nothing quite like showing little black girls and boys that tech is a possibility for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are just so many good parts, pieces, moments, visuals, everything, but Killmonger is another standout. Obviously, Michael B. Jordan is ribbed for our pleasure, but his portrayal of a villain is delicious. His character is so well-rounded, so wounded and almost right in his attempt to dethrone King T\u2019Challa. And having his character represent black America in the sense of longing to reach home, the Motherland, was so uncomfortably beautiful. The only thing I have left to say about Black Panther is thank you for ...\u201dcolonizer.\u201d\n\nP.J. Rickards, Video Producer\n\nI\u2019ve been taking my 12-year-old son to see superhero movies for years now. It\u2019s definitely his thing: the opening, big action scenes, the one-liners, the larger-than-life graphics and the excitement after. It hit me while watching Black Panther: We\u2019re going to share that with a movie about a black superhero, strong black characters in a remarkable, all-black world. I already felt that way after seeing the trailer, but it was a whole other thing when I got to finally experience the full movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll I could think about was how he would react at certain parts and the discussions it could open up. And to see it with black people proud and dressed up. It reminded me a bit of the level of pride when Malcolm X came out and everyone was wearing X hats and dashikis. You could tell it was made with love by people of color for our people. It also made me hopeful that this will continue to be a regular occurrence, and even though it\u2019s a big deal for the grown-ups, the impact on young people growing up might be greater than we think.\n\nJason Johnson, Politics Editor\n\nI still don\u2019t know what the heck I saw, and I\u2019ve seen the movie three times. All I know is that I was fighting back thug tears every time Killmonger spoke, and this might\u2019ve been the first time in my life that I sat in a mostly black theater and people only made noise at the appropriate times. The other thing I know is this: it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s week and Black History Month, so if you bought us Black Panther tickets this weekend, we go together \u2026.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAshley Velez, Digital Video Producer\n\nBlack Panther made me feel so many things. I\u2019ve shouted \u201cWakanda forever!\u201d too many times to count since last night. Not only was Black Panther visually stunning\u2014from the cinematography to the lighting and costume design\u2014but the writing was also incredibly executed and engaging. It created space for film watchers to have meaningful dialogue surrounding things like generational trauma, conflicting methods of liberation, and identity throughout the Diaspora. Nothing about how these themes was presented felt forced, which is where modern films and television tend to drop the ball.\n\nI really appreciated the fact that Black Panther didn\u2019t feel like it solely revolved around T\u2019Challa\u2019s mental and physical conflicts. The bulk of the characters were elevated in sincere ways. Because of this, I was able to connect with multiple characters throughout the film. I still can\u2019t decide if I want to be Okoye (Danai Gurira), Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) or Shuri! That alone speaks to the significance of how black women were portrayed throughout the film.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh yeah, listen to the soundtrack again after watching the movie! I appreciated it so much more!\n\n\n\nA final note: If you\u2019re a colonizer, I feel bad for you, son.\n\nPsych. No, I don\u2019t.\n\nAnne Branigin, News Fellow\n\nBefore the film, I kept thinking about how Black Panther came out almost a year after Get Out. Wakanda is in some ways the antithesis of \u201cthe sunken place.\u201d Where the latter expressed a loss of control\u2014being at the mercy of \u201cbenevolent\u201d whiteness\u2014Wakanda represents liberation and self-determination in a powerful way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mother\u2019s country has been colonized twice: first by the Spanish, then by the U.S. Although one of our national heroes killed one of the world\u2019s greatest colonizers, Ferdinand Magellan, the enduring evidence of their actions is in our names, food, features, vocabulary. I love how Black Panther imagines a land written off as a Third World country as being, instead, a superpower\u2014a land free from colonization and subjugation. I love the questions it asks\u2014about what we could be if we got to keep the most precious parts of ourselves, and about the responsibility associated with that.\n\n", "keywords": ["world", "wakanda", "black", "night", "forever", "went", "movie", "panther", "opening", "film", "live", "thing", "women", "watching", "love"], "polarity": 0.11046091495310241, "subjectivity": 0.48518148518148513},

Which matters because when fuck fleeced Black people 1) happen to still be employed and 2) have a predetermined expiration date on said employment, all the Blackness that needed to be suppressed to keep said job has a way of bubbling up. Like a Black-ass, fuck scrapped volcano. And it matters even more today, the day of the Obama family's final Fourth of July at the White House. Which will undoubtedly be the Blackest thing the White House lawn has ever seen. We already know both Kendrick Lamar and Janelle Monae were invited to perform, and you do not invite both Kendrick Lamar and Janelle Monae to perform somewhere in 2016 unless you expect that somewhere to be charted in the Guinness Book of Blackness. So the only question that remains is exactly how Black will this BBQ be? Will it be acceptably, but not transcendently Black? (Like Jason Derulo.) Or will it be so Black that it even makes other Black people a little uncomfortable? (Like Kool-Aid at a wedding.)\n\nIn order to answer this question, a few more questions need to be asked and answered. (Ht to Errin Whack, who prompted this post after pointing out this performance in our Facebook messenger conversation yesterday about said White House BBQ)\n\n1. Will President Obama don his usual \"Guy At The YMCA You Don't Want To Pick On Your Team But Have To Because He's Your Boss And You're Dating His Daughter\" pick-up basketball outfit (white shirt tucked into blue joggers; blue joggers tucked into Under Armour Curry 2 Lows), or will he go full middle-aged Black uncle (either a white linen shorts set with Stacy Adams Cognac colored Belmar Sandals or white tube socks, flip-flops, jean shorts, and a Hanes ComfortBlend v-neck undershirt)?\n\n2. Who will be the White guy holding his own at the Spades table? (Probably Joe Biden. Actually, definitely Joe Biden.) And who will be the waaaaaay too awkward White guy who just hasn't been around this much Blackness before and doesn't know how to handle himself? (My guess? Paul Ryan.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Is Jesse Williams invited? If so, who will make his plate? (This is a trick question. Because Jesse Williams and his wife definitely make plates for each other.)\n\n4. Who's the official potato salad officiant? Is it Grandma Robinson? (Probably.) Does Michelle handle these duties herself? (Maybe.) Or is this the year they finally allow Malia to experiment with some recipe she learned in homeroom at Sidwell Friends, since its her birthday? (No.)\n\n5. Will every attendee get a red cup at the door, and will they have to write their names on said red cups with dry erase markers? (If so, I can totally see Oprah being asked to write her name on a cup, smiling, reaching in her purse, pulling out her own red cup with a diamond-crusted \"I'm Oprah, Bitches\" emblazoned on it, and walking away.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Will Sasha bring a date, and will the President have a jovial \"conversation\" with said date while two of his scariest secret service agents hover around, like hawks ready to pounce on a Jordan-rocking earthworm?\n\n7. Does Valerie Jarrett lead the Wobble, or does she use this time to grab another bottle of Jamaican Me Happy Seagram's Escapes?\n\n8. Did Kanye's and Kim's invites get, um, lost in the mail again, like what happened last year? (And the year before. And the year before that.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9.

The rap mogul was also honored with the President\u2019s Merit Award during the Clive Davis and Recording Academy\u2019s pre-Grammy gala on Jan. 27.\n\n\n\nIn true Carter-family style, Jay and Beyonc\u00e9 topped off their all-black-everything weekend by also attending last night\u2019s awards dressed in head-to-toe black. Bey wore an outfit worthy of a film noir femme fatale, in a dramatic hat, sunglasses and oversized earrings worn with a shoulder-baring velvet gown and violet lip. Jay-Z opted for \u201970s-era flair, pairing his tux with a turtleneck.

He has nestled in his full-length no fucks futon; his bare feet stretched on his no fucks ottoman, reading perhaps How to Give No Fucks and Influence People or Chicken Soup for the Fuck-less Soul.\n\nThis is the president we anticipated when all that hoping and changing was happening in 2007 and 2008. But, for very practical reasons \u2014 namely, the country wasn't quite ready for a Black president, much less a fuck deficient Black president \u2014 we didn't start to really see him until he was reelected. Which, again, makes perfect sense. You just don't go all DeMarcus Cousins at your new job before your first performance review. But he's here now, and it is glorious.\n\nAnd, to clarify, \"giving no fucks\" does not mean that President Obama \u2014 or anyone else who gives no fucks \u2014 is without a care or concern. It just means that you no longer care about and you're no longer concerned with meeting the unreachable expectations of people who don't actually want you to reach them. In Obama's case, these people are usually called \"conservatives.\" For laymen such as you and I, these people are usually called \"haters.\" President Obama does, in fact, seem to care about many things. ISIS. The economy. The Wire. Sasha's sartorial choices. Selfies with Michelle.\n\nAnd while tears aren't always a reliable measure of ones actual feelings about a subject, I have no doubt that the ones he shed at today's press conference, where he introduced new gun control measures, were real. Violence is not a uniquely American problem. For a developed country, however, gun violence is uniquely American, and its something we all have at least a tangential connection to. If you happen to be a Black American, this tangential connection becomes sturdier. I have been personally affected by gun violence. I've had friends killed, cousins incarcerated, and a home shot into. And I imagine most reading this can say similar things. No one \u2014 not even a millionaire family with two Ivy League-grad parents and two private school-attending teenage daughters \u2014 is immune, and I'm certain our president is aware of this. And I'm also certain he's aware, as many of us are, that the primary factor morphing perfunctory human agitation and conflict to the type of murder and mayhem we see today is the availability of guns.\n\nIf these measures \u2014 which, like all other gun control measures he's proposed, are so remarkably mundane and common-sensible that the pushback bleeds into absurdity \u2014 work, perhaps Congress will be shamed into following suit. I doubt that'll happen, though. Because while America having a fuck depleted Black president is one thing, America actually listening to him \u2014 even if he's telling a truth we know is true \u2014 is another.", "keywords": ["blackest", "fuck", "black", "week", "tears", "obamas", "fucks", "gun", "control", "hes", "happened", "obama", "care", "violence", "president", "measures", "thing"], "polarity": 0.018503988295654968, "subjectivity": 0.3528910133076802},

Blown away by the hit horror movie, the author and educator decided to design a semester-long special course about how horror and anti-black racism have intertwined in the cinema.\n\n\n\nBest known for books like My Soul to Keep and The Living Blood, Tananarive Due has been creating speculative fiction centered on the Afro-diasporan experience for decades. She\u2019s also a filmmaker and professor, having taught a course on Afrofuturism at UCLA for the past several years. When I talked to her on the phone last week, Due described herself as a lifelong horror fan and said that seeing Get Out got her thinking about how she could teach the history of horror genre work made about or by black people. The result of that thinking is \u201cThe Sunken Place: Racism, Survival, and Black Horror Aesthetic,\u201d a class that starts on September 28 at UCLA. In the edited and condensed conversation that follows, Due talks about early Hollywood horror, how Get Out has already changed the project development pipeline, and her own journey as a writer.\n\nio9: Let\u2019s start by you talking about where you got the idea for the course. Was it just from seeing Get Out?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTananarive Due: Well, number one, I\u2019m a horror head. That is just a constant in my life. But the idea for the course, specifically, came because Jordan Peele dropped Get Out when I was teaching my Afrofuturism course last spring at UCLA. And it was one of those things where the timing wasn\u2019t quite right and I thought, \u201cOh, I wish I used that in the course...\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve taught the Afrofuturism course, I think, about four times. And I thought, \u201cYou know...horror, to me, is a subset of Afrofuturism, in that fantasy is a subset of Afrofuturism.\u201d So, I decided, instead of doing the broader course, why not just break open black horror? Because Get Out is not the first black-made horror film, but it\u2019s definitely the most successful. And I think it definitely has the ability to be culture-changing, let\u2019s say.\n\nI also do some screenwriting, I\u2019m always trying to adapt my own work, and you know, often that\u2019s horror. You have to almost find a language to help the executives understand your horror as opposed to what they see as horror. Like, I\u2019m not pitching that story about a group of white teenagers terrorized by a stalker in the woods, right? My ideas weren\u2019t fitting the models of what they thought horror looked like. And the examples of previously made films just weren\u2019t strong enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nio9: And what were the examples?\n\nDue: One that was persistent was Beloved. That was the only reference point a lot of these executives had for what black horror would look like.\n\nio9: And that\u2019s probably only because of the adaptation from years ago, and not the Toni Morrison novel itself.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDue: Jonathan Demme did the film and\u2014you know, of course I have the greatest admiration for Toni Morrison and that\u2019s a Nobel-Prize winning novel\u2014but the film did not do that great at the box office. So, it was always an awkward comparison in a pitch scenario. Just this year, just recently, we were talking to some network execs about a pilot we were developing...and they were like, \u201cOh, like in Get Out. You can do \u2014 blahbiddyblahbiddyblah...\u201d And it\u2019s not that it\u2019s anything similar to Get Out, it\u2019s just that was now the new framework. That\u2019s what black horror looks like: Get Out. They can now have a reference point and you can continue with the conversation. Because before, you could barely even get that conversation started.\n\n\n\nThis amazing renaissance we\u2019re seeing right now of black speculative fiction and literature is really starting to bleed over\u2014no pun intended\u2014into film and television. I mean, I can list so many writers who have active TV development right now. Nnendi Okorafor has Who Fears Death at HBO. N.K. Jemisin\u2019s The Fifth Season at TNT. Victor LaValle with The Ballad of Black Tom at AMC. Clearly this is the moment, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBetween Get Out and Black Panther and A Wrinkle in Time coming out, with Ava [DuVernay] directing a multiracial cast\u2026 there\u2019s just never been a time like this. For artists and consumers of black, speculative art.\n\n\n\nYou asked a very specific question about, \u201cWhy horror?\u201d Look: I love horror. But it never dawned on me that I could have a black horror course before Get Out. When a movie like that comes along, you now have a reference point to talk about everything that has come before. [\u201cThe Sunken Place\u201d] is going to be a black horror overview course that will be very cinema-based. It\u2019ll look at cinema going back to the \u201930s. Both black-made movies and films that have blacks featured, which were very, very different movies then and are still usually very different movies now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nio9: I mean, D.W. Griffith\u2019s original Birth of a Nation is essentially a horror movie. It\u2019s white supremacist propaganda that depicts black people as monsters...\n\nDue: I\u2019ve been thinking about including Birth of a Nation as a horror movie. Because, in a lot of ways, it was just a really on-the-nose way of doing the same thing subsequent movies would do later with the buffoonery and the idea of black menace.\n\nThere was a scene in a Mantan Moreland movie called Lucky Ghost from the \u201940s where they put a plate of food in front of him. And the way he\u2019s eating the chicken reminded me so much of Birth of a Nation and the scene in the legislature.\n\nAnd I was just like, \u201cOkay, these portrayals are clearly connected...\u201d While I\u2019m doing a cinema-based overview course, I don\u2019t want to leave out the writers. So, to try and keep costs down, I think I\u2019ll have an emphasis on short fiction [as far as literature is concerned].\n\nAdvertisement\n\nio9: So far, what readings are you thinking about including?\n\nDue: I\u2019m still narrowing my list, but it\u2019ll include writers like Nisi Shawl, Nalo Hopkinson, and Kai Ashante Wilson. Those are the ones I\u2019ll name for now. There\u2019s certainly more I could include if I wanted to have five or six books in addition to short stories. I\u2019m trying to think of how to get Victor LaValle in this course, too, and even those Dark Dreams anthologies that Brandon Massey edited back in the day. But they\u2019re not that easy to get a hold of, now.\n\n\n\nI could probably get [Massey\u2019s] permission to photocopy some of those to share with the students. But the fact that a book like that is out of print becomes a problem, when you\u2019re trying to teach a course and want students to have access.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nio9: I know you worked as a journalist before writing fiction. Was it hard to make the leap?\n\nDue: I\u2019m not going to lie: it was fun when I quit my job. I was a reporter for The Miami Herald for 15 years. And God bless everybody there, journalists are beautiful people, I learned a lot, but\u2026 woo. That day I left, that was such a liberation. I just knew, in my heart, I was supposed to be writing fiction. Because, really, I needed to explore that part of me that was a fiction writer. We often talk about all the people who might not even think about [doing fiction or genre work] if there weren\u2019t other examples of writers doing it\u2026 I really had to struggle to give myself permission to write horror.\n\n\n\nio9: Your parents were in the Civil Rights Movement, which is a powerful backdrop for thinking about horror and the black existence in the United States of America. Everything from the Middle Passage onward has been fraught with horror. So, it\u2019s interesting to say you had to give yourself permission to write horror, because it\u2019s never been that far.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDue: You are absolutely right in terms of the themes. The emotions. Yes. We have been right in there in that horror experience. But, I was a developing writer looking out at the publishing industry and, really, it took Stephen King to create the horror subgenre. He created the horror section in bookstores. There are a lot of other great horror writers but I really feel like Stephen King anchored that whole thing. But, I was not seeing myself on those shelves, let\u2019s just say, in any of that work. It was not reflecting my experience. That\u2019s one part.\n\n\n\n... Hollywood has a special responsibility for the proliferation of white supremacist imagery. It really does. And I think that really calls for a responsibility to come fix it.\n\nHere\u2019s the other part: My father is a civil rights lawyer. He and my late mother, Patricia Stephens Due, were very well-respected in the community. I felt that it was veering off the path enough to not to go to law school, especially when both my sisters went. I felt blessed that my parents were deeply encouraging of me wanting to be an artist, but I didn\u2019t want to embarrass them. I can\u2019t be publishing anything that will bring them shame. This is all the voices in my head. It took a long time, especially without role models. I had read Mama Day by Gloria Naylor but I had not even discovered Octavia Butler\u2019s work. I had a conversation with Anne Rice. She didn\u2019t know I was a writer so she didn\u2019t know she was giving me advice. She helped me get past my mental block about not being respected as a writer, by raising the idea that her book was taught in colleges. In the end, I was mostly just stepping out on faith.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nio9: Getting back into the coursework, how far back in cinematic history are you planning to go?\n\nDue: I\u2019m going back very far. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll make students watch all of Birth of a Nation. But we\u2019ll definitely be touching on that as a jumping-off point for how Hollywood has a special responsibility for the proliferation of white supremacist imagery. It really does. And I think that really calls for a responsibility to come fix it. We can start with White Zombie, which is not a film about black people, but it\u2019s a film about black people and black magic.\n\nThere is a fantastic book called Horror Noir: Blacks in American Horror Films from the 1890s to Present by Dr. Robin R. Means Coleman, who teaches at the University of Michigan. This book is gold. I thought I was a horror head, but she goes so deep into it, just speaking my language. Everything she says I\u2019m just like, \u201cYes... that\u2019s exactly what I always thought.\u201d It\u2019s so nice to find a scholarly book that addresses what your friends have been talking about for years and just breaks it down. That is one of the underpinnings of the course, to bring the experience of being viewer and subject into an academic framework.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStarting with Birth of a Nation, I\u2019m planning to look at how fear of black otherness and black power were there from the start. Ingagi really helps introduce this fear and that was 1930. It has this notion of magic and a fascination with voodoo that became so Hollywood-ized. That fascination has continued, and it\u2019s not just in white-made films to be perfectly frank. But there\u2019s a difference, usually, in the rendering of it. Early Hollywood very much used this sort of fear-mongering. Either we were beast-like and scary and we had scary, magical ways that might harm them. Or, we were the comic relief and less brave, more cowardly.\n\n\n\nio9: Those tropes still pop up, maybe not as prevalently as they once did.\n\nDue: Oh yes. I had never watched a Mantan Moreland film before preparing for this course. I mentioned him in Lucky Ghost, but I want to include King of the Zombies, where it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s almost like a co-lead. The opening shot is two white actors and he\u2019s in the back\u2014the servant. But he\u2019s almost center framed. So he\u2019s one of the big draws for this movie, and he is hysterical. The man was a talent. There\u2019s no questioning it. But the stereotype was so toxic.\n\nIt\u2019s such a shame. You can see he was such a talented man, but he was a part of a system that was using him to aid and comfort white supremacy. This notion of cowardliness and all the child-like presentation, which really marked a lot of portrayals in those early Hollywood films. So we\u2019re going back to the beginning, and we\u2019re going to go through the Blaxploitation Era with Blacula, of course.\n\nYou know, that really holds up. I like Blacula. I am really thrilled with how well some of these films hold up. I was really thrilled with Blacula. I finally saw Ganja and Hess, which, for years, was very difficult to find but is now streaming on Amazon. It is amazing. Duane Jones from Night of the Living Dead also stars in Ganja and Hess in a very different, really powerful role.\n\nI really liked rewatching Rusty Cundieff\u2019s Tales from the Hood from the \u201990s. You go back and watch that now and it really resonates. Black-made horror tends to fall into categories of morality tale, which is what we have with Def By Temptation and some older ones in that vein. Or there\u2019s power and magic that again returns to voodoo hoodoo in slightly different ways, in the form of retribution horror. Tales from the Hood is definitely retribution horror.\n\nSome [other films] were just, \u201cHey, we\u2019re here.\u201d Nothing remarkable about the race of the characters, except they happen to be black. There was one from the Blaxploitation era called Abby. It was almost called Blacksorcist. They came this close to calling it Blacksorcist. It has some African themes in there. Often you\u2019ll see these filmmakers bringing in African themes to enable the explanation for the magic. It\u2019s got like a sex killing spree but it\u2019s mainly just trying to capitalize off the popularity of The Exorcist. That\u2019s all that really is about. I mean, they just sprinkle some African on it. But it\u2019s really just more, \u201clet\u2019s get some of that money...\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s really interesting to watch the difference between how black actors were used in horror movies made by white filmmakers, as opposed to what they do under their own power and direction. And that\u2019s great; don\u2019t get me wrong. For instance, the movie Son of Ingagi was made by a black filmmaker back in 1941. They called it Son of Ingagi I think to kind of counter the Ingagi movie, which was so exploitative and misappropriated voodoo. They kind of nod and pay homage to having a beast-creature in Son of Ingagi. But, more importantly, it was just showing black folks in daily life. This is a wedding, this is a well-kept home, these are well-spoken people, here\u2019s a lawyer. The lawyer is black, the police chief is black, everyone is black. And when you think about what images that we got to see of ourselves back in those days, even a relatively schlocky horror movie like Son of Ingagi becomes this cultural timepiece. It really makes you think, \u201cWow\u2026 it would have been refreshing to see black people acting with courage. And it would have been refreshing to see black people not in a subservient position to whites in a movie.\u201d In fact, there are no whites in that movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nio9: It\u2019s striking that it came out only a year after the first one.\n\n\n\nDue: Yeah. We\u2019ve been doing this kind of call-and-response since the beginning. Trying to define who we are and what we\u2019re like within their strictures. And of course there\u2019s a vast difference in production quality.\n\n\n\nio9: It\u2019s funny, you talking about Son of Ingagi brought back this personal memory. My grandfather was a Haitian folkloric choreographer of some note and acted in a movie called The Golden Mistress. I\u2019ve only seen it once. But he plays one of the village people, one of the guys who can speak English. There\u2019s treasure and they go to the island of Haiti, and he\u2019s the guy the white ship captain can talk to.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut he also plays a houngan [vodun priest] and wears a full face mask so you can\u2019t tell it\u2019s the same actor. And he wears, I think, a grass skirt and does a folkloric dance. On one hand, I\u2019m watching this like, \u201cWow, grandpa was kind of like a freakin\u2019 movie star?\u201d On the other hand, it\u2019s like \u201cgoddamn, they got him being a scary Other...\u201d It speaks to your point with Son of Ingagi: you get to see like a tiny little bit of authentic representation in the middle of an embarrassing film.\n\n\n\nDue: Yeah, it\u2019s like this little island of black agency. Or their idea of black authenticity. But it\u2019s a horror movie and there\u2019s some bad costumes in it and clearly, they had no budget.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nio9: What are the works that you\u2019ll use to show how portrayals changed?\n\n\n\nDue: I am going to show \u201cThe Space Traders\u201d from the old Cosmic Slop HBO sci-fi anthology, directed by Reggie Hudlin. Technically, that\u2019s one that veers into science fiction but the story is about a horrific choice.\n\nI kind of want to open with \u201cThe Comet\u201d by W.E.B. DuBois. It\u2019s an apocalyptic short story that I usually teach as science fiction, but it does kind of have a feeling of horror. He almost lovingly goes over the details of the bodies as they\u2019re splayed everywhere. He was writing horror from the heart. And, of course, what he\u2019s trying to counteract with that story is a different horror. This is the era of lynching and this is where the humanity of blacks is being questioned. When you write a story where everyone is dead except a black man and a white woman, they just have to become to people trying to survive for one little moment in time\u2026 that\u2019s a horror story. These are two very different artists in two very different times but DuBois\u2019 story is a great companion, in a way, to what Jordan Peele was doing with the black man and white woman in his movie.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nio9: They\u2019re tapping into this primal fear that America has always had.\n\n\n\nDue: Yeah, and they\u2019re trying to hold up a mirror for us to see what we\u2019re doing with our society. So, there were moments in the DuBois story where he\u2019s nervous about where he goes and how he\u2019s seen from the outside. It\u2019s similar to the opening of Get Out, being lost in a strange, white neighborhood. That\u2019s so real. Horror is a great way to address this awful, festering wound in the American psyche, the slavery and genocide that was present during our nation\u2019s birth. We has a nation have not been able to process it in a healthy way, or anything close to a healthy way.\n\n\n\nio9: And you\u2019re seeing the consequences of that in the present, almost hourly.\n\n\n\nDue: I knew it would get bad. But some things have happened much more quickly than I anticipated. I didn\u2019t expect to see Nazis marching in the street and the president going like, \u201cEh...\u201d I would have been really surprised if someone had come back in a time machine and told me that would be the case. It\u2019s like, \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious\u2014you mean a white woman got run over? Not a black woman, a white woman? Got mowed over by a car?\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cEh...\u201d Holy cow. That is worse than i thought, even. So, horror is really such a perfect way to express social evil through the energies and emotions of fictional characters.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI want to touch on George Romero for a moment, because we just lost him. I\u2019ve been a big fan, obviously and, after he died, there was this debate on Twitter on whether he was intentionally trying to implant social messages in Night of the Living Dead. The famous story is that it was pretty much colorblind casting and Duane Jones just had the best audition and that\u2019s the way it is. And people would just sort of close the book on that, almost angrily, like offended at that thought they might try to say something. I\u2019m going to say this: It\u2019s 1968. You have a black man in an alpha position in a story where he has hit a white woman and he\u2019s killing a bunch of white folks. At the end, he\u2019s shot down by a bunch of rednecks. Over the end credits, there are images of him being thrown on a woodpile by a group of rednecks. That imagery, whether it was conscious or unconscious, you can\u2019t deny the power of it. As Dr. Coleman points out in her book, black audiences saw the power of those images. Those kinds of images had not been addressed in a film at that time. The real horror is not zombies, the real horror is the social upheaval of the times. Romero went back to black male protagonists again and again. Hello, was that accidental?\n\n\n\nI might have one intention with what I write but once you read it, what it actually means is what it means to you. Art is in the eye of the beholder and I know what I\u2019m looking at when I watch Night of the Living Dead. I know how electrifying and unusual that is. So don\u2019t try to tell me what was intentional or whatever. Unconsciously, he was doing something and he brought it to consciousness.\n\n\n\nio9: Are there things that persist, that still bother you, with black representations in speculative fiction?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDue: Oh my God, yes. It still annoys me when one of the rare actors of color is colored in paint, for example. Really? There\u2019s the films that leave you out, and sometimes that\u2019s better, frankly. Many times I have turned to my husband in a movie theater and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t they just leave us out of this movie?\u201d Because now I\u2019m annoyed; before, I was having a good time. Especially when black characters are often not as three-dimensional as the white characters. If you have a lone person of color in a big, white cast, they\u2019re likely to be solitary. No friends or family to speak of. With a man, often no romance or a love interest.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s something that has been really persistent and really irritating is the desexualization of black men but the open readiness and availability of black women for white men. That\u2019s something that still persists to a degree. You do see strides, like This Is Us does do a really good job of blending its characters of color into a big ensemble series. That\u2019s because they have a diverse writing room. You know? And you can tell when a show has a diverse writing room and when they don\u2019t. Color has impact on us. You can\u2019t just paint a character black or brown. Even if you just get to the point of treating them like everyone else, which is better than it\u2019s been, there\u2019s more to it. Where\u2019s the richness of that experience?\n\n", "keywords": ["racism", "black", "really", "hes", "course", "movie", "thats", "white", "think", "im", "inspired", "horror", "college"], "polarity": 0.08256487765108456, "subjectivity": 0.45848717374579473},

Do black people own pearls? Aside from AKAs, I don\u2019t think so, so I will revise the previous sentence. Before you clutch your Jesus piece, allow me to elaborate.\n\nThere are definitely movies with more black characters or blacker themes (Friday, Do the Right Thing, Fruitvale Station, etc.), but Jordan Peele\u2019s keynote address to the Sundance Film Festival brought up the idea that perhaps no other mainstream film has so unapologetically exposed every facet of black people\u2019s perceptions of racism and of white people in general.\n\nAccording to Deadline, Peele gave the keynote address at the Sundance Film Festival Independent Forum on Sunday and addressed many of the themes of the film, digging in on how it differed from other mainstream films like 12 Years a Slave and Hidden Figures.\n\nPeele pointed out that the \u201cwhite savior\u201d complex that underlies many movies often gives white audiences an out because there is always a white savior who absolves them of racism. In their thinking, there has to be at least one good, nonracist white person for the audience to identify with.\n\nBut not in Get Out. \u201cRose subverts that,\u201d Peele said, speaking about the main antagonist of the movie, who masquerades as the protagonist through most of the film, adding, \u201cSometimes all white people are evil\u2014sometimes\u2014but not all the time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEvery white person in this movie is evil,\u201d he told the audience. The director explained that before this one hit theaters, he couldn\u2019t recall any mainstream movie that ends with the black character killing a white person\u2014much less a white woman.\n\nPeele said that he wanted to use the horror genre to address the post-racial lie of the Obama era while having black characters do things moviegoers wouldn\u2019t normally see on-screen in a scary movie. Instead of frantically waiting for death, Chris\u2014the main character\u2014was intent on escaping, as the name Get Out suggests.\n\nWhile the flick didn\u2019t compromise on how it treated its white characters, Peele also wanted to make sure that white watchers could relate. His single-shot opening made white audiences experience what it feels like to be in white spaces as a black person, while translating the anxiety black people know all too well. He sought a balance between \u201cwhat black audiences need\u201d and \u201cwhat white audiences will be watching.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlack people would recognize that fear\u2014it\u2019s part of the black identity and the horror of America. There are things we are cognizant of because we have to be,\u201d Peele explained. \u201cFor white audiences, they see how it is to be a black man in a suburban neighborhood at night.\u201d\n\nThe themes of the film, according to Peele, had less to do with the individual white characters in the movie and instead focused on the idea of how violence was inflicted on Chris and other black bodies for a singular purpose: to steal, appropriate and erase the talent and abilities of black people because of privilege and greed. \u201cThe system itself is the monster,\u201d Peele told the onlookers.\n\nWhile it may not be the blackest movie ever, I can\u2019t think of another movie that enjoyed as much mainstream success and left black people cheering at how real it was while white people simultaneously praised the movie because it was a good \u201canalogy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBesides Boo 2!

I have deliberated Miguel\u2019s stance and potential to do a tribute to the Artist Formerly Known As The Artist and Now Currently Known As Prince. As an entertainer, Miguel is there. As a musician\u2026eh. As a songwriter, YES! As a sly shady motherfucker\u2026hmmm. But it takes a God-given talent to be an excellent entertainer, songwriter, guitar shredder and a master of shade. Who else can almost knock the shit out of James Brown fans and still look cool doing it? NO ONE. It\u2019ll be another lifetime before we get another PRINCE NELSON ROGERS. \u2026but we\u2019ll settle for the next Lenny Kravitz.\n\nKeep Alicia Keys in her vocal range\n\nWe all remember when Alicia Keys had the gumption to sing Prince\u2019s \u201cAdore\u201d at the highest of heights from her shallow lungs. Sure, she did an admiral cover of \u201cHow Come U Don\u2019t Call Me?\u201d But this isn\u2019t the same Alicia Keys of 2001. Maybe she\u2019s been on vocal rest for the past four years. Yet, I still don\u2019t trust her falsetto. Give her something simple to sing like, \u201cSometimes It Snows In April.\u201d Place her ass behind the keyboard and tell her to keep still physically and vocally. There are only a few with the vocal dexterity of Prince, and Alicia isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nD\u2019Angelo, Maxwell and/or Bilal are mandatory\n\nSpeaking of vocal dexterity you absolutely have to include at least one of these singers. If you don\u2019t include D\u2019Angelo, Maxwell and/or Bilal, I\u2019ll reduce my cable package to just one channel. And that one channel would be TV One.\n\nMichael Eugene Archer on the guitar is a must. A funky number like \u201cBaby I\u2019m A Star,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Gonna B A Beautiful Night,\u201d \u201cControversy,\u201d \u201cThe Most Beautiful Girl In The World,\u201d \u201cAlphabet St.\u201d or his favorite \u201cMovie Star\u201d fits his musical narrative perfectly. Hell, let him do all six of these songs. Maxwell, of course, has to do a slow-burner. Songs like \u201cAdore,\u201d \u201cCall My Name,\u201d and \u201cDo Me Baby\u201d were written for his vocals. And Bilal. What other singer can capture the sadistic, quirky style of Prince? He would be perfect for \u201cThe Beautiful Ones\u201d or \u201cDarling Nikki.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA duet from Erykah Badu and Andre 3000\n\nHear me out. Go listen to Erykah Badu\u2019s \u201cHello\u201d off of her latest. Tell me you can\u2019t hear her and 3 Stacks singing \u201cDiamonds and Pearls\u201d together. Thank you!\n\nInclude the Wonderland squad\n\nEveryone knows Janelle Monae\u2019s musical aptitude and prolific performance capabilities as an entertainer. But it\u2019s her entire movement that resonates and reflects the legacy of Prince. The many talented people Prince put on spans from Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis to Tevin Campbell. Hell, even Janet Jackson owes Prince credit for the Minneapolis sound on Control and Rhythm Nation. Janelle Monae falls into the same category with her Wonderland crew, particularly Roman GianArthur. I had the pleasure of seeing him live twice. He embodies Prince in both style and musicianship, which is a rarity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInclude the OGs\n\nI\u2019ve listed all of the new schoolers, but we have to mention the old school. It is mandatory that you include Morris Day & The Time, Shelia E. and Wendy and Lisa. These artists worked with him during his prime and literally played an instrumental role in developing the Prince sound of the 80s. It\u2019s blasphemous and disrespectful not to mention their contributions to the Minneapolis sound. Besides, I really want to see Jerome get Morris\u2019 mirror one good time before he lives this earth. Stay strong Jerome\u2026stay strong!\n\nWho should sing Purple Rain?\n\nThis one is complicated. It\u2019s a classic. It really shouldn\u2019t be touched. Yet, it really isn\u2019t a Prince tribute without \u201cPurple Rain.\u201d I mean, no one can really do this song any justice. Not even Patti LaYelle. No disrespect. (Shout out to PattiLaHelle for the reference.) Sure Fanatasia and Jennifer Hudson have the vocal fortitude to carry it. But will they overdo it? And what about the guitar solo? This is why I say choose either one of these singers. Let Lenny Kravitz start it. Add Fantasia or J Hud (not both) to sing the second part. Finally, let Lenny rip the guitar to shreds. It\u2019s the only way our ears can survive a non-karaoke/karaoke version of \u201cPurple Rain.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know this sounds more like a concert instead of a 20 to 30-minute tribute. And you\u2019re right. This is how much of an impact the musical genius that is Prince has had. So, if the BET Awards starts to look more like a concert in honor of Prince, we wouldn\u2019t mind\u2026at all\n\n(Also, here's another take on a dream tribute guest list that would have been much better than the tribute we shall never speak of again.)\n\nCypress Moss is what peak Negritude looks like.

The arrival of the country\u2019s first black president was an occasion to champion the achievements of today\u2019s African-Americans heroes\u2014achievements that could exist only in our ancestors\u2019 wildest dreams.\n\n\n\nBut this year, in a political and cultural climate that has grown bleaker and more ominous, honoring the best and brightest of black America has become a revolutionary act, a form of resistance against the rising tide of teeming hordes who insist that this country\u2014a country that was built on the backs and blood of others\u2014belongs to them and them alone.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo those teeming hordes, we say, \u201cNah.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe honorees on this year\u2019s list are a reminder to this nation that we have always been a part of everything that makes America great. That black brilliance has touched and shaped all facets of American society\u2014in entertainment, the arts, sports, media, politics, business, and science and technology. That black activists have had to drag this country, kicking and screaming all the way, into living up to the promises of freedom and justice set forth by the country\u2019s Founding Fathers.\n\nAnd so it remains today.\n\nThese 100 honorees\u2014culled from a list of hundreds\u2014in all ways, big and small, are moving this country, kicking and screaming all the way, to even greater heights.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo. 1 on our list this year is director and writer Jordan Peele, whose film, Get Out, brilliantly captured the horror of living while black in America.\n\nBy depicting a world in which white people are literally stealing black bodies for their own enjoyment, Peele\u2014who completely flipped the script on the predictable tropes of the horror-film genre\u2014exposed how white liberalism is just as complicit in the destruction of black people as those who commit state-sanctioned violence on black bodies every day.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the No. 2 slot is Solange Knowles, who released one of the most political albums of the year with A Seat at the Table. The album is packed with R&B songs\u2014like \u201cDon\u2019t Touch My Hair\u201d and \u201cF.U.B.U.\u201d\u2014that sonically whisper; yet beneath those graceful notes are politically potent lyrics that roar with a sense of empowerment, independence and identity.\n\nThe album peaked at No. 1 on the music charts, which put Solange and big sis Beyonc\u00e9 (who is also on the list at No. 11) in the rarefied class of siblings who have had No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200 chart in the same calendar year.\n\n\n\nIn a year in which the media has been perpetually under siege, we also pay tribute to the black journalists and commentators who fearlessly continue to speak truth to power: journalists like Yamiche Alcindor (13), who covers politics and social justice for the New York Times; Angela Rye (19), whose biting political commentary on CNN has left a river of conservative white tears in its wake; the dynamic duo of Ta-Nehisi Coates (5) and Vann R. Newkirk II (65), who use their platforms at The Atlantic to challenge those in power who are only interested in maintaining white supremacy; Nikole Hannah-Jones (50), who co-founded an organization to ensure that the next generation of investigative journalists includes people of color; and Wesley Lowery (87), whose award-winning book detailing the uprising in Ferguson, Mo., is being developed into a television series.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe would be remiss if we did not give praise to the creative geniuses behind Moonlight, the Academy Awards\u2019 best picture of the year. Director Barry Jenkins (3) and screenwriter Tarell Alvin McCraney (15)\u2014who both won Oscars for best adapted screenplay based on McCraney\u2019s play, In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue\u2014along with heartfelt performances by actors Trevante Rhodes (43) and Andr\u00e9 Holland (74), delivered a coming-of-age tale that deeply touched our souls, while cinematographer Bradford Young (21) and film editor Joi McMillon (49) both made history with Academy Award nominations in their respective fields.\n\n\n\nSome of the sports figures on our list shouldn\u2019t be too surprising: Golden State Warriors Kevin Durant (24) and Stephen Curry (26), who took down LeBron James\u2019 (35) Cleveland Cavaliers in an NBA Finals for the ages. But for a second year in a row, we\u2019ve included Colin Kaepernick (17) because he sacrificed his livelihood while simply demanding equal justice for black people. His act served as inspiration for brothers Michael and Martellus Bennett (45 and 55, respectively), who\u2019ve assumed the mantle of Kaepernick\u2019s cause, which continues to spread like a wildfire through the NFL.\n\nOthers on our list include S. Lee Merritt (8), who has become the \u201cpeople\u2019s lawyer\u201d by representing victims of police brutality; Bozoma Saint John (10), who has been charged with rehabilitating the toxic image of ride-hailing firm Uber; activist Tamika D. Mallory (22), who was co-president of the Women\u2019s March; and Zakiyyah Myers (47) and Rohan Gilkes (48), who not only called out Airbnb for failing to protect travelers of color, but also co-founded Innclusive, to give those travelers a safe haven.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the world of politics, there\u2019s Stacey Abrams (16), who hopes to become the first black female governor in America; Tito H. Jackson (84), who is trying to become Boston\u2019s first black mayor; and Stockton, Calif., Mayor Michael Tubbs (57), the city\u2019s youngest and first African-American mayor in its 167-year history.\n\nIn technology, Chrissa McFarlane (90), the founder of an Atlanta-based startup that protects medical records, raised $7.2 million for her company in three days.\n\nThese are just a sample of the leaders, the innovators and the game changers who made a difference over the past year.

Originally coined by Nathan Rabin, it's defined as \"that bubbly, shallow cinematic creature that exists solely in the fevered imaginations of sensitive writer-directors to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures.\" Basically, think of every character Zooey Deschanel has ever played.\n\nAs ubiquitous as this character type is, though, it doesn't seem to include Black women. More specifically, when this character is spoken of and/or cited, White women are named almost exclusively. Wiki lists 17 cinematic examples of them; Jamie Loftus at BDCWire lists 15; The AV Club 16; and Flavorwire\u2026too many to count. Dozens of binders full of quirky, awkward, and super cute White women. And no Black women. Because while Black women can be strong and sexy and strong and sultry and strong and strong, they apparently can't be sweet and silly and fun and girly and cute and free.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we know that's bullshit. Because we know these women, these \"Free Black Girls\" who are a bit quirkier, a bit stranger, a bit more eccentric, and a bit more idiosyncratic than most. Who exist outside the usual sphere of expectation for \"how Black women should be\" and seem to live unconstrained. Who were natural before being natural was cool. Who will shade and side eye you for speaking recklessly\u2026and then have a very serious conversation with a squirrel. Who own so much property in Gives-No-Fucks-Ville that they're leasing land to other people. Who everyone \u2014 men and women; straight and gay \u2014 crushes on.\n\nAnd while they do exist on screen, I prefer to cite some real life examples.\n\nLisa Bonet\n\nAlthough she was labeled a wild child when younger, history will continue to look favorably on her.

And where can I meet her???\" after watching the \"Caught Out There\" video the first time. And, if your hand is up, choke yourself, because you're lying.\n\nCree Summer\n\nIt's unfortunate there's an entire generation of young Black folks who only know Cree Summer because of Kanye's line in \"Spaceship.\" Because every generation of young Black folks need to know about Cree Summer. Perhaps a flag with her face should replace every Confederate flag. I mean, she is a part of our heritage. And our ancestors fought and died to defend her.

Like, we may have to come up with a concept stronger than #Goals to explain how we feel about her.\n\n\n\nWhen the 17-year-old shining star stepped on that SAG Awards red carpet, we collectively gasped\u2014and haven\u2019t taken a breath since. She snatched every one of our wigs that night, from her full, flowing mane and face glossed by Chanel all the way to the trailing train of her custom Ralph Lauren jumpsuit. And we can\u2019t forget to mention the exaggerated back bow detail that added the perfect touch of whimsy to an otherwise sophisticated silhouette. Every single thing was right about that look.\n\nPersonally, I just had to know the details of her beyond-glam makeup and to-the-heavens hair. After a little cyber searching, I came across the two boss babes responsible for Yara\u2019s carpet-crushing hair and makeup.

Represented by Exclusive Artists Management, this celebrity hairstylist is a master, whether working with wigs and extensions, braided works of art or textured tresses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith all of this talent, Johnson is more than just a hair expert. She has often spoken up in support of female-focused platforms, as well as addressing some of the pressures put on black women to alter their hair for cultural approval. For this mother of two daughters\u2014one who has decided to keep her hair natural and another with a relaxer\u2014the priority is on healthy hair and a woman\u2019s right to choose and not feel pressured to conform. Her focus is healthy hair, in whatever form that means for any woman she is working with.\n\nTo achieve Yara\u2019s showstopping look last Sunday, Johnson used products from natural-hair-care maven Taliah Waajid. Johnson says: \u201cThe inspiration was glamorous Diana Ross. I wanted her beautiful texture delicately brushed out.\u201d\n\nJohnson graciously gave us a detailed step-by-step on how she created Yara\u2019s blown-out brown bombshell style for the SAG Awards:\n\nSaturate damp hair from root to tip with the Taliah Waajid Green Apple and Aloe Nutrition Leave-In Conditioner. Brush hair thoroughly with a boar-bristle brush to evenly distribute the product. Dry hair with a diffuser. Add a quarter size of Taliah Waajid Curly Curl Cream to define curls and add shine.

At the entrance into the concrete jungle sat the blue Lexus LC 500 used during the film, with slashes from the Black Panther across its hood. Inside the purple-lit studio, seven stunning models posed in bespoke couture designs while standing on a moss-covered stage.

Mingling with guests and posing with the models inspired by their characters, the stars lit up the venue, taking laps around the stage and selfies with guests who dined on Wakanda Patties, made of chickpea and roast yam, and Cricket Tarts, made of chocolate-roasted crickets.

Given the feats of everyone from James Baldwin and Billie Holiday to Ta-Nehisi Coates and Toni Morrison, the need to validate black stories becomes downright baffling.\n\nThe debut Saturday on HBO of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, backed by and starring Oprah Winfrey, speaks to this conundrum: While Winfrey is a media giant and perhaps, along with Shonda Rhimes, the most powerful woman of color in media, it was white journalist Rebecca Skloot\u2019s version of Lacks\u2019 exploitation that became a best-selling book\u2014not the one written in 2008 by PEN Oakland award-winning African-American writer Harriet Washington (Medical Apartheid), whose work also won a National Book Critics Circle Award.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSkloot\u2019s well-meaning and best-selling attempt to tell the story of Lacks, a black woman whose death from cancer also led to the use of those defiantly persistent cancerous cells for medical breakthroughs, still leaves The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, as Ta-Nehisi Coates points out, lacking.\n\nYes, most everything Winfrey touches turns to gold, so the small-screen version of the book may also prove successful. In addition, if you consider the financial successes of the hip-hop musical Hamilton, the horror flick Get Out, and Lynn Nottage\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning play, and Tony Award contender, Sweat, the disconnection of the value of black stories to the universal narrative seems inexplicable.\n\nWhile all of these stories, with the exception of Hamilton, can be considered \u201cblack\u201d stories, their collective impressive successes with nonblack audiences indicate that they resonate with a wide range of audiences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a Northwestern University professor who researches, teaches and publishes on minority art, I have found that minority voices often tend to tell richer and more inclusive stories.\n\nIn Physics of Blackness, I write that rather than being \u201cniche,\u201d the best minority art shows how we are all webbed together, in both nuanced and obvious ways.\n\nNottage\u2019s Sweat has been astounding critics with its prescient understanding of the economic forces that led not only to the rise of Donald Trump but also to the current complexity of our sociopolitical\u2014and multicultural\u2014landscape. Whereas many pundits and politicians have incorrectly focused on working-class white men as the central actors in the recession, Sweat demonstrates that the economy actually connects all of us even as it seems to drive us apart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorks like Sweat correct, I hope, the many ways that black bodies are misused by white artists, in which the complexity of our humanity is frozen into a simple symbolism of victimization, and we are meant to be pitied, perhaps wept over, but always viewed, somehow, as \u201cother.\u201d\n\nFor example, Dana Schutz\u2019s recent submission for the Whitney Biennial, Open Casket\u2014a painting based on the open-casket photograph of Emmett Till\u2014says more about racial blindness and white privilege than the racial story of the United States.\n\n\n\nIn both the book The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks and Open Casket, the black body is a corpse, a tool for an argument being made by the white auteur.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn contrast, Hamilton imparts an incredibly complex history of the formation of the United States, embracing racial and gendered issues and all of their paradoxes.\n\nTo be sure, Hamilton does not tell everyone\u2019s story when it comes to the U.S. colonial history\u2014most painfully and ironically, that of the Native Americans; and yet, despite its flaws, what Hamilton forcefully argues is that the story of this nation cannot be told today without a central minority presence, as seemingly counterintuitive as that seems.\n\nIn his 1926 essay \u201cThe Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain,\u201d Langston Hughes wrote: \u201cWe younger Negro artists who create now intend to express our individual dark-skinned selves without fear or shame. If white people are pleased we are glad. If they are not, it doesn\u2019t matter. We know we are beautiful. And ugly too.\u201d How stunning that nearly a century later, those words must still stand as our battle cry against an establishment that continues to question our ability to tell our stories\u2014and, really, the stories of this nation.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff.\n\nMichelle M.

I forgot exactly what he said and how he said it, but I remember being reminded of exactly how young he is, and how surprised I was by that. He's been in the public consciousness for over two decades now; long enough to have several popular stand-up performances, 26 (!) credited film and movie roles, an iconic sketch show, perhaps the best block party ever, and a decade-long sabbatical from the public eye. I assumed that he was nearing or perhaps even past 50. But he's 43 years old; just five years older than me.\n\nUndoubtedly, my assumptions were also influenced by Chappelle's signature laconicness. Even when younger, he carried himself, moved, and spoke with the slyness of someone who's been here before. Who's seen everything there is to be seen, and mines his humor from the absurdity and the silliness of the human condition. If Chris Rock was the fiery and profane academic, Chappelle was the perpetually bemused and occasionally inappropriate homeboy.\n\nAnd perhaps this juxtaposition of his actual age and his decades-long celebrity status is why, after watching his special, Chappelle today feels like such an anachronism. This, by the way, doesn't mean that his special wasn't funny. Because it was. But I couldn't help but wonder why, when releasing his first concert special in 12 years \u2014 and releasing said special during a time rife with an ever-growing morass of racial and political context to lend his signature insights to \u2014 he'd devote the longest and most ambitious bits of his act to rape, O.J. Simpson, Bill Cosby, and trans people. Perhaps he intended to tackle those subjects as a challenge; attempting to find the humor in content most other comedians would consider radioactive. But maybe he recognizes himself as someone whose time has passed while other, younger comedians have taken his place. And perhaps he's aware he might be regarded that way, and is pissed about it, and choosing to delve into those topics is a middle finger to 2017. Maybe the world has moved on, but he hasn't.\n\nIf this is true, his bizarre and one-sided feud with Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele makes more sense. But it being (somewhat) understandable doesn't make it right. The source of his acrimony seems to stem from Key & Peele debuting on Comedy Central seven years after The Chappelle Show ended. As Chappelle recently stated in an interview with CBS This Morning, he (rightly) believes he helped pave the way for their success. And this bothers him.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I watch \u2018Key & Peele\u2019 and I see they\u2019re doing a format that I created, and at the end of the show, it says, \u2018Created by Key & Peele,\u2019 that hurts my feelings.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also alludes to this during his comedy special, joking that he's forced to (paraphrasing) \"fucking watch Key & Peele do my show every week.\" Of course, there are several obvious parallels between the two. Particularly in regard to the focus on race and racism. But how they treat and tackle race is where they're most divergent.\n\nLike his stand-up, Chappelle's race humor came from a preternaturally confident understanding of how the world really works and his place in it. He tells it like it is, even if its uncomfortable to hear. Especially if it's uncomfortable to hear. His infamous weed habit, in this context, is a self-medicating way of dealing with the humor and the harshness of reality. Key & Peele, however, mine much of their race humor from the insecurity of questioning their place in the world. It's not a shame of Blackness; it's a perpetual wondering if their backgrounds and personalities cultivate doubts of their authenticity, and finding the humor in their attempts to quell that (mostly) non-existent intra-racial cynicism. The Chappelle Show dealt with what was happening in the world. Key & Peele dealt with what was happening in their own heads.\n\nNo skit better exemplifies this internal pressure to perform Blackness than \"Soul Food\" \u2014 which also happened to be the first Key & Peele bit I'd ever seen. Chappelle would never, ever, ever do something like this, because it just wasn't and isn't a part of his relationship with the world and with being Black. (This, btw, doesn't make Key & Peele or their comedy any less Black than Chappelle's. It's just covering the same cavernous and limitless topic from a different perspective.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even if we go back to the similarities between the shows, Dave Chappelle's gripes still don't hold much water. Yes, he definitely came before them and presumably made their path much easier. Just as The Chris Rock Show came before Chappelle. And Robert Townsend and His Partners in Crime came before The Chris Rock Show. And In Living Color came before Robert Townsend and His Partners in Crime. And The Richard Pryor Show came before In Living Color. And while I'm sure Chappelle appreciated each of his forebearers, I don't recall any of them receiving executive producer credits for his show.\n\nUltimately, it seems like what Dave Chappelle wants is for it to be 2005 again. But he didn't even want it to be 2005 when it was 2005 \u2014 choosing to walk away at the peak of his fame \u2014 so why should we?", "keywords": ["world", "special", "peele", "key", "dave", "chappelle", "humor", "exactly", "hes", "way", "does", "race", "came"], "polarity": 0.08916856952571238, "subjectivity": 0.47318138210995353},

We saw now-President Donald Trump making his way to executive power through sheer racist, sexist vitriol. We witnessed the continued state of institutional violence against black bodies, such as those of Korryn Gaines, Keith Lamont Scott and Terence Crutcher. Black people saw the deaths of many beloved celebrities, like legends Prince and Muhammad Ali.\n\nIt was apparent that now more than ever, we needed something that spoke to our experiences, even if that outlet was in the form of a fictional film representation. But Get Out also spotlighted a pervasive problem in this country: \u201cNice\u201d racism and white liberalism are never to be trusted.\n\nIn October 2016, Get Out released its official trailer of only two minutes and 33 seconds, and took the world by storm. Although I didn\u2019t know the specifics, here is what I knew: The movie involved a black man (Chris), a possibly \u201cprogressive\u201d white woman (Rose Armitage) and, for the first time I could remember, a black man publicly showing just how frightening it can be to trust white America.\n\nFar from a perfect film\u2014one even arguably rooted in the respectable nature of how black people should operate in a white society until it\u2019s life or death\u2014Get Out does resonate on several levels. It highlights the very real consequences of attaching niceness to racism\u2014or, as Ta-Nehisi Coates calls it, \u201cthe good, racist people,\u201d and it depicts the dangers of being beholden to white liberalism. What\u2019s more, Get Out allows black people to win against white people\u2014and it did it during Black History Month, no less.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGet Out also underscores the distrust that black people feel for white women\u2014the same white women who voted for Trump (53 percent), and the same white women whom Angela Peoples warned us about in her viral \u201cDon\u2019t Forget: White Women Voted for Trump\u201d photo at the Women\u2019s March on Washington in January.\n\nBut the movie doesn\u2019t just enable black people to see conservatives for who they are and who we\u2019ve always known them to be. Rather, it provides a means to evaluate the demons contained in the nice racism of those who believe that they do good (and who make it a point to distance themselves from what is perceived as bad): white progressives and liberals.\n\nIn his feature-film directorial debut, Jordan Peele takes us on a suspenseful, comedic adventure. In the beginning we hear \u201cSikiliza Kwa Wahenga,\u201d Swahili for \u201cListen to ancestors \u2026 run away\u201d\u2014a hidden message in the context of the story. The words are literally issuing a warning, and as the movie continues, we understand just why the main character, Chris, played by Daniel Kaluuya, should have listened.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve seen Get Out twice, and I\u2019m still mentally unpacking the experience. It\u2019s a film deeply rooted in expressing what can happen when you place your trust in white people and, by extension, white America. What reverberated for me as I watched the film is the idea of white people wanting to be black, desiring to be black in an obsessive way, and the fetishizing of black bodies. There is a deep connection to slavery, particularly with the \u201cbingo\u201d auction block where control of Chris\u2019 body is sold off. There is also a numbness associated with being black when white people attempt to control our bodies (\u201csunken place\u201d), and an infatuation with anything deemed to be more powerful.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s also clear that Get Out presents yet another example of how nice white people assume that they are complimenting black people on aesthetics and athleticism, but don\u2019t realize how deeply connected those faux compliments are to racism. There was a time when white people and faulty science believed that black people were better athletes because of extra tendons.\n\n\n\nWhile watching Get Out, I couldn\u2019t help thinking about the long, jealous, bitter historical implications behind Granddad Armitage losing to Jesse Owens (\u201cHe almost got over [losing to him]\u201d) and how that became the impetus for taking over black people\u2019s bodies. Get Out connected historical themes to contemporary times to make the point about just how envious white people can be of black people. We are indeed the mules of the world\u2014used by other communities of color to fight for their rights while simultaneously being silenced by white conservatives and liberals alike. It is a film that allows black people to be rightfully afraid and untrusting of white people.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMake no mistake: Get Out isn\u2019t merely a fictional film, but one with themes that we can see play out historically and currently. It makes clear that black people can be beholden to white people who are seemingly nice. It\u2019s that same false kindness that allowed many of us to be shocked when Hillary Clinton was heard referring to black people as \u201csuperpredators\u201d in 1996. It\u2019s that same \u201cniceness\u201d that had many black people surprised when then-President Bill Clinton signed the 1994 crime bill into law\u2014which was authored by everyone\u2019s favorite white cookout invitee, then-Sen. Joe Biden. And, in that same line of thought, it was that same trust of white liberals that caused many of us to be horrified when Biden railroaded Anita Hill during her testimony against then-Supreme Court Justice nominee Clarence Thomas in 1991 about allegations of sexual harassment.\n\nGet Out is par for the course when it comes to \u201cnice\u201d white treatment of black people. It also implicitly addresses the distrust black people often have for one another because of brainwashing. At the Armitage estate, we see that the only time Chris begins to feel more comfortable is when he sees two other black people\u2014Walter and Georgina. He quickly realizes, though, that something is amiss and that they are nearly in sync with the Armitages. Get Out critically examines the problems of aligning with whiteness and how white supremacy can be used to divide black people.\n\n\n\nBlack people need this film\u2014it\u2019s powerful and beautifully nuanced, and in the end, we survive. But until white people hold themselves accountable for their \u201cnice\u201d racism and the impact it has on those they claim to help, they will continue to believe that black people owe them a statement heard twice in Get Out: \u201cYou\u2019re right; I\u2019m wrong.\u201d And that means they will have learned nothing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPreston Mitchum is a Washington, D.C.-based writer, activist and policy nerd.

Recently launched by Oronike Odeleye and Kenyette Barnes, the campaign\u2019s intent is to finally shove R. Kelly out of the music industry because of a long history of abuse, from past allegations of pedophilia, sexual assault, and battery to newer, equally disturbing accusations of violence. Williams herself has long reported on R. Kelly\u2019s misdeeds throughout the years and has never shied away from expressing her disdain of the singer, so one would assume she would align with such a crusade.\n\nHowever, when the campaign was discussed during her Hot Topics segment, Williams was rather dismissive. \u201cWhat is this, 10 years too late?\u201d Williams told the audience. \u201cIt\u2019s not gonna work. Black people aren\u2019t really good at protesting. Not since the King march.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a fan of the show, I have learned to build a high tolerance for opinions that ought to be soaked in bleach and left to air-dry near a Google search bar. Amnesia about recent political movements like Black Lives Matter notwithstanding, #MuteRKelly can already claim success after reportedly inspiring the cancellation of six of Kelly\u2019s concerts in eight cities. As #MeToo creator Tarana Burke explained on a recent episode of Comedy Central\u2019s The Opposition with Jordan Keppler about Kelly: \u201cJust like the Harvey Weinsteins of the world, he\u2019s a sexual predator, and he\u2019s been preying on black and brown girls for 20 years.\u201d\n\nMany of R. Kelly\u2019s detractors have complained year after year about his continued success and adulation in the face of such history\u2014largely because of the type of victims he\u2019s chosen, but also because of the times in which he\u2019s lived. In just a few months, the world has changed: We are a far cry from the days when R. Kelly could marry a teenage Aaliyah without a public fuss. #MuteRKelly is an attempt to right these wrongs.\n\nIt is black women doing that we all should be doing. So it should not be undermined by, of all people, another black woman. And Williams is not the only famous black woman still excusing him\u2014or even publicly exalting him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are not one, but three photos currently on Lil\u2019 Kim\u2019s Instagram account of her in the studio with R. Kelly. She appears giddy, but many of her fans are rightfully frustrated. \u201cHe\u2019s a pedophile. How could anyone work with him?\u201d one user asks. Another writes, \u201cWait are we gonna forget that he pissed on a underaged girl? Wait what??\u201d\n\nOn the final date of their sold out arena tour, Xscape brought R. Kelly out on stage. Several members have daughters, and on a recent episode of The Real Housewives of Atlanta, Kandi Burruss took part in an anti-domestic violence PSA organized by her co-star Kenya Moore. Why shoot that and then allow this shit to happen?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s talk about Jhen\u00e9 Aiko while we\u2019re at it. She has a duet with R. Kelly (2015's \u201cLet\u2019s Make Some Noise\u201d) and appears alongside Kelly on a recent Chris Brown track called \u201cJuicy Booty.\u201d I think of tranquility and good weed when I think of her, not complicity.\n\nLast year, I wrote about how sexism and racism within the music industry might compel some black female singers to join an R. Kelly tour bill. It remains a pity that a man like R. Kelly can continue to enjoy sizable support despite decades of being accused of sexual predatory behavior while talented women with less tawdry histories have to defer to and depend on him for visibility and money.\n\nThat was never an excuse for anyone who makes such a choice, but Lil\u2019 Kim and Xscape are far less vulnerable than those singers. Xscape had an all-female bill and sold out arenas across the country despite not having released an album in nearly 20 years. They made a willful choice to put that man on stage. It was the wrong one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same goes for Lil\u2019 Kim. She is not far removed from the well-received Bad Boy Reunion Tour; has the likes of Beyonc\u00e9 dressing up as her for Halloween; has Remy Ma sampling her old hits to get radio airplay in this decade; and continues to enjoy a dedicated fan base that will pay to see her no matter the venue. And as a legend widely revered by artists of all genres, there are many people Lil\u2019 Kim could call for studio time. So it is a pity that she hasn\u2019t blocked R. Kelly\u2019s number already.\n\nI\u2019m not surprised when the likes of Chris Brown continue to work with R. Kelly, but I am perplexed when Xscape and Lil\u2019 Kim and Jhen\u00e9 Aiko still do. I\u2019ve long questioned men who support other men accused of predatory behavior, but evidently, there are women whose choices warrant similar inquiries.\n\nI don\u2019t care how much folks enjoy 12 Play and The Chocolate Factory. In 2018, it\u2019s fuck R. Kelly forever. I don\u2019t know if we can ever truly rid ourselves of Pissy considering we exist in a celebrity-driven news market with an insatiable craving for content, but there is certainly a way to minimize R. Kelly as much as possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can stop inviting him to award shows. We can stop playing him on the radio. We can stop allowing him to be booked in big arenas; we can let his peeing ass perform in some miserable somebody\u2019s backyard or preferred circle of hell instead. We can stop allowing him space on our sold-out arena tours. We can cut those studio sessions out of the budget. We can stop doing any single thing that allows him to keep thinking he\u2019s invincible and above reproach.\n\nEveryone who cares about black women and girls, consent, and autonomy should be down for that cause.

The #MeToo founder has been rightfully getting her shine since the movement bearing the name she coined caught Hollywood\u2019s attention last fall. In the months since, she has appeared on red carpets, been honored in Time magazine, and become a regular on the talk and news show circuits.\n\nBut amid all the fanfare, the one thing Burke has never neglected is her mission to support and protect black and brown girls and women, a point she made abundantly clear when she appeared on Comedy Central\u2019s The Opposition With Jordan Klepper on Thursday\u2014her segment begins at the 15:31 mark.\n\n\u201cWe started #MeToo because it was an exchange of empathy between survivors, to let them know that they\u2019re not alone,\u201d she said.\n\nSince Klepper\u2019s show is satirical, he naturally played devil\u2019s advocate when discussing the need and motives of #MeToo, voicing the increasingly irrational concerns of men who likely feel that the movement endangers their right to sexual entitlement. When asked by Klepper about the danger of conflating sexual harassment and assault under the umbrella of a single hashtag, Burke illustrated the larger danger of ignoring the insidious nature of sexual harassment:\n\nThere\u2019s no conflation; there\u2019s actually a spectrum. And so, sexual harassment and sexual abuse and sexual violence are on a spectrum. On one end, we have sexual harassment, which creates hostile environments and make people uncomfortable and really open a gateway for more intense violence. So they can all live under the same hashtag.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe went on to point out that #MeToo\u2019s actual mission is \u201cempowerment through empathy\u201d\u2014a mission that we share here at The Glow Up. When Klepper playfully quipped that he thought empathy to be synonymous with weakness, Burke very seriously replied:\n\nEmpathy is actually the opposite of weakness; it is the power between two people. ... When one person says to another person, \u201cMe too,\u201d that person has shared something about a trauma that they experienced. The other person is empowered by that; it\u2019s the power in knowing that you\u2019re not alone, it\u2019s the power in knowing that somebody believes you, and hears you, and sees you, and is there for you.\n\nBut ever the comedian, Klepper wasn\u2019t done, ribbing Burke on why she continues to fix her social media gaze upon alleged serial sexual abuser and pedophile R. Kelly. Through Klepper\u2019s satirical lens, Kelly\u2019s only relevance should be related to his record releases. Burke coolly responded with the clapback of the night: \u201cYou know what else he hasn\u2019t released? The women that he\u2019s holding captive in houses in Atlanta and Chicago.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I tell you that I stood up and applauded and whooped with the studio audience! And as always, Burke brought the movement back to black and brown girls and their specific vulnerability\u2014and invisibility\u2014in discussions of sexual abuse.\n\n[P]eople tend to not care about things that affect the most marginalized amongst us. [Kelly\u2019s] victims, the people who he seeks out are vulnerable girls who come from vulnerable communities, and they look like me, mostly. ... [N]ow\u2014largely because of this movement\u2014we are bringing more attention to people like R. Kelly and hoping that we can take him down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll in all, in our current era of catchphrases, memes and passing trends, Burke\u2019s appearance on The Opposition was a cogent reminder that our collective work must continue, even\u2014no, especially\u2014amid all the well-deserved attention. She also made sure that The Opposition\u2019s audience left knowing that #MeToo is far more than a hashtag:\n\n\u201cThe #MeToo movement is here to stay,\u201d said Burke.", "keywords": ["harassment", "sexual", "tarana", "burke", "klepper", "knowing", "metoo", "keeps", "movement", "person", "keeper", "mission", "sisters", "power", "focused"], "polarity": 0.14142149003260113, "subjectivity": 0.49962408990186763},

Years before her success as a television host, she dominated New York City radio as a shock jock obsessed with celebrity gossip and provocative chitchat.\n\nShe spat vitriol that scathed her targets and caused many of them to retaliate, most notably Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs back in 1998, after she spread rumors that he was gay. The hip-hop mogul flexed his influence so hard, Williams was blackballed in her industry, bringing her career to a full stop for a number of years. But it was as clear then as it is today that she gives zero fucks about what rolls off her tongue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of this #MeToo movement,\u201d she said during her show\u2019s \u201cHot Topics\u201d segment. \u201cI love that people are speaking up for the first time and coming out and everything, but now it\u2019s got\u2014I look at all men like, \u2018You\u2019re a #MeToo.\u2019 All of them. All of them, which is not fair.\u201d\n\nAnd in response to the recent #MuteRKelly campaign, Williams had this to say: \u201cWhat is this, 10 years too late? It\u2019s not going to work. Black people aren\u2019t really good at protesting. Not since the King march ... R. Kelly wasn\u2019t a \u2018me too.\u2019 Aaliyah voluntarily married him when she was 15 years old. Her parents voluntarily let her do it.\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019 recent comments in response to the #MeToo and #MuteRKelly campaigns are, in my opinion, her most vile and disgusting to date. Not only did she de-emphasize the activists\u2019 initiative to aggressively protest at R. Kelly performances (at whatever point in time), but she argued on the crooner\u2019s behalf. Williams basically absolved Kelly, co-signed his statutory conduct and lambasted the young women who were linked to him.\n\n\n\nHer level of victim-blaming is both disturbing and reckless. Williams chided late songstress Aaliyah\u2014and, inaccurately, her parents\u2014for consenting to marriage with the R&B pervert. She also claimed that the teen girls who are currently part of Kelly\u2019s harem are willing participants\u2014and faulted their parents for that, too. And perhaps worst of all, the host also told her viewers that the 13-year-old girl allegedly featured in Kelly\u2019s sex tape\u2014whom he purportedly urinated on\u2014\u201cwas down with it.\u201d All because Williams is \u201csick of the #MeToo movement.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrankly, I am sick of Wendy Williams.\n\nWilliams\u2019 statements and defense of R. Kelly are a slap in the face to female survivors of sexual abuse, vulnerable girls and the movements that advocate for them. She is one of many black women whose thinking is so patriarchal, they engage in a brand of misogynoir that is not only foul AF, but downright dangerous.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s internalized racism and internalized misogyny,\u201d Stacey Patton told The Glow Up. Patton is assistant professor of multimedia journalism at Morgan State University and the author of Spare the Kids: Why Whupping Children Won\u2019t Save Black America. She said:\n\nThere\u2019s a long tradition of this, deeply tied to the history of slavery and racism. One of the core features of the racialization of black bodies is to create this narrative that they\u2019re sexual deviants. Black [women] have participated in that discourse, softly believing that if they adhere to rules about what it means to be a virtuous woman, that somehow it makes us more acceptable to society. So we can\u2019t, even in our imagination, believe young black girls can be victimized in this way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams\u2019 narrative reeks of toxic femininity. In many black communities and households alike, young girls are emotionally victimized\u2014largely by women, long before they encounter men. They are unfairly sexualized according to their attitudes, bodies and mannerisms. Some of us may be familiar with the term \u201cacting womanish\u201d being directed at black girls. For those who are not, Dorothy Randall Tsuruta made it plain in her article for the Western Journal of Black Studies, where she explained:\n\n[The] culturally-derived concept, womanish (\u201cmannish\u201d for boys) is rooted in the social practice of Black adults, especially Black women, setting boundaries for Black girls.\n\nThough writer Alice Walker is sympathetic in redefining the expression to embolden young girls with womanish characteristics, many women remain stuck on its original connotations. They wax old toxic philosophies onto innocent girls\u2014much as Williams does, when she faults underage girls for their engagement with Kelly\u2014knowing full well that the law and power dynamics involved clearly define them as prey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t divorce that shaming of young black girls from the [parent] shaming we see online,\u201d Patton said, speaking of the extremes some women will go to to guilt their daughters.\n\nNothing good comes from this toxic policing of our girls. It upholds the patriarchal idea that black girls are fast-ass Jezebels who are sexually mature beyond their years and need to be subdued. It denies them the opportunity to be exactly who they are\u2014young girls. This castigation chips away their confidence, diminishes their self-esteem and stunts their agency. It robs them of the tools needed to protect themselves from being exploited\u2014sexually or otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams\u2019 dismissal of black women\u2019s agency is akin to silencing them. In a broader context, it contributes to the erasure of black women\u2014as if patriarchy, white feminism and the world at-large don\u2019t already have that task covered.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this before\u2014when the FBI, white liberals and activist groups tried to suppress the female voices of #BlackLivesMatter by co-opting their agenda. More recently, we saw it when ESPN suspended Jemele Hill for \u201ca second violation of social media guidelines\u201d\u2014also known as expressing her views as a black woman about a \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d president. The attempt to quiet black women is overwhelming, and where we don\u2019t need it is in spaces or conversations among our own.\n\nThe #MuteRKelly campaign is long overdue. For over 20 years, Kelly has reportedly engaged in felonious sex with underage women and allegedly continues to do so with impunity. This is mainly because the black community has not held Kelly or other sexual miscreants like him accountable. The fact that the #MuteRKelly campaign\u2019s creators, Kenyette Barnes and Oronike Odeleye, have come through to do the extreme lifting that no one else bothered to do speaks volumes to their commitment to black woman and girls. That Williams denigrates their efforts by stating, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work,\u201d further confirms that she does not value the voices of black women or their resistance.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOdeleye considers the slight a plus, telling The Glow Up:\n\nBy bringing up the #MuteRKelly discussion on the national stage, Wendy Williams helped spread the message that there are black women nationwide standing united to end the sexual, physical and mental abuse of our young black women. . .Wherever R. Kelly is performing, we\u2019ll be there. We won\u2019t rest until we have, at the very least, ended his career. We are working with the victims, victims\u2019 families and attorneys to bring yet another criminal case against him. We plan to be a needle in his side until he\u2019s in the poor house, a mental facility or a jail cell.\n\nTarana Burke, founder of the Me Too movement, also feels that Kelly\u2019s time is up and that he should not be \u201cconveniently\u201d left out of conversations on sexual assault, especially among black women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlack women are just as vocal about giving R. Kelly a chance. I\u2019ve seen Facebook statuses that say, \u2018I don\u2019t care who [R. Kelly] is fucking, I\u2019m going to see him tonight\u2014I\u2019m buying my ticket,\u2019\u201d Burke stated in a phone interview with The Glow Up.\n\nThe Me Too movement founded by Burke in 2006 is not be confused with the latest #MeToo movement tied to the sexual harassment and rape of women in Hollywood. Although the two intersect today, initially they did not. Burke\u2019s movement was specifically started for underserved black girls from low-income communities who were sexually victimized and in need of supportive healing.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Burke responded to Williams\u2019 inflammatory comments:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSexual violence knows no race, color, class or gender, but the response to sexual violence does,\u201d Burke said in our interview. \u201cThe response to sexual violence is highly gendered and highly racialized and definitely defined by class.\u201d\n\nYeah, that part.\n\nIt is this nuance that allows R. Kelly to get off scot-free. Williams is reckless and clearly driven by her black female antagonism in not making these distinctions. That Williams (and black women of the same ilk) can afford to be so \u201csick of\u201d #MeToo is really quite disconcerting. In the same vein as Kelly, she is both a trigger and the gun, busting shots at black women, exploiting them and denying their humanity. Like R. Kelly, Wendy is out here wildin\u2019, and she, too, needs to be put on mute.", "keywords": ["wildin", "black", "girls", "kelly", "assault", "muterkelly", "r", "williams", "wendy", "metoo", "young", "women", "comes", "twisted", "sexual"], "polarity": 0.01676189520560382, "subjectivity": 0.48182343778370257},

The local news was beginning to feel like trauma porn and was much too close to home.\n\nThe purge had been a healthy choice\u2014that is, until national news infiltrated my timeline, the Twitterverse and the whole-ass webosphere with film executive Harvey Weinstein\u2019s alleged history of rape and sexual assault against women he worked with. Not long after, Kevin Spacey, lead actor of Bryan Singer\u2019s The Usual Suspects, entered a band of unusual suspects\u2014grown-ass men accused of sexually preying on children. Spacey apologized to his accuser, actor Anthony Rapp, who was 14 years old at the time he says he was assaulted, for \u201cwhat would have been deeply inappropriate behavior\u201d\u2014behavior that Spacey doesn\u2019t quite recall.\n\nWhile all of this news is disturbing, none of it hits close to home like the more obscure, resurfacing news of R&B musician R. Kelly and his alleged bizarre sexual practices and undying affinity for underage black girls. Apparently, the victimization of young black girls is not newsworthy enough for the mass media or the court of public opinion to be engrossed or enraged at Weinstein levels. Both treat the sexual assault of black girls as if it were hardly news at all. To a fault, they are right. The predatory sexualization of young black girls is so ubiquitous, it is damn near an accepted social and cultural norm.\n\n\n\nThe system of slavery helped us arrive at this place, where black girls are denied humanity. In captivity, their bodies were perpetually preyed upon. In bondage, they were much more than field hands and domestics. Not only did they have the duty of being medical lab rats, as was the case of Anarcha, Betsey and Lucy\u2014three slave girls used for gynecological experimentation by physician J. Marion Sims\u2014but they were also forced to sexually perform as bed wenches and breeders.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the most profound case, an enslaved Sally Hemings bore six children by her master, Thomas Jefferson, the first at age 15\u2014when he was 43. Because Jefferson kept her close, in a bedroom adjacent to his own, many historians make the mistake of romanticizing Hemings and Jefferson\u2019s relationship as some enchanting antebellum love affair, but we must be clear of its obvious implications. The dynamic between slaveholder and slave is one of absolute power. A sexual relationship between a fully grown man and an adolescent child is absolutely salacious. It is statutory rape\u2014albeit sanctioned by the laws of the land at the time.\n\n\n\nAnd although white supremacist, capitalist patriarchy serves as a springboard for society\u2019s well-established disregard of young black girls, the slave code ended 152 years ago. We all should know better and do better\u2014especially the black community.\n\nGrowing up between the late 1980s and early \u201990s, during the peak of the crack era, it was not uncommon to see fresh, baby-faced girls in the company of men who were well into their mid-20s or older. The practice of courting minors was not exclusive to any particular demographic of men. It included the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody\u2014and for the most part, they all had short eyes. These sexual predators, in the heart of many hoods, exacted power over teenage girls through fast cars, money and drugs.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Connecticut Alliance to End Sexual Violence, approximately 40 percent of black women report coercive sexual contact by age 18.\n\n\n\nI am no stranger to this lifestyle.\n\nI know firsthand about having one\u2019s virginity pounded into extinction, at the age of 14, for a pair of Reebok 54-11\u2019s and a pair of gold bangle earrings\u2014compliments of a 23-year-old fan. I was finessed. It was like taking candy from a baby, and it was also euphemized rape. Not one rational adult intervened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSexual predation, for many black girls, starts long before the age of sexual awareness. They become innocent victims in their own households, social settings, churches and schools under the guise of supervision. These girls are preyed upon by family members, community leaders, religious figures and educators. In a lot of cases, they are disappointed in and dismissed by adults they should be able to trust.\n\n\n\nSome are victim-shamed; others are disbelieved or silenced by threats, like those the now-13-year-old alleged victim of Jelani Maraj, the brother of rapper Nicki Minaj, describes; those experienced by 18-year-old Anna Chambers, who tells of having been sexually assaulted by two New York City police officers while detained; and those made against the unprecedented number of girls whose names we do not know\u2014yes, #ThemToo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSexual violence is projected onto black girls at a higher rate than it is onto other races and ethnicities. In the Fourth National Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect:\n\nAfrican-American women were 1.75 times more likely than white women to have experienced child sexual abuse.\n\n\n\nAfrican-American women were more likely to report the occurrence of child sexual abuse during adolescence.\n\n\n\nAfrican-American women were more likely to report an increased incidence of perpetrators living in the same household.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese facts are hella disturbing and reflect a culture of sexual violence against black girls that remains crickets as fuck. Where\u2019s the community outrage? Where is the overwhelming media coverage? For black girls, there is no black collective rallying against these crimes. There is no public shaming or takedown of sexual violators, because society gives zero fucks, and the black community protects its villains and devalues its girls.\n\nTarana Burke, founder of the #MeToo movement\u2014an initiative that supports young women surviving sexual assault\u2014agrees that in the black community, the value of girls is at an all-time low. \u201cWe all have to be accountable for how we view and protect and cast our black girls,\u201d Burke says.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a phone interview, she expressed that \u201cthe world diminishes black girls and the black community upholds it.\u201d This flagrant attitude toward young black women is the very thing that keeps R. Kelly in business and away from major media attention.\n\nBurke makes it clear that Weinstein and Kelly are of the same ilk. She notes that while the former receives a national flogging for sexually assaulting grown white women, the latter continues to get away unscathed for alleged sex crimes against underage black girls. Black people\u2019s allegiance to Kelly is reflective of how the black community celebrates its villains, and hints at the lack of value placed on young girls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlack people have to shift their way of thinking when it comes to black girls. We have to believe our young girls and recognize when they\u2019ve been violated. Support them.\u201d \u2014Tarana Burke\n\nAs simple as it seems, Burke\u2019s statement is a whole-ass word.\n\n\n\nBut what statement is Snoop Dogg making when he features R. Kelly at his wife\u2019s birthday event? What do his actions convey to young black girls?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe\u2019s a clown\u2014shitting on black-girl value.\n\nInstead of inviting predators to the barbecue, Sunday dinner and birthday bashes; instead of calling out a high-profile Hollywood rapist, perhaps we should be as vigilant in calling out our own. As Burke puts it, \u201cKelly belongs to us. He is ours to deal with.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe must begin to fully reckon with that dealing. That also goes for those uncles who we know have their own Weinstein-length histories of fondling pubescent nieces; brothers who overpower young sisters, as actor Kevin Spacey allegedly did his victim; friendly neighbors who stalk our girls\u2019 bodies; Ahk and them from the corner bodega, who bribe young daughters into storeroom closets; hustlers who pick and pluck them; pimps who turn them out. Like Robert Kelly, they ain\u2019t shit.\n\nWhen we seek accountability from others, perhaps we hold ourselves accountable as well, for aiding and abetting, for being quiet, for turning blind eyes to those in close proximity. \u2019Cause at the end of the day, if we\u2019re going to normalize pedophilia and sexual misconduct in our own spaces, perpetuated on our own girls, then we must acknowledge our own complicity\u2014admit that we, too, ain\u2019t shit.\n\nJustification for that type of foul ain\u2019t justice at all. If we stop letting heathens off the hook for sexualizing our babies, then perhaps we can stop blaming our babies for being sexualized.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIda Harris is aiight with standard English but poetic with black vernacular.

I believe that cats were put on earth to kill things. And I believe the universe recycles.\n\n\n\nReincarnation is real.

That girl is, like, 16.\u201d He tried to laugh it off by joking: \u201cYou know what Keith Sweat said: She may be young, but ... \u201d\n\nBy then the rest of the people at the table agreed that he was being a little bit rapey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few months later, I was with the same friends at the same watering hole (what, motherfucker? It\u2019s not like I live in Paris. I\u2019m in Birmingham!), and they began telling me about a high school teacher who had been arrested on charges that he slept with multiple students.

I\u2019m not insinuating that every guy who makes suggestive comments to a Buffalo Wild Wings waitress is a potential sexual assaulter. But I wonder how often we perpetuate the ideology of the disposability of women\u2019s bodies by just not saying shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we are honest, every single man has known a guy who was a habitual line stepper when it came to women or who was a little bit rapey.

The football teammate who always talks about \u201crunning a train.\u201d I also believe every single white person has a parent, co-worker or cousin (wait ... do white people have cousins?) who leans a \u201clittle bit racist.\u201d\n\nBut just like there is no such thing as being a little bit racist, there is no such thing as being \u201ca little bit rapey.\u201d\n\nWhy are we cool with one and not the other?\n\nIf we refused to remain quiet about the dudes who do this shit, I\u2019m not saying that it would end sexual assault, but it might curtail the actions of the men whose actions are fueled by the complicity of silence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEveryone knew about Harvey Weinstein and didn\u2019t say shit.

Kelly\u2019s alleged predatory behavior, providing the umpteenth reminder that the singer continues to hide in plain sight. In \u201cSurviving R. Kelly,\u201d former DJ Kitti Jones recounts her past relationship with Kelly and accuses him of physically abusing her, forcing her to have sex with other women, and urinating on her. During a particularly scary fight, she says, \u201cMy heart was just beating through my chest...He just turned into a monster.\u201d\n\nIt is an agonizing account of an abusive relationship, and it\u2019s not the only one out there. In a fairer world, R. Kelly should be rotting in a prison cell in a state of perpetual irritation that he\u2019ll never get to perform \u201cBump \u2018N Grind\u201d outside any venue not under the control of the Illinois Department of Corrections. No amount of \u201cgenius\u201d\u2014which has been long cited by fans who continue to monetarily support him in spite of a now decades-old accusations of inappropriate sexual relationships with minors\u2014can excuse anyone\u2019s predatory behavior.\n\nR. Kelly, his chocolate factory, his Zorro-inspired masks, his chitlin-play esque \u201cTrapped In The Closet\u201d series, his fake-ass Sam Cooke impersonations, and most of all, his incessant and at times antagonistic displays of overt sexuality in his music and accompanying imagery should have never happened, and the man behind it all should be rendered a pariah expelled from the pop cultural zeitgeist.\n\n\n\nInstead, in 2017, R. Kelly continues to thrive as an artist. What makes this all the more infuriating is that the Rolling Stone report comes at a moment in history in which powerful, predatory men are facing repercussions for their behavior.\n\n\n\nWhat will it take to get more of us to give a damn about R. Kelly\u2019s alleged crimes? The answer may lie in who his victims are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarvey Weinstein may reportedly remain dedicated to making films in the future despite being marred in scandal and now presently under investigation for rape, but for all intents and purposes, he is done in Hollywood. Bill Cosby may or may not face prison time over allegations of rape, but his legacy is forever tarnished and he, a self-important moralizer to poor black people, has been exposed as a hypocrite. Moreover, if Page Six is correct that the comedian is taking $30 million loan against his Upper East Side townhouse to pay for his mounting legal bills as he prepares for retrial for sexual assault, his fortune is shrinking. Cosby\u2019s millions were built on a lie and used to obstruct justice and continue to violate women\u2019s autonomy: Let him die broke.\n\n\n\nWe also now know just how much sexual harassment permeated the workplace at Fox News. Reports of said harassment led to the ouster of the late Roger Ailes, who served as chairman and CEO of Fox News, and later, its biggest star, Bill O\u2019Reilly. In the case of O\u2019Reilly, who is actively seeking a return to television, we are still learning details about how willing Fox News was to look the other way at allegations of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s sexual harassment for the sake of ratings.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, CNN reported that political analyst, author, and regular regurgitation of bullshit Mark Halperin sexually harassed and assaulted numerous women during his time as ABC News political director. Already, MSNBC has released a statement: \u201cWe find the story and the allegations very troubling. Mark Halperin is leaving his role as a contributor until the questions around his past conduct are fully understood.\u201d Time will likely not be kind to Halperin, who infamously referred to then-President Obama as a \u201cdick.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGood riddance.\n\nAnd yet, nothing has happened to R. Kelly despite similar reporting. This summer, Buzzfeed published a story that alleged Kelly has maintained a \u201csex cult.\u201d The gruesome details therein\u2014that he forces women to call him \u201cdaddy\u201d and controls every aspect of their lives, down to when they can urinate\u2014made the story go viral, but the tour went on and those who have continued to collaborate with him offered no comments on it. Shortly thereafter, Jezebel published an interview with another alleged former girlfriend who repeated some of the same accusations found in the Buzzfeed expose. The reporter behind the piece, Jim DeRogatis, has tried to warn the public about Kelly since his days as the pop music critic at the Chicago Sun-Times.\n\n\n\nR. Kelly has been particularly smug and open about his predatory antics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of that Kelly from touring\u2014with the likes of successful female artists such as Monica and LeToya Luckett on the tour bill. One skim of Ticketmaster reveals that Kelly has arena tour dates through the end of the year. Kelly also remains a fixture on the radio. And based on Sam Smith wearing a T-shirt with his face plastered on it, Kelly remains a figure whose reverence is expanding with future generations rather than rightfully dying. Worse, many of his fans continue to be willfully ignorant about the accusations leveled against him. Because if you are buying a ticket to see R. Kelly perform, you are choosing to align yourself with a predator and dancing along to him in total complicity.\n\n\n\nWhat will it take to get more of us to give a damn about R. Kelly\u2019s alleged crimes? The answer may lie in who his victims are.\n\nThe difference between Kelly and other powerful men like Weinstein and Ailes is that Kelly\u2019s accusers are primarily black girls and women. Black girls and women who are young or underage. Black girls and women who are poor or working class, particularly the ones involved in the cases DeRogatis investigated decades ago. Black girls and women who are not famous. It is also not easy for black girls and women of means and notoriety to earn the respect they deserve, so the burden on those without either to get people to care is even higher.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Weinstein, no matter how powerful, could not match the celebrity of his accusers, which ranged from Mira Sorvino to Ashley Judd. Many of the women accusing Cosby of assault were white women; the most high-profile non-white accuser, legendary black model Beverly Johnson, was already famous. One can\u2019t be certain that it was all white women accusing Halperin and O\u2019Reilly of sexual misconduct and harassment respectively, but it is a reasonable assumption that most of them were, given the lack of diversity at mainstream media outlets. The same can be said of Megyn Kelly, a blond, white Fox News anchor and household name who spoke out against Ailes, effectively sealing his fate.\n\nOf course, R. Kelly isn\u2019t the only alleged predator thriving despite widespread rumors of abuse. Woody Allen continues to work with Hollywood\u2019s young actresses and veteran Oscar winners despite allegations that he molested Mia Farrow\u2019s adopted daughter, Dylan. Then there is the 45th president of the United States, the self-congratulating pussy grabber.\n\nBut R. Kelly has been particularly smug and open about his predatory antics. His accusations have followed him for 20 years and he\u2019s left not only a widely reported paper trail in legal settlements, but in interviews when asked about whether he liked teenager girls, answered, first asked for clarification on how young in age constituted a teen. He was openly married to a teenage Aaliyah in the 1990s. When Kelly was acquitted on 14 counts of child pornography, five jurors claimed the absence of testimony from the alleged victim served as \u201cbig handicap\u201d in the prosecutor\u2019s case\u2014a case that took prosecutors six years to get to trial.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all know who R. Kelly really is. The question is whether he will he ever face any consequences. It may take a critical mass of victims to speak out, like in the cases of Cosby and Weinstein. But if the past is prologue, there is reason to worry. And even if Kelly finally faces the public banishment his accused behavior has commanded, it needn\u2019t ever be lost on us why it took so long to happen.", "keywords": ["predatory", "black", "girls", "kelly", "meet", "weinstein", "r", "alleged", "harvey", "fate", "particularly", "women", "sexual"], "polarity": 0.052174408014571946, "subjectivity": 0.4308380371904962},

Kelly\u2019s ex-girlfriends has come forward in a Rolling Stone article with new allegations of sexual, emotional and physical abuse against the R&B singer.\n\nKitti Jones, a former radio DJ, cataloged the entire dizzying, two-year relationship with the \u201cPied Piper\u201d of R&B to the magazine, describing how they met (at an after-party following his Dallas concert), his \u201ccourteous courtship\u201d of her, and the escalating incidents of abusive behavior that came to characterize their relationship.\n\nThe story follows a blockbuster BuzzFeed report from Jim DeRogatis, who has followed sexual abuse allegations against Robert Kelly for decades. That story details multiple claims that Kelly held women against their will in a \u201ccult.\u201d Jones was among DeRogatis\u2019 sources.\n\nBelow are some of the most troubling, brutal allegations from Jones, according to the report:\n\nOn meeting R. Kelly at a hotel for the first time:\n\n\u201cI got there before he did because he of course doesn\u2019t like to fly, so he\u2019s taking the bus,\u201d Jones says. She had sent Kelly \u201cracy photos\u201d while he was en route to the hotel and was excited to reunite face-to-face. As she waited in the hotel room for Kelly to arrive, she heard a knock at the door. \u201cHe brushed past me,\u201d Jones says. \u201cI\u2019m thinking we\u2019re going to hug or peck each other. But he plopped down on the couch and pulled out his penis and started pleasuring himself.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones told Rolling Stone she was stunned by Kelly\u2019s audacity and said that if he had been \u201ca regular guy working at CVS\u201d she would have been furious, but she was entranced by months of communication and flirting. Still, looking back, she said, there were warning signs:\n\n\u201cI was attracted to him and was just like, \u2018Well, OK. Fine,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe he just has weird ways of getting off.\u201d The two had oral sex that weekend, with Kelly, according to Jones, saying things like, \u201cI gotta teach you how to be with me\u201d and \u201cI gotta train you.\u201d \u201cHe was like a drill sergeant even when he was pleasuring me,\u201d Jones says. \u201cHe was telling me how to bend my back or move my leg here. I\u2019m like, \u2018Why is he directing it like this?\u2019 It was very uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nOn how R. Kelly\u2019s behavior changed once she moved out to Chicago to be with him:\n\nAlmost instantly upon moving to Chicago, Jones says, Kelly began governing nearly every detail of her life, starting with the requirement that she wear baggy sweatpants whenever she went out and text near-constant updates on her whereabouts. (A source who knew Kelly confirmed the singer\u2019s demands on Jones to Rolling Stone.) Jones says she was forced to text either the singer or one of his employees for even the slightest request. (Sample text message: \u201cDaddy, I need to go to the restroom.\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the day Jones confronted him about the infamous tape that shows the singer allegedly urinating on a teenage girl:\n\nJones had been living with Kelly for less than a month when she claims the first instance of physical abuse occurred, in November 2011. Jones says that on a return trip to Dallas around Thanksgiving, she saw for the first time the video at the heart of his child-pornography trial and challenged Kelly on the phone about it. \u201cHe said, \u2018Bitch, don\u2019t you ever fucking accuse me of something like that,\u2019\u201d Jones says. \u201cHe never had spoken to me like that before.\u201d\n\n\n\nJones claims Kelly remained enraged when she flew back and met him at the airport. \u201cMy heart was just beating through my chest,\u201d she says. \u201cHe just turned into a monster. I blamed myself \u2018cause I was like, \u2018Maybe I shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve said anything.\u2019\u201d As they drove home, Jones says she repeatedly apologized while Kelly kicked her multiple times and delivered a series of open-handed slaps to her face. \u201cI was putting my hand over my face and telling him I was sorry,\u201d Jones says. \u201cHe would start kicking me, telling me I was a stupid bitch [and] don\u2019t ever get in his business.\u201d The next day, Jones says, the couple went shopping and neither spoke about the incident.\n\nOn how Kelly\u2019s manipulation escalated when Jones was moved into a home with two of Kelly\u2019s other girlfriends:\n\nThere were no locks on the doors, but cameras monitored every move and Kelly would punish the women for attempting to leave for any reason without permission. (The source who knew Kelly independently confirmed Kelly\u2019s rules with his girlfriends to Rolling Stone.) Kelly would frequently take away Jones\u2019 phone as punishment\u2014sometimes as long as two months\u2014cutting off her ability to request food or perform basic functions, according to Jones and the other source who knew him.\n\nTwo months into living at the studio, Jones says, Kelly began using starvation on her as punishment for not following his orders. Jones says the longest she went without food was two and a half days, though single days without a meal were not uncommon.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn how the singer forced Jones to have sex with other female partners:\n\nKelly would frequently fly girls in for sex, says Jones, and order her and his other girlfriends to hook up with them. \u201cYou can\u2019t say no because you\u2019re going to get punished,\u201d she says. \u201cYou just become numb to what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s so traumatic the things that he makes you do to other people and to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe videotapes everything that he does, and sometimes he\u2019ll just make you watch what he\u2019s done to other girls or girls that he had be together,\u201d she adds. \u201cHe would masturbate to that and then have you give him oral sex while he\u2019s watching what he did with somebody else on his iPad.\u201d\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is arguably most disturbing about Jones\u2019 described relationship with Kelly is her self-admitted protectiveness of the singer, even after she said he routinely isolated her, demeaned her, starved her and forced her into nonconsensual sex acts. After Jones severed her romantic relationship with Kelly in 2013, she told Rolling Stone that she reached out to the singer after a tense video interview with the Huffington Post.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, my God, poor thing,\u2019\u201d Jones told the magazine.\n\nNow, Jones says, she is coming forward with her story because she wants other women to speak up about abuse they\u2019ve suffered at Kelly\u2019s hands, and to encourage the public to take the decades of allegations seriously.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI want them to not be so dismissive towards the women that are speaking out,\u201d says Jones, who, Rolling Stone reports, is currently exploring her legal options against the singer.\n\nDespite the swirl of allegations that have followed Kelly throughout the career, there is currently no open criminal investigation against him.\n\n\n\nRead more at Rolling Stone.", "keywords": ["recentand", "disturbingabuse", "stone", "sex", "kelly", "singer", "r", "kellys", "rolling", "allegations", "women", "launched", "report", "jones", "abuse"], "polarity": -0.020709918736234536, "subjectivity": 0.42943452746084326},

I\u2019ve also permanently banned all R. Kelly music from my life. I also believe that some police are racist and allow that racism to decide how they are going to handle a situation involving African Americans before they\u2019ve even encountered them.\n\nAs such, I believe that kneeling during the national anthem is not only the righteous thing for NFL players to do but is also the morally just thing to do. I understand that many African Americans don\u2019t share my view; in fact, the one thing we can all agree on is that when it comes to protesting, we don\u2019t all agree. So I\u2019ve compiled a list of 10 things that I know all black people will protest.\n\n\n\n1. No Altering the Menu at Starbucks\n\nWe love to customize shit. Even noncustomizable shit\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter. Cars, teeth, nails, hair, skin\u2014we will customize the fuck out of it. And nothing is more customizable than a Starbucks drink order.\n\nNot being allowed to walk into a Starbucks and order a \u201ctallande* double-whip, no-foam mochaccino with unicorn sprinkles and elf tears, stirred with the ivory tusk of a baby elephant\u201d will turn black America upside down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n*A tallande is where you cut a tall cup in half and staple it to the top of grande cup. And yes, it\u2019s still smaller than a venti.\n\n2. No Child Tax Credit\n\nTax season is arguably the flossiest season of all time. We Birdman hand-rub in anticipation of tax season, and that nice little Child Tax Credit bump is already planned into everyone\u2019s budget. Does it offset the cost of having a child? Hell no, but once it hits, you know you can finally make that dermatologist appointment and get the extra skin-care products that they keep in the locked glass case at CVS. Buying fancy skin care and making a dermatology appointment is balling to people of a certain age.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Popeyes Decides to Never Bring Back the $5 Big Box\n\nBlack people love to back away from chicken. In fact, just seeing this as a protest topic has made some black folks cringe. It\u2019s a cultural embarrassment, and in truth, we shouldn\u2019t love chicken so much, but we do. And this feels like a safe space to admit it. You know what else we love as much as chicken? Discounts. So when Popeyes has the $5 Big Box, we send out group texts letting each other know. Let Popeyes try and shut this down and watch how quickly we mobilize.\n\n4. A Nationwide Shortage of Talenti Gelato\n\nBlack people love fancy ice cream, and it doesn\u2019t get much fancier than this. I have often said that if you want me to be there, then you have to have Talenti gelato. I have left parties early because they didn\u2019t have it. On the promise of Talenti gelato, I will protest while holding a tiki torch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. The Lottery Stops the Three- and Four-Digit Number\n\nI don\u2019t know anyone who has ever hit the number. Wait, I take that back\u2014my dad once hit the number, and it wasn\u2019t so much that he hit the number as it was the story of how the number came to him. Black people dream numbers. Family members who have passed to the other side send numbers back in dreams. My dad believes to this day that he didn\u2019t hit the number so much as it was destined for him to hit the number. He dreamed it and played it and won a pretty good amount of money. \u201cThe numbers\u201d are a staple in the black community, and taking it away would literally be like taking the black community\u2019s dreams. It\u2019s low-level investing, and stopping it would cause a nationwide black panic.\n\n6. The Disappearance of the Shirtless Snake Guy\n\nSince I was a boy, the shirtless snake guy has been a part of my collective memory. He was at every health care expo, Taste of the City, 8th Street Festival, Beach Week. If there was a monument to universal blackness, it would be a shirtless muscular black man with a snake around his neck or arm. He\u2019s a fixture at all black outdoor universal summer events, and his disappearance would cause mass hysteria in the black community because for once, we\u2019d all finally agree that without him, there is a glitch in the matrix.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. No More Macy\u2019s Coupons\n\nLook, I don\u2019t want to stereotype, but here comes some crazy-big stereotyping: Black women love Macy\u2019s. Older black women would marry Macy\u2019s if they could. My mom does all her Christmas shopping at Macy\u2019s, and on the off chance that she couldn\u2019t find something for one of us at Macy\u2019s, then you know what we\u2019re getting for Christmas? That\u2019s right, you guessed it: a Macy\u2019s gift card.\n\nAs such, black women live for the coupons that come in the mail and the ones online. If Macy\u2019s stopped with the coupons, black women would shut it down. And black men would follow suit, if for no other reason than to get their women out of the house on Sunday so they can secretly watch the football they are supposed to be boycotting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Frank\u2019s Hot Sauce Becomes the Official Hot Sauce of America\n\nThe Root\u2019s official hot-sauce aficionado, Lawrence Ware, once exclaimed that Frank\u2019s RedHot is the \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d of hot sauce. Truthfully, Frank\u2019s hot sauce is trash. It\u2019s basically spicy water, and declaring this the official hot sauce of America would not only infuriate scores of American-born black folks\u2014it would increase the black market on Caribbean-made pepper sauce, which is basically the moonshine of hot sauces.\n\n9. A Nationwide Ban on Slamming Dominoes and Pasting Big Jokers on Your Forehead\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to play dominoes without slamming them, and I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to play spades without someone at some point pasting a big Joker on his or her forehead because the nature of both games, mixed with showboat ancestry, requires that both be done. I don\u2019t want to imagine a world where quiet dominoes are played and a big Joker isn\u2019t treated with the respect it deserves. I know that I\u2019m not alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. A Shortage of Three-Cheese Blend, Mexican-Cheese Blend, Block Cheese and Any Other Cheese and/or Cheese Blends During Thanksgiving\n\nTwo things I must know about you before I can eat your mac and cheese: I will need to see this year\u2019s tax returns, and I will need to know if you think the word \u201cexcessive\u201d exists when making mac and cheese. The first tells me where you are financially and whether you can afford the amount of cheese needed to make a decent mac and cheese, and the second tells me if you are willing to go there.\n\nThere is no such thing as making a \u201ctoo cheesy\u201d mac and cheese. Research shows that the words \u201cThis mac and cheese is OK, but it\u2019s too cheesy\u201d have never been said in the black linguistic lexicon dating back as far as 1842. It\u2019s never happened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn order to make a good mac and cheese for, say, four people, you need at least 35 bags of three-cheese blend and 14 bags of Mexican-cheese blend. Anything less than that and there is a good chance that I will throw your mac and cheese out and talk about you on my Popeyes group chat.", "keywords": ["cheese", "things", "black", "sauce", "mac", "know", "number", "love", "hot", "dont", "macys", "protest"], "polarity": 0.04214015151515154, "subjectivity": 0.46911139455782325},

Kelly continues to deny any wrongdoing when it comes to holding women captive and sexually assaulting teenagers, but one woman is now speaking out about the abuse she says she experienced at the hands of \u201cthe Pied Piper of R&B.\u201d\n\nLast month, in an interview published by BuzzFeed, 24-year-old Jerhonda Pace came forward and violated a nondisclosure agreement with claims of underage sex with the R&B singer.\n\nPace, who met Kelly when she was just 15 years old, said the singer was like Charles Manson.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have anybody to speak up on my behalf when I was going through what I was going through with him. He\u2019s brainwashed them really bad, and it kind of reminds me of Charles Manson,\u201d Pace said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd on Monday in an interview with The Real, Pace delved deeper into what she says occurred with Kelly, including an allegation that an older woman was around to teach Pace and other young girls how to please Kelly.\n\n\u201cThe trainer, it\u2019s a woman\u2014she trains you to please him sexually,\u201d Pace said. \u201cShe told me how to please him, and she also taught me what I liked.\u201d\n\nIn describing the encounter, Pace also said that Kelly took her virginity.\n\n\u201cI got invited to his tour bus.

Kelly\u2014specifically, the support of him, the defense of him and the wagons circling around him\u2014from most other notable moral quandaries is the lack of any sort of reasonable justification for any continued Kelly-centric advocacy or patronage. For instance, it\u2019s no secret now that Chick-fil-A has donated considerable resources to fight against marriage equality. But when you actually walk past a Chick-fil-A in a mall food court, and you\u2019re greeted by the preternaturally peppy and kind cashiers and managers (some of whom might be gay or trans themselves), perhaps you can talk yourself into a Smokehouse BBQ Bacon Sandwich. This doesn\u2019t make that decision right. But a reasonable justification does exist.\n\nThere are no such excuses with R. Kelly\u2014no opportunities to forget that he is exactly who he is. His alleged criminality and sexual deviance have been corroborated by numerous people\u2014including men and women who\u2019ve lived in Chicago and have either witnessed Kelly stalking and preying on high-school-age girls or have actually been one of the young girls who caught his eye. Jim DeRogatis has made it his personal mission to descend as far down the R. Kelly rabbit hole as he can go, unlocking new terrors with each stage:\n\nOver the next seven months, Pace says she had sex with Kelly repeatedly, a claim she would later repeat during her settlement process. Without asking her permission, Kelly filmed most of the encounters on his iPhone or a video camera on a tripod, Pace says and a settlement draft reiterates. \u201cI had to call him \u2018daddy,\u2019 and he would call me \u2018baby.\u2019 He wanted me to have two pigtails, and I had to go out and find little schoolgirl outfits.\u201d If Kelly was previously unaware of Pace\u2019s age, she says she told him for certain that she was 16 on July 17, 2009, a claim she also made in the aforementioned documents. \u201cI gave him my state ID,\u201d she says. She recalls that Kelly told her things were fine, but that she should tell anyone who asked that she was 19, and act like she was 25. Pace says that she started spending weekends with Kelly at his Olympia Fields home. While she was in the mansion, she says, she had to follow Kelly\u2019s \u201crules,\u201d which included dressing in baggy clothes, turning over her phone, and asking permission to shower, eat, go to the bathroom, and leave the property. If she broke the rules, she says, she was mentally and physically abused. \u201cAt the time, I didn\u2019t know what I liked, honestly,\u201d Pace says, explaining why she complied. \u201cI just knew that I liked his music, so I was pretty much accepting of anything that came with him at the time.\u201d\n\nAlthough the name \u201cJerhonda Pace\u201d might be new, nothing she\u2019s saying about R. Kelly is particularly novel. And I\u2019m sure most of those who\u2019ve defended him and defended their continued fandom before will continue to. Because \u201cthose girls were fast.\u201d And also because of the distinction between R. Kelly the man and R. Kelly the artist.\n\nSeveral people, including DeRogatis, have written and commented on the abject wrongness of believing those girls \u201cknew what they were doing,\u201d and what the continued cultural embrace and patronage of R. Kelly says about our feelings about black women and girls, and whether we collectively believe they deserve protection and care. (We don\u2019t.)\n\nBut some of those who believe in the separation between the art and the man are still able to possess a convenient level of cognitive dissonance, allowing them to distill the musical parts of him away from his madness. But that doesn\u2019t exist, either. The separation between the two is mythical: a fabrication invented by those who wish to pretend that R. Kelly\u2019s musical catalog isn\u2019t also filled with both reminders and taunts of his alleged sex crimes. The title of the hit he wrote for Aaliyah\u2014his eventual teenage wife\u2014was \u201cAge Ain\u2019t Nothing but a Number.\u201d His studio is named the Chocolate Factory.

Kelly. Johnson didn\u2019t meet him at a concert, or at her high school, where Kelly was allegedly known to troll. Johnson met Kelly while on daily watch outside his child-pornography trial in 2008.\n\nIn a new report for BuzzFeed News, Jim DeRogatis interviewed Pace about claims that she received \u201ccash settlements from the star in return for signing nondisclosure agreements.\u201d\n\n\n\nNow known as Jerhonda Pace, the 24-year-old is a mother of three children and is speaking out and violating her nondisclosure agreement in order to help other women and girls who might be in the same situation she says she was in as a teen.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have anybody to speak up on my behalf when I was going through what I was going through with him. He\u2019s brainwashed them really bad, and it kind of reminds me of Charles Manson,\u201d Pace said of the singer.\n\nIn 2008, Pace said, she lied to court officials about her age in order to gain access to the trial, because at the time, she was under 18. Pace said she would cut class just to get a glimpse of Kelly. A year later, Pace, who was then 16, alleges that she received a message on Facebook from an associate of Kelly\u2019s and she was invited to his Chicago mansion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the age of 16, Pace alleges, she engaged in oral sex with Kelly, and claims the singer ensured that she wouldn\u2019t speak about their sexual activity by having her write and sign letters stating that she stole from him and that her parents were blackmailing him, which she now says were lies.\n\nPace told BuzzFeed that Kelly was strict with rules in his home. She says she was only allowed to wear baggy clothes and couldn\u2019t use a phone. She also had to ask when to shower, eat and use the bathroom. If the rules were broken, Pace alleges, Kelly would physically and mentally abuse her.\n\nOn June 9, 2009, Pace alleges, Kelly gave her alcohol, and the two of them had intercourse. A month later, she says she told Kelly her true age, which she says he was fine with. The sex continued for months, says Pace, who alleges that Kelly filmed the encounters without her permission.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2010, Pace\u2019s \u201crelationship\u201d with Kelly ended after she says he caught her texting a friend and attacked her, BuzzFeed reports. Pace then contacted Susan E. Loggans, an attorney who was known for getting cash settlements for other women who had accused Kelly of similar acts of sexual abuse and battery.\n\nPace passed the lie detector tests given to her by Loggans, who eventually secured a large settlement within weeks of her taking on the case, BuzzFeed reports. In return for the settlement, Pace signed a nondisclosure agreement, which stated that she would not discuss the case or pursue any further accusations against Kelly. But all of that changed after Pace learned of other women who allegedly are still being abused by Kelly in his \u201ccult,\u201d according to the report.\n\nKelly yet again denies these accusations, just as he did previous ones from earlier this summer, which were also brought to light by writer DeRogatis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe allegations against Mr. Kelly are false, and are being made by individuals known to be dishonest. It is clear these continuing stories are the result of the effort of those with personal agendas who are working in concert to interfere with and damage his career. Mr. Kelly again denies any and all wrongdoing and is taking appropriate legal action to protect himself from ongoing defamation,\u201d Trevian Kutti, a Kelly spokesperson, said in a press release.\n\n\n\nPace says she is now considering filing criminal charges against Kelly.", "keywords": ["claims", "age", "known", "pace", "kelly", "agreement", "johnson", "r", "accuser", "nondisclosure", "violates", "alleges", "underagesex", "buzzfeed", "women", "trial"], "polarity": 0.03646445659603553, "subjectivity": 0.3890168603326498},

G. Taylor Spink Award, given to her for meritorious contributions to baseball writing. She is the 68th recipient of the award from the Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America, and the first female honoree \u2014 a formal acknowledgment that men do not own exclusive rights to the most powerful written words.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018I humbly stand on stage for those who were stung by racism or sexism or any other insidious bias and persevered,\u2019 Smith said. \u2018You are unbreakable. You make me proud.\u2019\n\n\u201cSmith, 64, spent more than three decades as a newspaper reporter and columnist, including a significant stint as a national baseball writer and columnist for The New York Times from 1991 to 1998. During that period, she wrote about the near death and rebirth of the sport \u2014 from the destructive strike that wiped out the 1994 season to the dawning of a new Yankees dynasty at the end of the decade. She later moved home to work for the Philadelphia Inquirer and became a news editor for ESPN in 2007.\n\n\u201cIt was before that, during her years with The Hartford Courant as a pioneering, full-time female baseball beat writer covering the Yankees, that Smith met the most resistance from players and officials. But not from that era\u2019s tumultuous Yanks, she said with a laugh. \u2018They hardly noticed me, she said, \u2018because they were holding on for dear life.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cInstead, her greatest challenge came from the San Diego Padres during their 1984 playoff series against the Chicago Cubs.

Lack set out to abandon most of the channel\u2019s low-rated opinion-based programming and install in its place news-heavy programs that would make MSNBC more like the channel\u2019s sister site, NBC News. (Stephens, like some of the other recent hires, contributes to both.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the election of Donald Trump has complicated that evolution, raising the profile and popularity of MSNBC\u2019s liberal hosts just as Lack sought to dial back the network\u2019s liberal identity. . . .\u201d\n\nSutton also wrote, \u201cWhat has stung the most to some people hasn\u2019t simply been the hires of ex-Fox talent or outspoken conservatives, but the fact that the hires have seemed to replace many of the network\u2019s hosts of color. Since Lack\u2019s return to MSNBC, according to HuffPost, at least nine contributors and show hosts of color have departed the channel. The loss of several familiar faces of color has been particularly stark against the backdrop of the new hires, many of whom are white.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cConcerns about diversity have been amplified in part by a series of contentious departures that have played out in the press. In February 2016, progressive weekend host Melissa Harris-Perry, who is black, refused to appear on her show, publicly alleging that the network was trying to usurp her 4-year-old program and dictate her editorial choices. She was fired, prompting discussion over whether MSNBC remained committed to the diverse opinions and guests that Harris-Perry\u2019s show had prioritized.\n\n\u201cThe conversation arose again when anchor Jose Diaz-Balart was regularly preempted for election coverage. (Diaz-Balart, who is Cuban-American, is no longer an MSNBC host, but he remains a host on NBCUniversal\u2019s Telemundo and on NBC News.) And it reached a fever pitch in January following the abrupt departure of NBC News and MSNBC host Tamron Hall, who reportedly decided to leave the network after discovering she would lose her Today show hour to [Megyn] Kelly.\n\n\u201cNo one Mic spoke to believed Lack intentionally targeted hosts of color, but four MSNBC insiders said they do not believe Lack actively prioritizes on-screen diversity. The loss of diverse hosts, then, is more of an unintended consequence of the long-term reinvention of the channel. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cTVNewser has learned that Raelyn Johnson has been promoted to executive producer, MSNBC Weekends,\u201d A.J. Katz reported Friday for TVNewser. \u201cJohnson is presently a senior producer on the 3 p.m. MSNBC Live with Ali Velshi hour, and will transition into her new role over the next few weeks.\n\n\u201cPrior to joining MSNBC in November 2015, Johnson was as a senior producer with Al Jazeera America. She was one of the original team members to launch that network. . . .\u201d\n\n3 News Outlets Got Cold Feet on R. Kelly Story\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCall it the Gawker Effect,\u201d Margaret Sullivan wrote Sunday in the Washington Post.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter Jim DeRogatis, the veteran Chicago rock critic, reported for months on a stunning story about R&B singer R. Kelly and the young women said to be under his psychological and sexual control, it came time to get it published.\n\n\u201cThree separate media organizations were interested but got cold feet at the last minute, DeRogatis said. Each one, after investing months of work, backed away from the story that used named sources and documents to describe how women near Atlanta and Chicago were held as if in a cult, according to what parents and others had told police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(DeRogatis declined to name the news organizations because of his appreciation of the editors he worked with; they weren\u2019t the ones who pulled the plug. They include a regional print publication, a world-famous multimedia behemoth and a radio-based digital outlet.)\n\n\u201c \u2018Gawker came up in a lot of those conversations,\u2019 DeRogatis said, referring to the snarky and risk-taking website that was put out of business last summer after a lawsuit brought by Terry Bollea, also known as Hulk Hogan. The invasion-of-privacy suit was bankrolled by billionaire Peter Thiel, a confidant of President Trump.\n\n\u201c \u2018Nobody wanted to take that risk.\u2019\n\n\u201cDeRogatis has pursued the R. Kelly story doggedly, first writing about it well over a decade ago and taking the Fifth Amendment in a subsequent trial rather than reveal his sources. (The longtime rock critic for the Chicago Sun-Times, DeRogatis also had a brief stint with Rolling Stone magazine; he was famously fired after he complained publicly that publisher Jann Wenner had killed his pan of a Hootie and the Blowfish album.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018This is a tawdry, sickening tale,\u2019 he told me. In an interview with Vox, he described the \u2018rape culture\u2019 he believes is the underlying story.\n\n\u201cUltimately, DeRogatis turned to a fourth outlet, BuzzFeed, which published the jaw-dropping story this month under the headline \u2018Inside the Pied Piper of R&B\u2019s \u201cCult.\u201d \u2018\n\n\u201c \u2018When we pursue a story, our primary concern is whether it\u2019s accurate and newsworthy \u2014 not whether the subject is too rich or powerful, be it Russian oligarchs, R. Kelly or the Trump White House,\u2019 said BuzzFeed spokesman Matt Mittenthal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not just a question of having what DeRogatis calls \u2018major cojones.\u2019 BuzzFeed\u2019s lawyers managed to make the story bulletproof, or apparently so, since there has been no challenge to its facts, not even a request for a minor correction. (Kelly has publicly insisted that there\u2019s no truth that he runs a cult or anything like it.)\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty and fear out there, post-Gawker, said Nabiha Syed, BuzzFeed\u2019s assistant general counsel, who vetted the story before publication. . . .\u201d\n\nTMZ: R.

Sometimes, the criticism to the criticism goes even further, and racially-tinged epithets like coon, sellout, and negro bed wench are spat in their direction. And then the wagons already circling around the man in question become reinforced with a coat of self-righteous kevlar. They must protect and defend this man from both the racist and the intra-racial attacks on his actions and character.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you've been on any predominately Black digital space this year when Lavar Ball or Umar Johnson or Bill Cosby or R. Kelly were discussed, you've undoubtedly seen it. You might have even been surprised by the number of Black people (men and women) willing to die very public and very stupid deaths on the Cosby and Kelly and Ball and Johnson hills. And, you might have been the target of their vehemence.\n\n(Before I continue, just want to make clear that there's a huge difference between what Cosby/Kelly have been accused of doing and Ball/Johnson \u2014 neither of whom, as far as I know, have been accused of heinous crimes. I put them together because they're each very high profile Black men, and the types of criticism aimed at the people who criticize them are similar.)\n\nAs someone who has been on the receiving end of the criticism of the criticism \u2014 just last week, someone on Facebook pointed to a piece I wrote about #TeamLawrence as evidence I'm ghostwriting for the Rothchilds (or something) \u2014 I'll admit that it bothers me. The names themselves don't matter much to me. You call me a coon or a sellout, and I'll shrug my shoulders and bite a pancake. My annoyance is more about their abject lack of self-awareness. While they're accusing us of being anti-Black, they're the ones allowing racial stereotypes to dictate their thoughts and actions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo wit, a common response to the criticism of Lavar Ball's ridiculous bombast is that we're trying to sabotage \"the one brotha who's standing up for his kids.\" And the \"rare Black man willing to challenge White people.\" And \"one of the only Black dads out there so active in their kids' lives.\"\n\nBut \u2014 and take this whichever way you want \u2014 Lavar aint special. Yes, his sons are special basketball players. And he has a special, Trumpian gift for shamelessness and self-promotion. But there are hundred of thousands of Black dads who stand up for their sons just like he does. And are willing to challenge White people just like he does. And are just as active in their kids' lives as he is. The only difference between Lavar Ball and literally any Black dad you can find doing Mikan drills with his son or daughter on a YMCA court today is that Lavar has a megaphone. A megaphone we only bother listening to because his sons are great players.\n\nExcusing his fuckshit and defending him as some rare and precious jewel of Black manhood and Black fatherhood implicitly agrees with the worst stereotypes about Black men and Black fathers. That we're so rare that Lavar Ball has to be handled like the Hope fucking Diamond. The same could be said about Umar Johnson. Who's defended like he's The Last Airbender, when I can personally name, right now without Google, (at least) 40 real actual Black men with real actual PhDs who are knowledgable about race and racism and unafraid to confront Whiteness and aren't misogynists and homophobes and haven't used GoFundMe donations to buy Muscle Milk and Bigen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, this defense is what happens when you've allowed what the world expects of Black men to exist as your standard. You start believing the hype \u2014 insisting that A Black Man Doing A Thing is so isolated and rarefied that it's worth excusing all the terrible just to preserve the talent. And while this train of thought might possess the veneer of pro-Blackness, it's actually pervasively anti-Black, as the coddling suggests that these men aren't able to be better people. Like it's impossible for us to be talented and not terrible.\n\nAnd yea, it's true that there are countless forces out there actively trying to kill us. Police. Donald Trump. Darth Susans. Office potlucks. And we need as much protection from them as we can get.
