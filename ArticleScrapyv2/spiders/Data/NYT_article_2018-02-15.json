In 2014, it broadcast daily highlights from the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, although none of its athletes competed there. That makes the absence of Olympic broadcasting in the North all the more conspicuous this year.\n\n\u201cThe last thing the North Korean authorities want is for its people to envy the South,\u201d said Jung Gwang-il, a North Korean defector.\n\nLike its former socialist allies, North Korea has recognized the role of sports in reasserting what it calls the country\u2019s ideological superiority. When its athletes returned home with golds, it honored them with car parades and rewards, like new apartments. The most celebrated example was Jong Song-ok, who won the World Championships marathon in Spain in 1999.\n\nMs. Jong famously said she won because while running, she imagined Kim Jong-il, then North Korea\u2019s leader, \u201cbeckoning me from the finish line.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Kim, the father of the current leader, made her a \u201chero of the republic,\u201d the highest honor in the country, for lifting the morale of his people still, in the grip of a devastating famine. (Defectors from the North later relayed a different story: Ms. Jong, sent to Spain as a pacemaker for another North Korean runner, ran for the life of her father, who was in prison.)\n\nThis year, Kim Jong-un has no athlete who can glorify him as Ms. Jong did his father.\n\nNorth Korea has won only two medals in the Winter Olympics, a silver in speedskating in 1964 and a bronze in short-track speedskating in 1992. The International Olympic Committee granted the 22 North Koreans at the current games last-minute exemptions to compete in five sports in Pyeongchang, including a dozen who joined the South Korean women\u2019s ice hockey squad to create the first inter-Korean Olympic team ever. None is expected to stand on a medal podium.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nBut Mr. Kim had quite a different goal for the Olympics, analysts said.\n\nWhen he used his New Year\u2019s Day speech to propose sending North Korean athletes to the Olympics, it was clear that his interest was not in Olympic golds but in creating a political d\u00e9tente so he could weaken international sanctions imposed on his country. At home, he described his decision as an act of magnanimity.\n\nSouth Koreans \u201care so grateful to us for giving a helping hand to their Winter Games, which were at the risk of becoming the least popular Olympics in history because of the political situation,\u201d the North\u2019s official newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, said last month.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSouth Korea has repeatedly urged North Korea to join the Olympics, hoping that its participation would help ease tensions and help make the games a success. That created an opening for Mr. Kim to engage in what critics called a \u201ccharm offensive.\u201d\n\nMr. Kim sent hundreds of cheerleaders, musicians and singers to the Games to supplement his meager sports contingent. They stole much of the show on the sidelines of the games. He also sent the most unusual Olympic guest: his sister, whose visit to the South, including meetings with President Moon Jae-in, created a media frenzy. Ms. Kim delivered her brother\u2019s invitation for Mr. Moon to visit the North for a summit meeting, raising hopes for a d\u00e9tente, as Mr. Kim intended.\n\n\u201cKim Jong-un didn\u2019t really have anyone to send to the Olympics, except for his cheerleaders and singers,\u201d said Joo Sung-ha, a North Korean defector who works as a reporter for the mass-circulation South Korean daily Dong-A Ilbo. \u201cThey were the best card he had.\u201d\n\nThe state-run North Korean news outlets covering the Olympics focused on these nonsports activities to highlight Mr. Kim\u2019s inter-Korean initiative.\n\nThey carried front-page reports on his sister\u2019s visit. They told North Koreans that their arts troupe performed to \u201cpacked audiences\u201d in the South. They also reported the North Korean cheerleaders rooting for the joint Korean ice hockey team but did not mention that it lost 8-0 to Switzerland and Sweden. The team also lost 4-1 to Japan, the Koreans\u2019 historical enemy, on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cKim Jong-un did not look for Olympic golds in the first place,\u201d said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul. \u201cHis aim was to use the Olympics to create a mood for dialogue in order to head off sanctions and pressure and to soften his country\u2019s negative image. And he has been more successful there than he hoped for.\u201d", "keywords": ["korea", "actually", "north", "olympic", "south", "cant", "olympics", "kim", "mr", "games", "watch", "koreans", "korean"], "polarity": 0.12146861471861473, "subjectivity": 0.39029220779220775},

Lee cried as he photographed the opening of the Winter Olympic Games.\n\nHe had grown up in Busan, South Korea, where his parents rarely spoke about the war that cleaved his homeland in two. His mother had fled the North, leaving behind family members; his paternal uncle was never seen again after being taken prisoner by the North. In elementary school, his teachers had him draw posters and write essays against the communists.\n\nNow, in an emotional homecoming he could never have imagined, Mr. Lee has returned to cover the Winter Games for The New York Times. Even harder to believe was the sight of a unified team of women hockey players from North and South Korea as they entered the stadium.\n\nImage North Korea supporters during the game between the unified Korean team and Switzerland at Kwandong Hockey Center.

Lee/The New York Times\n\n\u201cWe are the same people,\u201d Mr. Lee said in a phone call from Korea this week. \u201cUnification will probably not happen anytime soon but we don\u2019t have to be literally unified to be able to communicate with our relatives on the other side and have activities together.\u201d\n\nThese are the eighth Olympics Mr. Lee has covered for The New York Times, even though he had little interest in sports when he moved to the United States after a semester of college. And even though the 1988 Summer Games were in Seoul, he didn\u2019t have the time to watch them on television, since he was busy delivering pizzas in New Jersey to pay his way through English classes. He just knew something big was happening.\n\n\u201cI heard people screaming from their homes,\u201d he recalled. \u201cBut I was just delivering the pizza.\u201d\n\nHe went on to study photography at New York University and landed a photo internship at The Times in 1994 before being promoted to staff photographer a few months later. And though he started with little knowledge of many American sports, he quickly became an expert sports photographer. He covered his first Olympics in Nagano, Japan, in 1998, where the spectacle and the drama motivated him to photograph as many Olympic Games as possible ever since.\n\nImage Adam Rippon of the United States during the men\u2019s singles free skate, on the final day of the team figure skating competition. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\n\u201cI love to cover the Olympics because it\u2019s really about human drama,\u201d he said. \u201cThese athletes go through extreme hardship and devote so much of their lives to compete in a short period of time that will define their career. To witness that and to be able to capture those moments is a great gift to me and a privilege to be able to do it.\u201d\n\nHis obsession with capturing the perfect moment at the Olympics at times rivals the obsession of the athletes themselves. Two thirds of his job, he said, is making sure everything is working so he can actually take the pictures the rest of the time.\n\nAt these Olympics, his focus will be on figure skating and ice hockey. Mr. Lee has set up two remote cameras at the skating arena and two more at the hockey rink. He had already scouted the figure skating venue in Pyeongchang a year ago in order to familiarize himself with the location. He also went to the American figure skating trials in order to study the athletes and their routines.\n\nImage Shaun White of the United States during the men\u2019s halfpipe qualification rounds at Phoenix Snow Park, PyeongChang.

Lee/The New York Times\n\nTo successfully photograph the Olympics, he said, you have to plan, prepare and \u201cwant it more than anyone else and never give up,\u201d two traits he knows well from his personal journey.\n\nPlanning and patience may be the foundation, but once the event begins, instinct takes over. There is a purely meditative aspect to being a great sports photographer and a feeling of being solely in the moment. Anticipation is critical for capturing the moments that happen so fast.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really being able to see what\u2019s going to happen before it happens,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cIf you wait until you see it with your own eyes, many times it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nImage North Korean figure skaters Kim Ju-Sik and Ryom Tae-Ok during a practice session.

In the finals, athletes crashed or essentially gave up on 41 of 50 runs. Some approached the big jumps at full speed, only to pull up at the last moment because snow made it impossible to see or the wind socks on the jumps were completely stiffened. Tess Coady of Australia blamed the wind for a knee injury sustained in a training run before the competition.\n\n\u201cGot picked up in the wind on the bottom jump in practice and my ACL was not a big fan!\u201d she wrote on Instagram.\n\nSeveral miles away on Monday, the women\u2019s giant slalom competition was postponed, just as the men\u2019s downhill had been the day before. (They both ultimately took place on Thursday, the first somewhat still day of the Games.)\n\nIt threw off training cycles and complicated the hopes of skiers like Mikaela Shiffrin, the American star who is aiming to win multiple gold medals. Because of the wind, she faced three straight days of races, hardly ideal.\n\nFor most of a week, the blowing snow created white-out conditions on the ski courses. Gondolas tilted uncomfortably in the wind, and chair lifts were shut down. Race flags were blown off their poles. Mislaid gloves blew away.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut wind is a fickle foe to plenty of winter sports, and it has affected all of the outdoor events. On the biathlon course, it was even harder than usual to shoot straight. At the ski jump, the 45-year-old veteran Noriaki Kasai of Japan said he had rarely felt such strong wind at a competition.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wind howls so loud it\u2019s frightening being up there.\u201d\n\nThe wind even put a scare into spectators milling around the complex of ice arenas close to the coast.\n\n\u201cDue to high winds in the Gangneung area, all activities in the common domain of the Gangneung Olympic Park have been temporarily suspended to ensure the safety of all personnel,\u201d the Pyeongchang Olympic Committee wrote in a statement Wednesday afternoon, as temporary tents, booths and fences were upended and blown over in a sudden burst. According to Reuters, 13 volunteers and three spectators receiving minor injuries from flying debris and 60 tents were damaged.\n\nThe area was closed and fans shooed away.

In the late 1990s, South Korea dropped its bans against Japanese films, videos and comic books, and began allowing Japanese performers into the country. In 2002, when the countries co-hosted the World Cup, even after Japan\u2019s team was eliminated, fans rooted for South Korea.\n\nBut under Mr. Abe, the relationship between the countries has deteriorated. In 2013, Mr. Abe\u2019s party proposed new language for school textbooks that inserted a more nationalist tone, requiring the history books state that there is still a dispute about whether the Japanese Army played a direct role in forcing so-called comfort women from Korea and elsewhere to work as sex slaves for its soldiers. Most foreign historians say the brothels could not have been run without the military\u2019s cooperation.\n\nThe countries signed an agreement in 2015 to resolve the comfort women dispute, but after the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, was elected last fall, he pledged to review the deal. In January, Mr. Moon said he would leave the deal intact, but he called for a renewed and sincere apology from Japan, a declaration that provoked frustration in Tokyo. At a summit meeting with Mr. Moon immediately before the start of the Olympics, Mr. Abe reiterated Japan\u2019s position that the 2015 agreement should be \u201cfinal and irreversible.\u201d\n\nBut it was the presence of North Korea that has threatened to open the biggest gap between Japan and the South.", "keywords": ["korea", "south", "olympics", "ice", "japans", "unified", "newsletter", "mr", "politics", "beats", "air", "fans", "goals", "team", "korean", "japan", "japanese"], "polarity": 0.0883353825661518, "subjectivity": 0.3334106064875295},

Vonn seems at ease as she waits for her Olympic journey to begin, apparently on time and as scheduled.\n\nPhoto\n\nVonn appears to have spent Wednesday hunting for love on Twitter.\n\nShiffrin would also like to enter one or two more events next week. But that was a plan from a week ago. Back then, the notion that Shiffrin would chase medals in five Olympic events seemed more plausible because the races were evenly spaced across 12 days, not wedged into nine, action-packed days.\n\nFor nearly a year now, Shiffrin expected to be done with roughly half of her odyssey at the Pyeongchang Olympics by nightfall on Wednesday. In the best-case scenario, she would have swept two of her best events, or at least earned a medal in both. Then in the second week she would play with house money, especially since she would be a clear favorite in the final individual race of the Olympics, the women\u2019s Alpine combined, which is one downhill and one slalom run.\n\nInstead, she is still being held back, like a skier in the start gate prohibited from pushing past the timing wand to start a race.\n\nThe silver lining is Shiffrin probably stood to benefit the most from the postponements. The winds sweeping through northeastern South Korea would have made the slalom and the giant slalom races either unsafe or unfair. If officials had held Wednesday\u2019s race, an ill-timed uphill gust could have doomed her chance at a medal.

Weather delays and postponements are just the nature of an outdoor sport.\u201d\n\nIn that perspective, Shiffrin may have evaded a much worse fate, which would be a defeat caused not by anything she did or did not do, but by a bad break. And afterward, Shiffrin would have had to accept that outcome because blaming the weather for a loss would only come off as an excuse.\n\nIn the meantime, she waits.

Alpine skiing consists of the traditional events in which skiers race down a hill: the slalom, the giant slalom, the downhill. Freestyle skiing is the newest discipline, with skiers spinning and flipping in the halfpipe or over moguls.\n\nThat leaves the Nordic events, specifically defined as ones in which athletes\u2019 heels are not affixed to the skis. The two main Nordic events are quite different: cross-country skiing, which requires endurance, and ski jumping, the daredevil event that rewards courage, aerodynamic form and a slight body.\n\nSo why not take these two disparate events and combine them? That\u2019s Nordic combined.\n\nSkiers start by taking two ski jumps, scoring points for distance and style. Next up is a 10-kilometer cross-country race.

Midway through his run he lost his balance, went upright in the middle of the jump and landed on the back of his skis 20 feet down the hill. Svindal somehow regained his stability though and ended up gaining speed on the relatively flat and winding third quarter of the course where so many other races were losing time.\n\nAt nearly 6 feet 3 inches and 220 pounds, Svindal had gravity on his side and crossed the finish line at 1 minute 40.25 seconds, besting the time Feuz had posted just minutes earlier.

Chief among them: Can the new opening between the two Koreas, begun amid the feel-good spirit of the Winter Games, be nudged and nurtured into serious dialogue over North Korea\u2019s nuclear program?\n\nWhile still a long shot, there\u2019s a somewhat better chance of engagement now owing to two developments since President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, Vice President Mike Pence, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and the North Korean delegation, including Kim Yo-jong, the only sister of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, attended the Olympic opening ceremony.\n\nFirst was Mr. Kim\u2019s surprise decision to dispatch his sister, his most trusted envoy, to carry his personal invitation for Mr. Moon to join him in a summit meeting in the North. Mr. Moon and Ms. Kim met four times during the Olympics, the highest-level contact between the two Koreas in years. Mr. Moon\u2019s visit would be an even rarer event, since the reclusive Mr. Kim has never met another foreign leader.\n\nWhile many officials fear that North Korea\u2019s primary goal is to drive a wedge between South Korea, which has been eager to engage the North, and the United States, which has resisted engagement, close coordination between Washington and Seoul would keep the alliance strong.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the very least, the North-South contacts provide a communications channel for Seoul to directly explain to Pyongyang what it and the United States are doing and saying and why, thus hopefully avoiding any miscalculation that could lead to military confrontations in this fraught period.", "keywords": ["korea", "united", "north", "moon", "south", "peace", "giving", "kim", "trouble", "sister", "mr", "states", "koreas", "causing", "chance"], "polarity": 0.09341354723707664, "subjectivity": 0.4744830659536542},

Podladtchikov, 29, participated in one practice at Phoenix Snow Park before releasing a statement saying it was \u201cin no way safe or responsible\u201d for him to compete. On Twitter, Podladtchikov wrote, \u201cUnfortunately, my brain needs time to recover from the bruises and I will not be able to compete.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nA gloom fell over the halfpipe on Wednesday when 16-year-old Yuto Totsuka, the youngest finalist, ricocheted off the wall during his second run and spun out. He landed hard on his side, injuring his hip. He was tended to by paramedics, who immobilized him on a sled and carted him off the course. Japan\u2019s team manager said Totsuka was conscious and had been taken to a nearby hospital. His injuries were not deemed to be serious.\n\nThe day before the men\u2019s final, the 17-year-old American Chloe Kim performed two 1080s \u2014 as White had 12 years before \u2014 on her way to the gold in the women\u2019s halfpipe. During her runs, Kim\u2019s family members watched anxiously from the bottom of the hill. Asked which trick made her the most apprehensive, Kim\u2019s mother, Boran Yun, said, \u201cthe whole run, from the beginning to the end.\u201d\n\nWhile Kim celebrated, one of her fellow teenage competitors, Emily Arthur of Australia, assessed the damage after she face-planted near the end of her third run. Arthur, 18, who finished 11th, remained facedown in the snow for several seconds before she shakily got back on her feet. She had a bloodied nose, a swollen lip and a swollen eye, and she said her head hurt, but she later told an Australia Channel 7 reporter, \u201cI\u2019m good and I\u2019m alive.\u201d\n\nRoughly 7,000 miles away, Kevin Pearce was rattled by Arthur\u2019s fall as he watched the final from his home in Vermont. \u201cIt looked so bad that I just hope she takes it seriously enough and gets the help she needs,\u201d Pearce said in a telephone interview.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAccording to an Australian team official, Arthur was checked by a team doctor, who didn\u2019t believe she had suffered a concussion but said that she would be monitored for the next 36 hours.\n\nArthur\u2019s crash reminded him of a bad spill that he walked away from during a U.S. qualifier before the 2010 Games. For the next several days his head didn\u2019t feel right, Pearce said, but he kept his symptoms \u2014 nausea, sluggishness and mental fogginess \u2014 to himself. He was expected to challenge White for the gold medal at the Vancouver Games, and he did not want to jeopardize his chances of making the Olympics.\n\nLess than two weeks later, Pearce sustained a traumatic brain injury during a training crash. He remained in a coma for weeks. In retrospect, he said, he believes that he sustained a concussion in the earlier fall and that it contributed to the later crash that ended his competitive career.\n\nAfter Podladtchikov, known as IPod, pulled out of the Olympics, Pearce wrote him a message on Instagram with praise for the wisdom and courage \u201cto give up a shot at another gold medal. To me, it was unbelievable that he was able to know that his head wasn\u2019t in the right place.\u201d\n\nPearce hoped Arthur would show the same prudence. \u201cI just hope she can take it from people like myself and IPod and take care,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the brain, you just never know if you\u2019re O.K. until it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nPearce and his older brother Adam, whom he followed into snowboarding, have called for a concussion-management protocol that would require young athletes to undergo baseline testing \u2014 a computerized assessment that measures reaction time, memory capacity, speed of mental processing, and executive functioning of the brain. Then, if they crash, they can be tested and have those scores compared with their baseline numbers.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not saying that snowboarding is too dangerous,\u201d Adam Pearce said in a telephone interview, \u201cbut there has to be common sense. Why can\u2019t there be more attention paid to when things maybe don\u2019t go right?\u201d\n\nIn the aftermath of his crash, the Pearce brothers established a nonprofit organization, LoveYourBrain, to raise brain health awareness. Kevin Pearce, 30, still experiences double vision, but his sight has improved enough that he recently was able to ditch the corrective glasses that he had been wearing for the past eight years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMarch is Brain Injury Awareness Month, and Pearce and his brother have been preparing for international programs aimed at cultivating resilience and community through yoga, Pearce\u2019s latest passion. \u201cI think it\u2019s so awesome to take that time out of the day to be mindful,\u201d he said, \u201cand I don\u2019t believe I\u2019d be saying this right now if I was getting ready to compete in the Olympics. That\u2019s not where my head was.\u201d\n\nPearce and his brother, who is vacationing in the Bahamas, planned to FaceTime during the men\u2019s halfpipe final. Pearce said he could put himself back in their boots, \u201cbeing at your most nervous place ever in your life and then throwing down the most gnarly tricks.\u201d\n\nHee wouldn\u2019t trade places with any of them. Not even his former rival White, whose longevity and steely composure under pressure amaze him, but, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how many people benefited from me when I was snowboarding, how many lives were impacted by my tricks.

NBC Uses a Tricky Head Count                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/sports/olympics/olympics-nbc-viewers-digital.html", "text": "With billions of dollars in commercial time at stake, content providers, and especially media companies that own expensive sports rights, have raced to keep up. Scripted programming can have a long shelf life and be sold over time in a variety of ways, but the vast majority of sports is watched live, which means broadcasters need to capture every viewer possible and figure out how to count them.\n\nThe catch is that they aren\u2019t yet in agreement on how to do that.\n\n\u201cIn order for the industry to move forward, we have to coalesce around a single-source approach,\u201d said Cary Meyers, head of ESPN\u2019s consumer-research division, where the network is working directly with Nielsen on a live audience metric that would be a different version of TAD.\n\nNBC appears unwilling to take any chances with the Winter Games, particularly after facing an unexpected decline in traditional, or \u201clinear,\u201d TV ratings in Rio, when it had to offer free commercial time to advertisers to meet its ratings guarantees. Streaming surged during that period.\n\nLinda Yaccarino, NBC Universal\u2019s head of ad sales, has been a vocal critic of Nielsen in recent years, saying that the measurement company\u2019s methods don\u2019t accurately count all the new ways people are watching its shows. Network complaints have grown louder as the legacy media companies battle falling ratings and new competition for ad dollars from the likes of Facebook and YouTube, which is owned by Google.\n\nNielsen ratings for traditional television are based upon averaging every minute of viewing by a representative panel. NBC combines Nielsen\u2019s measures for its television channels with Adobe\u2019s measurement of streaming data to form TAD.\n\nAdvertising technology is changing constantly, and Nielsen has to carefully decide when a metric is ready for mainstream adoption. Megan Clarken, Nielsen\u2019s president of United States media (and at one time an Olympic-qualifying long jumper), said that a decade ago the company faced pressure to enter mobile measurement. If it had done so, Nielsen would have been pushing ultimately useless metrics to measure viewing on BlackBerry phones.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhat we do as a company is we watch for that activity, that evolution,\u201d she said, \u201cand what we aim to do is not be ahead of it, but be with it, and certainly not behind it.\u201d\n\nWhile analysts said it was smart of NBC to push its own metric for the Games, it is also the right move for Nielsen to proceed carefully as it develops an industry standard for tracking viewers across a \u201cdizzying array\u201d of consumer devices in the digital world, said Dave Morgan, the founder and chief executive of Simulmedia.\n\n\u201cEverybody in the digital video industry is pretty much in agreement that 30 to 40 percent of the ad impressions that are delivered out there don\u2019t really exist,\u201d said Mr. Morgan, whose firm works with brands on targeted TV ads. \u201cYet nobody would say 30 to 40 percent of TV\u2019s viewing audience doesn\u2019t exist. So I think Nielsen is very, very afraid of going into a Wild West environment where it is wide open to fraud and bots.\u201d\n\nAccording to Nielsen, while measuring authentic digital viewing is difficult, it is no more difficult than doing so for television. But despite the ambiguity of the measuring sticks, advertisers don\u2019t want to miss an opportunity to impress a mass audience over 17 days.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t necessarily want to sit on the sidelines because, \u2018Hey \u2014 funky measurement,\u2019\u201d said Gibbs Haljun, managing director of media investment at GroupM, the media-buying arm of WPP. \u201cThat sort of defeats the point of what they\u2019re trying to do.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story 2018 Olympics Newsletter For 19 days, our Sports newsletter will be all things Olympics.

The Olympics are a unique property, with thousands of hours of programming playing out on broadcast and cable channels, unlike a hit drama like \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d which would never be shown across a broadcast and cable channel simultaneously.\n\nThe Olympics is the perfect petri dish for audience measurement,\u201d said Mr. Lovinger of NBC. The network\u2019s traditional television ratings during the Rio Games were down 15 percent compared with the London Games four years earlier, and since the network had made separate linear and digital ratings guarantees for Rio, it was left \u201cwithout the ability to manage delivery across the Games,\u201d Mr. Lovinger said.\n\n\u201cYou look at the Olympics in Rio and you look at the kind of decline in linear television viewing and the supplement of digital viewing, either simultaneous or delayed, and it is obviously a material difference,\u201d said David Cohen, president of North America at Magna Global, a major ad-buying firm.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo far, TAD seems to be doing its job. Across the first four nights of the Olympics, ratings for NBC only were down 15 percent from the comparable nights in Sochi four years ago. But the total audience was down just 7 percent. NBC said it is meeting its ratings guarantees, and has begun selling extra ad inventory that it had held back in case of falling short.\n\nMr. Haljun said that the timing is right for NBC\u2019s metric this year, but doesn\u2019t see it as a long-term solution.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at this weird point where people agree there needs to be a certified third-party number that\u2019s comparable across networks,\u201d Mr. Haijun said.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re in the early days of getting there,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople are doing different things and have disagreements on the best way to do this.\u201d", "keywords": ["digital", "measurement", "head", "audience", "nbc", "olympics", "nielsen", "count", "television", "viewing", "games", "tricky", "watching", "uses", "ratings"], "polarity": 0.0846359592788164, "subjectivity": 0.5105739498596641},

The most celebrated example was Jong Song-ok, who won the World Championships marathon in Spain in 1999.\n\nMs. Jong famously said she won because while running, she imagined Kim Jong-il, then North Korea\u2019s leader, \u201cbeckoning me from the finish line.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Kim, the father of the current leader, made her a \u201chero of the republic,\u201d the highest honor in the country, for lifting the morale of his people still, in the grip of a devastating famine. (Defectors from the North later relayed a different story: Ms. Jong, sent to Spain as a pacemaker for another North Korean runner, ran for the life of her father, who was in prison.)\n\nThis year, Kim Jong-un has no athlete who can glorify him as Ms. Jong did his father.\n\nNorth Korea has won only two medals in the Winter Olympics, a silver in speedskating in 1964 and a bronze in short-track speedskating in 1992. The International Olympic Committee granted the 22 North Koreans at the current games last-minute exemptions to compete in five sports in Pyeongchang, including a dozen who joined the South Korean women\u2019s ice hockey squad to create the first inter-Korean Olympic team ever. None is expected to stand on a medal podium.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

At home, he described his decision as an act of magnanimity.\n\nSouth Koreans \u201care so grateful to us for giving a helping hand to their Winter Games, which were at the risk of becoming the least popular Olympics in history because of the political situation,\u201d the North\u2019s official newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, said last month.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSouth Korea has repeatedly urged North Korea to join the Olympics, hoping that its participation would help ease tensions and help make the games a success. That created an opening for Mr. Kim to engage in what critics called a \u201ccharm offensive.\u201d\n\nMr. Kim sent hundreds of cheerleaders, musicians and singers to the Games to supplement his meager sports contingent. They stole much of the show on the sidelines of the games. He also sent the most unusual Olympic guest: his sister, whose visit to the South, including meetings with President Moon Jae-in, created a media frenzy. Ms. Kim delivered her brother\u2019s invitation for Mr. Moon to visit the North for a summit meeting, raising hopes for a d\u00e9tente, as Mr. Kim intended.\n\n\u201cKim Jong-un didn\u2019t really have anyone to send to the Olympics, except for his cheerleaders and singers,\u201d said Joo Sung-ha, a North Korean defector who works as a reporter for the mass-circulation South Korean daily Dong-A Ilbo. \u201cThey were the best card he had.\u201d\n\nThe state-run North Korean news outlets covering the Olympics focused on these nonsports activities to highlight Mr. Kim\u2019s inter-Korean initiative.\n\nThey carried front-page reports on his sister\u2019s visit. They told North Koreans that their arts troupe performed to \u201cpacked audiences\u201d in the South. They also reported the North Korean cheerleaders rooting for the joint Korean ice hockey team but did not mention that it lost 8-0 to Switzerland and Sweden. The team also lost 4-1 to Japan, the Koreans\u2019 historical enemy, on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cKim Jong-un did not look for Olympic golds in the first place,\u201d said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul. \u201cHis aim was to use the Olympics to create a mood for dialogue in order to head off sanctions and pressure and to soften his country\u2019s negative image.

Lee cried as he photographed the opening of the Winter Olympic Games.\n\nHe had grown up in Busan, South Korea, where his parents rarely spoke about the war that cleaved his homeland in two. His mother had fled the North, leaving behind family members; his paternal uncle was never seen again after being taken prisoner by the North. In elementary school, his teachers had him draw posters and write essays against the communists.\n\nNow, in an emotional homecoming he could never have imagined, Mr. Lee has returned to cover the Winter Games for The New York Times. Even harder to believe was the sight of a unified team of women hockey players from North and South Korea as they entered the stadium.\n\nImage North Korea supporters during the game between the unified Korean team and Switzerland at Kwandong Hockey Center.

And even though the 1988 Summer Games were in Seoul, he didn\u2019t have the time to watch them on television, since he was busy delivering pizzas in New Jersey to pay his way through English classes. He just knew something big was happening.\n\n\u201cI heard people screaming from their homes,\u201d he recalled. \u201cBut I was just delivering the pizza.\u201d\n\nHe went on to study photography at New York University and landed a photo internship at The Times in 1994 before being promoted to staff photographer a few months later. And though he started with little knowledge of many American sports, he quickly became an expert sports photographer. He covered his first Olympics in Nagano, Japan, in 1998, where the spectacle and the drama motivated him to photograph as many Olympic Games as possible ever since.\n\nImage Adam Rippon of the United States during the men\u2019s singles free skate, on the final day of the team figure skating competition. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\n\u201cI love to cover the Olympics because it\u2019s really about human drama,\u201d he said. \u201cThese athletes go through extreme hardship and devote so much of their lives to compete in a short period of time that will define their career. To witness that and to be able to capture those moments is a great gift to me and a privilege to be able to do it.\u201d\n\nHis obsession with capturing the perfect moment at the Olympics at times rivals the obsession of the athletes themselves. Two thirds of his job, he said, is making sure everything is working so he can actually take the pictures the rest of the time.\n\nAt these Olympics, his focus will be on figure skating and ice hockey. Mr. Lee has set up two remote cameras at the skating arena and two more at the hockey rink. He had already scouted the figure skating venue in Pyeongchang a year ago in order to familiarize himself with the location. He also went to the American figure skating trials in order to study the athletes and their routines.\n\nImage Shaun White of the United States during the men\u2019s halfpipe qualification rounds at Phoenix Snow Park, PyeongChang.

There is a purely meditative aspect to being a great sports photographer and a feeling of being solely in the moment. Anticipation is critical for capturing the moments that happen so fast.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really being able to see what\u2019s going to happen before it happens,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cIf you wait until you see it with your own eyes, many times it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nImage North Korean figure skaters Kim Ju-Sik and Ryom Tae-Ok during a practice session.

In the finals, athletes crashed or essentially gave up on 41 of 50 runs. Some approached the big jumps at full speed, only to pull up at the last moment because snow made it impossible to see or the wind socks on the jumps were completely stiffened.

(They both ultimately took place on Thursday, the first somewhat still day of the Games.)\n\nIt threw off training cycles and complicated the hopes of skiers like Mikaela Shiffrin, the American star who is aiming to win multiple gold medals. Because of the wind, she faced three straight days of races, hardly ideal.\n\nFor most of a week, the blowing snow created white-out conditions on the ski courses. Gondolas tilted uncomfortably in the wind, and chair lifts were shut down. Race flags were blown off their poles. Mislaid gloves blew away.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut wind is a fickle foe to plenty of winter sports, and it has affected all of the outdoor events.

In the late 1990s, South Korea dropped its bans against Japanese films, videos and comic books, and began allowing Japanese performers into the country. In 2002, when the countries co-hosted the World Cup, even after Japan\u2019s team was eliminated, fans rooted for South Korea.\n\nBut under Mr. Abe, the relationship between the countries has deteriorated. In 2013, Mr. Abe\u2019s party proposed new language for school textbooks that inserted a more nationalist tone, requiring the history books state that there is still a dispute about whether the Japanese Army played a direct role in forcing so-called comfort women from Korea and elsewhere to work as sex slaves for its soldiers. Most foreign historians say the brothels could not have been run without the military\u2019s cooperation.\n\nThe countries signed an agreement in 2015 to resolve the comfort women dispute, but after the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, was elected last fall, he pledged to review the deal. In January, Mr. Moon said he would leave the deal intact, but he called for a renewed and sincere apology from Japan, a declaration that provoked frustration in Tokyo. At a summit meeting with Mr. Moon immediately before the start of the Olympics, Mr. Abe reiterated Japan\u2019s position that the 2015 agreement should be \u201cfinal and irreversible.\u201d\n\nBut it was the presence of North Korea that has threatened to open the biggest gap between Japan and the South.", "keywords": ["korea", "south", "olympics", "ice", "japans", "unified", "newsletter", "mr", "politics", "beats", "air", "fans", "goals", "team", "korean", "japan", "japanese"], "polarity": 0.0883353825661518, "subjectivity": 0.3334106064875295},

Vonn seems at ease as she waits for her Olympic journey to begin, apparently on time and as scheduled.\n\nPhoto\n\nVonn appears to have spent Wednesday hunting for love on Twitter.\n\nShiffrin would also like to enter one or two more events next week. But that was a plan from a week ago. Back then, the notion that Shiffrin would chase medals in five Olympic events seemed more plausible because the races were evenly spaced across 12 days, not wedged into nine, action-packed days.\n\nFor nearly a year now, Shiffrin expected to be done with roughly half of her odyssey at the Pyeongchang Olympics by nightfall on Wednesday. In the best-case scenario, she would have swept two of her best events, or at least earned a medal in both. Then in the second week she would play with house money, especially since she would be a clear favorite in the final individual race of the Olympics, the women\u2019s Alpine combined, which is one downhill and one slalom run.\n\nInstead, she is still being held back, like a skier in the start gate prohibited from pushing past the timing wand to start a race.\n\nThe silver lining is Shiffrin probably stood to benefit the most from the postponements. The winds sweeping through northeastern South Korea would have made the slalom and the giant slalom races either unsafe or unfair. If officials had held Wednesday\u2019s race, an ill-timed uphill gust could have doomed her chance at a medal.

Weather delays and postponements are just the nature of an outdoor sport.\u201d\n\nIn that perspective, Shiffrin may have evaded a much worse fate, which would be a defeat caused not by anything she did or did not do, but by a bad break. And afterward, Shiffrin would have had to accept that outcome because blaming the weather for a loss would only come off as an excuse.\n\nIn the meantime, she waits.

Alpine skiing consists of the traditional events in which skiers race down a hill: the slalom, the giant slalom, the downhill. Freestyle skiing is the newest discipline, with skiers spinning and flipping in the halfpipe or over moguls.\n\nThat leaves the Nordic events, specifically defined as ones in which athletes\u2019 heels are not affixed to the skis. The two main Nordic events are quite different: cross-country skiing, which requires endurance, and ski jumping, the daredevil event that rewards courage, aerodynamic form and a slight body.\n\nSo why not take these two disparate events and combine them? That\u2019s Nordic combined.\n\nSkiers start by taking two ski jumps, scoring points for distance and style. Next up is a 10-kilometer cross-country race.

Midway through his run he lost his balance, went upright in the middle of the jump and landed on the back of his skis 20 feet down the hill. Svindal somehow regained his stability though and ended up gaining speed on the relatively flat and winding third quarter of the course where so many other races were losing time.\n\nAt nearly 6 feet 3 inches and 220 pounds, Svindal had gravity on his side and crossed the finish line at 1 minute 40.25 seconds, besting the time Feuz had posted just minutes earlier.

Chief among them: Can the new opening between the two Koreas, begun amid the feel-good spirit of the Winter Games, be nudged and nurtured into serious dialogue over North Korea\u2019s nuclear program?\n\nWhile still a long shot, there\u2019s a somewhat better chance of engagement now owing to two developments since President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, Vice President Mike Pence, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and the North Korean delegation, including Kim Yo-jong, the only sister of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, attended the Olympic opening ceremony.\n\nFirst was Mr. Kim\u2019s surprise decision to dispatch his sister, his most trusted envoy, to carry his personal invitation for Mr. Moon to join him in a summit meeting in the North. Mr. Moon and Ms. Kim met four times during the Olympics, the highest-level contact between the two Koreas in years. Mr. Moon\u2019s visit would be an even rarer event, since the reclusive Mr. Kim has never met another foreign leader.\n\nWhile many officials fear that North Korea\u2019s primary goal is to drive a wedge between South Korea, which has been eager to engage the North, and the United States, which has resisted engagement, close coordination between Washington and Seoul would keep the alliance strong.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the very least, the North-South contacts provide a communications channel for Seoul to directly explain to Pyongyang what it and the United States are doing and saying and why, thus hopefully avoiding any miscalculation that could lead to military confrontations in this fraught period.", "keywords": ["korea", "united", "north", "moon", "south", "peace", "giving", "kim", "trouble", "sister", "mr", "states", "koreas", "causing", "chance"], "polarity": 0.09341354723707664, "subjectivity": 0.4744830659536542},

Podladtchikov, 29, participated in one practice at Phoenix Snow Park before releasing a statement saying it was \u201cin no way safe or responsible\u201d for him to compete. On Twitter, Podladtchikov wrote, \u201cUnfortunately, my brain needs time to recover from the bruises and I will not be able to compete.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nA gloom fell over the halfpipe on Wednesday when 16-year-old Yuto Totsuka, the youngest finalist, ricocheted off the wall during his second run and spun out. He landed hard on his side, injuring his hip. He was tended to by paramedics, who immobilized him on a sled and carted him off the course. Japan\u2019s team manager said Totsuka was conscious and had been taken to a nearby hospital. His injuries were not deemed to be serious.\n\nThe day before the men\u2019s final, the 17-year-old American Chloe Kim performed two 1080s \u2014 as White had 12 years before \u2014 on her way to the gold in the women\u2019s halfpipe. During her runs, Kim\u2019s family members watched anxiously from the bottom of the hill. Asked which trick made her the most apprehensive, Kim\u2019s mother, Boran Yun, said, \u201cthe whole run, from the beginning to the end.\u201d\n\nWhile Kim celebrated, one of her fellow teenage competitors, Emily Arthur of Australia, assessed the damage after she face-planted near the end of her third run. Arthur, 18, who finished 11th, remained facedown in the snow for several seconds before she shakily got back on her feet. She had a bloodied nose, a swollen lip and a swollen eye, and she said her head hurt, but she later told an Australia Channel 7 reporter, \u201cI\u2019m good and I\u2019m alive.\u201d\n\nRoughly 7,000 miles away, Kevin Pearce was rattled by Arthur\u2019s fall as he watched the final from his home in Vermont. \u201cIt looked so bad that I just hope she takes it seriously enough and gets the help she needs,\u201d Pearce said in a telephone interview.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAccording to an Australian team official, Arthur was checked by a team doctor, who didn\u2019t believe she had suffered a concussion but said that she would be monitored for the next 36 hours.\n\nArthur\u2019s crash reminded him of a bad spill that he walked away from during a U.S. qualifier before the 2010 Games. For the next several days his head didn\u2019t feel right, Pearce said, but he kept his symptoms \u2014 nausea, sluggishness and mental fogginess \u2014 to himself. He was expected to challenge White for the gold medal at the Vancouver Games, and he did not want to jeopardize his chances of making the Olympics.\n\nLess than two weeks later, Pearce sustained a traumatic brain injury during a training crash. He remained in a coma for weeks. In retrospect, he said, he believes that he sustained a concussion in the earlier fall and that it contributed to the later crash that ended his competitive career.\n\nAfter Podladtchikov, known as IPod, pulled out of the Olympics, Pearce wrote him a message on Instagram with praise for the wisdom and courage \u201cto give up a shot at another gold medal. To me, it was unbelievable that he was able to know that his head wasn\u2019t in the right place.\u201d\n\nPearce hoped Arthur would show the same prudence. \u201cI just hope she can take it from people like myself and IPod and take care,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the brain, you just never know if you\u2019re O.K. until it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nPearce and his older brother Adam, whom he followed into snowboarding, have called for a concussion-management protocol that would require young athletes to undergo baseline testing \u2014 a computerized assessment that measures reaction time, memory capacity, speed of mental processing, and executive functioning of the brain. Then, if they crash, they can be tested and have those scores compared with their baseline numbers.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not saying that snowboarding is too dangerous,\u201d Adam Pearce said in a telephone interview, \u201cbut there has to be common sense. Why can\u2019t there be more attention paid to when things maybe don\u2019t go right?\u201d\n\nIn the aftermath of his crash, the Pearce brothers established a nonprofit organization, LoveYourBrain, to raise brain health awareness. Kevin Pearce, 30, still experiences double vision, but his sight has improved enough that he recently was able to ditch the corrective glasses that he had been wearing for the past eight years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMarch is Brain Injury Awareness Month, and Pearce and his brother have been preparing for international programs aimed at cultivating resilience and community through yoga, Pearce\u2019s latest passion. \u201cI think it\u2019s so awesome to take that time out of the day to be mindful,\u201d he said, \u201cand I don\u2019t believe I\u2019d be saying this right now if I was getting ready to compete in the Olympics. That\u2019s not where my head was.\u201d\n\nPearce and his brother, who is vacationing in the Bahamas, planned to FaceTime during the men\u2019s halfpipe final. Pearce said he could put himself back in their boots, \u201cbeing at your most nervous place ever in your life and then throwing down the most gnarly tricks.\u201d\n\nHee wouldn\u2019t trade places with any of them. Not even his former rival White, whose longevity and steely composure under pressure amaze him, but, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how many people benefited from me when I was snowboarding, how many lives were impacted by my tricks.

NBC Uses a Tricky Head Count                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/sports/olympics/olympics-nbc-viewers-digital.html", "text": "With billions of dollars in commercial time at stake, content providers, and especially media companies that own expensive sports rights, have raced to keep up. Scripted programming can have a long shelf life and be sold over time in a variety of ways, but the vast majority of sports is watched live, which means broadcasters need to capture every viewer possible and figure out how to count them.\n\nThe catch is that they aren\u2019t yet in agreement on how to do that.\n\n\u201cIn order for the industry to move forward, we have to coalesce around a single-source approach,\u201d said Cary Meyers, head of ESPN\u2019s consumer-research division, where the network is working directly with Nielsen on a live audience metric that would be a different version of TAD.\n\nNBC appears unwilling to take any chances with the Winter Games, particularly after facing an unexpected decline in traditional, or \u201clinear,\u201d TV ratings in Rio, when it had to offer free commercial time to advertisers to meet its ratings guarantees. Streaming surged during that period.\n\nLinda Yaccarino, NBC Universal\u2019s head of ad sales, has been a vocal critic of Nielsen in recent years, saying that the measurement company\u2019s methods don\u2019t accurately count all the new ways people are watching its shows. Network complaints have grown louder as the legacy media companies battle falling ratings and new competition for ad dollars from the likes of Facebook and YouTube, which is owned by Google.\n\nNielsen ratings for traditional television are based upon averaging every minute of viewing by a representative panel. NBC combines Nielsen\u2019s measures for its television channels with Adobe\u2019s measurement of streaming data to form TAD.\n\nAdvertising technology is changing constantly, and Nielsen has to carefully decide when a metric is ready for mainstream adoption. Megan Clarken, Nielsen\u2019s president of United States media (and at one time an Olympic-qualifying long jumper), said that a decade ago the company faced pressure to enter mobile measurement. If it had done so, Nielsen would have been pushing ultimately useless metrics to measure viewing on BlackBerry phones.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhat we do as a company is we watch for that activity, that evolution,\u201d she said, \u201cand what we aim to do is not be ahead of it, but be with it, and certainly not behind it.\u201d\n\nWhile analysts said it was smart of NBC to push its own metric for the Games, it is also the right move for Nielsen to proceed carefully as it develops an industry standard for tracking viewers across a \u201cdizzying array\u201d of consumer devices in the digital world, said Dave Morgan, the founder and chief executive of Simulmedia.\n\n\u201cEverybody in the digital video industry is pretty much in agreement that 30 to 40 percent of the ad impressions that are delivered out there don\u2019t really exist,\u201d said Mr. Morgan, whose firm works with brands on targeted TV ads. \u201cYet nobody would say 30 to 40 percent of TV\u2019s viewing audience doesn\u2019t exist. So I think Nielsen is very, very afraid of going into a Wild West environment where it is wide open to fraud and bots.\u201d\n\nAccording to Nielsen, while measuring authentic digital viewing is difficult, it is no more difficult than doing so for television. But despite the ambiguity of the measuring sticks, advertisers don\u2019t want to miss an opportunity to impress a mass audience over 17 days.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t necessarily want to sit on the sidelines because, \u2018Hey \u2014 funky measurement,\u2019\u201d said Gibbs Haljun, managing director of media investment at GroupM, the media-buying arm of WPP. \u201cThat sort of defeats the point of what they\u2019re trying to do.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story 2018 Olympics Newsletter For 19 days, our Sports newsletter will be all things Olympics.

The Olympics are a unique property, with thousands of hours of programming playing out on broadcast and cable channels, unlike a hit drama like \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d which would never be shown across a broadcast and cable channel simultaneously.\n\nThe Olympics is the perfect petri dish for audience measurement,\u201d said Mr. Lovinger of NBC. The network\u2019s traditional television ratings during the Rio Games were down 15 percent compared with the London Games four years earlier, and since the network had made separate linear and digital ratings guarantees for Rio, it was left \u201cwithout the ability to manage delivery across the Games,\u201d Mr. Lovinger said.\n\n\u201cYou look at the Olympics in Rio and you look at the kind of decline in linear television viewing and the supplement of digital viewing, either simultaneous or delayed, and it is obviously a material difference,\u201d said David Cohen, president of North America at Magna Global, a major ad-buying firm.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo far, TAD seems to be doing its job. Across the first four nights of the Olympics, ratings for NBC only were down 15 percent from the comparable nights in Sochi four years ago. But the total audience was down just 7 percent. NBC said it is meeting its ratings guarantees, and has begun selling extra ad inventory that it had held back in case of falling short.\n\nMr. Haljun said that the timing is right for NBC\u2019s metric this year, but doesn\u2019t see it as a long-term solution.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at this weird point where people agree there needs to be a certified third-party number that\u2019s comparable across networks,\u201d Mr. Haijun said.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re in the early days of getting there,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople are doing different things and have disagreements on the best way to do this.\u201d", "keywords": ["digital", "measurement", "head", "audience", "nbc", "olympics", "nielsen", "count", "television", "viewing", "games", "tricky", "watching", "uses", "ratings"], "polarity": 0.0846359592788164, "subjectivity": 0.5105739498596641},

As she often does while watching television, she checked Twitter and saw that Leslie Jones, the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d star who is live tweeting the Olympics for NBC, had the same reaction.\n\nMs. Jones has emerged as the Olympics\u2019 anti-announcer, funny and often salty, especially when it comes to the fashion, which, at its best, can be daring, and, its worst, well, she has her views.\n\n\u201cHe looks like the Nutcracker,\u201d Ms. Jones said of Mr. Rizzo in her spoken commentary, which often accompanies the phone video clips of the NBC broadcast. \u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nNothing escapes her sharp eye: not black gloves, not a skating pair in checkers (\u201cI don\u2019t even really know how to express the hate that I have\u201d), not even her and Johnny Weir\u2019s matching hairstyles.
