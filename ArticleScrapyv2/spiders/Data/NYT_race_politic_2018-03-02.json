And that uncertainty has reawakened old anxieties about the sincerity of his political promises. His next move on guns will test his relationship with one of the most loyal and powerful elements of his base.\n\nRepublican strategists say that movement in polling for tighter restrictions on gun sales has been notable among Republican voters, a shift that they say is because Mr. Trump has spoken out about it \u2014 he is probably the only major figure who can move Republican voters on an issue.\n\nBut the president\u2019s connection with gun owners and their culture \u2014 which is infused with a sense of mistrust and grievance that he both feeds on and shares \u2014 suggests that he will be loath to betray this group of people he has repeatedly promised, \u201cI will never, ever let you down.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican who speaks regularly with the president as the leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said that he believed what is weighing on Mr. Trump now is \u201cless the N.R.A. than the Trump voter.\u201d\n\nThe dilemma for Mr. Trump is that those are often the same thing.\n\nHe is facing pressure from lawmakers in both parties to go further in restricting weapons than the N.R.A. would like. And he seems to appreciate that he has a unique ability to sway skeptical Republicans given that conservatives largely trust him on the issue in a way they never did with Barack Obama. \u201cThere\u2019s one president since I\u2019ve been involved in any of this that can get this done,\u201d said Senator Joe Manchin III, the West Virginia Democrat who co-wrote the last major gun control bill to come to a vote in the Senate in 2013. \u201cAnd it\u2019s him.\u201d\n\nThe ties between him and the millions of Americans for whom gun ownership is a personal and political consideration are stronger and more natural than many Republicans could have predicted when he first started running for president in 2015.\n\nMr. Trump had supported an assault weapons ban and at one point appeared to wish that there were no guns at all in the United States. He told CNN\u2019s Larry King in a 1999 interview, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I like better than nobody has them, but that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut by the time of his 2016 campaign, a formal working relationship became a matter of political necessity on both ends \u2014 gun activists who were single-mindedly determined to stop four more years of a Democratic president and a candidate who needed the validation and grass-roots muscle that a conservative powerhouse like the N.R.A. could offer.\n\nMr. Trump came to appreciate the potency that gun rights \u2014 and the fear of having them stripped away \u2014 had with many of his supporters. And it became an extension of the cultural battles he eagerly threw himself into.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Gun owners tended to be cut from the same blue-collar cloth that held together Mr. Trump\u2019s core constituency. They gravitated toward his tough talk on defending the Second Amendment in the same way they did on other issues like crime, trade and illegal immigration.\n\n\u201cHe had this connection to people who felt like he cared about them, their well-being, their family, safety and security,\u201d Mr. Bossie added.\n\nIn guns, Mr. Trump found an issue very similar in its emotional pull to immigration. It appealed to voters who believed that Democrats ignored the concerns of people like them and were hostile to their beliefs and culture. It fed a sense that the government was pursuing policies that would ultimately hurt them. And at its most extreme, it fanned the fear that a seemingly unstoppable force was on the verge of snatching away life as they knew it \u2014 their understanding of what it meant to be American.\n\nThese sentiments appealed to Mr. Trump, who has always tended to believe in conspiracies, especially ones hatched to undermine him.\n\nAs simpatico as the relationship appears now, the N.R.A.\u2019s backing of Mr. Trump in May 2016 was not a universally popular move among the membership. First, it was highly unusual. The group typically waited until the general election was well underway before getting involved in a presidential campaign. Second, it irritated many members who felt that the N.R.A. was rushing toward an endorsement before the deep wounds of a bitter Republican primary had healed.\n\nUnlike many social conservatives and evangelical Christians who remained wary of Mr. Trump \u2014 some of them right up until Election Day \u2014 the N.R.A. decided early on that it had too much at stake in the election not to back Hillary Clinton\u2019s opponent, whoever that may be.\n\nEspecially significant for the group was the fact that gun rights were at a tipping point on the Supreme Court after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, the author of the court\u2019s opinion in District of Columbia v. Heller, the landmark case that held that the Second Amendment protected the right to keep a loaded handgun at home for self-defense.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThrough more than $30 million in spending to support Mr. Trump, the N.R.A.\u2019s political arm turned into a virtual \u201csuper PAC\u201d for him, attacking Mrs. Clinton in the same way Mr. Trump did \u2014 as someone who would leave women vulnerable to attackers in their home by taking away their guns and who botched the response to the attacks in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nCurrent and former aides to Mr. Trump say that he loved the adoration that N.R.A. crowds would shower on him. After speaking at the group\u2019s annual meeting in Atlanta last year, one person who was with him described him as \u201clevitating\u201d with joy.\n\n\u201cYou came through for me, and I am going to come through for you,\u201d he told the crowd.\n\nGrover Norquist, the anti-tax activist who is also an N.R.A. board member, said the speech underscored for him that Mr. Trump had a relationship with gun owners unlike that of one he could recall with any other president. Mr. Trump spoke the language, calling the Second Amendment \u201ca sacred right\u201d and reassuring them that \u201cthe eight-year assault on your Second Amendment freedoms has come to a crashing end.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a very bonding moment,\u201d Mr. Norquist said, adding that Mr. Trump, who had a concealed gun permit when he lived in New York, did not have to fake it as so many other Republicans often do.\n\n\u201cThat was the connection people wanted. They didn\u2019t want to hear you\u2019re a hunter.

Kelly, left, the White House chief of staff, had initially issued a strong defense of Rob Porter, the White House staff secretary who resigned after accusations of domestic abuse. Credit Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Nearly a month after Rob Porter, the White House staff secretary, resigned amid accusations of domestic abuse, John F. Kelly, the president\u2019s chief of staff, acknowledged on Friday that he had stumbled in response to initial reports of the allegations.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t cover ourselves in glory,\u201d Mr. Kelly, who had issued a statement in Mr. Porter\u2019s defense, told a group of reporters gathered in his office. He said that Mr. Porter had \u201cpresented himself as the ultimate gentleman\u201d while he worked at the White House.\n\n\u201cI never saw him mad or abusive in any way,\u201d Mr. Kelly said.\n\nThe White House has struggled to clarify who knew what about Mr. Porter and when. Mr. Kelly, who worked closely with Mr. Porter and eventually accepted his resignation, had declined to publicly clear up the matter, even as the case exposed internal frustrations with his sharp-elbowed attempts to end dysfunction in the West Wing.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Kelly offered his version of the events, adding to the White House\u2019s ever-winding timeline on Mr. Porter while leaving many questions unaddressed. This time, Mr. Kelly agreed with a chronology provided by Christopher A. Wray, the director of the F.B.I., who said that information about Mr. Porter had been delivered to the White House security office nearly a year ago.\n\n\u201cWhat Chris Wray said was accurate,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cWe had received some information at the White House security office on Rob Porter in March.\u201d\n\nMr. Kelly also said that Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, had been unaware of an issue with Mr. Porter\u2019s background investigation, even though Mr. Porter had mentioned to Mr. McGahn in January 2017 that he was worried that his former wives had damaging information against him. (That month, his first wife, Colbie Holderness, sent an F.B.I. agent a set of photographs that showed her with a black eye that she said Mr. Porter had given her.)\n\nMr. Kelly did not say what was in the initial cache of information sent by the F.B.I. last March, or what the bureau sent in subsequent bundles in July and November, delivered after the White House had requested follow-up information on the investigation into Mr. Porter.\n\nIn the days after Mr. Porter\u2019s resignation, multiple people familiar with the situation said top officials, including Mr. McGahn, Mr. Kelly and Joe Hagin, the deputy chief of staff, had learned in November that there were problems with Mr. Porter\u2019s background investigation.\n\nBut Mr. Kelly said that he had not personally known about accusations against Mr. Porter until the afternoon of Feb. 6. Over a few hours that day, Mr. Kelly said, he had issued a statement in strong support of Mr. Porter after Mr. Porter\u2019s second former wife, Jennifer Willoughby, accused him of abuse. Mr. Kelly said that Ms. Willoughby had \u201cmade no mention of any type of physical abuse.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Ms. Willoughby said that Mr. Kelly\u2019s comments \u201cadded to my opinions of how poorly the White House has handled the situation for weeks,\u201d and questioned why her account was not enough for Mr. Kelly to fire Mr. Porter.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t feel Rob should resign until he was accused of physical abuse. That is disturbing,\u201d she said in an email, adding: \u201cI had filed a protective order and called the police on several occasions and I detailed being pulled naked from the shower. That Gen. Kelly does not consider that \u2018abuse\u2019 is terrifying to me.\u201d\n\nMr. Porter offered to resign on Feb. 6, but how seriously Mr. Kelly took Mr. Porter\u2019s initial offer remains unclear. Mr. Kelly said he then departed to Capitol Hill for a meeting on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program \u2014 \u201cWhere did that go?\u201d he joked on Friday \u2014 but by the time he returned, Ms. Holderness had come forward with accusations of physical abuse. Mr. Kelly said that he then accepted Mr. Porter\u2019s resignation, emphasizing that that was before he had seen the photos of Ms. Holderness\u2019s black eye. \u201cNo pictures, by the way,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nOn Friday, current and former White House officials disputed the timeline Mr. Kelly gave, and said that Mr. Porter was never outright fired, as Mr. Kelly has privately suggested.\n\nMr. Kelly\u2019s timeline still does not explain why Mr. Porter returned to the White House the next day, or why the White House said the next day that Mr. Porter would remain on staff for a time before leaving. But Mr. Kelly said he would take the blame.\n\n\u201cI should have collected everyone that works here,\u201d Mr. Kelly said when asked about the fuzziness in the hours after the first report of abuse. \u201cAll 1,100 people.\u201d\n\nIn the meeting on Friday, Mr. Kelly sought to allay speculation that he had faced pressure to resign over the scandal surrounding Mr. Porter, and denied reports that he had offered to do so.\n\n\u201cI have absolutely nothing to even consider resigning over,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Kelly declined to discuss questions that have arisen about security clearances since Mr. Porter resigned. Days ago, Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and a senior adviser, was stripped of his top-secret security clearance after months of delays in completing his background check.\n\nMr. Kelly said that he had been the one to bring order to the process over security clearances at the White House when he arrived last summer. He said that about six weeks into the job, he started trying to organize administrative paperwork and saw that background investigations into \u201ca couple of spreadsheets\u2019 worth\u201d of people were still not complete.\n\n\u201cIt came to my notice that the kind of things I was used to\u201d in previous jobs, including at the Defense Department, Mr. Kelly said, were not \u201cup to the standards I\u2019d been used to.\u201d\n\nMaggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["porter", "mr", "rob", "accusations", "white", "staff", "porters", "abuse", "mishandled", "acknowledges", "security", "house", "john", "kelly"], "polarity": 0.022108408023900978, "subjectivity": 0.2611471861471861},

Visitors not fixated on the clothes might also learn about Jacqueline Kennedy\u2019s politically laden choice to have her daughter attend an integrated kindergarten. Tapping on the exhibit\u2019s interactive video displays, one might discover that Mrs. Johnson held West Wing strategy sessions and lobbied members of Congress on behalf of highway beautification. Or, that Mrs. Roosevelt acted as her disabled husband\u2019s eyes, ears and legs while he was in office.\n\nThe exhibit, which runs through Oct. 1, doesn\u2019t broach how first ladies have coped with their husbands\u2019 infidelities (Mrs. Roosevelt, Mrs. Kennedy, Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. Trump among them). Curators also didn\u2019t acknowledge that many, if not most, of these women were reluctant first ladies and felt stifled and suffocated by the role. Indeed, the first first lady, Martha Washington, wrote to her niece, \u201cI think I am more like a state prisoner than anything else.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMore than two centuries later, Michelle Obama told Oprah, \u201cIt\u2019s the little things you miss,\u201d like just walking out the front door without discussing it with anyone.

The Bush Museum\u2019s exhibit tells us that Julia Tyler encouraged publicity and was the first first lady to be photographed. She wore look-at-me feather headdresses and lavish gowns. To receive guests, she sat atop a raised platform with a coterie she called her \u201cmaids of honor.\u201d Likewise, Frances Cleveland, the youngest first lady, and the only one to marry in the White House, seemed to enjoy the attention. She was so popular that a false news report that she was abandoning the bustle hastened the demise of the faux derri\u00e8re.\n\nWhich brings us back to fashion and our fascination with what first ladies choose to wear and not to wear. \u201cFashion is communication,\u201d said Jessica Gavit, 33, a designer and art director, who was at the preview party at the Bush Museusm, wearing glittery block-heeled ankle boots. \u201cIt speaks as much to the interests, thoughts and values of the person as the quotes,\u201d she said, referring to several quotes attributed to first ladies printed on the walls of the exhibit.

Image Steel blast furnace 8 at the corporation ThyssenKrupp in Duisburg, Germany. Credit Friedemann Vogel/European Pressphoto Agency\n\nTo understand why the worry about President Trump\u2019s planned steel and aluminum tariffs goes so deep on Wall Street and in corporate America, don\u2019t think of Thursday\u2019s news as being about a new tariff on steel and aluminum.\n\nRather, think of it as a signal about the willingness of the president to ignore his most sober-minded advisers and put the global economy at risk to achieve his goal of better terms for American trade.\n\nMuch of the rhetoric from business and conservative groups has focused narrowly on the potential cost of the tariffs. \u201cMake no mistake, this is a tax on American families,\u201d the National Retail Federation said. It is a \u201chuge job-killing tax hike on American consumers,\u201d said Senator Mike Lee, a Utah Republican.\n\nIn terms of direction, this assessment is doubtless correct. The new tariffs will tend, over time, to make automobiles and beer cans and lots of other items more expensive. But in terms of magnitude, it is misleading.\n\nAs Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross argued in a CNBC interview on Friday, for most consumer items we\u2019re discussing trivial amounts of \u201ctax\u201d \u2014 an extra fraction of a penny for the can that contains Campbell\u2019s Soup, a few tenths of a percent on the price of a new car.\n\nSteel imports were worth about $30 billion in 2017, and aluminum imports around $17 billion, according to government data. Even in the simplest possible way of thinking of the potential cost of the new tariffs \u2014 just applying the 25 percent tax on steel and 10 percent tax on aluminum the president plans \u2014 we\u2019re talking about only $9 billion. And that\u2019s before accounting for the resulting shift toward domestic production that is the entire point of the policy.\n\nMore complex modeling would be needed to produce a reliable estimate of the cost of the tariffs, but the point is about the order of magnitude. These are not numbers that are enough to cause much damage to a $20 trillion economy, or to justify the $460 billion decline in the value of the stock market that took place between Thursday\u2019s open and Friday midday.\n\nThis market drop makes more sense if you look at the president\u2019s announcement not in terms of what it means for imported steel and aluminum, but rather what it says about the president himself.\n\nThe most consistent economic idea running through President Trump\u2019s decades in public life has been a conviction that the United States is being duped in the global trade arena. He has denounced China, called for ripping apart the North American Free Trade Agreement, and accused generations of American trade negotiators of being incompetent.\n\nYet in the first 13 months of the Trump administration, even as the president kept using bombastic language about trade, any formal action was restrained.\n\nAn incident from April is instructive. After leaks indicating that Mr. Trump planned to withdraw the United States from Nafta, there was an onslaught of phone calls to the White House from C.E.O.\u2019s and international leaders. And pro-trade advisers worked to get the president\u2019s ear.\n\nHe backed off, saying the next day that he would give Nafta renegotiation a try.\n\nWhen the administration has acted on trade \u2014 with tariffs on solar panels and washing machines, most notably \u2014 the moves have been relatively narrow, fitting comfortably with precedent and unlikely to spark global blowback.\n\nLately, there has even been talk that the administration might reverse course and move to rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade deal that the United States pulled out of at the start of the Trump administration.\n\nMore broadly, financial markets spent the first year of the Trump presidency gaining comfort that investors could count on the administration to deliver business-friendly economic policy, regardless of presidential bombast. That came through in such areas as the tax law (which cut the corporate income tax rate substantially) and appointments to key economic posts (like the former private equity executive Jerome Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve).\n\nThen came Thursday.\n\nMr. Trump not only overruled his more pro-trade advisers, but he also did so in an impromptu way, seemingly setting policy before the details had been worked out and without buy-in from across his own administration.\n\nAnd by invoking national security concerns as the rationale for the action, the president was setting a precedent that could give other countries more wiggle room to use security as a reason for imposing tariffs on American goods.\n\nMoreover, on Friday, rather than try to tamp down fears of an all-out trade war, President Trump appeared to relish the idea. In a Twitter message, he said that for a large country like the United States, trade wars are \u201cgood\u201d and \u201ceasy to win.\u201d\n\nFinancial markets tend to extrapolate, looking at small pieces of information today to project what the future will look like. That\u2019s why when a company reports disappointing financial results for a single quarter \u2014 missing an earnings target by a few million dollars, for example \u2014 markets sometime lop billions from the company\u2019s value.\n\nThe United States economy, in the aftermath of the tariff announcement, is the equivalent. The steel and aluminum tariffs are manageable. But if the president is so gung-ho about a trade war, and is now willing to ignore his more cautious advisers, what comes next might not be.\n\nNeil Irwin is a senior economics correspondent for The Upshot.

As a result of Mr. Trump\u2019s action, major parts of the area are no longer a part of the national monument.\n\n\u201cThe Kaiparowits plateau, located within the monument, contains one of the largest coal deposits in the United States,\u201d an Interior Department memo, issued in the spring of 2017, said. About 11.36 billion tons are \u201ctechnologically recoverable,\u201d it projected.\n\nFrom the start of the Interior Department review process, agency officials directed staff to figure out how much coal, oil and natural gas \u2014 as well as grass for cattle grazing and timber \u2014 had been put essentially off limits, or made harder to access, by the decision to designate the areas as national monuments.\n\nPhoto\n\nOne memo, for example, asked Interior staff to prepare a report on each national monument, with a yellow highlighter on the documents emphasizing the need to examine in detail \u201cannual production of coal, oil, gas and renewables (if any) on site; amount of energy transmission infrastructure on site (if any).\u201d It was followed up by a reminder to staff in June to also look at how the decision to create new National Monuments in Utah might have hurt area mines.\n\n\u201cSorry about this, but this came from DOI late yesterday,\u201d Timothy Fisher, the leader of the National Monuments and Conservation Areas program at Interior wrote to his colleagues, referring to the Department of Interior headquarters in Washington. \u201cAre there mines or processing facilities near or adjacent to a National Monument?\u201d he wrote. He also asked how the protection of the federal lands may have affected mining.\n\nIn another email exchange, in May, two Bureau of Land Management officials said that Mr. Zinke\u2019s chief of staff for policy, Downey Magallanes, had phoned to ask for information on a uranium mill in or near the Bears Ears monument. The request sought \u201ceconomic data to the extent available,\u201d as well as grazing and hunting maps.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd on July 17, Ms. Magallanes and Mr. Zinke\u2019s counselor for energy policy, Vincent DeVito, met with representatives of a uranium mining company. The company, Energy Fuels Resources Inc., said its representatives hoped to discuss its White Mesa uranium mill as well as the Daneros uranium mine, both adjacent to the Bears Ears monument.\n\nIn addition to Paul Goranson, a top executive at Energy Fuels Resources, the meeting included Mary Bono, a former Republican congresswoman from California; and Andrew Wheeler, then a lobbyist at the firm Faegre Baker Daniels Consulting and now awaiting confirmation to be deputy administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nMs. Swift, the Interior Department spokeswoman, said that no uranium mine or milling operations were located within the boundaries of either the original or modified Bears Ears National Monument.\n\nThe debate over oil and gas reserves below the ground in Bears Ears started during the Obama administration, the documents show, with officials from Utah State Board of Education writing to the Interior Department objecting to the plan to designate the area as a national monument.\n\nBefore Utah became a state, in 1896, the federal government granted so-called trust lands to support state institutions, like the public schools, given that nearly 70 percent of the land in the state is federally controlled.\n\nThe state has generated more than $1.7 billion in revenue from the trust lands to support public schools, mostly by selling off mineral rights and allowing private companies to extract oil or gas. The Bears Ears National Monument created by President Obama in 2016 included about 110,000 acres of these trust lands, eliminating the potential for resource sales, the state said.\n\nJohn Andrews, associate director of the Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration, which oversees the lands designated for school funding, acknowledged that the new Bears Ears boundaries approved by Mr. Trump, which reduced the land removed from the trust\u2019s management to about 22,000 acres, reflected his group\u2019s request to exclude trust lands from federal protection.\n\nBut he noted that Mr. Trump ultimately reduced the monument by a much larger amount than his organization had sought.\n\n\u201cObviously they were looking at facts other than the ones we had raised, we assume,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Whitlock, the spokesman for Mr. Hatch, said, \u201cSenator Hatch is grateful these emails have been released because they make very clear that his priority in addressing the Bears Ears situation was looking out for the people of Utah.\u201d", "keywords": ["mr", "monument", "interior", "national", "lands", "bears", "utah", "emails", "shrink", "department", "central", "ears", "oil", "decision", "state"], "polarity": 0.08378363197983452, "subjectivity": 0.46774471660547595},

For the November election, Mr. Lamb\u2019s hometown, Mt. Lebanon, will be in the newly drawn 17th District, where votes cast for the two parties have divided much more equally than they have in the current 18th District. Republican leaders are seeking to block the new map in federal court.\n\nIn conversations with voters, the failure of politicians to keep their promises was a common theme, enveloping the White House, Congress and the reason for the special election in the first place.

The White House has not even completed a legal review of the measures.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s off-the-cuff opening of a trade war rattled the stock market, enraged Republicans and left Mr. Cohn\u2019s future in doubt. Mr. Cohn, who almost left last year after Mr. Trump\u2019s response to a white nationalist march in Charlottesville, Va., indicated he was waiting to see whether Mr. Trump goes through with the tariffs, people familiar with his thinking said.\n\nThe chaotic rollout also reflected the departure of another White House official, Rob Porter, who as the staff secretary had a key role in keeping the paper flowing in the West Wing and who had backed Mr. Cohn in his free-trade views. Mr. Porter was forced out last month after facing accusations of spousal abuse.\n\nIt was the second day in a row that Mr. Trump blindsided Republicans and his own aides. On Wednesday, in another televised session at the White House, he embraced the stricter gun control measures backed by Democrats and urged lawmakers to revive gun-safety regulations that are opposed by the National Rifle Association and most of his party. But late Thursday, he appeared to have changed his mind again, this time after a meeting with N.R.A. leaders that he described as \u201cgreat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always said that it was going to take awhile for Donald Trump to adjust as president,\u201d said Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and an old friend of the president\u2019s.

Mr. Trump has few fixed views on any issue, but he has been consistent on his antipathy for free trade since the 1980s, when he took out newspaper ads warning about American deficits with Japan \u2014 a concern that has shifted to China in recent years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe W.T.O. has been a disaster for this country,\u201d Mr. Trump said Thursday, asserting that China\u2019s economic rise coincided with its entry into the World Trade Organization. \u201cIt has been great for China and terrible for the United States, and great for other countries.\u201d\n\nBut a president who has long tried to impose his version of reality on the world is finding the limits of that strategy. Without Mr. Porter playing a stopgap role on trade, the debate has been marked by a lack of focus on policy and planning, according to several aides.\n\nMorale in the West Wing has sunk to a new low, these people said. In private conversations, Mr. Trump lashes out regularly at Attorney General Jeff Sessions with a vitriol that stuns members of his staff. Some longtime advisers said that Mr. Trump regards Mr. Sessions\u2019s decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation as the \u201coriginal sin,\u201d which the president thinks has left him exposed.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s children, meanwhile, have grown exasperated with Mr. Kelly, seeing him as a hurdle to their father\u2019s success and as antagonistic to their continued presence, according to several people familiar with their thinking. Anthony Scaramucci, an ally of some in the Trump family, whom Mr. Kelly fired as communications director after only 11 days, intensified his criticism of the chief of staff in a series of news interviews on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nYet Mr. Trump is also frustrated with Mr. Kushner, whom he now views as a liability because of his legal entanglements, the investigations of the Kushner family\u2019s real estate company and the publicity over having his security clearance downgraded, according to two people familiar with his views. In private conversations, the president vacillates between sounding regretful that Mr. Kushner is taking arrows and annoyed that he is another problem to deal with.\n\nPrivately, some aides have expressed frustration that Mr. Kushner and his wife, the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, have remained at the White House, despite Mr. Trump at times saying they never should have come to the White House and should leave. Yet aides also noted that Mr. Trump has told the couple that they should keep serving in their roles, even as he has privately asked Mr. Kelly for his help in moving them out.\n\nTo some staff members, the chaos feels reminiscent of the earliest days of the Trump administration.

Image President Trump and Senator Dianne Feinstein on Wednesday at the White House. Credit Tom Brenner/The New York Times\n\nPresident Trump discussed potential solutions to curb gun violence on Wednesday during a televised meeting with a bipartisan group of lawmakers.\n\nThe president strayed from the facts during his remarks, as The New York Times reported previously. Here is a look at the claims made during the session by other lawmakers \u2014 Republicans and Democrats \u2014 that may have strayed from the facts or otherwise require some additional context.\n\n\u201cThis is when the 10-year assault weapon ban was in \u2014 how incidents and deaths dropped. When it ended, you see it going up.\u201d \u2014 Senator Dianne Feinstein.\n\nThis needs context.\n\nIn the past, Ms. Feinstein has referenced an analysis by Louis Klarevas, a lecturer at the University of Massachusetts Boston, that found the assault weapons ban drastically reduced gun massacres.\n\nBut it\u2019s difficult to directly link declines in crime or gun violence to any specific law, given the limited scope and loopholes in each one, according to most experts and research.\n\nAs The Times has previously reported:\n\nThe 1994 ban on assault weapons has become a particular and recent subject of intense debate. The N.R.A. has cited a 2004 analysis funded by the Justice Department to argue that the \u201cban could not be credited with any reduction in crime.\u201d On the other hand, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, has claimed in a Twitter post that \u201cthe number of gun massacres fell by 37%\u201d while the ban was in place. Christopher Koper, a professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., and the lead author of the study that is cited by the N.R.A., has repeatedly said that the ban had mixed effects and final results would not be immediately evident. \u201cMy work is often cited in misleading ways that don\u2019t give the full picture,\u201d Mr. Koper said Thursday in an email. \u201cThese laws can modestly reduce shootings overall\u201d and reduce the number and severity of mass shootings.\n\n\u201cThese shooters typically are males. They\u2019re white and they\u2019re suicidal.\u201d \u2014 Senator Steve Daines, Republican of Montana\n\nTrue.\n\nA database maintained by Mother Jones, a progressive magazine, shows that 95 out of 97 mass shootings from 1982 to 2018 involved male gunmen. Fifty-five were committed by white men.\n\n\u201cThe states that have these background checks, they have a 38 percent lower domestic homicide rate \u2014 this is domestic violence.\u201d \u2014 Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota\n\nCausation is not clear.\n\nMs. Klobuchar is probably referring to a report from Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control advocacy group, that claims \u201c38 percent fewer women\u201d are \u201cshot to death by intimate partners\u201d in states that require background checks for all handgun sales.\n\nThis analysis, however, does not account for other factors that contribute to domestic violence, leading other researchers to question the sweeping conclusion about background checks.\n\nApril Zeoli, a professor at Michigan State University who studies intimate partner violence, called the Everytown estimate a \u201cback of the napkin\u201d calculation.\n\nMs. Zeoli\u2019s research has found that state laws restricting access to firearms for people who have been convicted of domestic violence result in declines in intimate partner homicides; specifically, 11 percent from laws that mandate buyers to get a permit whether they\u2019re purchasing from licensed or private dealers, she said. (Other research also shows this.)\n\nUnlike Everytown, Ms. Zeoli also looked at state domestic violence laws, poverty and divorce rates, average amounts of public assistance, educational attainment gaps between men and women, homicides not related to domestic violence, percentage of suicides by firearms as a proxy for gun ownership rates and law enforcement availability.\n\n\u201cThose are areas where there are no guns. The reason I carry a concealed firearm everywhere I go is because I don\u2019t know where those gun-free zones are, that I may walking through at the mall, or at the doughnut shop, or wherever I might be.\u201d \u2014 Representative John Rutherford, Republican of Florida\n\nThis needs context.\n\nAs Mr. Rutherford and Mr. Trump discussed concealed-carry laws, Mr. Trump said, \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed concealed in a gun-free zone.\u201d The exchange highlights how amorphous the term \u201cgun-free zone\u201d has become.\n\nFederal law prohibits firearms in grade schools, but makes explicit exceptions for security personnel and instructional purposes (hunting classes, for example). So, Mr. Rutherford is wrong to state that there are never guns in \u201cgun-free zones.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, at least eight states allow concealed carry for teachers at grade schools, and two others have eased restrictions, according to the Giffords Law Center, a gun control advocacy group.\n\nPrivate businesses may also ban civilian use of firearms on their premises, but state laws vary on how and on the extent to which a business can opt out.\n\nTexas has very specific requirements for the signs businesses put up to indicate that they do not allow firearms on their properties. (For example, they must be in both English and Spanish.) North Carolina requires signs to be \u201cconspicuous,\u201d while Florida has no explicit rules. Florida is one of 23 states that require business owners to allow guns in cars parked on company property.\n\n\u201cPeople just want to dismiss concealed-carry permits. They do actually increase safety.\u201d \u2014 Representative Steve Scalise, Republican of Louisiana\n\nThis is disputed.\n\nWhen asked what data Mr. Scalise was referring to, a spokesman told The Times, \u201cSince the early \u201990s, the significant increase in the issuance of concealed-carry permits by states has been accompanied by a significant drop in violent crime rates \u2014 and that includes millions of new permits being issued in the last decade or so.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman cited the work of John R. Lott Jr., an economist and gun rights advocate whose book \u201cMore Guns, Less Crime\u201d makes the case that \u201cpassing concealed-handgun laws deters violent crime.\u201d But Mr. Lott\u2019s findings have been questioned by other academics.\n\nIn 2005, a panel at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine concluded that \u201cno link between right-to-carry laws and changes in crime is apparent in the raw data, even in the initial sample.\u201d\n\nOther researchers have reached an opposite conclusion. In a 2017 study, John Donohue, a professor at Stanford Law School, found that states that adopted right-to-carry laws saw an increase in violent crime.\n\nLinda Qiu is a fact-check reporter, based in Washington.

Known primarily for its role in search-and-rescue missions, the Coast Guard has in recent years taken on missions around the world that include guarding the president and even cybersecurity.\n\nBut for years, the Coast Guard has suffered even as its mission has expanded, in part because of its image as a service that towed ships or searched for people lost at sea. Another issue has been a lack of funding. The Coast Guard does not receive any additional money from Congress for its work in areas such as disaster relief.\n\nThe Trump administration, in addition to moving to increase the Coast Guard\u2019s budget, has lavished praise on the service.\n\nDuring a celebration of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s 15th anniversary on Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence singled out the Coast Guard. \u201cThe men and women of the Coast Guard have inspired the nation,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the administration\u2019s relationship with the Coast Guard has also been frayed.\n\nThe initial Trump White House spending plan would have cut the Coast Guard\u2019s funding by 14 percent, or about $1.3 billion, to help pay for Mr. Trump\u2019s border wall. The other military services \u2014 the Army, the Air Force, the Navy and the Marine Corps \u2014 all saw funding increases.\n\nThe administration reversed itself and increased the Coast Guard\u2019s budget request to, among other things, build a new Arctic icebreaker for the first time in 40 years as the United States competes with Russia and China in the polar region.\n\nThe vessel will not be ready until 2023, however, and will be one of only two such ships that the United States is operating.

Mr. McCabe also declined to comment. He and his allies have steadfastly maintained that he did nothing improper and cooperated fully with the inspector general.\n\nIn October 2016, The Wall Street Journal revealed a dispute between F.B.I. and Justice Department officials over how to proceed in an investigation into the financial dealings of the Clinton family\u2019s foundation. The article revealed a closed-door meeting during which senior Justice Department officials were dismissive of the evidence and declined to authorize subpoenas or grand jury activity. Some F.B.I. agents, the article said, believed that Mr. McCabe had put the brakes on the investigation.\n\nOthers rejected that notion. The Journal, citing sources including \u201cone person close to Mr. McCabe,\u201d revealed a tense conversation with a senior Justice Department official in which Mr. McCabe insisted that the F.B.I. had the authority to press ahead with the investigation into the Clinton Foundation.\n\nThe inspector general has concluded that Mr. McCabe authorized F.B.I. officials to provide information for that article, according to the four people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the report before it is published. The public affairs office had arranged a phone call to discuss the case, the people said.

Rather than let incomplete or inaccurate coverage circulate, officials often try to fill out the picture or provide a defense. But Justice Department rules prohibit the dissemination of confidential information, and the inspector general\u2019s report is expected to criticize Mr. McCabe for disclosing the existence of a continuing investigation to The Journal.\n\nWhen an inquiry uncovers evidence that an agent has violated Justice Department regulations, the inspector general typically refers the matter to the F.B.I.\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility, which handles questions of punishment.\n\nIt is unclear whether the inspector general will identify others who spoke about the Clinton investigation. But Mr. McCabe is by far the most prominent subject. Mr. Trump has taunted him on Twitter, writing in December that he \u201cis racing the clock to retire with full benefits. 90 days to go?!!!\u201d Mr. McCabe is eligible to retire March 18.\n\nMr. Trump has animosity toward Mr. McCabe for several reasons, including his close ties to the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey, whom Mr. Trump fired last year. But the president is particularly bothered by the fact that Mr. McCabe\u2019s wife, Jill, ran as a Democrat in a failed campaign for a State Senate seat in Virginia. Her campaign received hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from a political committee run by Terry McAuliffe, the Virginia governor at the time and a longtime ally of the Clintons.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLater, after Mrs. McCabe lost the race, Mr. McCabe was promoted to deputy director and oversaw the Clinton investigation. Though Mr. McCabe sought ethics and legal advice about whether to recuse himself, some in the F.B.I. considered his involvement a conflict of interest. Ultimately, amid scrutiny from the news media, Mr. Comey pressured Mr. McCabe to recuse himself. The inspector general is examining whether Mr. McCabe should have done so earlier.\n\nMr. Trump has seized on that issue in repeatedly criticizing Mr. McCabe, a lifelong Republican who did not vote in the 2016 election. In face-to-face meetings with Mr. McCabe, the president questioned how he had voted and needled him about his wife. In one instance, he called Mrs. McCabe \u201ca loser,\u201d according to people familiar with the conversation, which was first reported by NBC News.\n\nMr. McCabe\u2019s allies at the F.B.I. say that Mr. Trump is also eager to discredit Mr. McCabe because he can corroborate Mr. Comey\u2019s accounts of meetings with Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. McCabe rose quickly through the F.B.I. ranks and was seen as a new model for the second-in-command when he was promoted in 2016. The F.B.I. had transformed from a law-and-order agency to an integral part of the nation\u2019s intelligence apparatus, and Mr. McCabe, who graduated from Duke and Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, was picked not based on a career of street work but based on his intellect and decision-making.\n\nThat won him equal parts praise and disdain inside the F.B.I., with longtime agents accusing him of having ascended too quickly.\n\nMr. McCabe is on leave while he awaits retirement.

Image Buckets of steel pipes waiting to be loaded onto a cargo ship in China. American steel producers have long complained about unfair practices. Credit China Network/Reuters\n\nPresident Trump announced today that his administration would impose a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and a 10 percent tariff on imported aluminum, on the grounds that other countries\u2019 trade practices endanger American national security by undermining domestic production. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nWhat is a tariff?\n\nIt is simply a tax placed on some particular class of imported goods. If the Trump administration follows through on the president\u2019s comments Thursday, a company bringing $100,000 of steel made in Canada into the United States would have to pay $25,000 to the government, effectively increasing its price. Tariffs are typically a governmental tool to protect domestic industries and raise revenue.\n\nWait, why did you say \u2018if\u2019 the administration follows through?\n\nThe president made the announcement at an event that was pulled together hastily, and while his preferences were broadly known, some congressional Republicans and business lobbyists were still taken by surprise. By Thursday afternoon, many allies of the president were imploring him to change his mind (the new tariffs are set to go into effect next week).\n\nAlthough President Trump\u2019s criticisms of trading practices by China and other countries have been a hallmark of his years in public life, it appears the details of this policy have not been fully worked through. The White House offered no real implementation details.\n\nWhat is the rationale?\n\nAmerican steel and aluminum companies have long complained of unfair practices by overseas competitors, especially Chinese state subsidies that encourage production. This can flood the global marketplace with metals, depress prices and make American production less economical than it otherwise would be.\n\nAmerican trade officials have sought redress in various ways, including a decision by the George W. Bush administration in 2002 to impose steel tariffs of up to 30 percent. But that was a more narrowly targeted law aimed at safeguarding domestic industries harmed by imports (the Trump administration has used that provision to impose tariffs on imported solar panels and washing machines).\n\nThe Trump administration is on more uncharted ground by basing the tariffs on national security concerns \u2014 Section 232 of a law enacted in the Cold War. The argument is that with domestic metals production undermined, the United States is left vulnerable in the event of conflict that disrupts trade flows.\n\nExpect furious lobbying in the days ahead to try to persuade the president to exclude military allies\u2019 metals from the tariffs. Defense Secretary James Mattis has warned that tariffs should be targeted so as not to damage relationships with allies, but it appears the president did not heed that advice.\n\nWho wins and who loses?\n\nThe big winners are the United States steel and aluminum industries, which have lobbied for years for this kind of aggressive government action.\n\nThe most immediate losers are the industries that rely on steel and aluminum as an input and will face higher prices. That includes some of the nation\u2019s biggest industries: the automobile sector; aerospace; heavy equipment; and construction. In short, the chassis of a Ford, the body of a Caterpillar bulldozer, the wings of a Boeing aircraft, and the steel girders inside a New York skyscraper are all about to get more expensive.\n\nAfter the president\u2019s announcement, Wall Street quickly reflected this divide: Shares of U.S. Steel and Century Aluminum were each up about 7 percent shortly afterward, while shares of Ford, Caterpillar and Boeing were each down about 3 percent.\n\nThe industries that use steel and aluminum are considerably larger as a share of the United States economy than are steel and aluminum producers. By one estimate, from Lydia Cox of Harvard and Kadee Russ of the University of California, Davis, steel-using industries employ 80 times as many people as steel-producing industries.\n\nBut what does this mean for consumers?\n\nThe simple answer is that goods containing metals will become more expensive. But there\u2019s not much reason to expect enormous price increases for most goods.\n\nFirst, the United States imports only about one-third of its steel, and the tariff would not apply to domestic production (aluminum is more heavily dependent on imports, with only 10 percent made domestically).\n\nSo prices will go up by only a fraction of the tariff amount. But consumers don\u2019t generally buy raw steel and aluminum. People buy consumer goods in which those raw materials are but one input. A car includes not just steel and aluminum but also plastics and textiles and glass, not to mention the computer circuitry that controls it all, the design know-how and assemblage work, along with a profit margin for both the automaker and the dealer.\n\nFor any given product, it is hard to predict whether producers will eat the cost of more expensive metals, pass the cost on in the form of higher prices, or both. Put differently: If your favorite beer producers are looking at paying an extra fraction of a cent for each aluminum can, they might just take on the cost themselves, they might raise prices, or they might split the difference. It is hard to know in advance how much of each will take place.\n\nSo does this matter for the economy?\n\nThe American economy is relatively strong at the moment, and has been historically resilient to most disruptions. Companies are good at restructuring their supply chains to minimize disruption because of tariffs like these. In most retrospective analyses, the 2002 Bush administration steel tariffs have been judged to be costly relative to the jobs that were saved, but they were hardly the cause of some economic disaster.\n\nThis action may create some jobs in domestic metals-producing industries, cost some jobs in fields where steel and aluminum are inputs, and push consumer prices a bit higher. The large and dynamic United States economy can handle it.\n\nThe risk comes from the potential ripple effects.\n\nAffected countries may well retaliate by ordering tariffs on American goods, and they could carefully target goods to cause economic or political pain. American exporters \u2014 whether they sell passenger airplanes or soybeans \u2014 should be nervous about the next shoe to fall. There are few winners in an all-out trade war like one that enveloped the world economy in the 1930s.\n\nIn particular, the Trump administration\u2019s invocation of national security concerns could set a precedent in which China and other nations are willing to use national security as grounds for tariffs, hurting the ability of the World Trade Organization to arbitrate disputes.\n\nThe real risk isn\u2019t that steel and aluminum are a bit more expensive, though that is likely to be the case. It\u2019s that an entire system of global trade, which the United States helped build, might be undermined.\n\nNeil Irwin is a senior economics correspondent for The Upshot.

Trump Jr. about a 2016 meeting with Russian officials has drawn attention from federal investigators. On Tuesday, she testified for eight hours before the House Intelligence Committee and made headlines for admitting that she had sometimes told fibs as part of her job.\n\nLast month, the man she had been dating, the former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, was accused by his former wives of domestic abuse, sparking an ongoing scandal that offered a glimpse of her closely guarded personal life and drew paparazzi to her apartment building. There were rumblings that Mr. Trump questioned Ms. Hicks\u2019s judgment after the White House initially defended Mr. Porter, although a bevy of administration officials, including the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, later vouched for Ms. Hicks in on-the-record interviews.\n\nMs. Hicks had stopped monitoring news coverage of herself, restricting her television intake to Fox News, which she often watched on mute, assuming that the Trump-friendly network would rarely include her name on its chyrons.\n\nFriends who reached out to her, offering support or guidance, acknowledged that Ms. Hicks had been distressed. But they also received text messages from her in which she declared that she was tougher than people assumed.\n\nMs. Hicks\u2019s career followed a curious trajectory. As a young model, she appeared on the covers of young adult paperbacks and in Ralph Lauren catalogs before going to work for Ms. Trump\u2019s apparel and licensing brand. Even after she had begun serving as an Oval Office gatekeeper, she maintained a low public profile, which fueled the fascination \u2014 and sometimes disdain \u2014 of those who watch national politics closely.\n\nVideo\n\nEmily Nussbaum, The New Yorker\u2019s television critic, often tweeted whimsically about Ms. Hicks, calling her an \u201cIt Girl.\u201d (Ms. Hicks was once the face of a \u201cGossip Girl\u201d-spinoff book series called \u201cIt Girl.\u201d) Others dismissed her as a mere factotum, especially after a report that she was once tasked during the campaign with steaming Mr. Trump\u2019s suits, sometimes while he was wearing them. On Wednesday, after news of Ms. Hicks\u2019s exit was announced, the New Yorker writer Jia Tolentino tweeted: \u201cGoodbye to Hope Hicks, an object lesson in the quickest way a woman can advance under misogyny: silence, beauty, and unconditional deference to men.\u201d\n\nIn Washington, however, Ms. Hicks\u2019s success was viewed as a product of other qualities, including her nuanced understanding of Mr. Trump\u2019s moods, her ability to subtly nudge him away from his coarser impulses and her skill as a liaison for some of the most prominent journalists in the country.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhen she tells you something, you know she is speaking to the president, because she is with him all the time,\u201d said Steve Scully, the senior executive producer at C-Span and coordinator of the network\u2019s White House coverage. \u201cIt was amazing how often he would turn to Hope and ask her questions and ask her point of view.

Often, she could single-handedly arrange time with the easily distracted president. At a Paley Center panel discussion on Wednesday, the NBC News anchor Lester Holt described Ms. Hicks as his first contact for coordinating his interview with Mr. Trump last May. \u201cShe was quite helpful,\u201d Mr. Holt said.\n\nAnd in an administration riven by infighting, Ms. Hicks\u2019s privileged position with the president meant that, for journalists, she was among the few officials whose information was deemed reliable, or at least not often compromised by personal squabbles.\n\nOf course, she always advocated for her boss, lamenting that reporters did not see the empathetic and charming Mr. Trump whom she said she knew.\n\nMs. Hicks, a reluctant \u00e9migr\u00e9 to insular Washington, kept a tiny circle of confidants, complaining that she could not trust anyone in a company town. She frequently visited family in Connecticut and friends in New York, where she felt she could comfortably walk down the street without being accosted or asked for a favor.\n\nShe has told friends that, for now, she has no definite ideas for her life after the West Wing, except that she will not be living in Washington. An extended vacation with her family is planned. Book agents have come calling, but Ms. Hicks has told acquaintances that she is reluctant to write anything \u2014 although she has joked that a massive advance could change her mind.\n\n\u201cI think she would benefit from taking a minute or two to get some perspective on all of this,\u201d said Michael Feldman, a Clinton White House veteran who is a family friend of Ms. Hicks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t worry about Hope,\u201d Mr. Feldman added, echoing other friends interviewed for this article. \u201cI fully expect her to land on her feet.\u201d\n\nThose confident in Ms. Hicks\u2019s future prospects sounded more concerned about Mr. Trump and his ability to work without an aide he has relied on nearly every day for three years.\n\n\u201cThis is not losing a staffer,\u201d Mr. Feldman said. \u201cThis is like losing a limb.\u201d", "keywords": ["mr", "limb", "white", "washington", "losing", "ms", "hope", "departure", "hicks", "trump", "trumps", "house", "hickss", "york"], "polarity": 0.073113106511544, "subjectivity": 0.3874954906204906},

The president insisted that he personally would charge into a school, even unarmed, to challenge a gunman. Frank Brogan, a former Florida lieutenant governor who has been nominated for assistant secretary of elementary and secondary education, carries an unusual credential: When he was an assistant principal, Mr. Brogan chased down an armed teenager, talked him into lowering his weapon, then grabbed his arm and wrestled it away.\n\nBut even many educators who have faced off with a school gunman oppose the president\u2019s idea.\n\nEvery day for five and a half years, Jesse Wasmer said, he has thought about the moment that he tackled a student who had just fired a shotgun into the back of a classmate in the cafeteria of a suburban Baltimore high school.\n\n\u201cNever have I thought, \u2018I wish I\u2019d had a gun,\u2019\u201d Mr. Wasmer said.\n\nMr. Wasmer, who was a guidance counselor at Perry Hall High School when a student opened fire there in 2012, called the president\u2019s assertions \u201csimplistic and misguided.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think as educators we\u2019re trained to nurture kids and foster kids, and our first instinct is to not shoot or harm them,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we need is more caring adults in these kids\u2019 lives, not more guns.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nOfficials here in this town of 20,000 do not swagger.\n\n\u201cI agree with those folks who say teachers should teach and cops should be cops, but we got a mess on our hands,\u201d said Sheriff John Lenhart of Shelby County, who gave up his National Rifle Association membership in the 1990s. \u201cIf I have to wait on state officials, on the federal government, on psychologists to figure out why people hurt one another, we would have nothing in our school system.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSince 2013, in response to the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., legislation in state capitals across the country has sought to arm school staff. At least 10 states allow staff members to possess or have access to a firearm on school grounds, according to an analysis by the Education Commission of the States. And local districts have varied their approach to arming educators \u2014 in Ohio, guns are kept in safes; in Texas, they can be worn in holsters or kept in safes within immediate reach.\n\nA Florida state legislative committee approved a $67 million \u201cschool marshal\u201d program this week to train and arm teachers \u2014 over the vocal opposition of Parkland residents.\n\nIn Texas, some public school systems have been quietly arming teachers and administrators for more than a decade. Teachers and other school personnel who volunteer to undergo specialized training receive approval to either carry a concealed firearm in school or have one within reach.\n\nPhoto\n\nLawmakers, educators and advocates for gun rights said Texas\u2019 school marshal and school guardian programs have eased fears of armed intruders and have not led to any firearm accidents or mishaps. The state\u2019s programs could serve as a model for schools around the country, advocates say.\n\nOne rural district, Harrold Independent School District, has been allowing armed personnel to carry concealed firearms on school grounds as part of its guardian program since 2007, one year after a shooting at an Amish school in Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cThis clearly is the solution to the problem that we\u2019re seeing around the country, and I think the president has recognized that,\u201d said State Representative Jason Villalba, a Dallas Republican who wrote the law that established the school-marshal program.\n\nAt a meeting at the White House with other governors on Monday, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, told Mr. Trump that in more than 100 school districts in Texas, teachers and other personnel carry a weapon and are trained to respond to an attack.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cCandidly, some school districts, they promote it,\u201d the governor told the president. \u201cBecause they will have signs out front \u2014 a warning sign: \u2018Be aware, there are armed personnel on campus\u2019 \u2014 warning anybody coming on there that they \u2014 if they attempt to cause any harm, they\u2019re going to be in trouble.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Ohio, which allows local school boards to decide who can possess or have access to firearms on school grounds, Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, also supports arming teachers.\n\nOhio\u2019s teachers\u2019 unions have mobilized against the widespread arming of teachers in schools, arguing that gun control, not armed clashes, will protect students.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate that there are teachers that are willing to take this extra step. It comes from a good place,\u201d said Melissa Cropper, the president of the Ohio Federation of Teachers. \u201cBut when you start thinking about all that could go wrong in that situation, there are too many risks involved.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nLike many districts, Sidney City Schools was shaken by the slaughter of 20 first graders and six staff members at Sandy Hook in 2012. In the following days, Sheriff Lenhart presented Mr. Scheu with an equation: Every 17 seconds after the first shots are fired and the first 911 call is made, somebody gets hurt or dies.\n\n\u201cEven in the best-case scenario, we could get here in four to five minutes,\u201d Sheriff Lenhart said. \u201cYou do the math.\u201d\n\nWithin a year, Sheriff Lenhart had led what he calls a \u201clayered\u201d approach to school security and a \u201cconservative\u201d approach to arming teachers in the 3,400-student school district.\n\nThe district spent about $70,000 on safes, bulletproof vests, cameras, guns, radios and ammunition. Uniformed, armed officers cost $200,000 a year, and an insurance policy of $100,000 a year includes coverage for its staff with access to firearms. Those are negligible costs for a school district with a $36 million budget, the superintendent said.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re buying time, and it\u2019s of the essence,\u201d Mr. Scheu said.\n\nWindows and doors are numbered in the district\u2019s schools, and visitors have to be buzzed in. Each school has a panic button and security camera system that feeds to the sheriff\u2019s office. Every school has a uniformed, armed guard, mostly retired sheriff\u2019s deputies, every day from bell to bell. The high school has a specially trained officer and a bulletproof window between the secretary and visitors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd if all else fails, there\u2019s a secret group of 40 educators \u2014 teachers, principals, custodians, secretaries \u2014 called a \u201cfirst responder team\u201d that can retrieve firearms in under a minute.\n\nThe team was vetted by Mr. Scheu and Sheriff Lenhart, and completed a 16-hour training course that includes firearm safety, unarmed defensive tactics and basic gunshot first aid. Its members are required to attend a concealed weapons course, as well as additional monthly trainings at either the firing range where they practice marksmanship and in school-based simulations where they practice in the hallways, identifying threats and eliminating them with air guns.\n\nSince the team was created, it has responded to one incident, this past August when a student brought a gun to school in his backpack. It did not require a member to retrieve a gun.\n\nThe measures here met some opposition at first, from the town\u2019s teachers union and police chief, who were concerned about gun safety.\n\nBut Rick Cron, the armed guard at Sidney Middle School, said he would put members of his team up against any law enforcement officer in Ohio. The state requires that officers fire 25 bullets a year; his team members shoot at least 600.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the teacher\u2019s responsibility to protect the kids, no matter what, and they do it already,\u201d Mr. Cron said, \u201cbut without the tools.\u201d\n\nNicki New, the parent of three students in Sidney City Schools, said she felt safer dropping off her children knowing there were staff members equipped to respond to a parent\u2019s worst nightmare.\n\n\u201cGod forbid, if something would happen, knowing that not only a law enforcement officer is there, but there are teachers in that building who can give my child a fighting chance, is even more reassuring,\u201d Ms. New said.", "keywords": ["mr", "armed", "members", "texas", "teachers", "wants", "arm", "trump", "team", "state", "educators", "schools", "school"], "polarity": 0.07691177649510983, "subjectivity": 0.37541506333172986},

Governor Inslee, who has spent the past decade of his political career focusing on climate change, earning the sobriquet \u201cgreenest governor in America,\u201d sees the issue as a way to directly attack Mr. Trump, who has mocked established climate science, rolled back environmental regulations and promised to withdraw the United States from the landmark Paris climate accord.\n\nThis past Sunday, Governor Inslee said, he made his views clear at a governors\u2019 breakfast with Scott Pruitt, the head of Mr. Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency and the president\u2019s point man in undoing climate change rules. \u201cI told him, you\u2019re killing my state,\u201d Governor Inslee said of his conversation with Mr. Pruitt. \u201cMy state is going up in smoke because our forests are involved in these catastrophic fires.\u201d He added, \u201cI told him, this administration is not just irresponsible but morally reprehensible.\u201d\n\nAn E.P.A. official didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment from Mr. Pruitt.\n\nThe global interest in Governor Inslee\u2019s carbon tax push comes as several state leaders are signaling to the world that they intend to act on climate change with or without the Trump administration. More significantly, the state has drawn attention as a major global economy that is willing to buck conventional wisdom by taking on a carbon tax at all.\n\n\u201cThis is very significant. Washington is not just any state, it\u2019s home to so many global companies: Starbucks, Microsoft, Amazon,\u201d said Erik Solheim, the head of the United Nations Environment Program, speaking by phone from New Delhi, India. \u201cIt is part of the signal to the world that the major states, big business are in disagreement with the U.S. withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, and they are doing something about it.\u201d\n\nOpponents of climate change policy, including the fossil fuel industry and allies of the Trump administration, also see the potential for a Washington carbon tax as seminal. \u201cIf it works in the state of Washington, it\u2019s going to be tried in 10 states next year and 35 states the year after that,\u201d said Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist and political strategist who advised Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and transition. \u201cIf Inslee\u2019s successful, it will be a game-changer. Everyone will take it and copy it and be off and running.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlready, carbon tax bills have been introduced in the legislatures of Utah, Maryland, New York, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Vermont, Maine and Washington, D.C.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. McKenna said that he expects an effort to revive the carbon tax in a November ballot initiative vote to ignite a major campaign both for and against the effort.\n\nMr. McKenna is one of many analysts and strategists who see Governor Inslee\u2019s push to pass a carbon tax in his home state as his first step toward a national campaign. \u201cThis is not just about the state of Washington. This is about Jay positioning himself is a national leader on climate change,\u201d Mr. McKenna said. \u201cHe is testing out themes and strategies.\u201d\n\nEven if Governor Inslee\u2019s tax push makes him a hero in the eyes of environmental advocates around the world, Republicans see it as a political liability, and are preparing to attack him on it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of having votes on carbon taxes,\u201d said Thomas J. Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research, a think tank that supports fossil fuels and supplied the Trump administration with its energy policy blueprint, including rolling back climate change regulations and expanding coal and oil exploration. He recounted the history of politicians losing their jobs as a result of backing a price on carbon pollution.\n\nThere was Al Gore in 1993 when, as vice president, he urged Congress to pass an energy bill that would have taxed the heat content of burning fossil fuels. After Democrats pushed the bill through the House, Republicans attacked them for backing an energy tax, and the vote was seen as a key reason that Democrats lost control of the House in 1996.\n\nThe pattern was repeated in 2009, when President Barack Obama tried to push Congress to pass a so-called cap-and-trade bill, which would have required carbon polluters to pay for permits to pollute. The bill passed in the House but cost coal-state Democrats their seats.\n\nCarbon taxes have helped fell politicians around the world. In 2012, Prime Minister Julia Gillard of Australia successfully pushed to pass a carbon tax. The following year, she was ousted from office in a campaign that was partly seen as a referendum on the tax.\n\nAlthough Hillary Clinton campaigned in 2016 on a pledge to tackle climate change, she stopped short of endorsing a carbon tax. \u201cEven Obama recognized, even Hillary Clinton recognized, that a carbon tax is politically toxic,\u201d Mr. Pyle said. Governor Inslee, he said, is \u201cgoing to find out real quickly that it doesn\u2019t play in Peoria.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven some people who have voted for Governor Inslee express concern about how a carbon tax might be used against him in the hardball of a national political campaign. \u201cI would like to see him run,\u201d said Dan Rystrom, 56, a retired investor from a suburb of Seattle who identified himself as a Democrat. \u201cBut I think it would be the end of him,\u201d he said, describing the political ads he expected to see across the country, saying: \u201cWho is this man from the West Coast who just raised the prices of gasoline?\u201d\n\nStill, there are signs that other politicians might be willing to take the carbon tax plunge. In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is pushing to implement a national carbon tax by the end of the year. And while Washington would be the first state in the nation with a straight carbon tax, it is not the first to force polluters to pay for emitting carbon dioxide: As governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a cap-and-trade law in 2006.\n\nMany environmental economists say that in order for a carbon tax to significantly cut planet-warming pollution, it should be set at a rate of $30 to $50 per ton of pollution. The proposed Washington state tax is $12 a ton, although it would increase at $2 per year until it reaches $30.\n\nThe tax is also likely to have a smaller impact on Washington\u2019s economy than it might in other states, because of its unique energy mix. The state gets most of its electricity from carbon-free hydropower, rather than coal.\n\nIn the interview, Governor Inslee said that whoever ultimately runs against Mr. Trump in 2020 on the Democrat side should put climate change front and center in his or her campaign. The politics of global warming are changing, he said, as more Americans experiencing economically damaging weather events that scientists can attribute to the changing climate.\n\n\u201cClimate change used to be an abstraction. It used to be a graph,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we\u2019re seeing biblical events play out on the 6 o\u2019clock evening news.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe it is a successful and winning issue,\u201d Governor Inslee said.", "keywords": ["mr", "pursues", "win", "washington", "political", "climate", "governor", "change", "inslee", "tax", "energy", "carbon", "gamble", "state"], "polarity": 0.1556083797155226, "subjectivity": 0.4212456194599052},

Democrats have repeatedly accused Mr. Nunes of using his position to protect Mr. Trump from the investigation.\n\nThe House committee spent much of the last month locked in a bitter dispute over the secret Republican memorandum, which accused top F.B.I. and Justice Department officials of abusing their powers to spy on one of Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign advisers. Republicans released the document over the objections of the Justice Department and the F.B.I., which warned in a rare public statement that it was dangerously misleading.\n\nDemocrats called the document reckless and said it was merely a political tool to tarnish the agencies investigating Mr. Trump\u2019s potential ties to Russia. They eventually released their own memo, drawn from the same underlying material, rebutting it.\n\nThe Senate committee has conducted its investigation primarily in private, and Mr. Burr and Mr. Warner remained in lock step both publicly and privately. When Fox News published Mr. Warner\u2019s texts, for example, an aide to Mr. Burr told the network that he had been aware of Mr. Warner\u2019s contacts with Mr. Waldman, and the two senators issued a joint statement condemning the leak.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida and another member of the Intelligence Committee, also defended Mr. Warner.\n\nAnd while Mr. Nunes\u2019s memo consumed Republicans in the House, as well as officials in the White House, Mr. Burr largely steered clear of it. He told CNN it ought not to have been released, and in private he discounted it.\n\nIn the hearing with the intelligence chiefs last month, he sought to draw a distinction between his committee\u2019s approach and that of the House.\n\n\u201cI promised you when we started a year ago that the sensitive nature of that material would, in fact, be protected,\u201d he said. \u201cThe vice chairman and I have done everything in our power to do that.\u201d", "keywords": ["mr", "gop", "statement", "leaked", "intelligence", "senators", "leaders", "texts", "fox", "warner", "house", "republicans", "senate", "committee", "say", "published"], "polarity": 0.07974109224109223, "subjectivity": 0.40522163022163016},

And that uncertainty has reawakened old anxieties about the sincerity of his political promises. His next move on guns will test his relationship with one of the most loyal and powerful elements of his base.\n\nRepublican strategists say that movement in polling for tighter restrictions on gun sales has been notable among Republican voters, a shift that they say is because Mr. Trump has spoken out about it \u2014 he is probably the only major figure who can move Republican voters on an issue.\n\nBut the president\u2019s connection with gun owners and their culture \u2014 which is infused with a sense of mistrust and grievance that he both feeds on and shares \u2014 suggests that he will be loath to betray this group of people he has repeatedly promised, \u201cI will never, ever let you down.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican who speaks regularly with the president as the leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said that he believed what is weighing on Mr. Trump now is \u201cless the N.R.A. than the Trump voter.\u201d\n\nThe dilemma for Mr. Trump is that those are often the same thing.\n\nHe is facing pressure from lawmakers in both parties to go further in restricting weapons than the N.R.A. would like.

Gun owners tended to be cut from the same blue-collar cloth that held together Mr. Trump\u2019s core constituency. They gravitated toward his tough talk on defending the Second Amendment in the same way they did on other issues like crime, trade and illegal immigration.\n\n\u201cHe had this connection to people who felt like he cared about them, their well-being, their family, safety and security,\u201d Mr. Bossie added.\n\nIn guns, Mr. Trump found an issue very similar in its emotional pull to immigration. It appealed to voters who believed that Democrats ignored the concerns of people like them and were hostile to their beliefs and culture. It fed a sense that the government was pursuing policies that would ultimately hurt them. And at its most extreme, it fanned the fear that a seemingly unstoppable force was on the verge of snatching away life as they knew it \u2014 their understanding of what it meant to be American.\n\nThese sentiments appealed to Mr. Trump, who has always tended to believe in conspiracies, especially ones hatched to undermine him.\n\nAs simpatico as the relationship appears now, the N.R.A.\u2019s backing of Mr. Trump in May 2016 was not a universally popular move among the membership. First, it was highly unusual. The group typically waited until the general election was well underway before getting involved in a presidential campaign. Second, it irritated many members who felt that the N.R.A. was rushing toward an endorsement before the deep wounds of a bitter Republican primary had healed.\n\nUnlike many social conservatives and evangelical Christians who remained wary of Mr. Trump \u2014 some of them right up until Election Day \u2014 the N.R.A. decided early on that it had too much at stake in the election not to back Hillary Clinton\u2019s opponent, whoever that may be.\n\nEspecially significant for the group was the fact that gun rights were at a tipping point on the Supreme Court after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, the author of the court\u2019s opinion in District of Columbia v. Heller, the landmark case that held that the Second Amendment protected the right to keep a loaded handgun at home for self-defense.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThrough more than $30 million in spending to support Mr. Trump, the N.R.A.\u2019s political arm turned into a virtual \u201csuper PAC\u201d for him, attacking Mrs. Clinton in the same way Mr. Trump did \u2014 as someone who would leave women vulnerable to attackers in their home by taking away their guns and who botched the response to the attacks in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nCurrent and former aides to Mr. Trump say that he loved the adoration that N.R.A. crowds would shower on him. After speaking at the group\u2019s annual meeting in Atlanta last year, one person who was with him described him as \u201clevitating\u201d with joy.\n\n\u201cYou came through for me, and I am going to come through for you,\u201d he told the crowd.\n\nGrover Norquist, the anti-tax activist who is also an N.R.A. board member, said the speech underscored for him that Mr. Trump had a relationship with gun owners unlike that of one he could recall with any other president. Mr. Trump spoke the language, calling the Second Amendment \u201ca sacred right\u201d and reassuring them that \u201cthe eight-year assault on your Second Amendment freedoms has come to a crashing end.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a very bonding moment,\u201d Mr. Norquist said, adding that Mr. Trump, who had a concealed gun permit when he lived in New York, did not have to fake it as so many other Republicans often do.\n\n\u201cThat was the connection people wanted.

Or, that Mrs. Roosevelt acted as her disabled husband\u2019s eyes, ears and legs while he was in office.\n\nThe exhibit, which runs through Oct. 1, doesn\u2019t broach how first ladies have coped with their husbands\u2019 infidelities (Mrs. Roosevelt, Mrs. Kennedy, Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. Trump among them).

Image Steel blast furnace 8 at the corporation ThyssenKrupp in Duisburg, Germany. Credit Friedemann Vogel/European Pressphoto Agency\n\nTo understand why the worry about President Trump\u2019s planned steel and aluminum tariffs goes so deep on Wall Street and in corporate America, don\u2019t think of Thursday\u2019s news as being about a new tariff on steel and aluminum.\n\nRather, think of it as a signal about the willingness of the president to ignore his most sober-minded advisers and put the global economy at risk to achieve his goal of better terms for American trade.\n\nMuch of the rhetoric from business and conservative groups has focused narrowly on the potential cost of the tariffs. \u201cMake no mistake, this is a tax on American families,\u201d the National Retail Federation said. It is a \u201chuge job-killing tax hike on American consumers,\u201d said Senator Mike Lee, a Utah Republican.\n\nIn terms of direction, this assessment is doubtless correct. The new tariffs will tend, over time, to make automobiles and beer cans and lots of other items more expensive. But in terms of magnitude, it is misleading.\n\nAs Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross argued in a CNBC interview on Friday, for most consumer items we\u2019re discussing trivial amounts of \u201ctax\u201d \u2014 an extra fraction of a penny for the can that contains Campbell\u2019s Soup, a few tenths of a percent on the price of a new car.\n\nSteel imports were worth about $30 billion in 2017, and aluminum imports around $17 billion, according to government data. Even in the simplest possible way of thinking of the potential cost of the new tariffs \u2014 just applying the 25 percent tax on steel and 10 percent tax on aluminum the president plans \u2014 we\u2019re talking about only $9 billion. And that\u2019s before accounting for the resulting shift toward domestic production that is the entire point of the policy.\n\nMore complex modeling would be needed to produce a reliable estimate of the cost of the tariffs, but the point is about the order of magnitude. These are not numbers that are enough to cause much damage to a $20 trillion economy, or to justify the $460 billion decline in the value of the stock market that took place between Thursday\u2019s open and Friday midday.\n\nThis market drop makes more sense if you look at the president\u2019s announcement not in terms of what it means for imported steel and aluminum, but rather what it says about the president himself.\n\nThe most consistent economic idea running through President Trump\u2019s decades in public life has been a conviction that the United States is being duped in the global trade arena. He has denounced China, called for ripping apart the North American Free Trade Agreement, and accused generations of American trade negotiators of being incompetent.\n\nYet in the first 13 months of the Trump administration, even as the president kept using bombastic language about trade, any formal action was restrained.\n\nAn incident from April is instructive. After leaks indicating that Mr. Trump planned to withdraw the United States from Nafta, there was an onslaught of phone calls to the White House from C.E.O.\u2019s and international leaders. And pro-trade advisers worked to get the president\u2019s ear.\n\nHe backed off, saying the next day that he would give Nafta renegotiation a try.\n\nWhen the administration has acted on trade \u2014 with tariffs on solar panels and washing machines, most notably \u2014 the moves have been relatively narrow, fitting comfortably with precedent and unlikely to spark global blowback.\n\nLately, there has even been talk that the administration might reverse course and move to rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade deal that the United States pulled out of at the start of the Trump administration.\n\nMore broadly, financial markets spent the first year of the Trump presidency gaining comfort that investors could count on the administration to deliver business-friendly economic policy, regardless of presidential bombast. That came through in such areas as the tax law (which cut the corporate income tax rate substantially) and appointments to key economic posts (like the former private equity executive Jerome Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve).\n\nThen came Thursday.\n\nMr. Trump not only overruled his more pro-trade advisers, but he also did so in an impromptu way, seemingly setting policy before the details had been worked out and without buy-in from across his own administration.\n\nAnd by invoking national security concerns as the rationale for the action, the president was setting a precedent that could give other countries more wiggle room to use security as a reason for imposing tariffs on American goods.\n\nMoreover, on Friday, rather than try to tamp down fears of an all-out trade war, President Trump appeared to relish the idea. In a Twitter message, he said that for a large country like the United States, trade wars are \u201cgood\u201d and \u201ceasy to win.\u201d\n\nFinancial markets tend to extrapolate, looking at small pieces of information today to project what the future will look like. That\u2019s why when a company reports disappointing financial results for a single quarter \u2014 missing an earnings target by a few million dollars, for example \u2014 markets sometime lop billions from the company\u2019s value.\n\nThe United States economy, in the aftermath of the tariff announcement, is the equivalent. The steel and aluminum tariffs are manageable. But if the president is so gung-ho about a trade war, and is now willing to ignore his more cautious advisers, what comes next might not be.\n\nNeil Irwin is a senior economics correspondent for The Upshot.

He has also disputed that the review of Bears Ears was related to the potential for energy production, suggesting that the agency\u2019s own surveys showed there was not a great deal of potential there.\n\n\u201cWe also have a pretty good idea of, certainly, the oil and gas potential \u2014 not much!\u201d Mr. Zinke said last year. \u201cSo Bears Ears isn\u2019t really about oil and gas.\u201d\n\nMost of the deliberations took place behind closed doors. The internal Interior Department emails \u2014 more than 25,000 pages in total \u2014 were obtained by The New York Times after it sued the agency in federal court with the assistance of the Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic at Yale University Law School. The lawsuit cited the agency\u2019s failure to respond to an open records request in August asking for internal records related to the deliberations.\n\nThe bulk of the documents made public by the Interior Department \u2014 about 20,000 pages of them \u2014 detail the yearslong effort during the Obama administration to create new monuments, including input from environmental groups, Indian tribes, state officials and members of Congress. President Barack Obama created or expanded 29 national monuments during his tenure, representing a total of about 553 million acres, more than any of his predecessors.\n\nThe remaining pages, a total of approximately 4,500 files, relate to the Trump administration\u2019s reconsideration of these actions by Mr. Obama and other presidents.\n\nPhoto\n\nHeather Swift, the Interior Department spokeswoman, said in a statement that, in reviewing monuments, \u201cThe Secretary took into consideration the views of a variety of interested parties, such as members of congress, governors, state and tribal leaders, and the public, including the views of those parties as to possible revised monument boundaries. One such organization that weighed in was the State of Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration (SITLA) which is responsible for funding so the children of Utah receive a quality education.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMatthew Whitlock, a spokesman for Senator Hatch, said that the senator has been involved in discussions around Bears Ears for years. He emphasized that some of the land had long been designated to help fund local schools, and that Senator Hatch\u2019s interest was to protect the school funding.\n\nThe internal Interior Department emails and memos also show the central role that concerns over gaining access to coal reserves played in the decision by the Trump administration to shrink the size of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument by about 47 percent, to just over 1 million acres.\n\nMr. Zinke\u2019s staff developed a series of estimates on the value of coal that could potentially be mined from a section of Grand Staircase called the Kaiparowits plateau. As a result of Mr. Trump\u2019s action, major parts of the area are no longer a part of the national monument.\n\n\u201cThe Kaiparowits plateau, located within the monument, contains one of the largest coal deposits in the United States,\u201d an Interior Department memo, issued in the spring of 2017, said. About 11.36 billion tons are \u201ctechnologically recoverable,\u201d it projected.\n\nFrom the start of the Interior Department review process, agency officials directed staff to figure out how much coal, oil and natural gas \u2014 as well as grass for cattle grazing and timber \u2014 had been put essentially off limits, or made harder to access, by the decision to designate the areas as national monuments.\n\nPhoto\n\nOne memo, for example, asked Interior staff to prepare a report on each national monument, with a yellow highlighter on the documents emphasizing the need to examine in detail \u201cannual production of coal, oil, gas and renewables (if any) on site; amount of energy transmission infrastructure on site (if any).\u201d It was followed up by a reminder to staff in June to also look at how the decision to create new National Monuments in Utah might have hurt area mines.\n\n\u201cSorry about this, but this came from DOI late yesterday,\u201d Timothy Fisher, the leader of the National Monuments and Conservation Areas program at Interior wrote to his colleagues, referring to the Department of Interior headquarters in Washington. \u201cAre there mines or processing facilities near or adjacent to a National Monument?\u201d he wrote. He also asked how the protection of the federal lands may have affected mining.\n\nIn another email exchange, in May, two Bureau of Land Management officials said that Mr. Zinke\u2019s chief of staff for policy, Downey Magallanes, had phoned to ask for information on a uranium mill in or near the Bears Ears monument. The request sought \u201ceconomic data to the extent available,\u201d as well as grazing and hunting maps.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd on July 17, Ms. Magallanes and Mr. Zinke\u2019s counselor for energy policy, Vincent DeVito, met with representatives of a uranium mining company. The company, Energy Fuels Resources Inc., said its representatives hoped to discuss its White Mesa uranium mill as well as the Daneros uranium mine, both adjacent to the Bears Ears monument.\n\nIn addition to Paul Goranson, a top executive at Energy Fuels Resources, the meeting included Mary Bono, a former Republican congresswoman from California; and Andrew Wheeler, then a lobbyist at the firm Faegre Baker Daniels Consulting and now awaiting confirmation to be deputy administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nMs. Swift, the Interior Department spokeswoman, said that no uranium mine or milling operations were located within the boundaries of either the original or modified Bears Ears National Monument.\n\nThe debate over oil and gas reserves below the ground in Bears Ears started during the Obama administration, the documents show, with officials from Utah State Board of Education writing to the Interior Department objecting to the plan to designate the area as a national monument.\n\nBefore Utah became a state, in 1896, the federal government granted so-called trust lands to support state institutions, like the public schools, given that nearly 70 percent of the land in the state is federally controlled.\n\nThe state has generated more than $1.7 billion in revenue from the trust lands to support public schools, mostly by selling off mineral rights and allowing private companies to extract oil or gas. The Bears Ears National Monument created by President Obama in 2016 included about 110,000 acres of these trust lands, eliminating the potential for resource sales, the state said.\n\nJohn Andrews, associate director of the Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration, which oversees the lands designated for school funding, acknowledged that the new Bears Ears boundaries approved by Mr. Trump, which reduced the land removed from the trust\u2019s management to about 22,000 acres, reflected his group\u2019s request to exclude trust lands from federal protection.\n\nBut he noted that Mr. Trump ultimately reduced the monument by a much larger amount than his organization had sought.\n\n\u201cObviously they were looking at facts other than the ones we had raised, we assume,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Whitlock, the spokesman for Mr. Hatch, said, \u201cSenator Hatch is grateful these emails have been released because they make very clear that his priority in addressing the Bears Ears situation was looking out for the people of Utah.\u201d", "keywords": ["mr", "monument", "interior", "national", "lands", "bears", "utah", "emails", "shrink", "department", "central", "ears", "oil", "decision", "state"], "polarity": 0.08378363197983452, "subjectivity": 0.46774471660547595},

For the November election, Mr. Lamb\u2019s hometown, Mt.

Republican leaders are seeking to block the new map in federal court.\n\nIn conversations with voters, the failure of politicians to keep their promises was a common theme, enveloping the White House, Congress and the reason for the special election in the first place.

Mr. Cohn, who almost left last year after Mr. Trump\u2019s response to a white nationalist march in Charlottesville, Va., indicated he was waiting to see whether Mr. Trump goes through with the tariffs, people familiar with his thinking said.\n\nThe chaotic rollout also reflected the departure of another White House official, Rob Porter, who as the staff secretary had a key role in keeping the paper flowing in the West Wing and who had backed Mr. Cohn in his free-trade views. Mr. Porter was forced out last month after facing accusations of spousal abuse.\n\nIt was the second day in a row that Mr. Trump blindsided Republicans and his own aides. On Wednesday, in another televised session at the White House, he embraced the stricter gun control measures backed by Democrats and urged lawmakers to revive gun-safety regulations that are opposed by the National Rifle Association and most of his party.

Mr. Trump has few fixed views on any issue, but he has been consistent on his antipathy for free trade since the 1980s, when he took out newspaper ads warning about American deficits with Japan \u2014 a concern that has shifted to China in recent years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe W.T.O. has been a disaster for this country,\u201d Mr. Trump said Thursday, asserting that China\u2019s economic rise coincided with its entry into the World Trade Organization. \u201cIt has been great for China and terrible for the United States, and great for other countries.\u201d\n\nBut a president who has long tried to impose his version of reality on the world is finding the limits of that strategy. Without Mr. Porter playing a stopgap role on trade, the debate has been marked by a lack of focus on policy and planning, according to several aides.\n\nMorale in the West Wing has sunk to a new low, these people said. In private conversations, Mr. Trump lashes out regularly at Attorney General Jeff Sessions with a vitriol that stuns members of his staff. Some longtime advisers said that Mr. Trump regards Mr. Sessions\u2019s decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation as the \u201coriginal sin,\u201d which the president thinks has left him exposed.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s children, meanwhile, have grown exasperated with Mr. Kelly, seeing him as a hurdle to their father\u2019s success and as antagonistic to their continued presence, according to several people familiar with their thinking. Anthony Scaramucci, an ally of some in the Trump family, whom Mr. Kelly fired as communications director after only 11 days, intensified his criticism of the chief of staff in a series of news interviews on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nYet Mr. Trump is also frustrated with Mr. Kushner, whom he now views as a liability because of his legal entanglements, the investigations of the Kushner family\u2019s real estate company and the publicity over having his security clearance downgraded, according to two people familiar with his views. In private conversations, the president vacillates between sounding regretful that Mr. Kushner is taking arrows and annoyed that he is another problem to deal with.\n\nPrivately, some aides have expressed frustration that Mr. Kushner and his wife, the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, have remained at the White House, despite Mr. Trump at times saying they never should have come to the White House and should leave. Yet aides also noted that Mr. Trump has told the couple that they should keep serving in their roles, even as he has privately asked Mr. Kelly for his help in moving them out.\n\nTo some staff members, the chaos feels reminiscent of the earliest days of the Trump administration. Some argue Mr. Kelly should have carried out a larger staff shake-up when he came in.

When it ended, you see it going up.\u201d \u2014 Senator Dianne Feinstein.\n\nThis needs context.\n\nIn the past, Ms. Feinstein has referenced an analysis by Louis Klarevas, a lecturer at the University of Massachusetts Boston, that found the assault weapons ban drastically reduced gun massacres.\n\nBut it\u2019s difficult to directly link declines in crime or gun violence to any specific law, given the limited scope and loopholes in each one, according to most experts and research.\n\nAs The Times has previously reported:\n\nThe 1994 ban on assault weapons has become a particular and recent subject of intense debate. The N.R.A. has cited a 2004 analysis funded by the Justice Department to argue that the \u201cban could not be credited with any reduction in crime.\u201d On the other hand, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, has claimed in a Twitter post that \u201cthe number of gun massacres fell by 37%\u201d while the ban was in place. Christopher Koper, a professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., and the lead author of the study that is cited by the N.R.A., has repeatedly said that the ban had mixed effects and final results would not be immediately evident. \u201cMy work is often cited in misleading ways that don\u2019t give the full picture,\u201d Mr. Koper said Thursday in an email. \u201cThese laws can modestly reduce shootings overall\u201d and reduce the number and severity of mass shootings.\n\n\u201cThese shooters typically are males. They\u2019re white and they\u2019re suicidal.\u201d \u2014 Senator Steve Daines, Republican of Montana\n\nTrue.\n\nA database maintained by Mother Jones, a progressive magazine, shows that 95 out of 97 mass shootings from 1982 to 2018 involved male gunmen. Fifty-five were committed by white men.\n\n\u201cThe states that have these background checks, they have a 38 percent lower domestic homicide rate \u2014 this is domestic violence.\u201d \u2014 Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota\n\nCausation is not clear.\n\nMs. Klobuchar is probably referring to a report from Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control advocacy group, that claims \u201c38 percent fewer women\u201d are \u201cshot to death by intimate partners\u201d in states that require background checks for all handgun sales.\n\nThis analysis, however, does not account for other factors that contribute to domestic violence, leading other researchers to question the sweeping conclusion about background checks.\n\nApril Zeoli, a professor at Michigan State University who studies intimate partner violence, called the Everytown estimate a \u201cback of the napkin\u201d calculation.\n\nMs. Zeoli\u2019s research has found that state laws restricting access to firearms for people who have been convicted of domestic violence result in declines in intimate partner homicides; specifically, 11 percent from laws that mandate buyers to get a permit whether they\u2019re purchasing from licensed or private dealers, she said. (Other research also shows this.)\n\nUnlike Everytown, Ms. Zeoli also looked at state domestic violence laws, poverty and divorce rates, average amounts of public assistance, educational attainment gaps between men and women, homicides not related to domestic violence, percentage of suicides by firearms as a proxy for gun ownership rates and law enforcement availability.\n\n\u201cThose are areas where there are no guns. The reason I carry a concealed firearm everywhere I go is because I don\u2019t know where those gun-free zones are, that I may walking through at the mall, or at the doughnut shop, or wherever I might be.\u201d \u2014 Representative John Rutherford, Republican of Florida\n\nThis needs context.\n\nAs Mr. Rutherford and Mr. Trump discussed concealed-carry laws, Mr. Trump said, \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed concealed in a gun-free zone.\u201d The exchange highlights how amorphous the term \u201cgun-free zone\u201d has become.\n\nFederal law prohibits firearms in grade schools, but makes explicit exceptions for security personnel and instructional purposes (hunting classes, for example). So, Mr. Rutherford is wrong to state that there are never guns in \u201cgun-free zones.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, at least eight states allow concealed carry for teachers at grade schools, and two others have eased restrictions, according to the Giffords Law Center, a gun control advocacy group.\n\nPrivate businesses may also ban civilian use of firearms on their premises, but state laws vary on how and on the extent to which a business can opt out.\n\nTexas has very specific requirements for the signs businesses put up to indicate that they do not allow firearms on their properties. (For example, they must be in both English and Spanish.) North Carolina requires signs to be \u201cconspicuous,\u201d while Florida has no explicit rules. Florida is one of 23 states that require business owners to allow guns in cars parked on company property.\n\n\u201cPeople just want to dismiss concealed-carry permits. They do actually increase safety.\u201d \u2014 Representative Steve Scalise, Republican of Louisiana\n\nThis is disputed.\n\nWhen asked what data Mr. Scalise was referring to, a spokesman told The Times, \u201cSince the early \u201990s, the significant increase in the issuance of concealed-carry permits by states has been accompanied by a significant drop in violent crime rates \u2014 and that includes millions of new permits being issued in the last decade or so.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman cited the work of John R. Lott Jr., an economist and gun rights advocate whose book \u201cMore Guns, Less Crime\u201d makes the case that \u201cpassing concealed-handgun laws deters violent crime.\u201d But Mr. Lott\u2019s findings have been questioned by other academics.\n\nIn 2005, a panel at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine concluded that \u201cno link between right-to-carry laws and changes in crime is apparent in the raw data, even in the initial sample.\u201d\n\nOther researchers have reached an opposite conclusion. In a 2017 study, John Donohue, a professor at Stanford Law School, found that states that adopted right-to-carry laws saw an increase in violent crime.\n\nLinda Qiu is a fact-check reporter, based in Washington.

But it hedged its narrative bets: The first season balanced Diane\u2019s challenges fitting in at her new firm with a story line about a Madoff-like financial scandal that didn\u2019t have a racial dimension (and in which the principal characters were mostly white).\n\nAs Season 2 opens (it begins streaming Sunday on CBS All Access), that\u2019s still the approach \u2014 two continuing story lines (outside of the legal cases of the week) that share Diane and several other characters, but are essentially separate, in their own bubbles.

It also arrested more than 600 drug traffickers and captured nearly 3,500 people trying to enter the country illegally.\n\nThe Coast Guard also rescued nearly 12,000 people after deadly hurricanes hit the East Coast, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands last year.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Known primarily for its role in search-and-rescue missions, the Coast Guard has in recent years taken on missions around the world that include guarding the president and even cybersecurity.\n\nBut for years, the Coast Guard has suffered even as its mission has expanded, in part because of its image as a service that towed ships or searched for people lost at sea. Another issue has been a lack of funding. The Coast Guard does not receive any additional money from Congress for its work in areas such as disaster relief.\n\nThe Trump administration, in addition to moving to increase the Coast Guard\u2019s budget, has lavished praise on the service.\n\nDuring a celebration of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s 15th anniversary on Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence singled out the Coast Guard. \u201cThe men and women of the Coast Guard have inspired the nation,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the administration\u2019s relationship with the Coast Guard has also been frayed.\n\nThe initial Trump White House spending plan would have cut the Coast Guard\u2019s funding by 14 percent, or about $1.3 billion, to help pay for Mr. Trump\u2019s border wall. The other military services \u2014 the Army, the Air Force, the Navy and the Marine Corps \u2014 all saw funding increases.\n\nThe administration reversed itself and increased the Coast Guard\u2019s budget request to, among other things, build a new Arctic icebreaker for the first time in 40 years as the United States competes with Russia and China in the polar region.\n\nThe vessel will not be ready until 2023, however, and will be one of only two such ships that the United States is operating. By comparison, Russia has 40 icebreakers and 11 more in production.\n\n\u201cRussia has really been asserting itself in the Arctic, and we\u2019ve been asserting ourselves with paper, with reports,\u201d Admiral Zukunft said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAdmiral Zukunft has not been shy about challenging the administration: Last year, when Mr. Trump posted on Twitter his intent to ban transgender troops from serving in the military, Admiral Zukunft said in a speech that same day that he would continue to support transgender troops under his command.", "keywords": ["commandant", "united", "guards", "guard", "zukunft", "coast", "states", "departing", "challenges", "administration", "homeland", "continue", "successes", "drug", "trump", "lays"], "polarity": 0.04913023088023087, "subjectivity": 0.3420624098124099},

Rather than let incomplete or inaccurate coverage circulate, officials often try to fill out the picture or provide a defense. But Justice Department rules prohibit the dissemination of confidential information, and the inspector general\u2019s report is expected to criticize Mr. McCabe for disclosing the existence of a continuing investigation to The Journal.\n\nWhen an inquiry uncovers evidence that an agent has violated Justice Department regulations, the inspector general typically refers the matter to the F.B.I.\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility, which handles questions of punishment.\n\nIt is unclear whether the inspector general will identify others who spoke about the Clinton investigation. But Mr. McCabe is by far the most prominent subject. Mr. Trump has taunted him on Twitter, writing in December that he \u201cis racing the clock to retire with full benefits. 90 days to go?!!!\u201d Mr. McCabe is eligible to retire March 18.\n\nMr. Trump has animosity toward Mr. McCabe for several reasons, including his close ties to the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey, whom Mr. Trump fired last year. But the president is particularly bothered by the fact that Mr. McCabe\u2019s wife, Jill, ran as a Democrat in a failed campaign for a State Senate seat in Virginia. Her campaign received hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from a political committee run by Terry McAuliffe, the Virginia governor at the time and a longtime ally of the Clintons.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLater, after Mrs. McCabe lost the race, Mr. McCabe was promoted to deputy director and oversaw the Clinton investigation. Though Mr. McCabe sought ethics and legal advice about whether to recuse himself, some in the F.B.I. considered his involvement a conflict of interest. Ultimately, amid scrutiny from the news media, Mr. Comey pressured Mr. McCabe to recuse himself. The inspector general is examining whether Mr. McCabe should have done so earlier.\n\nMr. Trump has seized on that issue in repeatedly criticizing Mr. McCabe, a lifelong Republican who did not vote in the 2016 election. In face-to-face meetings with Mr. McCabe, the president questioned how he had voted and needled him about his wife. In one instance, he called Mrs. McCabe \u201ca loser,\u201d according to people familiar with the conversation, which was first reported by NBC News.\n\nMr. McCabe\u2019s allies at the F.B.I. say that Mr. Trump is also eager to discredit Mr. McCabe because he can corroborate Mr. Comey\u2019s accounts of meetings with Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. McCabe rose quickly through the F.B.I. ranks and was seen as a new model for the second-in-command when he was promoted in 2016. The F.B.I. had transformed from a law-and-order agency to an integral part of the nation\u2019s intelligence apparatus, and Mr. McCabe, who graduated from Duke and Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, was picked not based on a career of street work but based on his intellect and decision-making.\n\nThat won him equal parts praise and disdain inside the F.B.I., with longtime agents accusing him of having ascended too quickly.\n\nMr. McCabe is on leave while he awaits retirement.

She takes comfort from local efforts like a project in Utica, N.Y., where Bosnian Muslim immigrants and local Unitarian Christians watched a Super Bowl together. She applauds aggressive racial integration programs like those run by the American military. She cites her own teaching experience in small seminars at Yale, where students from divergent backgrounds overcame disagreements to achieve mutual respect, sometimes even friendship.\n\nPhoto\n\nYet the scholar in Chua acknowledges that these individual experiences offer less of a social lesson than she would wish.\n\n\u201cStudies show that minimal or superficial exposure to out-group members can actually worsen group division. \u2026 Negative interactions with people from other groups also increase group hostility. So merely putting members of different groups in the same space is not enough and indeed can aggravate political tribalism.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Chua falls back on the very attitude to which she turned her sharply skeptical gaze at the beginning of the book: the conviction that the United States was, is and will remain an exceptional nation, different from all the others. In her introduction, Chua remarked that the United States as a supertribal entity indifferent to ethnicity and culture became at best a partial reality only a generation ago. By book\u2019s end, however, the battered ideal has been polished and refurbished.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Will we, telling ourselves \u2018These immigrants are different,\u2019 be the weak link, the first generation to fail? Will we forget who we are?\u201d That\u2019s inspiring, and even more so are the citations of Martin Luther King Jr., Lin-Manuel Miranda and Langston Hughes that finish the book.\n\nInspiring \u2014 but not wholly reassuring. A lot of the interest of \u201cPolitical Tribes\u201d comes from the strong sense it emanates of an author arguing with herself. Chua both condemns tribalism and respects its power. She insists that the United States alone of nations among the earth has often transcended it \u2014 and then presents impressive contrary evidence from the past and the present. Chua reckons with the many tribalisms of the American past: ethnic, religious and racial. She hopes for a future in which tribalism fades \u2014 even as she mercilessly details its accumulating strength.\n\nAs Chua notes, tribes can coalesce out of previously unrelated pieces. Immigrants to Europe from North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia \u2014 of different languages, ethnicities, folkways and religious practices \u2014 raised children who created for themselves a new identity as post-ethnic Muslims. ISIS, as Chua mordantly observes, is in its own way a melting pot, bringing together young men and women from across Europe, Asia and the Americas to fight for a new ideology. She quotes a New York Times article about young British girls lured to ISIS. For them, \u201cIslam is punk rock.\u201d\n\nTribes can be created by fission as well as by fusion. Chua suggests that in the United States, divisions that would once have been understood as class divides have been reinterpreted in our time as cultural, even when they are not ethnic. \u201cWhite Americans often hold their biggest disdain for other white Americans \u2014 the ones on the opposite side of the cultural divide.\u201d\n\nThese fast-evolving and ever-changing identities may look contingent from the outside. They feel overwhelmingly powerful to those inside. Chua repeatedly scolds American policymakers for underestimating the importance of ethnocultural identity in Vietnam in the 1960s, Venezuela in the 1990s and Afghanistan in the 2000s. Through her book pulses an evident worry that tribal claims are now overpowering national ones within the United States. If she cannot quite bring herself to make her own anxieties explicit \u2014 or figure out what if anything to do to address them \u2014 she is hardly alone.

I think Trump\u2019s had a relatively good two or three weeks.\u201d\n\nEven with high-school students staging protests against gun laws in front of the White House?\n\n\u201cO.K., look, there is an enormous cultural divide between England and America on guns,\u201d Mr. Farage admitted. \u201cI think, you know, the concept of bump stocks, just bizarre. Just bizarre that that should be allowed. And I\u2019m a little surprised it\u2019s taken so long since Vegas for some of these things to get said. And should there be scrutiny on people that go in the shops and want to buy high-velocity rifles? Of course there should.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHe wondered if all schools in America will soon become \u201clike Heathrow Airport,\u201d with metal detectors and armed security.\n\nBut characteristically, he praised Mr. Trump. \u201cAt least that conversation is happening. I think that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\nMr. Farage is perhaps the president\u2019s closest ally in England. When he was in town this time last year, he dined with the president, the first lady, Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner and Rick Scott, the governor of Florida, at Trump Hotel. (Mr. Farage gets some precious face time and a photo-op with the president this week, too, backstage at CPAC.) Curiously, this special relationship has not endeared him to the British establishment in D.C.; when the embassy had a party for Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, Mr. Farage was not among the hundreds who received an invitation, despite the fact that he is in town half a dozen times a year, by his own assessment.\n\nAnd the same month Mr. Trump won the election, he tweeted that Mr. Farage should be named ambassador to the United States, sending the British government into an uproar.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m persona non grata,\u201d Mr. Farage said, with some pride. \u201cThe embassy here basically regrets Brexit and Trump. They won\u2019t say so, but they do. It\u2019s obvious. So the idea that the British embassy would not talk to me given my relationship with the president and with the people around him is, I do not necessarily think, in our national interest. But others can make their own minds up about that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe agreed that foreign relations between the White House and 10 Downing Street, the headquarters of British government, have only grown frostier in recent months. But not because of Mr. Trump, he insisted.\n\n\u201cHe has reached out, he\u2019s offered the hand of friendship, and frankly we\u2019ve spurned him,\u201d Mr. Farage said. In November President Trump was criticized by the British prime minister, Theresa May, after sharing violent anti-Muslim videos from a fringe British ultranationalist group on Twitter. He reacted defensively.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

It\u2019s certainly widespread, though: During Mr. Trump\u2019s first month in office, a petition to block him from making his first official state visit to England was signed more than a million times, at one point by more than a thousand people per minute.\n\nIf it were up to Mr. Farage, he would circumvent the British government entirely, rent out Wembley Stadium, invite Mr. Trump to speak, charge 20 pounds a ticket and donate the proceeds to charity.\n\n\u201cKnockout,\u201d he said gleefully. \u201cAre people going to protest against raising money for charity? They can if they want to!\u201d\n\nBack home, the political party that Mr. Farage headed for years and used to orchestrate Brexit, UKIP, voted last week to oust its leader, Henry Bolton, after it was revealed that his girlfriend had made racist remarks about Meghan Markle, Prince Harry\u2019s bride-to-be.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d Mr. Farage said, shaking his head angrily. \u201cI think Meghan Markle adds glamour and sparkle to the royal family.\u201d He thinks the royal wedding, and the fact that Ms. Markle is American, will be good for the country. \u201cHarry is regarded as Mr. Cool, and it further strengthens the Anglo-American relationship, so it gets ticks from me all the way around.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Farage\u2019s staunchest supporters have called for him to again lead UKIP, once referred to by David Cameron, the former British prime minister, as the party of \u201cfruitcakes, loonies and closet racists.\u201d (Mr. Farage considers this his very own \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d moment.)\n\nPhoto\n\nWould he consider running the party again? \u201cNo,\u201d he said, flatly, claiming he has aged out of party politics.\n\nStill, Mr. Farage retained enough vim to travel in September to Alabama to join an old friend, Steve Bannon, and campaign for Roy Moore in the special Senate election. The accompanying Breitbart headline read: \u201cBrexit Hero Farage in Alabama: Judge Roy Moore \u2018Not Going to Be Sucked Into the Swamp.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter Mr. Bannon was quoted accusing Donald Trump Jr. of treason in the book \u201cFire and Fury,\u201d he was defenestrated from the tallest tower of castle Breitbart and denounced on the The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial page by the right-wing megadonor Rebekah Mercer, whose father, Robert, reportedly has ties to Mr. Farage. (He refuses to elaborate on this relationship.)\n\nMr. Farage still speaks positively about Mr. Bannon but says that he has not talked to him since his ouster from Trumpworld. \u201cThings have gone rather wrong in the last few months,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Mr. Farage says he doesn\u2019t regret throwing his support behind Mr. Moore and grows testy when pressed on this. \u201cAll my staff know I\u2019ve got what I call the \u2018seven out of 10 rule.\u2019 As long as I\u2019m right seven times out of 10 in politics, it will be O.K. You can\u2019t get everything right.\u201d\n\nMr. Farage may soon have another reason to stick around the United States, particularly California. There has been talk of \u201cBrexit: The Movie\u201d and Mr. Farage says he has taken several Hollywood meetings.\n\n\u201cIt is quite a good little story,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a real David versus Goliath story, isn\u2019t it? And don\u2019t forget how long this took. I used to joke that I was the Billy Graham of Euroskeptic politics, just touring the country speaking.\u201d He looks up and notes: \u201cAnd I see he\u2019s died in the last 24 hours. What an amazing man. I love him. Just fantastic.\u201d\n\nKevin Spacey was among the actors mentioned as a possibility to play Mr. Farage. \u201cThat may well have changed,\u201d he said with a devilish grin.

Underwood Archives/Getty Images\n\n\u201cOur nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white \u2013 separate and unequal.\u201d\n\nFifty years ago, on March 1, 1968, these were the grim words of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, called the Kerner Commission after its chairman, Gov. Otto Kerner of Illinois.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson had established the commission to examine the disorders and violent protests in Detroit, Newark and well over 100 other American cities during the summer of 1967, and earlier. What it found was searing. \u201cWhat white Americans have never fully understood \u2013 but what the Negro can never forget \u2013 is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto,\u201d the commission concluded. \u201cWhite institutions created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it.\u201d\n\nMostly moderate and mostly white men, the members of the bipartisan panel carried the imprimatur of the political establishment. Their recommendations attracted widespread public debate. The paperback edition of the report sold over two million copies.\n\nOccupied by the Vietnam War and concerned about the legacy of his Great Society domestic agenda, Johnson distanced himself from the \u201ctwo societies\u201d warning. But the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Robert Kennedy strongly endorsed the commission\u2019s findings and recommendations before they were assassinated and before more protests erupted during that traumatic year of 1968.\n\nThe Kerner Commission recommended \u201cmassive and sustained\u201d investments in jobs and education to reduce poverty, inequality and racial injustice.

The overall poverty rate remains about the same today as it was 50 years ago; the total number of poor people has increased from over 25 million to well over 40 million, more than the population of California.\n\nMeanwhile, the rich have profited at the expense of most working Americans. Today, the top 1 percent receive 52 percent of all new income. Rich people are healthier and live longer. They get a better education, which produces greater gains in income. And their greater economic power translates into greater political power.\n\nFive Indicators America of the 1960s contrasted with the most recent available data.

Image Buckets of steel pipes waiting to be loaded onto a cargo ship in China. American steel producers have long complained about unfair practices. Credit China Network/Reuters\n\nPresident Trump announced today that his administration would impose a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and a 10 percent tariff on imported aluminum, on the grounds that other countries\u2019 trade practices endanger American national security by undermining domestic production. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nWhat is a tariff?\n\nIt is simply a tax placed on some particular class of imported goods. If the Trump administration follows through on the president\u2019s comments Thursday, a company bringing $100,000 of steel made in Canada into the United States would have to pay $25,000 to the government, effectively increasing its price. Tariffs are typically a governmental tool to protect domestic industries and raise revenue.\n\nWait, why did you say \u2018if\u2019 the administration follows through?\n\nThe president made the announcement at an event that was pulled together hastily, and while his preferences were broadly known, some congressional Republicans and business lobbyists were still taken by surprise. By Thursday afternoon, many allies of the president were imploring him to change his mind (the new tariffs are set to go into effect next week).\n\nAlthough President Trump\u2019s criticisms of trading practices by China and other countries have been a hallmark of his years in public life, it appears the details of this policy have not been fully worked through. The White House offered no real implementation details.\n\nWhat is the rationale?\n\nAmerican steel and aluminum companies have long complained of unfair practices by overseas competitors, especially Chinese state subsidies that encourage production. This can flood the global marketplace with metals, depress prices and make American production less economical than it otherwise would be.\n\nAmerican trade officials have sought redress in various ways, including a decision by the George W. Bush administration in 2002 to impose steel tariffs of up to 30 percent. But that was a more narrowly targeted law aimed at safeguarding domestic industries harmed by imports (the Trump administration has used that provision to impose tariffs on imported solar panels and washing machines).\n\nThe Trump administration is on more uncharted ground by basing the tariffs on national security concerns \u2014 Section 232 of a law enacted in the Cold War. The argument is that with domestic metals production undermined, the United States is left vulnerable in the event of conflict that disrupts trade flows.\n\nExpect furious lobbying in the days ahead to try to persuade the president to exclude military allies\u2019 metals from the tariffs. Defense Secretary James Mattis has warned that tariffs should be targeted so as not to damage relationships with allies, but it appears the president did not heed that advice.\n\nWho wins and who loses?\n\nThe big winners are the United States steel and aluminum industries, which have lobbied for years for this kind of aggressive government action.\n\nThe most immediate losers are the industries that rely on steel and aluminum as an input and will face higher prices. That includes some of the nation\u2019s biggest industries: the automobile sector; aerospace; heavy equipment; and construction. In short, the chassis of a Ford, the body of a Caterpillar bulldozer, the wings of a Boeing aircraft, and the steel girders inside a New York skyscraper are all about to get more expensive.\n\nAfter the president\u2019s announcement, Wall Street quickly reflected this divide: Shares of U.S. Steel and Century Aluminum were each up about 7 percent shortly afterward, while shares of Ford, Caterpillar and Boeing were each down about 3 percent.\n\nThe industries that use steel and aluminum are considerably larger as a share of the United States economy than are steel and aluminum producers. By one estimate, from Lydia Cox of Harvard and Kadee Russ of the University of California, Davis, steel-using industries employ 80 times as many people as steel-producing industries.\n\nBut what does this mean for consumers?\n\nThe simple answer is that goods containing metals will become more expensive. But there\u2019s not much reason to expect enormous price increases for most goods.\n\nFirst, the United States imports only about one-third of its steel, and the tariff would not apply to domestic production (aluminum is more heavily dependent on imports, with only 10 percent made domestically).\n\nSo prices will go up by only a fraction of the tariff amount. But consumers don\u2019t generally buy raw steel and aluminum. People buy consumer goods in which those raw materials are but one input. A car includes not just steel and aluminum but also plastics and textiles and glass, not to mention the computer circuitry that controls it all, the design know-how and assemblage work, along with a profit margin for both the automaker and the dealer.\n\nFor any given product, it is hard to predict whether producers will eat the cost of more expensive metals, pass the cost on in the form of higher prices, or both. Put differently: If your favorite beer producers are looking at paying an extra fraction of a cent for each aluminum can, they might just take on the cost themselves, they might raise prices, or they might split the difference. It is hard to know in advance how much of each will take place.\n\nSo does this matter for the economy?\n\nThe American economy is relatively strong at the moment, and has been historically resilient to most disruptions. Companies are good at restructuring their supply chains to minimize disruption because of tariffs like these. In most retrospective analyses, the 2002 Bush administration steel tariffs have been judged to be costly relative to the jobs that were saved, but they were hardly the cause of some economic disaster.\n\nThis action may create some jobs in domestic metals-producing industries, cost some jobs in fields where steel and aluminum are inputs, and push consumer prices a bit higher. The large and dynamic United States economy can handle it.\n\nThe risk comes from the potential ripple effects.\n\nAffected countries may well retaliate by ordering tariffs on American goods, and they could carefully target goods to cause economic or political pain. American exporters \u2014 whether they sell passenger airplanes or soybeans \u2014 should be nervous about the next shoe to fall. There are few winners in an all-out trade war like one that enveloped the world economy in the 1930s.\n\nIn particular, the Trump administration\u2019s invocation of national security concerns could set a precedent in which China and other nations are willing to use national security as grounds for tariffs, hurting the ability of the World Trade Organization to arbitrate disputes.\n\nThe real risk isn\u2019t that steel and aluminum are a bit more expensive, though that is likely to be the case. It\u2019s that an entire system of global trade, which the United States helped build, might be undermined.\n\nNeil Irwin is a senior economics correspondent for The Upshot.

I\u2019d love to jump right in and hear your aspirations for Prairie View. What do you hope to accomplish in your time as president? I assume you had many offers to lead other colleges. Why was Prairie View different?\n\nRuth Simmons: Well, I\u2019m a native of Texas, and one of the things that I did when I returned to Houston after I retired from Brown was think about the ways I could use my experience to help the community. I started with small ventures in the city, but I hadn\u2019t thought really that another university would be in my life. But when I was approached by Prairie View, I thought immediately about its significant impact on my brother, who went there. And what Dillard did for me.\n\nI grew up in a segregated neighborhood in Grapeland, Tex., with very little experience with the world. The transition that Dillard enabled for me was extremely valuable. As an undergraduate, I began to grow a sense of confidence that helped me move from a fairly insular environment to a bigger stage when I went to graduate school.\n\nMy aspirations for Prairie View are to essentially make sure the university is continuing to do the same thing for students today that it did for my brother \u2014 and Dillard did for me. And that is to offer the advantage of a strong education that will prepare students for the careers they want, in a social and cultural context that helps them develop the confidence to perform after graduation.\n\nAs president, that means focusing on time-honored strategies to success that apply to universities everywhere: worrying about the faculty who are recruited here, the campus experience, and whether we are providing the leadership and internship opportunities that students need. It means worrying about the reputation of the university. It\u2019s obviously a much more competitive world today than it was when I was a student, but the underlying work to move the university to a level of achievement that makes students and alumni proud is the same.\n\nM.J.: What do you see as some of the major challenges facing historically black colleges and universities?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: The general challenge for H.B.C.U.s is not unlike the problem many universities face today, and that is the financial model. Being tuition dependent has become a large problem for all universities. H.B.C.U.s are dependent on raising money, but that is a reality that most universities obviously face. So it very much depends on the question of whether the schools have a good-enough foundation because of secure financing. When it comes to the federal government\u2019s role in supporting H.B.C.U.s, I think we don\u2019t yet understand the extent to which they will be affected by the changes in Washington today. To say that many are not hopeful in this moment is an understatement. We just don\u2019t know.\n\nFrankly, that\u2019s why I advocate for developing enough financial independence to secure the future of our institutions. That means looking for different revenue streams, looking to increase our ability to raise funds and finding alternate programs that help to bring more income into our university. The only strategy cannot be to persistently raise tuition, making college outside the reach of many families.\n\nM.J.: You\u2019ve led several institutions that are all very different from each other, and the topic of leadership is something you\u2019ve talked a lot about. In another interview with The Times you said that it\u2019s much easier to lead people \u201cif you convey the underlying principles.\u201d Can you elaborate?\n\nR.S.: One thing that I\u2019ve learned is that the perceptions of what it takes to be a leader are often based on prototypical models that don\u2019t have much truth in reality. People look at the institutions that I have led and they see dissimilarities. I see similarities. When people think in terms of leadership, they\u2019re often thinking about the kind of specific skills needed for different types of enterprises. I think of leadership as more of a disposition \u2014 the ability to step into a situation to learn about the history of the enterprise, the opportunities that it faces, the culture that exists and the people who are served by it. To look at all of that, to listen to stakeholders and then to think about how that enterprise or institution should best be served. There is no one model of leadership if you approach it that way. What I have tried to do wherever I go is to start where the institution is rather than try to import particularly rigid constructs from other places. In that sense, I think a leader is more than anything else a facilitator. A person who is able to come in to show a community a picture of what it is, to provide some insight into what it could be \u2014 how it could be different or improved perhaps \u2014 and then enlist the help of people who are there and others who support that institution in order to move forward together.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nI don\u2019t subscribe to the model of hero leadership, which is identifying somebody who can come in and have magical powers and then wield the wand and fix things that have not been fixable before. I don\u2019t see that. I think leadership is a community affair.\n\nM.J.: That makes sense. So how do you approach educating the current generation of students at Prairie View to lead in the way you described?\n\nR.S.: People today are fond of leadership programs that theorize about the profile and tenets of leadership. And students anxiously get involved in those programs. I rather think that our entire campuses are incubators of leadership even without the formality of such programs because if we\u2019re doing what we should be doing, we are acclimating students to an environment in which they have to learn to work with others who are very different from themselves. And that seems to me to be the first requirement of leadership. To actually learn to work with people in a respectful and inclusive way is inordinately important. A campus provides one of the best opportunities for people to be able to do that because you sit in class alongside people whom you initially don\u2019t know. You are discussing your ideas, having people respond to them and often rejecting what you\u2019re saying. You are joining organizations that have certain aims that are being advanced by the collective, so you\u2019re learning how to facilitate. You are asked to step into leadership roles either through student government or organizations. Even in the classroom context you might play a leadership role. You have to learn to express yourself, to be convincing, to write out your ideas, to be more thoughtful than you\u2019d ordinarily be. All of those things are components of leadership.\n\nM.J.: Some would argue that social media, or perhaps disagreements over the concept of safe spaces, have made it more challenging for people to come together and to work together.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: Yeah, I would say that people frequently say that, but that has certainly not been my experience. I would say that in my days as a student, the tensions were higher, the disagreements were greater, the separation among us was certainly more pronounced. And people are kind of inventing a new narrative, that things are so much worse today than they were in the past. I don\u2019t buy that. I think we have new terminology, because the modern sciences of psychology and sociology and so forth and modern media have enabled us to peer into areas that we were not able to see as easily as before. And so when you have social media and all of the ways in which people can now say whatever they want to say \u2014 in an unartful or offensive way \u2014 that turns the volume up to be sure. But it doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t there before.\n\nI would say that the current situation ought to give us much more practice in how to engage with each other because it is not underground. It\u2019s out front, it\u2019s in the open. The media today and the things that are being reported should be upsetting or troubling to students, my goodness. But it may be an even better opportunity to engage students.\n\nAs a teacher, as an educator, I would say these times are especially fertile for teaching the skills that are needed in a world in which there are many types of people, many perspectives and so forth. Students don\u2019t need to feel silenced by the current situation. When students at Brown came to me and said, you know, they were hurt because somebody asked them about their hair, and they were tired of that and they didn\u2019t want any part of it, I would say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s just too bad!\u201d Somebody asked you about your hair, tell them about your hair. You are in college not to hide from that. You\u2019re there to teach the world about yourself, you\u2019re there to learn about others and to teach them about who you are. So I\u2019d rather think this whole notion of protecting people from that is something that we have to take in hand and deal with. And help students see the opportunity in that because if they engage with people who have those kinds of perspectives, they are going to be much stronger in the end than if they run away.\n\nM.J.: Do you see the situation differently for students at H.B.C.U.s? You mentioned that Dillard gave you the space to learn and build confidence before heading to graduate school.\n\nR.S.: There is a narrative that many people have for H.B.C.U.s. People see them as a monolith, or only see them as filling a gap that exists for African-Americans. H.B.C.U.s are not a brand. They are institutions with a certain history \u2014 they were originally set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for education \u2014 but they are not all alike, and are very diverse in what they offer.\n\nPrairie View, for example, is the second-oldest public institution of higher education in the state of Texas. It was set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for ex-slaves and whites. For a long time it provided educational opportunities for black students that wouldn\u2019t have been open to them otherwise. In nursing, architecture, engineering and other STEM fields at a time when many blacks were not able to go into those areas, the university was able to facilitate the entry of blacks into those professions.\n\nM.J.: Yes, this is something that Nikole Hannah-Jones has written about for The New York Times Magazine, in particular how Xavier University of Louisiana sends more black students to medical school than almost any other college in the country. I read that Prairie View has many more students who graduate with degrees in architecture and engineering.\n\nR.S.: Yes, going to Dillard is not like going to Prairie View. So the student who chooses to go to one H.B.C.U. may not find another appealing. That has to do with the unique features of the place, the academic culture and so on, the traditions. All of that makes a big difference.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen I went off to college, I was just trying to find a place where I could be a student without impediments that in that day and time were fairly widely known to be substantial if you enrolled in a majority-white institution. There was no question that in 1963, if you went off to college in the South, you had to be very careful about where you studied. The racial dynamic was very challenging at that time. One of the things I\u2019m learning now is that many of the students I speak to at Prairie View today have the same kinds of thoughts that I had those many years ago. They ask themselves, where can I feel comfortable so that I don\u2019t have to worry about anything but my academic work? So certainly that plays a factor in why students apply to H.B.C.U.s. And for some H.B.C.U.s, applications are way up. But if you reach the point where you think that a category of institutions are the right choice for you \u2014 going to an H.B.C.U. just to go to an H.B.C.U. \u2014 then you\u2019re not thinking broadly enough.\n\nM.J.: As you look across the landscape of higher education, what other challenges do college students face today?\n\nR.S.: I guess I worry a lot about our students having the skills and the experience to promote respectful interactions with a wide-ranging group of people. Students can be quite passionate about what they see on the national scene and how sometimes dangerous they think it is \u2014 how unpleasant it is and so forth. But we\u2019ve got to try to find a way on our campuses not to taint the national picture as hopeless, or as being antithetical to anything that we can think of as good and admirable. The last thing we want is for our students to bow out and decide that it isn\u2019t worth trying to do anything about a hopeless situation.\n\nAnd I do think that civility goes hand in hand with being hopeful. Hopeful that the next person you meet you will be able to converse with you in a respectful way. Hopeful that the next election cycle is going to give you a chance to be engaged and able to do something that makes you feel a sense of your own agency. Hopeful that the things will get better rather than worse.\n\nSo much of what we have to do on our campuses is really to hold open the possibility for people that civil society will in the end right itself \u2014 if enough of us are engaged. I am so thankful every day for the fact that I grew up in a time when nobody thought blacks would be able to be integrated into American society, they would never be able to hold important positions, they\u2019d never be respected intellectually, they\u2019d never be able to do the things that they are now able to do. So why did we persist? And why did we continue to work toward betterment? We did it because we had people working with us in education who were ever hopeful that things were going to change. So I like to say to educators, you have to be always projecting to students that civility enables hopefulness to be ever resurgent.", "keywords": ["prairie", "simmons", "today", "generation", "think", "view", "cultivating", "dont", "ruth", "things", "say", "leadership", "able", "college", "students"], "polarity": 0.18839701321015756, "subjectivity": 0.47766767453623127},

They are quiet, almost too much so. But once you learn what happened in these scenes from small towns, big cities or verdant fields, their almost unemotional first impression gives way to horror: Someone was lynched there.\n\nStarting in 2016, Mr. Clasper traveled through the United States seeking the sites of lynchings. He wanted to show how places that call no attention to themselves were the sites of hangings, slashings or execution by gunfire. In the course of covering 24 sites, they span 150 years, right up to the present century, and range from the American south to New York City.\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective, I take it back to 1903, when the American scholar and activist W.E.B. Du Bois said the problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line,\u201d Mr. Clasper said. \u201cIt seems to me not a lot has changed despite significant advances. There has been barely a year or generation that has passed where racism and violence have not been at the forefront of the American experience.\u201d\n\nAs the London-born son of a British mother and American father, Mr. Clasper said he had \u201ca deep spiritual connection to the American landscape.\u201d In this series \u2014 titled \u201cThe Spaces We Inherit\u201d \u2014 he hopes to gently confront viewers in a way that eschews graphic images of violence.\n\n\u201cI took a different approach and focused on the spaces to encourage people to look at this history from an altered perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve become desensitized to images of violence.

Jesse Lee Bond had asked for an invoice the day before after purchasing goods on credit, something that was no\u0095t done by African-Americans at that time as keeping sharecroppers in the dark about how much they had spent was one way for white owners to keep their workers in constant debt. The day of Jesse Lee Bond\u2019s murder he was ordered back to the store. His aunt accompanied him and witnessed the whole thing. \u201cThey shot at him and shot him. He ran out to the outhouse. They riddled the outhouse. And when he staggered out of the outhouse, they threw him down, castrated him, and dragged him to the river,\u0095\u201d she said. The family was told he had drowned accidentally.\n\nImage\n\nSylvester Lewis, Memphis\n\n\u201cI remember my cousin Jesse well. I was 9 when he was killed and he was 20. What I heard was that there had been a dispute at the SY Wilson general store over in Arlington. Jesse insisted on a receipt, but this is something they didn\u2019\u0095t do. I think whoever he was negotiating with relented, but I think the people over him, the father of the individual in question, didn\u2019\u0095t like it. They went to his home and said they wanted to talk to him and ordered him back to the store. When he returned they attacked him. He tried to run for his life but they caught up with him and shot him. I also heard that they dragged his body behind a vehicle and then dumped him in the river. The descendants are running the store now, and I\u2019\u0095m not sure they know what happened. The ones who were allegedly involved in the lynching passed a long time ago, but their relations are still in Arlington. I don\u2019t think there\u2019\u0095s any resentment now. Anyone who hears about it can\u2019\u0095t understand how that could happen. They simply can\u2019t relate to that kind of criminal activity.\u201d\n\nInterviewed November 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Emmett Till, Drew, Miss., 1955.\n\nIn what is one of the most significant race-related events in the history of the United States, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Chicago native, was brutally lynched in rural Mississippi on Aug. 28, 1955. Till, who had been visiting family members in the area, entered a local white-owned grocery store in the town of Money for less than one minute. Whatever was said between him and the proprietor, Carolyn Bryant, was used as the pretext for his murder. Four days later Till was abducted from his uncle\u2019\u0095s house by Roy Bryant, Carolyn\u2019\u0095s husband, and J.W. Milam and driven to a nearby barn where he was severely beaten and tortured (the original wall of the barn can be seen on the left of the photograph). He was then taken to the Tallahatchie River, shot in the head, and drowned with a cotton gin fan tied around his neck. In an infamous court case both defendants were found \u0094not guilty\u0095 by an all-white jury. Months later they sold their story and admitted their guilt, with Bryant claiming that the Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education that desegregated schools was a mistake. Emmett Till\u2019s mother, Mamie Till Bradley, allowed photos to be taken of her son\u2019s broken and swollen body because she \u201cwanted the world to see what they did to my baby.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nDr. Jeffrey Andrews, Drew, Miss.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know the history of the property when I purchased it in 2003 and it was only two years later that a few local people told me of the Emmett Till murder. I\u2019ve lived in Drew since I was 12 and I had never heard of it. I\u2019ve since modified the barn to make it more functional and useful, and someone once asked me why I would change a historical site, but history is in the past and people should move on. Things have changed drastically here in the Mississippi Delta region and race relations are at all-time high. History is an important learning tool and it should be used to help people move forward, but one thing you have to remember is that people here don\u2019t want to be constantly reminded of how things were 60 years ago. We\u2019ve all moved forward, and sometimes people aren\u2019t given enough credit for the changes we\u2019ve made. I respect everyone\u2019s feelings towards Emmett Till, and I\u2019ve met some of his family members. They\u2019re great people. This has been a learning experience for my family and we appreciate the fact that we\u2019re part of a historical site.\u201d\n\nInterviewed March 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Joe Coe, Omaha, 1891\n\nOn Oct. 10, 1891, a 50-year-old African-American named Joe Coe (also known as George Smith) was accused of sexually assaulting a 5-year-old girl and was quickly arrested. Rumors spread that the girl had died and that Coe would get off lightly, neither of which was true. A frenzied mob seized him from the jail at the Douglas County Courthouse, put a rope around his neck, and dragged his body through the streets. Coe was then hanged from a streetcar wire on the corner of 17th and Harney in front of thousands of onlookers. Souvenirs of the rope were later sold. Mayor Richard C. Cushing of Omaha condemned the lynching as \u201c\u0094the most deplorable thing that has ever happened in the history of the country.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Ell Persons, Memphis, 1917\n\nWhen the decapitated body of a 16-year-old local, Antoinette Rappel, was found near the old Wolf River Bridge in May 1917, Ell Persons, a local black woodcutter, was deemed a possible suspect. Despite being arrested and released twice, he was captured a third time and forced to confess. A local mob announced that he was to be lynched the next day. The news spread, and a crowd of 3,000 turned up to witness his lynching (including students of Central High School). Ell Persons was burned on a makeshift pyre in a carnival-like atmosphere. He was then decapitated, and his head was taken to the predominantly African-American Beale Street and thrown at locals. A century later his lynching was commemorated and a historic marker was erected near the site.\n\nImage\n\nAmal Altareb, Memphis\n\n\u201cI came to America in 2012 from Yemen. I\u2019m still learning the language and the history, and it wasn\u2019t until the spring of last year that I learned about lynchings. I knew some of the history of segregation and Jim Crow laws, and I knew how unfair the system was \u2014 that African-Americans weren\u2019t treated as equals \u2014 but I didn\u2019t know that human beings had been burned or hanged from a tree just because of their race. Last year my class at Central High School were discussing it and I asked what lynchings were and they were surprised that I didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s surprising that humans can go so far as to kill someone else in this way and create a festival-like atmosphere. There were even spectators. Uncovering the truth is painful, but it\u2019s important. The African-American students especially don\u2019t talk about it because it\u2019s painful, and it reminds them of the injustices towards their race. White Americans don\u2019t want to remember either because of the guilt they feel. I can understand why people want to avoid the topic, but we need to face history in order to move forward.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Leo Frank, Marietta, Ga., 1915\n\nMary Phagan, 13, was found dead on April 26, 1913, at a National Pencil Company factory where she worked. Amid an atmosphere of anti-Semitism and despite conflicting evidence, a Jewish superintendent named Leo Frank was convicted of the crime. Frank\u2019s sentence was later commuted from the death penalty to life imprisonment, a decision that led a mob on Aug. 17, 1915, to seize him from state prison and lynch him from a tree in Marietta, Mary Phagan\u2019s hometown. Later that year the second chapter of the Ku Klux Klan was founded on Stone Mountain, with a number of Leo Frank\u2019s murderers present. Leo Frank was posthumously pardoned in 1986.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of George W. Murray, Mae Murray Dorsey, Roger Malcom and Dorothy Malcolm, Walton County, Georgia, 1946\n\nAfter Roger Malcom, a World War II veteran and Georgia sharecropper, had been bailed out of jail after allegedly stabbing a white man, members of the local community decided to take revenge. On July 25, 1946, a mob of 15 to 20 stopped the car Malcom was riding in with his wife, Dorothy, and another couple, George W. Murray and Mae Murray Dorsey, who was pregnant. They tied the four of them to a nearby tree and shot them to death. Mae Murray Dorsey then had her unborn baby ripped out of her. Despite an F.B.I. investigation nobody was brought to trial for the crime, and a few months later a grand jury was \u201cunable to establish the identity of any persons guilty of violating the civil rights statute of the United States.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nCeleste Butler, Omaha\n\n\u201cTracing one\u2019s roots and one\u2019s history is hard, especially as an African-American. These are big questions we all want to know: Who are we and where do we come from? I had DNA testing done recently but it didn\u2019t lead anywhere. It just told me that my ancestors came from West Africa, but it couldn\u2019t say where exactly. Missing that part and not being able to hand it down to my children or grandchildren is frustrating. On top of that you hear some people in this country telling black people to \u2018go back home.\u2019 Home to what? Home to whom? It feels like a total assault both mentally and physically to have chapters and generations missing. Not being able to fill that void is difficult. When it comes to racial violence I feel like we\u2019re constantly suffering from PTSD. It\u2019s a stress that never really goes away. A lot of people suffer in pain and in silence, and they suffer for successive generations. Everything was stripped from us, and we\u2019ve been struggling to put the pieces back together ever since.\u201d\n\nInterviewed September 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Michael Donald, Mobile, Ala., 1981\n\nMichael Donald, 19, was abducted on March 21, 1981, by Henry Hays and James Knowles as he was walking home. They beat him, slit his throat, and hanged his body from a tree outside 114 Herndon Avenue. The pretext for Donald\u2019s murder was a \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict handed down by a partially black jury to an African-American man accused of killing a white police officer. This incensed the Alabama chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, led by Benny Jack Hays, the father of Henry Hays, who suggested killing a random black person in response. Michael Donald\u2019s mother, Beulah Mae Donald, with the help of the Southern Poverty Law Center, brought a case not just against the killers but also the United Klans of America. Beulah Mae Donald won the case and received $7 million in damages, essentially bankrupting the U.K.A. Henry Hays was executed, while Knowles received life imprisonment. Hays is the only known Klan member to have been executed in the 20th century for the murder of an African-American. Herndon Avenue has since been renamed Michael Donald Avenue and a historic marker has been erected.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Mulugeta Seraw, Portland, Ore., 1988\n\nOn the evening of Nov. 13, 1988, an Ethiopian student named Mulugeta Seraw was being dropped off at his apartment when he was attacked by Kenneth Mieske, Kyle Brewster and Steve Strasser, members of a local racist skinhead group called East Side White Pride. Mieske delivered the fatal blows with a baseball bat. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 1990 Seraw\u2019s family, represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, brought a civil lawsuit against the killers\u2019 affiliated group, the White Aryan Nation, and its leaders, Tom and John Metzger, for $12.5 million. Tom Metzger later said that the killers had done their \u201ccivic duty\u201d by killing Seraw.\n\nImage\n\nJason Downard, Portland, Ore.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 2 I was put into foster care, and in 2009 I went to prison for a gang-affiliated drive-by shooting. I didn\u2019t grow up racist, but in prison the racist skinheads pulled me into their group and drilled stuff into my head about how the media is run by Jews and that they wanted an all-white nation. I also got a tattoo of a swastika on my leg, which I\u2019ve since had covered up. It\u2019s a painful reminder. The skinheads showed me support and love and compassion, which I hadn\u2019t experienced before in my life; everyone is looking for some kind of acceptance. I was angry and uncomfortable with who I was, and I drove that anger towards people who didn\u2019t look like me. In the last two years of the movement my sister had a son with a black guy and my nephew would give me this look like he knew what I was about. I started to get a guilty conscience and began to think about the things I thought I believed in. My sister said I\u2019d been brainwashed, and I can see why. The movement just taught me to hate and reinforced those views. The problem of racism in this country is much deeper than many people think. When it comes to Trump, he\u2019s tacitly endorsed the alt-right and white supremacists. It\u2019s been a ripple effect and things have gotten worse since he came into power. The right now feel emboldened. I look back now at some of the things I\u2019ve done and I realize that I\u2019ve hurt a lot of people. I decided I wanted to help others who had been in a similar position to me, and that\u2019s been my mission ever since. Now I work for an organization called Life After Hate. I\u2019m a marked man, and maybe I\u2019ll die doing this, but at least I\u2019ll die knowing I did the right thing.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Murder Site of Timothy Caughman, New York City, 2017\n\nOn March 17, 2017 James Harris Jackson traveled from his home in Baltimore to New York City with the intention of killing random black men. The reason, he later told police, was his hatred of interracial relationships. Three days later he found Timothy Caughman, 66, collecting cans in a trash bin on the corner of West 36th and 9th Avenue and stabbed him multiple times with an 18-inch sword. Caughman died of his injuries that night, and two days later Jackson turned himself in, telling police that he had planned to kill more black men in Times Square. On March 27, Jackson was charged with one count each of murder in the first and second degrees as an act of terrorism, second-degree murder as a hate crime, and three counts of criminal possession of a weapon.\n\n\u201cThe Spaces We Inherit,\u201d which will be published as a book by Overlapse in October 2018, is available for pre-order.\n\nFollow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

Trump Jr. about a 2016 meeting with Russian officials has drawn attention from federal investigators. On Tuesday, she testified for eight hours before the House Intelligence Committee and made headlines for admitting that she had sometimes told fibs as part of her job.\n\nLast month, the man she had been dating, the former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, was accused by his former wives of domestic abuse, sparking an ongoing scandal that offered a glimpse of her closely guarded personal life and drew paparazzi to her apartment building. There were rumblings that Mr. Trump questioned Ms. Hicks\u2019s judgment after the White House initially defended Mr. Porter, although a bevy of administration officials, including the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, later vouched for Ms. Hicks in on-the-record interviews.\n\nMs. Hicks had stopped monitoring news coverage of herself, restricting her television intake to Fox News, which she often watched on mute, assuming that the Trump-friendly network would rarely include her name on its chyrons.\n\nFriends who reached out to her, offering support or guidance, acknowledged that Ms. Hicks had been distressed. But they also received text messages from her in which she declared that she was tougher than people assumed.\n\nMs. Hicks\u2019s career followed a curious trajectory. As a young model, she appeared on the covers of young adult paperbacks and in Ralph Lauren catalogs before going to work for Ms. Trump\u2019s apparel and licensing brand. Even after she had begun serving as an Oval Office gatekeeper, she maintained a low public profile, which fueled the fascination \u2014 and sometimes disdain \u2014 of those who watch national politics closely.\n\nVideo\n\nEmily Nussbaum, The New Yorker\u2019s television critic, often tweeted whimsically about Ms. Hicks, calling her an \u201cIt Girl.\u201d (Ms. Hicks was once the face of a \u201cGossip Girl\u201d-spinoff book series called \u201cIt Girl.\u201d) Others dismissed her as a mere factotum, especially after a report that she was once tasked during the campaign with steaming Mr. Trump\u2019s suits, sometimes while he was wearing them. On Wednesday, after news of Ms. Hicks\u2019s exit was announced, the New Yorker writer Jia Tolentino tweeted: \u201cGoodbye to Hope Hicks, an object lesson in the quickest way a woman can advance under misogyny: silence, beauty, and unconditional deference to men.\u201d\n\nIn Washington, however, Ms. Hicks\u2019s success was viewed as a product of other qualities, including her nuanced understanding of Mr. Trump\u2019s moods, her ability to subtly nudge him away from his coarser impulses and her skill as a liaison for some of the most prominent journalists in the country.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhen she tells you something, you know she is speaking to the president, because she is with him all the time,\u201d said Steve Scully, the senior executive producer at C-Span and coordinator of the network\u2019s White House coverage. \u201cIt was amazing how often he would turn to Hope and ask her questions and ask her point of view.

Often, she could single-handedly arrange time with the easily distracted president. At a Paley Center panel discussion on Wednesday, the NBC News anchor Lester Holt described Ms. Hicks as his first contact for coordinating his interview with Mr. Trump last May. \u201cShe was quite helpful,\u201d Mr. Holt said.\n\nAnd in an administration riven by infighting, Ms. Hicks\u2019s privileged position with the president meant that, for journalists, she was among the few officials whose information was deemed reliable, or at least not often compromised by personal squabbles.\n\nOf course, she always advocated for her boss, lamenting that reporters did not see the empathetic and charming Mr. Trump whom she said she knew.\n\nMs. Hicks, a reluctant \u00e9migr\u00e9 to insular Washington, kept a tiny circle of confidants, complaining that she could not trust anyone in a company town. She frequently visited family in Connecticut and friends in New York, where she felt she could comfortably walk down the street without being accosted or asked for a favor.\n\nShe has told friends that, for now, she has no definite ideas for her life after the West Wing, except that she will not be living in Washington. An extended vacation with her family is planned. Book agents have come calling, but Ms. Hicks has told acquaintances that she is reluctant to write anything \u2014 although she has joked that a massive advance could change her mind.\n\n\u201cI think she would benefit from taking a minute or two to get some perspective on all of this,\u201d said Michael Feldman, a Clinton White House veteran who is a family friend of Ms. Hicks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t worry about Hope,\u201d Mr. Feldman added, echoing other friends interviewed for this article. \u201cI fully expect her to land on her feet.\u201d\n\nThose confident in Ms. Hicks\u2019s future prospects sounded more concerned about Mr. Trump and his ability to work without an aide he has relied on nearly every day for three years.\n\n\u201cThis is not losing a staffer,\u201d Mr. Feldman said. \u201cThis is like losing a limb.\u201d", "keywords": ["mr", "limb", "white", "washington", "losing", "ms", "hope", "departure", "hicks", "trump", "trumps", "house", "hickss", "york"], "polarity": 0.073113106511544, "subjectivity": 0.3874954906204906},

Though his inquiry is intensely, at times painfully personal, Mr. Wilkerson is above all concerned with unpacking the mechanisms of racial domination. The procedure is akin to performing surgery on a half-conscious subject, or digging up a buried land mine that has lost little of its explosive power.\n\nVideo\n\nThe focus of his excavation is a killing that took place in Dothan, Ala., in 1946, when S.E. Branch, a white shopkeeper, shot Bill Spann, a black man who was in his store. Branch, Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s great-grandfather, was charged with first-degree murder, but no trial was ever held, and the crime faded from memory. Or rather, the memory of it was quietly and systematically suppressed. All that remains are a short newspaper article and a few photographs and home movies of the killer.\n\n\u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d proceeds on several parallel tracks. Mr. Wilkerson returns to Alabama and tries to discover both how Bill Spann died and how he was forgotten. His investigation, accompanied by haunting images of Southern back roads and quiet houses, is punctuated by reminders that Bill Spann\u2019s death is hardly a unique or anomalous event. The names of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and other recent victims of racist violence appear onscreen, and two songs of protest loop into the soundtrack: Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s \u201cHell You Talmbout\u201d and Phil Ochs\u2019s \u201cWilliam Moore.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat song, about a white postal worker and civil rights activist murdered on an Alabama highway in 1963, is the source of the film\u2019s title and a part of its wider cultural context. \u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d is a passionately political film, aflame with rage in spite of its director\u2019s measured, ruminative tone of voice. It is also a horror movie, full of specters and silences and a terror that is pervasive, intimate and elusive.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Wilkerson, whose previous films include \u201cAn Injury to One\u201d and \u201cFar From Afghanistan,\u201d dispenses with many of the usual techniques of historical documentary. There are a few on-camera interviews, with neighbors and relatives, but more frequently Mr. Wilkerson narrates encounters that took place off camera. And his sleuthing often leads not to moments of revelation but to dead ends and deeper mysteries. The insertion of clips from \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d provides a chilling and ironic counterpoint to the grim story this movie is telling. S.E. Branch is the opposite of Gregory Peck\u2019s brave and decent Atticus Finch, and the truth about what happened to Bill Spann resists the kind of redemptive, healing conclusion that remains a cornerstone of American racial fantasy.\n\nInstead of consolation, Mr. Wilkerson offers commitment. Instead of idealism, honesty. He doesn\u2019t suppose that his film will solve anything, but there is nonetheless something profoundly useful about the way he confronts past and present manifestations of white supremacy. He links his great-grandfather\u2019s crime to the contemporaneous gang rape of Recy Taylor (the subject of an excellent recent documentary by Nancy Buirski), and uncovers patterns of abuse within his family. He corresponds with a relative who is part of a white nationalist, \u201cSouthern secessionist\u201d group. He notes the way racial injustice dwells in apparently mundane facts. The killer is immortalized in pictures and a well-kept tombstone. His victim has been almost entirely erased from memory, a kind of second death beyond the reach of redress or revenge.", "keywords": ["mr", "white", "reckons", "gun", "fired", "racial", "movie", "bill", "wonder", "spann", "wilkerson", "review", "memory", "supremacy"], "polarity": 0.04540441176470589, "subjectivity": 0.3202205882352941},

The president insisted that he personally would charge into a school, even unarmed, to challenge a gunman. Frank Brogan, a former Florida lieutenant governor who has been nominated for assistant secretary of elementary and secondary education, carries an unusual credential: When he was an assistant principal, Mr. Brogan chased down an armed teenager, talked him into lowering his weapon, then grabbed his arm and wrestled it away.\n\nBut even many educators who have faced off with a school gunman oppose the president\u2019s idea.\n\nEvery day for five and a half years, Jesse Wasmer said, he has thought about the moment that he tackled a student who had just fired a shotgun into the back of a classmate in the cafeteria of a suburban Baltimore high school.\n\n\u201cNever have I thought, \u2018I wish I\u2019d had a gun,\u2019\u201d Mr. Wasmer said.\n\nMr. Wasmer, who was a guidance counselor at Perry Hall High School when a student opened fire there in 2012, called the president\u2019s assertions \u201csimplistic and misguided.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think as educators we\u2019re trained to nurture kids and foster kids, and our first instinct is to not shoot or harm them,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we need is more caring adults in these kids\u2019 lives, not more guns.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nOfficials here in this town of 20,000 do not swagger.\n\n\u201cI agree with those folks who say teachers should teach and cops should be cops, but we got a mess on our hands,\u201d said Sheriff John Lenhart of Shelby County, who gave up his National Rifle Association membership in the 1990s. \u201cIf I have to wait on state officials, on the federal government, on psychologists to figure out why people hurt one another, we would have nothing in our school system.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSince 2013, in response to the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., legislation in state capitals across the country has sought to arm school staff. At least 10 states allow staff members to possess or have access to a firearm on school grounds, according to an analysis by the Education Commission of the States. And local districts have varied their approach to arming educators \u2014 in Ohio, guns are kept in safes; in Texas, they can be worn in holsters or kept in safes within immediate reach.\n\nA Florida state legislative committee approved a $67 million \u201cschool marshal\u201d program this week to train and arm teachers \u2014 over the vocal opposition of Parkland residents.\n\nIn Texas, some public school systems have been quietly arming teachers and administrators for more than a decade. Teachers and other school personnel who volunteer to undergo specialized training receive approval to either carry a concealed firearm in school or have one within reach.\n\nPhoto\n\nLawmakers, educators and advocates for gun rights said Texas\u2019 school marshal and school guardian programs have eased fears of armed intruders and have not led to any firearm accidents or mishaps. The state\u2019s programs could serve as a model for schools around the country, advocates say.\n\nOne rural district, Harrold Independent School District, has been allowing armed personnel to carry concealed firearms on school grounds as part of its guardian program since 2007, one year after a shooting at an Amish school in Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cThis clearly is the solution to the problem that we\u2019re seeing around the country, and I think the president has recognized that,\u201d said State Representative Jason Villalba, a Dallas Republican who wrote the law that established the school-marshal program.\n\nAt a meeting at the White House with other governors on Monday, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, told Mr. Trump that in more than 100 school districts in Texas, teachers and other personnel carry a weapon and are trained to respond to an attack.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cCandidly, some school districts, they promote it,\u201d the governor told the president. \u201cBecause they will have signs out front \u2014 a warning sign: \u2018Be aware, there are armed personnel on campus\u2019 \u2014 warning anybody coming on there that they \u2014 if they attempt to cause any harm, they\u2019re going to be in trouble.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Ohio, which allows local school boards to decide who can possess or have access to firearms on school grounds, Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, also supports arming teachers.\n\nOhio\u2019s teachers\u2019 unions have mobilized against the widespread arming of teachers in schools, arguing that gun control, not armed clashes, will protect students.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate that there are teachers that are willing to take this extra step. It comes from a good place,\u201d said Melissa Cropper, the president of the Ohio Federation of Teachers. \u201cBut when you start thinking about all that could go wrong in that situation, there are too many risks involved.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nLike many districts, Sidney City Schools was shaken by the slaughter of 20 first graders and six staff members at Sandy Hook in 2012. In the following days, Sheriff Lenhart presented Mr. Scheu with an equation: Every 17 seconds after the first shots are fired and the first 911 call is made, somebody gets hurt or dies.\n\n\u201cEven in the best-case scenario, we could get here in four to five minutes,\u201d Sheriff Lenhart said. \u201cYou do the math.\u201d\n\nWithin a year, Sheriff Lenhart had led what he calls a \u201clayered\u201d approach to school security and a \u201cconservative\u201d approach to arming teachers in the 3,400-student school district.\n\nThe district spent about $70,000 on safes, bulletproof vests, cameras, guns, radios and ammunition. Uniformed, armed officers cost $200,000 a year, and an insurance policy of $100,000 a year includes coverage for its staff with access to firearms. Those are negligible costs for a school district with a $36 million budget, the superintendent said.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re buying time, and it\u2019s of the essence,\u201d Mr. Scheu said.\n\nWindows and doors are numbered in the district\u2019s schools, and visitors have to be buzzed in. Each school has a panic button and security camera system that feeds to the sheriff\u2019s office. Every school has a uniformed, armed guard, mostly retired sheriff\u2019s deputies, every day from bell to bell. The high school has a specially trained officer and a bulletproof window between the secretary and visitors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd if all else fails, there\u2019s a secret group of 40 educators \u2014 teachers, principals, custodians, secretaries \u2014 called a \u201cfirst responder team\u201d that can retrieve firearms in under a minute.\n\nThe team was vetted by Mr. Scheu and Sheriff Lenhart, and completed a 16-hour training course that includes firearm safety, unarmed defensive tactics and basic gunshot first aid. Its members are required to attend a concealed weapons course, as well as additional monthly trainings at either the firing range where they practice marksmanship and in school-based simulations where they practice in the hallways, identifying threats and eliminating them with air guns.\n\nSince the team was created, it has responded to one incident, this past August when a student brought a gun to school in his backpack. It did not require a member to retrieve a gun.\n\nThe measures here met some opposition at first, from the town\u2019s teachers union and police chief, who were concerned about gun safety.\n\nBut Rick Cron, the armed guard at Sidney Middle School, said he would put members of his team up against any law enforcement officer in Ohio. The state requires that officers fire 25 bullets a year; his team members shoot at least 600.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the teacher\u2019s responsibility to protect the kids, no matter what, and they do it already,\u201d Mr. Cron said, \u201cbut without the tools.\u201d\n\nNicki New, the parent of three students in Sidney City Schools, said she felt safer dropping off her children knowing there were staff members equipped to respond to a parent\u2019s worst nightmare.\n\n\u201cGod forbid, if something would happen, knowing that not only a law enforcement officer is there, but there are teachers in that building who can give my child a fighting chance, is even more reassuring,\u201d Ms. New said.", "keywords": ["mr", "armed", "members", "texas", "teachers", "wants", "arm", "trump", "team", "state", "educators", "schools", "school"], "polarity": 0.07691177649510983, "subjectivity": 0.37541506333172986},

But it\u2019s also a powerful place, and a friendly one for travelers. Image Scenes from Montgomery. Clockwise from top right: Students examine the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Civil Rights Memorial, designed by Maya Lin; a Nat King Cole mural on Maxwell Boulevard near downtown, by the artists Sunny Paulk and Corey Spearman; culinary students Sheldon Warren, Steven McIntyre and Felicia Houston hang out at Aviator Bar after work; the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church, where Dr. King preached. Credit Jada Yuan/The New York Times\n\nDriving by the Alabama State Capitol building in Montgomery, Michelle Browder, an African-American activist and founder of the I Am More Than... youth mentorship nonprofit, pointed out a looming bronze statue of Jefferson Davis, the first and only president of the Confederacy. It has a position of prominence right out front, as does a commemorative plaque on the marble steps marking the exact spot where he stood taking his oath of office in 1861. A state holiday recognizes his birthday. Farther down the Capitol lawn, Ms. Browder said, was a similar statue heralding Dr. J. Marion Sims, but I didn\u2019t recognize the name, and she wouldn\u2019t elaborate. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to do your homework on that one,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause my blood pressure goes up when I talk about him.\u201d\n\nMs. Browder wore red cat-eye glasses, an Army-green jacket, and a T-shirt bearing the words \u201cDream Destroyed\u201d and the face of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who began leading the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955 from the basement of a Baptist church just 440 feet from those Capitol steps. The vehicle she was careening through downtown, often parking akimbo on sidewalks or in the middle of the street, was a six-seat electric cart, from which she leads More Than Tours \u2014 explorations of a city that has been both the site of systemic oppression of her fellow African-Americans and the birthplace of the civil rights movement.\n\nWithin about 10 seconds, she\u2019d risked that blood pressure spike to tell me about Sims. \u201cHe\u2019s known as the father of modern gynecology,\u201d she said. \u201cHe enslaved black women and he used them as experiments.\u201d Specifically, he visited unimaginable tortures on 12 slave women, without anesthesia, under the belief that black people felt less than whites. \u201cWe are starting an initiative,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause we would like to see the mothers of gynecology erected beside him to give more to the story.\u201d The \u201cwe\u201d she refers to is a group she\u2019s organized called Friends of Anarcha, after a woman who endured 30 of Sims\u2019s vaginal surgeries before he declared her a success.\n\nMontgomery was my third stop on an insane yearlong mission I\u2019ve undertaken to visit every spot on The Times\u2019 52 Places to Go in 2018 list, and I was eager to find out why the city had snagged the No. 49 slot. By the end of four days, I\u2019d come to believe it should have ranked higher. As a tourist destination, Montgomery is \u2014 how shall I put this \u2014 heavy. In the same afternoon, visitors can see the Rosa Parks Museum, built at the site of her 1955 arrest for refusing to give up her seat to a white person, and the first White House of the Confederacy, a National Historic Landmark. (Ms. Browder is a descendant of Aurelia Browder, a woman who faced a similar arrest eight months before Parks, and who was the lead plaintiff in the 1956 lawsuit, Browder v. Gayle, that ended the bus boycott.)\n\nThe city is also undeniably relevant right now, with a deep commitment to confronting its past (and often present) of racism, at a time when white supremacism has re-entered the national conversation in a major way. Daily, I found myself moved to tears by any number of tales of brutality or hardship, and the strength it took to tell them. Even the trees that line the streets, dripping with Spanish moss like bearded old men, seem embedded with pain.\n\nI\u2019d arrived in MGM, as residents call it, less than two months after national news outlets had swarmed its streets to document the contentious Senate race in which Doug Jones, a Democrat, defeated Roy S. Moore, the Republican who had been accused of harassing and assaulting teenage girls. \u201cHis office is right there!\u201d Ms. Browder said, pointing to the windows of Mr. Moore\u2019s Foundation for Moral Law, in a building that once housed the bank that funded the Confederacy.\n\nImage A rendering of the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, scheduled to open on April 26. Credit Equal Justice Initiative\n\nWhat really ought to bump Montgomery up the 52 Places list is the National Memorial for Peace and Justice that the Equal Justice Initiative, a human rights legal nonprofit, is scheduled to open on April 26. Inspired by the memorials that Germany, Rwanda and South Africa have built to the atrocities of their own pasts, it pays tribute to the approximately 4,400 black victims of lynching by white mobs in the United States from 1877 to 1950, and is the country\u2019s first comprehensive memorial to racial terrorism.\n\nThe six-acre site and an accompanying museum that aims to link slavery to mass incarceration were under construction when I visited, but plans show it will consist of 800 rectangular, oxidized steel columns, each representing a particular county in the Deep South and Midwest, and bearing the names of the men, women and children killed there. While the columns will appear at first glance to touch the ground, the floor of the memorial will actually slope downward as visitors walk through it, allowing for the columns to hang over them, like bodies.\n\nThe Initiative\u2019s project is in many ways a companion piece to the work that the Southern Poverty Law Center, the nation\u2019s top legal advocate for victims of hate crimes, began in Montgomery with the Civil Rights Memorial in 1989. The memorial, designed by Maya Lin, consists of a stone table overflowing with water, bearing the names of 40 people who were murdered while doing things as simple as registering black people to vote. (A Civil Rights Memorial Center was added in 2005.)\n\nUpon first impression, even with a county population of 230,000, Montgomery seems far too quaint and conservative to be home to two of the country\u2019s most influential, progressive nonprofits fighting racial bias. Its airport has a single baggage claim and the rental car area is dotted with wooden rocking chairs, for an extra dose of Southern charm. I spent 20 minutes answering emails before walking outside and found myself the only person left on the premises, other than three bored-seeming policemen trading stories on the sidewalk.\n\n\u201cYou need a taxi, ma\u2019am?\u201d one of them asked. \u201cHe just left, so it\u2019s going to be 15 or 20 minutes.\u201d \u201cNow, where\u2019s my taxi driver?\u201d the officer mumbled to himself, then got on the radio: \u201cNick, there\u2019s a lady waiting for you.\u201d It took me a minute to absorb what I was hearing, but yes, apparently there was only one taxi driver working in Montgomery on Super Bowl Sunday.\n\nI\u2019d encountered a similar peculiarity earlier that morning, when I\u2019d made a last minute online reservation at a lovely bed-and-breakfast, Red Bluff Cottage, only to receive a distressed call from the owner, Bonnie Ponstein, wondering what time, exactly, I was planning to arrive. She, her husband and their usual housekeeper would all be at church.\n\nThat evening, I went to the city\u2019s historic downtown for an informal tour with an enterprising Lyft driver, Marcus McNeal. We stood talking in the middle of those cobblestone streets for what must have been 30 minutes before another car, or even another person, came by. \u201cYou could shoot a cannon down Dexter Avenue\u201d \u2014 downtown\u2019s main drag \u2014 \u201cand not hit a person on a Sunday,\u201d Barry Ponstein, Bonnie\u2019s husband told me later. \u201cEveryone\u2019s at church.\u201d\n\nThe one person we did meet out and about, actually, was Brother Ricky Segers, whom we found deep into a nightly ritual he\u2019s kept up for three years, of kneeling in front of a tiny souvenir American flag he\u2019s planted on the Capitol grounds to ask Jesus for more \u201cgodly\u201d leaders in this country. He feels as though Roy Moore was \u201cmistreated\u201d and Robert E. Lee was a hero. Still, he and Mr. McNeal, the Lyft driver, who is black and at least half his age, have known each other for a while now and seem to get along great.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to me, too,\u201d said Mr. McNeal of their friendliness. He\u2019s 24, hopes to open a chain of 24-hour coffee shops for workaholics, and comes from what he described as abject poverty. The car he drove me in belongs to his mother, who has been pulling double shifts as a nurse\u2019s assistant to pay for their heating bill that had gone from $80 to $480 during a cold spell that preceded my visit.\n\n\u201cMy mom is 62 years old and she makes $8 an hour, and that\u2019s the most she\u2019s ever made,\u201d he said. Their all-wood house has too much dry rot for them to install insulation, and they haven\u2019t been able to afford replacing the bathroom sink that fell out of their wall. \u201cIt\u2019s O.K.,\u201d he said. \u201cPoverty is a mind-set. If you change your mind-set, you\u2019re going to come out of it eventually.\u201d Later, he declared, \u201cCome back and see me when I have my Bentley.\u201d\n\nThe ad hoc tour Mr. McNeal took me on had been refreshingly frank. He drove straight to a historical placard describing the bustling slave markets that had been held at Court Square, the city\u2019s central roundabout. I asked Mr. McNeal why it didn\u2019t have more central placement in the square and he just laughed: \u201cWhat else are they going to do? It\u2019s not like they can build an auction platform here. That would really piss some people off!\u201d\n\nWhen I mentioned to him that multiple people had suggested I eat at Central, an upscale Southern food restaurant in downtown\u2019s tiny revitalized commercial district, he joked, \u201cCentral is so expensive, you\u2019d be better off buying a restaurant and opening and stocking the kitchen yourself.\u201d We went to Applebee\u2019s instead, and gorged on spinach and artichoke dip.\n\nI did end up at Central on another night, and it was indeed quite good \u2014 part of a growing culinary scene that will include gourmet offerings at the renovated Kress on Dexter building downtown, which opens in April. The former block-wide department store, built in 1929, will host rotating pop-up markets devoted to local artists \u2014 and has been engaged in incredibly responsible historical preservation, which has included donating bricks made by enslaved people to EJI \u2014 as well as keep its old \u201cWhites Only\u201d and \u201cColored Only\u201d signs on display for posterity. I\u2019m also a fan of the coffee shops Prevail Union and Cafe Louisa, as well as bar standouts like Leroy Lounge, a dive with a terrific selection of wines and craft beers, and Aviator Bar, covered in airplane-themed kitsch \u2014 inspired by the Wright Brothers, who started the country\u2019s first civilian flight school outside Montgomery.\n\nI met a group of black culinary students there one night who not only knew the city\u2019s history but said it fueled their ambitions. \u201cWe\u2019re in a bar on the road that was used to bring people to be auctioned off,\u201d said Steven McIntyre, who interns as a line cook at the highly regarded restaurant Vintage Year, \u201cand the fact that we are here today, just hanging out, enjoying life, it\u2019s incredible. Not super long ago, we would not be chilling here. This would not be chill.\u201d\n\nMy best culinary experiences, though, came by way of cabdrivers I\u2019d met. Nick Alloway, that lone Sunday driver, sent me to Mrs. B\u2019s Home Cooking, a yellow-painted soul food restaurant a few minutes west of downtown that serves up a different featured meat every day. Blocks north of the Capitol building is Davis Cafe, an even older family-run soul food joint that\u2019s the haunt of Hillard Wright, a King\u2019s Airport shuttle driver with a salt-and-pepper mustache, a gruff baritone voice and a leather rancher\u2019s hat that never left his head. He spent a whole afternoon showing me his version of the city he\u2019s lived in all of his 66 years. State senators were crowded into every vinyl booth. My plate overflowing with collard greens, creamed corn, peas and okra, turkey dressing, yams and cornbread cost around $6.\n\nFollowing the spirit of the locals I had met, I tried to absorb as much history as I could in four days: The Dexter Parsonage Museum, where Dr. King lived in the 1950s; the F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald Museum in the home where their marriage dissolved; Hank Williams\u2019s grave in the Oakwood Annex Cemetery. What stuck with me more than any of those, though, were the three hours I spent with Mr. Wright, engaging in his favorite pastime of driving around and looking at old houses. He\u2019d introduce each neighborhood with factoids about its legal, and later, de facto, segregation status. Entering the \u201cold money\u201d neighborhood of Old Cloverdale, for example, he pointed out, \u201cif you\u2019ll notice, you don\u2019t see any black folks living in there.\u201d I did notice.\n\nMr. Wright, though, is not bitter. He has built for himself a quiet life of hunting and fishing, driving around for money and minding his own business. \u201cEven through the segregation and hatred,\u201d he said, \u201cMontgomery, I wouldn\u2019t trade it. I\u2019ve been here my whole life and I\u2019ve enjoyed every day.\u201d\n\nThis year, the city will erect its first statue to Dr. King, in front of the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church where he used to preach near the Capitol. The statues of J. Marion Sims and Jefferson Davis, erected in 1939 and 1940, will be in view, too. Alabama will remain one of two states that celebrate the King and Lee birthdays in a combined holiday. This is how change seems to come in Montgomery: messy and long overdue. Still, how wonderful to see progress in action.\n\nJada Yuan will be traveling to every place on this year\u2019s 52 Places to Go list. Her next dispatch will be from Disney Springs, Fla.

Governor Inslee, who has spent the past decade of his political career focusing on climate change, earning the sobriquet \u201cgreenest governor in America,\u201d sees the issue as a way to directly attack Mr. Trump, who has mocked established climate science, rolled back environmental regulations and promised to withdraw the United States from the landmark Paris climate accord.\n\nThis past Sunday, Governor Inslee said, he made his views clear at a governors\u2019 breakfast with Scott Pruitt, the head of Mr. Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency and the president\u2019s point man in undoing climate change rules. \u201cI told him, you\u2019re killing my state,\u201d Governor Inslee said of his conversation with Mr. Pruitt. \u201cMy state is going up in smoke because our forests are involved in these catastrophic fires.\u201d He added, \u201cI told him, this administration is not just irresponsible but morally reprehensible.\u201d\n\nAn E.P.A. official didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment from Mr. Pruitt.\n\nThe global interest in Governor Inslee\u2019s carbon tax push comes as several state leaders are signaling to the world that they intend to act on climate change with or without the Trump administration. More significantly, the state has drawn attention as a major global economy that is willing to buck conventional wisdom by taking on a carbon tax at all.\n\n\u201cThis is very significant. Washington is not just any state, it\u2019s home to so many global companies: Starbucks, Microsoft, Amazon,\u201d said Erik Solheim, the head of the United Nations Environment Program, speaking by phone from New Delhi, India. \u201cIt is part of the signal to the world that the major states, big business are in disagreement with the U.S. withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, and they are doing something about it.\u201d\n\nOpponents of climate change policy, including the fossil fuel industry and allies of the Trump administration, also see the potential for a Washington carbon tax as seminal. \u201cIf it works in the state of Washington, it\u2019s going to be tried in 10 states next year and 35 states the year after that,\u201d said Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist and political strategist who advised Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and transition. \u201cIf Inslee\u2019s successful, it will be a game-changer. Everyone will take it and copy it and be off and running.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlready, carbon tax bills have been introduced in the legislatures of Utah, Maryland, New York, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Vermont, Maine and Washington, D.C.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. McKenna said that he expects an effort to revive the carbon tax in a November ballot initiative vote to ignite a major campaign both for and against the effort.\n\nMr. McKenna is one of many analysts and strategists who see Governor Inslee\u2019s push to pass a carbon tax in his home state as his first step toward a national campaign. \u201cThis is not just about the state of Washington. This is about Jay positioning himself is a national leader on climate change,\u201d Mr. McKenna said. \u201cHe is testing out themes and strategies.\u201d\n\nEven if Governor Inslee\u2019s tax push makes him a hero in the eyes of environmental advocates around the world, Republicans see it as a political liability, and are preparing to attack him on it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of having votes on carbon taxes,\u201d said Thomas J. Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research, a think tank that supports fossil fuels and supplied the Trump administration with its energy policy blueprint, including rolling back climate change regulations and expanding coal and oil exploration. He recounted the history of politicians losing their jobs as a result of backing a price on carbon pollution.\n\nThere was Al Gore in 1993 when, as vice president, he urged Congress to pass an energy bill that would have taxed the heat content of burning fossil fuels. After Democrats pushed the bill through the House, Republicans attacked them for backing an energy tax, and the vote was seen as a key reason that Democrats lost control of the House in 1996.\n\nThe pattern was repeated in 2009, when President Barack Obama tried to push Congress to pass a so-called cap-and-trade bill, which would have required carbon polluters to pay for permits to pollute. The bill passed in the House but cost coal-state Democrats their seats.\n\nCarbon taxes have helped fell politicians around the world. In 2012, Prime Minister Julia Gillard of Australia successfully pushed to pass a carbon tax. The following year, she was ousted from office in a campaign that was partly seen as a referendum on the tax.\n\nAlthough Hillary Clinton campaigned in 2016 on a pledge to tackle climate change, she stopped short of endorsing a carbon tax. \u201cEven Obama recognized, even Hillary Clinton recognized, that a carbon tax is politically toxic,\u201d Mr. Pyle said. Governor Inslee, he said, is \u201cgoing to find out real quickly that it doesn\u2019t play in Peoria.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven some people who have voted for Governor Inslee express concern about how a carbon tax might be used against him in the hardball of a national political campaign. \u201cI would like to see him run,\u201d said Dan Rystrom, 56, a retired investor from a suburb of Seattle who identified himself as a Democrat. \u201cBut I think it would be the end of him,\u201d he said, describing the political ads he expected to see across the country, saying: \u201cWho is this man from the West Coast who just raised the prices of gasoline?\u201d\n\nStill, there are signs that other politicians might be willing to take the carbon tax plunge. In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is pushing to implement a national carbon tax by the end of the year. And while Washington would be the first state in the nation with a straight carbon tax, it is not the first to force polluters to pay for emitting carbon dioxide: As governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a cap-and-trade law in 2006.\n\nMany environmental economists say that in order for a carbon tax to significantly cut planet-warming pollution, it should be set at a rate of $30 to $50 per ton of pollution. The proposed Washington state tax is $12 a ton, although it would increase at $2 per year until it reaches $30.\n\nThe tax is also likely to have a smaller impact on Washington\u2019s economy than it might in other states, because of its unique energy mix. The state gets most of its electricity from carbon-free hydropower, rather than coal.\n\nIn the interview, Governor Inslee said that whoever ultimately runs against Mr. Trump in 2020 on the Democrat side should put climate change front and center in his or her campaign. The politics of global warming are changing, he said, as more Americans experiencing economically damaging weather events that scientists can attribute to the changing climate.\n\n\u201cClimate change used to be an abstraction. It used to be a graph,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we\u2019re seeing biblical events play out on the 6 o\u2019clock evening news.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe it is a successful and winning issue,\u201d Governor Inslee said.", "keywords": ["mr", "pursues", "win", "washington", "political", "climate", "governor", "change", "inslee", "tax", "energy", "carbon", "gamble", "state"], "polarity": 0.1556083797155226, "subjectivity": 0.4212456194599052},

Syria isn\u2019t so much a country as it is an exhibit for Dictatorship Inc., the main purpose of which is to show that resistance really is futile. That\u2019s why Russia doesn\u2019t shrink from bombing civilian hospitals, or Hezbollah from starving entire cities into submission, or Assad from using chemical weapons. They are showing their respective publics the lengths to which they are prepared to go to maintain their own grip on power.\n\nInterest No. 2: To underscore America\u2019s unreliability as a credible ally and serious enforcer of global norms.\n\nWhatever their differences, Iran, North Korea, Russia and China are all so-called revisionist powers. What they want to revise, or erase, is Pax Americana. In Syria, they had an ally, a cause and a plausible outcome. America, by contrast, only had the bonfire of its ambivalence. The result, beyond the humanitarian catastrophe, has been a reputational catastrophe, as the U.S. demonstrated that it would not back its local allies, or seriously enforce norms against the use of chemical weapons, or devise and implement a strategy compatible with our stated policy.\n\nWhatever else one might say about American regional interests or moral obligations when it comes to Syria, we have a vital national interest in foiling Dictatorship Inc.\u2019s ambitions for the country.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe could do something to reverse our reputation for unreliability by doing more to protect our Kurdish allies against their enemies \u2014 including the Turks \u2014 much as we did after the 1991 Persian Gulf war. We could erase the stain of the breached red line by striking Assad\u2019s military installations every time Syria uses chemical weapons. We could find covert ways to dramatically increase the military price Russia is paying for its intervention.\n\nAnd we could do all this, without burdening ourselves as we did in Iraq, with the task of sorting out Syria\u2019s future.\n\nThat requires an administration capable of devising, coordinating and executing a consistent military and diplomatic strategy. We don\u2019t have one.\n\nIt requires a president who understands the benefits of Pax Americana, doesn\u2019t think of foreign policy as a series of gimmes, is capable of rallying allies to a common cause, and understands that our liberal values are the great prerequisite for our global leadership.

I can relate to self-loathing. The reason a person lashes out the way Dixon does is because he hates himself, so anybody can relate to that. I\u2019m drawn to complex characters; they\u2019re all filled with so many different feelings, and that\u2019s what makes them interesting. The first \u201cIron Man,\u201d Tony Stark, was an interesting character. He drinks too much, he\u2019s a womanizer, and then he has this epiphany. That\u2019s what\u2019s interesting.\n\nWhat do you think it was about this role, and this film, that led to so many awards?\n\nIt\u2019s the transformational aspect of it, the fact that he was really many different roles wrapped up in one role. He\u2019s a doofus, he\u2019s a racist, he\u2019s violent, he\u2019s a mama\u2019s boy. There\u2019s a few heroic things at certain points.

It\u2019s a sort of dark fairy tale in certain ways \u2014 it\u2019s not necessarily meant to be completely realistic. And if it is meant to be realistic, in real life, things aren\u2019t tied up in a bow. People who deserve to get punished don\u2019t necessarily get punished.\n\nDid it surprise you that there was criticism of the movie along these lines?\n\nNo, whenever a movie is popular and it is a complex dramatic story, I think it\u2019s going to stir up a lot of feelings. A lot of good stuff come out of it \u2014 the billboards that have been popping up [activists recreated versions of the billboards in Miami and London]. That\u2019s kind of incredible, when a movie can effect social change, that\u2019s kind of astounding. I think Mildred [the film\u2019s mother, played by Frances McDormand, who is seeking justice in the murder of her daughter] is a really beautiful working-class wonder woman in some ways.

There were some tough kids there. When I was in middle school, there was a more white supremacist kind of group I didn\u2019t get along with. I got in a lot of fights with them and didn\u2019t win a lot of those fights. I didn\u2019t get along with the rich kids, people we called WPODs: white punks on dope. My school was interracial, and I met a cool group of friends who introduced me to some other friends. I used to do really bad break dancing, when \u201cThriller\u201d and \u201cPurple Rain\u201d came out. I was into Run-DMC, Grandmaster Flash, Doug E. Fresh, Eric B. & Rakim.

I\u2019ve worked with a lot of great actors. She\u2019s really a force. I think what\u2019s great about her is her integrity. Her sense of truth is like an iron bar.

In January, one of Mr. Nunes\u2019s staff members requested that copies be shared with the House committee as well, according to a person familiar with the request who was not authorized to talk about it publicly. Days later, the messages were published by Fox News, the person said.

Democrats have repeatedly accused Mr. Nunes of using his position to protect Mr. Trump from the investigation.\n\nThe House committee spent much of the last month locked in a bitter dispute over the secret Republican memorandum, which accused top F.B.I. and Justice Department officials of abusing their powers to spy on one of Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign advisers. Republicans released the document over the objections of the Justice Department and the F.B.I., which warned in a rare public statement that it was dangerously misleading.\n\nDemocrats called the document reckless and said it was merely a political tool to tarnish the agencies investigating Mr. Trump\u2019s potential ties to Russia.

This week, he was outraged when Sessions didn\u2019t personally investigate the Russia probe\u2019s relation to a Clinton campaign-financed dossier of potential Trump scandals. It was certainly what Roy Cohn would have done. But Sessions gave the job of inspecting the situation to the inspector general.\n\n\u201cDISGRACEFUL!\u201d tweeted the president. In another angry posting the president referred to the A.G. as \u201cSession,\u201d which suggested a certain emotional distance.\n\nThen the spelling was revised.

Last week, at a meeting on school safety, the president carefully placed Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi between himself and his own A.G. Bondi has been a presidential favorite for a long time. Perhaps you remember that she refused to join in a multistate suit against Trump University, a decision which had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that Donald had donated money to support her campaign.\n\nAlthough Sessions was obviously the highest-ranking person in the room besides the president, it was Bondi Trump called upon to speak first, praising her as \u201ca really tremendous attorney general.\u201d Sessions may have been a little hurt by having to wait his turn, but he nevertheless went on to burble some praise for the president\u2019s meeting with members of Congress on guns.\n\nTrump doled out one mini-compliment about Sessions\u2019s work fighting immigrant gangs, then quickly changed the subject to a rant about the state of California.

While it may not be a common vantage point, the narrative is a natural one for Marilyn Stern, a photographer and graphic artist who is a member of the Metropolitan Postcard Club of New York City.\n\nNot surprisingly, the vast majority of postcards that feature black people in the United States from the 19th and 20th centuries were very racist, she said.\n\n\u201cI was so sick of seeing these horrible racist stereotypes,\u201d said Ms. Stern, a collector since the mid-1970s. \u201cWhenever I came across something that was not racist or not stereotypical, or even went so far as showing romance between the races, I wanted to save it and collect it.\u201d\n\nHer collection, which numbers about 3,000, has about 300 postcards that depict African-American life in all lights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for us to fathom how isolated people were, especially in rural areas and isolated small towns before there were telephones and radios,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were postal deliveries three times a day, so it was the internet of the early 1900s.\u201d\n\nPostcards had better printing technology than magazines and newspapers did at the time, as the burst of color in the selection below shows. They could show racism with clarity. \u201cThe idea that you could see images so realistic blew people away,\u201d she said.\n\nMany of the racist postcards were a form of propaganda, she said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to see how racism was manifested in the past,\u201d she said, \u201cperhaps to better fight it in the present. You can recognize something if you\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d\n\nBelow is a selection from Ms. Stern\u2019s collection with descriptions based on her research.\n\nTrade Cards\n\nImage\n\nAfrican-Americans were often subjects \u2014 and targets \u2014 of advertising cards that were issued before 1900. These cards were frequently given away in products, or with the purchase of a product.\n\nAbove, an advertisement for J & P Coats thread. Below, a country doctor dispensing Ayer\u2019s Cathartic Pills.\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk, a dance created by plantation slaves as a satire of Southern white society, was the focus of these cards, which featured two black children and an African-American troupe that toured Europe in the late 1800s and early 1900s.\n\nRacist Cards\n\nImage\n\nThe card on the left was shot in a professional studio, but it was labeled \u201cHer Country Cousins.\u201d The implication was that no matter how refined, educated or successful black Americans became, they were still basically savages, Ms. Stern said.\n\nThe two cards on the right were produced in 1905 in New York on the common theme of the delivery stork. The first one, with the caption \u201cComparing Notes,\u201d shows both a black baby and a white baby, with no apparent bias. The second one shows two black babies with the slogan \u201cNo Race Suicide,\u201d implying that a high black birthrate threatened white supremacy, she said.\n\n\u201cLovers of All Nations\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThis postcard was from a series mailed in 1908 that was called \u201cLovers of All Nations.\u201d The banjo was a racial stereotype, but the card is in the non-discriminating \u201cFamily of Man\u201d tradition.\n\nMemories of Slavery\n\nImage\n\nPostcards once served as documentary photography. Some cards honored older African-Americans of the South, who were living memories of slavery. This was part of a series, and it was mailed in 1906.\n\nLife in the Jim Crow South\n\nImage\n\nA fortuneteller with white clients, mailed in 1908.\n\nHoliday Greetings\n\nImage\n\nIdealized country life, in a card mailed in 1907, as Americans flocked to cities.\n\nReligion\n\nImage\n\nA card, likely from the early 1950s, urging parishioners to come to church.\n\nReal Photos\n\nImage\n\nAn unidentified young woman in her graduation cap and gown, in a studio portrait taken between the 1920s and \u201940s. Cards labeled \u201cReal Photo Postcards\u201d are set apart from commercially printed postcards and are actual photographs printed on photographic paper with a preprinted postcard back.\n\nAchievement\n\nImage\n\nThe many important contributions that African-Americans made to society were rarely acknowledged in older postcards, but an exception was made for the scientist and educator George Washington Carver.\n\nHis experiments with peanuts, sweet potatoes and other crops contributed greatly to the economy of the South. This card \u2014 from a photo shot on Kodachrome or Ektachrome film \u2014 is from the late 1950s to mid-60s.\n\nFor more, see Ms. Stern\u2019s postcard blog, and a review of the film Through a Lens Darkly that deals with African-American representation in postcards and photography.

As a member of the State Department\u2019s Civil Service \u2014 as opposed to the foreign service, which typically fills the ranks of diplomats \u2014 it was highly unusual for Mrs. Jacobson to have ascended to the top slot in Mexico.\n\nBut Mrs. Jacobson\u2019s supporters say her extensive experience and connections in the country were crucial assets for Washington at a time of strain between the two neighbors, which have closely intertwined economies.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama named Mrs. Jacobson to the post in 2015, but a bitter partisan dispute in Congress meant nearly 11 months elapsed before she was confirmed. After she arrived in Mexico City, the honeymoon period did not last long.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s election abruptly changed the generally warm relations that the United States had developed with Mexico over the last 25 years \u2014 ones that Mrs. Jacobson had helped foster through much of her career. Mrs. Jacobson was left working with her Mexican counterparts to assuage growing concern \u2014 and anger \u2014 at the new president\u2019s tough talk.\n\nAt the same time, diplomacy on Mexico was being routed through the White House, via the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, which left Mrs. Jacobson with less authority.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Shannon Jr., the third-highest ranking official in the State Department. Mr. Shannon, the under secretary of state for political affairs who previously served as an ambassador to Brazil, Guatemala and Venezuela, announced his retirement last month.\n\nWhile Mr. Shannon said his decision had been made for personal reasons, the departure of another official, John Feeley, the ambassador to Panama, was more politically tinged. In his resignation letter this year, Mr. Feeley said he was leaving a long career in the government service because he felt he could no longer serve Mr. Trump.\n\nIn her letter to staff, Mrs. Jacobson focused mostly on the work she and her team had done during her tenure, and did not take any shots at the president.\n\n\u201cYou have respected everyone you came in contact with \u2014 Mexican, American, or from anywhere else, reflecting the better angels of our nature,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou know how great our two countries are.

Three years later she was transferred to the Western Hemisphere sector, where she remained for practically the rest of her career.\n\nHer interest in the area stemmed from the embrace of democracy that spread through the region in the 1980s, just as she was leaving college.\n\nShe served in numerous roles in Washington, including as deputy secretary for Western Hemisphere affairs for five years before she moved to Mexico, where she was a key broker in the agreement to re-establish relations between Cuba and the United States during the Obama administration.", "keywords": ["amid", "mrs", "mr", "leaving", "relations", "ambassador", "washington", "career", "jacobson", "mexico", "quit", "western", "trump", "service", "tense", "state"], "polarity": 0.0985069242531929, "subjectivity": 0.3347806422433289},

Even in rare cases when pragmatic business leaders helped to broker agreements, which was reportedly the case in North Carolina with the repeal of the so-called bathroom bill, a culture war still festers.\n\nC.E.O. activism has typically not brought people together, working from the middle out. Instead, this type of activism, largely from the progressive side, has begun to galvanize conservatives. For example, in Georgia, lawmakers stripped tax breaks for Delta over its decision to cut ties with the N.R.A.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the short term, Dick\u2019s will become another corporate poster child for how political polarization and so-called negative partisanship \u2014 an automatic rejection of members of the opposing party \u2014 are infecting our society. There will be a rash of news stories about increased sales from liberal consumers rushing into Dick\u2019s stores to vote with their wallets. Conservative media will point to boycotts and highlight other retailers that are stepping in to serve disaffected consumers.\n\nBut the real story will be the long game. C.E.O. activism represents a historic shift in the way corporations intersect with national politics. Rather than chief executives shaping political discourse, however, our toxic political environment is dictating corporate strategy. Instead of being cast as practical technocrats who could unite us, chief executives will be swept up in our cultural war, just like university presidents, celebrities, professional athletes and religious leaders before them.\n\nBrands are likely to become even more segmented into red and blue, strengthening the association between liberals and Priuses and conservatives and Cracker Barrel. Corporate brand campaigns could soon resemble political campaigns, with efforts to identify the most intensely loyal consumers for repeat purchases as opposed to attracting new ones.\n\nMainstream brands may become as common as moderate politicians \u2014 that is, a rare, perhaps extinct, species in today\u2019s political environment. Twitter and PayPal serve diverse customers today, but their recent efforts to regulate their own platforms have led to allegations of political bias and incited competitors.\n\nMost companies are not prepared for this new world of politics. Pepsi and Starbucks have already been victims of orchestrated fake news campaigns; there will be many more. As more companies take stands, those remaining will be named and shamed on social media, creating impossible choices in an environment where neutrality is not an option.\n\nLike our politicians, corporate chiefs will have to quickly figure out what stand they should take on the issue of the day by reflecting on their core convictions and estimating how their (customer) base will react. Like pollsters, they will have to assess which kind of consumers they can write off and which ones to curry favor with. The right answer will vary by a company\u2019s geographic location, who their employees are and how much they depend on favorable government regulation.\n\nThere is no going back. Lists are being kept and wins are being tallied by pressure groups aiming to get companies on their side. The issues that divide us will keep being served up in relentless succession, forcing companies to take stands on just about everything.\n\nMuch of this is a reflection of who we have become. Corporate America thrives by selling us what we want, and they do that by appealing to our identities. In 2018, for many Americans, our political identity seems to define us more than ever. It already influences whom we socialize with on Facebook, whom we marry, what news we read and where we live.

If you are making a decision when angry or exhausted, the most critical skill is self-regulation, which enables you to control your emotions, withstand pressure from others, resist temptation and check your impulses. Unlike cold cognitive abilities, self-regulation does not mature until about age 22, research has shown. (This is a good reason to raise the minimum age for purchasing firearms from 18 to 21 or older, as some have proposed.)\n\nThis psychological evidence is backed up by neuroscientific findings. Neuroimaging studies show that brain systems necessary for cold cognition are mature by mid-adolescence, whereas those that govern self-regulation are not fully developed until a person\u2019s early 20s.\n\nIf the voting age were lowered, would that necessitate changing other laws to bring them into alignment? Of course not. We use a wide variety of chronological ages to draw lines between minors and adults when it comes to smoking, driving, viewing violent or sexually explicit movies, being eligible for the death penalty and drinking alcohol. Although the specific ages used for these purposes often lack a good rationale, there is no reason lowering the voting age would require lowering, say, the drinking age, any more than allowing people to drive at 16 should permit them to drink or smoke at that age as well.\n\nIn addition to the scientific case for lowering the voting age, there is also a civic argument. Consider the dozen or so countries like Argentina, Austria, Brazil and Nicaragua that allow people to vote at 16 in national, state or local elections. In such countries, voter turnout among 16- and 17-year-olds is significantly higher than it is among older young adults.\n\nThis is true in parts of the United States as well. In Takoma Park, Md., a city that permits 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in local elections, that age group is twice as likely to vote than are 18-year-olds.\n\nWhy is higher turnout among 16- and 17-year-olds so important? Because there is evidence that people who don\u2019t vote the first time they are eligible are less likely to vote regularly in the future. Considering that people between 18 and 24 have the lowest voter turnout of any age group in the United States (a country that has one of the lowest rates of voter turnout in the developed world), allowing people to begin voting at an age at which they are more likely to vote might increase future turnout at all ages.\n\nThe last time the United States lowered the federal voting age was in 1971, when it went from 21 to 18. In that instance, the main motivating force was outrage over the fact that 18-year-olds could be sent to fight in Vietnam but could not vote.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe proposal to lower the voting age to 16 is motivated by today\u2019s outrage that those most vulnerable to school shootings have no say in how such atrocities are best prevented.

This week, several national chains, including Walmart, have responded to pressure and announced new restrictions on gun sales.\n\nBut there is another important step that private companies should take. They should promise not to sell a gun to anyone who doesn\u2019t pass a criminal background check. And, yes, the law currently allows sales to some people who do not.\n\nHere\u2019s how: In 1994, the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act began requiring criminal background checks for all guns sold by licensed sellers. (This is different from the broader background checks, which would also cover gun shows and private sales \u2014 and which public-health experts strongly favor.)\n\nThe Brady law gave law enforcement five days to conduct the background check. The National Rifle Association \u2014 showing it wasn\u2019t so concerned about criminals getting guns \u2014 lobbied to reduce the window to one day. Ultimately, Congress settled on three days.\n\nIt turns out that three days aren\u2019t enough time to conduct every background check. Millions of guns are sold every year, and background checks can be complex, spanning federal, state and local data. Last year, about 310,000 federal background checks \u2014 or 3.6 percent \u2014 were not completed in three days, according to ThinkProgress.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen that happens, the gun seller can decide whether to go through with the sale or not. The 2015 mass murder in a Charleston, S.C., church, for example, was committed with a gun bought after an incomplete background check. \u201cCurrent public policy,\u201d as Kristen Rand of the Violence Policy Center says, \u201cprioritizes transferring guns into buyers\u2019 hands above public safety.\u201d\n\nSome gun sellers do the right thing. A Walmart spokesman told my colleague Ian Prasad Philbrick that the company had not allowed a sale after an incomplete check for years. But it\u2019s unclear how many companies follow the same policy.\n\nThe best case is that Congress closes this loophole and requires a gun buyer to pass a background check, even if it takes more than three days. But I hope the new generation of activists don\u2019t wait for Congress. All gun sellers should be pressured to declare their policy publicly \u2014 and change that policy if they\u2019re selling guns to potential criminals.", "keywords": ["policy", "sign", "gun", "background", "times", "sellers", "days", "guns", "trump", "chaos", "checks", "check"], "polarity": 0.05244982290436836, "subjectivity": 0.4054521236339418},

None has so blithely ignored this conflict as Mr. Trump.\n\nPublic service can certainly be a family legacy in the United States, and name recognition is crucial to successful campaigns. So voters have proved willing to accept, or to be enticed by, a candidate\u2019s family connections, from the Adamses, to the Roosevelts, to the Kennedys, to the Bushes, to the 2016 presidential primary featuring the brother and son of two former presidents and the wife of yet another. But Americans\u2019 aversion to presidential nepotism has also been deep and lasting, even as presidents have tested it.\n\nJefferson was furious when John Adams appointed his son John Quincy Adams, already an accomplished diplomat, as the nation\u2019s first minister to Prussia. While even the younger Adams objected, his father retorted, \u201cThe sons of Presidents have the Same Claim to Liberty, Equality and the benefit of the Laws with all other Citizens.\u201d\n\nUntil 1857, presidents paid for their own White House staffs, and many named relatives to these jobs.

Kennedy\u2019s appointment of his brother Robert as attorney general that led to the first antinepotism law, in 1967. It prohibited presidents and members of Congress from appointing or promoting relatives and spouses \u201cin or to a civilian position in the agency in which he is serving or over which he exercises jurisdiction or control.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department has cited that law in a half-dozen legal opinions that prevented Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama from appointing relatives to roles as minor as unpaid clerical assistant.\n\nIn 1972, the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel opined that the law \u201cextends to any appointment to a \u2018civilian position\u2019 over which the president exercises jurisdiction or control\u201d and that \u201cit seems clearly applicable to subordinate positions on the White House staff.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department again cited the 1967 law in blocking Mr. Carter\u2019s plan to name his wife, Rosalynn, to lead a commission on mental health, even though first ladies have often been powerful informal advisers to their husbands.\n\nThen Bill Clinton pushed the boundaries between informal adviser and government employee by naming his wife, Hillary Clinton, to lead a White House task force on health care. There is no public evidence he sought the Justice Department\u2019s opinion on the legality of the appointment. But when a lawsuit accused the administration of violating a federal law that requires presidential advisory committees with any nongovernmental members to make their records public, the court maintained that Mrs. Clinton was in essence a federal employee, preventing the task force from being fully subject to the disclosure law.\n\nIn a twist of history, the acceptance of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s role handed her nemesis Donald Trump justification for putting his own relatives in power and running the White House like his private real estate business. In a January 2017 ruling, Daniel Koffsky, a career lawyer in the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, noted that the court said that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s appointment to a White House position did not violate the antinepotism law. He also said that a 1978 statute governing White House appointments granted the president \u201cspecial hiring authority,\u201d a position many ethics experts criticized.\n\nThe ruling allowed Mr. Trump to give his daughter Ivanka Trump and Mr. Kushner, her husband, White House offices and virtually unfettered access to the cabinet and world leaders.\n\nThe couple\u2019s many businesses offer foreign allies and adversaries a channel for seeking to influence American policy, fueling suspicion that the Trumps and Mr. Kushner are leveraging public office for private gain. The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that officials of at least four countries have discussed ways to manipulate the inexperienced Mr. Kushner by taking advantage of his family\u2019s financial difficulties and business entanglements.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Kushner\u2019s family has tried to leverage his position, too. They broadcast his role in the administration as part of a real estate sales pitch in Beijing, touting a controversial program that grants foreigners American visas in exchange for investments in development projects. On the same day as Mr. Trump\u2019s first meeting with President Xi Jinping of China \u2014 who was serenaded by the president\u2019s grandchildren \u2014 Ms. Trump\u2019s company was awarded three trademarks in the Chinese market.\n\nAfter the meeting, the Pangoal Institution, a Beijing think tank, described the Trump White House as a tribal battleground dominated by the \u201cTrump family clan.\u201d The New Yorker quoted the think tank\u2019s assessment that the Trump family seems to \u201cdirectly influence final decisions\u201d on business and international relations in a way that \u201chas rarely been seen in the political history of the United States.\u201d The analysis used an ancient Chinese expression meaning \u201cto treat the state as your possession,\u201d a feudal concept of governance that conflicts with basic American principles.\n\nAppalling as it is, White House nepotism is only one element of Mr. Trump\u2019s broader determination to install unqualified friends, patrons and political lackeys across the government.\n\nThe founders would have dreaded a president like Mr. Trump. His behavior is a warning that ethical traditions and culture are not enough. Lawmakers need to harden some of these norms into law, to safeguard the executive branch and the public trust from future presidents eager to use America\u2019s highest office to benefit their families.", "keywords": ["mr", "white", "intrigue", "presidents", "law", "public", "relatives", "family", "appointment", "trump", "house"], "polarity": 0.10907287157287159, "subjectivity": 0.3383984938672438},

I love you guys.\u201d\n\nSeemingly channeling Earnhardt, who went by the nickname The Intimidator, Dillon bumped the leader Aric Almirola on the last lap, pushing him into the wall before zooming past.

That was cool.\u201d\n\nWallace wiped away tears throughout his post-race news conference, his voice often cracking.\n\n\u201cNo matter what the circumstances are, when you have family here and you run good and it\u2019s been a while since you\u2019ve been somewhat competitive, it pulls on the heartstrings.

Ms. Hicks surely saw this narrow path to success under Mr. Trump and decided to walk it. The dutiful daughter strategy is one a man in her position could never have used. Mr. Trump, with his affinity for military men and mockery of male emotion would have seen such a subservient man as weak, but Ms. Hicks cannily leveraged the president\u2019s own misogyny to her advantage.\n\nIt\u2019s not the most feminist of moves, but Ms. Hicks was also in a position that many young women can recognize: working for a sexist boss who likes the women in his life, romantic and professional, to be slim variations on a very particular feminine model.

Playing nice for such a president is a different calculation than, say, a dental hygienist, lawyer or Walmart cashier might make under a similarly sexist supervisor.\n\nBeing new to working in the political world, Ms. Hicks may not have made that decision at all. If you don\u2019t see politics as a vehicle for positive change but rather as an abstraction shape-shifted into a job, and if you view the presidency as about power rather than public service, of course working to get your boss elected and then working closely with him in the White House would feel like nothing more than an exciting career opportunity. Why wouldn\u2019t Ms. Hicks use every tool in her arsenal to remain in the good graces of her volatile boss, and climb up the ladder accordingly?\n\nAnd yet, suddenly, she climbed off. It seems unlikely Ms. Hicks had a crisis of conscience; nor is she, an adult woman with agency and considerable privilege, a victim of her circumstances. More likely, she\u2019s motivated by the same thing as her boss: unadulterated self-interest. Perhaps, finally, she realized the good-girl game is rigged to let the boys win.\n\nThe problem with being the mostly silent hardworking nice girl is that you also might end up the fall guy \u2014 the one who stays up all night finishing the project while your less-diligent peers knock off, the one who simply smiles tightly as a male colleague takes credit for your work. Or the one who, having long been a sympathetic filial ear for your very undisciplined boss, is finally being forced to talk \u2014 and realizing that your story does not sound good.\n\nMs. Hicks has already admitted to telling \u201cwhite lies\u201d for the president, a thoroughly banal disclosure from a member of an administration that hemorrhages blatant falsities as a matter of course, but that may prove problematic depending on who she lied to and what about.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe dutiful daughter gig always has a shelf life \u2014 maybe you get too old for it to be convincing; maybe your work environment changes and success hinges less on pleasing one prone-to-flattery man; maybe you learn the hard way that women who seek to ascend to the top eventually have to choose between being liked or respected (in a far more atypical scenario, maybe you find yourself embroiled in a federal investigation and investigators just aren\u2019t going for the good-girl routine). At some point, most of us either choose or are forced to be adult women who own our ambition and take responsibility for our decisions.\n\nThe unfortunate truth is that Ms. Hicks probably isn\u2019t there yet. Her departure is more likely a ticket to a lucrative PR or consulting gig than evidence of any quasi-feminist awakening or rejection of Trump-wrought devastation \u2014 there are a lot of companies no doubt eager to hire a compliant, inoffensive woman with access to the president, and offer her substantial sums in exchange.\n\nBut one can hope there\u2019s something more interesting brewing beneath that placid surface.

I started this latest round of the debate with the presumption that supporters of moderate gun restrictions are popularly strong but legislatively weak. Since Sandy Hook in 2012, more than two dozen states have passed gun laws and almost all of those laws have LOOSENED gun restrictions. Roughly 360 gun bills have been introduced in Congress, and they have all failed but one, which also loosened gun use.\n\nThe blunt fact is that Republicans control most legislatures. To get anything passed, I thought, it would be necessary to separate some Republicans from the absolutist N.R.A. position. To do that you have to depolarize the issue: show gun owners some respect, put red state figures at the head and make the gun discussion look more like the opioid discussion. The tribalists in this country have little interest in the opioid issue. As a result, a lot of pragmatic things are being done across partisan lines.\n\nThe people pushing for gun restrictions have basically done the exact opposite of what I thought was wise. Instead of depolarizing the issue they have massively polarized it. The students from Parkland are being assisted by all the usual hyper-polarizing left-wing groups: Planned Parenthood, Move On and the Women\u2019s March. The rhetoric has been extreme. Marco Rubio has been likened to a mass murderer while the N.R.A. has been called a terrorist organization.\n\nThe early results would seem to completely vindicate my position. The Florida Legislature turned aside gun restrictions. New gun measures in Congress have been quickly shelved. Democrats are more likely to lose House and Senate seats in the key 2018 pro-gun states. The losing streak continues.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet I have to admit that something bigger is going on.

Late last season, Wallace, who goes by the nickname Bubba, got four rides with Richard Petty Motorsports. It was enough for Petty, one of Nascar\u2019s most iconic names, to not only give Wallace a full-time ride, but also to give him his famed No. 43 racecar to drive. Wallace is the first African-American to drive full-time in the top Nascar series since Wendell Scott in 1971.\n\nPetty insisted, though, that he is colorblind when it comes to evaluating talent. Sure, it would be great if Wallace brings the sport into the African-American community, but as far as Petty is concerned, that\u2019s secondary.\n\n\u201cI hope he advances us as a race team,\u201d Petty said in an email. \u201cI care about what Bubba can do behind the wheel for us. The rest, there are a lot of eyes on Bubba, but he\u2019s handling it well. I know come Sunday he\u2019ll be ready to get into a racecar and just show his talent. If he does well, the rest will come and he\u2019ll grow our fan base.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThose eyes on Wallace, much as they were on Tiger Woods a generation ago, prompted Earnhardt to call him last week.

But there\u2019s also venturing out into a different market, into different avenues where the African-American culture lives. We all have to do better at that.\u201d\n\nThere are challenges, of course. On social media, where vulgar epithets can be spewed from faceless and fictitious monikers, Wallace has, at times, had to think twice before responding. He admits he has not always been successful.\n\n\u201cThere is always going to be haters out there, people who don\u2019t want to see you succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that since Day 1 from my parents. Just keep your head down and keep moving, that\u2019s the best you can do.\u201d\n\nBlaney, his closest friend on the circuit, has been around Wallace when offensive remarks have been made.\n\n\u201cThankfully, it\u2019s very, very rare, but it upsets me,\u201d Blaney said. \u201cBubba\u2019s great at handling it. He\u2019s an amazing ambassador for the sport. And he\u2019s really talented and a heck of a competitor. All of us are competitive, but his competitiveness is unlike anyone I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nNascar\u2019s diversity has become an issue again after its only female racer, Danica Patrick, announced she will retire from the circuit after the Daytona 500.

This is the most diverse country in the world, but we have to improve diversity in Nascar. If we can make the sport more diverse, we\u2019ll see the same thing with fans.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nMeanwhile, about your companion\u2019s steak dinner: Most of the tax cut actually consisted of huge tax breaks for corporations, which is in effect a big tax cut for stockholders. And while many Americans own a bit of stock via their retirement accounts, even if you include these indirect holdings, more than 80 percent of stocks are owned by the wealthiest 10 percent of the population. So on the face of it, the wealthy are giving themselves a big gift, and sending the bill to the middle class.\n\nNow, the tax cut\u2019s defenders insist that it won\u2019t really work that way, that the benefits of lower corporate taxes will trickle down to workers instead. How\u2019s that supposed to happen?\n\nWell, the theory is that lower corporate taxes will draw in lots of money from overseas, which corporations will invest in new plants and equipment, which will drive up the demand for labor, which will raise wages. And to be fair, there\u2019s probably something to this theory \u2014 something, but not very much.\n\nFirst of all, even if the process were to work as advertised, it would take a long time \u2014 probably decades. Even the most optimistic analyses suggest that there would be little effect on wages for the first few years, which means that for now what looks like a tax break for the wealthy is, in fact, a tax break for the wealthy.\n\nSecond, the story relies on a long chain of events with multiple weak links. For example, corporations with monopoly power won\u2019t see lower taxes as a reason to invest more; they\u2019ll just take the money. Meanwhile, there\u2019s growing evidence that big employers are using their power to suppress wages; cutting their taxes won\u2019t change that fact. So even in the long run we shouldn\u2019t expect a lot of trickle-down.\n\nBut wait \u2014 weren\u2019t there a lot of stories about companies using the tax cut to give their workers bonuses? Yes, there were \u2014 but only because the news media let themselves get played. Most of those bonuses would have happened anyway: In an economy with low unemployment, there are always some companies deciding to pay a bit more to attract workers. But companies had every incentive to pretend that the tax cut was responsible, if only to curry favor with the Trump administration.\n\nAnd in any case the bonus hype was out of all proportion to the reality. So far, we\u2019ve seen about $6 billion in bonuses versus more than $170 billion in stock buybacks, that is, handing money to wealthy stockholders. And money spent on buybacks is money that isn\u2019t being invested in plants and equipment, the supposed point of the tax cut.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo the message to middle-class taxpayers is, if you think you were helped by the tax cut, think again.

He became senior editor there in 1958 and later executive editor. He worked for the magazine into his 80s.\n\n\u201cBefore the Mayflower\u201d established Mr. Bennett as a leading scholarly voice during the racial ferment of the 1960s. In 1966 he testified before a House Education subcommittee looking into racism and unrest, and was blunt, tracing the turmoil of the times to an education system that did not prepare students to live in a multiracial society.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt is my opinion, and the opinion of many writers and scholars in this field,\u201d he said, \u201cthat segregated textbooks \u2014 and segregated and segregating use of words, symbols and ideas \u2014 are as dangerous to the internal peace of America as segregated schools and residential areas.\u201d\n\nThat was relatively mild compared with what he said about Abraham Lincoln in a January 1968 article in Ebony. Despite his reputation as an emancipator, Mr. Bennett wrote, Lincoln was actually a white supremacist who thought that the races would be better off separated, \u201cpreferably with the Atlantic Ocean or some other large, deep body of water between them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe man\u2019s character, his way with words and his assassination, together with the psychological needs of a racist society, have obscured his contradictions under a mountain of myths,\u201d he added.\n\nIn an interview after the article was published, he stuck to his guns. \u201cLast year, during the riot season, President Johnson said he hoped he would handle himself as Lincoln did during the Civil War,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he does, it will be a disaster.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Bennett expanded on his argument in 2000 in the book \u201cForced Into Glory: Abraham Lincoln\u2019s White Dream.\u201d The historian James M.

She died in 2009. His survivors include their daughters, Joy, Constance and Courtney, and three grandchildren. A son, Lerone III, died in 2013. Mr. Bennett lived in Chicago.\n\nIn an oral history recorded in 2010 for the National Visionary Leadership Project, which collects the stories of notable black Americans, Mr. Bennett talked about a three-part approach to affecting change.\n\n\u201cEvery black person is obligated,\u201d he said, \u201cto try to do what he does as well as any person who ever lived can do it, or any person who ever lives can do it; then, to try to save one \u2014 just one \u2014 person if you can. And then to struggle to destroy a system which is multiplying black victims faster than all the black intellectuals and the black leaders in America can talk about.

Townships have gotten electricity and more modern housing. Government contracts have been set aside for black would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nThese programs have had an impact, improving material conditions and generating jobs.\n\nThey have also been riddled with corruption.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt local governments across South Africa, bureaucrats have abused their authority to steer contracts to companies that put cash in their pockets. At every level of society, people have grown accustomed to kickbacks and political connections determining who prospers, and who goes without.\n\nMr. Zuma\u2019s demise resonates as a sign of a potential new order taking shape. He will forever be linked to his association with the Guptas, three Indian-born brothers who effectively bought key levers of governmental power, amassing influence so comprehensive that it became known as \u201cstate capture.\u201d\n\nHis resignation has raised hopes that South Africa is finally contending with its epidemic of corruption. That view gained momentum when an elite police unit raided a home belonging to the Guptas nearly at the same moment that Mr. Ramaphosa was assuming office.\n\nThe new president is a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle, a former deputy president and chairman of the National Planning Commission, a focal point for thinking about how to engineer economic growth. As a former trade union leader and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Mandela, he enjoys credibility among a range of interest groups, while carrying a reputation as a savvy and strategic operator.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe has had his brushes with controversy, most notably after a 2012 police massacre of striking platinum miners that killed 34 people. At the time, Mr. Ramaphosa occupied a seat on the board of Lonmin, the company that owned the mine. Emails soon surfaced showing that, a day before the police opened fire, Mr. Ramaphosa had been urging senior government officials to take strong action to end the strike.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, no corruption charges have stuck to the new president, who now claims a mandate to clean up the toxic mess left behind by Mr. Zuma.\n\nSome doubt whether the A.N.C. can be salvaged as an effective vehicle for egalitarian policymaking. The party\u2019s executive ranks include many figures implicated in corruption. Mr. Ramaphosa, 65, may champion new initiatives aimed at generating economic growth, yet he finds himself relying on his party brethren to execute his visions, with no certainty that the money will land where intended.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think that taking the president out does much to dismantle the patronage network,\u201d said Ayabonga Cawe, a development economist at Xesibe Holdings, a research and advisory firm in Johannesburg. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need a lot more than taking out the guy at the top.\u201d\n\nAbove all, Mr. Ramaphosa must contend with the structural defects that have long constrained South Africa\u2019s economy, a legacy of apartheid.\n\nBeyond its systemic discrimination against black people, apartheid severed the country from much of the global economy. It ensured that huge numbers of uneducated black South Africans were available at poverty-level wages within major sectors of the economy like mining, agriculture and textiles. That cushioned domestic companies from the pressure to modernize.\n\nPhoto\n\nInternational sanctions isolated South Africa, shielding its firms from competition against multinational rivals. Sanctions also denied South African companies the ability to operate abroad, giving them an incentive to focus on the domestic market. The apartheid-era government obliged with subsidies for favored firms while allowing companies to pursue oligopoly, free of nuisances like antitrust law.\n\nThe result was a system in which large industries, from retail to furniture-making to chemicals, were dominated by huge enterprises whose core strength was the ability to protect themselves against competition. That system has largely prevailed, with smaller companies and start-ups facing often-impossible odds.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cApartheid was a system that lends itself to large conglomerates and concentrations of wealth in the hands of a few,\u201d Mr. Cawe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the corruption. It\u2019s about all of these parallel networks in big business that you need to dismantle. Most of those are white.\u201d\n\nHere is a world that Mr. Ramaphosa knows keenly, having achieved extraordinary affluence by running South African companies with interests in mining, banking, real estate and telecommunications. His fortune has been estimated at $450 million.\n\nIf he is serious about reinvigorating the economy and creating a space for black-owned small businesses, he will need to take on the prevailing structure that made him so wealthy.\n\nHis success on that front may be even more decisive than whether he can tame corruption.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly the most optimistic moment for South Africa in a very long time,\u201d said Mr. Goldin, the former adviser to Mr. Mandela. \u201cIn a way, it does feel like a new beginning.

But Mr. Trump has lagged other presidents in filling executive branch positions, large numbers of posts are still empty, and his White House has seen record-breaking staff turnover.\n\nIn seeking to influence the executive branch, the president is not without help. He relies on what the political scientist John Hart called the \u201cpresidential branch\u201d \u2014 which consists of almost 2,000 staff members, several hundred under the White House proper and the rest in a variety of management organizations (National Security Council, Council of Economic Advisers, Office of Management and Budget) within the Executive Office of the President.\n\nThe advisers in the Executive Office and White House offer the president unbiased information and advice that serve his agenda. At least in theory. In practice, they pose a particular danger to a weak president. The political scientist Jonathan Bernstein has detailed how executive governance suffers in the absence of presidential leadership and can empower rogue policy entrepreneurship. As examples, he points to the policy debacles of Iraq under George W. Bush and the Iran-contra scandal under Ronald Reagan.\n\nThe Executive Office advisers not only have discretion over the information the president receives but also have opportunities to derail presidential proposals before they can even see the light of day.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEffectively managing the White House has been a challenge for all modern presidents. One prerequisite is an ability to articulate a policy vision and persuade senior advisers to develop and carry it out. Mr. Trump\u2019s visible lack of control over the White House is in part rooted in his lack of firm policy beliefs \u2014 about immigration, gun control or foreign policy. Chaos is rampant in the Trump White House largely because the president is weak and easily manipulated by those who have access.\n\nA mismanaged White House, a poor professional reputation and a weak presidency are not impossible to fix. Like Mr. Trump, other first-year presidents have had trouble adapting to the power dynamics of the White House and the Washington community. While some never recovered from disastrous starts (Jimmy Carter), others found their footing and became widely influential over the executive agencies (Bill Clinton).\n\nUnfortunately, the current state of the White House already reflects the most obvious fix Mr. Trump could make: bringing in a more empowered and competent chief of staff. By most accounts, John Kelly had succeeded in improving the information flow, removing some of the key factional actors and reducing the leaks. A more experienced White House hand could probably do better, but at this point it isn\u2019t clear Mr. Trump could attract that sort of A-list talent.\n\nIf the president is unwilling or incapable of getting control of the White House, he will continue to find his reputation lacking and his ability to influence the executive branch minimal. That may be enough for Mr. Trump, who often seems driven by anything but the desire to influence policy.\n\nBut a weak president is not something to cheer. Set aside the dangers of a weak leader engaging in risky foreign policy to try to improve his public standing.

But it hedged its narrative bets: The first season balanced Diane\u2019s challenges fitting in at her new firm with a story line about a Madoff-like financial scandal that didn\u2019t have a racial dimension (and in which the principal characters were mostly white).\n\nAs Season 2 opens (it begins streaming Sunday on CBS All Access), that\u2019s still the approach \u2014 two continuing story lines (outside of the legal cases of the week) that share Diane and several other characters, but are essentially separate, in their own bubbles.

Favorable views were 37.5 for Trump and 41.8 percent for Clinton.\n\nAbramowitz and Webster compiled data from the 2012 and 2016 elections to show how much the level of anger among both Democratic and Republican voters increased over four years.\n\nIn 2012, 33 percent of Democrats and 43 percent of Republicans described themselves as angry at the opposing party\u2019s presidential candidate \u201cmost of the time\u201d or \u201cjust about always.\u201d In 2016, the percentage of Democratic voters who said they were this angry at Trump rose to 73 percent, and the percentage of Republicans with that level of hostility toward Hillary Clinton rose to 66 percent.\n\nThis trend helps explain seemingly contradictory voter attitudes catalogued in both \u201cAll Politics is National\u201d and a second Abramowitz-Webster paper, \u201cNegative Partisanship: Why Americans Dislike Parties but Behave like Rabid Partisans.\u201d\n\nFrom one vantage point, the view of each major party has steadily worsened. As Abramowitz and Webster point out:\n\nThe percentage of Americans with favorable opinions of both parties is now the lowest it has been since the American National Election Studies began asking this question in 1978.\n\nAt the same time, \u201crecord numbers of voters in 2016 were dissatisfied with their own party\u2019s presidential nominee.\u201d Trump and Clinton\n\nwere the most unpopular major party candidates for president since the ANES introduced the feeling thermometer scale in 1968.\n\nThe \u201cfeeling thermometer scale\u201d asks voters to rank candidates and institutions on a scale of 0 to 100, in which 100 is very warm or favorable, zero is very cold or unfavorable and 50 is neutral or no feeling.\n\nThe accompanying graphic shows that both Democrats and Republicans had favorable views of their own candidates from 1968 to 2012, ranging from 76.5 percent in 1968 to 78.5 percent in 2012. In 2016, however, with Trump and Clinton as the nominees, the thermometer rating dropped sharply to 60.9 percent.\n\nThe Political Winds: Chillier A survey has tracked the average \u201ctemperature\u201d rating given by voters of their own political party\u2019s presidential candidate and the opposing party\u2019s candidate since 1968. 100 (BEST) Own party\u2019s candidate 77 75 56 61 50 (NEUTRAL) The other party\u2019s candidate 25 12 0 (WORST) \u201968 \u201972 \u201976 \u201980 \u201984 \u201988 \u201992 \u201996 \u201900 \u201904 \u201908 \u201912 \u201916\n\nOver the same period, \u201cfeeling thermometer\u201d ratings of the opposition candidate fell sharply, from 56.2 in 1968 to 25.1 in 2012. In 2016, the ratings of the opposition candidate plummeted to 12.2.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDespite the public\u2019s increasingly adverse views of political parties, party loyalty in voting has now reached record levels, according to the two authors. Partisanship currently \u201chas a stronger influence on vote choice than at any time since the 1950s.\u201d\n\nHow can these conflicting trends be reconciled? Voters dislike the parties and are dissatisfied with their candidates, even as they cast straight-ticket ballots. This may sound inconsistent, but it\u2019s not that hard to understand.\n\nAccording to Abramowitz and Webster, in 2016, \u201clarge majorities of Democrats and Republicans truly despised the opposing party\u2019s nominee.\u201d Voters were motivated to go to the polls to cast ballots against the opposition\u2019s nominee much more than to support their own party\u2019s choice. The key factor \u201cin predicting party loyalty in the 2016 presidential election was how voters felt about the opposing party\u2019s presidential candidate.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIn fact, Abramowitz and Webster found that \u201cthis measure was twice as important in predicting loyalty as feelings toward the candidate from one\u2019s own party.\u201d Partisan loyalty remained \u201cvery high because both Democratic and Republican identifiers overwhelmingly viewed the opposing party\u2019s candidate with deep hostility.\u201d\n\nIn the 1970s, about a quarter of all voters split their tickets, voting for presidential and congressional candidates of different parties. Now, not even one in 10 does so. The result:\n\nIn 2016, all 34 Senate elections and 400 of 435 U.S. House elections were won by the party winning the presidential election in the state or district.\n\nIn their analysis of negative partisanship, Iyengar and Krupenkin argue that voting on the basis of hostility has an unexpected consequence: It lessens pressure on the winner to be accountable to his or her supporters, effectively freeing winners to thumb their noses at many of the voters who put them in office:\n\nWhen citizens\u2019 support for a candidate stems primarily from their strong dislike for the opposing candidate, they are less subject to the logic of accountability. Their psychic satisfaction comes more from defeating and humiliating the out-group, and less from any performance or policy benefits that might accrue from the victory of the in-party. For this group of voters, candidates have every incentive to inflame partisan negativity, further entrenching affective polarization.\n\nBy this logic, Iyengar and Krupenkin argue that\n\nIf partisans care less about their own party\u2019s performance and instead focus on their distrust of the opposition party, elected officials no longer need campaign on their own merits; instead, they have good reason to try even harder to denigrate the opposition.\n\nIn other words, Trump critics who anticipate a collapse of support when he fails to deliver on campaign promises are likely to be disappointed. According to Iyengar and Krupenkin,\n\nThe primal sense of \u201cus against them\u201d makes partisans fixate on the goal of defeating and even humiliating the opposition at all costs. This negativity bias in voting behavior undermines traditional theories of electoral accountability that rest on incumbents\u2019 ability to deliver policy and performance benefits.\n\nCandidates and incumbents, Iyengar and Krupenkin continue, \u201care less likely to be sanctioned for demonstrating incompetence, dishonesty and unethical behavior.\u201d\n\nTo make their point, the authors cite Roy Moore, the Republican candidate for Senate in Alabama last December, pointing out that under partisan conditions \u201ca candidate accused of molesting teenage children is able to attract 91 percent of the vote from his copartisans.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat explains the extraordinary level of support for Moore, not only from Republican voters but also from the larger population of white Alabamians, at 68 percent, and conservatives, at 83 percent?\n\nThey can\u2019t all have been happy with their candidate, but a partial answer can be found in a study published last month, \u201cOne Tribe to Bind Them All: How Our Social Group Attachments Strengthen Partisanship,\u201d by Lilliana Mason and Julie Wronski, political scientists at the University of Maryland and the University of Mississippi.\n\nThe authors found that just as the Democratic Party is often described as a collection of identity groups, identity politics have also become a powerful force within the Republican Party. They argue, in fact, that \u201cthis effect is more powerful among Republicans than among Democrats, due to the general social homogeneity of the Republican Party,\u201d with the result that \u201cRepublicans are more susceptible to identity-based politics.\u201d For Republicans,\n\nthe general white, Christian conservative alliance with the party led to a far simpler categorization of who is in the group and who is outside of it.\n\nWhy would this lead to more willingness to vote for someone with as much baggage as Roy Moore? The convergence of voter identification with voters\u2019 social identity \u2014 conservative, white, Christian \u2014 \u201cmakes in-party preference more powerful and out-party tolerance ever more difficult.\u201d\n\nPut another way, Republican doubts about Roy Moore were superseded by hatred of the Democratic Party.\n\nThere is no sign that the growth in negative polarization will slow down, much less reverse itself. The dominant incentive in politics right now is to capitalize on animosity to the opposition party.\n\nAt a time when true swing voters have become a smaller and smaller share of the electorate, hatred, anger and animosity have proven the most effective tools to mobilize support.\n\nBy email, I asked Webster and Iyengar the following question: \u201cDoes negative partisanship override polarization on issues of race, sex, immigration, feminism, traditional family structure, LGBT issues, military spending and policy, etc.?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWebster replied:\n\nI\u2019d be more inclined to say that negative partisanship has helped to perpetuate and exacerbate the degree of partisan polarization that we have in the U.S.\n\nIyengar contended that \u201caffective divergence exceeds policy-related divergence.\u201d A more \u201c \u2018primal\u2019 view of partisanship\u201d has been gaining strength among social scientists, he wrote, noting the discovery\n\nthat children acquired a sense of party identification quite early in the life cycle without any \u201cflickering awareness\u201d of party differences on the issues. Moreover, as people moved through the life cycle, with corresponding changes in economic circumstances and interests, their sense of partisanship was unmoved despite considerable change in their stances on the issues.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, succinctly described the role of negative partisanship in contemporary American politics during a January interview with Michael Lewis: \u201cAnger and fear is what gets people to the polls.\u201d\n\nThe data support Bannon. The Pew Research Center found in June 2016 that the demonization \u2014 vilification \u2014 of political opponents has become entrenched:\n\nToday, sizable shares of both Democrats and Republicans say the other party stirs feelings of not just frustration, but fear (56 percent of Democrats, 49 percent of Republicans) and anger (47 percent Democrats, 46 percent Republicans).\n\nNot only do almost half of Republicans say Democrats are lazier than other Americans, more dishonest (45 percent), more closed-minded (52 percent) and more immoral (47 percent), most (59 percent) also say the members of their own party are more hard-working.\n\nThe Pew findings offer little comfort to those seeking concord. Some 70 percent of Democrats \u201csay that Republicans are more closed-minded than other Americans.\u201d Four out of ten Democrats say \u201cRepublicans are more dishonest,\u201d and a third say Republicans are immoral and unintelligent.\n\nAs partisan conflict increasingly resembles guerrilla warfare, as political opponents despise each other as a matter of routine, the tactic of \u201cenemy construction\u201d takes root. A \u201cfriend-enemy\u201d dichotomy gains strength. Opponents are demonized, defamed, delegitimated and dehumanized \u2014 \u201cjustifying the compromise of ordinarily recognized liberties\u201d\u2014 in the words of RonNell Andersen Jones and Lisa Grow Sun in \u201cEnemy Construction and the Press.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cThe Existential Need for Enemy\u201d Gy\u00f6rgy Csepeli, Zolt\u00e1n V\u00e1gi and Rich\u00e1rd Nagyfi write:\n\nEach party holds negative, stereotypical images of the other stemming from the need to justify the deeds of hostility. The negative and simplified stereotypes are needed in order to simplify the conflict excluding discoveries of similarities between the groups in conflict. The individuals in intergroup conflict systematically tend to misperceive each other to accentuate differences. The resulting images tend to perpetuate negative stereotypes of each other containing oversimplified, inaccurate and derogatory beliefs concerning the other group that are identified as the enemies.\n\nJust as adversaries are denigrated, allies are praised:\n\nThe image of self, in contrast, reflects glorification of everyone who is alike. A mirror image emerges in which each party sees the other one negatively and itself positively. On the basis of the overgeneralized difference stemming from the categorization into in-group and out-group, the group members in each group necessarily will be pushed into the labyrinth of cognitive biases which are the cornerstones of the hostile image of the other.\n\nAs politics become a form of mortal combat, a strange burden falls on those who are most engaged. In the words of the conservative German jurist and political theorist Carl Schmitt \u2014 who as a supporter of the Third Reich knew something about hatred \u2014 the combatants must, as he wrote in \u201cThe Theory of the Partisan,\u201d\n\nconsider the other side as entirely criminal and inhuman, as totally worthless. Otherwise they are themselves criminal and inhuman. The logic of value and its obverse, worthlessness, unfolds its annihilating consequence, compelling ever new, ever deeper discriminations, criminalizations, and devaluations to the point of annihilating all of unworthy life.\n\nIt is not too much to say that a significant number of voters in both of America\u2019s major political parties see their adversaries as worthless. And history teaches us that the logic of worthlessness has chilling implications.", "keywords": ["voters", "loyalty", "loathing", "partys", "presidential", "2016", "partisanship", "party", "negative", "candidate", "republicans", "democrats", "motivates"], "polarity": 0.0585947514225816, "subjectivity": 0.46049069536333714},

She takes comfort from local efforts like a project in Utica, N.Y., where Bosnian Muslim immigrants and local Unitarian Christians watched a Super Bowl together. She applauds aggressive racial integration programs like those run by the American military. She cites her own teaching experience in small seminars at Yale, where students from divergent backgrounds overcame disagreements to achieve mutual respect, sometimes even friendship.\n\nPhoto\n\nYet the scholar in Chua acknowledges that these individual experiences offer less of a social lesson than she would wish.\n\n\u201cStudies show that minimal or superficial exposure to out-group members can actually worsen group division. \u2026 Negative interactions with people from other groups also increase group hostility. So merely putting members of different groups in the same space is not enough and indeed can aggravate political tribalism.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Chua falls back on the very attitude to which she turned her sharply skeptical gaze at the beginning of the book: the conviction that the United States was, is and will remain an exceptional nation, different from all the others. In her introduction, Chua remarked that the United States as a supertribal entity indifferent to ethnicity and culture became at best a partial reality only a generation ago. By book\u2019s end, however, the battered ideal has been polished and refurbished.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Will we, telling ourselves \u2018These immigrants are different,\u2019 be the weak link, the first generation to fail? Will we forget who we are?\u201d That\u2019s inspiring, and even more so are the citations of Martin Luther King Jr., Lin-Manuel Miranda and Langston Hughes that finish the book.\n\nInspiring \u2014 but not wholly reassuring. A lot of the interest of \u201cPolitical Tribes\u201d comes from the strong sense it emanates of an author arguing with herself. Chua both condemns tribalism and respects its power. She insists that the United States alone of nations among the earth has often transcended it \u2014 and then presents impressive contrary evidence from the past and the present. Chua reckons with the many tribalisms of the American past: ethnic, religious and racial. She hopes for a future in which tribalism fades \u2014 even as she mercilessly details its accumulating strength.\n\nAs Chua notes, tribes can coalesce out of previously unrelated pieces. Immigrants to Europe from North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia \u2014 of different languages, ethnicities, folkways and religious practices \u2014 raised children who created for themselves a new identity as post-ethnic Muslims. ISIS, as Chua mordantly observes, is in its own way a melting pot, bringing together young men and women from across Europe, Asia and the Americas to fight for a new ideology. She quotes a New York Times article about young British girls lured to ISIS. For them, \u201cIslam is punk rock.\u201d\n\nTribes can be created by fission as well as by fusion. Chua suggests that in the United States, divisions that would once have been understood as class divides have been reinterpreted in our time as cultural, even when they are not ethnic. \u201cWhite Americans often hold their biggest disdain for other white Americans \u2014 the ones on the opposite side of the cultural divide.\u201d\n\nThese fast-evolving and ever-changing identities may look contingent from the outside. They feel overwhelmingly powerful to those inside. Chua repeatedly scolds American policymakers for underestimating the importance of ethnocultural identity in Vietnam in the 1960s, Venezuela in the 1990s and Afghanistan in the 2000s. Through her book pulses an evident worry that tribal claims are now overpowering national ones within the United States. If she cannot quite bring herself to make her own anxieties explicit \u2014 or figure out what if anything to do to address them \u2014 she is hardly alone.

NeverTrumpers haunt the conservative movement the way Polish or Czech dissident intellectuals such as Czeslaw Milosz and Vaclav Havel haunted that segment of Central European intelligentsia that made its peace with Stalinism after World War II.\n\nThe Trumpers (and Stalinists) traded conscience for power; the NeverTrumpers and dissidents chose the reverse. Conscience can be made to suffer, but in the end it usually wins.\n\nThat\u2019s why NeverTrumpers matter; why the Trumpers know they matter (which they prove every time they feverishly assert the opposite); and why progressives who dismiss NeverTrumpers as politically irrelevant are wrong. The United States is going to have a right-of-center party in one form or another, and it matters a great deal whether that party is liberal or illiberal, capable or incapable of shame.\n\nCredible conservatives like Charen can still make a positive difference in that respect, in a way that people like, say, Elizabeth Warren cannot. That\u2019s why you want good guys on the other side of the partisan divide, no matter how irrelevant they currently appear to be. When Trumpism fails, as it inevitably will, who will be the Republican Adenauer?\n\nI write this as a parallel contest is taking shape within the Democratic Party, most visibly in the rift between traditional liberals and the social-justice warriors of what used to be the far left. Dianne Feinstein\u2019s failure this week to claim her party\u2019s nomination for the Senate seat she\u2019s held since 1992 is another depressing indication that the rift is widening.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne side believes in the power of reason, the possibility of persuasion, and the values of the Enlightenment. It champions social solidarity for the sake of empowering the individual, rather than creating a society of conformists. It doesn\u2019t see compromise as a dirty word. Its belief in the benefits of civility and diversity does not override its commitment to free speech and independent thought.\n\nAs for the other side, it thinks it knows what\u2019s True. It considers compromise knavish. It views debate \u2014 beyond its own tightly set parameters \u2014 as either pointless or dangerous. And while it sees itself as the antithesis of Trumpism, it is, in its raging intolerance and smug self-satisfaction, Trumpism\u2019s mirror image.\n\nMy advice to traditional liberals is not to repeat the establishment Republican mistake of not taking the threat of populist illiberalism seriously, and of not fighting it fiercely. The fabric of an open society is more frayed than most people realize, and it is coming unraveled from more than one end. What happened to the G.O.P. in 2016 could happen to the Democrats in 2020.\n\nThe good news, as Charen courageously reminded us, is that these fights should never be abandoned even when they seem lost, and that sometimes the fights most worth having are those with our own side.

The overall poverty rate remains about the same today as it was 50 years ago; the total number of poor people has increased from over 25 million to well over 40 million, more than the population of California.\n\nMeanwhile, the rich have profited at the expense of most working Americans. Today, the top 1 percent receive 52 percent of all new income. Rich people are healthier and live longer. They get a better education, which produces greater gains in income. And their greater economic power translates into greater political power.\n\nFive Indicators America of the 1960s contrasted with the most recent available data.

Thus, they argue, it violates the First Amendment for the objectors to have to support the union in any way, and therefore the precedent, Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, must be overruled.\n\nIn support of this argument, Justices Alito and Kennedy were obsessively focused on unions as political actors that could, in Justice Alito\u2019s words, \u201cpush a city to the brink and perhaps over the brink into bankruptcy.\u201d Their goal was to show that public employee unions are political to their very core.\n\n\u201cDo you think that this case affects the political influence of the unions?\u201d Justice Kennedy asked Mr. Frederick.

But Mr. Frederick is not only a member of the Supreme Court bar\u2019s elite inner circle \u2014 a position once shared by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. \u2014 but also the author of a how-to book, \u201cSupreme Court and Appellate Advocacy,\u201d widely regarded as a kind of bible on the subject. In the book, originally published in 2003 and now in a second edition, he describes the \u201cnimbleness in maintaining focus\u201d that\u2019s necessary for \u201cfending off hostile questions that threaten to undermine the case.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo Justice Kennedy\u2019s \u201cgotcha\u201d question, he replied coolly, \u201cIt is not the end of the case, Your Honor, because that is not the question.\u201d To Justice Alito\u2019s dystopian vision of unions pushing cities into bankruptcy, he said, \u201cI would say \u2014 and there are briefs on our side that make this very clear \u2014 that that particular hypothetical, in fact, is an unfair smearing of the collective bargaining process.\u201d\n\nThen there was a colloquy with Justice Alito, who asked what the consequences would be if a state labor law included lobbying as part of the union\u2019s collective bargaining activities, thus making its lobbying expenses chargeable to nonmembers.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018lobbying,\u2019 Justice Alito?\u201d Mr. Frederick asked.\n\nJustice Alito: \u201cWell, is there any limit on what states can make a mandatory subject of collective bargaining? So if the test is whether it\u2019s mandated by the state, the state can make anything it wants a mandatory subject of bargaining.\u201d\n\nMr. Frederick pushed back to a degree not often seen in the courtroom: \u201cJustice Alito, I would say that that hypothetical is so far outside of what this case is really all about that if you think that there\u2019s a problem, that if any state ever in the Union would come up with some requirement like that as part of collective bargaining, you have the opportunity to review it at this time.\u201d It was the lawyer\u2019s way of saying: You know what you\u2019re going to do, and so do I, and I can\u2019t stop you but I\u2019m not going to play this game with you.\n\nTrying to understand the unseemly anger radiating from the bench, I came up with two theories. Under one theory, the anti-union justices are simply angry at having to go through this exercise again when they came so close two years ago, with victory snatched from them by Justice Scalia\u2019s death.\n\nIn my second theory, these justices are responding to accounts in the press and elsewhere of the intensely political nature of this case, financed by right-wing donors who have spent years looking for an opportunity to cripple organized labor. A brief filed in the case by two Democratic senators, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, is unusually explicit in recounting how \u201cthis case is not only bizarre in its procedural history, it is part of a broader special-interest campaign spanning multiple cases that departs from the ordinary course of litigation in multiple ways.\u201d\n\nThis remarkable brief reproduces a fund-raising letter from one group, the Freedom Foundation, which proclaims that thanks to this case and specifically to the arrival of Justice Gorsuch, \u201cThe Supreme Court is about to hand us the opportunity of a lifetime.\u201d The letter adds that \u201cwe\u2019ve been pointing toward this moment for our entire existence\u201d and asks for financial help \u201cto take advantage of the expected 5-4 decision for freedom.\u201d The two senators \u2014 one of whom, Senator Blumenthal, was once a Supreme Court law clerk \u2014 tell the justices that \u201cthese bold predictions, which can only taint the court\u2019s institutional standing, surely must disconcert any member of the public who cares about the judiciary\u2019s impartiality.\u201d\n\nConfronted with such briefs and articles, some judges might pull back and think twice about overturning a 40-year-old precedent for reasons so obviously grounded in policy rather than law. But if the effort was to shame the five justices who now hold the upper hand, I think it most likely backfired. The voice that came through to me was one that said: \u201cOh, yeah? Save your breath. We\u2019ve got the votes and \u2014 in case you\u2019ve forgotten \u2014 life tenure besides.\u201d", "keywords": ["labor", "supreme", "justice", "unions", "kennedy", "court", "political", "power", "courts", "alito", "case", "justices", "play", "frederick"], "polarity": 0.04908820346320347, "subjectivity": 0.3705733557378295},

I\u2019d love to jump right in and hear your aspirations for Prairie View. What do you hope to accomplish in your time as president? I assume you had many offers to lead other colleges. Why was Prairie View different?\n\nRuth Simmons: Well, I\u2019m a native of Texas, and one of the things that I did when I returned to Houston after I retired from Brown was think about the ways I could use my experience to help the community. I started with small ventures in the city, but I hadn\u2019t thought really that another university would be in my life. But when I was approached by Prairie View, I thought immediately about its significant impact on my brother, who went there. And what Dillard did for me.\n\nI grew up in a segregated neighborhood in Grapeland, Tex., with very little experience with the world. The transition that Dillard enabled for me was extremely valuable. As an undergraduate, I began to grow a sense of confidence that helped me move from a fairly insular environment to a bigger stage when I went to graduate school.\n\nMy aspirations for Prairie View are to essentially make sure the university is continuing to do the same thing for students today that it did for my brother \u2014 and Dillard did for me. And that is to offer the advantage of a strong education that will prepare students for the careers they want, in a social and cultural context that helps them develop the confidence to perform after graduation.\n\nAs president, that means focusing on time-honored strategies to success that apply to universities everywhere: worrying about the faculty who are recruited here, the campus experience, and whether we are providing the leadership and internship opportunities that students need. It means worrying about the reputation of the university. It\u2019s obviously a much more competitive world today than it was when I was a student, but the underlying work to move the university to a level of achievement that makes students and alumni proud is the same.\n\nM.J.: What do you see as some of the major challenges facing historically black colleges and universities?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: The general challenge for H.B.C.U.s is not unlike the problem many universities face today, and that is the financial model. Being tuition dependent has become a large problem for all universities. H.B.C.U.s are dependent on raising money, but that is a reality that most universities obviously face. So it very much depends on the question of whether the schools have a good-enough foundation because of secure financing. When it comes to the federal government\u2019s role in supporting H.B.C.U.s, I think we don\u2019t yet understand the extent to which they will be affected by the changes in Washington today. To say that many are not hopeful in this moment is an understatement. We just don\u2019t know.\n\nFrankly, that\u2019s why I advocate for developing enough financial independence to secure the future of our institutions. That means looking for different revenue streams, looking to increase our ability to raise funds and finding alternate programs that help to bring more income into our university. The only strategy cannot be to persistently raise tuition, making college outside the reach of many families.\n\nM.J.: You\u2019ve led several institutions that are all very different from each other, and the topic of leadership is something you\u2019ve talked a lot about. In another interview with The Times you said that it\u2019s much easier to lead people \u201cif you convey the underlying principles.\u201d Can you elaborate?\n\nR.S.: One thing that I\u2019ve learned is that the perceptions of what it takes to be a leader are often based on prototypical models that don\u2019t have much truth in reality. People look at the institutions that I have led and they see dissimilarities. I see similarities. When people think in terms of leadership, they\u2019re often thinking about the kind of specific skills needed for different types of enterprises. I think of leadership as more of a disposition \u2014 the ability to step into a situation to learn about the history of the enterprise, the opportunities that it faces, the culture that exists and the people who are served by it. To look at all of that, to listen to stakeholders and then to think about how that enterprise or institution should best be served. There is no one model of leadership if you approach it that way. What I have tried to do wherever I go is to start where the institution is rather than try to import particularly rigid constructs from other places. In that sense, I think a leader is more than anything else a facilitator. A person who is able to come in to show a community a picture of what it is, to provide some insight into what it could be \u2014 how it could be different or improved perhaps \u2014 and then enlist the help of people who are there and others who support that institution in order to move forward together.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nI don\u2019t subscribe to the model of hero leadership, which is identifying somebody who can come in and have magical powers and then wield the wand and fix things that have not been fixable before. I don\u2019t see that. I think leadership is a community affair.\n\nM.J.: That makes sense. So how do you approach educating the current generation of students at Prairie View to lead in the way you described?\n\nR.S.: People today are fond of leadership programs that theorize about the profile and tenets of leadership. And students anxiously get involved in those programs. I rather think that our entire campuses are incubators of leadership even without the formality of such programs because if we\u2019re doing what we should be doing, we are acclimating students to an environment in which they have to learn to work with others who are very different from themselves. And that seems to me to be the first requirement of leadership. To actually learn to work with people in a respectful and inclusive way is inordinately important. A campus provides one of the best opportunities for people to be able to do that because you sit in class alongside people whom you initially don\u2019t know. You are discussing your ideas, having people respond to them and often rejecting what you\u2019re saying. You are joining organizations that have certain aims that are being advanced by the collective, so you\u2019re learning how to facilitate. You are asked to step into leadership roles either through student government or organizations. Even in the classroom context you might play a leadership role. You have to learn to express yourself, to be convincing, to write out your ideas, to be more thoughtful than you\u2019d ordinarily be. All of those things are components of leadership.\n\nM.J.: Some would argue that social media, or perhaps disagreements over the concept of safe spaces, have made it more challenging for people to come together and to work together.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: Yeah, I would say that people frequently say that, but that has certainly not been my experience. I would say that in my days as a student, the tensions were higher, the disagreements were greater, the separation among us was certainly more pronounced. And people are kind of inventing a new narrative, that things are so much worse today than they were in the past. I don\u2019t buy that. I think we have new terminology, because the modern sciences of psychology and sociology and so forth and modern media have enabled us to peer into areas that we were not able to see as easily as before. And so when you have social media and all of the ways in which people can now say whatever they want to say \u2014 in an unartful or offensive way \u2014 that turns the volume up to be sure. But it doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t there before.\n\nI would say that the current situation ought to give us much more practice in how to engage with each other because it is not underground. It\u2019s out front, it\u2019s in the open. The media today and the things that are being reported should be upsetting or troubling to students, my goodness. But it may be an even better opportunity to engage students.\n\nAs a teacher, as an educator, I would say these times are especially fertile for teaching the skills that are needed in a world in which there are many types of people, many perspectives and so forth. Students don\u2019t need to feel silenced by the current situation. When students at Brown came to me and said, you know, they were hurt because somebody asked them about their hair, and they were tired of that and they didn\u2019t want any part of it, I would say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s just too bad!\u201d Somebody asked you about your hair, tell them about your hair. You are in college not to hide from that. You\u2019re there to teach the world about yourself, you\u2019re there to learn about others and to teach them about who you are. So I\u2019d rather think this whole notion of protecting people from that is something that we have to take in hand and deal with. And help students see the opportunity in that because if they engage with people who have those kinds of perspectives, they are going to be much stronger in the end than if they run away.\n\nM.J.: Do you see the situation differently for students at H.B.C.U.s? You mentioned that Dillard gave you the space to learn and build confidence before heading to graduate school.\n\nR.S.: There is a narrative that many people have for H.B.C.U.s. People see them as a monolith, or only see them as filling a gap that exists for African-Americans. H.B.C.U.s are not a brand. They are institutions with a certain history \u2014 they were originally set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for education \u2014 but they are not all alike, and are very diverse in what they offer.\n\nPrairie View, for example, is the second-oldest public institution of higher education in the state of Texas. It was set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for ex-slaves and whites. For a long time it provided educational opportunities for black students that wouldn\u2019t have been open to them otherwise. In nursing, architecture, engineering and other STEM fields at a time when many blacks were not able to go into those areas, the university was able to facilitate the entry of blacks into those professions.\n\nM.J.: Yes, this is something that Nikole Hannah-Jones has written about for The New York Times Magazine, in particular how Xavier University of Louisiana sends more black students to medical school than almost any other college in the country. I read that Prairie View has many more students who graduate with degrees in architecture and engineering.\n\nR.S.: Yes, going to Dillard is not like going to Prairie View. So the student who chooses to go to one H.B.C.U. may not find another appealing. That has to do with the unique features of the place, the academic culture and so on, the traditions. All of that makes a big difference.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen I went off to college, I was just trying to find a place where I could be a student without impediments that in that day and time were fairly widely known to be substantial if you enrolled in a majority-white institution. There was no question that in 1963, if you went off to college in the South, you had to be very careful about where you studied. The racial dynamic was very challenging at that time. One of the things I\u2019m learning now is that many of the students I speak to at Prairie View today have the same kinds of thoughts that I had those many years ago. They ask themselves, where can I feel comfortable so that I don\u2019t have to worry about anything but my academic work? So certainly that plays a factor in why students apply to H.B.C.U.s. And for some H.B.C.U.s, applications are way up. But if you reach the point where you think that a category of institutions are the right choice for you \u2014 going to an H.B.C.U. just to go to an H.B.C.U. \u2014 then you\u2019re not thinking broadly enough.\n\nM.J.: As you look across the landscape of higher education, what other challenges do college students face today?\n\nR.S.: I guess I worry a lot about our students having the skills and the experience to promote respectful interactions with a wide-ranging group of people. Students can be quite passionate about what they see on the national scene and how sometimes dangerous they think it is \u2014 how unpleasant it is and so forth. But we\u2019ve got to try to find a way on our campuses not to taint the national picture as hopeless, or as being antithetical to anything that we can think of as good and admirable. The last thing we want is for our students to bow out and decide that it isn\u2019t worth trying to do anything about a hopeless situation.\n\nAnd I do think that civility goes hand in hand with being hopeful. Hopeful that the next person you meet you will be able to converse with you in a respectful way. Hopeful that the next election cycle is going to give you a chance to be engaged and able to do something that makes you feel a sense of your own agency. Hopeful that the things will get better rather than worse.\n\nSo much of what we have to do on our campuses is really to hold open the possibility for people that civil society will in the end right itself \u2014 if enough of us are engaged. I am so thankful every day for the fact that I grew up in a time when nobody thought blacks would be able to be integrated into American society, they would never be able to hold important positions, they\u2019d never be respected intellectually, they\u2019d never be able to do the things that they are now able to do. So why did we persist? And why did we continue to work toward betterment? We did it because we had people working with us in education who were ever hopeful that things were going to change. So I like to say to educators, you have to be always projecting to students that civility enables hopefulness to be ever resurgent.", "keywords": ["prairie", "simmons", "today", "generation", "think", "view", "cultivating", "dont", "ruth", "things", "say", "leadership", "able", "college", "students"], "polarity": 0.18839701321015756, "subjectivity": 0.47766767453623127},

Fred Harris is the second person to the right of Kerner. Underwood Archives/Getty Images\n\n\u201cOur nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white \u2013 separate and unequal.\u201d\n\nFifty years ago, on March 1, 1968, these were the grim words of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, called the Kerner Commission after its chairman, Gov. Otto Kerner of Illinois.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson had established the commission to examine the disorders and violent protests in Detroit, Newark and well over 100 other American cities during the summer of 1967, and earlier. What it found was searing. \u201cWhat white Americans have never fully understood \u2013 but what the Negro can never forget \u2013 is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto,\u201d the commission concluded. \u201cWhite institutions created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it.\u201d\n\nMostly moderate and mostly white men, the members of the bipartisan panel carried the imprimatur of the political establishment. Their recommendations attracted widespread public debate. The paperback edition of the report sold over two million copies.\n\nOccupied by the Vietnam War and concerned about the legacy of his Great Society domestic agenda, Johnson distanced himself from the \u201ctwo societies\u201d warning. But the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Robert Kennedy strongly endorsed the commission\u2019s findings and recommendations before they were assassinated and before more protests erupted during that traumatic year of 1968.\n\nThe Kerner Commission recommended \u201cmassive and sustained\u201d investments in jobs and education to reduce poverty, inequality and racial injustice. Have we made progress in the last 50 years?\n\nA Return to Segregation\n\nIn many ways, things have gotten no better \u2014 or have gotten worse \u2014 since 1968.

The overall poverty rate remains about the same today as it was 50 years ago; the total number of poor people has increased from over 25 million to well over 40 million, more than the population of California.\n\nMeanwhile, the rich have profited at the expense of most working Americans. Today, the top 1 percent receive 52 percent of all new income. Rich people are healthier and live longer. They get a better education, which produces greater gains in income. And their greater economic power translates into greater political power.\n\nFive Indicators America of the 1960s contrasted with the most recent available data.

They are quiet, almost too much so. But once you learn what happened in these scenes from small towns, big cities or verdant fields, their almost unemotional first impression gives way to horror: Someone was lynched there.\n\nStarting in 2016, Mr. Clasper traveled through the United States seeking the sites of lynchings. He wanted to show how places that call no attention to themselves were the sites of hangings, slashings or execution by gunfire. In the course of covering 24 sites, they span 150 years, right up to the present century, and range from the American south to New York City.\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective, I take it back to 1903, when the American scholar and activist W.E.B. Du Bois said the problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line,\u201d Mr. Clasper said. \u201cIt seems to me not a lot has changed despite significant advances. There has been barely a year or generation that has passed where racism and violence have not been at the forefront of the American experience.\u201d\n\nAs the London-born son of a British mother and American father, Mr. Clasper said he had \u201ca deep spiritual connection to the American landscape.\u201d In this series \u2014 titled \u201cThe Spaces We Inherit\u201d \u2014 he hopes to gently confront viewers in a way that eschews graphic images of violence.\n\n\u201cI took a different approach and focused on the spaces to encourage people to look at this history from an altered perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve become desensitized to images of violence. But everything that happen s has to happen somewhere.\u201d\n\nGiven the persisting tensions over racial and religious prejudice, Mr. Clasper wants to gently provoke a necessary conversation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to investigate these deep-seated issues in America,\u201d he said. \u201cI think many agree that the nation has not dealt with its bloody past of lynchings and segregation. It seemed to me there has been no collective acceptance, let alone recognition of the mistakes made and the sins committed.\u201d\n\nInterviews were conducted by Oliver Clasper and have been edited for brevity.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Jesse Lee Bond, Arlington, Tenn., 1939\n\nOn April 28, 1939, a local sharecropper named Jesse Lee Bond was shot to death in broad daylight by employees of SY Wilson, a local hardware store. Jesse Lee Bond had asked for an invoice the day before after purchasing goods on credit, something that was no\u0095t done by African-Americans at that time as keeping sharecroppers in the dark about how much they had spent was one way for white owners to keep their workers in constant debt. The day of Jesse Lee Bond\u2019s murder he was ordered back to the store. His aunt accompanied him and witnessed the whole thing. \u201cThey shot at him and shot him. He ran out to the outhouse. They riddled the outhouse. And when he staggered out of the outhouse, they threw him down, castrated him, and dragged him to the river,\u0095\u201d she said. The family was told he had drowned accidentally.\n\nImage\n\nSylvester Lewis, Memphis\n\n\u201cI remember my cousin Jesse well. I was 9 when he was killed and he was 20. What I heard was that there had been a dispute at the SY Wilson general store over in Arlington. Jesse insisted on a receipt, but this is something they didn\u2019\u0095t do. I think whoever he was negotiating with relented, but I think the people over him, the father of the individual in question, didn\u2019\u0095t like it. They went to his home and said they wanted to talk to him and ordered him back to the store. When he returned they attacked him. He tried to run for his life but they caught up with him and shot him. I also heard that they dragged his body behind a vehicle and then dumped him in the river. The descendants are running the store now, and I\u2019\u0095m not sure they know what happened. The ones who were allegedly involved in the lynching passed a long time ago, but their relations are still in Arlington. I don\u2019t think there\u2019\u0095s any resentment now. Anyone who hears about it can\u2019\u0095t understand how that could happen. They simply can\u2019t relate to that kind of criminal activity.\u201d\n\nInterviewed November 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Emmett Till, Drew, Miss., 1955.\n\nIn what is one of the most significant race-related events in the history of the United States, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Chicago native, was brutally lynched in rural Mississippi on Aug. 28, 1955. Till, who had been visiting family members in the area, entered a local white-owned grocery store in the town of Money for less than one minute. Whatever was said between him and the proprietor, Carolyn Bryant, was used as the pretext for his murder. Four days later Till was abducted from his uncle\u2019\u0095s house by Roy Bryant, Carolyn\u2019\u0095s husband, and J.W. Milam and driven to a nearby barn where he was severely beaten and tortured (the original wall of the barn can be seen on the left of the photograph). He was then taken to the Tallahatchie River, shot in the head, and drowned with a cotton gin fan tied around his neck. In an infamous court case both defendants were found \u0094not guilty\u0095 by an all-white jury. Months later they sold their story and admitted their guilt, with Bryant claiming that the Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education that desegregated schools was a mistake. Emmett Till\u2019s mother, Mamie Till Bradley, allowed photos to be taken of her son\u2019s broken and swollen body because she \u201cwanted the world to see what they did to my baby.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nDr. Jeffrey Andrews, Drew, Miss.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know the history of the property when I purchased it in 2003 and it was only two years later that a few local people told me of the Emmett Till murder. I\u2019ve lived in Drew since I was 12 and I had never heard of it. I\u2019ve since modified the barn to make it more functional and useful, and someone once asked me why I would change a historical site, but history is in the past and people should move on. Things have changed drastically here in the Mississippi Delta region and race relations are at all-time high. History is an important learning tool and it should be used to help people move forward, but one thing you have to remember is that people here don\u2019t want to be constantly reminded of how things were 60 years ago. We\u2019ve all moved forward, and sometimes people aren\u2019t given enough credit for the changes we\u2019ve made. I respect everyone\u2019s feelings towards Emmett Till, and I\u2019ve met some of his family members. They\u2019re great people. This has been a learning experience for my family and we appreciate the fact that we\u2019re part of a historical site.\u201d\n\nInterviewed March 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Joe Coe, Omaha, 1891\n\nOn Oct. 10, 1891, a 50-year-old African-American named Joe Coe (also known as George Smith) was accused of sexually assaulting a 5-year-old girl and was quickly arrested. Rumors spread that the girl had died and that Coe would get off lightly, neither of which was true. A frenzied mob seized him from the jail at the Douglas County Courthouse, put a rope around his neck, and dragged his body through the streets. Coe was then hanged from a streetcar wire on the corner of 17th and Harney in front of thousands of onlookers. Souvenirs of the rope were later sold. Mayor Richard C. Cushing of Omaha condemned the lynching as \u201c\u0094the most deplorable thing that has ever happened in the history of the country.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Ell Persons, Memphis, 1917\n\nWhen the decapitated body of a 16-year-old local, Antoinette Rappel, was found near the old Wolf River Bridge in May 1917, Ell Persons, a local black woodcutter, was deemed a possible suspect. Despite being arrested and released twice, he was captured a third time and forced to confess. A local mob announced that he was to be lynched the next day. The news spread, and a crowd of 3,000 turned up to witness his lynching (including students of Central High School). Ell Persons was burned on a makeshift pyre in a carnival-like atmosphere. He was then decapitated, and his head was taken to the predominantly African-American Beale Street and thrown at locals. A century later his lynching was commemorated and a historic marker was erected near the site.\n\nImage\n\nAmal Altareb, Memphis\n\n\u201cI came to America in 2012 from Yemen. I\u2019m still learning the language and the history, and it wasn\u2019t until the spring of last year that I learned about lynchings. I knew some of the history of segregation and Jim Crow laws, and I knew how unfair the system was \u2014 that African-Americans weren\u2019t treated as equals \u2014 but I didn\u2019t know that human beings had been burned or hanged from a tree just because of their race. Last year my class at Central High School were discussing it and I asked what lynchings were and they were surprised that I didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s surprising that humans can go so far as to kill someone else in this way and create a festival-like atmosphere. There were even spectators. Uncovering the truth is painful, but it\u2019s important. The African-American students especially don\u2019t talk about it because it\u2019s painful, and it reminds them of the injustices towards their race. White Americans don\u2019t want to remember either because of the guilt they feel. I can understand why people want to avoid the topic, but we need to face history in order to move forward.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Leo Frank, Marietta, Ga., 1915\n\nMary Phagan, 13, was found dead on April 26, 1913, at a National Pencil Company factory where she worked. Amid an atmosphere of anti-Semitism and despite conflicting evidence, a Jewish superintendent named Leo Frank was convicted of the crime. Frank\u2019s sentence was later commuted from the death penalty to life imprisonment, a decision that led a mob on Aug. 17, 1915, to seize him from state prison and lynch him from a tree in Marietta, Mary Phagan\u2019s hometown. Later that year the second chapter of the Ku Klux Klan was founded on Stone Mountain, with a number of Leo Frank\u2019s murderers present. Leo Frank was posthumously pardoned in 1986.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of George W. Murray, Mae Murray Dorsey, Roger Malcom and Dorothy Malcolm, Walton County, Georgia, 1946\n\nAfter Roger Malcom, a World War II veteran and Georgia sharecropper, had been bailed out of jail after allegedly stabbing a white man, members of the local community decided to take revenge. On July 25, 1946, a mob of 15 to 20 stopped the car Malcom was riding in with his wife, Dorothy, and another couple, George W. Murray and Mae Murray Dorsey, who was pregnant. They tied the four of them to a nearby tree and shot them to death. Mae Murray Dorsey then had her unborn baby ripped out of her. Despite an F.B.I. investigation nobody was brought to trial for the crime, and a few months later a grand jury was \u201cunable to establish the identity of any persons guilty of violating the civil rights statute of the United States.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nCeleste Butler, Omaha\n\n\u201cTracing one\u2019s roots and one\u2019s history is hard, especially as an African-American. These are big questions we all want to know: Who are we and where do we come from? I had DNA testing done recently but it didn\u2019t lead anywhere. It just told me that my ancestors came from West Africa, but it couldn\u2019t say where exactly. Missing that part and not being able to hand it down to my children or grandchildren is frustrating. On top of that you hear some people in this country telling black people to \u2018go back home.\u2019 Home to what? Home to whom? It feels like a total assault both mentally and physically to have chapters and generations missing. Not being able to fill that void is difficult. When it comes to racial violence I feel like we\u2019re constantly suffering from PTSD. It\u2019s a stress that never really goes away. A lot of people suffer in pain and in silence, and they suffer for successive generations. Everything was stripped from us, and we\u2019ve been struggling to put the pieces back together ever since.\u201d\n\nInterviewed September 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Michael Donald, Mobile, Ala., 1981\n\nMichael Donald, 19, was abducted on March 21, 1981, by Henry Hays and James Knowles as he was walking home. They beat him, slit his throat, and hanged his body from a tree outside 114 Herndon Avenue. The pretext for Donald\u2019s murder was a \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict handed down by a partially black jury to an African-American man accused of killing a white police officer. This incensed the Alabama chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, led by Benny Jack Hays, the father of Henry Hays, who suggested killing a random black person in response. Michael Donald\u2019s mother, Beulah Mae Donald, with the help of the Southern Poverty Law Center, brought a case not just against the killers but also the United Klans of America. Beulah Mae Donald won the case and received $7 million in damages, essentially bankrupting the U.K.A. Henry Hays was executed, while Knowles received life imprisonment. Hays is the only known Klan member to have been executed in the 20th century for the murder of an African-American. Herndon Avenue has since been renamed Michael Donald Avenue and a historic marker has been erected.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Mulugeta Seraw, Portland, Ore., 1988\n\nOn the evening of Nov. 13, 1988, an Ethiopian student named Mulugeta Seraw was being dropped off at his apartment when he was attacked by Kenneth Mieske, Kyle Brewster and Steve Strasser, members of a local racist skinhead group called East Side White Pride. Mieske delivered the fatal blows with a baseball bat. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 1990 Seraw\u2019s family, represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, brought a civil lawsuit against the killers\u2019 affiliated group, the White Aryan Nation, and its leaders, Tom and John Metzger, for $12.5 million. Tom Metzger later said that the killers had done their \u201ccivic duty\u201d by killing Seraw.\n\nImage\n\nJason Downard, Portland, Ore.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 2 I was put into foster care, and in 2009 I went to prison for a gang-affiliated drive-by shooting. I didn\u2019t grow up racist, but in prison the racist skinheads pulled me into their group and drilled stuff into my head about how the media is run by Jews and that they wanted an all-white nation. I also got a tattoo of a swastika on my leg, which I\u2019ve since had covered up. It\u2019s a painful reminder. The skinheads showed me support and love and compassion, which I hadn\u2019t experienced before in my life; everyone is looking for some kind of acceptance. I was angry and uncomfortable with who I was, and I drove that anger towards people who didn\u2019t look like me. In the last two years of the movement my sister had a son with a black guy and my nephew would give me this look like he knew what I was about. I started to get a guilty conscience and began to think about the things I thought I believed in. My sister said I\u2019d been brainwashed, and I can see why. The movement just taught me to hate and reinforced those views. The problem of racism in this country is much deeper than many people think. When it comes to Trump, he\u2019s tacitly endorsed the alt-right and white supremacists. It\u2019s been a ripple effect and things have gotten worse since he came into power. The right now feel emboldened. I look back now at some of the things I\u2019ve done and I realize that I\u2019ve hurt a lot of people. I decided I wanted to help others who had been in a similar position to me, and that\u2019s been my mission ever since. Now I work for an organization called Life After Hate. I\u2019m a marked man, and maybe I\u2019ll die doing this, but at least I\u2019ll die knowing I did the right thing.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Murder Site of Timothy Caughman, New York City, 2017\n\nOn March 17, 2017 James Harris Jackson traveled from his home in Baltimore to New York City with the intention of killing random black men. The reason, he later told police, was his hatred of interracial relationships. Three days later he found Timothy Caughman, 66, collecting cans in a trash bin on the corner of West 36th and 9th Avenue and stabbed him multiple times with an 18-inch sword. Caughman died of his injuries that night, and two days later Jackson turned himself in, telling police that he had planned to kill more black men in Times Square. On March 27, Jackson was charged with one count each of murder in the first and second degrees as an act of terrorism, second-degree murder as a hate crime, and three counts of criminal possession of a weapon.\n\n\u201cThe Spaces We Inherit,\u201d which will be published as a book by Overlapse in October 2018, is available for pre-order.\n\nFollow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

In a detailed 101-page opinion, the judge rejected a challenge by the State of California and several environmental groups to the administration\u2019s waiver of environmental laws that could have held up the wall\u2019s construction.\n\n\u201cBig legal win today,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted around 11:30. \u201cU.S. judge sided with the Trump Administration and rejected the attempt to stop the government from building a great Border Wall on the Southern Border. Now this important project can go forward!\u201d\n\nSo far so good. Mr. Trump is entitled, no less than other presidents, to celebrate his administration\u2019s victories in court \u2014 even if he does so in a bathrobe. What he failed to mention, though, was the name of the judge who issued the ruling: Gonzalo Curiel, of the Southern District of California.\n\nJudge Curiel, you may recall, was on Mr. Trump\u2019s radar in May 2016, soon after Mr. Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee for president. At the time, Judge Curiel was presiding over a long-running class-action lawsuit against Trump University, which had been accused of defrauding customers who spent $1,500 for three-day seminars that promised to reveal Mr. Trump\u2019s real estate secrets.\n\nMr. Trump, who refuses to be held to account for anything he has ever said or done, was irked that a federal judge would dare to entertain litigation against him. At a rally in San Diego, Mr. Trump called Judge Curiel \u201cvery hostile,\u201d \u201ca very bad judge\u201d and a \u201chater of Donald Trump,\u201d and said he \u201cshould be ashamed of himself. I think it\u2019s a disgrace that he\u2019s doing this.\u201d\n\nHe added that Judge Curiel \u201chappens to be, we believe, Mexican.\u201d Not true: Judge Curiel was born and raised in Indiana. But the implication, of course, was that Mr. Trump, who had begun his own candidacy with derogatory comments about Mexicans and had been pushing a border wall with Mexico throughout the campaign, could not get a fair trial from a \u201cMexican\u201d judge.\n\nLess than two years later, in a case involving the border wall itself, that same judge ruled in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor. He is no longer a \u201cvery bad judge,\u201d apparently.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Mr. Trump simply forgot who Judge Curiel is. More likely, he knows full well and doesn\u2019t care. What he cares about is protecting his delicate ego, and repairing any damage to it inflicted by people who don\u2019t show a sufficient degree of respect or self-abasement. This all-consuming self-interest leads him to change his opinion of people and institutions, depending on how he thinks they are treating him at that moment.\n\nLaws and norms, ethics and principles? Meaningless concepts. In Mr. Trump\u2019s world, nothing is sacred and everything is transactional. This is a man who is so much more interested in winning than in governing that he filed for re-election the same day he was inaugurated. It\u2019s the core of who he is, as almost anyone who has had even a glancing dealing with him over the years \u2014 especially in real estate, where nothing matters but the sale \u2014 will attest. If you help him or say nice things about him, you\u2019re the best. If you get in his way or criticize him, you\u2019re unfair, dishonest, terrible. Failing, even.\n\nAsk \u201cLiddle\u201d Bob Corker, the Tennessee senator who earned Mr. Trump\u2019s outrage by criticizing the Republican tax bill, then seemed to get back on the president\u2019s good side with a few empathetic words. Or Senator John McCain, who is dealing with terminal brain cancer even as Mr. Trump keeps mocking him for his vote last year against repealing Obamacare. Or Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s first and most ardent supporter in the Senate, but who has secured a spot in the president\u2019s doghouse after recusing himself from the Russia investigation. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump fired yet another broadside at Mr. Sessions, complaining that his failure to investigate alleged abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is \u201cdisgraceful\u201d \u2014 in all caps, naturally.\n\nNone of this is remotely surprising anymore, but even so, Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet about Judge Curiel\u2019s border-wall decision revealed once again the depths of the president\u2019s own self-interest and his utter lack of principles. When this is the driving force of the commander in chief, and it is aimed at our governmental and social institutions, it is profoundly destructive.\n\nShortly after the 2016 rally where he disparaged the competence, integrity and ethnicity of Judge Curiel, Mr. Trump was asked why he did not just settle the Trump University case and be done with it. After predicting that he would win outright, he said: \u201cI could settle that case. \u2026 I don\u2019t want to settle the case. Because you know what? Because I\u2019m a man of principle.\u201d (In November 2016, days after he won the election, Mr. Trump settled, eventually paying $25 million.)\n\nFortunately, as this tale reveals, there are in fact still people of principle in public service, and they\u2019re doing important work every day to preserve our institutions and counteract this president\u2019s worst impulses.\n\nJudge Curiel, for one, has continued to do his job, carefully applying the law to the cases that come before him, no matter how obnoxious the litigants might be. In his ruling on Tuesday, the judge acknowledged the \u201cheated political debate\u201d surrounding the border wall, and quoted a passage on the role of courts by Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. \u2014 who, he slyly noted, is a \u201cfellow Indiana native\u201d: \u201cCourts are vested with the authority to interpret the law; we possess neither the expertise nor the prerogative to make policy judgments. Those decisions are entrusted to our nation\u2019s elected leaders, who can be thrown out of office if the people disagree with them. It is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices.\u201d\n\nThat is what being a public servant in America sounds like, and it requires a level of selflessness and devotion to democratic ideals that is alien to Mr. Trump.\n\nOrder Reprints | Today\u2019s Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A 26 of the New York edition with the headline: Mr. Trump and the \u2018Very Bad Judge\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["border", "donald", "mr", "wall", "presidents", "gets", "bad", "judge", "opinion", "trump", "case", "trumps", "lesson", "curiel"], "polarity": 0.048137140637140655, "subjectivity": 0.4841242091242094},

Zinke has bid adieu to five-sixths of the unpaid members of the National Park System Advisory Board \u2014 although it\u2019s not actually clear that Zinke knows they\u2019re gone, since he refused to meet with them.\n\n\u201cIt is SO tough to pick one,\u201d moaned a voter torn between Pruitt and Zinke.\n\nBoth men seem to have a particular obsession with flying in style. Pruitt\u2019s round-the-clock security detail has conveniently decided that it\u2019s dangerous for him to sit in coach. Their concern for the dangers he might encounter crammed in with the rank-and-file was so intense that Pruitt felt compelled to spend $1,641 of public money to sit up front on an exhausting one-hour flight from Washington to New York.\n\nWhat is it with these people and travel?\n\nYou\u2019ll remember at one point Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin tried to get a government plane for his honeymoon. The first head of Health and Human Services was canned because of his penchant for high-end transport. But Pruitt, unfazed, is still being spotted in first-class seating.\n\nWe the taxpayers paid for a $36,000 military flight to get Pruitt from Cincinnati to New York on one occasion when he felt particularly pressed for time. The trip was to promote infrastructure improvements, and the money the government spent just getting Pruitt out of Ohio could have paid for paving cracks in approximately 110 square miles of road.\n\nPruitt needs special seating, the E.P.A. claims, because other travelers have begun to verbally assault him in the airports. On the one side we have a guy accompanied by guards, in an enclosed space inhabited only by people who have walked through metal detectors.

Though his inquiry is intensely, at times painfully personal, Mr. Wilkerson is above all concerned with unpacking the mechanisms of racial domination. The procedure is akin to performing surgery on a half-conscious subject, or digging up a buried land mine that has lost little of its explosive power.\n\nVideo\n\nThe focus of his excavation is a killing that took place in Dothan, Ala., in 1946, when S.E. Branch, a white shopkeeper, shot Bill Spann, a black man who was in his store. Branch, Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s great-grandfather, was charged with first-degree murder, but no trial was ever held, and the crime faded from memory. Or rather, the memory of it was quietly and systematically suppressed. All that remains are a short newspaper article and a few photographs and home movies of the killer.\n\n\u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d proceeds on several parallel tracks. Mr. Wilkerson returns to Alabama and tries to discover both how Bill Spann died and how he was forgotten. His investigation, accompanied by haunting images of Southern back roads and quiet houses, is punctuated by reminders that Bill Spann\u2019s death is hardly a unique or anomalous event. The names of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and other recent victims of racist violence appear onscreen, and two songs of protest loop into the soundtrack: Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s \u201cHell You Talmbout\u201d and Phil Ochs\u2019s \u201cWilliam Moore.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat song, about a white postal worker and civil rights activist murdered on an Alabama highway in 1963, is the source of the film\u2019s title and a part of its wider cultural context. \u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d is a passionately political film, aflame with rage in spite of its director\u2019s measured, ruminative tone of voice. It is also a horror movie, full of specters and silences and a terror that is pervasive, intimate and elusive.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Wilkerson, whose previous films include \u201cAn Injury to One\u201d and \u201cFar From Afghanistan,\u201d dispenses with many of the usual techniques of historical documentary. There are a few on-camera interviews, with neighbors and relatives, but more frequently Mr. Wilkerson narrates encounters that took place off camera. And his sleuthing often leads not to moments of revelation but to dead ends and deeper mysteries. The insertion of clips from \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d provides a chilling and ironic counterpoint to the grim story this movie is telling. S.E. Branch is the opposite of Gregory Peck\u2019s brave and decent Atticus Finch, and the truth about what happened to Bill Spann resists the kind of redemptive, healing conclusion that remains a cornerstone of American racial fantasy.\n\nInstead of consolation, Mr. Wilkerson offers commitment. Instead of idealism, honesty. He doesn\u2019t suppose that his film will solve anything, but there is nonetheless something profoundly useful about the way he confronts past and present manifestations of white supremacy. He links his great-grandfather\u2019s crime to the contemporaneous gang rape of Recy Taylor (the subject of an excellent recent documentary by Nancy Buirski), and uncovers patterns of abuse within his family. He corresponds with a relative who is part of a white nationalist, \u201cSouthern secessionist\u201d group. He notes the way racial injustice dwells in apparently mundane facts. The killer is immortalized in pictures and a well-kept tombstone. His victim has been almost entirely erased from memory, a kind of second death beyond the reach of redress or revenge.", "keywords": ["mr", "white", "reckons", "gun", "fired", "racial", "movie", "bill", "wonder", "spann", "wilkerson", "review", "memory", "supremacy"], "polarity": 0.04540441176470589, "subjectivity": 0.3202205882352941},

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/opinion/jared-kushner-conspiracy-fraud.html", "text": "There has already been ample reporting suggesting that Mr. Kushner may have done just that. During a period when Mr. Kushner was negotiating President Trump\u2019s first visit to China, his family business was trying to sell a debt-ridden property in New York to an insurance company with ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Public scrutiny of the deal scuttled it. Last May, The New York Times described how, immediately after the Trump administration extended a visa program for wealthy investors, Mr. Kushner\u2019s sister invoked Mr. Kushner in a presentation seeking Chinese investment in one of the family\u2019s New Jersey real estate developments.\n\nSuch appearances of conflict might not, by themselves, get Mr. Kushner in trouble. The president has broad authority to set the country\u2019s foreign policy, and public corruption laws have been far more difficult to enforce after a 2016 Supreme Court decision overturning the conviction of the former Virginia governor Robert McDonnell on bribery charges.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nBut Mr. Kushner might face more trouble to the extent he keeps such negotiations secret from those in charge of carrying out United States foreign policy. When the national security adviser, H. R. McMaster, learned of some of Mr. Kushner\u2019s communications only after the fact, he was surprised, one official told The Post, and thought it was \u201cweird.\u201d\n\nMr. Kushner has been famously tardy in disclosing his business interests and ties with foreigners in his application for a security clearance. He was still making updates to his forms as recently as January. That means he has conducted an entire year of foreign policy without officially disclosing all the personal interests he may have been serving.\n\nFinally, the risk might be greater still if Mr. Kushner negotiated such deals before Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. That\u2019s the possibility raised by Mr. Kushner\u2019s pre-inauguration meetings with Russia. In December 2016, Mr. Kushner met with Sergey Gorkov, the head of a bank under American sanctions, Vnesheconombank. That meeting came after Mr. Kushner suggested a back channel of communications in a meeting with Russia\u2019s ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, according to Mr. Kislyak.\n\nNor did Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team alert the Obama administration before Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates visited New York in December 2016 for a meeting involving Mr. Kushner and others at Trump Tower.\n\nWhile the proper authorities may not have been informed of this series of meetings, Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser who pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators late last year, did attend or at least knew of them. Steve Bannon, who recently sat for 20 hours of interviews with special counsel prosecutors, participated in the Zayed Trump Tower meeting along with Mr. Flynn and Mr. Kushner. So if they are a concern to Mr. Mueller, he has recently gotten far more details of what happened at the meetings.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Kushner\u2019s defense attorney, Abbe Lowell, has been very forthcoming with the press. But he seems to have relied on the same on-the-record quotation since Feb. 16, when news first broke that Mr. Kushner might lose his interim security clearance. Twelve days ago, a statement from Mr. Lowell to The Washington Post directly addressed the gist of the story that just broke Tuesday. Mr. Kushner\u2019s job, Mr. Lowell said, was \u201cto talk with foreign officials,\u201d which, he added, Mr. Kushner has done \u201cproperly.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Mr. Kushner is just a person who had no idea what he was doing and wanted to improve his and his family\u2019s finances. Still, there are many reasons to question whether he has talked with foreign officials with the proper disclosures, designed to ensure that those claiming to represent the interests of the United States aren\u2019t hiding their own interests or those of foreign governments.\n\nIn pursuing his investigation into Russian tampering, Mr. Mueller appears to be doing something more: restoring the regulatory teeth to ensure that those engaging in American politics are doing what they publicly claim they are.

But it\u2019s also a powerful place, and a friendly one for travelers. Image Scenes from Montgomery. Clockwise from top right: Students examine the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Civil Rights Memorial, designed by Maya Lin; a Nat King Cole mural on Maxwell Boulevard near downtown, by the artists Sunny Paulk and Corey Spearman; culinary students Sheldon Warren, Steven McIntyre and Felicia Houston hang out at Aviator Bar after work; the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church, where Dr. King preached. Credit Jada Yuan/The New York Times\n\nDriving by the Alabama State Capitol building in Montgomery, Michelle Browder, an African-American activist and founder of the I Am More Than... youth mentorship nonprofit, pointed out a looming bronze statue of Jefferson Davis, the first and only president of the Confederacy. It has a position of prominence right out front, as does a commemorative plaque on the marble steps marking the exact spot where he stood taking his oath of office in 1861. A state holiday recognizes his birthday. Farther down the Capitol lawn, Ms. Browder said, was a similar statue heralding Dr. J. Marion Sims, but I didn\u2019t recognize the name, and she wouldn\u2019t elaborate. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to do your homework on that one,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause my blood pressure goes up when I talk about him.\u201d\n\nMs. Browder wore red cat-eye glasses, an Army-green jacket, and a T-shirt bearing the words \u201cDream Destroyed\u201d and the face of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who began leading the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955 from the basement of a Baptist church just 440 feet from those Capitol steps. The vehicle she was careening through downtown, often parking akimbo on sidewalks or in the middle of the street, was a six-seat electric cart, from which she leads More Than Tours \u2014 explorations of a city that has been both the site of systemic oppression of her fellow African-Americans and the birthplace of the civil rights movement.\n\nWithin about 10 seconds, she\u2019d risked that blood pressure spike to tell me about Sims. \u201cHe\u2019s known as the father of modern gynecology,\u201d she said. \u201cHe enslaved black women and he used them as experiments.\u201d Specifically, he visited unimaginable tortures on 12 slave women, without anesthesia, under the belief that black people felt less than whites. \u201cWe are starting an initiative,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause we would like to see the mothers of gynecology erected beside him to give more to the story.\u201d The \u201cwe\u201d she refers to is a group she\u2019s organized called Friends of Anarcha, after a woman who endured 30 of Sims\u2019s vaginal surgeries before he declared her a success.\n\nMontgomery was my third stop on an insane yearlong mission I\u2019ve undertaken to visit every spot on The Times\u2019 52 Places to Go in 2018 list, and I was eager to find out why the city had snagged the No. 49 slot. By the end of four days, I\u2019d come to believe it should have ranked higher. As a tourist destination, Montgomery is \u2014 how shall I put this \u2014 heavy. In the same afternoon, visitors can see the Rosa Parks Museum, built at the site of her 1955 arrest for refusing to give up her seat to a white person, and the first White House of the Confederacy, a National Historic Landmark. (Ms. Browder is a descendant of Aurelia Browder, a woman who faced a similar arrest eight months before Parks, and who was the lead plaintiff in the 1956 lawsuit, Browder v. Gayle, that ended the bus boycott.)\n\nThe city is also undeniably relevant right now, with a deep commitment to confronting its past (and often present) of racism, at a time when white supremacism has re-entered the national conversation in a major way. Daily, I found myself moved to tears by any number of tales of brutality or hardship, and the strength it took to tell them. Even the trees that line the streets, dripping with Spanish moss like bearded old men, seem embedded with pain.\n\nI\u2019d arrived in MGM, as residents call it, less than two months after national news outlets had swarmed its streets to document the contentious Senate race in which Doug Jones, a Democrat, defeated Roy S. Moore, the Republican who had been accused of harassing and assaulting teenage girls. \u201cHis office is right there!\u201d Ms. Browder said, pointing to the windows of Mr. Moore\u2019s Foundation for Moral Law, in a building that once housed the bank that funded the Confederacy.\n\nImage A rendering of the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, scheduled to open on April 26. Credit Equal Justice Initiative\n\nWhat really ought to bump Montgomery up the 52 Places list is the National Memorial for Peace and Justice that the Equal Justice Initiative, a human rights legal nonprofit, is scheduled to open on April 26. Inspired by the memorials that Germany, Rwanda and South Africa have built to the atrocities of their own pasts, it pays tribute to the approximately 4,400 black victims of lynching by white mobs in the United States from 1877 to 1950, and is the country\u2019s first comprehensive memorial to racial terrorism.\n\nThe six-acre site and an accompanying museum that aims to link slavery to mass incarceration were under construction when I visited, but plans show it will consist of 800 rectangular, oxidized steel columns, each representing a particular county in the Deep South and Midwest, and bearing the names of the men, women and children killed there. While the columns will appear at first glance to touch the ground, the floor of the memorial will actually slope downward as visitors walk through it, allowing for the columns to hang over them, like bodies.\n\nThe Initiative\u2019s project is in many ways a companion piece to the work that the Southern Poverty Law Center, the nation\u2019s top legal advocate for victims of hate crimes, began in Montgomery with the Civil Rights Memorial in 1989. The memorial, designed by Maya Lin, consists of a stone table overflowing with water, bearing the names of 40 people who were murdered while doing things as simple as registering black people to vote. (A Civil Rights Memorial Center was added in 2005.)\n\nUpon first impression, even with a county population of 230,000, Montgomery seems far too quaint and conservative to be home to two of the country\u2019s most influential, progressive nonprofits fighting racial bias. Its airport has a single baggage claim and the rental car area is dotted with wooden rocking chairs, for an extra dose of Southern charm. I spent 20 minutes answering emails before walking outside and found myself the only person left on the premises, other than three bored-seeming policemen trading stories on the sidewalk.\n\n\u201cYou need a taxi, ma\u2019am?\u201d one of them asked. \u201cHe just left, so it\u2019s going to be 15 or 20 minutes.\u201d \u201cNow, where\u2019s my taxi driver?\u201d the officer mumbled to himself, then got on the radio: \u201cNick, there\u2019s a lady waiting for you.\u201d It took me a minute to absorb what I was hearing, but yes, apparently there was only one taxi driver working in Montgomery on Super Bowl Sunday.\n\nI\u2019d encountered a similar peculiarity earlier that morning, when I\u2019d made a last minute online reservation at a lovely bed-and-breakfast, Red Bluff Cottage, only to receive a distressed call from the owner, Bonnie Ponstein, wondering what time, exactly, I was planning to arrive. She, her husband and their usual housekeeper would all be at church.\n\nThat evening, I went to the city\u2019s historic downtown for an informal tour with an enterprising Lyft driver, Marcus McNeal. We stood talking in the middle of those cobblestone streets for what must have been 30 minutes before another car, or even another person, came by. \u201cYou could shoot a cannon down Dexter Avenue\u201d \u2014 downtown\u2019s main drag \u2014 \u201cand not hit a person on a Sunday,\u201d Barry Ponstein, Bonnie\u2019s husband told me later. \u201cEveryone\u2019s at church.\u201d\n\nThe one person we did meet out and about, actually, was Brother Ricky Segers, whom we found deep into a nightly ritual he\u2019s kept up for three years, of kneeling in front of a tiny souvenir American flag he\u2019s planted on the Capitol grounds to ask Jesus for more \u201cgodly\u201d leaders in this country. He feels as though Roy Moore was \u201cmistreated\u201d and Robert E. Lee was a hero. Still, he and Mr. McNeal, the Lyft driver, who is black and at least half his age, have known each other for a while now and seem to get along great.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to me, too,\u201d said Mr. McNeal of their friendliness. He\u2019s 24, hopes to open a chain of 24-hour coffee shops for workaholics, and comes from what he described as abject poverty. The car he drove me in belongs to his mother, who has been pulling double shifts as a nurse\u2019s assistant to pay for their heating bill that had gone from $80 to $480 during a cold spell that preceded my visit.\n\n\u201cMy mom is 62 years old and she makes $8 an hour, and that\u2019s the most she\u2019s ever made,\u201d he said. Their all-wood house has too much dry rot for them to install insulation, and they haven\u2019t been able to afford replacing the bathroom sink that fell out of their wall. \u201cIt\u2019s O.K.,\u201d he said. \u201cPoverty is a mind-set. If you change your mind-set, you\u2019re going to come out of it eventually.\u201d Later, he declared, \u201cCome back and see me when I have my Bentley.\u201d\n\nThe ad hoc tour Mr. McNeal took me on had been refreshingly frank. He drove straight to a historical placard describing the bustling slave markets that had been held at Court Square, the city\u2019s central roundabout. I asked Mr. McNeal why it didn\u2019t have more central placement in the square and he just laughed: \u201cWhat else are they going to do? It\u2019s not like they can build an auction platform here. That would really piss some people off!\u201d\n\nWhen I mentioned to him that multiple people had suggested I eat at Central, an upscale Southern food restaurant in downtown\u2019s tiny revitalized commercial district, he joked, \u201cCentral is so expensive, you\u2019d be better off buying a restaurant and opening and stocking the kitchen yourself.\u201d We went to Applebee\u2019s instead, and gorged on spinach and artichoke dip.\n\nI did end up at Central on another night, and it was indeed quite good \u2014 part of a growing culinary scene that will include gourmet offerings at the renovated Kress on Dexter building downtown, which opens in April. The former block-wide department store, built in 1929, will host rotating pop-up markets devoted to local artists \u2014 and has been engaged in incredibly responsible historical preservation, which has included donating bricks made by enslaved people to EJI \u2014 as well as keep its old \u201cWhites Only\u201d and \u201cColored Only\u201d signs on display for posterity. I\u2019m also a fan of the coffee shops Prevail Union and Cafe Louisa, as well as bar standouts like Leroy Lounge, a dive with a terrific selection of wines and craft beers, and Aviator Bar, covered in airplane-themed kitsch \u2014 inspired by the Wright Brothers, who started the country\u2019s first civilian flight school outside Montgomery.\n\nI met a group of black culinary students there one night who not only knew the city\u2019s history but said it fueled their ambitions. \u201cWe\u2019re in a bar on the road that was used to bring people to be auctioned off,\u201d said Steven McIntyre, who interns as a line cook at the highly regarded restaurant Vintage Year, \u201cand the fact that we are here today, just hanging out, enjoying life, it\u2019s incredible. Not super long ago, we would not be chilling here. This would not be chill.\u201d\n\nMy best culinary experiences, though, came by way of cabdrivers I\u2019d met. Nick Alloway, that lone Sunday driver, sent me to Mrs. B\u2019s Home Cooking, a yellow-painted soul food restaurant a few minutes west of downtown that serves up a different featured meat every day. Blocks north of the Capitol building is Davis Cafe, an even older family-run soul food joint that\u2019s the haunt of Hillard Wright, a King\u2019s Airport shuttle driver with a salt-and-pepper mustache, a gruff baritone voice and a leather rancher\u2019s hat that never left his head. He spent a whole afternoon showing me his version of the city he\u2019s lived in all of his 66 years. State senators were crowded into every vinyl booth. My plate overflowing with collard greens, creamed corn, peas and okra, turkey dressing, yams and cornbread cost around $6.\n\nFollowing the spirit of the locals I had met, I tried to absorb as much history as I could in four days: The Dexter Parsonage Museum, where Dr. King lived in the 1950s; the F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald Museum in the home where their marriage dissolved; Hank Williams\u2019s grave in the Oakwood Annex Cemetery. What stuck with me more than any of those, though, were the three hours I spent with Mr. Wright, engaging in his favorite pastime of driving around and looking at old houses. He\u2019d introduce each neighborhood with factoids about its legal, and later, de facto, segregation status. Entering the \u201cold money\u201d neighborhood of Old Cloverdale, for example, he pointed out, \u201cif you\u2019ll notice, you don\u2019t see any black folks living in there.\u201d I did notice.\n\nMr. Wright, though, is not bitter. He has built for himself a quiet life of hunting and fishing, driving around for money and minding his own business. \u201cEven through the segregation and hatred,\u201d he said, \u201cMontgomery, I wouldn\u2019t trade it. I\u2019ve been here my whole life and I\u2019ve enjoyed every day.\u201d\n\nThis year, the city will erect its first statue to Dr. King, in front of the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church where he used to preach near the Capitol. The statues of J. Marion Sims and Jefferson Davis, erected in 1939 and 1940, will be in view, too. Alabama will remain one of two states that celebrate the King and Lee birthdays in a combined holiday. This is how change seems to come in Montgomery: messy and long overdue. Still, how wonderful to see progress in action.\n\nJada Yuan will be traveling to every place on this year\u2019s 52 Places to Go list. Her next dispatch will be from Disney Springs, Fla.

The result, beyond the humanitarian catastrophe, has been a reputational catastrophe, as the U.S. demonstrated that it would not back its local allies, or seriously enforce norms against the use of chemical weapons, or devise and implement a strategy compatible with our stated policy.\n\nWhatever else one might say about American regional interests or moral obligations when it comes to Syria, we have a vital national interest in foiling Dictatorship Inc.\u2019s ambitions for the country.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe could do something to reverse our reputation for unreliability by doing more to protect our Kurdish allies against their enemies \u2014 including the Turks \u2014 much as we did after the 1991 Persian Gulf war.

We could find covert ways to dramatically increase the military price Russia is paying for its intervention.\n\nAnd we could do all this, without burdening ourselves as we did in Iraq, with the task of sorting out Syria\u2019s future.\n\nThat requires an administration capable of devising, coordinating and executing a consistent military and diplomatic strategy.

We don\u2019t have one.\n\nAbove all, it requires a belief in what used to be called the free world: of its shared moral principles, broad interests, and long-term aspirations.

I can relate to self-loathing. The reason a person lashes out the way Dixon does is because he hates himself, so anybody can relate to that. I\u2019m drawn to complex characters; they\u2019re all filled with so many different feelings, and that\u2019s what makes them interesting. The first \u201cIron Man,\u201d Tony Stark, was an interesting character. He drinks too much, he\u2019s a womanizer, and then he has this epiphany. That\u2019s what\u2019s interesting.\n\nWhat do you think it was about this role, and this film, that led to so many awards?\n\nIt\u2019s the transformational aspect of it, the fact that he was really many different roles wrapped up in one role. He\u2019s a doofus, he\u2019s a racist, he\u2019s violent, he\u2019s a mama\u2019s boy. There\u2019s a few heroic things at certain points. But he\u2019s very flawed, and it\u2019s a boy-to-man journey.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere\u2019s been criticism that your character got away scot-free for his racist behavior and for throwing a guy out the window, and never being brought to justice.\n\nIt\u2019s a small town and, who knows, in real life maybe he would have gotten thrown in prison. It\u2019s a sort of dark fairy tale in certain ways \u2014 it\u2019s not necessarily meant to be completely realistic. And if it is meant to be realistic, in real life, things aren\u2019t tied up in a bow. People who deserve to get punished don\u2019t necessarily get punished.\n\nDid it surprise you that there was criticism of the movie along these lines?\n\nNo, whenever a movie is popular and it is a complex dramatic story, I think it\u2019s going to stir up a lot of feelings. A lot of good stuff come out of it \u2014 the billboards that have been popping up [activists recreated versions of the billboards in Miami and London]. That\u2019s kind of incredible, when a movie can effect social change, that\u2019s kind of astounding. I think Mildred [the film\u2019s mother, played by Frances McDormand, who is seeking justice in the murder of her daughter] is a really beautiful working-class wonder woman in some ways. It\u2019s a kind of antihero slash protagonist thing that I think women really need right now. Mildred and [the directors] Greta Gerwig and Patty Jenkins.

Is it self-taught?\n\nIt\u2019s a long story, but I hung out with a certain crowd, and it was a way to meet girls.\n\nWhat kind of certain crowd?\n\nSan Francisco is not all cable cars and Rice-A-Roni. There were some tough kids there. When I was in middle school, there was a more white supremacist kind of group I didn\u2019t get along with. I got in a lot of fights with them and didn\u2019t win a lot of those fights. I didn\u2019t get along with the rich kids, people we called WPODs: white punks on dope. My school was interracial, and I met a cool group of friends who introduced me to some other friends. I used to do really bad break dancing, when \u201cThriller\u201d and \u201cPurple Rain\u201d came out. I was into Run-DMC, Grandmaster Flash, Doug E. Fresh, Eric B. & Rakim. Probably my biggest inspiration was James Brown, and watching Tom Cruise in \u201cRisky Business.\u201d I remember practicing that, and watching James Brown do the splits. I [recently] did SoulCycle, I\u2019m not proud to say, and Usher was next to me. I thought I had rhythm until I was on a bicycle next to Usher. This is what happens when you go to spinning class in Hollywood.\n\nWere you intimidated working with Frances McDormand?\n\nI think it\u2019s the biggest compliment to Frances that people are asking, \u201cWere you intimidated by her?\u201d Not really, but I was nervous to get in the ring with a great actor. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of great actors. She\u2019s really a force. I think what\u2019s great about her is her integrity. Her sense of truth is like an iron bar. All these people \u2014 Woody [Harrelson, a co-star], Martin [McDonagh, the film\u2019s writer-director], Frances \u2014 are true anarchists, they really are. I think it comes through in their work.

This week, he was outraged when Sessions didn\u2019t personally investigate the Russia probe\u2019s relation to a Clinton campaign-financed dossier of potential Trump scandals. It was certainly what Roy Cohn would have done. But Sessions gave the job of inspecting the situation to the inspector general.\n\n\u201cDISGRACEFUL!\u201d tweeted the president. In another angry posting the president referred to the A.G. as \u201cSession,\u201d which suggested a certain emotional distance.\n\nThen the spelling was revised.

On Friday morning Trump was ranting about Alec Baldwin, who he called \u201cAlex Baldwin, whose dieing mediocre career was saved by his impersonation of me on SNL.\u201d\n\nThat predawn message, too, got quickly erased and reposted, with Baldwin\u2019s name and \u201cdying\u201d fixed. I used to think Trump was using voice dictation, but Siri knows how to spell.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSessions responded that \u201cas long as I am the attorney general, I will continue to discharge my duties with integrity and honor.\u201d Since he communicated via a traditional press release rather than a Fox interview or social media rant, we may never know if the president saw it.\n\nBut Trump certainly noticed with displeasure that Sessions had failed to go away. Last week, at a meeting on school safety, the president carefully placed Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi between himself and his own A.G. Bondi has been a presidential favorite for a long time. Perhaps you remember that she refused to join in a multistate suit against Trump University, a decision which had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that Donald had donated money to support her campaign.\n\nAlthough Sessions was obviously the highest-ranking person in the room besides the president, it was Bondi Trump called upon to speak first, praising her as \u201ca really tremendous attorney general.\u201d Sessions may have been a little hurt by having to wait his turn, but he nevertheless went on to burble some praise for the president\u2019s meeting with members of Congress on guns.\n\nTrump doled out one mini-compliment about Sessions\u2019s work fighting immigrant gangs, then quickly changed the subject to a rant about the state of California. (\u201cThey have the highest taxes in the nation and they don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening out there. Frankly it\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d) Sessions, probably delighted to have somebody else called a disgrace, nodded supportively.\n\nHow long do you think he\u2019ll last? Well, he\u2019s made it clear he doesn\u2019t intend to go on his own volition, and despite the massive churn in the administration, most of the departed have resigned under their own power.

While it may not be a common vantage point, the narrative is a natural one for Marilyn Stern, a photographer and graphic artist who is a member of the Metropolitan Postcard Club of New York City.\n\nNot surprisingly, the vast majority of postcards that feature black people in the United States from the 19th and 20th centuries were very racist, she said.\n\n\u201cI was so sick of seeing these horrible racist stereotypes,\u201d said Ms. Stern, a collector since the mid-1970s. \u201cWhenever I came across something that was not racist or not stereotypical, or even went so far as showing romance between the races, I wanted to save it and collect it.\u201d\n\nHer collection, which numbers about 3,000, has about 300 postcards that depict African-American life in all lights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for us to fathom how isolated people were, especially in rural areas and isolated small towns before there were telephones and radios,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were postal deliveries three times a day, so it was the internet of the early 1900s.\u201d\n\nPostcards had better printing technology than magazines and newspapers did at the time, as the burst of color in the selection below shows. They could show racism with clarity. \u201cThe idea that you could see images so realistic blew people away,\u201d she said.\n\nMany of the racist postcards were a form of propaganda, she said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to see how racism was manifested in the past,\u201d she said, \u201cperhaps to better fight it in the present. You can recognize something if you\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d\n\nBelow is a selection from Ms. Stern\u2019s collection with descriptions based on her research.\n\nTrade Cards\n\nImage\n\nAfrican-Americans were often subjects \u2014 and targets \u2014 of advertising cards that were issued before 1900. These cards were frequently given away in products, or with the purchase of a product.\n\nAbove, an advertisement for J & P Coats thread. Below, a country doctor dispensing Ayer\u2019s Cathartic Pills.\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk, a dance created by plantation slaves as a satire of Southern white society, was the focus of these cards, which featured two black children and an African-American troupe that toured Europe in the late 1800s and early 1900s.\n\nRacist Cards\n\nImage\n\nThe card on the left was shot in a professional studio, but it was labeled \u201cHer Country Cousins.\u201d The implication was that no matter how refined, educated or successful black Americans became, they were still basically savages, Ms. Stern said.\n\nThe two cards on the right were produced in 1905 in New York on the common theme of the delivery stork. The first one, with the caption \u201cComparing Notes,\u201d shows both a black baby and a white baby, with no apparent bias. The second one shows two black babies with the slogan \u201cNo Race Suicide,\u201d implying that a high black birthrate threatened white supremacy, she said.\n\n\u201cLovers of All Nations\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThis postcard was from a series mailed in 1908 that was called \u201cLovers of All Nations.\u201d The banjo was a racial stereotype, but the card is in the non-discriminating \u201cFamily of Man\u201d tradition.\n\nMemories of Slavery\n\nImage\n\nPostcards once served as documentary photography. Some cards honored older African-Americans of the South, who were living memories of slavery. This was part of a series, and it was mailed in 1906.\n\nLife in the Jim Crow South\n\nImage\n\nA fortuneteller with white clients, mailed in 1908.\n\nHoliday Greetings\n\nImage\n\nIdealized country life, in a card mailed in 1907, as Americans flocked to cities.\n\nReligion\n\nImage\n\nA card, likely from the early 1950s, urging parishioners to come to church.\n\nReal Photos\n\nImage\n\nAn unidentified young woman in her graduation cap and gown, in a studio portrait taken between the 1920s and \u201940s. Cards labeled \u201cReal Photo Postcards\u201d are set apart from commercially printed postcards and are actual photographs printed on photographic paper with a preprinted postcard back.\n\nAchievement\n\nImage\n\nThe many important contributions that African-Americans made to society were rarely acknowledged in older postcards, but an exception was made for the scientist and educator George Washington Carver.\n\nHis experiments with peanuts, sweet potatoes and other crops contributed greatly to the economy of the South. This card \u2014 from a photo shot on Kodachrome or Ektachrome film \u2014 is from the late 1950s to mid-60s.\n\nFor more, see Ms. Stern\u2019s postcard blog, and a review of the film Through a Lens Darkly that deals with African-American representation in postcards and photography.

Even in rare cases when pragmatic business leaders helped to broker agreements, which was reportedly the case in North Carolina with the repeal of the so-called bathroom bill, a culture war still festers.\n\nC.E.O. activism has typically not brought people together, working from the middle out. Instead, this type of activism, largely from the progressive side, has begun to galvanize conservatives. For example, in Georgia, lawmakers stripped tax breaks for Delta over its decision to cut ties with the N.R.A.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the short term, Dick\u2019s will become another corporate poster child for how political polarization and so-called negative partisanship \u2014 an automatic rejection of members of the opposing party \u2014 are infecting our society. There will be a rash of news stories about increased sales from liberal consumers rushing into Dick\u2019s stores to vote with their wallets. Conservative media will point to boycotts and highlight other retailers that are stepping in to serve disaffected consumers.\n\nBut the real story will be the long game. C.E.O. activism represents a historic shift in the way corporations intersect with national politics. Rather than chief executives shaping political discourse, however, our toxic political environment is dictating corporate strategy. Instead of being cast as practical technocrats who could unite us, chief executives will be swept up in our cultural war, just like university presidents, celebrities, professional athletes and religious leaders before them.\n\nBrands are likely to become even more segmented into red and blue, strengthening the association between liberals and Priuses and conservatives and Cracker Barrel. Corporate brand campaigns could soon resemble political campaigns, with efforts to identify the most intensely loyal consumers for repeat purchases as opposed to attracting new ones.\n\nMainstream brands may become as common as moderate politicians \u2014 that is, a rare, perhaps extinct, species in today\u2019s political environment. Twitter and PayPal serve diverse customers today, but their recent efforts to regulate their own platforms have led to allegations of political bias and incited competitors.\n\nMost companies are not prepared for this new world of politics. Pepsi and Starbucks have already been victims of orchestrated fake news campaigns; there will be many more. As more companies take stands, those remaining will be named and shamed on social media, creating impossible choices in an environment where neutrality is not an option.\n\nLike our politicians, corporate chiefs will have to quickly figure out what stand they should take on the issue of the day by reflecting on their core convictions and estimating how their (customer) base will react. Like pollsters, they will have to assess which kind of consumers they can write off and which ones to curry favor with. The right answer will vary by a company\u2019s geographic location, who their employees are and how much they depend on favorable government regulation.\n\nThere is no going back. Lists are being kept and wins are being tallied by pressure groups aiming to get companies on their side. The issues that divide us will keep being served up in relentless succession, forcing companies to take stands on just about everything.\n\nMuch of this is a reflection of who we have become. Corporate America thrives by selling us what we want, and they do that by appealing to our identities. In 2018, for many Americans, our political identity seems to define us more than ever. It already influences whom we socialize with on Facebook, whom we marry, what news we read and where we live.

If you are making a decision when angry or exhausted, the most critical skill is self-regulation, which enables you to control your emotions, withstand pressure from others, resist temptation and check your impulses. Unlike cold cognitive abilities, self-regulation does not mature until about age 22, research has shown. (This is a good reason to raise the minimum age for purchasing firearms from 18 to 21 or older, as some have proposed.)\n\nThis psychological evidence is backed up by neuroscientific findings. Neuroimaging studies show that brain systems necessary for cold cognition are mature by mid-adolescence, whereas those that govern self-regulation are not fully developed until a person\u2019s early 20s.\n\nIf the voting age were lowered, would that necessitate changing other laws to bring them into alignment? Of course not. We use a wide variety of chronological ages to draw lines between minors and adults when it comes to smoking, driving, viewing violent or sexually explicit movies, being eligible for the death penalty and drinking alcohol. Although the specific ages used for these purposes often lack a good rationale, there is no reason lowering the voting age would require lowering, say, the drinking age, any more than allowing people to drive at 16 should permit them to drink or smoke at that age as well.\n\nIn addition to the scientific case for lowering the voting age, there is also a civic argument. Consider the dozen or so countries like Argentina, Austria, Brazil and Nicaragua that allow people to vote at 16 in national, state or local elections. In such countries, voter turnout among 16- and 17-year-olds is significantly higher than it is among older young adults.\n\nThis is true in parts of the United States as well. In Takoma Park, Md., a city that permits 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in local elections, that age group is twice as likely to vote than are 18-year-olds.\n\nWhy is higher turnout among 16- and 17-year-olds so important? Because there is evidence that people who don\u2019t vote the first time they are eligible are less likely to vote regularly in the future. Considering that people between 18 and 24 have the lowest voter turnout of any age group in the United States (a country that has one of the lowest rates of voter turnout in the developed world), allowing people to begin voting at an age at which they are more likely to vote might increase future turnout at all ages.\n\nThe last time the United States lowered the federal voting age was in 1971, when it went from 21 to 18. In that instance, the main motivating force was outrage over the fact that 18-year-olds could be sent to fight in Vietnam but could not vote.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe proposal to lower the voting age to 16 is motivated by today\u2019s outrage that those most vulnerable to school shootings have no say in how such atrocities are best prevented.

This week, several national chains, including Walmart, have responded to pressure and announced new restrictions on gun sales.\n\nBut there is another important step that private companies should take. They should promise not to sell a gun to anyone who doesn\u2019t pass a criminal background check. And, yes, the law currently allows sales to some people who do not.\n\nHere\u2019s how: In 1994, the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act began requiring criminal background checks for all guns sold by licensed sellers. (This is different from the broader background checks, which would also cover gun shows and private sales \u2014 and which public-health experts strongly favor.)\n\nThe Brady law gave law enforcement five days to conduct the background check. The National Rifle Association \u2014 showing it wasn\u2019t so concerned about criminals getting guns \u2014 lobbied to reduce the window to one day. Ultimately, Congress settled on three days.\n\nIt turns out that three days aren\u2019t enough time to conduct every background check. Millions of guns are sold every year, and background checks can be complex, spanning federal, state and local data. Last year, about 310,000 federal background checks \u2014 or 3.6 percent \u2014 were not completed in three days, according to ThinkProgress.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen that happens, the gun seller can decide whether to go through with the sale or not. The 2015 mass murder in a Charleston, S.C., church, for example, was committed with a gun bought after an incomplete background check. \u201cCurrent public policy,\u201d as Kristen Rand of the Violence Policy Center says, \u201cprioritizes transferring guns into buyers\u2019 hands above public safety.\u201d\n\nSome gun sellers do the right thing. A Walmart spokesman told my colleague Ian Prasad Philbrick that the company had not allowed a sale after an incomplete check for years. But it\u2019s unclear how many companies follow the same policy.\n\nThe best case is that Congress closes this loophole and requires a gun buyer to pass a background check, even if it takes more than three days. But I hope the new generation of activists don\u2019t wait for Congress. All gun sellers should be pressured to declare their policy publicly \u2014 and change that policy if they\u2019re selling guns to potential criminals.", "keywords": ["policy", "sign", "gun", "background", "times", "sellers", "days", "guns", "trump", "chaos", "checks", "check"], "polarity": 0.05244982290436836, "subjectivity": 0.4054521236339418},

The scene never made it into the movie. So, what happened? In a conversation with ScreenCrush\u2019s E. Oliver Whitney, the screenwriter Joe Robert Cole, one of the writers for \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d says he vaguely recalls some discussion of whether to include the lesbian love story. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t some major theme through that we were looking to explore with [those characters] in terms of the story,\u201d Cole clarifies. \u201cWe didn\u2019t like, pull out a full thread of some theme.\u201d\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t Play With Our Emotions: \u201cBlack Panther\u201d and Queer Representation\u2019 [The Root]\n\nBriana Lawrence, who identifies as a queer black woman, was surprised that the scene\u2019s exclusion didn\u2019t bother her. \u201cI should\u2019ve been cursing Ryan Coogler out, swift and fast like my mama taught me when someone pisses me off,\u201d she writes. \u201cBut after thinking it over, I\u2019m happy the scene didn\u2019t make it into the movie, and that feels blasphemous to admit as someone who is always championing representation \u2014 especially for queer folks of color like me.\u201d\n\nHeartwarming Bonus Read: \u2018I Took 7th Graders to See \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d Here\u2019s What They Said.\u2019 [The New York Times]\n\nProf. Kevin Noble Maillard watched the film with a handful of tweens from a Brooklyn public school.

None has so blithely ignored this conflict as Mr. Trump.\n\nPublic service can certainly be a family legacy in the United States, and name recognition is crucial to successful campaigns. So voters have proved willing to accept, or to be enticed by, a candidate\u2019s family connections, from the Adamses, to the Roosevelts, to the Kennedys, to the Bushes, to the 2016 presidential primary featuring the brother and son of two former presidents and the wife of yet another. But Americans\u2019 aversion to presidential nepotism has also been deep and lasting, even as presidents have tested it.\n\nJefferson was furious when John Adams appointed his son John Quincy Adams, already an accomplished diplomat, as the nation\u2019s first minister to Prussia. While even the younger Adams objected, his father retorted, \u201cThe sons of Presidents have the Same Claim to Liberty, Equality and the benefit of the Laws with all other Citizens.\u201d\n\nUntil 1857, presidents paid for their own White House staffs, and many named relatives to these jobs. But after the assassination of James Garfield by a thwarted patronage seeker led to the creation of the Civil Service system in 1883, presidential relatives served chiefly as informal advisers and envoys because of popular revulsion with the spoils system.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

Kennedy\u2019s appointment of his brother Robert as attorney general that led to the first antinepotism law, in 1967. It prohibited presidents and members of Congress from appointing or promoting relatives and spouses \u201cin or to a civilian position in the agency in which he is serving or over which he exercises jurisdiction or control.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department has cited that law in a half-dozen legal opinions that prevented Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama from appointing relatives to roles as minor as unpaid clerical assistant.\n\nIn 1972, the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel opined that the law \u201cextends to any appointment to a \u2018civilian position\u2019 over which the president exercises jurisdiction or control\u201d and that \u201cit seems clearly applicable to subordinate positions on the White House staff.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department again cited the 1967 law in blocking Mr. Carter\u2019s plan to name his wife, Rosalynn, to lead a commission on mental health, even though first ladies have often been powerful informal advisers to their husbands.\n\nThen Bill Clinton pushed the boundaries between informal adviser and government employee by naming his wife, Hillary Clinton, to lead a White House task force on health care. There is no public evidence he sought the Justice Department\u2019s opinion on the legality of the appointment. But when a lawsuit accused the administration of violating a federal law that requires presidential advisory committees with any nongovernmental members to make their records public, the court maintained that Mrs. Clinton was in essence a federal employee, preventing the task force from being fully subject to the disclosure law.\n\nIn a twist of history, the acceptance of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s role handed her nemesis Donald Trump justification for putting his own relatives in power and running the White House like his private real estate business. In a January 2017 ruling, Daniel Koffsky, a career lawyer in the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, noted that the court said that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s appointment to a White House position did not violate the antinepotism law. He also said that a 1978 statute governing White House appointments granted the president \u201cspecial hiring authority,\u201d a position many ethics experts criticized.\n\nThe ruling allowed Mr. Trump to give his daughter Ivanka Trump and Mr. Kushner, her husband, White House offices and virtually unfettered access to the cabinet and world leaders.\n\nThe couple\u2019s many businesses offer foreign allies and adversaries a channel for seeking to influence American policy, fueling suspicion that the Trumps and Mr. Kushner are leveraging public office for private gain. The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that officials of at least four countries have discussed ways to manipulate the inexperienced Mr. Kushner by taking advantage of his family\u2019s financial difficulties and business entanglements.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Kushner\u2019s family has tried to leverage his position, too. They broadcast his role in the administration as part of a real estate sales pitch in Beijing, touting a controversial program that grants foreigners American visas in exchange for investments in development projects. On the same day as Mr. Trump\u2019s first meeting with President Xi Jinping of China \u2014 who was serenaded by the president\u2019s grandchildren \u2014 Ms. Trump\u2019s company was awarded three trademarks in the Chinese market.\n\nAfter the meeting, the Pangoal Institution, a Beijing think tank, described the Trump White House as a tribal battleground dominated by the \u201cTrump family clan.\u201d The New Yorker quoted the think tank\u2019s assessment that the Trump family seems to \u201cdirectly influence final decisions\u201d on business and international relations in a way that \u201chas rarely been seen in the political history of the United States.\u201d The analysis used an ancient Chinese expression meaning \u201cto treat the state as your possession,\u201d a feudal concept of governance that conflicts with basic American principles.\n\nAppalling as it is, White House nepotism is only one element of Mr. Trump\u2019s broader determination to install unqualified friends, patrons and political lackeys across the government.\n\nThe founders would have dreaded a president like Mr. Trump. His behavior is a warning that ethical traditions and culture are not enough. Lawmakers need to harden some of these norms into law, to safeguard the executive branch and the public trust from future presidents eager to use America\u2019s highest office to benefit their families.", "keywords": ["mr", "white", "intrigue", "presidents", "law", "public", "relatives", "family", "appointment", "trump", "house"], "polarity": 0.10907287157287159, "subjectivity": 0.3383984938672438},

Ms. Hicks surely saw this narrow path to success under Mr. Trump and decided to walk it. The dutiful daughter strategy is one a man in her position could never have used.

Playing nice for such a president is a different calculation than, say, a dental hygienist, lawyer or Walmart cashier might make under a similarly sexist supervisor.\n\nBeing new to working in the political world, Ms. Hicks may not have made that decision at all. If you don\u2019t see politics as a vehicle for positive change but rather as an abstraction shape-shifted into a job, and if you view the presidency as about power rather than public service, of course working to get your boss elected and then working closely with him in the White House would feel like nothing more than an exciting career opportunity. Why wouldn\u2019t Ms. Hicks use every tool in her arsenal to remain in the good graces of her volatile boss, and climb up the ladder accordingly?\n\nAnd yet, suddenly, she climbed off. It seems unlikely Ms. Hicks had a crisis of conscience; nor is she, an adult woman with agency and considerable privilege, a victim of her circumstances. More likely, she\u2019s motivated by the same thing as her boss: unadulterated self-interest. Perhaps, finally, she realized the good-girl game is rigged to let the boys win.\n\nThe problem with being the mostly silent hardworking nice girl is that you also might end up the fall guy \u2014 the one who stays up all night finishing the project while your less-diligent peers knock off, the one who simply smiles tightly as a male colleague takes credit for your work. Or the one who, having long been a sympathetic filial ear for your very undisciplined boss, is finally being forced to talk \u2014 and realizing that your story does not sound good.\n\nMs. Hicks has already admitted to telling \u201cwhite lies\u201d for the president, a thoroughly banal disclosure from a member of an administration that hemorrhages blatant falsities as a matter of course, but that may prove problematic depending on who she lied to and what about.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe dutiful daughter gig always has a shelf life \u2014 maybe you get too old for it to be convincing; maybe your work environment changes and success hinges less on pleasing one prone-to-flattery man; maybe you learn the hard way that women who seek to ascend to the top eventually have to choose between being liked or respected (in a far more atypical scenario, maybe you find yourself embroiled in a federal investigation and investigators just aren\u2019t going for the good-girl routine). At some point, most of us either choose or are forced to be adult women who own our ambition and take responsibility for our decisions.\n\nThe unfortunate truth is that Ms. Hicks probably isn\u2019t there yet. Her departure is more likely a ticket to a lucrative PR or consulting gig than evidence of any quasi-feminist awakening or rejection of Trump-wrought devastation \u2014 there are a lot of companies no doubt eager to hire a compliant, inoffensive woman with access to the president, and offer her substantial sums in exchange.\n\nBut one can hope there\u2019s something more interesting brewing beneath that placid surface.

Credit Joe Cavaretta/South Florida Sun-Sentinel, via Associated Press\n\nI wonder if I\u2019m wrong on the subject of guns. I started this latest round of the debate with the presumption that supporters of moderate gun restrictions are popularly strong but legislatively weak. Since Sandy Hook in 2012, more than two dozen states have passed gun laws and almost all of those laws have LOOSENED gun restrictions. Roughly 360 gun bills have been introduced in Congress, and they have all failed but one, which also loosened gun use.\n\nThe blunt fact is that Republicans control most legislatures. To get anything passed, I thought, it would be necessary to separate some Republicans from the absolutist N.R.A. position. To do that you have to depolarize the issue: show gun owners some respect, put red state figures at the head and make the gun discussion look more like the opioid discussion. The tribalists in this country have little interest in the opioid issue. As a result, a lot of pragmatic things are being done across partisan lines.\n\nThe people pushing for gun restrictions have basically done the exact opposite of what I thought was wise. Instead of depolarizing the issue they have massively polarized it. The students from Parkland are being assisted by all the usual hyper-polarizing left-wing groups: Planned Parenthood, Move On and the Women\u2019s March. The rhetoric has been extreme. Marco Rubio has been likened to a mass murderer while the N.R.A. has been called a terrorist organization.\n\nThe early results would seem to completely vindicate my position. The Florida Legislature turned aside gun restrictions. New gun measures in Congress have been quickly shelved. Democrats are more likely to lose House and Senate seats in the key 2018 pro-gun states. The losing streak continues.\n\nYet I have to admit that something bigger is going on. It could be that progressives understood something I didn\u2019t. It could be that you can win more important victories through an aggressive cultural crusade than you can through legislation. Progressives could be on the verge of delegitimizing their foes, on guns but also much else, rendering them untouchable for anybody who wants to stay in polite society. That would produce social changes far vaster than limiting assault rifles.\n\nTwo things have fundamentally changed the landscape. First, over the past two years conservatives have self-marginalized. In supporting Donald Trump they have tied themselves to a man whose racial prejudices, sexual behavior and personal morality put him beyond the pale of decent society.\n\nWhile becoming the movement of Dinesh D\u2019Souza, Sean Hannity and Franklin Graham, they have essentially expelled the leaders and thinkers who have purchase in mainstream culture. Conservatism is now less a political or philosophic movement and more a separatist subculture that participates in its own ostracism.\n\nSecond, progressives are getting better and more aggressive at silencing dissenting behavior. All sorts of formerly legitimate opinions have now been deemed beyond the pale on elite campuses. Speakers have been disinvited and careers destroyed. The boundaries are being redrawn across society.\n\nAs Andrew Sullivan noted recently, \u201cworkplace codes today read like campus speech codes of a few years ago.\u201d There are a number of formerly popular ideas that can now end your career: the belief that men and women have inherent psychological differences, the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman, opposition to affirmative action.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening today is that certain ideas about gun rights, and maybe gun ownership itself, are being cast in the realm of the morally illegitimate and socially unacceptable.\n\nThat\u2019s the importance of the corporate efforts to end N.R.A. affiliations. It\u2019s not about N.R.A. members saving some money when they fly. It\u2019s that they are not morally worthy of being among the affiliated groups. The idea is to stigmatize.\n\nIf progressives can cut what\u2019s left of the conservative movement off from mainstream society, they will fundamentally alter the culture war. We think of the culture war as this stagnant thing in which both sides scream at each other. But eventually there could be a winner. Progressives have won on most social issues. They could win on nearly everything else.\n\nContinued school shootings could be just the thing that persuades the mainstream that conservatism is vulgar and socially illegitimate, somewhere between smoking and segregationism. If that kind of total victory is on offer for progressives, why should they take my advice and tone things down for the sake of a few small gun laws? The big prize here is not gun laws. It\u2019s winning the culture war, with the gunfight as the final battle.\n\nThe only thing I\u2019d say to my progressive friends is, be careful how you win your victories. It is one thing to win by persuasion and another thing to win by elite cultural intimidation. Illiberalism breeds illiberalism. Using elite power, whether economic or cultural, to silence less educated foes usually produces a backlash.\n\nConservatives have zero cultural power, but they have immense political power. Even today, voters trust Republicans on the gun issue more than Democrats. If you exile 40 percent of the country from respectable society they will mount a political backlash that will make Donald Trump look like Adlai Stevenson.", "keywords": ["war", "culture", "win", "gun", "nra", "opinion", "laws", "issue", "restrictions", "progressives", "thing"], "polarity": 0.14585042519508543, "subjectivity": 0.4467462418918732},

Elliott and Blaney will be in the second row after winning the qualifying duels Thursday.\n\nOne driver in particular has the potential to do more than anyone to shake up the sport. A graduate of Nascar\u2019s Drive for Diversity program, Darrell Wallace Jr., 24, could give stock car racing something it has never had before: an African-American star.\n\nBut that is not why Richard Petty brought Wallace onto his team. Late last season, Wallace, who goes by the nickname Bubba, got four rides with Richard Petty Motorsports. It was enough for Petty, one of Nascar\u2019s most iconic names, to not only give Wallace a full-time ride, but also to give him his famed No. 43 racecar to drive. Wallace is the first African-American to drive full-time in the top Nascar series since Wendell Scott in 1971.\n\nPetty insisted, though, that he is colorblind when it comes to evaluating talent. Sure, it would be great if Wallace brings the sport into the African-American community, but as far as Petty is concerned, that\u2019s secondary.\n\n\u201cI hope he advances us as a race team,\u201d Petty said in an email. \u201cI care about what Bubba can do behind the wheel for us. The rest, there are a lot of eyes on Bubba, but he\u2019s handling it well. I know come Sunday he\u2019ll be ready to get into a racecar and just show his talent. If he does well, the rest will come and he\u2019ll grow our fan base.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThose eyes on Wallace, much as they were on Tiger Woods a generation ago, prompted Earnhardt to call him last week. The son of racing legend, Earnhardt knows all about the pressure of expectations.\n\n\u201cHe told me that the next few weeks will basically be hell with all the off-the-track stuff,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cBut he said it\u2019ll all be worth it because I have an opportunity to do things outside the sport that not many other drivers will ever say they\u2019ve had that kind of opportunity to do. So embrace it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe child of a white father and a black mother, Wallace said that he does not quite understand why his skin color makes him newsworthy in 2018. But he knows that stock car racing, with its Southern roots and the Confederate flags that still wave from some fans\u2019 campers and cars, has not attracted an African-American audience.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But there\u2019s also venturing out into a different market, into different avenues where the African-American culture lives. We all have to do better at that.\u201d\n\nThere are challenges, of course. On social media, where vulgar epithets can be spewed from faceless and fictitious monikers, Wallace has, at times, had to think twice before responding. He admits he has not always been successful.\n\n\u201cThere is always going to be haters out there, people who don\u2019t want to see you succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that since Day 1 from my parents. Just keep your head down and keep moving, that\u2019s the best you can do.\u201d\n\nBlaney, his closest friend on the circuit, has been around Wallace when offensive remarks have been made.\n\n\u201cThankfully, it\u2019s very, very rare, but it upsets me,\u201d Blaney said. \u201cBubba\u2019s great at handling it. He\u2019s an amazing ambassador for the sport. And he\u2019s really talented and a heck of a competitor. All of us are competitive, but his competitiveness is unlike anyone I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nNascar\u2019s diversity has become an issue again after its only female racer, Danica Patrick, announced she will retire from the circuit after the Daytona 500. But Wallace is not the only driver who can energize an overlooked community. What he can do for an African-American audience, Su\u00e1rez can do for the Latino market. A native of Monterrey, Mexico, Su\u00e1rez said he had noticed an uptick in social media messages from a variety of Latino countries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually either people who tell me they\u2019re now following the sport because of me, or they\u2019ve been fans and now they have a driver to root for,\u201d said Su\u00e1rez, who is also a graduate of the Drive for Diversity program. \u201cThe potential is huge. This is the most diverse country in the world, but we have to improve diversity in Nascar. If we can make the sport more diverse, we\u2019ll see the same thing with fans. More diversity on the racetrack will mean more diversity in the stands.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Nascar waits, wondering who will emerge as its next star.", "keywords": ["emerge", "waits", "sport", "racing", "generation", "nascar", "wallace", "drive", "hes", "africanamerican", "petty", "leader", "su\u00e1rez", "diversity"], "polarity": 0.13599389129389128, "subjectivity": 0.4590651755651755},

And while many Americans own a bit of stock via their retirement accounts, even if you include these indirect holdings, more than 80 percent of stocks are owned by the wealthiest 10 percent of the population. So on the face of it, the wealthy are giving themselves a big gift, and sending the bill to the middle class.\n\nNow, the tax cut\u2019s defenders insist that it won\u2019t really work that way, that the benefits of lower corporate taxes will trickle down to workers instead. How\u2019s that supposed to happen?\n\nWell, the theory is that lower corporate taxes will draw in lots of money from overseas, which corporations will invest in new plants and equipment, which will drive up the demand for labor, which will raise wages. And to be fair, there\u2019s probably something to this theory \u2014 something, but not very much.\n\nFirst of all, even if the process were to work as advertised, it would take a long time \u2014 probably decades. Even the most optimistic analyses suggest that there would be little effect on wages for the first few years, which means that for now what looks like a tax break for the wealthy is, in fact, a tax break for the wealthy.\n\nSecond, the story relies on a long chain of events with multiple weak links. For example, corporations with monopoly power won\u2019t see lower taxes as a reason to invest more; they\u2019ll just take the money. Meanwhile, there\u2019s growing evidence that big employers are using their power to suppress wages; cutting their taxes won\u2019t change that fact. So even in the long run we shouldn\u2019t expect a lot of trickle-down.\n\nBut wait \u2014 weren\u2019t there a lot of stories about companies using the tax cut to give their workers bonuses? Yes, there were \u2014 but only because the news media let themselves get played. Most of those bonuses would have happened anyway: In an economy with low unemployment, there are always some companies deciding to pay a bit more to attract workers. But companies had every incentive to pretend that the tax cut was responsible, if only to curry favor with the Trump administration.\n\nAnd in any case the bonus hype was out of all proportion to the reality. So far, we\u2019ve seen about $6 billion in bonuses versus more than $170 billion in stock buybacks, that is, handing money to wealthy stockholders. And money spent on buybacks is money that isn\u2019t being invested in plants and equipment, the supposed point of the tax cut.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo the message to middle-class taxpayers is, if you think you were helped by the tax cut, think again. Donald Trump and his allies pretended to give you a gift, but they gave themselves and their wealthy patrons much bigger gifts \u2014 and they\u2019re going to stick you with the bill.

Townships have gotten electricity and more modern housing. Government contracts have been set aside for black would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nThese programs have had an impact, improving material conditions and generating jobs.\n\nThey have also been riddled with corruption.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt local governments across South Africa, bureaucrats have abused their authority to steer contracts to companies that put cash in their pockets. At every level of society, people have grown accustomed to kickbacks and political connections determining who prospers, and who goes without.\n\nMr. Zuma\u2019s demise resonates as a sign of a potential new order taking shape. He will forever be linked to his association with the Guptas, three Indian-born brothers who effectively bought key levers of governmental power, amassing influence so comprehensive that it became known as \u201cstate capture.\u201d\n\nHis resignation has raised hopes that South Africa is finally contending with its epidemic of corruption. That view gained momentum when an elite police unit raided a home belonging to the Guptas nearly at the same moment that Mr. Ramaphosa was assuming office.\n\nThe new president is a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle, a former deputy president and chairman of the National Planning Commission, a focal point for thinking about how to engineer economic growth. As a former trade union leader and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Mandela, he enjoys credibility among a range of interest groups, while carrying a reputation as a savvy and strategic operator.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe has had his brushes with controversy, most notably after a 2012 police massacre of striking platinum miners that killed 34 people. At the time, Mr. Ramaphosa occupied a seat on the board of Lonmin, the company that owned the mine. Emails soon surfaced showing that, a day before the police opened fire, Mr. Ramaphosa had been urging senior government officials to take strong action to end the strike.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, no corruption charges have stuck to the new president, who now claims a mandate to clean up the toxic mess left behind by Mr. Zuma.\n\nSome doubt whether the A.N.C. can be salvaged as an effective vehicle for egalitarian policymaking. The party\u2019s executive ranks include many figures implicated in corruption. Mr. Ramaphosa, 65, may champion new initiatives aimed at generating economic growth, yet he finds himself relying on his party brethren to execute his visions, with no certainty that the money will land where intended.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think that taking the president out does much to dismantle the patronage network,\u201d said Ayabonga Cawe, a development economist at Xesibe Holdings, a research and advisory firm in Johannesburg. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need a lot more than taking out the guy at the top.\u201d\n\nAbove all, Mr. Ramaphosa must contend with the structural defects that have long constrained South Africa\u2019s economy, a legacy of apartheid.\n\nBeyond its systemic discrimination against black people, apartheid severed the country from much of the global economy. It ensured that huge numbers of uneducated black South Africans were available at poverty-level wages within major sectors of the economy like mining, agriculture and textiles. That cushioned domestic companies from the pressure to modernize.\n\nPhoto\n\nInternational sanctions isolated South Africa, shielding its firms from competition against multinational rivals. Sanctions also denied South African companies the ability to operate abroad, giving them an incentive to focus on the domestic market. The apartheid-era government obliged with subsidies for favored firms while allowing companies to pursue oligopoly, free of nuisances like antitrust law.\n\nThe result was a system in which large industries, from retail to furniture-making to chemicals, were dominated by huge enterprises whose core strength was the ability to protect themselves against competition. That system has largely prevailed, with smaller companies and start-ups facing often-impossible odds.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cApartheid was a system that lends itself to large conglomerates and concentrations of wealth in the hands of a few,\u201d Mr. Cawe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the corruption. It\u2019s about all of these parallel networks in big business that you need to dismantle. Most of those are white.\u201d\n\nHere is a world that Mr. Ramaphosa knows keenly, having achieved extraordinary affluence by running South African companies with interests in mining, banking, real estate and telecommunications. His fortune has been estimated at $450 million.\n\nIf he is serious about reinvigorating the economy and creating a space for black-owned small businesses, he will need to take on the prevailing structure that made him so wealthy.\n\nHis success on that front may be even more decisive than whether he can tame corruption.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly the most optimistic moment for South Africa in a very long time,\u201d said Mr. Goldin, the former adviser to Mr. Mandela. \u201cIn a way, it does feel like a new beginning.

But Mr. Trump has lagged other presidents in filling executive branch positions, large numbers of posts are still empty, and his White House has seen record-breaking staff turnover.\n\nIn seeking to influence the executive branch, the president is not without help. He relies on what the political scientist John Hart called the \u201cpresidential branch\u201d \u2014 which consists of almost 2,000 staff members, several hundred under the White House proper and the rest in a variety of management organizations (National Security Council, Council of Economic Advisers, Office of Management and Budget) within the Executive Office of the President.\n\nThe advisers in the Executive Office and White House offer the president unbiased information and advice that serve his agenda. At least in theory. In practice, they pose a particular danger to a weak president. The political scientist Jonathan Bernstein has detailed how executive governance suffers in the absence of presidential leadership and can empower rogue policy entrepreneurship. As examples, he points to the policy debacles of Iraq under George W. Bush and the Iran-contra scandal under Ronald Reagan.\n\nThe Executive Office advisers not only have discretion over the information the president receives but also have opportunities to derail presidential proposals before they can even see the light of day.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEffectively managing the White House has been a challenge for all modern presidents. One prerequisite is an ability to articulate a policy vision and persuade senior advisers to develop and carry it out. Mr. Trump\u2019s visible lack of control over the White House is in part rooted in his lack of firm policy beliefs \u2014 about immigration, gun control or foreign policy. Chaos is rampant in the Trump White House largely because the president is weak and easily manipulated by those who have access.\n\nA mismanaged White House, a poor professional reputation and a weak presidency are not impossible to fix. Like Mr. Trump, other first-year presidents have had trouble adapting to the power dynamics of the White House and the Washington community. While some never recovered from disastrous starts (Jimmy Carter), others found their footing and became widely influential over the executive agencies (Bill Clinton).\n\nUnfortunately, the current state of the White House already reflects the most obvious fix Mr. Trump could make: bringing in a more empowered and competent chief of staff. By most accounts, John Kelly had succeeded in improving the information flow, removing some of the key factional actors and reducing the leaks. A more experienced White House hand could probably do better, but at this point it isn\u2019t clear Mr. Trump could attract that sort of A-list talent.\n\nIf the president is unwilling or incapable of getting control of the White House, he will continue to find his reputation lacking and his ability to influence the executive branch minimal. That may be enough for Mr. Trump, who often seems driven by anything but the desire to influence policy.\n\nBut a weak president is not something to cheer.

As a result, the famous comment by the late Tip O\u2019Neill that \u201call politics is local\u201d now seems rather quaint. In the 21st century United States, it increasingly appears that all politics is national.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe practice of voting against rather than for has grown steadily since the 2000 election, but it reached new heights in 2016, when both major party nominees were viewed substantially more negatively than positively.\n\nOn Nov. 7, 2016, the day before the election, 58.5 percent of voters had an unfavorable view of Donald Trump and 54.4 percent felt the same way about Hillary Clinton, according to RealClearPolitics. Favorable views were 37.5 for Trump and 41.8 percent for Clinton.\n\nAbramowitz and Webster compiled data from the 2012 and 2016 elections to show how much the level of anger among both Democratic and Republican voters increased over four years.\n\nIn 2012, 33 percent of Democrats and 43 percent of Republicans described themselves as angry at the opposing party\u2019s presidential candidate \u201cmost of the time\u201d or \u201cjust about always.\u201d In 2016, the percentage of Democratic voters who said they were this angry at Trump rose to 73 percent, and the percentage of Republicans with that level of hostility toward Hillary Clinton rose to 66 percent.\n\nThis trend helps explain seemingly contradictory voter attitudes catalogued in both \u201cAll Politics is National\u201d and a second Abramowitz-Webster paper, \u201cNegative Partisanship: Why Americans Dislike Parties but Behave like Rabid Partisans.\u201d\n\nFrom one vantage point, the view of each major party has steadily worsened. As Abramowitz and Webster point out:\n\nThe percentage of Americans with favorable opinions of both parties is now the lowest it has been since the American National Election Studies began asking this question in 1978.\n\nAt the same time, \u201crecord numbers of voters in 2016 were dissatisfied with their own party\u2019s presidential nominee.\u201d Trump and Clinton\n\nwere the most unpopular major party candidates for president since the ANES introduced the feeling thermometer scale in 1968.\n\nThe \u201cfeeling thermometer scale\u201d asks voters to rank candidates and institutions on a scale of 0 to 100, in which 100 is very warm or favorable, zero is very cold or unfavorable and 50 is neutral or no feeling.\n\nThe accompanying graphic shows that both Democrats and Republicans had favorable views of their own candidates from 1968 to 2012, ranging from 76.5 percent in 1968 to 78.5 percent in 2012. In 2016, however, with Trump and Clinton as the nominees, the thermometer rating dropped sharply to 60.9 percent.\n\nThe Political Winds: Chillier A survey has tracked the average \u201ctemperature\u201d rating given by voters of their own political party\u2019s presidential candidate and the opposing party\u2019s candidate since 1968. 100 (BEST) Own party\u2019s candidate 77 75 56 61 50 (NEUTRAL) The other party\u2019s candidate 25 12 0 (WORST) \u201968 \u201972 \u201976 \u201980 \u201984 \u201988 \u201992 \u201996 \u201900 \u201904 \u201908 \u201912 \u201916\n\nOver the same period, \u201cfeeling thermometer\u201d ratings of the opposition candidate fell sharply, from 56.2 in 1968 to 25.1 in 2012. In 2016, the ratings of the opposition candidate plummeted to 12.2.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDespite the public\u2019s increasingly adverse views of political parties, party loyalty in voting has now reached record levels, according to the two authors. Partisanship currently \u201chas a stronger influence on vote choice than at any time since the 1950s.\u201d\n\nHow can these conflicting trends be reconciled? Voters dislike the parties and are dissatisfied with their candidates, even as they cast straight-ticket ballots. This may sound inconsistent, but it\u2019s not that hard to understand.\n\nAccording to Abramowitz and Webster, in 2016, \u201clarge majorities of Democrats and Republicans truly despised the opposing party\u2019s nominee.\u201d Voters were motivated to go to the polls to cast ballots against the opposition\u2019s nominee much more than to support their own party\u2019s choice. The key factor \u201cin predicting party loyalty in the 2016 presidential election was how voters felt about the opposing party\u2019s presidential candidate.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIn fact, Abramowitz and Webster found that \u201cthis measure was twice as important in predicting loyalty as feelings toward the candidate from one\u2019s own party.\u201d Partisan loyalty remained \u201cvery high because both Democratic and Republican identifiers overwhelmingly viewed the opposing party\u2019s candidate with deep hostility.\u201d\n\nIn the 1970s, about a quarter of all voters split their tickets, voting for presidential and congressional candidates of different parties. Now, not even one in 10 does so. The result:\n\nIn 2016, all 34 Senate elections and 400 of 435 U.S. House elections were won by the party winning the presidential election in the state or district.\n\nIn their analysis of negative partisanship, Iyengar and Krupenkin argue that voting on the basis of hostility has an unexpected consequence: It lessens pressure on the winner to be accountable to his or her supporters, effectively freeing winners to thumb their noses at many of the voters who put them in office:\n\nWhen citizens\u2019 support for a candidate stems primarily from their strong dislike for the opposing candidate, they are less subject to the logic of accountability. Their psychic satisfaction comes more from defeating and humiliating the out-group, and less from any performance or policy benefits that might accrue from the victory of the in-party. For this group of voters, candidates have every incentive to inflame partisan negativity, further entrenching affective polarization.\n\nBy this logic, Iyengar and Krupenkin argue that\n\nIf partisans care less about their own party\u2019s performance and instead focus on their distrust of the opposition party, elected officials no longer need campaign on their own merits; instead, they have good reason to try even harder to denigrate the opposition.\n\nIn other words, Trump critics who anticipate a collapse of support when he fails to deliver on campaign promises are likely to be disappointed. According to Iyengar and Krupenkin,\n\nThe primal sense of \u201cus against them\u201d makes partisans fixate on the goal of defeating and even humiliating the opposition at all costs. This negativity bias in voting behavior undermines traditional theories of electoral accountability that rest on incumbents\u2019 ability to deliver policy and performance benefits.\n\nCandidates and incumbents, Iyengar and Krupenkin continue, \u201care less likely to be sanctioned for demonstrating incompetence, dishonesty and unethical behavior.\u201d\n\nTo make their point, the authors cite Roy Moore, the Republican candidate for Senate in Alabama last December, pointing out that under partisan conditions \u201ca candidate accused of molesting teenage children is able to attract 91 percent of the vote from his copartisans.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat explains the extraordinary level of support for Moore, not only from Republican voters but also from the larger population of white Alabamians, at 68 percent, and conservatives, at 83 percent?\n\nThey can\u2019t all have been happy with their candidate, but a partial answer can be found in a study published last month, \u201cOne Tribe to Bind Them All: How Our Social Group Attachments Strengthen Partisanship,\u201d by Lilliana Mason and Julie Wronski, political scientists at the University of Maryland and the University of Mississippi.\n\nThe authors found that just as the Democratic Party is often described as a collection of identity groups, identity politics have also become a powerful force within the Republican Party. They argue, in fact, that \u201cthis effect is more powerful among Republicans than among Democrats, due to the general social homogeneity of the Republican Party,\u201d with the result that \u201cRepublicans are more susceptible to identity-based politics.\u201d For Republicans,\n\nthe general white, Christian conservative alliance with the party led to a far simpler categorization of who is in the group and who is outside of it.\n\nWhy would this lead to more willingness to vote for someone with as much baggage as Roy Moore? The convergence of voter identification with voters\u2019 social identity \u2014 conservative, white, Christian \u2014 \u201cmakes in-party preference more powerful and out-party tolerance ever more difficult.\u201d\n\nPut another way, Republican doubts about Roy Moore were superseded by hatred of the Democratic Party.\n\nThere is no sign that the growth in negative polarization will slow down, much less reverse itself. The dominant incentive in politics right now is to capitalize on animosity to the opposition party.\n\nAt a time when true swing voters have become a smaller and smaller share of the electorate, hatred, anger and animosity have proven the most effective tools to mobilize support.\n\nBy email, I asked Webster and Iyengar the following question: \u201cDoes negative partisanship override polarization on issues of race, sex, immigration, feminism, traditional family structure, LGBT issues, military spending and policy, etc.?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWebster replied:\n\nI\u2019d be more inclined to say that negative partisanship has helped to perpetuate and exacerbate the degree of partisan polarization that we have in the U.S.\n\nIyengar contended that \u201caffective divergence exceeds policy-related divergence.\u201d A more \u201c \u2018primal\u2019 view of partisanship\u201d has been gaining strength among social scientists, he wrote, noting the discovery\n\nthat children acquired a sense of party identification quite early in the life cycle without any \u201cflickering awareness\u201d of party differences on the issues. Moreover, as people moved through the life cycle, with corresponding changes in economic circumstances and interests, their sense of partisanship was unmoved despite considerable change in their stances on the issues.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, succinctly described the role of negative partisanship in contemporary American politics during a January interview with Michael Lewis: \u201cAnger and fear is what gets people to the polls.\u201d\n\nThe data support Bannon. The Pew Research Center found in June 2016 that the demonization \u2014 vilification \u2014 of political opponents has become entrenched:\n\nToday, sizable shares of both Democrats and Republicans say the other party stirs feelings of not just frustration, but fear (56 percent of Democrats, 49 percent of Republicans) and anger (47 percent Democrats, 46 percent Republicans).\n\nNot only do almost half of Republicans say Democrats are lazier than other Americans, more dishonest (45 percent), more closed-minded (52 percent) and more immoral (47 percent), most (59 percent) also say the members of their own party are more hard-working.\n\nThe Pew findings offer little comfort to those seeking concord. Some 70 percent of Democrats \u201csay that Republicans are more closed-minded than other Americans.\u201d Four out of ten Democrats say \u201cRepublicans are more dishonest,\u201d and a third say Republicans are immoral and unintelligent.\n\nAs partisan conflict increasingly resembles guerrilla warfare, as political opponents despise each other as a matter of routine, the tactic of \u201cenemy construction\u201d takes root. A \u201cfriend-enemy\u201d dichotomy gains strength. Opponents are demonized, defamed, delegitimated and dehumanized \u2014 \u201cjustifying the compromise of ordinarily recognized liberties\u201d\u2014 in the words of RonNell Andersen Jones and Lisa Grow Sun in \u201cEnemy Construction and the Press.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cThe Existential Need for Enemy\u201d Gy\u00f6rgy Csepeli, Zolt\u00e1n V\u00e1gi and Rich\u00e1rd Nagyfi write:\n\nEach party holds negative, stereotypical images of the other stemming from the need to justify the deeds of hostility. The negative and simplified stereotypes are needed in order to simplify the conflict excluding discoveries of similarities between the groups in conflict. The individuals in intergroup conflict systematically tend to misperceive each other to accentuate differences. The resulting images tend to perpetuate negative stereotypes of each other containing oversimplified, inaccurate and derogatory beliefs concerning the other group that are identified as the enemies.\n\nJust as adversaries are denigrated, allies are praised:\n\nThe image of self, in contrast, reflects glorification of everyone who is alike. A mirror image emerges in which each party sees the other one negatively and itself positively. On the basis of the overgeneralized difference stemming from the categorization into in-group and out-group, the group members in each group necessarily will be pushed into the labyrinth of cognitive biases which are the cornerstones of the hostile image of the other.\n\nAs politics become a form of mortal combat, a strange burden falls on those who are most engaged. In the words of the conservative German jurist and political theorist Carl Schmitt \u2014 who as a supporter of the Third Reich knew something about hatred \u2014 the combatants must, as he wrote in \u201cThe Theory of the Partisan,\u201d\n\nconsider the other side as entirely criminal and inhuman, as totally worthless. Otherwise they are themselves criminal and inhuman. The logic of value and its obverse, worthlessness, unfolds its annihilating consequence, compelling ever new, ever deeper discriminations, criminalizations, and devaluations to the point of annihilating all of unworthy life.\n\nIt is not too much to say that a significant number of voters in both of America\u2019s major political parties see their adversaries as worthless.

Reacting to Charen\u2019s CPAC appearance, one right-wing writer for Red State called her \u201ca new voice in the wilderness of insignificance\u201d \u2014 and then devoted 1,000 words to underscoring that insignificance.\n\nThis is not, at root, ideological critique. It\u2019s the sign of a bad conscience. The 2016 primaries showed that NeverTrumpers were never much of a political force in the G.O.P.

NeverTrumpers haunt the conservative movement the way Polish or Czech dissident intellectuals such as Czeslaw Milosz and Vaclav Havel haunted that segment of Central European intelligentsia that made its peace with Stalinism after World War II.\n\nThe Trumpers (and Stalinists) traded conscience for power; the NeverTrumpers and dissidents chose the reverse. Conscience can be made to suffer, but in the end it usually wins.\n\nThat\u2019s why NeverTrumpers matter; why the Trumpers know they matter (which they prove every time they feverishly assert the opposite); and why progressives who dismiss NeverTrumpers as politically irrelevant are wrong. The United States is going to have a right-of-center party in one form or another, and it matters a great deal whether that party is liberal or illiberal, capable or incapable of shame.\n\nCredible conservatives like Charen can still make a positive difference in that respect, in a way that people like, say, Elizabeth Warren cannot. That\u2019s why you want good guys on the other side of the partisan divide, no matter how irrelevant they currently appear to be. When Trumpism fails, as it inevitably will, who will be the Republican Adenauer?\n\nI write this as a parallel contest is taking shape within the Democratic Party, most visibly in the rift between traditional liberals and the social-justice warriors of what used to be the far left. Dianne Feinstein\u2019s failure this week to claim her party\u2019s nomination for the Senate seat she\u2019s held since 1992 is another depressing indication that the rift is widening.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne side believes in the power of reason, the possibility of persuasion, and the values of the Enlightenment. It champions social solidarity for the sake of empowering the individual, rather than creating a society of conformists. It doesn\u2019t see compromise as a dirty word. Its belief in the benefits of civility and diversity does not override its commitment to free speech and independent thought.\n\nAs for the other side, it thinks it knows what\u2019s True. It considers compromise knavish. It views debate \u2014 beyond its own tightly set parameters \u2014 as either pointless or dangerous. And while it sees itself as the antithesis of Trumpism, it is, in its raging intolerance and smug self-satisfaction, Trumpism\u2019s mirror image.\n\nMy advice to traditional liberals is not to repeat the establishment Republican mistake of not taking the threat of populist illiberalism seriously, and of not fighting it fiercely. The fabric of an open society is more frayed than most people realize, and it is coming unraveled from more than one end. What happened to the G.O.P. in 2016 could happen to the Democrats in 2020.\n\nThe good news, as Charen courageously reminded us, is that these fights should never be abandoned even when they seem lost, and that sometimes the fights most worth having are those with our own side.

But Mr. Frederick is not only a member of the Supreme Court bar\u2019s elite inner circle \u2014 a position once shared by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. \u2014 but also the author of a how-to book, \u201cSupreme Court and Appellate Advocacy,\u201d widely regarded as a kind of bible on the subject. In the book, originally published in 2003 and now in a second edition, he describes the \u201cnimbleness in maintaining focus\u201d that\u2019s necessary for \u201cfending off hostile questions that threaten to undermine the case.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo Justice Kennedy\u2019s \u201cgotcha\u201d question, he replied coolly, \u201cIt is not the end of the case, Your Honor, because that is not the question.\u201d To Justice Alito\u2019s dystopian vision of unions pushing cities into bankruptcy, he said, \u201cI would say \u2014 and there are briefs on our side that make this very clear \u2014 that that particular hypothetical, in fact, is an unfair smearing of the collective bargaining process.\u201d\n\nThen there was a colloquy with Justice Alito, who asked what the consequences would be if a state labor law included lobbying as part of the union\u2019s collective bargaining activities, thus making its lobbying expenses chargeable to nonmembers.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018lobbying,\u2019 Justice Alito?\u201d Mr. Frederick asked.\n\nJustice Alito: \u201cWell, is there any limit on what states can make a mandatory subject of collective bargaining? So if the test is whether it\u2019s mandated by the state, the state can make anything it wants a mandatory subject of bargaining.\u201d\n\nMr. Frederick pushed back to a degree not often seen in the courtroom: \u201cJustice Alito, I would say that that hypothetical is so far outside of what this case is really all about that if you think that there\u2019s a problem, that if any state ever in the Union would come up with some requirement like that as part of collective bargaining, you have the opportunity to review it at this time.\u201d It was the lawyer\u2019s way of saying: You know what you\u2019re going to do, and so do I, and I can\u2019t stop you but I\u2019m not going to play this game with you.\n\nTrying to understand the unseemly anger radiating from the bench, I came up with two theories. Under one theory, the anti-union justices are simply angry at having to go through this exercise again when they came so close two years ago, with victory snatched from them by Justice Scalia\u2019s death.\n\nIn my second theory, these justices are responding to accounts in the press and elsewhere of the intensely political nature of this case, financed by right-wing donors who have spent years looking for an opportunity to cripple organized labor. A brief filed in the case by two Democratic senators, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, is unusually explicit in recounting how \u201cthis case is not only bizarre in its procedural history, it is part of a broader special-interest campaign spanning multiple cases that departs from the ordinary course of litigation in multiple ways.\u201d\n\nThis remarkable brief reproduces a fund-raising letter from one group, the Freedom Foundation, which proclaims that thanks to this case and specifically to the arrival of Justice Gorsuch, \u201cThe Supreme Court is about to hand us the opportunity of a lifetime.\u201d The letter adds that \u201cwe\u2019ve been pointing toward this moment for our entire existence\u201d and asks for financial help \u201cto take advantage of the expected 5-4 decision for freedom.\u201d The two senators \u2014 one of whom, Senator Blumenthal, was once a Supreme Court law clerk \u2014 tell the justices that \u201cthese bold predictions, which can only taint the court\u2019s institutional standing, surely must disconcert any member of the public who cares about the judiciary\u2019s impartiality.\u201d\n\nConfronted with such briefs and articles, some judges might pull back and think twice about overturning a 40-year-old precedent for reasons so obviously grounded in policy rather than law. But if the effort was to shame the five justices who now hold the upper hand, I think it most likely backfired. The voice that came through to me was one that said: \u201cOh, yeah? Save your breath. We\u2019ve got the votes and \u2014 in case you\u2019ve forgotten \u2014 life tenure besides.\u201d", "keywords": ["labor", "supreme", "justice", "unions", "kennedy", "court", "political", "power", "courts", "alito", "case", "justices", "play", "frederick"], "polarity": 0.04908820346320347, "subjectivity": 0.3705733557378295},

Known as The Kerner Commission, after the chair, Otto Kerner, seated at the head of the table, the group was convened by President Lyndon Johnson in the wake of the 1967 race riots. Fred Harris is the second person to the right of Kerner. Underwood Archives/Getty Images\n\n\u201cOur nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white \u2013 separate and unequal.\u201d\n\nFifty years ago, on March 1, 1968, these were the grim words of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, called the Kerner Commission after its chairman, Gov. Otto Kerner of Illinois.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson had established the commission to examine the disorders and violent protests in Detroit, Newark and well over 100 other American cities during the summer of 1967, and earlier. What it found was searing. \u201cWhat white Americans have never fully understood \u2013 but what the Negro can never forget \u2013 is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto,\u201d the commission concluded. \u201cWhite institutions created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it.\u201d\n\nMostly moderate and mostly white men, the members of the bipartisan panel carried the imprimatur of the political establishment. Their recommendations attracted widespread public debate. The paperback edition of the report sold over two million copies.\n\nOccupied by the Vietnam War and concerned about the legacy of his Great Society domestic agenda, Johnson distanced himself from the \u201ctwo societies\u201d warning. But the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Robert Kennedy strongly endorsed the commission\u2019s findings and recommendations before they were assassinated and before more protests erupted during that traumatic year of 1968.\n\nThe Kerner Commission recommended \u201cmassive and sustained\u201d investments in jobs and education to reduce poverty, inequality and racial injustice. Have we made progress in the last 50 years?\n\nA Return to Segregation\n\nIn many ways, things have gotten no better \u2014 or have gotten worse \u2014 since 1968.

The overall poverty rate remains about the same today as it was 50 years ago; the total number of poor people has increased from over 25 million to well over 40 million, more than the population of California.\n\nMeanwhile, the rich have profited at the expense of most working Americans. Today, the top 1 percent receive 52 percent of all new income. Rich people are healthier and live longer. They get a better education, which produces greater gains in income. And their greater economic power translates into greater political power.\n\nFive Indicators America of the 1960s contrasted with the most recent available data.

At a rally in San Diego, Mr. Trump called Judge Curiel \u201cvery hostile,\u201d \u201ca very bad judge\u201d and a \u201chater of Donald Trump,\u201d and said he \u201cshould be ashamed of himself. I think it\u2019s a disgrace that he\u2019s doing this.\u201d\n\nHe added that Judge Curiel \u201chappens to be, we believe, Mexican.\u201d Not true: Judge Curiel was born and raised in Indiana. But the implication, of course, was that Mr. Trump, who had begun his own candidacy with derogatory comments about Mexicans and had been pushing a border wall with Mexico throughout the campaign, could not get a fair trial from a \u201cMexican\u201d judge.\n\nLess than two years later, in a case involving the border wall itself, that same judge ruled in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor. He is no longer a \u201cvery bad judge,\u201d apparently.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Mr. Trump simply forgot who Judge Curiel is. More likely, he knows full well and doesn\u2019t care. What he cares about is protecting his delicate ego, and repairing any damage to it inflicted by people who don\u2019t show a sufficient degree of respect or self-abasement. This all-consuming self-interest leads him to change his opinion of people and institutions, depending on how he thinks they are treating him at that moment.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

This is a man who is so much more interested in winning than in governing that he filed for re-election the same day he was inaugurated. It\u2019s the core of who he is, as almost anyone who has had even a glancing dealing with him over the years \u2014 especially in real estate, where nothing matters but the sale \u2014 will attest. If you help him or say nice things about him, you\u2019re the best. If you get in his way or criticize him, you\u2019re unfair, dishonest, terrible. Failing, even.\n\nAsk \u201cLiddle\u201d Bob Corker, the Tennessee senator who earned Mr. Trump\u2019s outrage by criticizing the Republican tax bill, then seemed to get back on the president\u2019s good side with a few empathetic words. Or Senator John McCain, who is dealing with terminal brain cancer even as Mr. Trump keeps mocking him for his vote last year against repealing Obamacare. Or Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s first and most ardent supporter in the Senate, but who has secured a spot in the president\u2019s doghouse after recusing himself from the Russia investigation. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump fired yet another broadside at Mr. Sessions, complaining that his failure to investigate alleged abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is \u201cdisgraceful\u201d \u2014 in all caps, naturally.\n\nNone of this is remotely surprising anymore, but even so, Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet about Judge Curiel\u2019s border-wall decision revealed once again the depths of the president\u2019s own self-interest and his utter lack of principles. When this is the driving force of the commander in chief, and it is aimed at our governmental and social institutions, it is profoundly destructive.\n\nShortly after the 2016 rally where he disparaged the competence, integrity and ethnicity of Judge Curiel, Mr. Trump was asked why he did not just settle the Trump University case and be done with it. After predicting that he would win outright, he said: \u201cI could settle that case. \u2026 I don\u2019t want to settle the case. Because you know what? Because I\u2019m a man of principle.\u201d (In November 2016, days after he won the election, Mr. Trump settled, eventually paying $25 million.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFortunately, as this tale reveals, there are in fact still people of principle in public service, and they\u2019re doing important work every day to preserve our institutions and counteract this president\u2019s worst impulses.\n\nJudge Curiel, for one, has continued to do his job, carefully applying the law to the cases that come before him, no matter how obnoxious the litigants might be. In his ruling on Tuesday, the judge acknowledged the \u201cheated political debate\u201d surrounding the border wall, and quoted a passage on the role of courts by Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. \u2014 who, he slyly noted, is a \u201cfellow Indiana native\u201d: \u201cCourts are vested with the authority to interpret the law; we possess neither the expertise nor the prerogative to make policy judgments. Those decisions are entrusted to our nation\u2019s elected leaders, who can be thrown out of office if the people disagree with them. It is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices.\u201d\n\nThat is what being a public servant in America sounds like, and it requires a level of selflessness and devotion to democratic ideals that is alien to Mr. Trump.", "keywords": ["donald", "mr", "presidents", "wall", "gets", "bad", "judge", "settle", "youre", "trump", "case", "trumps", "lesson", "curiel"], "polarity": 0.05941592798735657, "subjectivity": 0.48102109530680964},

Zinke has bid adieu to five-sixths of the unpaid members of the National Park System Advisory Board \u2014 although it\u2019s not actually clear that Zinke knows they\u2019re gone, since he refused to meet with them.\n\n\u201cIt is SO tough to pick one,\u201d moaned a voter torn between Pruitt and Zinke.\n\nBoth men seem to have a particular obsession with flying in style. Pruitt\u2019s round-the-clock security detail has conveniently decided that it\u2019s dangerous for him to sit in coach. Their concern for the dangers he might encounter crammed in with the rank-and-file was so intense that Pruitt felt compelled to spend $1,641 of public money to sit up front on an exhausting one-hour flight from Washington to New York.\n\nWhat is it with these people and travel?\n\nYou\u2019ll remember at one point Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin tried to get a government plane for his honeymoon. The first head of Health and Human Services was canned because of his penchant for high-end transport. But Pruitt, unfazed, is still being spotted in first-class seating.\n\nWe the taxpayers paid for a $36,000 military flight to get Pruitt from Cincinnati to New York on one occasion when he felt particularly pressed for time. The trip was to promote infrastructure improvements, and the money the government spent just getting Pruitt out of Ohio could have paid for paving cracks in approximately 110 square miles of road.\n\nPruitt needs special seating, the E.P.A. claims, because other travelers have begun to verbally assault him in the airports. On the one side we have a guy accompanied by guards, in an enclosed space inhabited only by people who have walked through metal detectors. On the other side there\u2019s the danger of being yelled at by an environmentalist. Obviously, no price for protection is too high.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nZinke, whose department is considering a plan to more than double the entrance fee to the Grand Canyon, spent $6,250 to helicopter back from a meeting in Virginia so he could make a date to go horseback riding with Mike Pence.

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/opinion/jared-kushner-conspiracy-fraud.html", "text": "There has already been ample reporting suggesting that Mr. Kushner may have done just that. During a period when Mr. Kushner was negotiating President Trump\u2019s first visit to China, his family business was trying to sell a debt-ridden property in New York to an insurance company with ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Public scrutiny of the deal scuttled it. Last May, The New York Times described how, immediately after the Trump administration extended a visa program for wealthy investors, Mr. Kushner\u2019s sister invoked Mr. Kushner in a presentation seeking Chinese investment in one of the family\u2019s New Jersey real estate developments.\n\nSuch appearances of conflict might not, by themselves, get Mr. Kushner in trouble. The president has broad authority to set the country\u2019s foreign policy, and public corruption laws have been far more difficult to enforce after a 2016 Supreme Court decision overturning the conviction of the former Virginia governor Robert McDonnell on bribery charges.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

When the national security adviser, H. R. McMaster, learned of some of Mr. Kushner\u2019s communications only after the fact, he was surprised, one official told The Post, and thought it was \u201cweird.\u201d\n\nMr. Kushner has been famously tardy in disclosing his business interests and ties with foreigners in his application for a security clearance. He was still making updates to his forms as recently as January. That means he has conducted an entire year of foreign policy without officially disclosing all the personal interests he may have been serving.\n\nFinally, the risk might be greater still if Mr. Kushner negotiated such deals before Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. That\u2019s the possibility raised by Mr. Kushner\u2019s pre-inauguration meetings with Russia. In December 2016, Mr. Kushner met with Sergey Gorkov, the head of a bank under American sanctions, Vnesheconombank. That meeting came after Mr. Kushner suggested a back channel of communications in a meeting with Russia\u2019s ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, according to Mr. Kislyak.\n\nNor did Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team alert the Obama administration before Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates visited New York in December 2016 for a meeting involving Mr. Kushner and others at Trump Tower.\n\nWhile the proper authorities may not have been informed of this series of meetings, Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser who pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators late last year, did attend or at least knew of them. Steve Bannon, who recently sat for 20 hours of interviews with special counsel prosecutors, participated in the Zayed Trump Tower meeting along with Mr. Flynn and Mr. Kushner. So if they are a concern to Mr. Mueller, he has recently gotten far more details of what happened at the meetings.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Kushner\u2019s defense attorney, Abbe Lowell, has been very forthcoming with the press. But he seems to have relied on the same on-the-record quotation since Feb. 16, when news first broke that Mr. Kushner might lose his interim security clearance. Twelve days ago, a statement from Mr. Lowell to The Washington Post directly addressed the gist of the story that just broke Tuesday. Mr. Kushner\u2019s job, Mr. Lowell said, was \u201cto talk with foreign officials,\u201d which, he added, Mr. Kushner has done \u201cproperly.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Mr. Kushner is just a person who had no idea what he was doing and wanted to improve his and his family\u2019s finances. Still, there are many reasons to question whether he has talked with foreign officials with the proper disclosures, designed to ensure that those claiming to represent the interests of the United States aren\u2019t hiding their own interests or those of foreign governments.\n\nIn pursuing his investigation into Russian tampering, Mr. Mueller appears to be doing something more: restoring the regulatory teeth to ensure that those engaging in American politics are doing what they publicly claim they are. If Mr. Mueller extends this effort to foreign policy, Mr. Kushner may be in real trouble.", "keywords": ["mr", "policy", "united", "jared", "interests", "defraud", "security", "meeting", "foreign", "america", "conspired", "kushner", "kushners", "york"], "polarity": 0.061227642971064034, "subjectivity": 0.37828021758942815}
