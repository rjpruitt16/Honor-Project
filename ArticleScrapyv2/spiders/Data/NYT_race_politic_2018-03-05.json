{"title": "\n                    Trump Administration Delays Decision on Scaling Back Medicaid in Arkansas                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/health/trump-medicaid-arkansas.html", "text": "\u201cWe are ready with our systems,\u201d Mr. Hutchinson said, noting the state had been preparing for more than a year. \u201cThis will be going fairly quickly.\u201d\n\nThe Arkansas work requirements are somewhat softer than those of the other two states. People younger than 50 will be expected to work, or to train or search for jobs; attend school full time or volunteer \u2014 80 hours a month. Kentucky and Indiana are imposing the requirement on people younger than 65 and 60, respectively. But Arkansas\u2019s plan has harsher consequences for not meeting the requirement: those who do not comply for three months out of a year will be locked out of coverage until the following year.\n\n\u201cThis is not about punishing anyone,\u201d Mr. Hutchinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s about giving people an opportunity to work. It\u2019s about giving them the training they need. It\u2019s about helping them move out of poverty and up the economic ladder.\u201d\n\nSo far, only one other state, Massachusetts, has joined Arkansas in seeking permission to roll back its Medicaid expansion, and make the program available only to people with incomes below the federal poverty level: $12,060 for a single person, or about twice that amount for a family of four. Under the terms of the Affordable Care Act, states that chose to expand Medicaid had to provide it to everyone with incomes up to 138 percent of that level: $16,642 for a single person.\n\nBut if the Trump administration allows Arkansas to scale back its Medicaid expansion population, some of the other 31 states that expanded the program will likely want to follow, as a way to save money and appease conservative legislators who think the Obamacare expansion went too far. Other states may be tempted to expand Medicaid, after holding back for years, if they can limit it to those earning at or below the poverty level. The federal government initially paid the full cost of the expansion, but now states are on the hook for 6 percent of the cost; their share will gradually grow to 10 percent over the next few years.\n\nThe Arkansas proposal would move about 60,000 people out of the program, by lowering the income threshold to the federal poverty level.\n\nMr. Hutchinson wants those earning between 100 and 138 percent of the poverty level to move to the Affordable Care Act marketplace, where they would get federal subsidies to buy private insurance. But that could end up costing the federal government more money \u2014 another reason the Trump administration may be slow to approve it. President Trump frequently refers to the marketplaces as \u201cfailing\u201d and has taken a number of steps to weaken them.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The state uses federal Medicaid funds to buy private insurance for the poor \u2014 an alternative that conservative Republicans found acceptable when it was first passed in 2013. About 285,000 people are now enrolled in the Medicaid expansion.\n\nCindy Gillespie, the director of the Arkansas Department of Human Services, said the state was planning to activate an online portal on March 30 where those subject to the requirement will be expected to record how they\u2019re meeting it each month. In June, the state will start phasing it in, relying largely on its Department of Workforce services to connect job seekers with employment, education or training.\n\nKentucky, for its part, is sending out the first notices about its work requirement this week and plans to start rolling it out in July. Indiana will not roll out its work requirement until next year.\n\nLike Kentucky and Indiana, Arkansas will exempt people who qualify as \u201cmedically frail\u201d from the work requirement, as well as those who are pregnant, in treatment for substance abuse, in school full time or caring for children or someone incapacitated. Nor will those who qualified for Medicaid before the Obamacare expansion \u2014 children and disabled or elderly adults \u2014 be subject to it.\n\nOnly people from the ages of 30 through 49 will be subject to the requirement this year, and state officials have estimated that about 60 percent of them \u2014 59,714 out of 98,632 \u2014 either work already or will qualify for exemptions.\n\nYounger enrollees, down to the age of 19, will be subject to the work requirement starting next year.\n\nThe National Health Law Program, a nonprofit advocacy group that has already sued to stop Kentucky\u2019s work requirement, said Monday that Arkansas\u2019s also \u201cappears well outside the bounds of the limited authority\u201d that the Department of Health and Human Services has to change Medicaid provisions.\n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s work requirement program, beyond being legally suspect, will disproportionately harm the most underserved populations,\u201d said Jane Perkins, the program\u2019s legal director.", "keywords": ["expansion", "decision", "services", "delays", "trump", "work", "requirement", "states", "federal", "state", "administration", "program", "arkansas", "medicaid", "scaling"], "polarity": 0.06289888030394358, "subjectivity": 0.3546281074762087},

If he does not take the seat, the governor is expected to consider Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, who is also thought to want to run for governor when Mr. Bryant becomes term-limited in 2019, and Secretary of State Delbert Hoseman. Other possibilities include the State House speaker, Philip Gun, and the state auditor, Stacey Pickering.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDemocrats have not won a Senate race in Mississippi since 1982, when the veteran Senator John Stennis defeated Haley Barbour, but state and national Republicans worry about whether their grip on the state\u2019s two seats could be in peril should Mr. McDaniel find success. Last week, David Baria, the State House Democratic leader, announced his intention to run for Mr. Wicker\u2019s seat. Democrats have also wooed Brandon Presley, a cousin to Elvis Presley and the chairman of the state\u2019s Public Service Commission, to run for the Senate.\n\nMike Espy, a former Democratic congressman and agriculture secretary in the Clinton administration, said late Monday that he would consider running for Mr. Cochran\u2019s seat.\n\nMr. Espy, who is African-American and from a prominent Delta family, could be a formidable candidate in a state where black voters make up much of the Democratic Party.\n\nDemocrats are watching which race Mr. McDaniel chooses, hoping to put their most formidable candidate against the state senator.\n\nMr. Cochran has been a genteel presence in the Senate for decades, but in recent years his physical decline has become apparent. On Monday, as the Senate voted on two judicial nominations, he was guided into the chamber by aides and was silent as reporters peppered him with questions.\n\nHis decision to leave opens up the coveted chairman\u2019s spot on the Senate Appropriations Committee, where leadership is determined by seniority.

Bush who is close to the speaker. \u201cI think in a lot of ways he was forced into a defensive posture rather than an offensive posture.\u201d\n\nTo supporters like Mr. Wehner, Mr. Ryan\u2019s approach is pure pragmatism and smart politics. Facing a divided Republican conference and a mercurial president of his party, they say, he has little choice but to curb some of his own instincts, work behind the scenes and steer Mr. Trump gently. He also must guide House Republicans into a very difficult midterm election campaign, where his main job is to ensure that vulnerable members get re-elected. And those close to Mr. Ryan note that, with the exception of trade, he has not had serious policy disagreements with the president.\n\nBut Mr. Ryan had modeled himself as a different kind of leader, the youthful face of a new brand of conservatism that was to broaden his party\u2019s appeal and move it beyond 1980s-style Reaganism. His 2012 run for vice president lifted his national profile and fortified his standing. So to critics, the leader once described as \u201cthe intellectual center of Republicans in the House\u201d has abandoned principles to hang onto a job he ostensibly never wanted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of saying deep in his heart there is a different Paul Ryan,\u201d said Charles J. Sykes, a conservative commentator and former radio host in Mr. Ryan\u2019s home state of Wisconsin, who for years promoted Mr. Ryan as a potential presidential candidate.\n\nConservative critiques of Mr. Trump, from senators such as Jeff Flake of Arizona and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, have gone beyond policy disagreements, to temperament, defenses of democratic institutions and law enforcement, and the conduct of foreign policy. And other Republican leaders are speaking out. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, is giving almost daily speeches on the Senate floor pushing for action on a modest but bipartisan bill to fortify the existing background check system for gun purchases.\n\nSenator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Finance Committee and a loud supporter of Mr. Trump, nonetheless scorched his tariffs as \u201ca tax hike the American people don\u2019t need and can\u2019t afford.\u201d\n\nMr. Ryan has repeatedly urged Mr. Trump to abandon the tariffs in private, according to one person familiar with their conversations. In public, he has held his tongue. He declined to be interviewed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI always imagined that there was room for an alternative conservative vision to Trumpism, and Paul Ryan was ideally suited to be that leader of a non-Trumpist conservative Republican Party, but he\u2019s chosen not to assume that role,\u201d Mr. Sykes said. \u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing to see he\u2019s become so comfortable as an ally and an enabler of Trump.\u201d\n\nFor Democrats, the speaker\u2019s deference to Mr. Trump is the stuff of ridicule \u2014 and a constitutional dereliction of duty by the man three steps from the presidency.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine Tip O\u2019Neill or Sam Rayburn or any of the portraits in this gallery saying, \u2018I don\u2019t know whether I can be for that, I\u2019ve got to go down the street and ask permission of the president\u2019?\u201d asked Representative Anna G. Eshoo, Democrat of California, referring to previous speakers whose portraits hang just outside the House chamber.\n\nTo be sure, Mr. Ryan has had some achievements, notably the rewrite of the federal tax code, which for the speaker marked the realization of a long-held dream. He pushed a repeal of the Affordable Care Act through the House, only to see it die in the Senate. And he helped negotiate a two-year budget deal that should bring some peace to Washington even as it balloons federal spending.\n\n\u201cSpeaker Ryan has taken on all the challenges of the modern speakership and deftly kept the conference united while advancing an historic conservative agenda,\u201d said Mr. Ryan\u2019s spokeswoman, AshLee Strong. She cited in particular the tax code rewrite and the budget deal\u2019s provisions for \u201cthe rebuilding of our depleted military.\u201d\n\nMr. Ryan has not always been so deferential. When Mr. Trump attacked a Mexican-American judge during the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Ryan called the comments the \u201ctextbook definition of a racist comment.\u201d When the infamous Access Hollywood tape came out, showing Mr. Trump boasting of sexually assaulting women, Mr. Ryan saw to it that Mr. Trump was disinvited to a rally in Wisconsin.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re from entirely different worlds,\u201d Mr. Wehner said. \u201cThat said, Ryan knows he has to deal with Trump, and Trump has probably figured out he has to rely on Ryan.\u201d\n\nNow 48, Mr. Ryan became the youngest speaker since 1869 when he was elected to the post in the fall of 2015, replacing John A. Boehner, who was effectively pushed out by conservatives in his unruly conference. Mr. Ryan told his colleagues then that he would accept the speakership only if all factions would unite behind him.\n\nTo a certain extent, he has succeeded.\n\nBut in the name of unity, he has governed with a light hand. Last month, the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee confronted Mr. Ryan after they concluded that the House Intelligence Committee had leaked a senator\u2019s private texts \u2014 a serious breach of protocol. Although the senators raised concerns about the direction of the committee under its chairman, Devin Nunes of California, Mr. Ryan apparently chose not to intervene.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe speaker heard the senators on their concerns and encouraged them to take them up directly with their counterparts,\u201d said his spokeswoman, Ms. Strong.\n\nIf Mr. Ryan is known for one quality, House Republicans say, it is his willingness to listen. Members of his conference view him as \u201cinclusive and fair,\u201d said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania.\n\nBut in a chamber where 218 votes are required to pass legislation, Mr. Ryan still faces the same fundamental problem as his predecessor: He has difficulty bringing his fractious conference together. That means he must watch his step.\n\nUnlike Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader, who was speaker from 2007 to 2011, he is not a forceful presence in the House chamber. As speaker, Ms. Pelosi ruled the House with an iron fist, guiding dozens of bills large and small into law. She engineered passage of even doomed bills like a climate change bill that died in the Senate \u2014 and likely cost Democrats seats in the 2010 Republican landslide. She emerged as the undisputable face of her caucus, to some members\u2019 chagrin.\n\nThat is not Mr. Ryan\u2019s style.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for anyone be a strong speaker in the traditional sense around here because the speaker is only as strong as his conference allows him to be,\u201d Mr. Dent said. \u201cAnd because on many issues the speaker cannot get 218 Republican votes, that weakens his position.\u201d\n\nApart from the tax overhaul, that has made for narrow legislative proposals. With Republicans under intense pressure to address gun violence after the high school massacre in Parkland, Fla., Mr. Ryan swatted away any suggestion last week that the House would take expansive action.\n\nThe chamber has already adopted a measure to make modest changes to the national instant background check database, coupled with a measure pushed by the gun lobby to expand the reach of concealed weapons permits. The speaker said Republican leaders now are waiting for the Senate to act.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to micromanage this,\u201d he said at a news conference.\n\nBut there are consequences to Mr. Ryan\u2019s low-key style. Big issues like immigration are languishing with no resolution in sight. Causes that were once Mr. Ryan\u2019s signature fights \u2014 an exploding budget deficit, soaring Medicare and Social Security spending and an entrenched welfare state \u2014 are on nobody\u2019s must-do list. Even Mr. Boehner, never viewed as a policymaking powerhouse, at least tried to negotiate a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with the White House that was to slow entitlement spending, cut other parts of the government and raise revenue to balance the budget.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Ryan\u2019s break with Mr. Trump on trade came only after several other Republicans made clear that they were not standing by the president. Republicans are running for re-election on the strength of the economy, hoping that voters credit their policies, especially the tax cuts. But a trade war marked by a spike in consumer prices could jeopardize their survival strategy.\n\nTo Representative Brian Mast, Republican of Florida and a combat veteran who lost both his legs in Afghanistan, Mr. Ryan\u2019s suggestion that the House wait for the Senate to act on guns is not good enough after the Parkland slaughter.\n\n\u201cIf we believe that tax reform is a do-or-die issue that we have to get done but we can\u2019t say that protecting our kids is that same kind of issue, then that\u2019s not leadership,\u201d said Mr. Mast, who backed an assault weapons ban after the bloodshed in Parkland.\n\nConservatives, meanwhile, have put Mr. Ryan on notice that he does not have free rein. Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, was instrumental in the ouster of Mr. Boehner, and he suggested last month that a misstep on immigration in particular could cost Mr. Ryan his job.\n\n\u201cI can say that it is a defining moment for this speaker,\u201d Mr. Meadows said then. \u201cIf he gets it wrong, it will have consequences for him.\u201d", "keywords": ["ryans", "gingerly", "wields", "speaker", "tax", "republican", "mr", "trump", "paul", "ryan", "speakers", "gavel", "outspoken", "house", "senate", "republicans"], "polarity": 0.06498809204561418, "subjectivity": 0.5022628305814147},

The president seems unlikely to come up with a plan more acceptable than those that have been rejected in the past, Mr. Revivi said, and \u201che doesn\u2019t want to fail where others have failed.\u201d\n\nThe meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu, their fifth since the president\u2019s inauguration 13 months ago, demonstrated just how close the two have become while the Palestinians remain off at a distance. The two celebrated Mr. Trump\u2019s decision in December to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and move the American Embassy there from Tel Aviv in defiance of much of the rest of the world.\n\nMr. Netanyahu extolled Mr. Trump for the decision, comparing him to three of the most important figures in the history of the Jewish people: King Cyrus of Persia, who 2,500 years ago freed the Jews from exile in Babylon and permitted them to return to Jerusalem; Lord Arthur James Balfour, the British foreign secretary whose declaration in 1917 first paved the way for a Jewish homeland in Palestine; and President Harry S. Truman, who recognized Israel\u2019s existence 11 minutes after it declared independence in 1948.\n\nJust as Israelis remember those historical figures, Mr. Netanyahu said, \u201cwe remember how a few weeks ago President Donald J. Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. President,\u201d he continued, \u201cthis will be remembered by our people through the ages. As you just said, others talked about it. You did it.\u201d\n\nUnlike Mr. Trump, however, Mr. Netanyahu mentioned the goal of peace with the Palestinians only in passing and focused instead on the topic he always makes his top priority when he visits Washington, namely Iran.\n\nHe hoped to use the visit to encourage Mr. Trump to tear up President Barack Obama\u2019s agreement with Tehran limiting its nuclear program or renegotiate it to toughen its provisions, particularly with respect to ballistic missiles. He also sought consensus on how to counter Iran\u2019s presence in Syria.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIran must be stopped,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said. \u201cThat is our common challenge.\u201d\n\nHe voiced deep skepticism about the prospect of a Palestinian state, recalling how Gaza fell under the control of Hamas after Israel withdrew. \u201cYou can bring models, theoretical models, say it will be good if we give them a state,\u201d he told the reporters. \u201cEmpirically, it doesn\u2019t work with what we see. When we leave land, terror organizations take it up. Immediately.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump, by contrast, was still more interested in seeking what he has called \u201cthe ultimate deal\u201d between Israel and the Palestinians. \u201cWe\u2019re working on it very hard,\u201d he said with Mr. Netanyahu at his side in the Oval Office. \u201cLook, it would be a great achievement even from a humanitarian standpoint. What better if we could make peace between Israel and the Palestinians? And I can tell you, we\u2019re working very hard on doing that and I think we have a good chance.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In response to the president\u2019s Jerusalem move, they declared that they no longer saw the United States as a neutral broker with the Israelis. Mr. Trump then withheld $65 million in aid for Palestinian refugees.\n\nBut Mr. Kushner went to the United Nations recently to hear Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian leader, speak in an effort to show respect shortly after the president publicly pressed Israel on settlement construction in the West Bank.\n\nThe Monday meeting came at a time when both Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu are under increasing domestic pressure from investigations bearing down on them and their families. Shortly before their get-together, Mr. Trump was lashing out at the investigation into whether his team cooperated with Russia during the 2016 election, while reports from Israel indicated that a former confidant of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s had made a deal with the police in a corruption investigation of the prime minister.\n\n\u201cThey have an awful lot in common and they both may be desperately in need of a friend and someone who understands what they\u2019re going through,\u201d said Mara Rudman, a former deputy special envoy for Middle East peace under Mr. Obama. \u201cAnd they happen to be showing it for the world to see.\u201d\n\nMr. Netanyahu later said their mutual woes \u2014 they both use the phrase \u201cwitch hunt\u201d to describe the inquiries into their activities \u2014 never came up during their meeting. Instead, they relished the chance to showcase their partnership during the part of their session when cameras were on.\n\n\u201cThe relationship has never been better,\u201d Mr. Trump declared.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been stronger,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu agreed.\n\nMr. Trump has made his decision to move the embassy a selling point among his supporters, lauding it during a recent speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference as one of his major achievements. His administration announced that it would formally open the Jerusalem embassy in May to coincide with the 70th anniversary of Israel\u2019s independence by redesignating an existing consular facility.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe president said on Monday that he may attend. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at coming,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIf I can, I will.\u201d\n\nAs he has before, Mr. Trump argued that his decision to recognize Jerusalem resolved a tough issue dividing Israel and the Palestinians. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken it off the table,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this gives us a real opportunity for peace.\u201d\n\nHardly any veterans of Middle East peacemaking, including some who support moving the embassy, share this view. Mr. Trump\u2019s unilateral declaration does not mean that the Palestinians have given up on Jerusalem; instead, they have dug in. Many former negotiators have envisioned a peace deal in which both sides operate their capitals out of Jerusalem, the Israelis in the west and the Palestinians in the east.\n\nAs he often does, Mr. Trump boasted that he had already cut the cost of building a new embassy, but he seemed to be conflating two different expenses. \u201cThey put an order in front of my desk last week for a billion dollars,\u201d he said. \u201cI said a billion? What\u2019s that for? They said, \u2018We\u2019re going to build an embassy.\u2019 I said we\u2019re not going to spend a billion dollars. We\u2019re actually doing it for about $250,000.\u201d\n\nThe State Department has estimated that construction of a new embassy will cost about $500 million. Mr. Trump\u2019s reference to $250,000 presumably is the cost of making minor adjustments to the existing consular facility so that it can house an office for the American ambassador and be formally redesignated an embassy while a new facility is constructed.", "keywords": ["jerusalem", "long", "israel", "neutral", "guy", "gone", "netanyahu", "embassy", "palestinians", "mr", "trump", "state", "hopes", "peace", "trumps", "president", "mideast"], "polarity": 0.041305806321050215, "subjectivity": 0.35234113785943055},

In turn, insurers have shifted more of those costs onto consumers. Saddled with high deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs that expose them to a drug\u2019s rising list price, many people are paying thousands of dollars a month merely to survive.\n\nFor more than a year, President Trump and Democrats in Congress have promised to take action on high drug prices, but despite a flurry of proposals, little has changed.\n\nThese are the stories of Americans living daily with the reality of high-cost drugs. And there are millions of others just like them.\n\nSkipping drugs she can\u2019t afford\n\nVideo Skipping Drugs She Can't Afford\n\nSaundra Johnson, 57, Minneapolis\n\nWith an annual income of less than $20,000, Ms. Johnson doesn\u2019t come close to being able to afford the 12 medications her doctors have prescribed for congestive heart failure, diabetes and related complications.\n\nShe is one of the many who finds herself \u201cin between,\u201d as one of her doctors described it, narrowly missing the requirements for assistance but making too little to afford her prescriptions.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown of the math: Ms. Johnson\u2019s Social Security disability income of $19,560 in 2017 placed her above the cutoff for receiving additional government assistance for her prescriptions, called Extra Help, even though nearly every dollar of her income is already spoken for, from paying Medicare premiums to food and other household expenses.\n\nMedicare rules prohibit her from using drug co-pay coupons, which are commonly used by those with private insurance. And Novo Nordisk, the company that sells her fast-acting insulin, Novolog, and her diabetes medication, Victoza, requires low-income Medicare beneficiaries to first spend $1,000 on drugs in each calendar year before they can qualify for free drugs through its program. In a cruel twist, Ms. Johnson doesn\u2019t have that $1,000 to spend, so she resorts to not taking some drugs for months until she reaches the company\u2019s threshold.\n\nThese are tough choices. Sometimes she stops taking the short-acting Novolog, staying on the longer-acting insulin, Tresiba, as well as her heart medications, like bumetanide and digoxin. \u201cI prioritize the heart stuff over the insulin because the heart stuff is more immediate,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Johnson understands the risks; she was a health educator for people with H.I.V. and AIDS, helping patients enroll in programs that lowered their drug costs.\n\nHer blood sugar has risen dangerously high, and a little over a year ago, she was hospitalized for three weeks because she said she wasn\u2019t on the right diuretic to reduce excess fluid.\n\nLast June, she was approved for the Novo Nordisk assistance program, allowing her to begin taking the Novolog insulin again. As of mid-November, Ms. Johnson had spent $2,782 on prescription drugs, not counting the cost of the free insulin, according to a report provided by her pharmacy.\n\nFor another drug, Entresto, an expensive treatment for heart failure, Ms. Johnson participates in a clinical trial that provides the drug for free. Once that ends, she faces another hurdle: \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a discount or I\u2019m not going to be on Entresto anymore.\u201d\n\nIn January, she started all over again. \u201cI\u2019m stuck between a rock and a hard place, and I\u2019m sure a lot of other people are as well.\u201d\n\nTHE BACKGROUND:\n\nMedicare\u2019s prescription drug program, known as Part D, has been a lifeline for seniors and disabled people. Those with the lowest incomes can qualify for federally subsidized Extra Help to reduce their costs. But to be eligible, an individual must earn less than $18,210 and a married couple living together cannot earn more than $24,690.\n\nIn a statement, Novo Nordisk said it provided some forms of insulin at reduced costs to help patients who are struggling. \u201cThis patient is an exceptional example, reminding us that we need to continuously evaluate how we keep our support programs sustainable while covering as many of those in need as possible.\u201d\n\n\u2018We always seem to fall through the cracks\u2019\n\nImage Credit Narayan Mahon for The New York Times\n\nAbigail Bostwick, 37, of Tomahawk, Wis.\n\nMs. Bostwick was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2013. Insurance covered the first drug she took, Tecfidera, but required her to contribute $1,000 a month.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t cry when I was handed the diagnosis of M.S.,\u201d Ms. Bostwick said. But after learning how much prescriptions would cost, \u201cThat was when I felt truly helpless.\u201d\n\nMs. Bostwick, a former journalist, has coverage through her husband\u2019s employer because she can no longer work. They hit their $4,500 annual deductible in the very first month of every year because Gilenya, the drug she had been taking until last fall, carried a list price of about $5,500 a month. The couple put aside $375 every month to make sure they could cover that deductible.\n\nThe Bostwicks, who recently decided to divorce, have drained their savings, given up family vacations, and sold a motorcycle, a car, furniture and other belongings. Changes to her husband\u2019s employee benefits this year means another $1,000 out of pocket annually. Ms. Bostwick, who is disabled, said she plans to sign up for Medicare coverage after she loses access to her husband\u2019s insurance.\n\nMs. Bostwick suffered severe side effects that led her to stop taking Gilenya, and she\u2019s recently been approved to begin a new drug, Ocrevus.\n\n\u201cThis is such a huge bill and it\u2019s not really something that we can forgo,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re your basic middle-class couple. We don\u2019t have an extravagant lifestyle or anything like that. But we always seem to fall through the cracks.\u201d\n\nTHE BACKGROUND:\n\nThe prices of several multiple sclerosis drugs have shot up in recent years. The cost of Gilenya, the drug that Ms. Bostwick took, has nearly doubled to almost $92,000 a year since Novartis got approval for it in 2010.\n\nIn a statement, Novartis pointed to its patient assistance program that eliminates monthly out-of-pocket costs for most commercially insured patients (Ms. Bostwick said her family income is too high to qualify for most assistance programs).\n\nThere are also signs that companies may be getting the message. Ocrevus, the drug Ms. Bostwick will soon begin taking, was approved in 2017 and Genentech, its manufacturer, announced it would price the new drug at 25 percent below the list price of Rebif, the older drug that it beat in clinical trials.\n\nA shell game of debt\n\nImage Credit Andrew Burton for The New York Times\n\nMatthew Botts, 34, Oakland, Calif.\n\nIn 2007, Mr. Botts was 24 and three weeks into his first year at the University of San Francisco School of Law when he was diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia, a blood cancer. His doctor prescribed Gleevec, an effective but expensive medication that until recently cost more than $140,000 per year. The price recently began to go down in the face of generic competition.\n\nMr. Botts had no money to spare. For the first months of his treatment, he was able to take another patient\u2019s unused medications that were no longer needed (she was dying and his oncologist had connected them). Then, after receiving coverage through a former employer, Mr. Botts moved up his wedding date so he could switch to his wife\u2019s policy. But between his deductible and out-of-pocket costs, his expenses added up. Mr. Botts applied for assistance through a program run by Gleevec\u2019s maker, Novartis, but said he was rejected because his wife made slightly too much.\n\nWithout options, Mr. Botts tapped into his law school loans. \u201cAt 24, when you\u2019re really not making any money, you don\u2019t really have any options other than that,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Botts dropped out of law school. \u201cWhen everyone else is 24, 25 and going out and partying,\u201d he was worried about ensuring he had money \u201cso I could make sure I paid for my chemotherapy meds and still go to class.\u201d\n\nToday, he owes more than $73,000. He works at a debt collection company in the Bay Area, managing corporate relationships for banks. The irony is not lost on him. \u201cWe have a huge pile of medical debt that resulted from all of this. It just hasn\u2019t been paid,\u201d he said. \u201cI will be paying those up until the day I die.\u201d\n\nTHE BACKGROUND:\n\nThere\u2019s no dispute that Gleevec is a breakthrough cancer drug. It is also a very expensive one whose cost has increased sharply over the years. When it was launched in 2001, Gleevec cost $26,000 a year. That price increased significantly, to about $146,000 in 2016, before the drug lost its patent protection and began facing generic competition. The drug\u2019s price has been falling since then, though not as quickly as some hoped.\n\nIn a statement, Novartis, the maker of Gleevec, said it was not familiar with Mr. Botts\u2019 situation, but that it \u201coffers one of the most significant patient assistance programs (PAPs) in the industry.\u201d The company suggests that patients contact its assistance program, Patient Assistance Now Oncology.\n\nOverall, cancer drug prices are increasing at a rate much faster than inflation.\n\nStockpiling insulin\n\nImage Credit Andrea Morales for The New York Times\n\nAmanda Walker, 34, of Memphis, Tenn.\n\nDiabetes has driven nearly all of Ms. Walker\u2019s adult life.\n\nMs. Walker, who was diagnosed with diabetes at age 9, dropped out of college, forgoing her aspirations to be an artist, in part because she needed health insurance. She sought out retail jobs with coverage, selling suits at Men\u2019s Warehouse and Jos. A. Bank. She got an insulin pump, helping keep her stable. Even then, she struggled to pay her out-of-pocket costs, spending $300 a month for insulin and other supplies.\n\nLast fall, she became unemployed after taking a new job that didn\u2019t work out. Without coverage, Ms. Walker stockpiled empty vials of insulin in her refrigerator, using a syringe to suck out whatever drops were left. She once turned to Facebook, pleading for help, and within 45 minutes a nearby resident offered her two insulin pens.\n\nBy December, Ms. Walker obtained subsidized health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. She pays a premium of $3.95 a month and $25 a month for insulin.\n\nBut even though her health coverage is more secure, she still worries that she could wind up rationing her insulin again if the health care law were repealed.\n\n\u201cI think in an alternate universe, there\u2019s a me that\u2019s not diabetic,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I wonder what she\u2019s doing. What life is she living? I\u2019m stuck.\u201d\n\nTHE BACKGROUND:\n\nIn the United States, three manufacturers dominate the insulin market \u2014 Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi \u2014 and a recent study found that prices nearly tripled from 2002 to 2013.\n\nThe drug makers have been accused of price-fixing in several patient lawsuits, and several states are investigating.\n\nIn response, the companies have rolled out programs, such as one through CVS Health, that reduce costs for the uninsured or those with high-deductible coverage.\n\nDespite the uproar, all three manufacturers raised their list prices again in 2017, according to the Gold Standard Drug Database from Elsevier, an information analytics company.\n\nA common childhood ailment carries a big price tag\n\nImage Credit Melissa Lyttle for The New York Times\n\nAviva Williams, 42, Los Angeles\n\nLast year, Ms. Williams\u2019s four-year-old daughter, Amy, began complaining about an itchy bottom \u2014 a classic sign, her doctor later informed her, of pinworms. Ms. Williams gave Amy an over-the-counter medicine and her daughter\u2019s symptoms seemed to improve.\n\nWhen the pinworms returned a while later, the doctor prescribed albendazole, a prescription treatment that has been around for decades. Ms. Williams thought little of it, until she checked the price with her pharmacist. The drug cost $724 for a four-tablet treatment, and according to her drug plan, she had to pay about $250. Because her doctor recommended that all four family members be treated, she was suddenly facing a $1,000 bill.\n\nTo save money, Ms. Williams decided to fill prescriptions for her daughter and herself, but to buy the over-the-counter treatment for her husband and younger daughter, who did not have symptoms.\n\nVideo Treating a Common Children's Ailment Isn't Cheap\n\nA few weeks later, Ms. Williams found pinworms in her younger daughter\u2019s diaper, and had to pay $250 for another round of albendazole.\n\nShe said she is furious that she was forced to pay $750 for an old drug. \u201cThey price it because they can,\u201d said Ms. Williams said. \u201cWall Street decided they could make money off prescription drugs, which is just scary and depressing.\u201d\n\nTHE BACKGROUND:\n\nAlthough albendazole lost its patent protection years ago, just one company, Impax Laboratories, sells the drug. Its high price dates to 2010, when a company called Amedra Pharmaceuticals \u2014 later acquired by Impax \u2014 bought the right to sell it from GlaxoSmithKline, and raised the price to about $120 a pill from roughly $6.\n\nA spokesman for Impax Laboratories declined to say why Amedra raised the price.\n\nMs. Williams saved her bottle of albendazole as a bitter reminder of how she once had to pay hundreds of dollars for a handful of pills. The other day she noticed a detail she had not seen before: Impax does not even make the drug. It is still manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline.\n\nTwo battlefields: the illness and the bills\n\nImage Credit Eric Ginnard for The New York Times\n\nCarter Knutson, 68, Bloomington, Ill.\n\nAt the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., Mr. Knutson had begun a two-pronged treatment aimed at attacking a large tumor threatening his pulmonary artery. As chemotherapy dripped into his bloodstream, he learned that his insurance company wouldn\u2019t cover the second phase, a pill called Xeloda that he could take at home.\n\nDoctors at Mayo wrote to the Knutsons\u2019 prescription benefits manager, CVS Caremark, to explain that Mr. Knutson\u2019s kidney disease made him a bad candidate for the usual treatment, with the chemotherapy drug cisplatin.\n\nAfter a denial and failing two appeals, Mr. Knutson, a retired farm equipment salesman, and his wife Julie, decided to pay for the drug themselves. \u201cWe felt like we didn\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Mrs. Knutson said. After using a coupon they found online, the pill cost $1,000 per prescription. After three courses of the drug, Mr. Knutson\u2019s tumor shrank enough to enable surgery. He is now in remission.\n\nAfter the operation, the Knutsons appealed again \u2014 this time through the state\u2019s insurance commissioner. Within 24 hours, the reviewer ordered CVS to cover the pills.\n\nThe Knutsons received a check in July 2016 for $2,790.81; they turned around and donated $3,000 to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nThe fighting took its toll, Mr. Knutson said. \u201cWhen you are in that situation, you are really fragile, not as capable as you are when you are healthy in an everyday situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re trying to make it so difficult that you just give up.\u201d\n\nTHE BACKGROUND:\n\nMr. Knutson\u2019s situation is a good reminder that even if your insurer rejects a treatment or drug, you have the right to appeal \u2014 often more than once. He only won when he appealed to an outside reviewer through the Illinois insurance department, an external process required by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhile CVS Caremark said in a statement that it respected the care provided by the Mayo Clinic\u2019s oncologists, it added: \u201cThis case illustrates that medical experts can disagree on whether experimental therapy may work for a patient, and we certainly hope it has for Mr. Knutson.\u201d\n\nA father crosses the border for his son\n\nVideo Crossing the Border for His Son's Prescription\n\nJonathan Yeagley, 61, Berwyn, Pa.\n\nEvery three months, Mr. Yeagley, a stock trader, hops into his car and drives seven hours \u2014 390 miles \u2014 from his home outside Philadelphia to a Walmart half a mile across the Canadian border. There, he buys Xeljanz to treat his son Jonathan\u2019s alopecia areata, a type of hair loss caused by an immune disorder. He drives back the same day.\n\nIn 2016, Independence Blue Cross, Mr. Yeagley\u2019s insurer at the time, rejected coverage of the drug because Xeljanz is approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis, not alopecia. Mr. Yeagley appealed and lost his case; an outside reviewer wrote that there\u2019s not enough evidence that the drug is effective against alopecia. In 2017, Mr. Yeagley switched to another insurer that does not cover prescription drugs.\n\nThere are no approved drug treatments for the condition, and Mr. Yeagley\u2019s son\u2019s doctor at Yale University, Brett King, has found Xeljanz effective at regrowing hair for some patients. (Dr. King is a consultant for the drug\u2019s maker, Pfizer.) Once a year, Mr. Yeagley uses a coupon from Pfizer that covers about three months of the drug, but for the rest of the year he is on his own.\n\nIn the United States, Xeljanz costs about $50,000 a year (through a drug discount website). That\u2019s after Pfizer raised the price of Xeljanz by nearly 8 percent in January. In Canada, the price tag is $15,000.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have that kind of money to throw away,\u201d said Mr. Yeagley, who has made five trips so far. Mr. Yeagley\u2019s son spoke on FaceTime with a Canadian doctor who asked for pictures and reviewed laboratory results before writing a prescription so the Yeagleys could legally obtain the drug in Canada.\n\nJonathan, who is 20, worries about shouldering the costs in the future. \u201cI don\u2019t tell him that I think about it a lot but I do think about it a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful for what he does for me but I don\u2019t know how long it can go on.\u201d\n\nTHE BACKGROUND:\n\nDrug prices are cheaper in Canada, where an independent quasi-judicial body is supposed to ensure that pharmaceutical companies do not charge excessive prices.\n\nIn another twist, the price of Xeljanz has come under scrutiny because it was developed in part based on research by the National Institutes of Health, a federal agency. Some consumer groups and lawmakers have questioned whether drugs developed with taxpayer money should carry lower price tags.\n\nIn a statement, Pfizer said it is studying medications to treat alopecia. It has said it spent more than a $1 billion on \u201cthe discovery, development and commercialization of Xeljanz.\u201d", "keywords": ["price", "costs", "pay", "mr", "treatment", "assistance", "ms", "insulin", "drugs", "drug", "bostwick"], "polarity": 0.06421070973255438, "subjectivity": 0.3812693509295451},

Mr. Madison shot Ms. Greene, too, wounding her.\n\nMr. Madison remembers none of this. He has suffered at least two severe strokes, and he is blind and incontinent. His speech is slurred, and what he says does not always make sense.\n\nHe has asked that his mother be told of his strokes, but his mother is dead. He soils himself, saying \u201cno one will let me out to use the bathroom,\u201d though there is a toilet in his cell. He says he plans to move to Florida. He can recite the alphabet, but only to the letter G.\n\nMr. Madison also insists that he \u201cnever went around killing folks.\u201d\n\nA court-appointed psychologist found that Mr. Madison had \u201csignificant body and cognitive decline as a result of strokes.\u201d But the psychologist testified that Mr. Madison understood what he was accused of and how the state planned to punish him.

His second conviction was thrown out after prosecutors committed misconduct by using expert testimony to tell the jury about evidence never properly introduced.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt Mr. Madison\u2019s third trial, the jury voted to sentence him to life in prison. But Judge Ferrill D. McRae, of Mobile County Circuit Court, overrode that verdict and sentenced Mr. Madison to death.\n\nI interviewed Judge McRae in 2011, not long before he died. I had sought him out because he had achieved a rare distinction. He had overridden six jury verdicts calling for life sentences, a state record, while never rejecting a jury\u2019s recommendation of death.\n\nAlabama juries are not notably squeamish about the death penalty, but Judge McRae said they needed to be corrected when they were seized by an impulse toward mercy. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t have something like that,\u201d he said of judicial overrides, \u201ca jury with no experience in other cases would be making the ultimate decision, based on nothing.\u201d\n\nAlabama abolished judicial overrides last year.\n\nIn 2016, Mr. Madison came very close to being put to death. A deadlocked eight-member Supreme Court refused to vacate a stay of execution issued by a federal appeals court, with the court\u2019s four conservative members saying they would have let the execution proceed. Justice Antonin Scalia had died a few months before, leaving the Supreme Court short-handed. Had Justice Scalia lived, Mr. Madison would almost certainly be dead by now.\n\nThe case took some additional procedural twists, and Mr. Madison returned to the Supreme Court in January after a state court again ruled against him. The Supreme Court stayed his execution, though the court\u2019s three most conservative members \u2014 Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch \u2014 said they would have let it go forward.\n\nThe case, Madison v. Alabama, No. 17-7505, will be argued in the fall, and it will give the court a chance to consider some profound questions.\n\n\u201cMr. Madison is one among a growing number of aging prisoners who remain on death row in this country for ever longer periods of time,\u201d Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote in a concurring opinion when the court considered an earlier appeal. \u201cGiven this trend, we may face ever more instances of state efforts to execute prisoners suffering the diseases and infirmities of old age.\u201d", "keywords": ["strokes", "row", "aging", "considers", "madison", "execution", "case", "death", "executed", "mr", "jury", "supreme", "mcrae", "state", "old", "court"], "polarity": 0.055318131480922184, "subjectivity": 0.4242147387496225},

I tried it on myself. What could go wrong?\n\nThe scene opened on a room with a red sofa, a potted plant and the kind of bland modern art you\u2019d see on a therapist\u2019s wall.\n\nIn the room was Michelle Obama, or someone who looked exactly like her. Wearing a low-cut top with a black bra visible underneath, she writhed lustily for the camera and flashed her unmistakable smile.\n\nThen, the former first lady\u2019s doppelg\u00e4nger began to strip.\n\nThe video, which appeared on the online forum Reddit, was what\u2019s known as a \u201cdeepfake\u201d \u2014 an ultrarealistic fake video made with artificial intelligence software. It was created using a program called FakeApp, which superimposed Mrs. Obama\u2019s face onto the body of a pornographic film actress. The hybrid was uncanny \u2014 if you didn\u2019t know better, you might have thought it was really her.\n\nUntil recently, realistic computer-generated video was a laborious pursuit available only to big-budget Hollywood productions or cutting-edge researchers. Social media apps like Snapchat include some rudimentary face-morphing technology.\n\nBut in recent months, a community of hobbyists has begun experimenting with more powerful tools, including FakeApp \u2014 a program that was built by an anonymous developer using open-source software written by Google. FakeApp makes it free and relatively easy to create realistic face swaps and leave few traces of manipulation. Since a version of the app appeared on Reddit in January, it has been downloaded more than 120,000 times, according to its creator.\n\nDeepfakes are one of the newest forms of digital media manipulation, and one of the most obviously mischief-prone. It\u2019s not hard to imagine this technology\u2019s being used to smear politicians, create counterfeit revenge porn or frame people for crimes. Lawmakers have already begun to worry about how deepfakes could be used for political sabotage and propaganda.\n\nEven on morally lax sites like Reddit, deepfakes have raised eyebrows. Recently, FakeApp set off a panic after Motherboard, the technology site, reported that people were using it to create pornographic deepfakes of celebrities. Pornhub, Twitter and other sites quickly banned the videos, and Reddit closed a handful of deepfake groups, including one with nearly 100,000 members.\n\nBefore the Reddit deepfake groups were closed, they hosted a mixture of users trading video-editing tips and showing off their latest forgeries. A post titled \u201c3D face reconstruction for additional angles\u201d sat next to videos with titles like \u201c(Not) Olivia Wilde playing with herself.\u201d\n\nSome users on Reddit defended deepfakes and blamed the media for overhyping their potential for harm. Others moved their videos to alternative platforms, rightly anticipating that Reddit would crack down under its rules against nonconsensual pornography. And a few expressed moral qualms about putting the technology into the world.\n\nThen, they kept making more.\n\nThe deepfake creator community is now in the internet\u2019s shadows. But while out in the open, it gave an unsettling peek into the future.\n\n\u201cThis is turning into an episode of Black Mirror,\u201d wrote one Reddit user. The post raised the ontological questions at the heart of the deepfake debate: Does a naked image of Person A become a naked image of Person B if Person B\u2019s face is superimposed in a seamless and untraceable way? In a broader sense, on the internet, what is the difference between representation and reality?\n\nThe user then signed off with a shrug: \u201cGodspeed rebels.\u201d\n\nMaking Deepfakes\n\nAfter lurking for several weeks in Reddit\u2019s deepfake community, I decided to see how easy it was to create a (safe for work, nonpornographic) deepfake using my own face.\n\nI started by downloading FakeApp and enlisting two technical experts to help me. The first was Mark McKeague, a colleague in The New York Times\u2019s research and development department. The second was a deepfake creator I found through Reddit, who goes by the nickname Derpfakes.\n\nBecause of the controversial nature of deepfakes, Derpfakes would not give his or her real name. Derpfakes started posting deepfake videos on YouTube a few weeks ago, specializing in humorous offerings like Nicolas Cage playing Superman. The account has also posted some how-to videos on deepfake creation.\n\nWhat I learned is that making a deepfake isn\u2019t simple. But it\u2019s not rocket science, either.\n\nThe first step is to find, or rent, a moderately powerful computer. FakeApp uses a suite of machine learning tools called TensorFlow, which was developed by Google\u2019s A.I. division and released to the public in 2015. The software teaches itself to perform image-recognition tasks through trial and error. The more processing power on hand, the faster it works.\n\nTo get more speed, Mark and I used a remote server rented through Google Cloud Platform. It provided enough processing power to cut the time frame down to hours, rather than the days or weeks it might take on my laptop.\n\nOnce Mark set up the remote server and loaded FakeApp on it, we were on to the next step: data collection.\n\nPicking the right source data is crucial. Short video clips are easier to manipulate than long clips, and scenes shot at a single angle produce better results than scenes with multiple angles. Genetics also help. The more the faces resemble each other, the better.\n\nI\u2019m a brown-haired white man with a short beard, so Mark and I decided to try several other brown-haired, stubbled white guys. We started with Ryan Gosling. (Aim high, right?) I also sent Derpfakes, my outsourced Reddit expert, several video options to choose from.\n\nNext, we took several hundred photos of my face, and gathered images of Mr. Gosling\u2019s face using a clip from a recent TV appearance. FakeApp uses these images to train the deep learning model and teach it to emulate our facial expressions.\n\nTo get the broadest photo set possible, I twisted my head at different angles, making as many different faces as I could.\n\nMark then used a program to crop those images down, isolating just our faces, and manually deleted any blurred or badly cropped photos. He then fed the frames into FakeApp. In all, we used 417 photos of me, and 1,113 of Mr. Gosling.\n\nWhen the images were ready, Mark pressed \u201cstart\u201d on FakeApp, and the training began. His computer screen filled with images of my face and Mr. Gosling\u2019s face, as the program tried to identify patterns and similariti es.\n\nAbout eight hours later, after our model had been sufficiently trained, Mark used FakeApp to finish putting my face on Mr. Gosling\u2019s body. The video was blurry and bizarre, and Mr. Gosling\u2019s face occasionally flickered into view. Only the legally blind would mistake the person in the video for me.\n\nWe did better with a clip of Chris Pratt, the scruffy star of \u201cJurassic World,\u201d whose face shape is a little more similar to mine. For this test, Mark used a bigger data set \u2014 1,861 photos of me, 1,023 of him \u2014 and let the model run overnight.\n\nA few days later, Derpfakes, who had also been training a model, sent me a finished deepfake made using the footage I had sent and a video of the actor Jake Gyllenhaal. This one was much more lifelike, a true hybrid that mixed my facial features with his hair, beard and body.\n\nDerpfakes repeated the process with videos of Jimmy Kimmel and Liev Schreiber, both of which turned out well. As an experienced deepfake creator, Derpfakes had a more intuitive sense of which source videos would produce a clean result, and more experience with the subtle blending and tweaking that takes place at the end of the deepfake process.\n\nIn all, our deepfake experiment took three days and cost $85.96 in Google Cloud Platform credits. That seemed like a small price to pay for stardom.\n\nWhat the App\u2019s Creator Says\n\nAfter the experiment, I reached out to the anonymous creator of FakeApp through an email address on its website. I wanted to know how it felt to create a cutting-edge A.I. tool, only to have it gleefully co-opted by ethically challenged pornographers.\n\nA man wrote back, identifying himself as a software developer in Maryland. Like Derpfakes, the man would not give me his full name, and instead went by his first initial, N. He said he had created FakeApp as a creative experiment and was chagrined to see Reddit\u2019s deepfake community use it for ill.\n\n\u201cI joined the community based around these algorithms when it was very small (less than 500 people),\u201d he wrote, \u201cand as soon as I saw the results I knew this was brilliant tech that should be accessible to anyone who wants to play around with it. I figured I\u2019d take a shot at putting together an easy-to-use package to accomplish that.\u201d\n\nN. said he didn\u2019t support the use of FakeApp to create nonconsensual pornography or other abusive content. And he said he agreed with Reddit\u2019s decision to ban explicit deepfakes. But he defended the product.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve given it a lot of thought,\u201d he said, \u201cand ultimately I\u2019ve decided I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to condemn the technology itself \u2014 which can of course be used for many purposes, good and bad.\u201d\n\nFakeApp is somewhat finicky and hard to use, but it\u2019s easy to imagine it improving quickly. N. said that in the future, FakeApp could be used by all kinds of people to bring high-budget special effects to their personal projects.\n\nDeep learning algorithms, he added, were going to be important in the future, not only as stand-alone apps but as powerful components of many tech products.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s precisely the things that make them so powerful and useful that make them so scary,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s really no limit to what you can apply it to with a little imagination.\u201d\n\n\u2018Next Form of Communication\u2019\n\nOn the day of the school shooting last month in Parkland, Fla., a screenshot of a BuzzFeed News article, \u201cWhy We Need to Take Away White People\u2019s Guns Now More Than Ever,\u201d written by a reporter named Richie Horowitz, began making the rounds on social media.\n\nThe whole thing was fake. No BuzzFeed employee named Richie Horowitz exists, and no article with that title was ever published on the site. But the doctored image pulsed through right-wing outrage channels and was boosted by activists on Twitter. It wasn\u2019t an A.I.-generated deepfake, or even a particularly sophisticated Photoshop job, but it did the trick.\n\nOnline misinformation, no matter how sleekly produced, spreads through a familiar process once it enters our social distribution channels. The hoax gets 50,000 shares, and the debunking an hour later gets 200. The carnival barker gets an algorithmic boost on services like Facebook and YouTube, while the expert screams into the void.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason to believe that deepfake videos will operate any differently. People will share them when they\u2019re ideologically convenient and dismiss them when they\u2019re not. The dupes who fall for satirical stories from The Onion will be fooled by deepfakes, and the scrupulous people who care about the truth will find ways to detect and debunk them.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no choice,\u201d said Hao Li, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Southern California. Mr. Li, who is also the founder of Pinscreen, a company that uses artificial intelligence to create lifelike 3-D avatars, said the weaponization of A.I. was inevitable and would require a sudden shift in public awareness.\n\n\u201cI see this as the next form of communication,\u201d he said. \u201cI worry that people will use it to blackmail others, or do bad things. You have to educate people that this is possible.\u201d\n\nSo, O.K. Here I am, telling you this: An A.I. program powerful enough to turn Michelle Obama into a pornography star, or transform a schlubby newspaper columnist into Jake Gyllenhaal, is in our midst. Manipulated video will soon become far more commonplace.\n\nAnd there\u2019s probably nothing we can do except try to bat the fakes down as they happen, pressure social media companies to fight misinformation aggressively, and trust our eyes a little less every day.\n\nGodspeed, rebels.\n\nKevin Roose is a columnist for Business Day and a writer-at-large for The New York Times Magazine.

Some top White House staff were unaware the president was going to roll out these tariffs until he did so on national television.\n\nMr. Navarro and Mr. Ross have been among the staunchest defenders of the trade action, which would hit global trading partners like Canada and South Korea much more than China, which the administration has described as the primary culprit in putting American metal makers out of business. Both men backed the tariffs, saying the benefits to American metal makers would be considerable and the costs to industries that use those metals in their products \u2014 like automakers and food packagers \u2014 negligible.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Ross described the effect of the tariff as \u201ca fraction of a penny on a can of beer.\u201d Mr. Navarro clashed with Chris Wallace of Fox News, who tried to get the economic adviser to admit that those costs, when multiplied by all products that use steel and aluminum over the entire economy, would escalate into the billions of dollars. Mr. Navarro said he saw the costs as \u201cinsignificant\u201d in the mission to preserve the steel and aluminum industries, which have seen factories pick up and move from the United States to cheaper parts of the world.\n\nThe White House\u2019s plan continued to face fierce criticism, including from Republicans who believe free trade is in the interest of the economy.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, criticized the tariffs for falling more heavily on American allies than on China, which he said had earlier flooded the global market with steel.\n\nEconomists say the tariffs, if applied without exceptions, would harm allies like Canada, South Korea and the European Union, which export more steel to the United States than China does. Shortly after the tariffs were announced, the European Union responded by saying that it was already preparing to levy retaliatory tariffs on American products, including orange juice, bluejeans and Harley-Davidson motorcycles.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re letting China off the hook,\u201d Mr. Graham said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cChina wins when we fight with Europe.\u201d\n\nJoshua B. Bolten, the head of the Business Roundtable and chief of staff in the George W.

In those early months, in an act born of savvy or necessity, Ms. Conway stepped back from the media glare to focus on demonstrating to her colleagues and her critics that she was as capable on policy as she was sparring with talking heads on TV.\n\nHer choice seems to have paid off.\n\n\u201cShe has this unique position that she\u2019s earned,\u201d said former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who worked closely on the opioid crisis with Ms. Conway and credited her with urging the president to personalize the issue through his brother\u2019s experience with addiction. \u201cShe\u2019s gotten a bad rap at times, but I think that\u2019s because of some of the really awful people inside the White House who have been trying to hurt her, as opposed to anything the press came up with on its own.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, Ms. Conway has watched, somewhat from the sidelines, as John F. Kelly, the president\u2019s current chief of staff, came in and pledged to bring order to the West Wing, dispatching a number of aides who had once envied the access Ms. Conway cultivated with the president.\n\n\u201cHe came around and wanted to know what everyone had been working on for the first six months,\u201d Ms. Conway said, \u201cand some of us were just better equipped to handle that question than others.\u201d\n\nFor the president, Ms. Conway, an outspoken opponent of abortion, is one of his most prominent ties to the conservative movement.\n\nRepresentative Mark Meadows, the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said Ms. Conway had been wise to engage in public appearances only \u201cat times when the president has asked her to engage.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about Kellyanne,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the president of the United States and this country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Meadows added: \u201cThe limelight is not the primary concern for getting her agenda done, and I think that has served her well.\u201d\n\nShe has told allies in and outside the West Wing that her respect is not just for the president, but the presidency as an institution. Still, one of her biggest strengths, those who know her say, is that she has always understood whom she works for. Loyalty to her clients always came easily, but this time, her client just happens to be in the Oval Office.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A friend of Ms. Conway\u2019s, who didn\u2019t want to be identified because of the social opprobrium she would face as a Democrat, said Ms. Conway had particularly struggled with Reince Priebus, the president\u2019s former chief of staff, during the first chaotic months of the administration. She also survived efforts to curtail her influence by Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, who for months privately bristled over Ms. Conway\u2019s getting credit for the campaign victory.\n\nBut, that friend said, she learned that if her colleagues did not take her seriously, she could use it to her advantage. She kept her head down while other aides burned out, and kept her access to the president.\n\nIn fact, her portfolio has grown, with the addition of the opioid crisis and coordination with cabinet secretaries, which originally fell under Mr. Kushner\u2019s purview. On Thursday, she put together an opioid summit meeting with cabinet members at the White House, which the president briefly joined.\n\nOther Republicans say her loyalty to Mr. Trump \u2014 and thus her ability to survive in his chaotic White House \u2014 is no virtue.\n\n\u201cShe has no shame,\u201d Tim Miller, a former spokesman for Jeb Bush\u2019s presidential campaign, said in a text message, \u201cand that is a quality the president values.\u201d\n\nMs. Conway, of course, would see it differently. She refers to those who have lasted from the campaign until now as \u201cunbroken threads.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe was not originally part of the campaign, but her friends say she has known the president for more than a decade, and has come to understand him and how to speak with him in ways few aides do outside of Ms. Hicks and Keith Schiller, Mr. Trump\u2019s longtime bodyguard, who left the White House last year. For a president hit by crosscurrents on policy, Ms. Conway has frequently been a voice reminding him of his campaign promises.\n\nShe has called supporters from the final days of the Trump campaign members of the \u201cOctober 8th coalition,\u201d for defending Mr. Trump after audio of him bragging about sexual assault had leaked.\n\nA mother of four who moved her family to Washington last year, Ms. Conway has faced near-constant attack for defending Mr. Trump\u2019s track record with women. But she has also willingly stepped into battle, including when she criticized women for joining the Women\u2019s March the day after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration last year.\n\n\u201cI frankly didn\u2019t see the point,\u201d Ms. Conway said at the time.\n\nBut she and her allies say the attacks against her often have a sexist undertone. And she has bristled at a line of thought in liberal spheres and on social media that she and other women have advanced in the White House by keeping their heads down in a misogynistic workplace.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is more kind, open, gracious and respectful to the women in the White House than the so-called pro-women movement that criticizes everything from what we wear to what we say to what we believe,\u201d Ms. Conway said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t work there if he weren\u2019t open to my opinion.

But that money was largely obligated during the Obama administration, and the Trump administration has proposed slashing that assistance by more than half for the coming year, to $527 million, and to $491 million for the next year.\n\nWhile it waits for the funding transfer from the Pentagon, the center, which has a staff of around 60 people, including 23 contract analysts, will continue working on its original mission: countering jihadist and extremist propaganda.\n\nMost of the center\u2019s leaders are working in temporary assignments, a product of Mr. Tillerson\u2019s halt in promotions. The analysts work in a warren of cubicles in the basement of a tired building that once housed the Office of Strategic Services, the World War II predecessor to the C.I.A.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe analysts are divided into five teams that largely work in four languages: Arabic, Urdu, French and Somali. The analysts said in interviews that they had notched some significant victories, including a video montage proving that the Islamic State had itself destroyed Al Nuri Grand Mosque in Mosul, Iraq, and a widely seen cartoon in French depicting the miserable life of an Islamic State fighter.\n\nStill, these efforts are a small fraction of what Congress envisioned. A 2015 internal assessment found that the Islamic State had been far more nimble on social media than the United States had been. In May, Congress more than doubled the center\u2019s budget, providing an additional $19 million over its earlier budget of $14 million. But by Jan. 1, the department had spent just $3.6 million of the additional $19 million, Mr. Goldstein said.\n\nJames K. Glassman, the under secretary for public diplomacy during the George W.

In Texas, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee opened fire on a progressive candidate, Laura Moser, posting negative research to blunt her rise in fear that a victory by her in Tuesday\u2019s primary race could doom the party\u2019s bid for a suburban Houston district in November.\n\nBut the battle to define the party is playing out most vividly in overwhelmingly safe House districts around cities like Boston, Chicago and New York, where younger liberals, often women, people of color or both, are confronting men who are products of a clubhouse politics where fealty to the organization was paramount.\n\nAnd no lawmakers may be more vulnerable to the rising left than Mr. Lipinski and, in Massachusetts, Representative Michael E. Capuano, a far more liberal Democrat who is nevertheless confronting a restless electorate in his Boston-based district.\n\nMr. Lipinski, opposed to abortion and uneasy with gay rights, is locked in a bitter campaign with Ms. Newman, a former marketing consultant who has backing from powerful liberal groups like Naral Pro-Choice America and the Human Rights Campaign.\n\nMr. Capuano, who is serving his 20th year in Congress, is a down-the-line progressive, who has drawn no opposition so far from national liberal groups. But he has stirred a challenge from Ayanna Pressley, the first black woman elected to the Boston City Council. In a district once held by John F. Kennedy and Tip O\u2019Neill, where college campuses abound and minority communities now make up most of the population, Ms. Pressley argues that voters should demand an activist lawmaker who is more than a \u201creliable vote.\u201d\n\nMr. Lipinski was bequeathed his heavily Polish and Irish district in Chicago around Midway Airport and the South Side by his father, William Lipinski, a former ward boss and representative. The two Lipinskis have held the so-called Bungalow Belt seat for 35 unbroken years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut as in Mr. Capuano\u2019s district, where there is now more nostalgia for Mr. Obama than Camelot, this stretch of Chicagoland is rapidly changing.\n\nGentrifying precincts around what was Comiskey Park in the Bridgeport neighborhood are now filled with Wi-Fi-hungry hipsters. The elder Lipinski\u2019s old ward headquarters now sit next to a Puerto Rican restaurant, a reminder that over 30 percent of the district is Hispanic.\n\nYet there are still elements of the fish-fry-Friday voters, the Catholic demographic that political veterans here still call \u201cwhite ethnics.\u201d\n\nWearing a Notre Dame hat and standing apart from the attendees at the candidate forum was Jack Nevin, an Illinois Department of Transportation employee who as a child attended the same parish as the Lipinski family and now lives in suburban Lemont.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a pro-life guy, born and raised Catholic,\u201d said Mr. Nevin, by way of explaining why he was backing the incumbent. \u201cWin or lose, he\u2019s standing up for his beliefs.\u201d\n\nMs. Newman used the forum to lash Mr. Lipinski for being out of step with the district, a drumbeat that prompted him to claim she was fomenting \u201ca tea party of the left\u201d that was pushing liberal \u201cfantasies.\u201d\n\nBut it is Mr. Lipinski who is testing just how much today\u2019s voters in the Democratic primary contest are willing to accept in a safe seat. In addition to his deviation from orthodoxy on abortion and gay rights, he also opposed the Affordable Care Act and until recently did not support a $15 minimum wage or offering legal status to children brought to the country illegally.\n\n\u201cI am running with the district. I\u2019m not voting against the district,\u201d Ms. Newman said.\n\nHer energetic campaign has drawn the support of a host of Washington-based progressive groups, some of which are funding attack ads and mailers against Mr. Lipinski. And she has lured Representatives Luis V. Guti\u00e9rrez and Jan Schakowsky of Illinois to oppose their colleague, a rebuke that has angered some moderate Democrats.\n\nPhoto\n\nRepresentative Kurt Schrader of Oregon, who leads the political arm of the centrist Blue Dog caucus, has complained to the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee about the intervention of Ms. Schakowsky and said he would seek a rule change so that members like her who have formal positions on the committee cannot oppose incumbents. \u201cThat\u2019s just wrong, and we\u2019re going to change that,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the Washington contretemps are just a stand-in for a much weightier debate about the future of the party.\n\nMr. Lipinski, who makes no apology for opposing the health law, has embraced donations from anti-abortion Republicans helping fund a \u201csuper PAC\u201d in his favor and says it is Ms. Newman\u2019s ardent support for abortion rights that is \u201cextreme\u201d for the district.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

When she stopped recently to rally phone-bankers, one volunteer wore a T-shirt demanding \u201cReparations Now,\u201d a reference to the movement by African-Americans to retrieve compensation for slavery.\n\nSpeaking to her supporters, Ms. Newman invoked her transgender daughter.\n\nOver a diner lunch, where her Mercedes stuck out in the parking lot, she said a victory over Mr. Lipinski this month would echo across the country.\n\n\u201cWe need to have more diversity across people of color, gender and types of folks,\u201d Ms. Newman said. \u201cWe can\u2019t have all millionaires, billionaires, businesspeople and doctors in Congress.\u201d\n\nUnions are divided: Ms. Newman has the support of the more diverse service workers and teachers while Mr. Lipinski retains the backing of the building trades.\n\nA similar gulf exists in Mr. Capuano\u2019s district.\n\nThough the primary race is not until September, Ms. Pressley\u2019s candidacy has already roiled the party in Massachusetts, a rigidly hierarchical and predominantly white organization that is closely intertwined with organized labor.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn an unusual show of deference to Ms. Pressley, two of the state\u2019s highest-profile Democrats, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Seth Moulton, said they would stay neutral rather than back their colleague in Congress. Setti Warren, a former mayor of Newton who is the leading Democratic candidate for governor, endorsed Ms. Pressley. Damali Vidot, a Pressley supporter who is the president of the City Council in Chelsea, said there had been private pressure on Democrats not to buck Mr. Capuano.\n\nBut Ms. Vidot said with a smile that she was undeterred. \u201cI\u2019m with the new energy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need someone that understands the struggles of families in different neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nMr. Capuano is expected to mobilize a powerful group of supporters on his side. He counts Boston\u2019s popular mayor, Martin J. Walsh, as an ally, and Mr. Walsh has signaled he will back Mr. Capuano with his political operation, according to three people briefed on his plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because Mr. Walsh has not yet issued an endorsement. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III, perhaps the state\u2019s best-known House Democrat, is behind Mr. Capuano.\n\nMr. Capuano, 66, is one of three Democratic members of Congress facing primary opponents in Massachusetts, and he appears to be the most endangered. In an interview, Mr. Capuano acknowledged that he faced a new kind of race in a \u201csignificantly different\u201d political environment, and said he was prepared to defend a record of assailing Mr. Trump that includes two votes in favor of impeachment.\n\n\u201cMy district is upset,\u201d Mr. Capuano said. \u201cThey don\u2019t like the Donald Trump agenda, and I\u2019ve been as vocal as I can be.\u201d\n\nMs. Pressley, 44, has moved aggressively to cast Mr. Capuano as a figure of the past. At an event shortly after she announced she would run, she delivered a thematic broadside against Mr. Capuano without ever mentioning his name, depicting him as a well-meaning but too-conventional politician.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t play small ball and hang our hats on good votes on bad bills that pass,\u201d Ms. Pressley declared, to cheers from a crowd of more than 200 in a purple-lit barroom.\n\nMs. Pressley said the district had \u201cchanged a great deal\u201d over the last two decades. \u201cThe only thing that hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d she jabbed, \u201cis its representation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven in some traditionally Capuano-friendly quarters, there is a recognition that Ms. Pressley represents a kind of challenge the congressman has not faced before. Harris Gruman, the executive director of the Service Employees International Union\u2019s state council in Massachusetts, praised Mr. Capuano as a \u201cvery active\u201d ally, but he noted his union\u2019s membership was \u201cpredominantly people of color and women\u201d and said its endorsement would probably be up for grabs.\n\n\u201cWe are in a special moment, too, historically, with Trump as president and a sense of racial and social injustice at a heightened level,\u201d he said.\n\nBack on the South Side of Chicago, Ms. Newman fit right in as she spoke to voters at the Jackalope Coffee and Tea House, a few blocks from the old bungalow of former Mayor Richard J. Daley.\n\nMr. Daley, the iron-fisted personification of 20th-century machine politics, would have found the array of MacBooks, ironic mustaches and turmeric ginger-pumpkin chais as fantastical as the mythical animal from which the cafe takes its name.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s certainly an old guard, but there\u2019s also a rising number of young people in the city and young people here,\u201d said John Briggs, 47, a history professor, who liked what he heard from Ms. Newman. \u201cThere\u2019s an alienation from the machine.\u201d", "keywords": ["weigh", "pressley", "democratic", "democrat", "means", "capuano", "mr", "trump", "lipinski", "voters", "ms", "newman", "rights", "primaries", "begin", "divided", "district"], "polarity": 0.12148555871212122, "subjectivity": 0.40050493777056273},

People younger than 50 will be expected to work, or to train or search for jobs; attend school full time or volunteer \u2014 80 hours a month. Kentucky and Indiana are imposing the requirement on people younger than 65 and 60, respectively. But Arkansas\u2019s plan has harsher consequences for not meeting the requirement: those who do not comply for three months out of a year will be locked out of coverage until the following year.\n\n\u201cThis is not about punishing anyone,\u201d Mr. Hutchinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s about giving people an opportunity to work. It\u2019s about giving them the training they need. It\u2019s about helping them move out of poverty and up the economic ladder.\u201d\n\nSo far, only one other state, Massachusetts, has joined Arkansas in seeking permission to roll back its Medicaid expansion, and make the program available only to people with incomes below the federal poverty level: $12,060 for a single person, or about twice that amount for a family of four. Under the terms of the Affordable Care Act, states that chose to expand Medicaid had to provide it to everyone with incomes up to 138 percent of that level: $16,642 for a single person.\n\nBut if the Trump administration allows Arkansas to scale back its Medicaid expansion population, some of the other 31 states that expanded the program will likely want to follow, as a way to save money and appease conservative legislators who think the Obamacare expansion went too far. Other states may be tempted to expand Medicaid, after holding back for years, if they can limit it to those earning at or below the poverty level. The federal government initially paid the full cost of the expansion, but now states are on the hook for 6 percent of the cost; their share will gradually grow to 10 percent over the next few years.\n\nThe Arkansas proposal would move about 60,000 people out of the program, by lowering the income threshold to the federal poverty level.\n\nMr. Hutchinson wants those earning between 100 and 138 percent of the poverty level to move to the Affordable Care Act marketplace, where they would get federal subsidies to buy private insurance. But that could end up costing the federal government more money \u2014 another reason the Trump administration may be slow to approve it. President Trump frequently refers to the marketplaces as \u201cfailing\u201d and has taken a number of steps to weaken them.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The state uses federal Medicaid funds to buy private insurance for the poor \u2014 an alternative that conservative Republicans found acceptable when it was first passed in 2013. About 285,000 people are now enrolled in the Medicaid expansion.\n\nCindy Gillespie, the director of the Arkansas Department of Human Services, said the state was planning to activate an online portal on March 30 where those subject to the requirement will be expected to record how they\u2019re meeting it each month. In June, the state will start phasing it in, relying largely on its Department of Workforce services to connect job seekers with employment, education or training.\n\nKentucky, for its part, is sending out the first notices about its work requirement this week and plans to start rolling it out in July. Indiana will not roll out its work requirement until next year.\n\nLike Kentucky and Indiana, Arkansas will exempt people who qualify as \u201cmedically frail\u201d from the work requirement, as well as those who are pregnant, in treatment for substance abuse, in school full time or caring for children or someone incapacitated. Nor will those who qualified for Medicaid before the Obamacare expansion \u2014 children and disabled or elderly adults \u2014 be subject to it.\n\nOnly people from the ages of 30 through 49 will be subject to the requirement this year, and state officials have estimated that about 60 percent of them \u2014 59,714 out of 98,632 \u2014 either work already or will qualify for exemptions.\n\nYounger enrollees, down to the age of 19, will be subject to the work requirement starting next year.\n\nThe National Health Law Program, a nonprofit advocacy group that has already sued to stop Kentucky\u2019s work requirement, said Monday that Arkansas\u2019s also \u201cappears well outside the bounds of the limited authority\u201d that the Department of Health and Human Services has to change Medicaid provisions.\n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s work requirement program, beyond being legally suspect, will disproportionately harm the most underserved populations,\u201d said Jane Perkins, the program\u2019s legal director.", "keywords": ["expansion", "decision", "services", "delays", "trump", "work", "requirement", "states", "federal", "state", "administration", "program", "arkansas", "medicaid", "scaling"], "polarity": 0.06289888030394358, "subjectivity": 0.3546281074762087},

By waiting until Monday to reveal his intention to step down, Mr. Cochran effectively forced Mr. McDaniel to enter the race against Mr. Wicker.\n\nYet even as he formally declared his bid last week, Mr. McDaniel did not rule out changing races.\n\n\u201cWhile it is certain that Mississippi will have two U.S. Senate races this year, I am currently focused on my campaign against Roger Wicker,\u201d he said in a statement Monday, \u201cbut all options remain on the table as we determine the best way to ensure that Mississippi elects conservatives to the United States Senate.\u201d\n\nMr. Wicker, for his part, was asked by reporters at the Capitol if he was relieved to see Mr. Cochran step aside. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad news.\u201d\n\nMr. Bryant has not offered any hints about whom he would appoint to replace Mr. Cochran, but Republicans close to the governor said he would not choose Mr. McDaniel.\n\nImmediately after Mr. Cochran put out word on Monday that he would leave the Senate after nearly four decades, the senator\u2019s top aide and close adviser, Brad White, said, \u201cI hope he appoints somebody who can win a general election.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Moore debacle last year in Alabama that handed the Democrats a seat in the Deep South.\n\nMr. Bryant has to date resisted the entreaties. If he does not take the seat, the governor is expected to consider Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, who is also thought to want to run for governor when Mr. Bryant becomes term-limited in 2019, and Secretary of State Delbert Hoseman. Other possibilities include the State House speaker, Philip Gun, and the state auditor, Stacey Pickering.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDemocrats have not won a Senate race in Mississippi since 1982, when the veteran Senator John Stennis defeated Haley Barbour, but state and national Republicans worry about whether their grip on the state\u2019s two seats could be in peril should Mr. McDaniel find success. Last week, David Baria, the State House Democratic leader, announced his intention to run for Mr. Wicker\u2019s seat. Democrats have also wooed Brandon Presley, a cousin to Elvis Presley and the chairman of the state\u2019s Public Service Commission, to run for the Senate.\n\nMike Espy, a former Democratic congressman and agriculture secretary in the Clinton administration, said late Monday that he would consider running for Mr. Cochran\u2019s seat.\n\nMr. Espy, who is African-American and from a prominent Delta family, could be a formidable candidate in a state where black voters make up much of the Democratic Party.\n\nDemocrats are watching which race Mr. McDaniel chooses, hoping to put their most formidable candidate against the state senator.\n\nMr. Cochran has been a genteel presence in the Senate for decades, but in recent years his physical decline has become apparent. On Monday, as the Senate voted on two judicial nominations, he was guided into the chamber by aides and was silent as reporters peppered him with questions.\n\nHis decision to leave opens up the coveted chairman\u2019s spot on the Senate Appropriations Committee, where leadership is determined by seniority. The senator next in line is Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama. Asked if he wants the job, Mr. Shelby said, \u201cIt would be a great honor, but I\u2019m not there yet,\u201d and added, \u201cI would be interested at the proper time.\u201d\n\nLongtime members of the Senate said they were sorry to see Mr. Cochran go. \u201cI\u2019m devastated,\u201d said Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the most senior Democrat on the Appropriations Committee.\n\n\u201cI assumed we would serve out our time together here,\u201d Mr. Leahy said, adding, \u201cHe has always, always, always kept his word, and I wish to heck some other senators around here would learn to do that.\u201d", "keywords": ["retirement", "senate", "run", "gop", "seat", "cochran", "mr", "wicker", "senator", "announces", "state", "mcdaniel", "thad", "opening", "bryant"], "polarity": 0.09324052853464618, "subjectivity": 0.33873256373256366},

{"title": "\n                    Once Outspoken, Paul Ryan Wields His Speaker\u2019s Gavel Gingerly                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/us/politics/speaker-paul-ryan-trump.html", "text": "\u201cI think Ryan\u2019s expectations had to be dramatically reduced when Trump became president,\u201d said Peter Wehner, a onetime adviser to former President George W. Bush who is close to the speaker. \u201cI think in a lot of ways he was forced into a defensive posture rather than an offensive posture.\u201d\n\nTo supporters like Mr. Wehner, Mr. Ryan\u2019s approach is pure pragmatism and smart politics. Facing a divided Republican conference and a mercurial president of his party, they say, he has little choice but to curb some of his own instincts, work behind the scenes and steer Mr. Trump gently. He also must guide House Republicans into a very difficult midterm election campaign, where his main job is to ensure that vulnerable members get re-elected. And those close to Mr. Ryan note that, with the exception of trade, he has not had serious policy disagreements with the president.\n\nBut Mr. Ryan had modeled himself as a different kind of leader, the youthful face of a new brand of conservatism that was to broaden his party\u2019s appeal and move it beyond 1980s-style Reaganism. His 2012 run for vice president lifted his national profile and fortified his standing. So to critics, the leader once described as \u201cthe intellectual center of Republicans in the House\u201d has abandoned principles to hang onto a job he ostensibly never wanted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of saying deep in his heart there is a different Paul Ryan,\u201d said Charles J. Sykes, a conservative commentator and former radio host in Mr. Ryan\u2019s home state of Wisconsin, who for years promoted Mr. Ryan as a potential presidential candidate.\n\nConservative critiques of Mr. Trump, from senators such as Jeff Flake of Arizona and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, have gone beyond policy disagreements, to temperament, defenses of democratic institutions and law enforcement, and the conduct of foreign policy. And other Republican leaders are speaking out. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, is giving almost daily speeches on the Senate floor pushing for action on a modest but bipartisan bill to fortify the existing background check system for gun purchases.\n\nSenator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Finance Committee and a loud supporter of Mr. Trump, nonetheless scorched his tariffs as \u201ca tax hike the American people don\u2019t need and can\u2019t afford.\u201d\n\nMr. Ryan has repeatedly urged Mr. Trump to abandon the tariffs in private, according to one person familiar with their conversations. In public, he has held his tongue. He declined to be interviewed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI always imagined that there was room for an alternative conservative vision to Trumpism, and Paul Ryan was ideally suited to be that leader of a non-Trumpist conservative Republican Party, but he\u2019s chosen not to assume that role,\u201d Mr. Sykes said. \u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing to see he\u2019s become so comfortable as an ally and an enabler of Trump.\u201d\n\nFor Democrats, the speaker\u2019s deference to Mr. Trump is the stuff of ridicule \u2014 and a constitutional dereliction of duty by the man three steps from the presidency.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine Tip O\u2019Neill or Sam Rayburn or any of the portraits in this gallery saying, \u2018I don\u2019t know whether I can be for that, I\u2019ve got to go down the street and ask permission of the president\u2019?\u201d asked Representative Anna G. Eshoo, Democrat of California, referring to previous speakers whose portraits hang just outside the House chamber.\n\nTo be sure, Mr. Ryan has had some achievements, notably the rewrite of the federal tax code, which for the speaker marked the realization of a long-held dream. He pushed a repeal of the Affordable Care Act through the House, only to see it die in the Senate. And he helped negotiate a two-year budget deal that should bring some peace to Washington even as it balloons federal spending.\n\n\u201cSpeaker Ryan has taken on all the challenges of the modern speakership and deftly kept the conference united while advancing an historic conservative agenda,\u201d said Mr. Ryan\u2019s spokeswoman, AshLee Strong. She cited in particular the tax code rewrite and the budget deal\u2019s provisions for \u201cthe rebuilding of our depleted military.\u201d\n\nMr. Ryan has not always been so deferential. When Mr. Trump attacked a Mexican-American judge during the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Ryan called the comments the \u201ctextbook definition of a racist comment.\u201d When the infamous Access Hollywood tape came out, showing Mr. Trump boasting of sexually assaulting women, Mr. Ryan saw to it that Mr. Trump was disinvited to a rally in Wisconsin.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Boehner, who was effectively pushed out by conservatives in his unruly conference. Mr. Ryan told his colleagues then that he would accept the speakership only if all factions would unite behind him.\n\nTo a certain extent, he has succeeded.\n\nBut in the name of unity, he has governed with a light hand. Last month, the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee confronted Mr. Ryan after they concluded that the House Intelligence Committee had leaked a senator\u2019s private texts \u2014 a serious breach of protocol. Although the senators raised concerns about the direction of the committee under its chairman, Devin Nunes of California, Mr. Ryan apparently chose not to intervene.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe speaker heard the senators on their concerns and encouraged them to take them up directly with their counterparts,\u201d said his spokeswoman, Ms. Strong.\n\nIf Mr. Ryan is known for one quality, House Republicans say, it is his willingness to listen. Members of his conference view him as \u201cinclusive and fair,\u201d said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania.\n\nBut in a chamber where 218 votes are required to pass legislation, Mr. Ryan still faces the same fundamental problem as his predecessor: He has difficulty bringing his fractious conference together. That means he must watch his step.\n\nUnlike Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader, who was speaker from 2007 to 2011, he is not a forceful presence in the House chamber. As speaker, Ms. Pelosi ruled the House with an iron fist, guiding dozens of bills large and small into law. She engineered passage of even doomed bills like a climate change bill that died in the Senate \u2014 and likely cost Democrats seats in the 2010 Republican landslide. She emerged as the undisputable face of her caucus, to some members\u2019 chagrin.\n\nThat is not Mr. Ryan\u2019s style.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for anyone be a strong speaker in the traditional sense around here because the speaker is only as strong as his conference allows him to be,\u201d Mr. Dent said. \u201cAnd because on many issues the speaker cannot get 218 Republican votes, that weakens his position.\u201d\n\nApart from the tax overhaul, that has made for narrow legislative proposals. With Republicans under intense pressure to address gun violence after the high school massacre in Parkland, Fla., Mr. Ryan swatted away any suggestion last week that the House would take expansive action.\n\nThe chamber has already adopted a measure to make modest changes to the national instant background check database, coupled with a measure pushed by the gun lobby to expand the reach of concealed weapons permits. The speaker said Republican leaders now are waiting for the Senate to act.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to micromanage this,\u201d he said at a news conference.\n\nBut there are consequences to Mr. Ryan\u2019s low-key style. Big issues like immigration are languishing with no resolution in sight. Causes that were once Mr. Ryan\u2019s signature fights \u2014 an exploding budget deficit, soaring Medicare and Social Security spending and an entrenched welfare state \u2014 are on nobody\u2019s must-do list. Even Mr. Boehner, never viewed as a policymaking powerhouse, at least tried to negotiate a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with the White House that was to slow entitlement spending, cut other parts of the government and raise revenue to balance the budget.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Ryan\u2019s break with Mr. Trump on trade came only after several other Republicans made clear that they were not standing by the president. Republicans are running for re-election on the strength of the economy, hoping that voters credit their policies, especially the tax cuts. But a trade war marked by a spike in consumer prices could jeopardize their survival strategy.\n\nTo Representative Brian Mast, Republican of Florida and a combat veteran who lost both his legs in Afghanistan, Mr. Ryan\u2019s suggestion that the House wait for the Senate to act on guns is not good enough after the Parkland slaughter.\n\n\u201cIf we believe that tax reform is a do-or-die issue that we have to get done but we can\u2019t say that protecting our kids is that same kind of issue, then that\u2019s not leadership,\u201d said Mr. Mast, who backed an assault weapons ban after the bloodshed in Parkland.\n\nConservatives, meanwhile, have put Mr. Ryan on notice that he does not have free rein. Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, was instrumental in the ouster of Mr. Boehner, and he suggested last month that a misstep on immigration in particular could cost Mr. Ryan his job.\n\n\u201cI can say that it is a defining moment for this speaker,\u201d Mr. Meadows said then. \u201cIf he gets it wrong, it will have consequences for him.\u201d", "keywords": ["ryans", "gingerly", "wields", "speaker", "tax", "republican", "mr", "trump", "paul", "ryan", "speakers", "gavel", "outspoken", "house", "senate", "republicans"], "polarity": 0.06498809204561418, "subjectivity": 0.5022628305814147},

The two celebrated Mr. Trump\u2019s decision in December to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and move the American Embassy there from Tel Aviv in defiance of much of the rest of the world.\n\nMr. Netanyahu extolled Mr. Trump for the decision, comparing him to three of the most important figures in the history of the Jewish people: King Cyrus of Persia, who 2,500 years ago freed the Jews from exile in Babylon and permitted them to return to Jerusalem; Lord Arthur James Balfour, the British foreign secretary whose declaration in 1917 first paved the way for a Jewish homeland in Palestine; and President Harry S. Truman, who recognized Israel\u2019s existence 11 minutes after it declared independence in 1948.\n\nJust as Israelis remember those historical figures, Mr. Netanyahu said, \u201cwe remember how a few weeks ago President Donald J. Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. President,\u201d he continued, \u201cthis will be remembered by our people through the ages. As you just said, others talked about it. You did it.\u201d\n\nUnlike Mr. Trump, however, Mr. Netanyahu mentioned the goal of peace with the Palestinians only in passing and focused instead on the topic he always makes his top priority when he visits Washington, namely Iran.\n\nHe hoped to use the visit to encourage Mr. Trump to tear up President Barack Obama\u2019s agreement with Tehran limiting its nuclear program or renegotiate it to toughen its provisions, particularly with respect to ballistic missiles. He also sought consensus on how to counter Iran\u2019s presence in Syria.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIran must be stopped,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said. \u201cThat is our common challenge.\u201d\n\nHe voiced deep skepticism about the prospect of a Palestinian state, recalling how Gaza fell under the control of Hamas after Israel withdrew. \u201cYou can bring models, theoretical models, say it will be good if we give them a state,\u201d he told the reporters. \u201cEmpirically, it doesn\u2019t work with what we see. When we leave land, terror organizations take it up. Immediately.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump, by contrast, was still more interested in seeking what he has called \u201cthe ultimate deal\u201d between Israel and the Palestinians. \u201cWe\u2019re working on it very hard,\u201d he said with Mr. Netanyahu at his side in the Oval Office. \u201cLook, it would be a great achievement even from a humanitarian standpoint.

In response to the president\u2019s Jerusalem move, they declared that they no longer saw the United States as a neutral broker with the Israelis. Mr. Trump then withheld $65 million in aid for Palestinian refugees.\n\nBut Mr. Kushner went to the United Nations recently to hear Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian leader, speak in an effort to show respect shortly after the president publicly pressed Israel on settlement construction in the West Bank.\n\nThe Monday meeting came at a time when both Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu are under increasing domestic pressure from investigations bearing down on them and their families. Shortly before their get-together, Mr. Trump was lashing out at the investigation into whether his team cooperated with Russia during the 2016 election, while reports from Israel indicated that a former confidant of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s had made a deal with the police in a corruption investigation of the prime minister.\n\n\u201cThey have an awful lot in common and they both may be desperately in need of a friend and someone who understands what they\u2019re going through,\u201d said Mara Rudman, a former deputy special envoy for Middle East peace under Mr. Obama. \u201cAnd they happen to be showing it for the world to see.\u201d\n\nMr. Netanyahu later said their mutual woes \u2014 they both use the phrase \u201cwitch hunt\u201d to describe the inquiries into their activities \u2014 never came up during their meeting. Instead, they relished the chance to showcase their partnership during the part of their session when cameras were on.\n\n\u201cThe relationship has never been better,\u201d Mr. Trump declared.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been stronger,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu agreed.\n\nMr. Trump has made his decision to move the embassy a selling point among his supporters, lauding it during a recent speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference as one of his major achievements. His administration announced that it would formally open the Jerusalem embassy in May to coincide with the 70th anniversary of Israel\u2019s independence by redesignating an existing consular facility.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe president said on Monday that he may attend. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at coming,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIf I can, I will.\u201d\n\nAs he has before, Mr. Trump argued that his decision to recognize Jerusalem resolved a tough issue dividing Israel and the Palestinians. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken it off the table,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this gives us a real opportunity for peace.\u201d\n\nHardly any veterans of Middle East peacemaking, including some who support moving the embassy, share this view. Mr. Trump\u2019s unilateral declaration does not mean that the Palestinians have given up on Jerusalem; instead, they have dug in. Many former negotiators have envisioned a peace deal in which both sides operate their capitals out of Jerusalem, the Israelis in the west and the Palestinians in the east.\n\nAs he often does, Mr. Trump boasted that he had already cut the cost of building a new embassy, but he seemed to be conflating two different expenses. \u201cThey put an order in front of my desk last week for a billion dollars,\u201d he said. \u201cI said a billion? What\u2019s that for? They said, \u2018We\u2019re going to build an embassy.\u2019 I said we\u2019re not going to spend a billion dollars. We\u2019re actually doing it for about $250,000.\u201d\n\nThe State Department has estimated that construction of a new embassy will cost about $500 million.

In turn, insurers have shifted more of those costs onto consumers. Saddled with high deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs that expose them to a drug\u2019s rising list price, many people are paying thousands of dollars a month merely to survive.\n\nFor more than a year, President Trump and Democrats in Congress have promised to take action on high drug prices, but despite a flurry of proposals, little has changed.\n\nThese are the stories of Americans living daily with the reality of high-cost drugs. And there are millions of others just like them.\n\nSkipping drugs she can\u2019t afford\n\nVideo Skipping Drugs She Can't Afford\n\nSaundra Johnson, 57, Minneapolis\n\nWith an annual income of less than $20,000, Ms. Johnson doesn\u2019t come close to being able to afford the 12 medications her doctors have prescribed for congestive heart failure, diabetes and related complications.\n\nShe is one of the many who finds herself \u201cin between,\u201d as one of her doctors described it, narrowly missing the requirements for assistance but making too little to afford her prescriptions.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown of the math: Ms. Johnson\u2019s Social Security disability income of $19,560 in 2017 placed her above the cutoff for receiving additional government assistance for her prescriptions, called Extra Help, even though nearly every dollar of her income is already spoken for, from paying Medicare premiums to food and other household expenses.\n\nMedicare rules prohibit her from using drug co-pay coupons, which are commonly used by those with private insurance. And Novo Nordisk, the company that sells her fast-acting insulin, Novolog, and her diabetes medication, Victoza, requires low-income Medicare beneficiaries to first spend $1,000 on drugs in each calendar year before they can qualify for free drugs through its program. In a cruel twist, Ms. Johnson doesn\u2019t have that $1,000 to spend, so she resorts to not taking some drugs for months until she reaches the company\u2019s threshold.\n\nThese are tough choices. Sometimes she stops taking the short-acting Novolog, staying on the longer-acting insulin, Tresiba, as well as her heart medications, like bumetanide and digoxin. \u201cI prioritize the heart stuff over the insulin because the heart stuff is more immediate,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Johnson understands the risks; she was a health educator for people with H.I.V. and AIDS, helping patients enroll in programs that lowered their drug costs.\n\nHer blood sugar has risen dangerously high, and a little over a year ago, she was hospitalized for three weeks because she said she wasn\u2019t on the right diuretic to reduce excess fluid.\n\nLast June, she was approved for the Novo Nordisk assistance program, allowing her to begin taking the Novolog insulin again. As of mid-November, Ms. Johnson had spent $2,782 on prescription drugs, not counting the cost of the free insulin, according to a report provided by her pharmacy.\n\nFor another drug, Entresto, an expensive treatment for heart failure, Ms. Johnson participates in a clinical trial that provides the drug for free. Once that ends, she faces another hurdle: \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a discount or I\u2019m not going to be on Entresto anymore.\u201d\n\nIn January, she started all over again. \u201cI\u2019m stuck between a rock and a hard place, and I\u2019m sure a lot of other people are as well.\u201d\n\nTHE BACKGROUND:\n\nMedicare\u2019s prescription drug program, known as Part D, has been a lifeline for seniors and disabled people. Those with the lowest incomes can qualify for federally subsidized Extra Help to reduce their costs. But to be eligible, an individual must earn less than $18,210 and a married couple living together cannot earn more than $24,690.\n\nIn a statement, Novo Nordisk said it provided some forms of insulin at reduced costs to help patients who are struggling. \u201cThis patient is an exceptional example, reminding us that we need to continuously evaluate how we keep our support programs sustainable while covering as many of those in need as possible.\u201d\n\n\u2018We always seem to fall through the cracks\u2019\n\nImage Credit Narayan Mahon for The New York Times\n\nAbigail Bostwick, 37, of Tomahawk, Wis.\n\nMs. Bostwick was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2013. Insurance covered the first drug she took, Tecfidera, but required her to contribute $1,000 a month.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t cry when I was handed the diagnosis of M.S.,\u201d Ms. Bostwick said. But after learning how much prescriptions would cost, \u201cThat was when I felt truly helpless.\u201d\n\nMs. Bostwick, a former journalist, has coverage through her husband\u2019s employer because she can no longer work. They hit their $4,500 annual deductible in the very first month of every year because Gilenya, the drug she had been taking until last fall, carried a list price of about $5,500 a month. The couple put aside $375 every month to make sure they could cover that deductible.\n\nThe Bostwicks, who recently decided to divorce, have drained their savings, given up family vacations, and sold a motorcycle, a car, furniture and other belongings. Changes to her husband\u2019s employee benefits this year means another $1,000 out of pocket annually. Ms. Bostwick, who is disabled, said she plans to sign up for Medicare coverage after she loses access to her husband\u2019s insurance.\n\nMs. Bostwick suffered severe side effects that led her to stop taking Gilenya, and she\u2019s recently been approved to begin a new drug, Ocrevus.\n\n\u201cThis is such a huge bill and it\u2019s not really something that we can forgo,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re your basic middle-class couple. We don\u2019t have an extravagant lifestyle or anything like that. But we always seem to fall through the cracks.\u201d\n\nTHE BACKGROUND:\n\nThe prices of several multiple sclerosis drugs have shot up in recent years. The cost of Gilenya, the drug that Ms. Bostwick took, has nearly doubled to almost $92,000 a year since Novartis got approval for it in 2010.\n\nIn a statement, Novartis pointed to its patient assistance program that eliminates monthly out-of-pocket costs for most commercially insured patients (Ms. Bostwick said her family income is too high to qualify for most assistance programs).\n\nThere are also signs that companies may be getting the message. Ocrevus, the drug Ms. Bostwick will soon begin taking, was approved in 2017 and Genentech, its manufacturer, announced it would price the new drug at 25 percent below the list price of Rebif, the older drug that it beat in clinical trials.\n\nA shell game of debt\n\nImage Credit Andrew Burton for The New York Times\n\nMatthew Botts, 34, Oakland, Calif.\n\nIn 2007, Mr. Botts was 24 and three weeks into his first year at the University of San Francisco School of Law when he was diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia, a blood cancer. His doctor prescribed Gleevec, an effective but expensive medication that until recently cost more than $140,000 per year. The price recently began to go down in the face of generic competition.\n\nMr. Botts had no money to spare. For the first months of his treatment, he was able to take another patient\u2019s unused medications that were no longer needed (she was dying and his oncologist had connected them). Then, after receiving coverage through a former employer, Mr. Botts moved up his wedding date so he could switch to his wife\u2019s policy. But between his deductible and out-of-pocket costs, his expenses added up. Mr. Botts applied for assistance through a program run by Gleevec\u2019s maker, Novartis, but said he was rejected because his wife made slightly too much.\n\nWithout options, Mr. Botts tapped into his law school loans. \u201cAt 24, when you\u2019re really not making any money, you don\u2019t really have any options other than that,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Botts dropped out of law school. \u201cWhen everyone else is 24, 25 and going out and partying,\u201d he was worried about ensuring he had money \u201cso I could make sure I paid for my chemotherapy meds and still go to class.\u201d\n\nToday, he owes more than $73,000. He works at a debt collection company in the Bay Area, managing corporate relationships for banks. The irony is not lost on him. \u201cWe have a huge pile of medical debt that resulted from all of this. It just hasn\u2019t been paid,\u201d he said. \u201cI will be paying those up until the day I die.\u201d\n\nTHE BACKGROUND:\n\nThere\u2019s no dispute that Gleevec is a breakthrough cancer drug. It is also a very expensive one whose cost has increased sharply over the years. When it was launched in 2001, Gleevec cost $26,000 a year. That price increased significantly, to about $146,000 in 2016, before the drug lost its patent protection and began facing generic competition. The drug\u2019s price has been falling since then, though not as quickly as some hoped.\n\nIn a statement, Novartis, the maker of Gleevec, said it was not familiar with Mr. Botts\u2019 situation, but that it \u201coffers one of the most significant patient assistance programs (PAPs) in the industry.\u201d The company suggests that patients contact its assistance program, Patient Assistance Now Oncology.\n\nOverall, cancer drug prices are increasing at a rate much faster than inflation.\n\nStockpiling insulin\n\nImage Credit Andrea Morales for The New York Times\n\nAmanda Walker, 34, of Memphis, Tenn.\n\nDiabetes has driven nearly all of Ms. Walker\u2019s adult life.\n\nMs. Walker, who was diagnosed with diabetes at age 9, dropped out of college, forgoing her aspirations to be an artist, in part because she needed health insurance. She sought out retail jobs with coverage, selling suits at Men\u2019s Warehouse and Jos. A. Bank. She got an insulin pump, helping keep her stable. Even then, she struggled to pay her out-of-pocket costs, spending $300 a month for insulin and other supplies.\n\nLast fall, she became unemployed after taking a new job that didn\u2019t work out. Without coverage, Ms. Walker stockpiled empty vials of insulin in her refrigerator, using a syringe to suck out whatever drops were left. She once turned to Facebook, pleading for help, and within 45 minutes a nearby resident offered her two insulin pens.\n\nBy December, Ms. Walker obtained subsidized health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. She pays a premium of $3.95 a month and $25 a month for insulin.\n\nBut even though her health coverage is more secure, she still worries that she could wind up rationing her insulin again if the health care law were repealed.\n\n\u201cI think in an alternate universe, there\u2019s a me that\u2019s not diabetic,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I wonder what she\u2019s doing. What life is she living? I\u2019m stuck.\u201d\n\nTHE BACKGROUND:\n\nIn the United States, three manufacturers dominate the insulin market \u2014 Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi \u2014 and a recent study found that prices nearly tripled from 2002 to 2013.\n\nThe drug makers have been accused of price-fixing in several patient lawsuits, and several states are investigating.\n\nIn response, the companies have rolled out programs, such as one through CVS Health, that reduce costs for the uninsured or those with high-deductible coverage.\n\nDespite the uproar, all three manufacturers raised their list prices again in 2017, according to the Gold Standard Drug Database from Elsevier, an information analytics company.\n\nA common childhood ailment carries a big price tag\n\nImage Credit Melissa Lyttle for The New York Times\n\nAviva Williams, 42, Los Angeles\n\nLast year, Ms. Williams\u2019s four-year-old daughter, Amy, began complaining about an itchy bottom \u2014 a classic sign, her doctor later informed her, of pinworms. Ms. Williams gave Amy an over-the-counter medicine and her daughter\u2019s symptoms seemed to improve.\n\nWhen the pinworms returned a while later, the doctor prescribed albendazole, a prescription treatment that has been around for decades. Ms. Williams thought little of it, until she checked the price with her pharmacist. The drug cost $724 for a four-tablet treatment, and according to her drug plan, she had to pay about $250. Because her doctor recommended that all four family members be treated, she was suddenly facing a $1,000 bill.\n\nTo save money, Ms. Williams decided to fill prescriptions for her daughter and herself, but to buy the over-the-counter treatment for her husband and younger daughter, who did not have symptoms.\n\nVideo Treating a Common Children's Ailment Isn't Cheap\n\nA few weeks later, Ms. Williams found pinworms in her younger daughter\u2019s diaper, and had to pay $250 for another round of albendazole.\n\nShe said she is furious that she was forced to pay $750 for an old drug. \u201cThey price it because they can,\u201d said Ms. Williams said. \u201cWall Street decided they could make money off prescription drugs, which is just scary and depressing.\u201d\n\nTHE BACKGROUND:\n\nAlthough albendazole lost its patent protection years ago, just one company, Impax Laboratories, sells the drug. Its high price dates to 2010, when a company called Amedra Pharmaceuticals \u2014 later acquired by Impax \u2014 bought the right to sell it from GlaxoSmithKline, and raised the price to about $120 a pill from roughly $6.\n\nA spokesman for Impax Laboratories declined to say why Amedra raised the price.\n\nMs. Williams saved her bottle of albendazole as a bitter reminder of how she once had to pay hundreds of dollars for a handful of pills. The other day she noticed a detail she had not seen before: Impax does not even make the drug. It is still manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline.\n\nTwo battlefields: the illness and the bills\n\nImage Credit Eric Ginnard for The New York Times\n\nCarter Knutson, 68, Bloomington, Ill.\n\nAt the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., Mr. Knutson had begun a two-pronged treatment aimed at attacking a large tumor threatening his pulmonary artery. As chemotherapy dripped into his bloodstream, he learned that his insurance company wouldn\u2019t cover the second phase, a pill called Xeloda that he could take at home.\n\nDoctors at Mayo wrote to the Knutsons\u2019 prescription benefits manager, CVS Caremark, to explain that Mr. Knutson\u2019s kidney disease made him a bad candidate for the usual treatment, with the chemotherapy drug cisplatin.\n\nAfter a denial and failing two appeals, Mr. Knutson, a retired farm equipment salesman, and his wife Julie, decided to pay for the drug themselves. \u201cWe felt like we didn\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Mrs. Knutson said. After using a coupon they found online, the pill cost $1,000 per prescription. After three courses of the drug, Mr. Knutson\u2019s tumor shrank enough to enable surgery. He is now in remission.\n\nAfter the operation, the Knutsons appealed again \u2014 this time through the state\u2019s insurance commissioner. Within 24 hours, the reviewer ordered CVS to cover the pills.\n\nThe Knutsons received a check in July 2016 for $2,790.81; they turned around and donated $3,000 to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nThe fighting took its toll, Mr. Knutson said. \u201cWhen you are in that situation, you are really fragile, not as capable as you are when you are healthy in an everyday situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re trying to make it so difficult that you just give up.\u201d\n\nTHE BACKGROUND:\n\nMr. Knutson\u2019s situation is a good reminder that even if your insurer rejects a treatment or drug, you have the right to appeal \u2014 often more than once. He only won when he appealed to an outside reviewer through the Illinois insurance department, an external process required by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhile CVS Caremark said in a statement that it respected the care provided by the Mayo Clinic\u2019s oncologists, it added: \u201cThis case illustrates that medical experts can disagree on whether experimental therapy may work for a patient, and we certainly hope it has for Mr. Knutson.\u201d\n\nA father crosses the border for his son\n\nVideo Crossing the Border for His Son's Prescription\n\nJonathan Yeagley, 61, Berwyn, Pa.\n\nEvery three months, Mr. Yeagley, a stock trader, hops into his car and drives seven hours \u2014 390 miles \u2014 from his home outside Philadelphia to a Walmart half a mile across the Canadian border. There, he buys Xeljanz to treat his son Jonathan\u2019s alopecia areata, a type of hair loss caused by an immune disorder. He drives back the same day.\n\nIn 2016, Independence Blue Cross, Mr. Yeagley\u2019s insurer at the time, rejected coverage of the drug because Xeljanz is approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis, not alopecia. Mr. Yeagley appealed and lost his case; an outside reviewer wrote that there\u2019s not enough evidence that the drug is effective against alopecia. In 2017, Mr. Yeagley switched to another insurer that does not cover prescription drugs.\n\nThere are no approved drug treatments for the condition, and Mr. Yeagley\u2019s son\u2019s doctor at Yale University, Brett King, has found Xeljanz effective at regrowing hair for some patients. (Dr. King is a consultant for the drug\u2019s maker, Pfizer.) Once a year, Mr. Yeagley uses a coupon from Pfizer that covers about three months of the drug, but for the rest of the year he is on his own.\n\nIn the United States, Xeljanz costs about $50,000 a year (through a drug discount website). That\u2019s after Pfizer raised the price of Xeljanz by nearly 8 percent in January. In Canada, the price tag is $15,000.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have that kind of money to throw away,\u201d said Mr. Yeagley, who has made five trips so far. Mr. Yeagley\u2019s son spoke on FaceTime with a Canadian doctor who asked for pictures and reviewed laboratory results before writing a prescription so the Yeagleys could legally obtain the drug in Canada.\n\nJonathan, who is 20, worries about shouldering the costs in the future. \u201cI don\u2019t tell him that I think about it a lot but I do think about it a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful for what he does for me but I don\u2019t know how long it can go on.\u201d\n\nTHE BACKGROUND:\n\nDrug prices are cheaper in Canada, where an independent quasi-judicial body is supposed to ensure that pharmaceutical companies do not charge excessive prices.\n\nIn another twist, the price of Xeljanz has come under scrutiny because it was developed in part based on research by the National Institutes of Health, a federal agency. Some consumer groups and lawmakers have questioned whether drugs developed with taxpayer money should carry lower price tags.\n\nIn a statement, Pfizer said it is studying medications to treat alopecia. It has said it spent more than a $1 billion on \u201cthe discovery, development and commercialization of Xeljanz.\u201d", "keywords": ["price", "costs", "pay", "mr", "treatment", "assistance", "ms", "insulin", "drugs", "drug", "bostwick"], "polarity": 0.06421070973255438, "subjectivity": 0.3812693509295451},

Mr. Madison shot Ms. Greene, too, wounding her.\n\nMr. Madison remembers none of this. He has suffered at least two severe strokes, and he is blind and incontinent. His speech is slurred, and what he says does not always make sense.\n\nHe has asked that his mother be told of his strokes, but his mother is dead. He soils himself, saying \u201cno one will let me out to use the bathroom,\u201d though there is a toilet in his cell. He says he plans to move to Florida.

His second conviction was thrown out after prosecutors committed misconduct by using expert testimony to tell the jury about evidence never properly introduced.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt Mr. Madison\u2019s third trial, the jury voted to sentence him to life in prison. But Judge Ferrill D. McRae, of Mobile County Circuit Court, overrode that verdict and sentenced Mr. Madison to death.\n\nI interviewed Judge McRae in 2011, not long before he died. I had sought him out because he had achieved a rare distinction. He had overridden six jury verdicts calling for life sentences, a state record, while never rejecting a jury\u2019s recommendation of death.\n\nAlabama juries are not notably squeamish about the death penalty, but Judge McRae said they needed to be corrected when they were seized by an impulse toward mercy. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t have something like that,\u201d he said of judicial overrides, \u201ca jury with no experience in other cases would be making the ultimate decision, based on nothing.\u201d\n\nAlabama abolished judicial overrides last year.\n\nIn 2016, Mr. Madison came very close to being put to death. A deadlocked eight-member Supreme Court refused to vacate a stay of execution issued by a federal appeals court, with the court\u2019s four conservative members saying they would have let the execution proceed. Justice Antonin Scalia had died a few months before, leaving the Supreme Court short-handed. Had Justice Scalia lived, Mr. Madison would almost certainly be dead by now.\n\nThe case took some additional procedural twists, and Mr. Madison returned to the Supreme Court in January after a state court again ruled against him. The Supreme Court stayed his execution, though the court\u2019s three most conservative members \u2014 Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch \u2014 said they would have let it go forward.\n\nThe case, Madison v. Alabama, No. 17-7505, will be argued in the fall, and it will give the court a chance to consider some profound questions.\n\n\u201cMr. Madison is one among a growing number of aging prisoners who remain on death row in this country for ever longer periods of time,\u201d Justice Stephen G.

Wearing a low-cut top with a black bra visible underneath, she writhed lustily for the camera and flashed her unmistakable smile.\n\nThen, the former first lady\u2019s doppelg\u00e4nger began to strip.\n\nThe video, which appeared on the online forum Reddit, was what\u2019s known as a \u201cdeepfake\u201d \u2014 an ultrarealistic fake video made with artificial intelligence software. It was created using a program called FakeApp, which superimposed Mrs. Obama\u2019s face onto the body of a pornographic film actress. The hybrid was uncanny \u2014 if you didn\u2019t know better, you might have thought it was really her.\n\nUntil recently, realistic computer-generated video was a laborious pursuit available only to big-budget Hollywood productions or cutting-edge researchers. Social media apps like Snapchat include some rudimentary face-morphing technology.\n\nBut in recent months, a community of hobbyists has begun experimenting with more powerful tools, including FakeApp \u2014 a program that was built by an anonymous developer using open-source software written by Google. FakeApp makes it free and relatively easy to create realistic face swaps and leave few traces of manipulation. Since a version of the app appeared on Reddit in January, it has been downloaded more than 120,000 times, according to its creator.\n\nDeepfakes are one of the newest forms of digital media manipulation, and one of the most obviously mischief-prone. It\u2019s not hard to imagine this technology\u2019s being used to smear politicians, create counterfeit revenge porn or frame people for crimes. Lawmakers have already begun to worry about how deepfakes could be used for political sabotage and propaganda.\n\nEven on morally lax sites like Reddit, deepfakes have raised eyebrows. Recently, FakeApp set off a panic after Motherboard, the technology site, reported that people were using it to create pornographic deepfakes of celebrities. Pornhub, Twitter and other sites quickly banned the videos, and Reddit closed a handful of deepfake groups, including one with nearly 100,000 members.\n\nBefore the Reddit deepfake groups were closed, they hosted a mixture of users trading video-editing tips and showing off their latest forgeries. A post titled \u201c3D face reconstruction for additional angles\u201d sat next to videos with titles like \u201c(Not) Olivia Wilde playing with herself.\u201d\n\nSome users on Reddit defended deepfakes and blamed the media for overhyping their potential for harm. Others moved their videos to alternative platforms, rightly anticipating that Reddit would crack down under its rules against nonconsensual pornography. And a few expressed moral qualms about putting the technology into the world.\n\nThen, they kept making more.\n\nThe deepfake creator community is now in the internet\u2019s shadows. But while out in the open, it gave an unsettling peek into the future.\n\n\u201cThis is turning into an episode of Black Mirror,\u201d wrote one Reddit user. The post raised the ontological questions at the heart of the deepfake debate: Does a naked image of Person A become a naked image of Person B if Person B\u2019s face is superimposed in a seamless and untraceable way? In a broader sense, on the internet, what is the difference between representation and reality?\n\nThe user then signed off with a shrug: \u201cGodspeed rebels.\u201d\n\nMaking Deepfakes\n\nAfter lurking for several weeks in Reddit\u2019s deepfake community, I decided to see how easy it was to create a (safe for work, nonpornographic) deepfake using my own face.\n\nI started by downloading FakeApp and enlisting two technical experts to help me. The first was Mark McKeague, a colleague in The New York Times\u2019s research and development department. The second was a deepfake creator I found through Reddit, who goes by the nickname Derpfakes.\n\nBecause of the controversial nature of deepfakes, Derpfakes would not give his or her real name. Derpfakes started posting deepfake videos on YouTube a few weeks ago, specializing in humorous offerings like Nicolas Cage playing Superman. The account has also posted some how-to videos on deepfake creation.\n\nWhat I learned is that making a deepfake isn\u2019t simple. But it\u2019s not rocket science, either.\n\nThe first step is to find, or rent, a moderately powerful computer. FakeApp uses a suite of machine learning tools called TensorFlow, which was developed by Google\u2019s A.I. division and released to the public in 2015. The software teaches itself to perform image-recognition tasks through trial and error. The more processing power on hand, the faster it works.\n\nTo get more speed, Mark and I used a remote server rented through Google Cloud Platform. It provided enough processing power to cut the time frame down to hours, rather than the days or weeks it might take on my laptop.\n\nOnce Mark set up the remote server and loaded FakeApp on it, we were on to the next step: data collection.\n\nPicking the right source data is crucial. Short video clips are easier to manipulate than long clips, and scenes shot at a single angle produce better results than scenes with multiple angles. Genetics also help. The more the faces resemble each other, the better.\n\nI\u2019m a brown-haired white man with a short beard, so Mark and I decided to try several other brown-haired, stubbled white guys. We started with Ryan Gosling. (Aim high, right?) I also sent Derpfakes, my outsourced Reddit expert, several video options to choose from.\n\nNext, we took several hundred photos of my face, and gathered images of Mr. Gosling\u2019s face using a clip from a recent TV appearance. FakeApp uses these images to train the deep learning model and teach it to emulate our facial expressions.\n\nTo get the broadest photo set possible, I twisted my head at different angles, making as many different faces as I could.\n\nMark then used a program to crop those images down, isolating just our faces, and manually deleted any blurred or badly cropped photos. He then fed the frames into FakeApp. In all, we used 417 photos of me, and 1,113 of Mr. Gosling.\n\nWhen the images were ready, Mark pressed \u201cstart\u201d on FakeApp, and the training began. His computer screen filled with images of my face and Mr. Gosling\u2019s face, as the program tried to identify patterns and similariti es.\n\nAbout eight hours later, after our model had been sufficiently trained, Mark used FakeApp to finish putting my face on Mr. Gosling\u2019s body. The video was blurry and bizarre, and Mr. Gosling\u2019s face occasionally flickered into view. Only the legally blind would mistake the person in the video for me.\n\nWe did better with a clip of Chris Pratt, the scruffy star of \u201cJurassic World,\u201d whose face shape is a little more similar to mine. For this test, Mark used a bigger data set \u2014 1,861 photos of me, 1,023 of him \u2014 and let the model run overnight.\n\nA few days later, Derpfakes, who had also been training a model, sent me a finished deepfake made using the footage I had sent and a video of the actor Jake Gyllenhaal. This one was much more lifelike, a true hybrid that mixed my facial features with his hair, beard and body.\n\nDerpfakes repeated the process with videos of Jimmy Kimmel and Liev Schreiber, both of which turned out well. As an experienced deepfake creator, Derpfakes had a more intuitive sense of which source videos would produce a clean result, and more experience with the subtle blending and tweaking that takes place at the end of the deepfake process.\n\nIn all, our deepfake experiment took three days and cost $85.96 in Google Cloud Platform credits. That seemed like a small price to pay for stardom.\n\nWhat the App\u2019s Creator Says\n\nAfter the experiment, I reached out to the anonymous creator of FakeApp through an email address on its website. I wanted to know how it felt to create a cutting-edge A.I. tool, only to have it gleefully co-opted by ethically challenged pornographers.\n\nA man wrote back, identifying himself as a software developer in Maryland. Like Derpfakes, the man would not give me his full name, and instead went by his first initial, N. He said he had created FakeApp as a creative experiment and was chagrined to see Reddit\u2019s deepfake community use it for ill.\n\n\u201cI joined the community based around these algorithms when it was very small (less than 500 people),\u201d he wrote, \u201cand as soon as I saw the results I knew this was brilliant tech that should be accessible to anyone who wants to play around with it. I figured I\u2019d take a shot at putting together an easy-to-use package to accomplish that.\u201d\n\nN. said he didn\u2019t support the use of FakeApp to create nonconsensual pornography or other abusive content. And he said he agreed with Reddit\u2019s decision to ban explicit deepfakes. But he defended the product.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve given it a lot of thought,\u201d he said, \u201cand ultimately I\u2019ve decided I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to condemn the technology itself \u2014 which can of course be used for many purposes, good and bad.\u201d\n\nFakeApp is somewhat finicky and hard to use, but it\u2019s easy to imagine it improving quickly. N. said that in the future, FakeApp could be used by all kinds of people to bring high-budget special effects to their personal projects.\n\nDeep learning algorithms, he added, were going to be important in the future, not only as stand-alone apps but as powerful components of many tech products.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s precisely the things that make them so powerful and useful that make them so scary,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s really no limit to what you can apply it to with a little imagination.\u201d\n\n\u2018Next Form of Communication\u2019\n\nOn the day of the school shooting last month in Parkland, Fla., a screenshot of a BuzzFeed News article, \u201cWhy We Need to Take Away White People\u2019s Guns Now More Than Ever,\u201d written by a reporter named Richie Horowitz, began making the rounds on social media.\n\nThe whole thing was fake. No BuzzFeed employee named Richie Horowitz exists, and no article with that title was ever published on the site. But the doctored image pulsed through right-wing outrage channels and was boosted by activists on Twitter. It wasn\u2019t an A.I.-generated deepfake, or even a particularly sophisticated Photoshop job, but it did the trick.\n\nOnline misinformation, no matter how sleekly produced, spreads through a familiar process once it enters our social distribution channels. The hoax gets 50,000 shares, and the debunking an hour later gets 200. The carnival barker gets an algorithmic boost on services like Facebook and YouTube, while the expert screams into the void.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason to believe that deepfake videos will operate any differently. People will share them when they\u2019re ideologically convenient and dismiss them when they\u2019re not. The dupes who fall for satirical stories from The Onion will be fooled by deepfakes, and the scrupulous people who care about the truth will find ways to detect and debunk them.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no choice,\u201d said Hao Li, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Southern California. Mr. Li, who is also the founder of Pinscreen, a company that uses artificial intelligence to create lifelike 3-D avatars, said the weaponization of A.I. was inevitable and would require a sudden shift in public awareness.\n\n\u201cI see this as the next form of communication,\u201d he said. \u201cI worry that people will use it to blackmail others, or do bad things. You have to educate people that this is possible.\u201d\n\nSo, O.K. Here I am, telling you this: An A.I. program powerful enough to turn Michelle Obama into a pornography star, or transform a schlubby newspaper columnist into Jake Gyllenhaal, is in our midst. Manipulated video will soon become far more commonplace.\n\nAnd there\u2019s probably nothing we can do except try to bat the fakes down as they happen, pressure social media companies to fight misinformation aggressively, and trust our eyes a little less every day.\n\nGodspeed, rebels.\n\nKevin Roose is a columnist for Business Day and a writer-at-large for The New York Times Magazine.

Some top White House staff were unaware the president was going to roll out these tariffs until he did so on national television.\n\nMr. Navarro and Mr. Ross have been among the staunchest defenders of the trade action, which would hit global trading partners like Canada and South Korea much more than China, which the administration has described as the primary culprit in putting American metal makers out of business.

Mr. Navarro said he saw the costs as \u201cinsignificant\u201d in the mission to preserve the steel and aluminum industries, which have seen factories pick up and move from the United States to cheaper parts of the world.\n\nThe White House\u2019s plan continued to face fierce criticism, including from Republicans who believe free trade is in the interest of the economy.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, criticized the tariffs for falling more heavily on American allies than on China, which he said had earlier flooded the global market with steel.\n\nEconomists say the tariffs, if applied without exceptions, would harm allies like Canada, South Korea and the European Union, which export more steel to the United States than China does. Shortly after the tariffs were announced, the European Union responded by saying that it was already preparing to levy retaliatory tariffs on American products, including orange juice, bluejeans and Harley-Davidson motorcycles.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re letting China off the hook,\u201d Mr. Graham said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cChina wins when we fight with Europe.\u201d\n\nJoshua B.

But Mr. Bolten said the tariffs would cause \u201chuge damage across broad sectors of the economy\u201d that use steel and aluminum in their products, or that face retaliation from angry trading partners.\n\nThat did not dissuade Mr. Navarro, who doubled down on comments he made on Friday arguing that trading partners would not retaliate against the United States because they fear losing access to the valuable American market.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAll we are asking for is fair and reciprocal trade,\u201d Mr. Navarro said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cWhat we need to do here is keep the rhetoric down.\u201d\n\nSince the announcement, the president has only ratcheted up his language on trade, tweeting several times about trade policy and the disadvantage he believes the United States faces.

Chris Christie of New Jersey, who worked closely on the opioid crisis with Ms. Conway and credited her with urging the president to personalize the issue through his brother\u2019s experience with addiction. \u201cShe\u2019s gotten a bad rap at times, but I think that\u2019s because of some of the really awful people inside the White House who have been trying to hurt her, as opposed to anything the press came up with on its own.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, Ms. Conway has watched, somewhat from the sidelines, as John F.

She also survived efforts to curtail her influence by Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, who for months privately bristled over Ms. Conway\u2019s getting credit for the campaign victory.\n\nBut, that friend said, she learned that if her colleagues did not take her seriously, she could use it to her advantage. She kept her head down while other aides burned out, and kept her access to the president.\n\nIn fact, her portfolio has grown, with the addition of the opioid crisis and coordination with cabinet secretaries, which originally fell under Mr. Kushner\u2019s purview. On Thursday, she put together an opioid summit meeting with cabinet members at the White House, which the president briefly joined.\n\nOther Republicans say her loyalty to Mr. Trump \u2014 and thus her ability to survive in his chaotic White House \u2014 is no virtue.\n\n\u201cShe has no shame,\u201d Tim Miller, a former spokesman for Jeb Bush\u2019s presidential campaign, said in a text message, \u201cand that is a quality the president values.\u201d\n\nMs. Conway, of course, would see it differently.

The analysts work in a warren of cubicles in the basement of a tired building that once housed the Office of Strategic Services, the World War II predecessor to the C.I.A.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe analysts are divided into five teams that largely work in four languages: Arabic, Urdu, French and Somali. The analysts said in interviews that they had notched some significant victories, including a video montage proving that the Islamic State had itself destroyed Al Nuri Grand Mosque in Mosul, Iraq, and a widely seen cartoon in French depicting the miserable life of an Islamic State fighter.\n\nStill, these efforts are a small fraction of what Congress envisioned. A 2015 internal assessment found that the Islamic State had been far more nimble on social media than the United States had been. In May, Congress more than doubled the center\u2019s budget, providing an additional $19 million over its earlier budget of $14 million. But by Jan. 1, the department had spent just $3.6 million of the additional $19 million, Mr. Goldstein said.\n\nJames K. Glassman, the under secretary for public diplomacy during the George W. Bush administration, said the center\u2019s uncertain funding and temporary leadership reflected the administration\u2019s lack of interest in countering either jihadist or Russian propaganda.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got the vehicle to do this work in the center,\u201d Mr. Glassman said. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t have is a secretary of state or a president who\u2019s interested in doing this work.\u201d\n\nMr. Tillerson is focusing his energies instead on drastically shrinking the department, leaving a significant part of its budget unused and hundreds of important decisions unmade.\n\nLast year, the State Department spent just 79 percent of the money that Congress had authorized for the conduct of foreign affairs, the lowest such level in at least 15 years and well down from the 93 percent spent in the final year of the Obama administration, according to an analysis of data from the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nBecause of the hiring and promotion freezes that have left large sums unspent, as well as Mr. Tillerson\u2019s refusal to delegate spending decisions, the department had a backlog of more than 1,400 official requests for Mr. Tillerson\u2019s signoff at the end of last year, according to a former senior diplomat who left the department then.", "keywords": ["dept", "congress", "mr", "continue", "120", "granted", "russian", "money", "efforts", "department", "state", "administration", "meddling", "fight", "spent", "million"], "polarity": 0.05567146331035223, "subjectivity": 0.31080180107957894},

They want to impose work requirements, charge premiums, suspend coverage for people who fail to pay premiums, and restrict eligibility or benefits in other ways. A few states would like to impose time limits on Medicaid coverage for some beneficiaries.\n\nConcern about waivers is bipartisan. Republicans were worried about the cost of some demonstration projects approved by the Obama administration. Democrats are alarmed at work requirements and other policy changes that the Trump administration has approved.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Government Accountability Office found particular problems in the evaluation of a Medicaid waiver granted to Indiana. The state expanded Medicaid, as permitted under the Affordable Care Act, but obtained a federal waiver for policies emphasizing \u201cpersonal responsibility,\u201d including monthly premiums and incentives for healthy behavior.\n\nThe federal government wanted to know how Medicaid beneficiaries were affected by those changes, but it could not get the data it needed from the state, so its evaluation was severely limited, the Government Accountability Office said.\n\nConservatives see Indiana\u2019s Medicaid program as a model, and other states are following suit. The architects of the Indiana plan include Vice President Mike Pence, who was the governor of Indiana from 2013 to January 2017, and Seema Verma, a consultant to the state who is now the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Federal spending under Medicaid waivers now exceeds $100 billion a year, up from $29 billion in 2005 and $49 billion in 2010.\n\nWaivers are typically approved for an initial five-year period, but federal officials often renew and extend waivers without waiting for an evaluation to show whether the project was worthwhile, the Government Accountability Office said.\n\nThe auditors made three recommendations and the Trump administration accepted all of them, saying it recognized the need to conduct rigorous independent evaluations and release the results in a more timely way.\n\nIn granting Medicaid waivers, federal officials typically require states to measure the effects of a policy change on costs and the health of beneficiaries.

Many Germans and Swedes now recognize \u2014 and some celebrate \u2014 the fact that their fellow citizens can have any skin color or religion. But the attempt to turn countries with monoethnic identities into truly multiethnic nations is a historically unique experiment, and so it should hardly come as a surprise that it has encountered some fierce resistance.\n\nThe situation in Canada and the United States, despite their histories as countries of immigration, has important similarities to that in Europe. Both have historically had rigid racial hierarchies. And in recent decades, both have made real steps toward overcoming these injustices: African-Americans, for example, are better represented in business and government than at any previous point in American history. This has made opposition to a more equal, multiethnic society more fervid among those who feel their privileges threatened. There is a sizable number of Americans for whom the idea of the nation remains synonymous with whiteness and Christianity.\n\nSo long as nationalism is associated with one particular ethnic or religious group, it will serve to exclude and disadvantage others. The only way to keep the destructive potential of nationalism in check is to fight for a society in which collective identity transcends ethnic and religious boundaries \u2014 one in which citizens from all religious or ethnic backgrounds are treated with the same respect as citizens from the majority group.\n\nTo effect this transformation is one of the great political challenges of our age. It requires principled resistance to right-wing nationalism, but it can succeed only if those who are most open to diversity abandon their hostility to other forms of nationalism.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nOne common reaction to the dangerous excesses of nationalism has been to forgo the need for any form of collective identity, exhorting people to transcend tribal allegiances completely. But for better or probably worse, it\u2019s easier to be moved by the suffering of people with whom we have some form of kinship. That is why nationalism remains one of the most powerful vehicles for expanding our circle of sympathy.\n\nAnother common reaction to the resurgence of nationalism has been to celebrate more narrow forms of collective identity, such as race or religion. At a time when many minority groups are under attack, it is, of course, crucial to defend them against discrimination. But it is also important to remember that such groups, too, are capable of oppressing their own members, for example by enforcing restrictive moral codes. That\u2019s why the only way to allow individuals true freedom to lead their lives is to preserve some form of political identity independent of the interests of particular cultural groups.\n\nConvinced that they would be unable to redirect nationalism toward their own ends, many of the most open-minded segments of society long ago gave up on the fight to determine its meaning. In countries like Germany and the United States, advocacy for the victims of prejudice has increasingly bled into a belief that the dark chapters of those countries\u2019 history make any form of nationalism deeply suspect. Instead of exhorting their fellow citizens to live up to their nations\u2019 highest ideals, many activists seem content with denouncing past and present injustices. This has allowed the bigots and racists to bend the meaning of the nation to their own sinister ends.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s time to fight back. Nationalism can, and should, be reclaimed for liberals.\n\nA few political leaders have made a valiant start. Barack Obama has been an especially persuasive advocate of the idea that Americans should focus on what unites rather than what divides us and that the symbolism of the nation can inspire hope, even as we reckon with the injustices of American history. \u201cWhat greater expression of faith in the American experiment than this,\u201d Mr. Obama marveled as he stood on the spot in Selma, Ala. where civil rights protesters were beaten in 1965. \u201cWhat greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished, that we are strong enough to be self-critical, that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is in our power to remake this nation to more closely align with our highest ideals?\u201d\n\nCampaigning for France\u2019s presidency last year, Emmanuel Macron expressed inclusive patriotism in an even more explicit form. \u201cI see Armenians, Italians, Algerians, Moroccans, Tunisians,\u201d he said at a rally in Marseille, a diverse city in southern France, \u201cBut what do I see? I see the people of Marseille! What do I see? I see the people of France!\u201d This, he added in an explicit repudiation of the exclusive nationalism propagated by the far-right National Front party, \u201cis what it means to be proud to be French!\u201d\n\nAmerican \u2014 and to a lesser degree European \u2014 political culture is pregnant with the symbols of inclusive patriotism. But while we have plenty of history to build on, we must also recognize that we are fighting to establish a kind of society for which there is no clear precedent.\n\nIn the United States, the model had once been a melting pot. But asking individuals to conform to one unified culture puts the price of admission to the nation too high. In Canada, the model is often said to be that of a salad bowl, in which the overall dish is enriched by the great variety of individual ingredients. But we can now see that this may be an overly idealized image of a society in which people feel that they have little in common across ethnic and religious divides.\n\nThere may not be a perfect culinary metaphor for the kind of country inclusive nationalists seek to create. But its contours should be obvious. It is a state in which all members have the same rights and opportunities irrespective of the group into which they are born or the culture to which they belong. It is a society in which people feel that they have something important in common because they seek to govern themselves together, pledge to help one another in an hour of need and recognize that these shared commitments are ultimately more consequential than any difference of color or creed. And it is a culture that does not shy away from celebrating the nobility of this collective identity \u2014 embracing the nation\u2019s flag not because we claim never to have failed our compatriots in the past but because we aspire to realize a common future fair to all.\n\nIt would be tempting to say that this kind of patriotism has little in common with the nationalism that is now ascendant around the world. Patriotism, some philosophers argue, should be understood as an innocent love of country that is inclusive at home and cooperative abroad. Nationalism, by contrast, excludes other ethnicities and stands in competition with the interests of other countries.\n\nBut it is too clever by half to pretend that we can safely stoke the good aspects of patriotism without ever running the danger of exacerbating the worst aspects of nationalism. For the kind of patriotism I am proposing is not a completely different form of collective identity; it is, rather, one that proudly stands in competition with the exclusionary politics on display from Washington to Moscow to Beijing.\n\nNationalism is like a half-wild beast. As long as it remains under our control, it can be of tremendous use. But if we abandon it, others are sure to step in, prodding and baiting the beast to bring out its most ferocious side. For all the well-founded misgivings about it, we have little choice but to domesticate it as best we can.", "keywords": ["liberals", "identity", "society", "religious", "form", "common", "political", "patriotism", "collective", "reclaim", "nation", "nationalism"], "polarity": 0.14129125602529854, "subjectivity": 0.47932204517310895},

Mr. Xi accorded Mr. Trump a lavish state visit to Beijing last November that the president has enthused about ever since.\n\nLeaders of democracies, including America\u2019s allies in Europe and Asia, have abstained from criticizing Mr. Xi, concerned in part by retaliatory economic reprisals.

I was too young to fully understand this strange convergence of events.

Republicans hold 23 of the Senate\u2019s 40 seats (two are vacant), leaving Democrats with too few votes to block bills on their own. And though the map of State Senate districts was redrawn by court order in 2016 to make it more fair, only a few Republican senators represent competitive districts, where voting against gun control might hurt them in a general election.\n\nAs a result, Democrats managed to get just one amendment passed: adding 12 hours of required diversity training for participants in the program to arm teachers. That was meant to address black lawmakers\u2019 concerns that teachers with guns might discriminate against black students in deciding when to use them.\n\nSouth Florida is not like other areas\n\nStudents from the school in Parkland, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, sprang into political action after losing classmates and teachers in the Feb. 14 mass shooting. They traveled by the busload to Tallahassee, meeting with lawmakers, chanting in hallways and protesting on the steps of the State Capitol in favor of stricter gun laws.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

No Republican senator represents any part of the county; there was no chance of one of them breaking party ranks to side with student survivors from the district.\n\nThe only two Republican senators who did consistently vote with the Democrats on Saturday were Anitere Flores and Ren\u00e9 Garc\u00eda, representing neighboring Miami-Dade County. That is Florida\u2019s most populous and most urban county, where even Republican constituents tend to be less strident about gun rights than in the rest of the state.\n\nA third Republican senator, Tom Lee, from the Tampa Bay area, joined in efforts to scrap the statewide armed-teacher program, which he called needlessly divisive, noting that local sheriffs and school superintendents can already set up such programs where they are wanted.\n\nMidterm politics are at play\n\nGov. Rick Scott, a Republican, has maintained that he does not want to arm teachers. He is widely expected to run for a United States Senate seat this year, and knows he will have to appeal to voters beyond his own party in a race against the incumbent Democrat, Bill Nelson.\n\nBut the calculus is different for the speaker of the House, Richard Corcoran, a likely candidate for governor in a crowded Republican field. Mr. Corcoran would like to appeal to President Trump\u2019s voter base in his party\u2019s primary, and he has backed the armed-teacher program enthusiastically, calling it a \u201cgame changer.\u201d\n\nThe Senate president, Joe Negron, also a Republican, suggested a possible compromise on Friday, arming noninstructional school personnel rather than teachers. Mr. Scott did not respond last week when asked whether he would accept that.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne way or another, though, Mr. Scott has said he is determined to pass the gun package, which would also include significant funding for school safety and mental health measures, before the end of the annual legislative session, which is scheduled to wrap up on Friday.", "keywords": ["senate", "democrats", "scott", "popular", "proposals", "republican", "teachers", "school", "county", "law", "florida", "tough", "program", "gun", "state", "road"], "polarity": 0.06634896584896585, "subjectivity": 0.46027080327080316},
{"title": "\n                    New Y.A. Books by Women of Color Rewrite Old Cultural Scripts                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/books/review/ya-women-of-color-clayton-adeyemi.html", "text": "Now, more than anytime in recent history, we\u2019re hearing the triumphant roar of women of color as they break down longstanding barriers in art, film and literature. In young adult literature in particular, inventive, international stories told in newly empowered women\u2019s voices are claiming their rightful place at the table. Take these five new Y.A. books, ranging from fantasy to realistic fiction to memoir. In these authors\u2019 hands, non-Western sensibilities might reign in a vivid and original Yoruban religion-based world, or classical settings might be reinterpreted to create a universe in which beauty is not tied to race. A heartbreaking fictional front row seat to the Syrian refugee emergency is offset by a humorous true tale of growing up an Iranian-American immigrant without a green card. And a very modern romance proves that, despite divides both cultural and digital, love still wins. So do Y.A. readers, when it comes to seeing exhilaratingly new kinds of characters sharing space.\n\nIn Dhonielle Clayton\u2019s lavish fantasy THE BELLES (Freeform, $17.99; ages 14 to 17), a thing of beauty is only temporary. The decadent island society of Orl\u00e9ans is home to a select group of sisters born with the disconcerting ability to perform plastic surgery without the plastic. As \u201cdescendants of the goddess of beauty,\u201d the Belles have a fuzzily explained magical \u201carcana\u201d in their blood that allows them to temporarily change the physical appearance of the native Gris, who are cursed with gray skin and red eyes. After a childhood of training, the teenage Belles are introduced to upper-class society and tasked with transforming the hair, skin and bone structure of the race-fluid rich and royal. But when the rebellious Belle Camellia uncovers a plot by the truly vile Princess Sophia to enslave her and her sisters, she sows the seeds of a grass-roots revolution that is bound to blossom more fully in the inevitable sequel.\n\nPhoto\n\nClayton, a co-founder of the We Need Diverse Books organization, has created an opulent mash-up setting, which seems to be a cherry-picked combination of 18th-century France, Japan and the antebellum American South. If it never quite coalesces into a seamless cultural whole, readers seduced by the page-turning palace intrigue and the vivid food and clothing descriptions won\u2019t notice or care.\n\nMagic also lies dormant in the platelets of chosen teenagers in the Nigerian-American Tomi Adeyemi\u2019s debut, CHILDREN OF BLOOD AND BONE (Holt, $18.99; ages 12 and up). But these diviners are no debutantes. Born with snow white hair and deep brown skin in the imaginary country of Or\u00efsha, young diviners morph into mighty, magic-wielding maji, or magicians, at 13. For centuries they relied on their powers (which Adeyemi based on aspects of the religion of the Yoruban people of West Africa). All that ended when the nonmagical King Saran ordered the slaughter of all adult majis. But when a mysterious scroll falls into the hands of Amari, a defiant princess, and Z\u00e9lie, a tenacious diviner warrior, the two young women set out on a thrilling, death-defying journey to restore magic and take back the throne.\n\nPhoto\n\nBlack Girl Magic, indeed! It\u2019s no surprise that this epic trilogy opener has already been optioned for film. Full of cinematic action sequences (the most memorable of them set almost entirely underwater and employing an army of the dead) and creatures worthy of Star Wars (horse-size \u201clionaires\u201d have saber teeth and horns), it storms the boundaries of the imagination. Yet it also confronts the conscience. Adeyemi\u2019s brutally depicted war between the noble, lighter-skinned kosidans and the enslaved, darker-skinned majis poses thought-provoking questions about race, class and authority that hold up a warning mirror to our sharply divided society.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Tareq is a Syrian refugee whose perilous journey is narrated by the voice of Destiny, characterized as a kindly, prosaic entity. After Tareq\u2019s mother, grandmother and four of his siblings are killed by a bomb, he and his father flee to Turkey with his remaining sister, Susan. They hopscotch from Turkey to Greece, Serbia, Slovenia, Austria and finally to Germany, where he finds a fragile safety. Along the way he witnesses beheadings and drownings, but also experiences the kindness of aid workers like Alexia, an American student. Abawi, a foreign news correspondent, does an admirable job of showing the grim horror of refugee life. But her efforts are occasionally undermined by cartoonish villains (\u201cYou tink you will be saved? Who will save you? Captain America is not real, just movies\u201d) and by some of Destiny\u2019s well-meaning but obvious platitudes: \u201cWhen you truly love someone, their life means more to you than your own.\u201d These interruptions may pull readers out of the story, though perhaps that distance is necessary for adolescents trying to process something as bleak and overwhelming as the Syrian refugee crisis.\n\nPhoto\n\nOf course, once refugees finally arrive in their adopted country, new problems arise. Until she was 13, Sara Saedi, an Iranian-American television writer and the author of the memoir AMERICANIZED: Rebel Without a Green Card (Random House, $17.99, ages 12 and up), was cheerfully oblivious of her family\u2019s immigration status. After her older sister breaks the news that they are \u201cillegal,\u201d Saedi suffers through the usual teenage rites of passage at her Silicon Valley high school (unibrow management, pimple wars, pot smoking) with the added pressure of possible deportation hanging over her head. Saedi adroitly and humorously uses these universal pubescent ordeals to contextualize Iranian culture and the immigrant experience. A memory of being teased about her eyebrow in ninth grade expands into a discussion of beauty norms: When her mother praises her for being hairless, \u201cshe meant by Persian woman standards. I was still hairy by everyone else\u2019s standards.\u201d And she has the sobering realization that pot is a privilege American teenagers can enjoy, but not undocumented kids: \u201cIf I got caught, I\u2019d have a criminal record that could be grounds for deportation.\u201d Very funny but never flippant, Saedi mixes \u201990s pop culture references, adolescent angst and Iranian history into an intimate, informative narrative that thoroughly defies current divisive views on immigration.\n\nPhoto\n\nMary H.K. Choi\u2019s blushingly tender and piquant debut novel, EMERGENCY CONTACT (Simon & Schuster, $17.99; ages 14 and up), about two isolated, misfit college students from Austin who fall in love via text message explores our emotional rather than geographical divides. In \u201cEmergency Contact,\u201d a Korean-American would-be writer named Penny keeps everyone at a distance, the result of living with a single, oversharing mom she calls \u201cthe equivalent of \u2026 human glitter.\u201d But when she rescues Sam, a half-German, half-Polish student filmmaker, from the sidewalk during a panic attack, she becomes his \u201cemergency contact,\u201d and he hers. Their charged, initial banter on text soon develops into increasingly personal exchanges about art, death, unstable moms and pregnant ex-girlfriends. Yet their burgeoning bond keeps stalling out. Burned by past relationships and millennial-ly tethered to their devices, they struggle to connect romantically IRL. Sam \u201ccouldn\u2019t imagine the space Penny would take up in his life if she sprang out of his phone,\u201d and Penny admits \u201cSam was her phone and her phone was Sam.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nChoi, a culture correspondent for HBO\u2019s Vice News, inserts timely issues like sexual assault, cultural appropriation and even DACA into her characters\u2019 intimate conversations, but it is her examination of digital vs. F2F communication that feels the most immediate. Has digital communication become so ubiquitous, and interpersonal contact so arduous, that we\u2019d rather type than talk? Thankfully, no.

Six governments have competing claims over various features in the South China Sea. In recent years, Vietnam, in particular, has watched warily as China, through extensive reclamation, has transformed bits of rock and reef it controls into sprawling artificial islands that now double as military bases.\n\nIn 2017 alone, China built permanent facilities on reclaimed land that \u201caccount for about 72 acres, or 290,000 square meters, of new real estate,\u201d according to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative run by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\n\u201cHanoi\u2019s agreement to the aircraft carrier visit demonstrates Vietnam\u2019s anxiety about what China will do next in the South China Sea,\u201d said Murray Hiebert, senior associate of the Southeast Asia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThe U.S. is virtually the last man standing to which Hanoi can look for support in the South China Sea dispute.\u201d\n\nAlthough the United States is not a claimant in the maritime dispute, the Navy portrays its deployments in the South China Sea as important to ensuring maritime security and nurturing the conditions that have led to Asia\u2019s post-World War II economic expansion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a stable environment where you have the ability to actually foment economic growth,\u201d Admiral Fuller said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve helped create the environment that has allowed for the 70 years of growth.\u201d\n\nThe admiral declined to comment, however, on how China\u2019s island-building is changing regional dynamics.

Four years after the last Americans withdrew from Saigon, Vietnam fought a border war with China. Since then, Chinese and Vietnamese troops have skirmished over ownership of islets in the South China Sea.\n\n\u201cNo one trusts the Chinese,\u201d said Maj. Gen.

President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, who took power days before the tribunal ruling, has declined to push Beijing to honor it.\n\nInstead, he has cozied up to China and criticized the United States, a longtime ally. Beijing followed up with vows to invest billions of dollars in the Philippines.\n\nMr. Duterte\u2019s departure from previous Philippine policy leaves Hanoi as the only country with major claims on the South China Sea that continues to denounce Beijing\u2019s muscular actions.\n\nIn 2014, Beijing moved an oil-drilling rig into disputed waters not far from Danang.

In Texas, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee opened fire on a progressive candidate, Laura Moser, posting negative research to blunt her rise in fear that a victory by her in Tuesday\u2019s primary race could doom the party\u2019s bid for a suburban Houston district in November.\n\nBut the battle to define the party is playing out most vividly in overwhelmingly safe House districts around cities like Boston, Chicago and New York, where younger liberals, often women, people of color or both, are confronting men who are products of a clubhouse politics where fealty to the organization was paramount.\n\nAnd no lawmakers may be more vulnerable to the rising left than Mr. Lipinski and, in Massachusetts, Representative Michael E. Capuano, a far more liberal Democrat who is nevertheless confronting a restless electorate in his Boston-based district.\n\nMr. Lipinski, opposed to abortion and uneasy with gay rights, is locked in a bitter campaign with Ms. Newman, a former marketing consultant who has backing from powerful liberal groups like Naral Pro-Choice America and the Human Rights Campaign.\n\nMr. Capuano, who is serving his 20th year in Congress, is a down-the-line progressive, who has drawn no opposition so far from national liberal groups. But he has stirred a challenge from Ayanna Pressley, the first black woman elected to the Boston City Council. In a district once held by John F. Kennedy and Tip O\u2019Neill, where college campuses abound and minority communities now make up most of the population, Ms. Pressley argues that voters should demand an activist lawmaker who is more than a \u201creliable vote.\u201d\n\nMr. Lipinski was bequeathed his heavily Polish and Irish district in Chicago around Midway Airport and the South Side by his father, William Lipinski, a former ward boss and representative.

Guti\u00e9rrez and Jan Schakowsky of Illinois to oppose their colleague, a rebuke that has angered some moderate Democrats.\n\nPhoto\n\nRepresentative Kurt Schrader of Oregon, who leads the political arm of the centrist Blue Dog caucus, has complained to the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee about the intervention of Ms. Schakowsky and said he would seek a rule change so that members like her who have formal positions on the committee cannot oppose incumbents. \u201cThat\u2019s just wrong, and we\u2019re going to change that,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the Washington contretemps are just a stand-in for a much weightier debate about the future of the party.\n\nMr. Lipinski, who makes no apology for opposing the health law, has embraced donations from anti-abortion Republicans helping fund a \u201csuper PAC\u201d in his favor and says it is Ms. Newman\u2019s ardent support for abortion rights that is \u201cextreme\u201d for the district.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

When she stopped recently to rally phone-bankers, one volunteer wore a T-shirt demanding \u201cReparations Now,\u201d a reference to the movement by African-Americans to retrieve compensation for slavery.\n\nSpeaking to her supporters, Ms. Newman invoked her transgender daughter.\n\nOver a diner lunch, where her Mercedes stuck out in the parking lot, she said a victory over Mr. Lipinski this month would echo across the country.\n\n\u201cWe need to have more diversity across people of color, gender and types of folks,\u201d Ms. Newman said. \u201cWe can\u2019t have all millionaires, billionaires, businesspeople and doctors in Congress.\u201d\n\nUnions are divided: Ms. Newman has the support of the more diverse service workers and teachers while Mr. Lipinski retains the backing of the building trades.\n\nA similar gulf exists in Mr. Capuano\u2019s district.\n\nThough the primary race is not until September, Ms. Pressley\u2019s candidacy has already roiled the party in Massachusetts, a rigidly hierarchical and predominantly white organization that is closely intertwined with organized labor.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn an unusual show of deference to Ms. Pressley, two of the state\u2019s highest-profile Democrats, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Seth Moulton, said they would stay neutral rather than back their colleague in Congress. Setti Warren, a former mayor of Newton who is the leading Democratic candidate for governor, endorsed Ms. Pressley. Damali Vidot, a Pressley supporter who is the president of the City Council in Chelsea, said there had been private pressure on Democrats not to buck Mr. Capuano.\n\nBut Ms. Vidot said with a smile that she was undeterred. \u201cI\u2019m with the new energy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need someone that understands the struggles of families in different neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nMr. Capuano is expected to mobilize a powerful group of supporters on his side. He counts Boston\u2019s popular mayor, Martin J. Walsh, as an ally, and Mr. Walsh has signaled he will back Mr. Capuano with his political operation, according to three people briefed on his plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because Mr. Walsh has not yet issued an endorsement. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III, perhaps the state\u2019s best-known House Democrat, is behind Mr. Capuano.\n\nMr. Capuano, 66, is one of three Democratic members of Congress facing primary opponents in Massachusetts, and he appears to be the most endangered. In an interview, Mr. Capuano acknowledged that he faced a new kind of race in a \u201csignificantly different\u201d political environment, and said he was prepared to defend a record of assailing Mr. Trump that includes two votes in favor of impeachment.\n\n\u201cMy district is upset,\u201d Mr. Capuano said. \u201cThey don\u2019t like the Donald Trump agenda, and I\u2019ve been as vocal as I can be.\u201d\n\nMs. Pressley, 44, has moved aggressively to cast Mr. Capuano as a figure of the past. At an event shortly after she announced she would run, she delivered a thematic broadside against Mr. Capuano without ever mentioning his name, depicting him as a well-meaning but too-conventional politician.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t play small ball and hang our hats on good votes on bad bills that pass,\u201d Ms. Pressley declared, to cheers from a crowd of more than 200 in a purple-lit barroom.\n\nMs. Pressley said the district had \u201cchanged a great deal\u201d over the last two decades. \u201cThe only thing that hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d she jabbed, \u201cis its representation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven in some traditionally Capuano-friendly quarters, there is a recognition that Ms. Pressley represents a kind of challenge the congressman has not faced before. Harris Gruman, the executive director of the Service Employees International Union\u2019s state council in Massachusetts, praised Mr. Capuano as a \u201cvery active\u201d ally, but he noted his union\u2019s membership was \u201cpredominantly people of color and women\u201d and said its endorsement would probably be up for grabs.\n\n\u201cWe are in a special moment, too, historically, with Trump as president and a sense of racial and social injustice at a heightened level,\u201d he said.\n\nBack on the South Side of Chicago, Ms. Newman fit right in as she spoke to voters at the Jackalope Coffee and Tea House, a few blocks from the old bungalow of former Mayor Richard J. Daley.\n\nMr. Daley, the iron-fisted personification of 20th-century machine politics, would have found the array of MacBooks, ironic mustaches and turmeric ginger-pumpkin chais as fantastical as the mythical animal from which the cafe takes its name.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s certainly an old guard, but there\u2019s also a rising number of young people in the city and young people here,\u201d said John Briggs, 47, a history professor, who liked what he heard from Ms. Newman. \u201cThere\u2019s an alienation from the machine.\u201d", "keywords": ["weigh", "pressley", "democratic", "democrat", "means", "capuano", "mr", "trump", "lipinski", "voters", "ms", "newman", "rights", "primaries", "begin", "divided", "district"], "polarity": 0.12148555871212122, "subjectivity": 0.40050493777056273},

She takes comfort from local efforts like a project in Utica, N.Y., where Bosnian Muslim immigrants and local Unitarian Christians watched a Super Bowl together. She applauds aggressive racial integration programs like those run by the American military. She cites her own teaching experience in small seminars at Yale, where students from divergent backgrounds overcame disagreements to achieve mutual respect, sometimes even friendship.\n\nPhoto\n\nYet the scholar in Chua acknowledges that these individual experiences offer less of a social lesson than she would wish.\n\n\u201cStudies show that minimal or superficial exposure to out-group members can actually worsen group division. \u2026 Negative interactions with people from other groups also increase group hostility. So merely putting members of different groups in the same space is not enough and indeed can aggravate political tribalism.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Chua falls back on the very attitude to which she turned her sharply skeptical gaze at the beginning of the book: the conviction that the United States was, is and will remain an exceptional nation, different from all the others. In her introduction, Chua remarked that the United States as a supertribal entity indifferent to ethnicity and culture became at best a partial reality only a generation ago. By book\u2019s end, however, the battered ideal has been polished and refurbished.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Will we, telling ourselves \u2018These immigrants are different,\u2019 be the weak link, the first generation to fail? Will we forget who we are?\u201d That\u2019s inspiring, and even more so are the citations of Martin Luther King Jr., Lin-Manuel Miranda and Langston Hughes that finish the book.\n\nInspiring \u2014 but not wholly reassuring. A lot of the interest of \u201cPolitical Tribes\u201d comes from the strong sense it emanates of an author arguing with herself. Chua both condemns tribalism and respects its power. She insists that the United States alone of nations among the earth has often transcended it \u2014 and then presents impressive contrary evidence from the past and the present. Chua reckons with the many tribalisms of the American past: ethnic, religious and racial. She hopes for a future in which tribalism fades \u2014 even as she mercilessly details its accumulating strength.\n\nAs Chua notes, tribes can coalesce out of previously unrelated pieces. Immigrants to Europe from North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia \u2014 of different languages, ethnicities, folkways and religious practices \u2014 raised children who created for themselves a new identity as post-ethnic Muslims. ISIS, as Chua mordantly observes, is in its own way a melting pot, bringing together young men and women from across Europe, Asia and the Americas to fight for a new ideology. She quotes a New York Times article about young British girls lured to ISIS. For them, \u201cIslam is punk rock.\u201d\n\nTribes can be created by fission as well as by fusion. Chua suggests that in the United States, divisions that would once have been understood as class divides have been reinterpreted in our time as cultural, even when they are not ethnic. \u201cWhite Americans often hold their biggest disdain for other white Americans \u2014 the ones on the opposite side of the cultural divide.\u201d\n\nThese fast-evolving and ever-changing identities may look contingent from the outside. They feel overwhelmingly powerful to those inside. Chua repeatedly scolds American policymakers for underestimating the importance of ethnocultural identity in Vietnam in the 1960s, Venezuela in the 1990s and Afghanistan in the 2000s. Through her book pulses an evident worry that tribal claims are now overpowering national ones within the United States. If she cannot quite bring herself to make her own anxieties explicit \u2014 or figure out what if anything to do to address them \u2014 she is hardly alone.

Otto Kerner of Illinois.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson had established the commission to examine the disorders and violent protests in Detroit, Newark and well over 100 other American cities during the summer of 1967, and earlier. What it found was searing. \u201cWhat white Americans have never fully understood \u2013 but what the Negro can never forget \u2013 is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto,\u201d the commission concluded. \u201cWhite institutions created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it.\u201d\n\nMostly moderate and mostly white men, the members of the bipartisan panel carried the imprimatur of the political establishment. Their recommendations attracted widespread public debate. The paperback edition of the report sold over two million copies.\n\nOccupied by the Vietnam War and concerned about the legacy of his Great Society domestic agenda, Johnson distanced himself from the \u201ctwo societies\u201d warning. But the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Robert Kennedy strongly endorsed the commission\u2019s findings and recommendations before they were assassinated and before more protests erupted during that traumatic year of 1968.\n\nThe Kerner Commission recommended \u201cmassive and sustained\u201d investments in jobs and education to reduce poverty, inequality and racial injustice.

The overall poverty rate remains about the same today as it was 50 years ago; the total number of poor people has increased from over 25 million to well over 40 million, more than the population of California.\n\nMeanwhile, the rich have profited at the expense of most working Americans. Today, the top 1 percent receive 52 percent of all new income. Rich people are healthier and live longer. They get a better education, which produces greater gains in income. And their greater economic power translates into greater political power.\n\nFive Indicators America of the 1960s contrasted with the most recent available data.

I\u2019d love to jump right in and hear your aspirations for Prairie View. What do you hope to accomplish in your time as president? I assume you had many offers to lead other colleges. Why was Prairie View different?\n\nRuth Simmons: Well, I\u2019m a native of Texas, and one of the things that I did when I returned to Houston after I retired from Brown was think about the ways I could use my experience to help the community. I started with small ventures in the city, but I hadn\u2019t thought really that another university would be in my life. But when I was approached by Prairie View, I thought immediately about its significant impact on my brother, who went there.

The transition that Dillard enabled for me was extremely valuable. As an undergraduate, I began to grow a sense of confidence that helped me move from a fairly insular environment to a bigger stage when I went to graduate school.\n\nMy aspirations for Prairie View are to essentially make sure the university is continuing to do the same thing for students today that it did for my brother \u2014 and Dillard did for me. And that is to offer the advantage of a strong education that will prepare students for the careers they want, in a social and cultural context that helps them develop the confidence to perform after graduation.\n\nAs president, that means focusing on time-honored strategies to success that apply to universities everywhere: worrying about the faculty who are recruited here, the campus experience, and whether we are providing the leadership and internship opportunities that students need. It means worrying about the reputation of the university. It\u2019s obviously a much more competitive world today than it was when I was a student, but the underlying work to move the university to a level of achievement that makes students and alumni proud is the same.\n\nM.J.: What do you see as some of the major challenges facing historically black colleges and universities?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: The general challenge for H.B.C.U.s is not unlike the problem many universities face today, and that is the financial model. Being tuition dependent has become a large problem for all universities. H.B.C.U.s are dependent on raising money, but that is a reality that most universities obviously face. So it very much depends on the question of whether the schools have a good-enough foundation because of secure financing. When it comes to the federal government\u2019s role in supporting H.B.C.U.s, I think we don\u2019t yet understand the extent to which they will be affected by the changes in Washington today. To say that many are not hopeful in this moment is an understatement. We just don\u2019t know.\n\nFrankly, that\u2019s why I advocate for developing enough financial independence to secure the future of our institutions. That means looking for different revenue streams, looking to increase our ability to raise funds and finding alternate programs that help to bring more income into our university. The only strategy cannot be to persistently raise tuition, making college outside the reach of many families.\n\nM.J.: You\u2019ve led several institutions that are all very different from each other, and the topic of leadership is something you\u2019ve talked a lot about. In another interview with The Times you said that it\u2019s much easier to lead people \u201cif you convey the underlying principles.\u201d Can you elaborate?\n\nR.S.: One thing that I\u2019ve learned is that the perceptions of what it takes to be a leader are often based on prototypical models that don\u2019t have much truth in reality. People look at the institutions that I have led and they see dissimilarities. I see similarities. When people think in terms of leadership, they\u2019re often thinking about the kind of specific skills needed for different types of enterprises. I think of leadership as more of a disposition \u2014 the ability to step into a situation to learn about the history of the enterprise, the opportunities that it faces, the culture that exists and the people who are served by it. To look at all of that, to listen to stakeholders and then to think about how that enterprise or institution should best be served. There is no one model of leadership if you approach it that way. What I have tried to do wherever I go is to start where the institution is rather than try to import particularly rigid constructs from other places. In that sense, I think a leader is more than anything else a facilitator. A person who is able to come in to show a community a picture of what it is, to provide some insight into what it could be \u2014 how it could be different or improved perhaps \u2014 and then enlist the help of people who are there and others who support that institution in order to move forward together.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nI don\u2019t subscribe to the model of hero leadership, which is identifying somebody who can come in and have magical powers and then wield the wand and fix things that have not been fixable before. I don\u2019t see that. I think leadership is a community affair.\n\nM.J.: That makes sense. So how do you approach educating the current generation of students at Prairie View to lead in the way you described?\n\nR.S.: People today are fond of leadership programs that theorize about the profile and tenets of leadership. And students anxiously get involved in those programs. I rather think that our entire campuses are incubators of leadership even without the formality of such programs because if we\u2019re doing what we should be doing, we are acclimating students to an environment in which they have to learn to work with others who are very different from themselves. And that seems to me to be the first requirement of leadership. To actually learn to work with people in a respectful and inclusive way is inordinately important. A campus provides one of the best opportunities for people to be able to do that because you sit in class alongside people whom you initially don\u2019t know. You are discussing your ideas, having people respond to them and often rejecting what you\u2019re saying. You are joining organizations that have certain aims that are being advanced by the collective, so you\u2019re learning how to facilitate. You are asked to step into leadership roles either through student government or organizations. Even in the classroom context you might play a leadership role. You have to learn to express yourself, to be convincing, to write out your ideas, to be more thoughtful than you\u2019d ordinarily be. All of those things are components of leadership.\n\nM.J.: Some would argue that social media, or perhaps disagreements over the concept of safe spaces, have made it more challenging for people to come together and to work together.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: Yeah, I would say that people frequently say that, but that has certainly not been my experience. I would say that in my days as a student, the tensions were higher, the disagreements were greater, the separation among us was certainly more pronounced. And people are kind of inventing a new narrative, that things are so much worse today than they were in the past. I don\u2019t buy that. I think we have new terminology, because the modern sciences of psychology and sociology and so forth and modern media have enabled us to peer into areas that we were not able to see as easily as before. And so when you have social media and all of the ways in which people can now say whatever they want to say \u2014 in an unartful or offensive way \u2014 that turns the volume up to be sure. But it doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t there before.\n\nI would say that the current situation ought to give us much more practice in how to engage with each other because it is not underground. It\u2019s out front, it\u2019s in the open. The media today and the things that are being reported should be upsetting or troubling to students, my goodness. But it may be an even better opportunity to engage students.\n\nAs a teacher, as an educator, I would say these times are especially fertile for teaching the skills that are needed in a world in which there are many types of people, many perspectives and so forth. Students don\u2019t need to feel silenced by the current situation. When students at Brown came to me and said, you know, they were hurt because somebody asked them about their hair, and they were tired of that and they didn\u2019t want any part of it, I would say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s just too bad!\u201d Somebody asked you about your hair, tell them about your hair. You are in college not to hide from that. You\u2019re there to teach the world about yourself, you\u2019re there to learn about others and to teach them about who you are. So I\u2019d rather think this whole notion of protecting people from that is something that we have to take in hand and deal with. And help students see the opportunity in that because if they engage with people who have those kinds of perspectives, they are going to be much stronger in the end than if they run away.\n\nM.J.: Do you see the situation differently for students at H.B.C.U.s? You mentioned that Dillard gave you the space to learn and build confidence before heading to graduate school.\n\nR.S.: There is a narrative that many people have for H.B.C.U.s. People see them as a monolith, or only see them as filling a gap that exists for African-Americans. H.B.C.U.s are not a brand. They are institutions with a certain history \u2014 they were originally set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for education \u2014 but they are not all alike, and are very diverse in what they offer.\n\nPrairie View, for example, is the second-oldest public institution of higher education in the state of Texas. It was set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for ex-slaves and whites. For a long time it provided educational opportunities for black students that wouldn\u2019t have been open to them otherwise. In nursing, architecture, engineering and other STEM fields at a time when many blacks were not able to go into those areas, the university was able to facilitate the entry of blacks into those professions.\n\nM.J.: Yes, this is something that Nikole Hannah-Jones has written about for The New York Times Magazine, in particular how Xavier University of Louisiana sends more black students to medical school than almost any other college in the country. I read that Prairie View has many more students who graduate with degrees in architecture and engineering.\n\nR.S.: Yes, going to Dillard is not like going to Prairie View. So the student who chooses to go to one H.B.C.U. may not find another appealing. That has to do with the unique features of the place, the academic culture and so on, the traditions. All of that makes a big difference.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen I went off to college, I was just trying to find a place where I could be a student without impediments that in that day and time were fairly widely known to be substantial if you enrolled in a majority-white institution. There was no question that in 1963, if you went off to college in the South, you had to be very careful about where you studied. The racial dynamic was very challenging at that time. One of the things I\u2019m learning now is that many of the students I speak to at Prairie View today have the same kinds of thoughts that I had those many years ago. They ask themselves, where can I feel comfortable so that I don\u2019t have to worry about anything but my academic work? So certainly that plays a factor in why students apply to H.B.C.U.s. And for some H.B.C.U.s, applications are way up. But if you reach the point where you think that a category of institutions are the right choice for you \u2014 going to an H.B.C.U. just to go to an H.B.C.U. \u2014 then you\u2019re not thinking broadly enough.\n\nM.J.: As you look across the landscape of higher education, what other challenges do college students face today?\n\nR.S.: I guess I worry a lot about our students having the skills and the experience to promote respectful interactions with a wide-ranging group of people. Students can be quite passionate about what they see on the national scene and how sometimes dangerous they think it is \u2014 how unpleasant it is and so forth. But we\u2019ve got to try to find a way on our campuses not to taint the national picture as hopeless, or as being antithetical to anything that we can think of as good and admirable. The last thing we want is for our students to bow out and decide that it isn\u2019t worth trying to do anything about a hopeless situation.\n\nAnd I do think that civility goes hand in hand with being hopeful. Hopeful that the next person you meet you will be able to converse with you in a respectful way. Hopeful that the next election cycle is going to give you a chance to be engaged and able to do something that makes you feel a sense of your own agency. Hopeful that the things will get better rather than worse.\n\nSo much of what we have to do on our campuses is really to hold open the possibility for people that civil society will in the end right itself \u2014 if enough of us are engaged. I am so thankful every day for the fact that I grew up in a time when nobody thought blacks would be able to be integrated into American society, they would never be able to hold important positions, they\u2019d never be respected intellectually, they\u2019d never be able to do the things that they are now able to do. So why did we persist? And why did we continue to work toward betterment? We did it because we had people working with us in education who were ever hopeful that things were going to change. So I like to say to educators, you have to be always projecting to students that civility enables hopefulness to be ever resurgent.", "keywords": ["view", "say", "ruth", "prairie", "think", "leadership", "generation", "cultivating", "college", "today", "simmons", "things", "dont", "able", "students"], "polarity": 0.18839701321015756, "subjectivity": 0.47766767453623127},

They are quiet, almost too much so. But once you learn what happened in these scenes from small towns, big cities or verdant fields, their almost unemotional first impression gives way to horror: Someone was lynched there.\n\nStarting in 2016, Mr. Clasper traveled through the United States seeking the sites of lynchings. He wanted to show how places that call no attention to themselves were the sites of hangings, slashings or execution by gunfire. In the course of covering 24 sites, they span 150 years, right up to the present century, and range from the American south to New York City.\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective, I take it back to 1903, when the American scholar and activist W.E.B. Du Bois said the problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line,\u201d Mr. Clasper said. \u201cIt seems to me not a lot has changed despite significant advances. There has been barely a year or generation that has passed where racism and violence have not been at the forefront of the American experience.\u201d\n\nAs the London-born son of a British mother and American father, Mr. Clasper said he had \u201ca deep spiritual connection to the American landscape.\u201d In this series \u2014 titled \u201cThe Spaces We Inherit\u201d \u2014 he hopes to gently confront viewers in a way that eschews graphic images of violence.\n\n\u201cI took a different approach and focused on the spaces to encourage people to look at this history from an altered perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve become desensitized to images of violence. But everything that happen s has to happen somewhere.\u201d\n\nGiven the persisting tensions over racial and religious prejudice, Mr. Clasper wants to gently provoke a necessary conversation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to investigate these deep-seated issues in America,\u201d he said. \u201cI think many agree that the nation has not dealt with its bloody past of lynchings and segregation. It seemed to me there has been no collective acceptance, let alone recognition of the mistakes made and the sins committed.\u201d\n\nInterviews were conducted by Oliver Clasper and have been edited for brevity.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Jesse Lee Bond, Arlington, Tenn., 1939\n\nOn April 28, 1939, a local sharecropper named Jesse Lee Bond was shot to death in broad daylight by employees of SY Wilson, a local hardware store. Jesse Lee Bond had asked for an invoice the day before after purchasing goods on credit, something that was no\u0095t done by African-Americans at that time as keeping sharecroppers in the dark about how much they had spent was one way for white owners to keep their workers in constant debt. The day of Jesse Lee Bond\u2019s murder he was ordered back to the store. His aunt accompanied him and witnessed the whole thing. \u201cThey shot at him and shot him. He ran out to the outhouse. They riddled the outhouse. And when he staggered out of the outhouse, they threw him down, castrated him, and dragged him to the river,\u0095\u201d she said. The family was told he had drowned accidentally.\n\nImage\n\nSylvester Lewis, Memphis\n\n\u201cI remember my cousin Jesse well. I was 9 when he was killed and he was 20. What I heard was that there had been a dispute at the SY Wilson general store over in Arlington. Jesse insisted on a receipt, but this is something they didn\u2019\u0095t do. I think whoever he was negotiating with relented, but I think the people over him, the father of the individual in question, didn\u2019\u0095t like it. They went to his home and said they wanted to talk to him and ordered him back to the store. When he returned they attacked him. He tried to run for his life but they caught up with him and shot him. I also heard that they dragged his body behind a vehicle and then dumped him in the river. The descendants are running the store now, and I\u2019\u0095m not sure they know what happened. The ones who were allegedly involved in the lynching passed a long time ago, but their relations are still in Arlington. I don\u2019t think there\u2019\u0095s any resentment now. Anyone who hears about it can\u2019\u0095t understand how that could happen. They simply can\u2019t relate to that kind of criminal activity.\u201d\n\nInterviewed November 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Emmett Till, Drew, Miss., 1955.\n\nIn what is one of the most significant race-related events in the history of the United States, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Chicago native, was brutally lynched in rural Mississippi on Aug. 28, 1955. Till, who had been visiting family members in the area, entered a local white-owned grocery store in the town of Money for less than one minute. Whatever was said between him and the proprietor, Carolyn Bryant, was used as the pretext for his murder. Four days later Till was abducted from his uncle\u2019\u0095s house by Roy Bryant, Carolyn\u2019\u0095s husband, and J.W. Milam and driven to a nearby barn where he was severely beaten and tortured (the original wall of the barn can be seen on the left of the photograph). He was then taken to the Tallahatchie River, shot in the head, and drowned with a cotton gin fan tied around his neck. In an infamous court case both defendants were found \u0094not guilty\u0095 by an all-white jury. Months later they sold their story and admitted their guilt, with Bryant claiming that the Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education that desegregated schools was a mistake. Emmett Till\u2019s mother, Mamie Till Bradley, allowed photos to be taken of her son\u2019s broken and swollen body because she \u201cwanted the world to see what they did to my baby.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nDr. Jeffrey Andrews, Drew, Miss.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know the history of the property when I purchased it in 2003 and it was only two years later that a few local people told me of the Emmett Till murder. I\u2019ve lived in Drew since I was 12 and I had never heard of it. I\u2019ve since modified the barn to make it more functional and useful, and someone once asked me why I would change a historical site, but history is in the past and people should move on. Things have changed drastically here in the Mississippi Delta region and race relations are at all-time high. History is an important learning tool and it should be used to help people move forward, but one thing you have to remember is that people here don\u2019t want to be constantly reminded of how things were 60 years ago. We\u2019ve all moved forward, and sometimes people aren\u2019t given enough credit for the changes we\u2019ve made. I respect everyone\u2019s feelings towards Emmett Till, and I\u2019ve met some of his family members. They\u2019re great people. This has been a learning experience for my family and we appreciate the fact that we\u2019re part of a historical site.\u201d\n\nInterviewed March 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Joe Coe, Omaha, 1891\n\nOn Oct. 10, 1891, a 50-year-old African-American named Joe Coe (also known as George Smith) was accused of sexually assaulting a 5-year-old girl and was quickly arrested. Rumors spread that the girl had died and that Coe would get off lightly, neither of which was true. A frenzied mob seized him from the jail at the Douglas County Courthouse, put a rope around his neck, and dragged his body through the streets. Coe was then hanged from a streetcar wire on the corner of 17th and Harney in front of thousands of onlookers. Souvenirs of the rope were later sold. Mayor Richard C. Cushing of Omaha condemned the lynching as \u201c\u0094the most deplorable thing that has ever happened in the history of the country.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Ell Persons, Memphis, 1917\n\nWhen the decapitated body of a 16-year-old local, Antoinette Rappel, was found near the old Wolf River Bridge in May 1917, Ell Persons, a local black woodcutter, was deemed a possible suspect. Despite being arrested and released twice, he was captured a third time and forced to confess. A local mob announced that he was to be lynched the next day. The news spread, and a crowd of 3,000 turned up to witness his lynching (including students of Central High School). Ell Persons was burned on a makeshift pyre in a carnival-like atmosphere. He was then decapitated, and his head was taken to the predominantly African-American Beale Street and thrown at locals. A century later his lynching was commemorated and a historic marker was erected near the site.\n\nImage\n\nAmal Altareb, Memphis\n\n\u201cI came to America in 2012 from Yemen. I\u2019m still learning the language and the history, and it wasn\u2019t until the spring of last year that I learned about lynchings. I knew some of the history of segregation and Jim Crow laws, and I knew how unfair the system was \u2014 that African-Americans weren\u2019t treated as equals \u2014 but I didn\u2019t know that human beings had been burned or hanged from a tree just because of their race. Last year my class at Central High School were discussing it and I asked what lynchings were and they were surprised that I didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s surprising that humans can go so far as to kill someone else in this way and create a festival-like atmosphere. There were even spectators. Uncovering the truth is painful, but it\u2019s important. The African-American students especially don\u2019t talk about it because it\u2019s painful, and it reminds them of the injustices towards their race. White Americans don\u2019t want to remember either because of the guilt they feel. I can understand why people want to avoid the topic, but we need to face history in order to move forward.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Leo Frank, Marietta, Ga., 1915\n\nMary Phagan, 13, was found dead on April 26, 1913, at a National Pencil Company factory where she worked. Amid an atmosphere of anti-Semitism and despite conflicting evidence, a Jewish superintendent named Leo Frank was convicted of the crime. Frank\u2019s sentence was later commuted from the death penalty to life imprisonment, a decision that led a mob on Aug. 17, 1915, to seize him from state prison and lynch him from a tree in Marietta, Mary Phagan\u2019s hometown. Later that year the second chapter of the Ku Klux Klan was founded on Stone Mountain, with a number of Leo Frank\u2019s murderers present. Leo Frank was posthumously pardoned in 1986.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of George W. Murray, Mae Murray Dorsey, Roger Malcom and Dorothy Malcolm, Walton County, Georgia, 1946\n\nAfter Roger Malcom, a World War II veteran and Georgia sharecropper, had been bailed out of jail after allegedly stabbing a white man, members of the local community decided to take revenge. On July 25, 1946, a mob of 15 to 20 stopped the car Malcom was riding in with his wife, Dorothy, and another couple, George W. Murray and Mae Murray Dorsey, who was pregnant. They tied the four of them to a nearby tree and shot them to death. Mae Murray Dorsey then had her unborn baby ripped out of her. Despite an F.B.I. investigation nobody was brought to trial for the crime, and a few months later a grand jury was \u201cunable to establish the identity of any persons guilty of violating the civil rights statute of the United States.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nCeleste Butler, Omaha\n\n\u201cTracing one\u2019s roots and one\u2019s history is hard, especially as an African-American. These are big questions we all want to know: Who are we and where do we come from? I had DNA testing done recently but it didn\u2019t lead anywhere. It just told me that my ancestors came from West Africa, but it couldn\u2019t say where exactly. Missing that part and not being able to hand it down to my children or grandchildren is frustrating. On top of that you hear some people in this country telling black people to \u2018go back home.\u2019 Home to what? Home to whom? It feels like a total assault both mentally and physically to have chapters and generations missing. Not being able to fill that void is difficult. When it comes to racial violence I feel like we\u2019re constantly suffering from PTSD. It\u2019s a stress that never really goes away. A lot of people suffer in pain and in silence, and they suffer for successive generations. Everything was stripped from us, and we\u2019ve been struggling to put the pieces back together ever since.\u201d\n\nInterviewed September 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Michael Donald, Mobile, Ala., 1981\n\nMichael Donald, 19, was abducted on March 21, 1981, by Henry Hays and James Knowles as he was walking home. They beat him, slit his throat, and hanged his body from a tree outside 114 Herndon Avenue. The pretext for Donald\u2019s murder was a \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict handed down by a partially black jury to an African-American man accused of killing a white police officer. This incensed the Alabama chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, led by Benny Jack Hays, the father of Henry Hays, who suggested killing a random black person in response. Michael Donald\u2019s mother, Beulah Mae Donald, with the help of the Southern Poverty Law Center, brought a case not just against the killers but also the United Klans of America. Beulah Mae Donald won the case and received $7 million in damages, essentially bankrupting the U.K.A. Henry Hays was executed, while Knowles received life imprisonment. Hays is the only known Klan member to have been executed in the 20th century for the murder of an African-American. Herndon Avenue has since been renamed Michael Donald Avenue and a historic marker has been erected.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Mulugeta Seraw, Portland, Ore., 1988\n\nOn the evening of Nov. 13, 1988, an Ethiopian student named Mulugeta Seraw was being dropped off at his apartment when he was attacked by Kenneth Mieske, Kyle Brewster and Steve Strasser, members of a local racist skinhead group called East Side White Pride. Mieske delivered the fatal blows with a baseball bat. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 1990 Seraw\u2019s family, represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, brought a civil lawsuit against the killers\u2019 affiliated group, the White Aryan Nation, and its leaders, Tom and John Metzger, for $12.5 million. Tom Metzger later said that the killers had done their \u201ccivic duty\u201d by killing Seraw.\n\nImage\n\nJason Downard, Portland, Ore.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 2 I was put into foster care, and in 2009 I went to prison for a gang-affiliated drive-by shooting. I didn\u2019t grow up racist, but in prison the racist skinheads pulled me into their group and drilled stuff into my head about how the media is run by Jews and that they wanted an all-white nation. I also got a tattoo of a swastika on my leg, which I\u2019ve since had covered up. It\u2019s a painful reminder. The skinheads showed me support and love and compassion, which I hadn\u2019t experienced before in my life; everyone is looking for some kind of acceptance. I was angry and uncomfortable with who I was, and I drove that anger towards people who didn\u2019t look like me. In the last two years of the movement my sister had a son with a black guy and my nephew would give me this look like he knew what I was about. I started to get a guilty conscience and began to think about the things I thought I believed in. My sister said I\u2019d been brainwashed, and I can see why. The movement just taught me to hate and reinforced those views. The problem of racism in this country is much deeper than many people think. When it comes to Trump, he\u2019s tacitly endorsed the alt-right and white supremacists. It\u2019s been a ripple effect and things have gotten worse since he came into power. The right now feel emboldened. I look back now at some of the things I\u2019ve done and I realize that I\u2019ve hurt a lot of people.

The reason, he later told police, was his hatred of interracial relationships. Three days later he found Timothy Caughman, 66, collecting cans in a trash bin on the corner of West 36th and 9th Avenue and stabbed him multiple times with an 18-inch sword. Caughman died of his injuries that night, and two days later Jackson turned himself in, telling police that he had planned to kill more black men in Times Square. On March 27, Jackson was charged with one count each of murder in the first and second degrees as an act of terrorism, second-degree murder as a hate crime, and three counts of criminal possession of a weapon.\n\n\u201cThe Spaces We Inherit,\u201d which will be published as a book by Overlapse in October 2018, is available for pre-order.\n\nFollow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

Though his inquiry is intensely, at times painfully personal, Mr. Wilkerson is above all concerned with unpacking the mechanisms of racial domination. The procedure is akin to performing surgery on a half-conscious subject, or digging up a buried land mine that has lost little of its explosive power.\n\nVideo\n\nThe focus of his excavation is a killing that took place in Dothan, Ala., in 1946, when S.E. Branch, a white shopkeeper, shot Bill Spann, a black man who was in his store. Branch, Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s great-grandfather, was charged with first-degree murder, but no trial was ever held, and the crime faded from memory. Or rather, the memory of it was quietly and systematically suppressed. All that remains are a short newspaper article and a few photographs and home movies of the killer.\n\n\u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d proceeds on several parallel tracks. Mr. Wilkerson returns to Alabama and tries to discover both how Bill Spann died and how he was forgotten. His investigation, accompanied by haunting images of Southern back roads and quiet houses, is punctuated by reminders that Bill Spann\u2019s death is hardly a unique or anomalous event. The names of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and other recent victims of racist violence appear onscreen, and two songs of protest loop into the soundtrack: Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s \u201cHell You Talmbout\u201d and Phil Ochs\u2019s \u201cWilliam Moore.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat song, about a white postal worker and civil rights activist murdered on an Alabama highway in 1963, is the source of the film\u2019s title and a part of its wider cultural context. \u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d is a passionately political film, aflame with rage in spite of its director\u2019s measured, ruminative tone of voice. It is also a horror movie, full of specters and silences and a terror that is pervasive, intimate and elusive.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Wilkerson, whose previous films include \u201cAn Injury to One\u201d and \u201cFar From Afghanistan,\u201d dispenses with many of the usual techniques of historical documentary. There are a few on-camera interviews, with neighbors and relatives, but more frequently Mr. Wilkerson narrates encounters that took place off camera. And his sleuthing often leads not to moments of revelation but to dead ends and deeper mysteries. The insertion of clips from \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d provides a chilling and ironic counterpoint to the grim story this movie is telling. S.E. Branch is the opposite of Gregory Peck\u2019s brave and decent Atticus Finch, and the truth about what happened to Bill Spann resists the kind of redemptive, healing conclusion that remains a cornerstone of American racial fantasy.\n\nInstead of consolation, Mr. Wilkerson offers commitment. Instead of idealism, honesty. He doesn\u2019t suppose that his film will solve anything, but there is nonetheless something profoundly useful about the way he confronts past and present manifestations of white supremacy. He links his great-grandfather\u2019s crime to the contemporaneous gang rape of Recy Taylor (the subject of an excellent recent documentary by Nancy Buirski), and uncovers patterns of abuse within his family. He corresponds with a relative who is part of a white nationalist, \u201cSouthern secessionist\u201d group. He notes the way racial injustice dwells in apparently mundane facts. The killer is immortalized in pictures and a well-kept tombstone. His victim has been almost entirely erased from memory, a kind of second death beyond the reach of redress or revenge.", "keywords": ["bill", "supremacy", "wilkerson", "wonder", "mr", "memory", "spann", "racial", "review", "white", "reckons", "movie", "gun", "fired"], "polarity": 0.04540441176470589, "subjectivity": 0.3202205882352941},

People like to have labels for actors, and the truth is, every actor is a character actor. When I say actor, I mean actresses as well. Toni Collette is a good example of someone who can do both leading lady and transformational characters, where you\u2019re barely recognizing them.

I can relate to self-loathing. The reason a person lashes out the way Dixon does is because he hates himself, so anybody can relate to that. I\u2019m drawn to complex characters; they\u2019re all filled with so many different feelings, and that\u2019s what makes them interesting. The first \u201cIron Man,\u201d Tony Stark, was an interesting character. He drinks too much, he\u2019s a womanizer, and then he has this epiphany. That\u2019s what\u2019s interesting.\n\nWhat do you think it was about this role, and this film, that led to so many awards?\n\nIt\u2019s the transformational aspect of it, the fact that he was really many different roles wrapped up in one role. He\u2019s a doofus, he\u2019s a racist, he\u2019s violent, he\u2019s a mama\u2019s boy. There\u2019s a few heroic things at certain points. But he\u2019s very flawed, and it\u2019s a boy-to-man journey.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere\u2019s been criticism that your character got away scot-free for his racist behavior and for throwing a guy out the window, and never being brought to justice.\n\nIt\u2019s a small town and, who knows, in real life maybe he would have gotten thrown in prison. It\u2019s a sort of dark fairy tale in certain ways \u2014 it\u2019s not necessarily meant to be completely realistic. And if it is meant to be realistic, in real life, things aren\u2019t tied up in a bow. People who deserve to get punished don\u2019t necessarily get punished.\n\nDid it surprise you that there was criticism of the movie along these lines?\n\nNo, whenever a movie is popular and it is a complex dramatic story, I think it\u2019s going to stir up a lot of feelings. A lot of good stuff come out of it \u2014 the billboards that have been popping up [activists recreated versions of the billboards in Miami and London]. That\u2019s kind of incredible, when a movie can effect social change, that\u2019s kind of astounding. I think Mildred [the film\u2019s mother, played by Frances McDormand, who is seeking justice in the murder of her daughter] is a really beautiful working-class wonder woman in some ways. It\u2019s a kind of antihero slash protagonist thing that I think women really need right now. Mildred and [the directors] Greta Gerwig and Patty Jenkins. It\u2019s been an incredibly vibrant year.\n\nYou\u2019re a really good dancer \u2014 you can really bust a move. You did the splits on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d How did that come about? Is it self-taught?\n\nIt\u2019s a long story, but I hung out with a certain crowd, and it was a way to meet girls.\n\nWhat kind of certain crowd?\n\nSan Francisco is not all cable cars and Rice-A-Roni. There were some tough kids there. When I was in middle school, there was a more white supremacist kind of group I didn\u2019t get along with. I got in a lot of fights with them and didn\u2019t win a lot of those fights. I didn\u2019t get along with the rich kids, people we called WPODs: white punks on dope. My school was interracial, and I met a cool group of friends who introduced me to some other friends. I used to do really bad break dancing, when \u201cThriller\u201d and \u201cPurple Rain\u201d came out. I was into Run-DMC, Grandmaster Flash, Doug E. Fresh, Eric B. & Rakim. Probably my biggest inspiration was James Brown, and watching Tom Cruise in \u201cRisky Business.\u201d I remember practicing that, and watching James Brown do the splits. I [recently] did SoulCycle, I\u2019m not proud to say, and Usher was next to me. I thought I had rhythm until I was on a bicycle next to Usher. This is what happens when you go to spinning class in Hollywood.\n\nWere you intimidated working with Frances McDormand?\n\nI think it\u2019s the biggest compliment to Frances that people are asking, \u201cWere you intimidated by her?\u201d Not really, but I was nervous to get in the ring with a great actor. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of great actors. She\u2019s really a force. I think what\u2019s great about her is her integrity. Her sense of truth is like an iron bar. All these people \u2014 Woody [Harrelson, a co-star], Martin [McDonagh, the film\u2019s writer-director], Frances \u2014 are true anarchists, they really are. I think it comes through in their work. I\u2019m not exactly conventional either.\n\nSo your dad posted a comment on that New York Times essay criticizing the film \u2014 he defended you. Was it definitely your dad?\n\nYes that was my father. I didn\u2019t read the article, but they read that quote to me on the Jimmy Kimmel show. That was my dad being a supportive father.

While it may not be a common vantage point, the narrative is a natural one for Marilyn Stern, a photographer and graphic artist who is a member of the Metropolitan Postcard Club of New York City.\n\nNot surprisingly, the vast majority of postcards that feature black people in the United States from the 19th and 20th centuries were very racist, she said.\n\n\u201cI was so sick of seeing these horrible racist stereotypes,\u201d said Ms. Stern, a collector since the mid-1970s. \u201cWhenever I came across something that was not racist or not stereotypical, or even went so far as showing romance between the races, I wanted to save it and collect it.\u201d\n\nHer collection, which numbers about 3,000, has about 300 postcards that depict African-American life in all lights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for us to fathom how isolated people were, especially in rural areas and isolated small towns before there were telephones and radios,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were postal deliveries three times a day, so it was the internet of the early 1900s.\u201d\n\nPostcards had better printing technology than magazines and newspapers did at the time, as the burst of color in the selection below shows. They could show racism with clarity. \u201cThe idea that you could see images so realistic blew people away,\u201d she said.\n\nMany of the racist postcards were a form of propaganda, she said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to see how racism was manifested in the past,\u201d she said, \u201cperhaps to better fight it in the present. You can recognize something if you\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d\n\nBelow is a selection from Ms. Stern\u2019s collection with descriptions based on her research.\n\nTrade Cards\n\nImage\n\nAfrican-Americans were often subjects \u2014 and targets \u2014 of advertising cards that were issued before 1900. These cards were frequently given away in products, or with the purchase of a product.\n\nAbove, an advertisement for J & P Coats thread. Below, a country doctor dispensing Ayer\u2019s Cathartic Pills.\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk, a dance created by plantation slaves as a satire of Southern white society, was the focus of these cards, which featured two black children and an African-American troupe that toured Europe in the late 1800s and early 1900s.\n\nRacist Cards\n\nImage\n\nThe card on the left was shot in a professional studio, but it was labeled \u201cHer Country Cousins.\u201d The implication was that no matter how refined, educated or successful black Americans became, they were still basically savages, Ms. Stern said.\n\nThe two cards on the right were produced in 1905 in New York on the common theme of the delivery stork. The first one, with the caption \u201cComparing Notes,\u201d shows both a black baby and a white baby, with no apparent bias. The second one shows two black babies with the slogan \u201cNo Race Suicide,\u201d implying that a high black birthrate threatened white supremacy, she said.\n\n\u201cLovers of All Nations\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThis postcard was from a series mailed in 1908 that was called \u201cLovers of All Nations.\u201d The banjo was a racial stereotype, but the card is in the non-discriminating \u201cFamily of Man\u201d tradition.\n\nMemories of Slavery\n\nImage\n\nPostcards once served as documentary photography. Some cards honored older African-Americans of the South, who were living memories of slavery. This was part of a series, and it was mailed in 1906.\n\nLife in the Jim Crow South\n\nImage\n\nA fortuneteller with white clients, mailed in 1908.\n\nHoliday Greetings\n\nImage\n\nIdealized country life, in a card mailed in 1907, as Americans flocked to cities.\n\nReligion\n\nImage\n\nA card, likely from the early 1950s, urging parishioners to come to church.\n\nReal Photos\n\nImage\n\nAn unidentified young woman in her graduation cap and gown, in a studio portrait taken between the 1920s and \u201940s. Cards labeled \u201cReal Photo Postcards\u201d are set apart from commercially printed postcards and are actual photographs printed on photographic paper with a preprinted postcard back.\n\nAchievement\n\nImage\n\nThe many important contributions that African-Americans made to society were rarely acknowledged in older postcards, but an exception was made for the scientist and educator George Washington Carver.\n\nHis experiments with peanuts, sweet potatoes and other crops contributed greatly to the economy of the South. This card \u2014 from a photo shot on Kodachrome or Ektachrome film \u2014 is from the late 1950s to mid-60s.\n\nFor more, see Ms. Stern\u2019s postcard blog, and a review of the film Through a Lens Darkly that deals with African-American representation in postcards and photography.

Alex Bowman, 24, who replaced Earnhardt in the No. 88 car for Hendrick Motorsports, will start the Daytona 500 from the pole position.

A graduate of Nascar\u2019s Drive for Diversity program, Darrell Wallace Jr., 24, could give stock car racing something it has never had before: an African-American star.\n\nBut that is not why Richard Petty brought Wallace onto his team. Late last season, Wallace, who goes by the nickname Bubba, got four rides with Richard Petty Motorsports. It was enough for Petty, one of Nascar\u2019s most iconic names, to not only give Wallace a full-time ride, but also to give him his famed No. 43 racecar to drive. Wallace is the first African-American to drive full-time in the top Nascar series since Wendell Scott in 1971.\n\nPetty insisted, though, that he is colorblind when it comes to evaluating talent. Sure, it would be great if Wallace brings the sport into the African-American community, but as far as Petty is concerned, that\u2019s secondary.\n\n\u201cI hope he advances us as a race team,\u201d Petty said in an email. \u201cI care about what Bubba can do behind the wheel for us. The rest, there are a lot of eyes on Bubba, but he\u2019s handling it well. I know come Sunday he\u2019ll be ready to get into a racecar and just show his talent. If he does well, the rest will come and he\u2019ll grow our fan base.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThose eyes on Wallace, much as they were on Tiger Woods a generation ago, prompted Earnhardt to call him last week.

But there\u2019s also venturing out into a different market, into different avenues where the African-American culture lives. We all have to do better at that.\u201d\n\nThere are challenges, of course. On social media, where vulgar epithets can be spewed from faceless and fictitious monikers, Wallace has, at times, had to think twice before responding. He admits he has not always been successful.\n\n\u201cThere is always going to be haters out there, people who don\u2019t want to see you succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that since Day 1 from my parents. Just keep your head down and keep moving, that\u2019s the best you can do.\u201d\n\nBlaney, his closest friend on the circuit, has been around Wallace when offensive remarks have been made.\n\n\u201cThankfully, it\u2019s very, very rare, but it upsets me,\u201d Blaney said. \u201cBubba\u2019s great at handling it. He\u2019s an amazing ambassador for the sport. And he\u2019s really talented and a heck of a competitor. All of us are competitive, but his competitiveness is unlike anyone I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nNascar\u2019s diversity has become an issue again after its only female racer, Danica Patrick, announced she will retire from the circuit after the Daytona 500.

A native of Monterrey, Mexico, Su\u00e1rez said he had noticed an uptick in social media messages from a variety of Latino countries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually either people who tell me they\u2019re now following the sport because of me, or they\u2019ve been fans and now they have a driver to root for,\u201d said Su\u00e1rez, who is also a graduate of the Drive for Diversity program. \u201cThe potential is huge. This is the most diverse country in the world, but we have to improve diversity in Nascar. If we can make the sport more diverse, we\u2019ll see the same thing with fans.

After graduating from Lanier High School, he went to Morehouse College, the historically black institution in Atlanta, and was working on the student newspaper when it published some of the early writings of another Morehouse student, Martin Luther King Jr. Mr. Bennett graduated in 1949, the year after King did, and went to work at the black newspaper Atlanta Daily World.\n\nHe moved to Jet magazine in Chicago in 1953 as an associate editor and to Ebony, its sister publication, a year later. He became senior editor there in 1958 and later executive editor. He worked for the magazine into his 80s.\n\n\u201cBefore the Mayflower\u201d established Mr. Bennett as a leading scholarly voice during the racial ferment of the 1960s. In 1966 he testified before a House Education subcommittee looking into racism and unrest, and was blunt, tracing the turmoil of the times to an education system that did not prepare students to live in a multiracial society.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt is my opinion, and the opinion of many writers and scholars in this field,\u201d he said, \u201cthat segregated textbooks \u2014 and segregated and segregating use of words, symbols and ideas \u2014 are as dangerous to the internal peace of America as segregated schools and residential areas.\u201d\n\nThat was relatively mild compared with what he said about Abraham Lincoln in a January 1968 article in Ebony. Despite his reputation as an emancipator, Mr. Bennett wrote, Lincoln was actually a white supremacist who thought that the races would be better off separated, \u201cpreferably with the Atlantic Ocean or some other large, deep body of water between them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe man\u2019s character, his way with words and his assassination, together with the psychological needs of a racist society, have obscured his contradictions under a mountain of myths,\u201d he added.\n\nIn an interview after the article was published, he stuck to his guns. \u201cLast year, during the riot season, President Johnson said he hoped he would handle himself as Lincoln did during the Civil War,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he does, it will be a disaster.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Bennett expanded on his argument in 2000 in the book \u201cForced Into Glory: Abraham Lincoln\u2019s White Dream.\u201d The historian James M.

She died in 2009. His survivors include their daughters, Joy, Constance and Courtney, and three grandchildren. A son, Lerone III, died in 2013. Mr. Bennett lived in Chicago.\n\nIn an oral history recorded in 2010 for the National Visionary Leadership Project, which collects the stories of notable black Americans, Mr. Bennett talked about a three-part approach to affecting change.\n\n\u201cEvery black person is obligated,\u201d he said, \u201cto try to do what he does as well as any person who ever lived can do it, or any person who ever lives can do it; then, to try to save one \u2014 just one \u2014 person if you can.

Townships have gotten electricity and more modern housing. Government contracts have been set aside for black would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nThese programs have had an impact, improving material conditions and generating jobs.\n\nThey have also been riddled with corruption.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt local governments across South Africa, bureaucrats have abused their authority to steer contracts to companies that put cash in their pockets. At every level of society, people have grown accustomed to kickbacks and political connections determining who prospers, and who goes without.\n\nMr. Zuma\u2019s demise resonates as a sign of a potential new order taking shape. He will forever be linked to his association with the Guptas, three Indian-born brothers who effectively bought key levers of governmental power, amassing influence so comprehensive that it became known as \u201cstate capture.\u201d\n\nHis resignation has raised hopes that South Africa is finally contending with its epidemic of corruption. That view gained momentum when an elite police unit raided a home belonging to the Guptas nearly at the same moment that Mr. Ramaphosa was assuming office.\n\nThe new president is a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle, a former deputy president and chairman of the National Planning Commission, a focal point for thinking about how to engineer economic growth. As a former trade union leader and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Mandela, he enjoys credibility among a range of interest groups, while carrying a reputation as a savvy and strategic operator.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe has had his brushes with controversy, most notably after a 2012 police massacre of striking platinum miners that killed 34 people. At the time, Mr. Ramaphosa occupied a seat on the board of Lonmin, the company that owned the mine. Emails soon surfaced showing that, a day before the police opened fire, Mr. Ramaphosa had been urging senior government officials to take strong action to end the strike.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, no corruption charges have stuck to the new president, who now claims a mandate to clean up the toxic mess left behind by Mr. Zuma.\n\nSome doubt whether the A.N.C. can be salvaged as an effective vehicle for egalitarian policymaking. The party\u2019s executive ranks include many figures implicated in corruption. Mr. Ramaphosa, 65, may champion new initiatives aimed at generating economic growth, yet he finds himself relying on his party brethren to execute his visions, with no certainty that the money will land where intended.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think that taking the president out does much to dismantle the patronage network,\u201d said Ayabonga Cawe, a development economist at Xesibe Holdings, a research and advisory firm in Johannesburg. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need a lot more than taking out the guy at the top.\u201d\n\nAbove all, Mr. Ramaphosa must contend with the structural defects that have long constrained South Africa\u2019s economy, a legacy of apartheid.\n\nBeyond its systemic discrimination against black people, apartheid severed the country from much of the global economy. It ensured that huge numbers of uneducated black South Africans were available at poverty-level wages within major sectors of the economy like mining, agriculture and textiles. That cushioned domestic companies from the pressure to modernize.\n\nPhoto\n\nInternational sanctions isolated South Africa, shielding its firms from competition against multinational rivals. Sanctions also denied South African companies the ability to operate abroad, giving them an incentive to focus on the domestic market. The apartheid-era government obliged with subsidies for favored firms while allowing companies to pursue oligopoly, free of nuisances like antitrust law.\n\nThe result was a system in which large industries, from retail to furniture-making to chemicals, were dominated by huge enterprises whose core strength was the ability to protect themselves against competition. That system has largely prevailed, with smaller companies and start-ups facing often-impossible odds.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cApartheid was a system that lends itself to large conglomerates and concentrations of wealth in the hands of a few,\u201d Mr. Cawe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the corruption. It\u2019s about all of these parallel networks in big business that you need to dismantle. Most of those are white.\u201d\n\nHere is a world that Mr. Ramaphosa knows keenly, having achieved extraordinary affluence by running South African companies with interests in mining, banking, real estate and telecommunications. His fortune has been estimated at $450 million.\n\nIf he is serious about reinvigorating the economy and creating a space for black-owned small businesses, he will need to take on the prevailing structure that made him so wealthy.\n\nHis success on that front may be even more decisive than whether he can tame corruption.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly the most optimistic moment for South Africa in a very long time,\u201d said Mr. Goldin, the former adviser to Mr. Mandela. \u201cIn a way, it does feel like a new beginning.

Many Germans and Swedes now recognize \u2014 and some celebrate \u2014 the fact that their fellow citizens can have any skin color or religion. But the attempt to turn countries with monoethnic identities into truly multiethnic nations is a historically unique experiment, and so it should hardly come as a surprise that it has encountered some fierce resistance.\n\nThe situation in Canada and the United States, despite their histories as countries of immigration, has important similarities to that in Europe. Both have historically had rigid racial hierarchies. And in recent decades, both have made real steps toward overcoming these injustices: African-Americans, for example, are better represented in business and government than at any previous point in American history. This has made opposition to a more equal, multiethnic society more fervid among those who feel their privileges threatened. There is a sizable number of Americans for whom the idea of the nation remains synonymous with whiteness and Christianity.\n\nSo long as nationalism is associated with one particular ethnic or religious group, it will serve to exclude and disadvantage others. The only way to keep the destructive potential of nationalism in check is to fight for a society in which collective identity transcends ethnic and religious boundaries \u2014 one in which citizens from all religious or ethnic backgrounds are treated with the same respect as citizens from the majority group.\n\nTo effect this transformation is one of the great political challenges of our age. It requires principled resistance to right-wing nationalism, but it can succeed only if those who are most open to diversity abandon their hostility to other forms of nationalism.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nOne common reaction to the dangerous excesses of nationalism has been to forgo the need for any form of collective identity, exhorting people to transcend tribal allegiances completely. But for better or probably worse, it\u2019s easier to be moved by the suffering of people with whom we have some form of kinship. That is why nationalism remains one of the most powerful vehicles for expanding our circle of sympathy.\n\nAnother common reaction to the resurgence of nationalism has been to celebrate more narrow forms of collective identity, such as race or religion. At a time when many minority groups are under attack, it is, of course, crucial to defend them against discrimination. But it is also important to remember that such groups, too, are capable of oppressing their own members, for example by enforcing restrictive moral codes. That\u2019s why the only way to allow individuals true freedom to lead their lives is to preserve some form of political identity independent of the interests of particular cultural groups.\n\nConvinced that they would be unable to redirect nationalism toward their own ends, many of the most open-minded segments of society long ago gave up on the fight to determine its meaning. In countries like Germany and the United States, advocacy for the victims of prejudice has increasingly bled into a belief that the dark chapters of those countries\u2019 history make any form of nationalism deeply suspect. Instead of exhorting their fellow citizens to live up to their nations\u2019 highest ideals, many activists seem content with denouncing past and present injustices. This has allowed the bigots and racists to bend the meaning of the nation to their own sinister ends.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s time to fight back. Nationalism can, and should, be reclaimed for liberals.\n\nA few political leaders have made a valiant start. Barack Obama has been an especially persuasive advocate of the idea that Americans should focus on what unites rather than what divides us and that the symbolism of the nation can inspire hope, even as we reckon with the injustices of American history. \u201cWhat greater expression of faith in the American experiment than this,\u201d Mr. Obama marveled as he stood on the spot in Selma, Ala. where civil rights protesters were beaten in 1965. \u201cWhat greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished, that we are strong enough to be self-critical, that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is in our power to remake this nation to more closely align with our highest ideals?\u201d\n\nCampaigning for France\u2019s presidency last year, Emmanuel Macron expressed inclusive patriotism in an even more explicit form. \u201cI see Armenians, Italians, Algerians, Moroccans, Tunisians,\u201d he said at a rally in Marseille, a diverse city in southern France, \u201cBut what do I see? I see the people of Marseille! What do I see? I see the people of France!\u201d This, he added in an explicit repudiation of the exclusive nationalism propagated by the far-right National Front party, \u201cis what it means to be proud to be French!\u201d\n\nAmerican \u2014 and to a lesser degree European \u2014 political culture is pregnant with the symbols of inclusive patriotism. But while we have plenty of history to build on, we must also recognize that we are fighting to establish a kind of society for which there is no clear precedent.\n\nIn the United States, the model had once been a melting pot. But asking individuals to conform to one unified culture puts the price of admission to the nation too high. In Canada, the model is often said to be that of a salad bowl, in which the overall dish is enriched by the great variety of individual ingredients. But we can now see that this may be an overly idealized image of a society in which people feel that they have little in common across ethnic and religious divides.\n\nThere may not be a perfect culinary metaphor for the kind of country inclusive nationalists seek to create. But its contours should be obvious. It is a state in which all members have the same rights and opportunities irrespective of the group into which they are born or the culture to which they belong. It is a society in which people feel that they have something important in common because they seek to govern themselves together, pledge to help one another in an hour of need and recognize that these shared commitments are ultimately more consequential than any difference of color or creed. And it is a culture that does not shy away from celebrating the nobility of this collective identity \u2014 embracing the nation\u2019s flag not because we claim never to have failed our compatriots in the past but because we aspire to realize a common future fair to all.\n\nIt would be tempting to say that this kind of patriotism has little in common with the nationalism that is now ascendant around the world. Patriotism, some philosophers argue, should be understood as an innocent love of country that is inclusive at home and cooperative abroad. Nationalism, by contrast, excludes other ethnicities and stands in competition with the interests of other countries.\n\nBut it is too clever by half to pretend that we can safely stoke the good aspects of patriotism without ever running the danger of exacerbating the worst aspects of nationalism. For the kind of patriotism I am proposing is not a completely different form of collective identity; it is, rather, one that proudly stands in competition with the exclusionary politics on display from Washington to Moscow to Beijing.\n\nNationalism is like a half-wild beast. As long as it remains under our control, it can be of tremendous use. But if we abandon it, others are sure to step in, prodding and baiting the beast to bring out its most ferocious side. For all the well-founded misgivings about it, we have little choice but to domesticate it as best we can.", "keywords": ["liberals", "identity", "society", "religious", "form", "common", "political", "patriotism", "collective", "reclaim", "nation", "nationalism"], "polarity": 0.14129125602529854, "subjectivity": 0.47932204517310895},

In young adult literature in particular, inventive, international stories told in newly empowered women\u2019s voices are claiming their rightful place at the table. Take these five new Y.A. books, ranging from fantasy to realistic fiction to memoir. In these authors\u2019 hands, non-Western sensibilities might reign in a vivid and original Yoruban religion-based world, or classical settings might be reinterpreted to create a universe in which beauty is not tied to race. A heartbreaking fictional front row seat to the Syrian refugee emergency is offset by a humorous true tale of growing up an Iranian-American immigrant without a green card.

After a childhood of training, the teenage Belles are introduced to upper-class society and tasked with transforming the hair, skin and bone structure of the race-fluid rich and royal. But when the rebellious Belle Camellia uncovers a plot by the truly vile Princess Sophia to enslave her and her sisters, she sows the seeds of a grass-roots revolution that is bound to blossom more fully in the inevitable sequel.\n\nPhoto\n\nClayton, a co-founder of the We Need Diverse Books organization, has created an opulent mash-up setting, which seems to be a cherry-picked combination of 18th-century France, Japan and the antebellum American South. If it never quite coalesces into a seamless cultural whole, readers seduced by the page-turning palace intrigue and the vivid food and clothing descriptions won\u2019t notice or care.\n\nMagic also lies dormant in the platelets of chosen teenagers in the Nigerian-American Tomi Adeyemi\u2019s debut, CHILDREN OF BLOOD AND BONE (Holt, $18.99; ages 12 and up).

Born with snow white hair and deep brown skin in the imaginary country of Or\u00efsha, young diviners morph into mighty, magic-wielding maji, or magicians, at 13. For centuries they relied on their powers (which Adeyemi based on aspects of the religion of the Yoruban people of West Africa). All that ended when the nonmagical King Saran ordered the slaughter of all adult majis. But when a mysterious scroll falls into the hands of Amari, a defiant princess, and Z\u00e9lie, a tenacious diviner warrior, the two young women set out on a thrilling, death-defying journey to restore magic and take back the throne.\n\nPhoto\n\nBlack Girl Magic, indeed! It\u2019s no surprise that this epic trilogy opener has already been optioned for film. Full of cinematic action sequences (the most memorable of them set almost entirely underwater and employing an army of the dead) and creatures worthy of Star Wars (horse-size \u201clionaires\u201d have saber teeth and horns), it storms the boundaries of the imagination. Yet it also confronts the conscience. Adeyemi\u2019s brutally depicted war between the noble, lighter-skinned kosidans and the enslaved, darker-skinned majis poses thought-provoking questions about race, class and authority that hold up a warning mirror to our sharply divided society.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Tareq is a Syrian refugee whose perilous journey is narrated by the voice of Destiny, characterized as a kindly, prosaic entity. After Tareq\u2019s mother, grandmother and four of his siblings are killed by a bomb, he and his father flee to Turkey with his remaining sister, Susan. They hopscotch from Turkey to Greece, Serbia, Slovenia, Austria and finally to Germany, where he finds a fragile safety. Along the way he witnesses beheadings and drownings, but also experiences the kindness of aid workers like Alexia, an American student. Abawi, a foreign news correspondent, does an admirable job of showing the grim horror of refugee life. But her efforts are occasionally undermined by cartoonish villains (\u201cYou tink you will be saved? Who will save you? Captain America is not real, just movies\u201d) and by some of Destiny\u2019s well-meaning but obvious platitudes: \u201cWhen you truly love someone, their life means more to you than your own.\u201d These interruptions may pull readers out of the story, though perhaps that distance is necessary for adolescents trying to process something as bleak and overwhelming as the Syrian refugee crisis.\n\nPhoto\n\nOf course, once refugees finally arrive in their adopted country, new problems arise. Until she was 13, Sara Saedi, an Iranian-American television writer and the author of the memoir AMERICANIZED: Rebel Without a Green Card (Random House, $17.99, ages 12 and up), was cheerfully oblivious of her family\u2019s immigration status. After her older sister breaks the news that they are \u201cillegal,\u201d Saedi suffers through the usual teenage rites of passage at her Silicon Valley high school (unibrow management, pimple wars, pot smoking) with the added pressure of possible deportation hanging over her head. Saedi adroitly and humorously uses these universal pubescent ordeals to contextualize Iranian culture and the immigrant experience. A memory of being teased about her eyebrow in ninth grade expands into a discussion of beauty norms: When her mother praises her for being hairless, \u201cshe meant by Persian woman standards. I was still hairy by everyone else\u2019s standards.\u201d And she has the sobering realization that pot is a privilege American teenagers can enjoy, but not undocumented kids: \u201cIf I got caught, I\u2019d have a criminal record that could be grounds for deportation.\u201d Very funny but never flippant, Saedi mixes \u201990s pop culture references, adolescent angst and Iranian history into an intimate, informative narrative that thoroughly defies current divisive views on immigration.\n\nPhoto\n\nMary H.K. Choi\u2019s blushingly tender and piquant debut novel, EMERGENCY CONTACT (Simon & Schuster, $17.99; ages 14 and up), about two isolated, misfit college students from Austin who fall in love via text message explores our emotional rather than geographical divides. In \u201cEmergency Contact,\u201d a Korean-American would-be writer named Penny keeps everyone at a distance, the result of living with a single, oversharing mom she calls \u201cthe equivalent of \u2026 human glitter.\u201d But when she rescues Sam, a half-German, half-Polish student filmmaker, from the sidewalk during a panic attack, she becomes his \u201cemergency contact,\u201d and he hers. Their charged, initial banter on text soon develops into increasingly personal exchanges about art, death, unstable moms and pregnant ex-girlfriends. Yet their burgeoning bond keeps stalling out. Burned by past relationships and millennial-ly tethered to their devices, they struggle to connect romantically IRL. Sam \u201ccouldn\u2019t imagine the space Penny would take up in his life if she sprang out of his phone,\u201d and Penny admits \u201cSam was her phone and her phone was Sam.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nChoi, a culture correspondent for HBO\u2019s Vice News, inserts timely issues like sexual assault, cultural appropriation and even DACA into her characters\u2019 intimate conversations, but it is her examination of digital vs. F2F communication that feels the most immediate.

She takes comfort from local efforts like a project in Utica, N.Y., where Bosnian Muslim immigrants and local Unitarian Christians watched a Super Bowl together. She applauds aggressive racial integration programs like those run by the American military. She cites her own teaching experience in small seminars at Yale, where students from divergent backgrounds overcame disagreements to achieve mutual respect, sometimes even friendship.\n\nPhoto\n\nYet the scholar in Chua acknowledges that these individual experiences offer less of a social lesson than she would wish.\n\n\u201cStudies show that minimal or superficial exposure to out-group members can actually worsen group division. \u2026 Negative interactions with people from other groups also increase group hostility. So merely putting members of different groups in the same space is not enough and indeed can aggravate political tribalism.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Chua falls back on the very attitude to which she turned her sharply skeptical gaze at the beginning of the book: the conviction that the United States was, is and will remain an exceptional nation, different from all the others. In her introduction, Chua remarked that the United States as a supertribal entity indifferent to ethnicity and culture became at best a partial reality only a generation ago. By book\u2019s end, however, the battered ideal has been polished and refurbished.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Will we, telling ourselves \u2018These immigrants are different,\u2019 be the weak link, the first generation to fail? Will we forget who we are?\u201d That\u2019s inspiring, and even more so are the citations of Martin Luther King Jr., Lin-Manuel Miranda and Langston Hughes that finish the book.\n\nInspiring \u2014 but not wholly reassuring. A lot of the interest of \u201cPolitical Tribes\u201d comes from the strong sense it emanates of an author arguing with herself. Chua both condemns tribalism and respects its power. She insists that the United States alone of nations among the earth has often transcended it \u2014 and then presents impressive contrary evidence from the past and the present. Chua reckons with the many tribalisms of the American past: ethnic, religious and racial. She hopes for a future in which tribalism fades \u2014 even as she mercilessly details its accumulating strength.\n\nAs Chua notes, tribes can coalesce out of previously unrelated pieces. Immigrants to Europe from North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia \u2014 of different languages, ethnicities, folkways and religious practices \u2014 raised children who created for themselves a new identity as post-ethnic Muslims. ISIS, as Chua mordantly observes, is in its own way a melting pot, bringing together young men and women from across Europe, Asia and the Americas to fight for a new ideology. She quotes a New York Times article about young British girls lured to ISIS. For them, \u201cIslam is punk rock.\u201d\n\nTribes can be created by fission as well as by fusion. Chua suggests that in the United States, divisions that would once have been understood as class divides have been reinterpreted in our time as cultural, even when they are not ethnic. \u201cWhite Americans often hold their biggest disdain for other white Americans \u2014 the ones on the opposite side of the cultural divide.\u201d\n\nThese fast-evolving and ever-changing identities may look contingent from the outside. They feel overwhelmingly powerful to those inside. Chua repeatedly scolds American policymakers for underestimating the importance of ethnocultural identity in Vietnam in the 1960s, Venezuela in the 1990s and Afghanistan in the 2000s. Through her book pulses an evident worry that tribal claims are now overpowering national ones within the United States. If she cannot quite bring herself to make her own anxieties explicit \u2014 or figure out what if anything to do to address them \u2014 she is hardly alone.

Underwood Archives/Getty Images\n\n\u201cOur nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white \u2013 separate and unequal.\u201d\n\nFifty years ago, on March 1, 1968, these were the grim words of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, called the Kerner Commission after its chairman, Gov. Otto Kerner of Illinois.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson had established the commission to examine the disorders and violent protests in Detroit, Newark and well over 100 other American cities during the summer of 1967, and earlier. What it found was searing. \u201cWhat white Americans have never fully understood \u2013 but what the Negro can never forget \u2013 is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto,\u201d the commission concluded. \u201cWhite institutions created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it.\u201d\n\nMostly moderate and mostly white men, the members of the bipartisan panel carried the imprimatur of the political establishment. Their recommendations attracted widespread public debate. The paperback edition of the report sold over two million copies.\n\nOccupied by the Vietnam War and concerned about the legacy of his Great Society domestic agenda, Johnson distanced himself from the \u201ctwo societies\u201d warning. But the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Robert Kennedy strongly endorsed the commission\u2019s findings and recommendations before they were assassinated and before more protests erupted during that traumatic year of 1968.\n\nThe Kerner Commission recommended \u201cmassive and sustained\u201d investments in jobs and education to reduce poverty, inequality and racial injustice.

Today, the top 1 percent receive 52 percent of all new income. Rich people are healthier and live longer. They get a better education, which produces greater gains in income.

I\u2019d love to jump right in and hear your aspirations for Prairie View. What do you hope to accomplish in your time as president? I assume you had many offers to lead other colleges. Why was Prairie View different?\n\nRuth Simmons: Well, I\u2019m a native of Texas, and one of the things that I did when I returned to Houston after I retired from Brown was think about the ways I could use my experience to help the community. I started with small ventures in the city, but I hadn\u2019t thought really that another university would be in my life. But when I was approached by Prairie View, I thought immediately about its significant impact on my brother, who went there. And what Dillard did for me.\n\nI grew up in a segregated neighborhood in Grapeland, Tex., with very little experience with the world. The transition that Dillard enabled for me was extremely valuable. As an undergraduate, I began to grow a sense of confidence that helped me move from a fairly insular environment to a bigger stage when I went to graduate school.\n\nMy aspirations for Prairie View are to essentially make sure the university is continuing to do the same thing for students today that it did for my brother \u2014 and Dillard did for me. And that is to offer the advantage of a strong education that will prepare students for the careers they want, in a social and cultural context that helps them develop the confidence to perform after graduation.\n\nAs president, that means focusing on time-honored strategies to success that apply to universities everywhere: worrying about the faculty who are recruited here, the campus experience, and whether we are providing the leadership and internship opportunities that students need. It means worrying about the reputation of the university. It\u2019s obviously a much more competitive world today than it was when I was a student, but the underlying work to move the university to a level of achievement that makes students and alumni proud is the same.\n\nM.J.: What do you see as some of the major challenges facing historically black colleges and universities?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: The general challenge for H.B.C.U.s is not unlike the problem many universities face today, and that is the financial model. Being tuition dependent has become a large problem for all universities. H.B.C.U.s are dependent on raising money, but that is a reality that most universities obviously face. So it very much depends on the question of whether the schools have a good-enough foundation because of secure financing. When it comes to the federal government\u2019s role in supporting H.B.C.U.s, I think we don\u2019t yet understand the extent to which they will be affected by the changes in Washington today. To say that many are not hopeful in this moment is an understatement. We just don\u2019t know.\n\nFrankly, that\u2019s why I advocate for developing enough financial independence to secure the future of our institutions. That means looking for different revenue streams, looking to increase our ability to raise funds and finding alternate programs that help to bring more income into our university. The only strategy cannot be to persistently raise tuition, making college outside the reach of many families.\n\nM.J.: You\u2019ve led several institutions that are all very different from each other, and the topic of leadership is something you\u2019ve talked a lot about. In another interview with The Times you said that it\u2019s much easier to lead people \u201cif you convey the underlying principles.\u201d Can you elaborate?\n\nR.S.: One thing that I\u2019ve learned is that the perceptions of what it takes to be a leader are often based on prototypical models that don\u2019t have much truth in reality. People look at the institutions that I have led and they see dissimilarities. I see similarities. When people think in terms of leadership, they\u2019re often thinking about the kind of specific skills needed for different types of enterprises. I think of leadership as more of a disposition \u2014 the ability to step into a situation to learn about the history of the enterprise, the opportunities that it faces, the culture that exists and the people who are served by it. To look at all of that, to listen to stakeholders and then to think about how that enterprise or institution should best be served. There is no one model of leadership if you approach it that way. What I have tried to do wherever I go is to start where the institution is rather than try to import particularly rigid constructs from other places. In that sense, I think a leader is more than anything else a facilitator. A person who is able to come in to show a community a picture of what it is, to provide some insight into what it could be \u2014 how it could be different or improved perhaps \u2014 and then enlist the help of people who are there and others who support that institution in order to move forward together.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nI don\u2019t subscribe to the model of hero leadership, which is identifying somebody who can come in and have magical powers and then wield the wand and fix things that have not been fixable before. I don\u2019t see that. I think leadership is a community affair.\n\nM.J.: That makes sense. So how do you approach educating the current generation of students at Prairie View to lead in the way you described?\n\nR.S.: People today are fond of leadership programs that theorize about the profile and tenets of leadership. And students anxiously get involved in those programs. I rather think that our entire campuses are incubators of leadership even without the formality of such programs because if we\u2019re doing what we should be doing, we are acclimating students to an environment in which they have to learn to work with others who are very different from themselves. And that seems to me to be the first requirement of leadership. To actually learn to work with people in a respectful and inclusive way is inordinately important. A campus provides one of the best opportunities for people to be able to do that because you sit in class alongside people whom you initially don\u2019t know. You are discussing your ideas, having people respond to them and often rejecting what you\u2019re saying. You are joining organizations that have certain aims that are being advanced by the collective, so you\u2019re learning how to facilitate. You are asked to step into leadership roles either through student government or organizations. Even in the classroom context you might play a leadership role. You have to learn to express yourself, to be convincing, to write out your ideas, to be more thoughtful than you\u2019d ordinarily be. All of those things are components of leadership.\n\nM.J.: Some would argue that social media, or perhaps disagreements over the concept of safe spaces, have made it more challenging for people to come together and to work together.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: Yeah, I would say that people frequently say that, but that has certainly not been my experience. I would say that in my days as a student, the tensions were higher, the disagreements were greater, the separation among us was certainly more pronounced. And people are kind of inventing a new narrative, that things are so much worse today than they were in the past. I don\u2019t buy that. I think we have new terminology, because the modern sciences of psychology and sociology and so forth and modern media have enabled us to peer into areas that we were not able to see as easily as before. And so when you have social media and all of the ways in which people can now say whatever they want to say \u2014 in an unartful or offensive way \u2014 that turns the volume up to be sure. But it doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t there before.\n\nI would say that the current situation ought to give us much more practice in how to engage with each other because it is not underground. It\u2019s out front, it\u2019s in the open. The media today and the things that are being reported should be upsetting or troubling to students, my goodness. But it may be an even better opportunity to engage students.\n\nAs a teacher, as an educator, I would say these times are especially fertile for teaching the skills that are needed in a world in which there are many types of people, many perspectives and so forth. Students don\u2019t need to feel silenced by the current situation. When students at Brown came to me and said, you know, they were hurt because somebody asked them about their hair, and they were tired of that and they didn\u2019t want any part of it, I would say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s just too bad!\u201d Somebody asked you about your hair, tell them about your hair. You are in college not to hide from that. You\u2019re there to teach the world about yourself, you\u2019re there to learn about others and to teach them about who you are. So I\u2019d rather think this whole notion of protecting people from that is something that we have to take in hand and deal with. And help students see the opportunity in that because if they engage with people who have those kinds of perspectives, they are going to be much stronger in the end than if they run away.\n\nM.J.: Do you see the situation differently for students at H.B.C.U.s? You mentioned that Dillard gave you the space to learn and build confidence before heading to graduate school.\n\nR.S.: There is a narrative that many people have for H.B.C.U.s. People see them as a monolith, or only see them as filling a gap that exists for African-Americans. H.B.C.U.s are not a brand. They are institutions with a certain history \u2014 they were originally set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for education \u2014 but they are not all alike, and are very diverse in what they offer.\n\nPrairie View, for example, is the second-oldest public institution of higher education in the state of Texas. It was set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for ex-slaves and whites. For a long time it provided educational opportunities for black students that wouldn\u2019t have been open to them otherwise. In nursing, architecture, engineering and other STEM fields at a time when many blacks were not able to go into those areas, the university was able to facilitate the entry of blacks into those professions.\n\nM.J.: Yes, this is something that Nikole Hannah-Jones has written about for The New York Times Magazine, in particular how Xavier University of Louisiana sends more black students to medical school than almost any other college in the country. I read that Prairie View has many more students who graduate with degrees in architecture and engineering.\n\nR.S.: Yes, going to Dillard is not like going to Prairie View. So the student who chooses to go to one H.B.C.U. may not find another appealing. That has to do with the unique features of the place, the academic culture and so on, the traditions. All of that makes a big difference.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen I went off to college, I was just trying to find a place where I could be a student without impediments that in that day and time were fairly widely known to be substantial if you enrolled in a majority-white institution. There was no question that in 1963, if you went off to college in the South, you had to be very careful about where you studied. The racial dynamic was very challenging at that time. One of the things I\u2019m learning now is that many of the students I speak to at Prairie View today have the same kinds of thoughts that I had those many years ago. They ask themselves, where can I feel comfortable so that I don\u2019t have to worry about anything but my academic work? So certainly that plays a factor in why students apply to H.B.C.U.s. And for some H.B.C.U.s, applications are way up. But if you reach the point where you think that a category of institutions are the right choice for you \u2014 going to an H.B.C.U. just to go to an H.B.C.U. \u2014 then you\u2019re not thinking broadly enough.\n\nM.J.: As you look across the landscape of higher education, what other challenges do college students face today?\n\nR.S.: I guess I worry a lot about our students having the skills and the experience to promote respectful interactions with a wide-ranging group of people. Students can be quite passionate about what they see on the national scene and how sometimes dangerous they think it is \u2014 how unpleasant it is and so forth. But we\u2019ve got to try to find a way on our campuses not to taint the national picture as hopeless, or as being antithetical to anything that we can think of as good and admirable. The last thing we want is for our students to bow out and decide that it isn\u2019t worth trying to do anything about a hopeless situation.\n\nAnd I do think that civility goes hand in hand with being hopeful. Hopeful that the next person you meet you will be able to converse with you in a respectful way. Hopeful that the next election cycle is going to give you a chance to be engaged and able to do something that makes you feel a sense of your own agency. Hopeful that the things will get better rather than worse.\n\nSo much of what we have to do on our campuses is really to hold open the possibility for people that civil society will in the end right itself \u2014 if enough of us are engaged. I am so thankful every day for the fact that I grew up in a time when nobody thought blacks would be able to be integrated into American society, they would never be able to hold important positions, they\u2019d never be respected intellectually, they\u2019d never be able to do the things that they are now able to do. So why did we persist? And why did we continue to work toward betterment? We did it because we had people working with us in education who were ever hopeful that things were going to change. So I like to say to educators, you have to be always projecting to students that civility enables hopefulness to be ever resurgent.", "keywords": ["view", "say", "ruth", "prairie", "think", "leadership", "generation", "cultivating", "college", "today", "simmons", "things", "dont", "able", "students"], "polarity": 0.18839701321015756, "subjectivity": 0.47766767453623127},

They are quiet, almost too much so. But once you learn what happened in these scenes from small towns, big cities or verdant fields, their almost unemotional first impression gives way to horror: Someone was lynched there.\n\nStarting in 2016, Mr. Clasper traveled through the United States seeking the sites of lynchings. He wanted to show how places that call no attention to themselves were the sites of hangings, slashings or execution by gunfire. In the course of covering 24 sites, they span 150 years, right up to the present century, and range from the American south to New York City.\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective, I take it back to 1903, when the American scholar and activist W.E.B. Du Bois said the problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line,\u201d Mr. Clasper said. \u201cIt seems to me not a lot has changed despite significant advances. There has been barely a year or generation that has passed where racism and violence have not been at the forefront of the American experience.\u201d\n\nAs the London-born son of a British mother and American father, Mr. Clasper said he had \u201ca deep spiritual connection to the American landscape.\u201d In this series \u2014 titled \u201cThe Spaces We Inherit\u201d \u2014 he hopes to gently confront viewers in a way that eschews graphic images of violence.\n\n\u201cI took a different approach and focused on the spaces to encourage people to look at this history from an altered perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve become desensitized to images of violence. But everything that happen s has to happen somewhere.\u201d\n\nGiven the persisting tensions over racial and religious prejudice, Mr. Clasper wants to gently provoke a necessary conversation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to investigate these deep-seated issues in America,\u201d he said. \u201cI think many agree that the nation has not dealt with its bloody past of lynchings and segregation. It seemed to me there has been no collective acceptance, let alone recognition of the mistakes made and the sins committed.\u201d\n\nInterviews were conducted by Oliver Clasper and have been edited for brevity.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Jesse Lee Bond, Arlington, Tenn., 1939\n\nOn April 28, 1939, a local sharecropper named Jesse Lee Bond was shot to death in broad daylight by employees of SY Wilson, a local hardware store. Jesse Lee Bond had asked for an invoice the day before after purchasing goods on credit, something that was no\u0095t done by African-Americans at that time as keeping sharecroppers in the dark about how much they had spent was one way for white owners to keep their workers in constant debt. The day of Jesse Lee Bond\u2019s murder he was ordered back to the store. His aunt accompanied him and witnessed the whole thing. \u201cThey shot at him and shot him. He ran out to the outhouse. They riddled the outhouse. And when he staggered out of the outhouse, they threw him down, castrated him, and dragged him to the river,\u0095\u201d she said. The family was told he had drowned accidentally.\n\nImage\n\nSylvester Lewis, Memphis\n\n\u201cI remember my cousin Jesse well. I was 9 when he was killed and he was 20. What I heard was that there had been a dispute at the SY Wilson general store over in Arlington. Jesse insisted on a receipt, but this is something they didn\u2019\u0095t do. I think whoever he was negotiating with relented, but I think the people over him, the father of the individual in question, didn\u2019\u0095t like it. They went to his home and said they wanted to talk to him and ordered him back to the store. When he returned they attacked him. He tried to run for his life but they caught up with him and shot him. I also heard that they dragged his body behind a vehicle and then dumped him in the river. The descendants are running the store now, and I\u2019\u0095m not sure they know what happened. The ones who were allegedly involved in the lynching passed a long time ago, but their relations are still in Arlington. I don\u2019t think there\u2019\u0095s any resentment now. Anyone who hears about it can\u2019\u0095t understand how that could happen. They simply can\u2019t relate to that kind of criminal activity.\u201d\n\nInterviewed November 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Emmett Till, Drew, Miss., 1955.\n\nIn what is one of the most significant race-related events in the history of the United States, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Chicago native, was brutally lynched in rural Mississippi on Aug. 28, 1955. Till, who had been visiting family members in the area, entered a local white-owned grocery store in the town of Money for less than one minute. Whatever was said between him and the proprietor, Carolyn Bryant, was used as the pretext for his murder. Four days later Till was abducted from his uncle\u2019\u0095s house by Roy Bryant, Carolyn\u2019\u0095s husband, and J.W. Milam and driven to a nearby barn where he was severely beaten and tortured (the original wall of the barn can be seen on the left of the photograph). He was then taken to the Tallahatchie River, shot in the head, and drowned with a cotton gin fan tied around his neck. In an infamous court case both defendants were found \u0094not guilty\u0095 by an all-white jury. Months later they sold their story and admitted their guilt, with Bryant claiming that the Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education that desegregated schools was a mistake. Emmett Till\u2019s mother, Mamie Till Bradley, allowed photos to be taken of her son\u2019s broken and swollen body because she \u201cwanted the world to see what they did to my baby.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nDr. Jeffrey Andrews, Drew, Miss.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know the history of the property when I purchased it in 2003 and it was only two years later that a few local people told me of the Emmett Till murder. I\u2019ve lived in Drew since I was 12 and I had never heard of it. I\u2019ve since modified the barn to make it more functional and useful, and someone once asked me why I would change a historical site, but history is in the past and people should move on. Things have changed drastically here in the Mississippi Delta region and race relations are at all-time high. History is an important learning tool and it should be used to help people move forward, but one thing you have to remember is that people here don\u2019t want to be constantly reminded of how things were 60 years ago. We\u2019ve all moved forward, and sometimes people aren\u2019t given enough credit for the changes we\u2019ve made. I respect everyone\u2019s feelings towards Emmett Till, and I\u2019ve met some of his family members. They\u2019re great people. This has been a learning experience for my family and we appreciate the fact that we\u2019re part of a historical site.\u201d\n\nInterviewed March 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Joe Coe, Omaha, 1891\n\nOn Oct. 10, 1891, a 50-year-old African-American named Joe Coe (also known as George Smith) was accused of sexually assaulting a 5-year-old girl and was quickly arrested. Rumors spread that the girl had died and that Coe would get off lightly, neither of which was true. A frenzied mob seized him from the jail at the Douglas County Courthouse, put a rope around his neck, and dragged his body through the streets. Coe was then hanged from a streetcar wire on the corner of 17th and Harney in front of thousands of onlookers. Souvenirs of the rope were later sold. Mayor Richard C. Cushing of Omaha condemned the lynching as \u201c\u0094the most deplorable thing that has ever happened in the history of the country.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Ell Persons, Memphis, 1917\n\nWhen the decapitated body of a 16-year-old local, Antoinette Rappel, was found near the old Wolf River Bridge in May 1917, Ell Persons, a local black woodcutter, was deemed a possible suspect. Despite being arrested and released twice, he was captured a third time and forced to confess. A local mob announced that he was to be lynched the next day. The news spread, and a crowd of 3,000 turned up to witness his lynching (including students of Central High School). Ell Persons was burned on a makeshift pyre in a carnival-like atmosphere. He was then decapitated, and his head was taken to the predominantly African-American Beale Street and thrown at locals. A century later his lynching was commemorated and a historic marker was erected near the site.\n\nImage\n\nAmal Altareb, Memphis\n\n\u201cI came to America in 2012 from Yemen. I\u2019m still learning the language and the history, and it wasn\u2019t until the spring of last year that I learned about lynchings. I knew some of the history of segregation and Jim Crow laws, and I knew how unfair the system was \u2014 that African-Americans weren\u2019t treated as equals \u2014 but I didn\u2019t know that human beings had been burned or hanged from a tree just because of their race. Last year my class at Central High School were discussing it and I asked what lynchings were and they were surprised that I didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s surprising that humans can go so far as to kill someone else in this way and create a festival-like atmosphere. There were even spectators. Uncovering the truth is painful, but it\u2019s important. The African-American students especially don\u2019t talk about it because it\u2019s painful, and it reminds them of the injustices towards their race. White Americans don\u2019t want to remember either because of the guilt they feel. I can understand why people want to avoid the topic, but we need to face history in order to move forward.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Leo Frank, Marietta, Ga., 1915\n\nMary Phagan, 13, was found dead on April 26, 1913, at a National Pencil Company factory where she worked. Amid an atmosphere of anti-Semitism and despite conflicting evidence, a Jewish superintendent named Leo Frank was convicted of the crime. Frank\u2019s sentence was later commuted from the death penalty to life imprisonment, a decision that led a mob on Aug. 17, 1915, to seize him from state prison and lynch him from a tree in Marietta, Mary Phagan\u2019s hometown. Later that year the second chapter of the Ku Klux Klan was founded on Stone Mountain, with a number of Leo Frank\u2019s murderers present. Leo Frank was posthumously pardoned in 1986.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of George W. Murray, Mae Murray Dorsey, Roger Malcom and Dorothy Malcolm, Walton County, Georgia, 1946\n\nAfter Roger Malcom, a World War II veteran and Georgia sharecropper, had been bailed out of jail after allegedly stabbing a white man, members of the local community decided to take revenge. On July 25, 1946, a mob of 15 to 20 stopped the car Malcom was riding in with his wife, Dorothy, and another couple, George W. Murray and Mae Murray Dorsey, who was pregnant. They tied the four of them to a nearby tree and shot them to death. Mae Murray Dorsey then had her unborn baby ripped out of her. Despite an F.B.I. investigation nobody was brought to trial for the crime, and a few months later a grand jury was \u201cunable to establish the identity of any persons guilty of violating the civil rights statute of the United States.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nCeleste Butler, Omaha\n\n\u201cTracing one\u2019s roots and one\u2019s history is hard, especially as an African-American. These are big questions we all want to know: Who are we and where do we come from? I had DNA testing done recently but it didn\u2019t lead anywhere. It just told me that my ancestors came from West Africa, but it couldn\u2019t say where exactly. Missing that part and not being able to hand it down to my children or grandchildren is frustrating. On top of that you hear some people in this country telling black people to \u2018go back home.\u2019 Home to what? Home to whom? It feels like a total assault both mentally and physically to have chapters and generations missing. Not being able to fill that void is difficult. When it comes to racial violence I feel like we\u2019re constantly suffering from PTSD. It\u2019s a stress that never really goes away. A lot of people suffer in pain and in silence, and they suffer for successive generations. Everything was stripped from us, and we\u2019ve been struggling to put the pieces back together ever since.\u201d\n\nInterviewed September 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Michael Donald, Mobile, Ala., 1981\n\nMichael Donald, 19, was abducted on March 21, 1981, by Henry Hays and James Knowles as he was walking home. They beat him, slit his throat, and hanged his body from a tree outside 114 Herndon Avenue. The pretext for Donald\u2019s murder was a \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict handed down by a partially black jury to an African-American man accused of killing a white police officer. This incensed the Alabama chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, led by Benny Jack Hays, the father of Henry Hays, who suggested killing a random black person in response. Michael Donald\u2019s mother, Beulah Mae Donald, with the help of the Southern Poverty Law Center, brought a case not just against the killers but also the United Klans of America. Beulah Mae Donald won the case and received $7 million in damages, essentially bankrupting the U.K.A. Henry Hays was executed, while Knowles received life imprisonment. Hays is the only known Klan member to have been executed in the 20th century for the murder of an African-American. Herndon Avenue has since been renamed Michael Donald Avenue and a historic marker has been erected.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Mulugeta Seraw, Portland, Ore., 1988\n\nOn the evening of Nov. 13, 1988, an Ethiopian student named Mulugeta Seraw was being dropped off at his apartment when he was attacked by Kenneth Mieske, Kyle Brewster and Steve Strasser, members of a local racist skinhead group called East Side White Pride. Mieske delivered the fatal blows with a baseball bat. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 1990 Seraw\u2019s family, represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, brought a civil lawsuit against the killers\u2019 affiliated group, the White Aryan Nation, and its leaders, Tom and John Metzger, for $12.5 million. Tom Metzger later said that the killers had done their \u201ccivic duty\u201d by killing Seraw.\n\nImage\n\nJason Downard, Portland, Ore.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 2 I was put into foster care, and in 2009 I went to prison for a gang-affiliated drive-by shooting. I didn\u2019t grow up racist, but in prison the racist skinheads pulled me into their group and drilled stuff into my head about how the media is run by Jews and that they wanted an all-white nation. I also got a tattoo of a swastika on my leg, which I\u2019ve since had covered up. It\u2019s a painful reminder. The skinheads showed me support and love and compassion, which I hadn\u2019t experienced before in my life; everyone is looking for some kind of acceptance. I was angry and uncomfortable with who I was, and I drove that anger towards people who didn\u2019t look like me. In the last two years of the movement my sister had a son with a black guy and my nephew would give me this look like he knew what I was about. I started to get a guilty conscience and began to think about the things I thought I believed in. My sister said I\u2019d been brainwashed, and I can see why. The movement just taught me to hate and reinforced those views. The problem of racism in this country is much deeper than many people think. When it comes to Trump, he\u2019s tacitly endorsed the alt-right and white supremacists. It\u2019s been a ripple effect and things have gotten worse since he came into power. The right now feel emboldened. I look back now at some of the things I\u2019ve done and I realize that I\u2019ve hurt a lot of people. I decided I wanted to help others who had been in a similar position to me, and that\u2019s been my mission ever since. Now I work for an organization called Life After Hate. I\u2019m a marked man, and maybe I\u2019ll die doing this, but at least I\u2019ll die knowing I did the right thing.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Murder Site of Timothy Caughman, New York City, 2017\n\nOn March 17, 2017 James Harris Jackson traveled from his home in Baltimore to New York City with the intention of killing random black men. The reason, he later told police, was his hatred of interracial relationships. Three days later he found Timothy Caughman, 66, collecting cans in a trash bin on the corner of West 36th and 9th Avenue and stabbed him multiple times with an 18-inch sword. Caughman died of his injuries that night, and two days later Jackson turned himself in, telling police that he had planned to kill more black men in Times Square. On March 27, Jackson was charged with one count each of murder in the first and second degrees as an act of terrorism, second-degree murder as a hate crime, and three counts of criminal possession of a weapon.\n\n\u201cThe Spaces We Inherit,\u201d which will be published as a book by Overlapse in October 2018, is available for pre-order.\n\nFollow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

Though his inquiry is intensely, at times painfully personal, Mr. Wilkerson is above all concerned with unpacking the mechanisms of racial domination. The procedure is akin to performing surgery on a half-conscious subject, or digging up a buried land mine that has lost little of its explosive power.\n\nVideo\n\nThe focus of his excavation is a killing that took place in Dothan, Ala., in 1946, when S.E. Branch, a white shopkeeper, shot Bill Spann, a black man who was in his store. Branch, Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s great-grandfather, was charged with first-degree murder, but no trial was ever held, and the crime faded from memory. Or rather, the memory of it was quietly and systematically suppressed. All that remains are a short newspaper article and a few photographs and home movies of the killer.\n\n\u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d proceeds on several parallel tracks. Mr. Wilkerson returns to Alabama and tries to discover both how Bill Spann died and how he was forgotten. His investigation, accompanied by haunting images of Southern back roads and quiet houses, is punctuated by reminders that Bill Spann\u2019s death is hardly a unique or anomalous event. The names of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and other recent victims of racist violence appear onscreen, and two songs of protest loop into the soundtrack: Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s \u201cHell You Talmbout\u201d and Phil Ochs\u2019s \u201cWilliam Moore.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat song, about a white postal worker and civil rights activist murdered on an Alabama highway in 1963, is the source of the film\u2019s title and a part of its wider cultural context. \u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d is a passionately political film, aflame with rage in spite of its director\u2019s measured, ruminative tone of voice. It is also a horror movie, full of specters and silences and a terror that is pervasive, intimate and elusive.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Wilkerson, whose previous films include \u201cAn Injury to One\u201d and \u201cFar From Afghanistan,\u201d dispenses with many of the usual techniques of historical documentary. There are a few on-camera interviews, with neighbors and relatives, but more frequently Mr. Wilkerson narrates encounters that took place off camera. And his sleuthing often leads not to moments of revelation but to dead ends and deeper mysteries. The insertion of clips from \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d provides a chilling and ironic counterpoint to the grim story this movie is telling. S.E. Branch is the opposite of Gregory Peck\u2019s brave and decent Atticus Finch, and the truth about what happened to Bill Spann resists the kind of redemptive, healing conclusion that remains a cornerstone of American racial fantasy.\n\nInstead of consolation, Mr. Wilkerson offers commitment. Instead of idealism, honesty. He doesn\u2019t suppose that his film will solve anything, but there is nonetheless something profoundly useful about the way he confronts past and present manifestations of white supremacy. He links his great-grandfather\u2019s crime to the contemporaneous gang rape of Recy Taylor (the subject of an excellent recent documentary by Nancy Buirski), and uncovers patterns of abuse within his family. He corresponds with a relative who is part of a white nationalist, \u201cSouthern secessionist\u201d group. He notes the way racial injustice dwells in apparently mundane facts. The killer is immortalized in pictures and a well-kept tombstone. His victim has been almost entirely erased from memory, a kind of second death beyond the reach of redress or revenge.", "keywords": ["bill", "supremacy", "wilkerson", "wonder", "mr", "memory", "spann", "racial", "review", "white", "reckons", "movie", "gun", "fired"], "polarity": 0.04540441176470589, "subjectivity": 0.3202205882352941},

People like to have labels for actors, and the truth is, every actor is a character actor. When I say actor, I mean actresses as well. Toni Collette is a good example of someone who can do both leading lady and transformational characters, where you\u2019re barely recognizing them.

I can relate to self-loathing. The reason a person lashes out the way Dixon does is because he hates himself, so anybody can relate to that. I\u2019m drawn to complex characters; they\u2019re all filled with so many different feelings, and that\u2019s what makes them interesting. The first \u201cIron Man,\u201d Tony Stark, was an interesting character. He drinks too much, he\u2019s a womanizer, and then he has this epiphany. That\u2019s what\u2019s interesting.\n\nWhat do you think it was about this role, and this film, that led to so many awards?\n\nIt\u2019s the transformational aspect of it, the fact that he was really many different roles wrapped up in one role. He\u2019s a doofus, he\u2019s a racist, he\u2019s violent, he\u2019s a mama\u2019s boy. There\u2019s a few heroic things at certain points. But he\u2019s very flawed, and it\u2019s a boy-to-man journey.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere\u2019s been criticism that your character got away scot-free for his racist behavior and for throwing a guy out the window, and never being brought to justice.\n\nIt\u2019s a small town and, who knows, in real life maybe he would have gotten thrown in prison. It\u2019s a sort of dark fairy tale in certain ways \u2014 it\u2019s not necessarily meant to be completely realistic. And if it is meant to be realistic, in real life, things aren\u2019t tied up in a bow. People who deserve to get punished don\u2019t necessarily get punished.\n\nDid it surprise you that there was criticism of the movie along these lines?\n\nNo, whenever a movie is popular and it is a complex dramatic story, I think it\u2019s going to stir up a lot of feelings. A lot of good stuff come out of it \u2014 the billboards that have been popping up [activists recreated versions of the billboards in Miami and London]. That\u2019s kind of incredible, when a movie can effect social change, that\u2019s kind of astounding. I think Mildred [the film\u2019s mother, played by Frances McDormand, who is seeking justice in the murder of her daughter] is a really beautiful working-class wonder woman in some ways. It\u2019s a kind of antihero slash protagonist thing that I think women really need right now. Mildred and [the directors] Greta Gerwig and Patty Jenkins. It\u2019s been an incredibly vibrant year.\n\nYou\u2019re a really good dancer \u2014 you can really bust a move. You did the splits on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d How did that come about? Is it self-taught?\n\nIt\u2019s a long story, but I hung out with a certain crowd, and it was a way to meet girls.\n\nWhat kind of certain crowd?\n\nSan Francisco is not all cable cars and Rice-A-Roni. There were some tough kids there. When I was in middle school, there was a more white supremacist kind of group I didn\u2019t get along with. I got in a lot of fights with them and didn\u2019t win a lot of those fights. I didn\u2019t get along with the rich kids, people we called WPODs: white punks on dope. My school was interracial, and I met a cool group of friends who introduced me to some other friends. I used to do really bad break dancing, when \u201cThriller\u201d and \u201cPurple Rain\u201d came out. I was into Run-DMC, Grandmaster Flash, Doug E. Fresh, Eric B. & Rakim. Probably my biggest inspiration was James Brown, and watching Tom Cruise in \u201cRisky Business.\u201d I remember practicing that, and watching James Brown do the splits. I [recently] did SoulCycle, I\u2019m not proud to say, and Usher was next to me. I thought I had rhythm until I was on a bicycle next to Usher. This is what happens when you go to spinning class in Hollywood.\n\nWere you intimidated working with Frances McDormand?\n\nI think it\u2019s the biggest compliment to Frances that people are asking, \u201cWere you intimidated by her?\u201d Not really, but I was nervous to get in the ring with a great actor. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of great actors. She\u2019s really a force. I think what\u2019s great about her is her integrity. Her sense of truth is like an iron bar. All these people \u2014 Woody [Harrelson, a co-star], Martin [McDonagh, the film\u2019s writer-director], Frances \u2014 are true anarchists, they really are. I think it comes through in their work. I\u2019m not exactly conventional either.\n\nSo your dad posted a comment on that New York Times essay criticizing the film \u2014 he defended you. Was it definitely your dad?\n\nYes that was my father. I didn\u2019t read the article, but they read that quote to me on the Jimmy Kimmel show. That was my dad being a supportive father.

While it may not be a common vantage point, the narrative is a natural one for Marilyn Stern, a photographer and graphic artist who is a member of the Metropolitan Postcard Club of New York City.\n\nNot surprisingly, the vast majority of postcards that feature black people in the United States from the 19th and 20th centuries were very racist, she said.\n\n\u201cI was so sick of seeing these horrible racist stereotypes,\u201d said Ms. Stern, a collector since the mid-1970s. \u201cWhenever I came across something that was not racist or not stereotypical, or even went so far as showing romance between the races, I wanted to save it and collect it.\u201d\n\nHer collection, which numbers about 3,000, has about 300 postcards that depict African-American life in all lights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for us to fathom how isolated people were, especially in rural areas and isolated small towns before there were telephones and radios,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were postal deliveries three times a day, so it was the internet of the early 1900s.\u201d\n\nPostcards had better printing technology than magazines and newspapers did at the time, as the burst of color in the selection below shows. They could show racism with clarity. \u201cThe idea that you could see images so realistic blew people away,\u201d she said.\n\nMany of the racist postcards were a form of propaganda, she said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to see how racism was manifested in the past,\u201d she said, \u201cperhaps to better fight it in the present. You can recognize something if you\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d\n\nBelow is a selection from Ms. Stern\u2019s collection with descriptions based on her research.\n\nTrade Cards\n\nImage\n\nAfrican-Americans were often subjects \u2014 and targets \u2014 of advertising cards that were issued before 1900. These cards were frequently given away in products, or with the purchase of a product.\n\nAbove, an advertisement for J & P Coats thread. Below, a country doctor dispensing Ayer\u2019s Cathartic Pills.\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk, a dance created by plantation slaves as a satire of Southern white society, was the focus of these cards, which featured two black children and an African-American troupe that toured Europe in the late 1800s and early 1900s.\n\nRacist Cards\n\nImage\n\nThe card on the left was shot in a professional studio, but it was labeled \u201cHer Country Cousins.\u201d The implication was that no matter how refined, educated or successful black Americans became, they were still basically savages, Ms. Stern said.\n\nThe two cards on the right were produced in 1905 in New York on the common theme of the delivery stork. The first one, with the caption \u201cComparing Notes,\u201d shows both a black baby and a white baby, with no apparent bias. The second one shows two black babies with the slogan \u201cNo Race Suicide,\u201d implying that a high black birthrate threatened white supremacy, she said.\n\n\u201cLovers of All Nations\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThis postcard was from a series mailed in 1908 that was called \u201cLovers of All Nations.\u201d The banjo was a racial stereotype, but the card is in the non-discriminating \u201cFamily of Man\u201d tradition.\n\nMemories of Slavery\n\nImage\n\nPostcards once served as documentary photography. Some cards honored older African-Americans of the South, who were living memories of slavery.

But there\u2019s also venturing out into a different market, into different avenues where the African-American culture lives. We all have to do better at that.\u201d\n\nThere are challenges, of course. On social media, where vulgar epithets can be spewed from faceless and fictitious monikers, Wallace has, at times, had to think twice before responding. He admits he has not always been successful.\n\n\u201cThere is always going to be haters out there, people who don\u2019t want to see you succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that since Day 1 from my parents. Just keep your head down and keep moving, that\u2019s the best you can do.\u201d\n\nBlaney, his closest friend on the circuit, has been around Wallace when offensive remarks have been made.\n\n\u201cThankfully, it\u2019s very, very rare, but it upsets me,\u201d Blaney said. \u201cBubba\u2019s great at handling it. He\u2019s an amazing ambassador for the sport. And he\u2019s really talented and a heck of a competitor. All of us are competitive, but his competitiveness is unlike anyone I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nNascar\u2019s diversity has become an issue again after its only female racer, Danica Patrick, announced she will retire from the circuit after the Daytona 500. But Wallace is not the only driver who can energize an overlooked community. What he can do for an African-American audience, Su\u00e1rez can do for the Latino market. A native of Monterrey, Mexico, Su\u00e1rez said he had noticed an uptick in social media messages from a variety of Latino countries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually either people who tell me they\u2019re now following the sport because of me, or they\u2019ve been fans and now they have a driver to root for,\u201d said Su\u00e1rez, who is also a graduate of the Drive for Diversity program. \u201cThe potential is huge. This is the most diverse country in the world, but we have to improve diversity in Nascar. If we can make the sport more diverse, we\u2019ll see the same thing with fans. More diversity on the racetrack will mean more diversity in the stands.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Nascar waits, wondering who will emerge as its next star.", "keywords": ["nascar", "emerge", "su\u00e1rez", "petty", "leader", "generation", "hes", "drive", "sport", "wallace", "waits", "racing", "africanamerican", "diversity"], "polarity": 0.13599389129389128, "subjectivity": 0.4590651755651755},

After graduating from Lanier High School, he went to Morehouse College, the historically black institution in Atlanta, and was working on the student newspaper when it published some of the early writings of another Morehouse student, Martin Luther King Jr. Mr. Bennett graduated in 1949, the year after King did, and went to work at the black newspaper Atlanta Daily World.\n\nHe moved to Jet magazine in Chicago in 1953 as an associate editor and to Ebony, its sister publication, a year later. He became senior editor there in 1958 and later executive editor. He worked for the magazine into his 80s.\n\n\u201cBefore the Mayflower\u201d established Mr. Bennett as a leading scholarly voice during the racial ferment of the 1960s. In 1966 he testified before a House Education subcommittee looking into racism and unrest, and was blunt, tracing the turmoil of the times to an education system that did not prepare students to live in a multiracial society.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt is my opinion, and the opinion of many writers and scholars in this field,\u201d he said, \u201cthat segregated textbooks \u2014 and segregated and segregating use of words, symbols and ideas \u2014 are as dangerous to the internal peace of America as segregated schools and residential areas.\u201d\n\nThat was relatively mild compared with what he said about Abraham Lincoln in a January 1968 article in Ebony. Despite his reputation as an emancipator, Mr. Bennett wrote, Lincoln was actually a white supremacist who thought that the races would be better off separated, \u201cpreferably with the Atlantic Ocean or some other large, deep body of water between them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe man\u2019s character, his way with words and his assassination, together with the psychological needs of a racist society, have obscured his contradictions under a mountain of myths,\u201d he added.\n\nIn an interview after the article was published, he stuck to his guns. \u201cLast year, during the riot season, President Johnson said he hoped he would handle himself as Lincoln did during the Civil War,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he does, it will be a disaster.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Bennett expanded on his argument in 2000 in the book \u201cForced Into Glory: Abraham Lincoln\u2019s White Dream.\u201d The historian James M.

She died in 2009. His survivors include their daughters, Joy, Constance and Courtney, and three grandchildren. A son, Lerone III, died in 2013. Mr. Bennett lived in Chicago.\n\nIn an oral history recorded in 2010 for the National Visionary Leadership Project, which collects the stories of notable black Americans, Mr. Bennett talked about a three-part approach to affecting change.\n\n\u201cEvery black person is obligated,\u201d he said, \u201cto try to do what he does as well as any person who ever lived can do it, or any person who ever lives can do it; then, to try to save one \u2014 just one \u2014 person if you can. And then to struggle to destroy a system which is multiplying black victims faster than all the black intellectuals and the black leaders in America can talk about.

{"title": "\n                    South Africa Sees Fresh Start for Economy, With the Same Challenges                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/business/south-africa-economy-ramaphosa.html", "text": "With the end of Mr. Zuma\u2019s tenure, international investors upgraded South Africa\u2019s prospects, sending the nation\u2019s currency, the rand, to a three-year high, while bidding up shares of South African companies.\n\nLonger term, the challenges confronting the incoming administration are enormous.\n\nFor decades, a succession of governments led by the A.N.C. have sought to bridge inequality with programs targeted at improving the lives of black South Africans. Townships have gotten electricity and more modern housing. Government contracts have been set aside for black would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nThese programs have had an impact, improving material conditions and generating jobs.\n\nThey have also been riddled with corruption.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt local governments across South Africa, bureaucrats have abused their authority to steer contracts to companies that put cash in their pockets. At every level of society, people have grown accustomed to kickbacks and political connections determining who prospers, and who goes without.\n\nMr. Zuma\u2019s demise resonates as a sign of a potential new order taking shape. He will forever be linked to his association with the Guptas, three Indian-born brothers who effectively bought key levers of governmental power, amassing influence so comprehensive that it became known as \u201cstate capture.\u201d\n\nHis resignation has raised hopes that South Africa is finally contending with its epidemic of corruption. That view gained momentum when an elite police unit raided a home belonging to the Guptas nearly at the same moment that Mr. Ramaphosa was assuming office.\n\nThe new president is a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle, a former deputy president and chairman of the National Planning Commission, a focal point for thinking about how to engineer economic growth. As a former trade union leader and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Mandela, he enjoys credibility among a range of interest groups, while carrying a reputation as a savvy and strategic operator.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe has had his brushes with controversy, most notably after a 2012 police massacre of striking platinum miners that killed 34 people. At the time, Mr. Ramaphosa occupied a seat on the board of Lonmin, the company that owned the mine. Emails soon surfaced showing that, a day before the police opened fire, Mr. Ramaphosa had been urging senior government officials to take strong action to end the strike.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, no corruption charges have stuck to the new president, who now claims a mandate to clean up the toxic mess left behind by Mr. Zuma.\n\nSome doubt whether the A.N.C. can be salvaged as an effective vehicle for egalitarian policymaking. The party\u2019s executive ranks include many figures implicated in corruption. Mr. Ramaphosa, 65, may champion new initiatives aimed at generating economic growth, yet he finds himself relying on his party brethren to execute his visions, with no certainty that the money will land where intended.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think that taking the president out does much to dismantle the patronage network,\u201d said Ayabonga Cawe, a development economist at Xesibe Holdings, a research and advisory firm in Johannesburg. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need a lot more than taking out the guy at the top.\u201d\n\nAbove all, Mr. Ramaphosa must contend with the structural defects that have long constrained South Africa\u2019s economy, a legacy of apartheid.\n\nBeyond its systemic discrimination against black people, apartheid severed the country from much of the global economy. It ensured that huge numbers of uneducated black South Africans were available at poverty-level wages within major sectors of the economy like mining, agriculture and textiles. That cushioned domestic companies from the pressure to modernize.\n\nPhoto\n\nInternational sanctions isolated South Africa, shielding its firms from competition against multinational rivals. Sanctions also denied South African companies the ability to operate abroad, giving them an incentive to focus on the domestic market. The apartheid-era government obliged with subsidies for favored firms while allowing companies to pursue oligopoly, free of nuisances like antitrust law.\n\nThe result was a system in which large industries, from retail to furniture-making to chemicals, were dominated by huge enterprises whose core strength was the ability to protect themselves against competition. That system has largely prevailed, with smaller companies and start-ups facing often-impossible odds.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cApartheid was a system that lends itself to large conglomerates and concentrations of wealth in the hands of a few,\u201d Mr. Cawe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the corruption. It\u2019s about all of these parallel networks in big business that you need to dismantle. Most of those are white.\u201d\n\nHere is a world that Mr. Ramaphosa knows keenly, having achieved extraordinary affluence by running South African companies with interests in mining, banking, real estate and telecommunications. His fortune has been estimated at $450 million.\n\nIf he is serious about reinvigorating the economy and creating a space for black-owned small businesses, he will need to take on the prevailing structure that made him so wealthy.\n\nHis success on that front may be even more decisive than whether he can tame corruption.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly the most optimistic moment for South Africa in a very long time,\u201d said Mr. Goldin, the former adviser to Mr. Mandela. \u201cIn a way, it does feel like a new beginning.
