Over the past decade and a half, the F.B.I. and other agencies have established broad power to pre-emptively investigate people in matters of international terrorism \u2014 raising expectations that the government should be able to prevent attacks.\n\n\u201cIf they had gotten a tip that someone was going to shoot up the embassy in Cairo, they would have been all over it.

But they could include both sanctions against Russian officials involved in the attack and covert measures \u2014 any of which would be likely to fray an already fragile relationship.\n\nThe administration\u2019s public statement echoed one in mid-December when it publicly blamed North Korea for a damaging ransomware attack known as Wannacry. In that case, however, the United States did not follow up with stiff penalties, in part because North Korea was already under heavy sanctions for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has used just about every lever you can use, short of starving the people of North Korea, to change their behavior,\u201d the homeland security adviser, Thomas P. Bossert, said at the time. \u201cSo we don\u2019t have a lot of room left here to apply pressure.\u201d\n\nPunishing other nations for cyberattacks has proven exceedingly difficult, particularly when the players are as sophisticated as North Korea and Russia. The Russian government flatly denied the allegations that it carried out the attack.\n\n\u201cWe think they have no basis and no foundation, and this is nothing else but the continuation of the Russo-phobic campaign,\u201d the Kremlin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters.\n\nThe administration had planned to issue the statement a day earlier to coincide with that of the British, according to a senior official, but delayed it after the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Fla.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe White House statement made no mention of an embarrassing related fact: The NotPetya attacks took advantage of vulnerabilities identified by the National Security Agency and then made public by a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Shadow Brokers, which some officials believe to be a front for Russian intelligence, obtained many of the N.S.A.\u2019s most valuable hacking tools, either by breaking into the agency\u2019s computer networks or with the help of an insider. The group has posted much of the stolen malware on the web; North Korea\u2019s hackers probably used the tools in their attack.\n\nIn a ransomware attack, the victim\u2019s files are encrypted, locking them out of their own computer systems, until they pay a ransom. Cybersecurity researchers estimate that criminals made more than $1 billion through these attacks last year, with victims ranging from the chief executives of major companies to small businesses and private individuals.\n\nWhile the motive for many ransomware attacks is financial, Russia\u2019s involvement suggests it was part of a broader strategy to destabilize Ukraine that dates back to Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In addition, insurers would not have to comply with provisions of the federal law limiting out-of-pocket costs, and they could impose caps on the dollar amount of benefits available to consumers.\n\nDean L. Cameron, the director of the Idaho Department of Insurance, said in an interview on Thursday that insurers could start selling the new state-based health plans as early as April.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to salvage the market,\u201d Mr. Cameron said. \u201cThe young and healthy people of all ages have left the market.

This could get broad bipartisan support.\u201d\n\nMr. Grassley\u2019s attempt to revive the legislation has slowly been gaining momentum in recent months, though it has attracted little of the fanfare that accompanied the previous effort. Thursday\u2019s vote, for example, was eclipsed by a high-stakes debate consuming the Senate over the nation\u2019s immigration laws.\n\nA small group of Republicans on the committee, including Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, opposed the bill. Mr. Cornyn was one of the foremost advocates of similar legislation in the last Congress, but he has come to believe that a narrower set of changes to prisons is more realistic than a sweeping sentencing overhaul.\n\nMr. Grassley\u2019s legislation, which so far has the support of more than 20 Democrats and Republicans, would significantly reduce mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenses and institute a new system for determining which offenders would be eligible for early release. It would also create programs to better prepare them to return to life out of prison.\n\n\u201cMandatory minimum sentences were once seen as a strong deterrent,\u201d Senator Richard J. Durbin, the lead Democratic author, said in a statement after the vote. \u201cIn reality they have too often been unfair, fiscally irresponsible and a threat to public safety.\u201d\n\nThe plan has support from groups as ideologically diverse as the billionaire conservatives Charles G. and David H. Koch and the American Civil Liberties Union, and its authors expect it could easily win majorities in both chambers of Congress if given a vote.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut it runs against the prevailing philosophy of the Trump administration and, in particular, the Justice Department under Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Mr. Sessions, who was instrumental in derailing the 2015 effort when he was still in the Senate, has ordered federal prosecutors to pursue the toughest possible charges and sentences for crime suspects, reversing Obama-era efforts to ease such penalties for some nonviolent drug offenders. Many Republicans in the House and Senate agree with that philosophy.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe conflict was laid bare on Wednesday when Mr. Sessions wrote a letter to Mr. Grassley calling the bill \u201ca grave error\u201d that would put more dangerous criminals back on the streets and tie up resources needed to fight violent crime and gang action.\n\n\u201cPassing this legislation to further reduce sentences for drug traffickers in the midst of the worst drug crisis in our nation\u2019s history would make it more difficult to achieve our goals and have potentially dire consequences,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe letter pushed Mr. Grassley, who has shouldered the legislation for three years, into a rare fury. He wrote on Twitter that he was \u201cincensed\u201d and told reporters that he resented the attorney general trying to tell a senator \u2014 especially one who guided his confirmation proceedings despite Democratic support \u2014 how to write the law.\n\n\u201cDo you realize that he\u2019s carrying out laws? He\u2019s no longer a senator,\u201d Mr. Grassley said. \u201cThat letter sounds just exactly like he still thinks he\u2019s a senator.\u201d\n\nHolly Harris, the executive director of the Justice Action Network, a bipartisan coalition advocating an overhaul, said that urgency had only grown since 2015, largely because of the opioid crisis that has ravaged communities across the country.\n\n\u201cCriminal justice reform is only controversial in one place in this country, and that\u2019s Washington, D.C.,\u201d she said, urging Republican leaders to move forward with the bill.\n\n\u201cThere is a high expectation across the country that Republicans will be supportive of these reforms,\u201d she added. \u201cAny effort by the opposition will not be well received not just by progressives but by conservatives, as well.\u201d", "keywords": ["senates", "grassley", "senator", "support", "hits", "sentencing", "roadblock", "overhaul", "push", "sentences", "senate", "drug", "bipartisan", "mr", "legislation", "republicans", "familiar", "renewed"], "polarity": 0.0872079696260024, "subjectivity": 0.5152235469448584},

But scores between the 25th and 75th percentiles are considered normal, Dr. Postal noted.\n\nA control group would have shown whether the diplomats who were posted in Cuba did better or worse than other subjects similar to them \u2014 ideally others in the State Department who also reported sleep problems, which can interfere with thinking.\n\n\u201cIt is common for non-brain-injured people to have one or two low scores when given a large set of tests,\u201d Dr. Postal said. \u201cThese test results may represent normal variability.\u201d\n\nDr. Christopher Muth, a neurologist at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, wrote an accompanying editorial noting that the report should be viewed with caution.\n\nThe diplomats were examined an average of 203 days after the purported incidents, and it is not known if they spoke to one another about their symptoms.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWith certain symptoms, you have to take the word of people describing the symptoms,\u201d Dr. Muth said in a telephone interview.\n\nAt the same time, the examiners knew the patients had been complaining of neurological symptoms, he noted.

He is married and has a 3-year-old daughter, and he took two trips to the United States in 2014, shortly after her birth, in an effort to register her as an American citizen.\n\nThe filing also contends he likely went to Syria in 2014 for several months and then returned there in March 2015. It says that he lied to the F.B.I. about several details, noting that travel records contradict his account of how long he was in the United States. And it cites Twitter posts and YouTube and Google searches that it portrays as indicating that he was a supporter of the Islamic State.\n\nLast September, as the Islamic State\u2019s self-declared caliphate in Syria and Iraq was collapsing, the man was captured by a Syrian militia at a checkpoint and identified himself as an American citizen before being turned over to the United States military.

Although he spoke freely during an initial interrogation conducted for intelligence purposes \u2014 a summary of that conversation is attached to the new court filing \u2014 he stopped talking and asked for a lawyer after being warned of his Miranda rights for a law-enforcement interrogation.\n\nThe Trump administration is now trying to persuade Saudi Arabia to take custody of him, according to officials familiar with internal deliberations. A judge has ordered the government to give the A.C.L.U. three days notice before any such transfer so that he could challenge it, if he wants \u2014 an order the Justice Department is appealing.\n\nMeanwhile, the underlying case is continuing. In a filing rebutting the government\u2019s factual account, the A.C.L.U. argued for a more favorable interpretation of the disputed facts about the scope and meaning of his involvement with the Islamic State, which is also called ISIS.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cContrary to the thrust of the government\u2019s contentions that petitioner is an ISIS fighter, and as petitioner told the government, he sought to understand firsthand and report about the conflict in Syria; was kidnapped and imprisoned by ISIS; and tried numerous times to escape \u2014 and not even the government alleges that he ever took up arms against the United States or anyone else,\u201d the A.C.L.U. rebuttal said.\n\nIn an interview on Thursday, Jonathan Hafetz, the lead A.C.L.U. lawyer on the case, maintained that the Trump administration lacked the legal authority to keep holding his client indefinitely in military custody.\n\n\u201cThe government has made numerous allegations which are inaccurate and misleading in many respects,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the fundamental flaw in its position is that it has no legal authority to hold this citizen in military custody. If the government wants to detain him, it needs to charge him with a crime. Otherwise it must release him.\u201d\n\nBut the Justice Department filing argued that the government has legal authority to hold Islamic State members as wartime detainees \u2014 even if they are citizens. It cited laws enacted by Congress in 2001 and 2002 to authorize using military force against the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 attacks and Saddam Hussein-era Iraq, saying they cover the Islamic State. That theory was first put forward by the Obama administration and has been disputed, but no court has ruled on whether it is correct.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s court filing also backstopped that theory by claiming that President Trump, as commander in chief, wields inherent constitutional authority, independent of any act of Congress, to detain wartime enemies when they are captured on a battlefield where American forces are fighting.\n\nThat claim recalled sweeping assertions of executive power made by the George W. Bush administration after the Sept. 11 attacks.

Aides recount, for example, that last month, when he reached Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on his cellphone in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Mnuchin relayed that he was in a meeting with King Abdullah II of Jordan. Mr. Trump requested to speak to the king, whom he then asked for help in dealing with the aggrieved president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nThere are no signs that Mr. Abbas is softening. The Palestinians broke ties with the administration in December, after Mr. Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital and announced plans to move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv. They complained bitterly that the United States had forfeited its role as a credible broker between them and the Israelis.\n\nTheir fury only deepened when Mr. Trump declared last month at a meeting with Mr. Netanyahu that he had taken Jerusalem \u201coff the table.\u201d Palestinians have long aspired to have East Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state. Mr. Abbas set off on a tour of world capitals, including Moscow, to see whether he could find another leader for the peace process.\n\nAdministration officials said they were confident that the Palestinians would recognize their lack of options and return to the fold eventually. But after swinging so heavily toward Israel, they also seem to realize the need to restore a semblance of balance to the statements made by administration officials.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s tone first changed on Sunday, when he told a right-wing newspaper, Israel Hayom, that he was concerned about the growth of Jewish settlements on the West Bank. \u201cSettlements,\u201d he said, \u201care something that very much complicates and always have complicated making peace.\u201d\n\nAsked what he meant by \u201ctaking Jerusalem off the table,\u201d the president said, \u201cJerusalem is the capital of Israel, and as for specific boundaries, I would support what both sides agreed to\u201d \u2014 language drafted by Mr. Greenblatt to keep open at least the veneer of a negotiated settlement.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump criticized the Palestinians for \u201cnot looking to make peace,\u201d he added, \u201cI am not necessarily sure that Israel is looking to make peace.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump has issued statements like those before, but officials noted that in this case, he was making them to a Hebrew-language paper read by the Israeli right.

He was trying to head off legislation annexing West Bank territory. But he was also trying to shore up support among hard-line members of his party in advance of the recommendation that he be charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust.\n\nHow those legal travails will affect Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s approach to a peace deal is hard to predict, analysts said, though some said they expected him to emphasize security issues over peacemaking for the next few months \u2014 a strategy that could lead to further friction with Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cThe rebuke of Bibi is quite unprecedented in the annals of the Trump-Bibi relationship,\u201d said Martin S. Indyk, who was Bill Clinton\u2019s ambassador to Israel, using Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s nickname. \u201cThis is about their desire to preserve their credibility for the peace process, having damaged it so much with the Jerusalem announcement.\u201d\n\nThe White House noted that Mr. Trump plans to meet with Mr. Netanyahu next month when the prime minister takes part in the annual meeting of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the nation\u2019s most powerful pro-Israel lobbying group. The meeting was long planned, said Mr. Raffel, who noted that the two men have a \u201ctremendous relationship.\u201d\n\nAnalysts said the White House would need more than a few sharp-edged statements toward Israel to persuade the Palestinians that the process was not stacked against them.

It indicated in the release that the remaining funds also would be donated to charity once remaining expenses are paid.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe tax return indicated that the committee already donated to six nonprofit groups, and inaugural officials pointed out that the $5 million in total charitable donations to those groups was more than Mr. Obama\u2019s committee donated.\n\nAmong the recipients of charitable donations, the White House Historical Association received $1 million, while the Vice President\u2019s Residence Foundation, which is devoted to decorating and furnishing the vice president\u2019s residence on the grounds of the Naval Observatory in Washington, received $750,000.\n\nThe American Red Cross, the Salvation Army and Samaritan\u2019s Purse, an evangelical group, received $1 million each. All three groups were involved in relief efforts after a string of hurricanes that ravaged the Gulf Coast, Florida and the Caribbean.\n\nAs questions mounted last summer about the inaugural committee\u2019s finances and pledged charitable donations, Mr. Barrack released a statement promising that \u201cmillions of dollars of reserve funds will be allocated to various charities, institutions and foundations in an amount that surely will exceed any previous inauguration.\u201d\n\nThe inaugural committee split the costs of staging a range of festivities with the taxpayer-funded Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies and various federal, state and local government agencies. Security costs alone were predicted to surpass $100 million, which will eventually be paid for by the federal government.\n\nAmong the top donors to Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural committee were the Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon G. Adelson, who donated $5 million, and corporations including Chevron, Boeing and AT&T.\n\nThe committee had previously filed a mandatory report with the Federal Election Commission listing its donors, and the donor names were omitted from the I.R.S. filing released Thursday.

That issue could be a political problem for those Democrats up for re-election in conservative states.\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, initially blocked that effort, saying Mr. McConnell was starting off on the wrong foot.\n\n\u201cThe majority leader\u2019s desire to vote on an unrelated, partisan immigration bill \u2014 legislation that is not only silent on Dreamers, but is silent on border security as well \u2014 is not a productive way to begin debate,\u201d Mr. Schumer said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Republicans were not interested in the Democratic maneuver.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe standoff left the Senate right where it has been for years \u2014 frozen by a deep reluctance on the part of leaders of both parties to force vulnerable incumbents to take politically challenging votes. That thinking has dried up floor debate and put tight restrictions on the movement of legislation, making it a central cause of congressional gridlock.\n\nIn 2014, Republicans could not get enough of pointing out that Senator Mark Begich, a first-term Democrat from Alaska, never had a single amendment he wrote voted on by the Senate, a fact they said highlighted a lack of influence. He lost his re-election bid.\n\nThe refusal to battle it out over amendments has frustrated lawmakers in both parties and left some strategists scratching their heads because they see little evidence that such votes are all that damaging in an environment where charges and countercharges fly freely.\n\n\u201cWhat I came here to do is vote,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. \u201cAnd I am chagrined that we are in a time when both sides seem in trepidation of voting because our political process has become so polarized.\u201d\n\nThis fight was supposed to be different. After provoking a brief government shutdown last month, Democrats agreed to support the necessary spending to reopen federal agencies in exchange for a promise from Mr. McConnell that he would allow a no-holds-barred debate on immigration policy. It fell short of the demand by Democrats for a solution to the Dreamer issue but offered the party hope that, because of bipartisan sympathy for the immigrants, it could push through a bill and pressure the House to pass it.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut while Mr. McConnell might have promised the debate, he did not promise to make it easy for Democrats. As could have readily been predicted, he backed the most conservative option presented on behalf of the president while trying to ensnare Democrats in tough votes to help preserve his majority in November\u2019s elections.\n\n\u201cMy Democratic colleagues have spent months demanding the Senate take up this issue,\u201d Mr. McConnell said Wednesday. \u201cThey even shut down the government \u2014 unnecessarily, I might add \u2014 in order to secure this very week of debate. But now that the time has come to make law instead of just making points, they\u2019re stalling.\u201d\n\nNearly all Democrats and eight Republicans ultimately got behind a compromise plan that would protect Dreamers but prevent parents who brought them into the country from gaining citizenship while diverting $25 billion to border security. It fell six votes short after the White House fought it tooth and nail, leaving the fate of the Dreamers as uncertain as the Senate\u2019s ability to get things done.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat was certain was that the debate many anticipated never occurred in a Senate that hosted storied fights between John C. Calhoun and Daniel Webster over slavery. Stephen A. Douglas and Abraham Lincoln later clashed in a series of remarkable showdowns as they sought the Senate seat from Illinois in 1858, setting Mr. Lincoln up for his presidential election despite his Senate loss.\n\nAnd in October 2008, Senator Joseph R.

Sarah Palin of Alaska squared off for the right to preside over the Senate as vice president of the United States. \u201cCan I call you Joe?\u201d Ms. Palin asked in a more memorable moment.\n\nThe confrontation this week loomed as a test of whether the Senate could regain its debate footing and find answers on an issue all agree desperately needs resolution.

On Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security released a scathing critique of the latest bipartisan plan, which Mr. Trump vowed to veto.\n\nHere is how different proposals address the Dreamers\u2019 protections and five other critical issues:\n\nProtections for Dreamers\n\nMORE GENEROUS MORE RESTRICTIVE Path to citizenship for Dreamers and renewable legal status for parents 3-year renewable legal status for DACA recipients (a subset of Dreamers) Path to citizenship for Dreamers MORE GENEROUS MORE RESTRICTIVE Path to citizenship for Dreamers Path to citizenship for Dreamers and renewable legal status for parents 3-year renewable legal status for DACA recipients (a subset of Dreamers)\n\nAbout 700,000 undocumented immigrants are currently shielded from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. An additional 1.1 million Dreamers were eligible for the program, but they did not apply. Mr. Trump announced plans to phase out the program by March 5.\n\nMost of the major proposals in Congress include a path to citizenship for Dreamers. One, a more moderate bipartisan Senate proposal introduced by Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, along with four other senators in the so-called Gang of Six, would also allow parents of Dreamers to obtain three-year renewable legal status.\n\n(That proposal was rejected during a White House meeting in which Mr. Trump reportedly derided people from African nations.)\n\nPath to citizenship and parent benefit Path to citizenship No citizenship Proposal by: House Republicans White House Senator Flake Gang of Six McCain-Coons Common Sense Coalition The Senate voted down the proposals in yellow. Path to citizenship and parent benefit Path to citizenship No citizenship Proposal by: House Republicans White House Senator Flake Gang of Six McCain-Coons Common Sense Coalition The Senate voted down the proposals in yellow.\n\nA more conservative approach, written by the House Judiciary Committee chairman, Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, and supported by other Republicans in the House, does not provide a path to citizenship for Dreamers. Instead, it offers three-year renewable legal status for a smaller subset of immigrants who were DACA recipients.\n\nThe proposals also differ on who would qualify, potentially expanding protections for more than the 1.8 million immigrants who were eligible for DACA. A narrow bipartisan Senate plan, introduced by John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, includes more expansive thresholds for qualification, potentially expanding the number of eligible immigrants to 3.2 million. This plan was voted down Thursday.\n\nIn 2001, the Dream Act was introduced to provide a pathway to citizenship for these immigrants without additional immigration measures. Democrats still favor that approach, but it does not have enough support in the Republican-controlled Congress.\n\nBorder Wall\n\nNO MONEY MORE MONEY Limited funding for a border wall No funding for a border wall More funding for a border wall NO MONEY MORE MONEY Limited funding for a border wall No funding for a border wall More funding for a border wall\n\nMr. Trump has called for full funding, an estimated $25 billion over 10 years, to fulfill his campaign promise to build a wall along the southern border with Mexico, which Democrats have generally opposed. The White House plan has been introduced as legislation by Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa. It would appropriate $25 billion for a border security trust fund, of which $18 billion would go toward a wall and other physical barriers. It was also voted down Thursday.\n\nThe House Republican plan \u201cauthorizes\u201d about $25 billion for border security, designating $9.3 billion of that for physical barriers like a wall. An authorization is a step taken before an \u201cappropriation,\u201d which is actual funding.\n\nSmall amount of money More money No money Proposal by: House Republicans White House Senator Flake Gang of Six McCain-Coons Common Sense Coalition The Senate voted down the proposals in yellow. Small amount of money More money No money Proposal by: House Republicans White House Senator Flake Gang of Six McCain-Coons Common Sense Coalition The Senate voted down the proposals in yellow.\n\nThe Common Sense Coalition, a bipartisan group of senators led by Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, released a proposal late Wednesday that would appropriate $25 billion for border security overall. On Thursday, the White House released a statement saying that if that plan came to the president\u2019s desk, \u201chis advisors would recommend that he veto it.\u201d Later, the Senate voted against a motion to advance the plan.\n\nA compromise plan developed by Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, addresses the White House\u2019s four priorities, including $25 billion for a border security trust fund.\n\nThe Gang of Six plan would appropriate a total of just $1.6 billion for a border wall. A similar plan has been introduced in the House by the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus.\n\nOther Border Security\n\nLESS AGGRESSIVE MORE AGGRESSIVE Significant funding for border security Limited funding for border security Significant funding for border security and new bio-metric exit-entry system LESS AGGRESSIVE MORE AGGRESSIVE Limited funding for border security Significant funding for border security Significant funding for border security and new bio-metric exit-entry system\n\nRepublicans want to beef up security along the border as a condition for other reforms. The House Republican plan takes the most aggressive approach, including a new biometric entry-exit system \u201cat all air, land, and sea ports of entry,\u201d with a $15.7 billion authorization for border security on top of money for a wall.\n\nLimited funding More funding Most aggressive Proposal by: House Republicans White House Senator Flake Gang of Six McCain-Coons Common Sense Coalition The Senate voted down the proposals in yellow. Limited funding More funding Most aggressive Proposal by: House Republicans White House Senator Flake Gang of Six McCain-Coons Common Sense Coalition The Senate voted down the proposals in yellow.\n\nThe narrow McCain-Coons plan authorizes (but would not appropriate) a small amount of money ($550 million over 10 years) for border security. That plan is nearly identical to a House bill that has more than 50 bipartisan co-sponsors, but it is not likely to have enough Republican support to pass.\n\nEven the most expensive plans fall short of the border security funding included in the 2013 immigration bill that was passed in the Senate but was never taken up in the House. That compromise bill devoted roughly $40 billion to border security. In exchange, the bill also included a path to citizenship for all 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, with an expedited path for Dreamers.\n\nInterior Enforcement\n\nSTATUS QUO MORE ENFORCEMENT Heavier enforcement of immigration laws No increased enforcement of immigration laws Heavier enforcement of immigration laws, crack down on sanctuary cities, implement E-Verify STATUS QUO MORE ENFORCEMENT Heavier enforcement of immigration laws No increased enforcement of immigration laws Heavier enforcement of immigration laws, crack down on sanctuary cities, implement E-Verify\n\nMr. Trump, along with hard-line Republicans, wants to crack down on unauthorized immigrants with more arrests and faster deportations. The White House plan introduces harsher criminal penalties for deported criminals who re-enter the country and expands the criminal activities that would result in removal for unauthorized immigrants.\n\nThe House Republican plan includes many of the same provisions but goes further. It would implement mandatory E-Verify systems for employers, authorize the Justice Department to crack down on so-called sanctuary cities and make visa overstays a federal misdemeanor.\n\nA separate vote to advance an amendment that would withhold federal grants from sanctuary cities failed in the Senate on Thursday. Four Democrats joined the Republicans in supporting it, but they did not reach the 60 votes needed to proceed.\n\nStatus quo Heavier enforcement Most aggressive enforcement Proposal by: House Republicans White House Senator Flake Gang of Six McCain-Coons Common Sense Coalition The Senate voted down the proposals in yellow. Most aggressive enforcement Status quo Heavier enforcement Proposal by: House Republicans White House Senator Flake Gang of Six McCain-Coons Common Sense Coalition The Senate voted down the proposals in yellow.\n\nNone of the other major plans include increased interior enforcement measures.\n\nFamily-Based Migration\n\nSTATUS QUO FEWER VISAS Scale back family-based migration and reallocate visas No change to current visa system Scale back family-based migration and not reallocate visas STATUS QUO FEWER VISAS Scale back family-based migration and reallocate visas No change to current visa system Scale back family-based migration and not reallocate visas\n\nAnother one of the administration\u2019s four priorities is ending \u201cchain migration\u201d \u2014 migration that allows legal immigrants to sponsor extended family members.\n\nThe hard-line plans by the White House and by House Republicans would limit family-based migration to spouses and children and would not reallocate those visas (or would only reallocate a limited number), resulting in less legal immigration over all.\n\nStatus quo Redistribute visas Fewer visas Proposal by: House Republicans White House Senator Flake Gang of Six McCain-Coons Common Sense Coalition The Senate voted down the proposals in yellow. Status quo Redistribute visas Fewer visas Proposal by: House Republicans White House Senator Flake Gang of Six McCain-Coons Common Sense Coalition The Senate voted down the proposals in yellow.\n\nOther plans, from the bipartisan Gang of Six and Senator Flake, also limit family-based migration to spouses and children but redistribute the remaining visas to highly educated and skilled workers or qualifying family.\n\nThe Common Sense Coalition plan prohibits green card holders from sponsoring adult children. The McCain-Coons plan does not make changes to the visa system.\n\nDiversity Visa Lottery\n\nSTATUS QUO FEWER VISAS End diversity lottery and reallocate visas No change to current diversity lottery visa system End diversity lottery and not reallocate visas STATUS QUO FEWER VISAS End diversity lottery and reallocate visas No change to current diversity lottery visa system End diversity lottery and not reallocate visas\n\nLike the family-based migration changes, ending the diversity visa program is a priority of the Trump administration. The White House plan and the House Republican plan would eliminate the program without redistributing its visas. The Migration Policy Institute, a research organization, estimates that both plans would result in a drop of 30 percent in legal immigration because of their family-based visa and diversity lottery provisions.\n\nStatus quo Redistribute visas Fewer visas Proposal by: House Republicans White House Senator Flake Gang of Six McCain-Coons Common Sense Coalition The Senate voted down the proposals in yellow. Status quo Redistribute visas Fewer visas Proposal by: House Republicans White House Senator Flake Gang of Six McCain-Coons Common Sense Coalition The Senate voted down the proposals in yellow.\n\nUnder Senator Flake\u2019s plan, diversity lottery visas would be partially reallocated, but the number available would eventually drop off. The Gang of Six plan would also end the program, but would redistribute all of the visas, with some going to vulnerable populations that are in the country under Temporary Protected Status.", "keywords": ["dreamers", "tied", "senator", "white", "gop", "plan", "senate", "gang", "house", "visas", "demands", "immigration", "funding", "fate", "border", "wall", "republicans"], "polarity": 0.050340349305866554, "subjectivity": 0.3455140426076389},

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/us/politics/epa-pollution-loophole-glider-trucks.html", "text": "\u201cThis just does not make any sense to me,\u201d said Christine Todd Whitman, who served as head of the E.P.A. during the first George W. Bush administration. \u201cEverybody breathes the same air, Democrats or Republicans. It does not matter. This is about keeping people healthy.\u201d\n\nBut the Fitzgerald family has had influential allies. In addition to Mr. Pruitt, they include Representative Diane Black, a Republican who is a candidate for Tennessee governor, and Tennessee Technological University, a state university that produced a study minimizing pollution problems associated with the trucks.\n\nMs. Black introduced legislation in 2015 to protect the loophole when it was first in line to be eliminated by a stricter diesel emissions rule under the Obama administration. That bill failed, but after the election of Mr. Trump, she turned to Mr. Pruitt to carve out an exemption to the new rule \u2014 scheduled to take effect last month \u2014 and presented him with the study from Tennessee Tech.\n\nFitzgerald had not only paid for the study, which has roiled the faculty at Tennessee Tech and is the subject of an internal investigation, but it had also offered to build a new research center for the university on land owned by the company. And in the six weeks before Mr. Pruitt announced in November that he would grant the exemption, Fitzgerald business entities, executives and family members contributed at least $225,000 to Ms. Black\u2019s campaign for governor, campaign disclosure records show.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe multiple donors allowed the company to circumvent a Tennessee state law intended to limit the size of campaign contributions by corporations and political action committees. The donations \u2014 many of which came through a series of limited liability companies tied to the family \u2014 represented 12 percent of the money Ms. Black had raised from outside sources through last month, the records show.\n\nTommy Fitzgerald, an owner of Fitzgerald, said the actions by Ms. Black and Mr. Pruitt were good public policy and not special favors to his company.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why anyone would want to kill all these jobs,\u201d Mr. Fitzgerald said, referring to the several hundred people he said he employs at his dealerships, many of them in rural areas. \u201cIt does not make any sense.\u201d\n\nChris Hartline, a spokesman for Ms. Black, said the congresswoman had stood up for a constituent and was not influenced by the campaign donations, which he said complied with state law. \u201cThere are very few companies willing to try and keep manufacturing jobs in rural Tennessee today, and Diane fights hard to support the few that do,\u201d Mr. Hartline said.\n\nAn E.P.A. spokeswoman, Liz Bowman, said that Mr. Pruitt remained committed to protecting clean air. But, she said, he agreed with a legal argument made by Ms. Black and Fitzgerald that the agency did not have the authority to limit sales.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cE.P.A. is acting on behalf of anyone who sees merit in upholding and perhaps even bolstering the credibility of our laws and the role of Congress,\u201d Ms. Bowman said.\n\nShe said that the money donated to Ms. Black had no impact on the decision by Mr. Pruitt.\n\nNew Trucks, Old Engines\n\nThe trucks sold by Fitzgerald are known as \u201cgliders\u201d because they are manufactured without engines and are later retrofitted with the rebuilt ones. Gliders are popular among small trucking companies and individual truck owners, who say they cannot afford to buy or operate vehicles with new engines and modern emissions controls.\n\nThe trucks, which Fitzgerald claims burn less fuel per mile and are cheaper to repair, have been on the market since at least the 1970s. But after the federal government moved to force improvements in truck emissions, with standards that were first enacted during the Clinton administration and took full effect by 2010, gliders became a way for trucking companies to legally skirt the rules.\n\nDealers like Fitzgerald buy truck bodies from Peterbilt, Freightliner and other manufacturers and typically install 1990s-era engines, recovered from salvage yards, that its employees rebuild down to their cores. The used engines and other remanufactured parts allow dealers to claim that the new trucks predate emissions requirements, and therefore should be exempt.\n\nNationally, an estimated 10,000 glider trucks were sold in 2015 \u2014 or about 4 percent of all new heavy-duty truck sales \u2014 the last full year for which data is available, up from fewer than 1,000 in 2010. Fitzgerald is the industry\u2019s largest dealer in retrofitting the trucks by selling so-called glider kit trucks, for about $130,000. Modern trucks, which also include collision avoidance equipment, cost between $145,000 and $170,000, dealers said.\n\n\u201cI hate government mandates,\u201d said Paul Bailey, a state senator and the operations manager at CB Trucking in Cookeville, Tenn., which hauls everything from building supplies to mustard in its fleet of 60 glider trucks, two-thirds of which were purchased from Fitzgerald.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe glider trucks take advantage of other regulatory loopholes. Since most of the engines were manufactured before 1999, the trucks are exempt from a federal law that went into effect in December intended to prevent accidents caused by fatigued drivers. The law requires commercial truck drivers to use an electronic logging system to track how many hours they spend behind the wheel, and to take mandatory breaks. The law covers truck engines manufactured after 1999.\n\nThe glider trucks, in some cases, also are not subject to a 12 percent federal excise tax imposed on truck sales, because they are not considered new trucks. Ms. Black intervened with the Internal Revenue Service last year, along with three other members of Congress, to protect that tax break.\n\nA Fitzgerald salesman boasted last week that all 150 trucks on the company\u2019s Crossville lot had been sold as trucking companies rushed to avoid the Obama-era emissions standards and the electronic tracking rule.\n\n\u201cWe cannot build them quick enough,\u201d said the salesman, Cody Poston. A second Fitzgerald salesman said the company had pending customer orders for 300 more and had about 2,000 glider trucks on the way to his sales lot.\n\nPhoto\n\nMatt Moorehead, who helps maintain trucks at the CB Trucking garage in Cookeville, said glider trucks allow small companies and individual drivers to compete with big trucking companies.\n\nHe said the trucks are easier to repair and, by some accounts, burn less diesel fuel per mile. And by avoiding the electronic tracking system, drivers can continue to use paper logs, which can be more easily manipulated to allow flexibility in driving and rest times.\n\n\u201cWhen you got a load of eggs and milk to deliver, these rules can force you to stop driving when you are just a few miles short of your destination,\u201d he said of the electronic tracking.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter E.P.A. officials, during the Obama administration, saw a surge in the number of glider trucks being sold, the agency moved to prohibit any company from manufacturing more than 300 of them per year, effectively killing the industry that had emerged to help sidestep the rules.\n\nFitzgerald, with Ms. Black\u2019s help, submitted a petition in July asking Mr. Pruitt to suspend the cap and declare that all gliders made by Fitzgerald and at least two other dealers \u2014 Iowa-based Harrison Truck Centers and Indiana Phoenix of Avilla, Ind. \u2014 be exempted because the new emissions requirements applied only to \u201cnew motor vehicle engines.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nTo bolster their argument, Fitzgerald submitted the study conducted by Tennessee Tech in late 2016. The study, which Mr. Pruitt cited in the E.P.A.\u2019s November announcement of the rollback, concluded that emissions from the company\u2019s trucks were as clean as those with modern systems.\n\nThe push by Fitzgerald had started by May, according to a calendar of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s visitors, when Mr. Pruitt and his chief of staff met with executives from Fitzgerald and Donald Shandy, an Oklahoma lawyer who knows Mr. Pruitt from his tenure as Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general.\n\nBy September, to keep the momentum going, Fitzgerald had hired its first full-time federal lobbyist \u2014 a former aide to Ms. Black.\n\n\u2018Super-Polluting Trucks\u2019\n\nTerry Dotson, president of Worldwide Equipment Enterprises, a Kentucky-based chain of truck dealerships that sells vehicles with modern emissions controls, said he remembered going into repair garages years ago when it was hard to breathe because of soot.\n\nMr. Dotson says he voted for President Trump and is a strong backer of the coal industry, which relies on his trucks for mining operations. But he does not agree with the administration\u2019s carve-out for glider trucks.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI want Mr. Fitzgerald to make a fortune and be a happy man,\u201d Mr. Dotson said outside one of his Knoxville, Tenn., dealerships. \u201cBut everybody ought to play by the same set of rules.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTruck manufacturers, as well as shipping companies like UPS, fear that a permanent loophole would encourage other truck dealers to enter the glider business, further undermining efforts to reduce health hazards associated with diesel exhaust and creating unfair competition for them. The National Association of Clean Air Agencies, representing state regulators, and the attorneys general from 12 states have joined in protesting the rollback.\n\nChet France, former director of assessment and standards at the E.P.A. Office of Transportation and Air Quality, says there are enough truck engines in salvage yards to support the glider market for decades.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about super-polluting trucks that are going to put the health of thousands of people at risk,\u201d said Mr. France, who worked at the E.P.A. for 30 years under Democratic and Republican administrations and is a consultant to the Environmental Defense Fund. \u201cAnd for what?\u201d\n\nThe E.P.A. estimates that over the life of every 10,000 trucks without modern emissions systems, up to 1,600 Americans would die prematurely, and thousands more would suffer a variety of ailments including bronchitis and heart attacks, particularly in cities with air pollution associated with diesel-powered trains, ships and power plants.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe health threats are caused by nitrogen oxide and tiny particles of dust and soot that create haze in the air.\n\nIn November, just days after Mr. Pruitt said he would eliminate the glider cap, staff members at the E.P.A. submitted an analysis to the agency\u2019s rule-making docket that contradicted the conclusions from Fitzgerald and Tennessee Tech that glider trucks created no more pollution than trucks with updated emissions systems.\n\nThe analysis said E.P.A. tests found that the Fitzgerald trucks emitted nitrogen oxide levels during highway operations that were 43 times as high as those from trucks with modern emissions control systems. The air pollution from these glider trucks was so bad that one year\u2019s worth of truck sales was estimated to release 13 times as much nitrogen oxide as all of the Volkswagen diesel cars with fraudulent emissions controls, a scheme that resulted in a criminal case against the company and more than $4 billion in fines.\n\nWhen testing the glider trucks in stop-and-go traffic, the E.P.A. report said, the testing equipment shut down because of the extreme level of particulates.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe filters were overloaded with particulate matter,\u201d said the report, which included a photograph of the white filter that had turned pitch black.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn recent weeks, other questions have been raised about the accuracy of the Tennessee Tech study, the role engineering experts at the university played in it, and the relationship between Fitzgerald and the university.\n\nThe signature of Tennessee Tech\u2019s president, Philip B. Oldham, appeared on the study, which was included in the petition Fitzgerald submitted in July to eliminate the cap. In April, Mr. Oldham was photographed with Mr. Fitzgerald at the Bristol Motor Speedway in Tennessee, where Fitzgerald sponsors the Fitzgerald Glider Kits 300, a Nascar Xfinity Series stock car race. Mr. Oldham presided over an event at the university in August, where Fitzgerald announced it would build a new academic research center for the university.\n\nSome faculty members say the university appears to have been used by Fitzgerald as part of its lobbying campaign.\n\n\u201cOur reputation has recently been damaged because of a study funded by Fitzgerald Glider Kits and used to influence federal policy,\u201d said a faculty senate resolution passed late last month. Christy Killman, president of the faculty senate, said the results of the study \u201craised a red flag.\u201d\n\nMr. Oldham did not respond to a request for comment, but he sent a letter to Ms. Killman this month confirming that a \u201cmisconduct in research\u201d investigation had been started, at the faculty\u2019s request, adding that he wanted to ensure the university\u2019s reputation as an \u201chonest broker of knowledge.\u201d\n\nThe public comment period on Mr. Pruitt\u2019s intention to repeal the annual cap on glider trucks has passed. Ms. Bowman, the E.P.A. spokeswoman, says the agency is now reviewing the comments before Mr. Pruitt announces a final decision.\n\n\u201cContinuing to improve air quality is a stated priority of Administrator Pruitt\u2019s,\u201d Ms. Bowman said. \u201cAny comments received that raise concerns with the ability to maintain that goal are closely considered and analyzed.\u201d\n\nAt Fitzgerald\u2019s sales lot, employees said last week that there was no need to worry about pollution from the trucks, adding that they had emissions test results to prove it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey are just as clean,\u201d Mr. Poston said of the gliders, compared with modern trucks, \u201cif not cleaner.\u201d", "keywords": ["trumps", "fitzgerald", "glider", "secure", "help", "epa", "ms", "pollution", "mr", "tennessee", "trucks", "emissions", "loophole", "pruitt", "truck", "225000"], "polarity": 0.048188334962528515, "subjectivity": 0.37268291207000875},

But they could include both sanctions against Russian officials involved in the attack and covert measures \u2014 any of which would be likely to fray an already fragile relationship.\n\nThe administration\u2019s public statement echoed one in mid-December when it publicly blamed North Korea for a damaging ransomware attack known as Wannacry. In that case, however, the United States did not follow up with stiff penalties, in part because North Korea was already under heavy sanctions for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has used just about every lever you can use, short of starving the people of North Korea, to change their behavior,\u201d the homeland security adviser, Thomas P.

Cybersecurity researchers estimate that criminals made more than $1 billion through these attacks last year, with victims ranging from the chief executives of major companies to small businesses and private individuals.\n\nWhile the motive for many ransomware attacks is financial, Russia\u2019s involvement suggests it was part of a broader strategy to destabilize Ukraine that dates back to Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Azar II, the new secretary of health and human services, said Thursday that he would closely scrutinize a plan by Idaho to allow the sale of insurance that does not comply with the Affordable Care Act, an early test of how he will enforce a law he opposes.\n\nBut he said it was too early to know what action he might take.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be looking at that very carefully and measure it up against the standards of the law,\u201d Mr. Azar said at a hearing of the Senate Finance Committee.\n\nDemocrats in Congress, as well as the American Cancer Society and other groups representing patients, say the Idaho plan would allow insurers to discriminate against people with pre-existing medical conditions, in defiance of the federal law.\n\nImage Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said Thursday that Idaho\u2019s plan would move health insurance \u201cback to yesteryear, when insurers could beat the stuffing out of people with pre-existing conditions.\u201d Credit Lawrence Jackson for The New York Times\n\nSenator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, said Idaho would allow the sale of \u201cjunk insurance,\u201d and he asserted that the state was moving \u201cback to yesteryear, when insurers could beat the stuffing out of people with pre-existing conditions.\u201d\n\nThe plan presents Mr. Azar with a choice that he could face frequently in his new job: whether to try to shore up the health law or to \u201clet Obamacare fail,\u201d as President Trump has threatened to do. His decisions could have significant consequences both for consumers and for Republicans in the midterm elections.\n\nMr. Azar said he had seen news reports of Idaho\u2019s plan, but did not know the details because the state had not asked the federal government for a waiver of requirements in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut Mr. Wyden said that \u201cIdaho is breaking a federal law\u201d and was not seeking permission from the federal government.\n\nAt a separate hearing on Thursday before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Representative Frank Pallone Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, said the Trump administration was \u201csitting on the sidelines while Idaho clearly circumvents the law.\u201d\n\nMr. Azar described Idaho\u2019s plan as \u201ca cry for help\u201d by a state seeking more affordable coverage options for its residents. He said the Idaho program would be subject to \u201csearching review for compliance\u201d with federal law.\n\n\u201cWe have a duty to enforce the law as Congress has written it,\u201d Mr. Azar said. But he added that the federal government must proceed with \u201ca great deal of deliberation and caution and care\u201d in assessing the Idaho plan.\n\nAt three congressional hearings in 36 hours this week, Mr. Azar also explained his portion of Mr. Trump\u2019s budget, which seeks $1.1 trillion for the Department of Health and Human Services in the fiscal year that starts on Oct. 1.\n\nSenator Michael D. Crapo, Republican of Idaho, defended his state\u2019s plan to allow the sale of noncompliant coverage. Idaho\u2019s goal, he said, is \u201cto protect and expand the opportunities and access people have to insurance of their choice.\u201d\n\nIdaho residents will still be able to obtain coverage that complies with the Affordable Care Act on the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, Mr. Crapo said. But Idaho will allow other options, outside the exchange.\n\nThe Republican governor of Idaho, C. L. Otter, known as Butch, issued an executive order last month to combat what he called \u201cthe overreaching, intrusive nature of Obamacare.\u201d And on Jan. 24, the state Insurance Department issued guidelines for the sale of insurance policies that do not meet coverage requirements of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIdaho\u2019s new \u201cstate-based health benefit plans\u201d will have to carry a disclaimer: \u201cThe policy is not fully compliant with federal health insurance requirements.\u201d\n\nInsurers in Idaho could, in some cases, charge different rates based on a person\u2019s health status or claims experience. In addition, insurers would not have to comply with provisions of the federal law limiting out-of-pocket costs, and they could impose caps on the dollar amount of benefits available to consumers.\n\nDean L. Cameron, the director of the Idaho Department of Insurance, said in an interview on Thursday that insurers could start selling the new state-based health plans as early as April.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to salvage the market,\u201d Mr. Cameron said. \u201cThe young and healthy people of all ages have left the market. We are trying to bring them back. Our goal is to help Idaho families.\u201d\n\nBlue Cross of Idaho said this week that it would offer five such plans. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act marketplace has become unaffordable for Idaho\u2019s middle-class uninsured,\u201d the company said, and it told consumers that the new plans could cost \u201cup to 50 percent less\u201d than plans that comply with the federal law.\n\nMr. Azar, a former top executive at Eli Lilly and Company, the drug maker, deftly fielded questions about prescription drugs. He said the president\u2019s budget included \u201ca suite of proposals\u201d that would save Medicare beneficiaries money \u2014 for example, by capping their out-of-pocket costs for many prescription drugs and by giving them the benefit of price concessions negotiated by insurers and prescription drug plans.\n\nDemocrats were not impressed.\n\n\u201cNone of the policies go after the pharmaceutical industry, your former employer,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio.\n\nMr. Azar said Medicaid, the program for more than 70 million low-income people, was full of perverse incentives that tended to drive up drug costs. Under federal law, Medicaid is generally entitled to the best price given to other purchasers of brand-name prescription drugs, with a mandatory discount of at least 23 percent off the list price.\n\nMr. Azar agreed with Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, who said these discounts led drug makers to raise prices for other customers.\n\n\u201cIf we underpay in Medicaid, it will increase costs elsewhere,\u201d Mr. Azar said.\n\nMembers of both parties expressed concern about Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to cut $48 billion over 10 years from projected federal payments to teaching hospitals for graduate medical education.\n\nMr. Azar said the administration wanted to direct funds to geographic areas and medical specialties with the greatest need for more doctors.\n\nBut Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, said the proposed cut would \u201cseverely hurt a state like ours, a growth state, that desperately needs residency programs to keep our doctors.\u201d\n\nSign Up for the Morning Briefing Get what you need to know to start your day in the United States, Canada and the Americas, delivered to your inbox.

This could get broad bipartisan support.\u201d\n\nMr. Grassley\u2019s attempt to revive the legislation has slowly been gaining momentum in recent months, though it has attracted little of the fanfare that accompanied the previous effort. Thursday\u2019s vote, for example, was eclipsed by a high-stakes debate consuming the Senate over the nation\u2019s immigration laws.\n\nA small group of Republicans on the committee, including Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, opposed the bill. Mr. Cornyn was one of the foremost advocates of similar legislation in the last Congress, but he has come to believe that a narrower set of changes to prisons is more realistic than a sweeping sentencing overhaul.\n\nMr. Grassley\u2019s legislation, which so far has the support of more than 20 Democrats and Republicans, would significantly reduce mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenses and institute a new system for determining which offenders would be eligible for early release. It would also create programs to better prepare them to return to life out of prison.\n\n\u201cMandatory minimum sentences were once seen as a strong deterrent,\u201d Senator Richard J. Durbin, the lead Democratic author, said in a statement after the vote. \u201cIn reality they have too often been unfair, fiscally irresponsible and a threat to public safety.\u201d\n\nThe plan has support from groups as ideologically diverse as the billionaire conservatives Charles G. and David H. Koch and the American Civil Liberties Union, and its authors expect it could easily win majorities in both chambers of Congress if given a vote.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut it runs against the prevailing philosophy of the Trump administration and, in particular, the Justice Department under Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Mr. Sessions, who was instrumental in derailing the 2015 effort when he was still in the Senate, has ordered federal prosecutors to pursue the toughest possible charges and sentences for crime suspects, reversing Obama-era efforts to ease such penalties for some nonviolent drug offenders. Many Republicans in the House and Senate agree with that philosophy.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe conflict was laid bare on Wednesday when Mr. Sessions wrote a letter to Mr. Grassley calling the bill \u201ca grave error\u201d that would put more dangerous criminals back on the streets and tie up resources needed to fight violent crime and gang action.\n\n\u201cPassing this legislation to further reduce sentences for drug traffickers in the midst of the worst drug crisis in our nation\u2019s history would make it more difficult to achieve our goals and have potentially dire consequences,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe letter pushed Mr. Grassley, who has shouldered the legislation for three years, into a rare fury. He wrote on Twitter that he was \u201cincensed\u201d and told reporters that he resented the attorney general trying to tell a senator \u2014 especially one who guided his confirmation proceedings despite Democratic support \u2014 how to write the law.\n\n\u201cDo you realize that he\u2019s carrying out laws? He\u2019s no longer a senator,\u201d Mr. Grassley said. \u201cThat letter sounds just exactly like he still thinks he\u2019s a senator.\u201d\n\nHolly Harris, the executive director of the Justice Action Network, a bipartisan coalition advocating an overhaul, said that urgency had only grown since 2015, largely because of the opioid crisis that has ravaged communities across the country.\n\n\u201cCriminal justice reform is only controversial in one place in this country, and that\u2019s Washington, D.C.,\u201d she said, urging Republican leaders to move forward with the bill.\n\n\u201cThere is a high expectation across the country that Republicans will be supportive of these reforms,\u201d she added. \u201cAny effort by the opposition will not be well received not just by progressives but by conservatives, as well.\u201d", "keywords": ["senates", "grassley", "senator", "support", "hits", "sentencing", "roadblock", "overhaul", "push", "sentences", "senate", "drug", "bipartisan", "mr", "legislation", "republicans", "familiar", "renewed"], "polarity": 0.0872079696260024, "subjectivity": 0.5152235469448584},

It cited laws enacted by Congress in 2001 and 2002 to authorize using military force against the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 attacks and Saddam Hussein-era Iraq, saying they cover the Islamic State. That theory was first put forward by the Obama administration and has been disputed, but no court has ruled on whether it is correct.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s court filing also backstopped that theory by claiming that President Trump, as commander in chief, wields inherent constitutional authority, independent of any act of Congress, to detain wartime enemies when they are captured on a battlefield where American forces are fighting.\n\nThat claim recalled sweeping assertions of executive power made by the George W.

Mr. Trump requested to speak to the king, whom he then asked for help in dealing with the aggrieved president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nThere are no signs that Mr. Abbas is softening. The Palestinians broke ties with the administration in December, after Mr. Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital and announced plans to move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv. They complained bitterly that the United States had forfeited its role as a credible broker between them and the Israelis.\n\nTheir fury only deepened when Mr. Trump declared last month at a meeting with Mr. Netanyahu that he had taken Jerusalem \u201coff the table.\u201d Palestinians have long aspired to have East Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state. Mr. Abbas set off on a tour of world capitals, including Moscow, to see whether he could find another leader for the peace process.\n\nAdministration officials said they were confident that the Palestinians would recognize their lack of options and return to the fold eventually. But after swinging so heavily toward Israel, they also seem to realize the need to restore a semblance of balance to the statements made by administration officials.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s tone first changed on Sunday, when he told a right-wing newspaper, Israel Hayom, that he was concerned about the growth of Jewish settlements on the West Bank. \u201cSettlements,\u201d he said, \u201care something that very much complicates and always have complicated making peace.\u201d\n\nAsked what he meant by \u201ctaking Jerusalem off the table,\u201d the president said, \u201cJerusalem is the capital of Israel, and as for specific boundaries, I would support what both sides agreed to\u201d \u2014 language drafted by Mr. Greenblatt to keep open at least the veneer of a negotiated settlement.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump criticized the Palestinians for \u201cnot looking to make peace,\u201d he added, \u201cI am not necessarily sure that Israel is looking to make peace.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump has issued statements like those before, but officials noted that in this case, he was making them to a Hebrew-language paper read by the Israeli right.

He was trying to head off legislation annexing West Bank territory. But he was also trying to shore up support among hard-line members of his party in advance of the recommendation that he be charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust.\n\nHow those legal travails will affect Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s approach to a peace deal is hard to predict, analysts said, though some said they expected him to emphasize security issues over peacemaking for the next few months \u2014 a strategy that could lead to further friction with Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cThe rebuke of Bibi is quite unprecedented in the annals of the Trump-Bibi relationship,\u201d said Martin S.

But Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Trump, said the first lady \u201chad no involvement\u201d with the inaugural committee \u201cand had no knowledge of how funds were spent.\u201d\n\nMs. Winston Wolkoff is not paid for her work in the first lady\u2019s office, according to Ms. Grisham, who said Ms. Winston Wolkoff is classified as \u201ca special government employee\u201d and \u201chas specified duties as outlined in her contract.\u201d\n\nSpecial government employees are a category of federal worker created to allow the government the flexibility to hire specialists to fill discrete roles, usually on a temporary basis.\n\nMs. Grisham did not respond to follow-up questions about the particulars of Ms. Winston Wolkoff\u2019s work in the first lady\u2019s office, or her relationship with Mrs. Trump. Ms. Winston Wolkoff could not be reached for comment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Barrack praised Ms. Winston Wolkoff, saying she \u201cexecuted her duties well.\u201d\n\nBut Craig Holman, an official with the government watchdog group Public Citizen, which had called on the inaugural committee to release more details about its finances sooner, described the payments to Ms. Winston Wolkoff\u2019s firm and other expenditures as \u201cfiscal mismanagement at its worst.\u201d\n\nMuch of the money paid to Ms. Winston Wolkoff\u2019s firm and other event production companies was probably passed through to other vendors who provided goods or services on a subcontractor basis.\n\nAn operative who worked with the inaugural committee, who was not authorized to speak for attribution about its spending, said Ms. Winston Wolkoff\u2019s firm handled everything from securing venues and table settings to arranging Instagram filters and satellite feeds, as well as the transportation of heavy equipment. The operative said Ms. Winston Wolkoff personally received $1.62 million for her work.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

David Monn of New York, who also is known for orchestrating society events and planned a state dinner for former President Barack Obama, was paid $3.7 million, which the operative said was primarily to plan two events, one of which was billed as a \u201ccandlelight dinner\u201d attended by Mr. and Mrs. Trump, and Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen Pence.\n\nThe committee spent heavily on administrative expenses, including $9.4 million on travel, $500,000 on legal fees, $237,000 on fund-raising and $4.6 million on salaries and benefits for its 208 employees. That included $100,000 paid to Rick Gates, the former Trump campaign aide, who has since been indicted on a host of charges by the special counsel investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, according to the operative who worked with the inaugural committee.\n\nMr. Barrack, a California real estate investor, picked Mr. Gates to help lead the committee\u2019s efforts. But many people with long experience in Republican politics remained wary of Mr. Trump as the inauguration approached, and did not get involved with the committee.\n\nThe inaugural committee official said wrap-up costs were more significant than had been anticipated, and indicated that the committee\u2019s finances were affected by its lack of a large deal for broadcast rights to the inaugural balls. But its brisk fund-raising \u2014 the $107 million it raised was about twice as much as Mr. Obama\u2019s inaugural committee raised for the festivities around his 2009 swearing-in \u2014 allowed it to cover all its costs.\n\nThe inaugural committee closed out October with $2.8 million in the bank, according to the tax filing. It indicated in the release that the remaining funds also would be donated to charity once remaining expenses are paid.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe tax return indicated that the committee already donated to six nonprofit groups, and inaugural officials pointed out that the $5 million in total charitable donations to those groups was more than Mr. Obama\u2019s committee donated.\n\nAmong the recipients of charitable donations, the White House Historical Association received $1 million, while the Vice President\u2019s Residence Foundation, which is devoted to decorating and furnishing the vice president\u2019s residence on the grounds of the Naval Observatory in Washington, received $750,000.\n\nThe American Red Cross, the Salvation Army and Samaritan\u2019s Purse, an evangelical group, received $1 million each. All three groups were involved in relief efforts after a string of hurricanes that ravaged the Gulf Coast, Florida and the Caribbean.\n\nAs questions mounted last summer about the inaugural committee\u2019s finances and pledged charitable donations, Mr. Barrack released a statement promising that \u201cmillions of dollars of reserve funds will be allocated to various charities, institutions and foundations in an amount that surely will exceed any previous inauguration.\u201d\n\nThe inaugural committee split the costs of staging a range of festivities with the taxpayer-funded Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies and various federal, state and local government agencies. Security costs alone were predicted to surpass $100 million, which will eventually be paid for by the federal government.\n\nAmong the top donors to Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural committee were the Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon G. Adelson, who donated $5 million, and corporations including Chevron, Boeing and AT&T.\n\nThe committee had previously filed a mandatory report with the Federal Election Commission listing its donors, and the donor names were omitted from the I.R.S. filing released Thursday. The bulk of the report \u2014 about 90 pages \u2014 comprised a list of donation amounts without the identities of the donors.", "keywords": ["trumps", "million", "26", "firm", "ladys", "paid", "committee", "winston", "wolkoffs", "ms", "inaugural", "adviser", "mr", "trump", "wolkoff"], "polarity": 0.08749826562326561, "subjectivity": 0.3571599696599697},

That issue could be a political problem for those Democrats up for re-election in conservative states.\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, initially blocked that effort, saying Mr. McConnell was starting off on the wrong foot.\n\n\u201cThe majority leader\u2019s desire to vote on an unrelated, partisan immigration bill \u2014 legislation that is not only silent on Dreamers, but is silent on border security as well \u2014 is not a productive way to begin debate,\u201d Mr. Schumer said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Republicans were not interested in the Democratic maneuver.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe standoff left the Senate right where it has been for years \u2014 frozen by a deep reluctance on the part of leaders of both parties to force vulnerable incumbents to take politically challenging votes. That thinking has dried up floor debate and put tight restrictions on the movement of legislation, making it a central cause of congressional gridlock.\n\nIn 2014, Republicans could not get enough of pointing out that Senator Mark Begich, a first-term Democrat from Alaska, never had a single amendment he wrote voted on by the Senate, a fact they said highlighted a lack of influence. He lost his re-election bid.\n\nThe refusal to battle it out over amendments has frustrated lawmakers in both parties and left some strategists scratching their heads because they see little evidence that such votes are all that damaging in an environment where charges and countercharges fly freely.\n\n\u201cWhat I came here to do is vote,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. \u201cAnd I am chagrined that we are in a time when both sides seem in trepidation of voting because our political process has become so polarized.\u201d\n\nThis fight was supposed to be different. After provoking a brief government shutdown last month, Democrats agreed to support the necessary spending to reopen federal agencies in exchange for a promise from Mr. McConnell that he would allow a no-holds-barred debate on immigration policy. It fell short of the demand by Democrats for a solution to the Dreamer issue but offered the party hope that, because of bipartisan sympathy for the immigrants, it could push through a bill and pressure the House to pass it.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut while Mr. McConnell might have promised the debate, he did not promise to make it easy for Democrats. As could have readily been predicted, he backed the most conservative option presented on behalf of the president while trying to ensnare Democrats in tough votes to help preserve his majority in November\u2019s elections.\n\n\u201cMy Democratic colleagues have spent months demanding the Senate take up this issue,\u201d Mr. McConnell said Wednesday. \u201cThey even shut down the government \u2014 unnecessarily, I might add \u2014 in order to secure this very week of debate. But now that the time has come to make law instead of just making points, they\u2019re stalling.\u201d\n\nNearly all Democrats and eight Republicans ultimately got behind a compromise plan that would protect Dreamers but prevent parents who brought them into the country from gaining citizenship while diverting $25 billion to border security. It fell six votes short after the White House fought it tooth and nail, leaving the fate of the Dreamers as uncertain as the Senate\u2019s ability to get things done.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat was certain was that the debate many anticipated never occurred in a Senate that hosted storied fights between John C. Calhoun and Daniel Webster over slavery. Stephen A. Douglas and Abraham Lincoln later clashed in a series of remarkable showdowns as they sought the Senate seat from Illinois in 1858, setting Mr. Lincoln up for his presidential election despite his Senate loss.\n\nAnd in October 2008, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware and Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska squared off for the right to preside over the Senate as vice president of the United States. \u201cCan I call you Joe?\u201d Ms. Palin asked in a more memorable moment.\n\nThe confrontation this week loomed as a test of whether the Senate could regain its debate footing and find answers on an issue all agree desperately needs resolution.

One meeting, with Sinclair\u2019s executive chairman, took place days before Mr. Pai, who was appointed by President Trump, took over as F.C.C. chairman.\n\nSinclair\u2019s top lobbyist, a former F.C.C. official, also communicated frequently with former agency colleagues and pushed for the relaxation of media ownership rules.

Mr. Trump has called it a glaring loophole for potentially dangerous immigrants.\n\n\u201cThese conservatives who say they\u2019re so worried about terrorism, this should be a no-brainer,\u201d said Travis Korson, a Republican consultant who is working to push more Republicans to agree on a Dreamer solution.\n\nEvangelical groups are now pressing lawmakers to reach a solution, giving the issue the imprimatur of one of the most important constituencies in the conservative coalition.\n\nIn a letter to Mr. Trump and members of Congress last week, dozens of church leaders called for action. \u201cThe Bible speaks clearly and repeatedly to God\u2019s love and concern for the vulnerable,\u201d they wrote, \u201cand also challenges us to think beyond our nationality, ethnicity or religion when loving our neighbor.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlex Conant, a Republican strategist who was an adviser to Senator Marco Rubio of Florida when Mr. Rubio was pilloried by the right for helping write a comprehensive immigration overhaul in 2013, noted that with Republicans in control of the White House and both houses of Congress, there may not be a better opportunity for years.\n\nMr. Trump, he said, \u201ccould become the first president since Reagan to fix immigration.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cHe has the chance to sign something historic,\u201d Mr. Conant added. \u201cAnd if I were advising him that\u2019s what I\u2019d tell him to do. But I\u2019m not advising him. Stephen Miller is.\u201d (Mr. Miller is the senior policy adviser who, perhaps more than anyone else at the White House, has been a check on the president\u2019s impulses to consider a deal that is less restrictive.)\n\nIn many ways, the Republican Party is still stuck in the same debate it has been having for a generation over law and order versus \u201camnesty,\u201d a generic term many on the right have used to describe plans that would provide legal status or citizenship to anyone here illegally.\n\nIt was not always such a loaded term. Speaking in 1984, President Ronald Reagan described his views this way: \u201cI believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here, even though sometime back they may have entered illegally.\u201d\n\nBut with the election of a president who ran on the most restrictive immigration platform in modern times, the reality for the Republican Party under Mr. Trump is more difficult than it was under Reagan, who still elicits disapproval from conservatives who believe he gave too much away in the immigration overhaul of 1986.\n\n\u201cWe have gone through this before with President Reagan, and we have been suffering the consequences since,\u201d said Jenny Beth Martin, a co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots.\n\n\u201cProve to us that you are worthy of our trust,\u201d she added, \u201cand then come back and talk to us about how we deal with people who are entering this country illegally.\u201d", "keywords": ["gets", "senate", "house", "immigration", "mr", "president", "party", "quiet", "right", "wants", "debate", "trump", "republicans", "republican"], "polarity": 0.05951545067398726, "subjectivity": 0.4340491148417977},

Immigration Demands                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/15/us/politics/immigration-issues-congress-daca.html", "text": "Lawmakers have until March 5 to extend legal protections for Dreamers, the undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. But the battle over their fate has expanded to include other potential changes to the nation\u2019s immigration system, and lawmakers have not come to a consensus.\n\nOn Thursday, the Senate voted to advance three different plans, but each failed.\n\nProposal by: Senate vote to advance (60 needed to pass) House Republicans No vote scheduled White House 39-60 3 Democrats Yes, 14 Republicans No Senator Flake No vote scheduled Gang of Six No vote scheduled McCain-Coons 52-47 4 Republicans Yes, 1 Democrat No Common Sense Coalition 54-45 8 Republicans Yes, 3 Democrats No Senate vote to advance (60 needed to pass) Proposal by: House Republicans No vote scheduled White House 39-60 3 Ds Yes, 14 Rs No Senator Flake No vote scheduled Gang of Six No vote scheduled McCain-Coons 52-47 4 Rs Yes, 1 D No Common Sense Coalition 54-45 8 Rs Yes, 3 Ds No\n\nComplicating matters, President Trump said Wednesday that he would not support a proposal that did not include the \u201cfour pillars\u201d of his own plan: a path to citizenship for Dreamers, a border wall, and an end to the visa lottery system and family-based migration that he calls chain migration. On Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security released a scathing critique of the latest bipartisan plan, which Mr. Trump vowed to veto.\n\nHere is how different proposals address the Dreamers\u2019 protections and five other critical issues:\n\nProtections for Dreamers\n\nMORE GENEROUS MORE RESTRICTIVE Path to citizenship for Dreamers and renewable legal status for parents 3-year renewable legal status for DACA recipients (a subset of Dreamers) Path to citizenship for Dreamers MORE GENEROUS MORE RESTRICTIVE Path to citizenship for Dreamers Path to citizenship for Dreamers and renewable legal status for parents 3-year renewable legal status for DACA recipients (a subset of Dreamers)\n\nAbout 700,000 undocumented immigrants are currently shielded from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. An additional 1.1 million Dreamers were eligible for the program, but they did not apply. Mr. Trump announced plans to phase out the program by March 5.\n\nMost of the major proposals in Congress include a path to citizenship for Dreamers. One, a more moderate bipartisan Senate proposal introduced by Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, along with four other senators in the so-called Gang of Six, would also allow parents of Dreamers to obtain three-year renewable legal status.\n\n(That proposal was rejected during a White House meeting in which Mr. Trump reportedly derided people from African nations.)\n\nPath to citizenship and parent benefit Path to citizenship No citizenship Proposal by: House Republicans White House Senator Flake Gang of Six McCain-Coons Common Sense Coalition The Senate voted down the proposals in yellow. Path to citizenship and parent benefit Path to citizenship No citizenship Proposal by: House Republicans White House Senator Flake Gang of Six McCain-Coons Common Sense Coalition The Senate voted down the proposals in yellow.\n\nA more conservative approach, written by the House Judiciary Committee chairman, Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, and supported by other Republicans in the House, does not provide a path to citizenship for Dreamers. Instead, it offers three-year renewable legal status for a smaller subset of immigrants who were DACA recipients.\n\nThe proposals also differ on who would qualify, potentially expanding protections for more than the 1.8 million immigrants who were eligible for DACA. A narrow bipartisan Senate plan, introduced by John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, includes more expansive thresholds for qualification, potentially expanding the number of eligible immigrants to 3.2 million. This plan was voted down Thursday.\n\nIn 2001, the Dream Act was introduced to provide a pathway to citizenship for these immigrants without additional immigration measures. Democrats still favor that approach, but it does not have enough support in the Republican-controlled Congress.\n\nBorder Wall\n\nNO MONEY MORE MONEY Limited funding for a border wall No funding for a border wall More funding for a border wall NO MONEY MORE MONEY Limited funding for a border wall No funding for a border wall More funding for a border wall\n\nMr. Trump has called for full funding, an estimated $25 billion over 10 years, to fulfill his campaign promise to build a wall along the southern border with Mexico, which Democrats have generally opposed. The White House plan has been introduced as legislation by Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa. It would appropriate $25 billion for a border security trust fund, of which $18 billion would go toward a wall and other physical barriers. It was also voted down Thursday.\n\nThe House Republican plan \u201cauthorizes\u201d about $25 billion for border security, designating $9.3 billion of that for physical barriers like a wall. An authorization is a step taken before an \u201cappropriation,\u201d which is actual funding.\n\nSmall amount of money More money No money Proposal by: House Republicans White House Senator Flake Gang of Six McCain-Coons Common Sense Coalition The Senate voted down the proposals in yellow. Small amount of money More money No money Proposal by: House Republicans White House Senator Flake Gang of Six McCain-Coons Common Sense Coalition The Senate voted down the proposals in yellow.\n\nThe Common Sense Coalition, a bipartisan group of senators led by Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, released a proposal late Wednesday that would appropriate $25 billion for border security overall. On Thursday, the White House released a statement saying that if that plan came to the president\u2019s desk, \u201chis advisors would recommend that he veto it.\u201d Later, the Senate voted against a motion to advance the plan.\n\nA compromise plan developed by Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, addresses the White House\u2019s four priorities, including $25 billion for a border security trust fund.\n\nThe Gang of Six plan would appropriate a total of just $1.6 billion for a border wall. A similar plan has been introduced in the House by the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus.\n\nOther Border Security\n\nLESS AGGRESSIVE MORE AGGRESSIVE Significant funding for border security Limited funding for border security Significant funding for border security and new bio-metric exit-entry system LESS AGGRESSIVE MORE AGGRESSIVE Limited funding for border security Significant funding for border security Significant funding for border security and new bio-metric exit-entry system\n\nRepublicans want to beef up security along the border as a condition for other reforms. The House Republican plan takes the most aggressive approach, including a new biometric entry-exit system \u201cat all air, land, and sea ports of entry,\u201d with a $15.7 billion authorization for border security on top of money for a wall.\n\nLimited funding More funding Most aggressive Proposal by: House Republicans White House Senator Flake Gang of Six McCain-Coons Common Sense Coalition The Senate voted down the proposals in yellow. Limited funding More funding Most aggressive Proposal by: House Republicans White House Senator Flake Gang of Six McCain-Coons Common Sense Coalition The Senate voted down the proposals in yellow.\n\nThe narrow McCain-Coons plan authorizes (but would not appropriate) a small amount of money ($550 million over 10 years) for border security. That plan is nearly identical to a House bill that has more than 50 bipartisan co-sponsors, but it is not likely to have enough Republican support to pass.\n\nEven the most expensive plans fall short of the border security funding included in the 2013 immigration bill that was passed in the Senate but was never taken up in the House. That compromise bill devoted roughly $40 billion to border security. In exchange, the bill also included a path to citizenship for all 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, with an expedited path for Dreamers.\n\nInterior Enforcement\n\nSTATUS QUO MORE ENFORCEMENT Heavier enforcement of immigration laws No increased enforcement of immigration laws Heavier enforcement of immigration laws, crack down on sanctuary cities, implement E-Verify STATUS QUO MORE ENFORCEMENT Heavier enforcement of immigration laws No increased enforcement of immigration laws Heavier enforcement of immigration laws, crack down on sanctuary cities, implement E-Verify\n\nMr. Trump, along with hard-line Republicans, wants to crack down on unauthorized immigrants with more arrests and faster deportations. The White House plan introduces harsher criminal penalties for deported criminals who re-enter the country and expands the criminal activities that would result in removal for unauthorized immigrants.\n\nThe House Republican plan includes many of the same provisions but goes further. It would implement mandatory E-Verify systems for employers, authorize the Justice Department to crack down on so-called sanctuary cities and make visa overstays a federal misdemeanor.\n\nA separate vote to advance an amendment that would withhold federal grants from sanctuary cities failed in the Senate on Thursday. Four Democrats joined the Republicans in supporting it, but they did not reach the 60 votes needed to proceed.\n\nStatus quo Heavier enforcement Most aggressive enforcement Proposal by: House Republicans White House Senator Flake Gang of Six McCain-Coons Common Sense Coalition The Senate voted down the proposals in yellow. Most aggressive enforcement Status quo Heavier enforcement Proposal by: House Republicans White House Senator Flake Gang of Six McCain-Coons Common Sense Coalition The Senate voted down the proposals in yellow.\n\nNone of the other major plans include increased interior enforcement measures.\n\nFamily-Based Migration\n\nSTATUS QUO FEWER VISAS Scale back family-based migration and reallocate visas No change to current visa system Scale back family-based migration and not reallocate visas STATUS QUO FEWER VISAS Scale back family-based migration and reallocate visas No change to current visa system Scale back family-based migration and not reallocate visas\n\nAnother one of the administration\u2019s four priorities is ending \u201cchain migration\u201d \u2014 migration that allows legal immigrants to sponsor extended family members.\n\nThe hard-line plans by the White House and by House Republicans would limit family-based migration to spouses and children and would not reallocate those visas (or would only reallocate a limited number), resulting in less legal immigration over all.\n\nStatus quo Redistribute visas Fewer visas Proposal by: House Republicans White House Senator Flake Gang of Six McCain-Coons Common Sense Coalition The Senate voted down the proposals in yellow. Status quo Redistribute visas Fewer visas Proposal by: House Republicans White House Senator Flake Gang of Six McCain-Coons Common Sense Coalition The Senate voted down the proposals in yellow.\n\nOther plans, from the bipartisan Gang of Six and Senator Flake, also limit family-based migration to spouses and children but redistribute the remaining visas to highly educated and skilled workers or qualifying family.\n\nThe Common Sense Coalition plan prohibits green card holders from sponsoring adult children. The McCain-Coons plan does not make changes to the visa system.\n\nDiversity Visa Lottery\n\nSTATUS QUO FEWER VISAS End diversity lottery and reallocate visas No change to current diversity lottery visa system End diversity lottery and not reallocate visas STATUS QUO FEWER VISAS End diversity lottery and reallocate visas No change to current diversity lottery visa system End diversity lottery and not reallocate visas\n\nLike the family-based migration changes, ending the diversity visa program is a priority of the Trump administration. The White House plan and the House Republican plan would eliminate the program without redistributing its visas. The Migration Policy Institute, a research organization, estimates that both plans would result in a drop of 30 percent in legal immigration because of their family-based visa and diversity lottery provisions.\n\nStatus quo Redistribute visas Fewer visas Proposal by: House Republicans White House Senator Flake Gang of Six McCain-Coons Common Sense Coalition The Senate voted down the proposals in yellow. Status quo Redistribute visas Fewer visas Proposal by: House Republicans White House Senator Flake Gang of Six McCain-Coons Common Sense Coalition The Senate voted down the proposals in yellow.\n\nUnder Senator Flake\u2019s plan, diversity lottery visas would be partially reallocated, but the number available would eventually drop off. The Gang of Six plan would also end the program, but would redistribute all of the visas, with some going to vulnerable populations that are in the country under Temporary Protected Status.", "keywords": ["dreamers", "tied", "senator", "white", "gop", "plan", "senate", "gang", "house", "visas", "demands", "immigration", "funding", "fate", "border", "wall", "republicans"], "polarity": 0.050340349305866554, "subjectivity": 0.3455140426076389},

Bush administration. \u201cEverybody breathes the same air, Democrats or Republicans. It does not matter. This is about keeping people healthy.\u201d\n\nBut the Fitzgerald family has had influential allies. In addition to Mr. Pruitt, they include Representative Diane Black, a Republican who is a candidate for Tennessee governor, and Tennessee Technological University, a state university that produced a study minimizing pollution problems associated with the trucks.\n\nMs. Black introduced legislation in 2015 to protect the loophole when it was first in line to be eliminated by a stricter diesel emissions rule under the Obama administration. That bill failed, but after the election of Mr. Trump, she turned to Mr. Pruitt to carve out an exemption to the new rule \u2014 scheduled to take effect last month \u2014 and presented him with the study from Tennessee Tech.\n\nFitzgerald had not only paid for the study, which has roiled the faculty at Tennessee Tech and is the subject of an internal investigation, but it had also offered to build a new research center for the university on land owned by the company. And in the six weeks before Mr. Pruitt announced in November that he would grant the exemption, Fitzgerald business entities, executives and family members contributed at least $225,000 to Ms. Black\u2019s campaign for governor, campaign disclosure records show.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe multiple donors allowed the company to circumvent a Tennessee state law intended to limit the size of campaign contributions by corporations and political action committees. The donations \u2014 many of which came through a series of limited liability companies tied to the family \u2014 represented 12 percent of the money Ms. Black had raised from outside sources through last month, the records show.\n\nTommy Fitzgerald, an owner of Fitzgerald, said the actions by Ms. Black and Mr. Pruitt were good public policy and not special favors to his company.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why anyone would want to kill all these jobs,\u201d Mr. Fitzgerald said, referring to the several hundred people he said he employs at his dealerships, many of them in rural areas. \u201cIt does not make any sense.\u201d\n\nChris Hartline, a spokesman for Ms. Black, said the congresswoman had stood up for a constituent and was not influenced by the campaign donations, which he said complied with state law. \u201cThere are very few companies willing to try and keep manufacturing jobs in rural Tennessee today, and Diane fights hard to support the few that do,\u201d Mr. Hartline said.\n\nAn E.P.A. spokeswoman, Liz Bowman, said that Mr. Pruitt remained committed to protecting clean air. But, she said, he agreed with a legal argument made by Ms. Black and Fitzgerald that the agency did not have the authority to limit sales.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cE.P.A. is acting on behalf of anyone who sees merit in upholding and perhaps even bolstering the credibility of our laws and the role of Congress,\u201d Ms. Bowman said.\n\nShe said that the money donated to Ms. Black had no impact on the decision by Mr. Pruitt.\n\nNew Trucks, Old Engines\n\nThe trucks sold by Fitzgerald are known as \u201cgliders\u201d because they are manufactured without engines and are later retrofitted with the rebuilt ones. Gliders are popular among small trucking companies and individual truck owners, who say they cannot afford to buy or operate vehicles with new engines and modern emissions controls.\n\nThe trucks, which Fitzgerald claims burn less fuel per mile and are cheaper to repair, have been on the market since at least the 1970s. But after the federal government moved to force improvements in truck emissions, with standards that were first enacted during the Clinton administration and took full effect by 2010, gliders became a way for trucking companies to legally skirt the rules.\n\nDealers like Fitzgerald buy truck bodies from Peterbilt, Freightliner and other manufacturers and typically install 1990s-era engines, recovered from salvage yards, that its employees rebuild down to their cores. The used engines and other remanufactured parts allow dealers to claim that the new trucks predate emissions requirements, and therefore should be exempt.\n\nNationally, an estimated 10,000 glider trucks were sold in 2015 \u2014 or about 4 percent of all new heavy-duty truck sales \u2014 the last full year for which data is available, up from fewer than 1,000 in 2010. Fitzgerald is the industry\u2019s largest dealer in retrofitting the trucks by selling so-called glider kit trucks, for about $130,000. Modern trucks, which also include collision avoidance equipment, cost between $145,000 and $170,000, dealers said.\n\n\u201cI hate government mandates,\u201d said Paul Bailey, a state senator and the operations manager at CB Trucking in Cookeville, Tenn., which hauls everything from building supplies to mustard in its fleet of 60 glider trucks, two-thirds of which were purchased from Fitzgerald.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe glider trucks take advantage of other regulatory loopholes. Since most of the engines were manufactured before 1999, the trucks are exempt from a federal law that went into effect in December intended to prevent accidents caused by fatigued drivers. The law requires commercial truck drivers to use an electronic logging system to track how many hours they spend behind the wheel, and to take mandatory breaks. The law covers truck engines manufactured after 1999.\n\nThe glider trucks, in some cases, also are not subject to a 12 percent federal excise tax imposed on truck sales, because they are not considered new trucks. Ms. Black intervened with the Internal Revenue Service last year, along with three other members of Congress, to protect that tax break.\n\nA Fitzgerald salesman boasted last week that all 150 trucks on the company\u2019s Crossville lot had been sold as trucking companies rushed to avoid the Obama-era emissions standards and the electronic tracking rule.\n\n\u201cWe cannot build them quick enough,\u201d said the salesman, Cody Poston. A second Fitzgerald salesman said the company had pending customer orders for 300 more and had about 2,000 glider trucks on the way to his sales lot.\n\nPhoto\n\nMatt Moorehead, who helps maintain trucks at the CB Trucking garage in Cookeville, said glider trucks allow small companies and individual drivers to compete with big trucking companies.\n\nHe said the trucks are easier to repair and, by some accounts, burn less diesel fuel per mile. And by avoiding the electronic tracking system, drivers can continue to use paper logs, which can be more easily manipulated to allow flexibility in driving and rest times.\n\n\u201cWhen you got a load of eggs and milk to deliver, these rules can force you to stop driving when you are just a few miles short of your destination,\u201d he said of the electronic tracking.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter E.P.A. officials, during the Obama administration, saw a surge in the number of glider trucks being sold, the agency moved to prohibit any company from manufacturing more than 300 of them per year, effectively killing the industry that had emerged to help sidestep the rules.\n\nFitzgerald, with Ms. Black\u2019s help, submitted a petition in July asking Mr. Pruitt to suspend the cap and declare that all gliders made by Fitzgerald and at least two other dealers \u2014 Iowa-based Harrison Truck Centers and Indiana Phoenix of Avilla, Ind. \u2014 be exempted because the new emissions requirements applied only to \u201cnew motor vehicle engines.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nTo bolster their argument, Fitzgerald submitted the study conducted by Tennessee Tech in late 2016. The study, which Mr. Pruitt cited in the E.P.A.\u2019s November announcement of the rollback, concluded that emissions from the company\u2019s trucks were as clean as those with modern systems.\n\nThe push by Fitzgerald had started by May, according to a calendar of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s visitors, when Mr. Pruitt and his chief of staff met with executives from Fitzgerald and Donald Shandy, an Oklahoma lawyer who knows Mr. Pruitt from his tenure as Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general.\n\nBy September, to keep the momentum going, Fitzgerald had hired its first full-time federal lobbyist \u2014 a former aide to Ms. Black.\n\n\u2018Super-Polluting Trucks\u2019\n\nTerry Dotson, president of Worldwide Equipment Enterprises, a Kentucky-based chain of truck dealerships that sells vehicles with modern emissions controls, said he remembered going into repair garages years ago when it was hard to breathe because of soot.\n\nMr. Dotson says he voted for President Trump and is a strong backer of the coal industry, which relies on his trucks for mining operations. But he does not agree with the administration\u2019s carve-out for glider trucks.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI want Mr. Fitzgerald to make a fortune and be a happy man,\u201d Mr. Dotson said outside one of his Knoxville, Tenn., dealerships. \u201cBut everybody ought to play by the same set of rules.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTruck manufacturers, as well as shipping companies like UPS, fear that a permanent loophole would encourage other truck dealers to enter the glider business, further undermining efforts to reduce health hazards associated with diesel exhaust and creating unfair competition for them. The National Association of Clean Air Agencies, representing state regulators, and the attorneys general from 12 states have joined in protesting the rollback.\n\nChet France, former director of assessment and standards at the E.P.A. Office of Transportation and Air Quality, says there are enough truck engines in salvage yards to support the glider market for decades.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about super-polluting trucks that are going to put the health of thousands of people at risk,\u201d said Mr. France, who worked at the E.P.A. for 30 years under Democratic and Republican administrations and is a consultant to the Environmental Defense Fund. \u201cAnd for what?\u201d\n\nThe E.P.A. estimates that over the life of every 10,000 trucks without modern emissions systems, up to 1,600 Americans would die prematurely, and thousands more would suffer a variety of ailments including bronchitis and heart attacks, particularly in cities with air pollution associated with diesel-powered trains, ships and power plants.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe health threats are caused by nitrogen oxide and tiny particles of dust and soot that create haze in the air.\n\nIn November, just days after Mr. Pruitt said he would eliminate the glider cap, staff members at the E.P.A. submitted an analysis to the agency\u2019s rule-making docket that contradicted the conclusions from Fitzgerald and Tennessee Tech that glider trucks created no more pollution than trucks with updated emissions systems.\n\nThe analysis said E.P.A. tests found that the Fitzgerald trucks emitted nitrogen oxide levels during highway operations that were 43 times as high as those from trucks with modern emissions control systems. The air pollution from these glider trucks was so bad that one year\u2019s worth of truck sales was estimated to release 13 times as much nitrogen oxide as all of the Volkswagen diesel cars with fraudulent emissions controls, a scheme that resulted in a criminal case against the company and more than $4 billion in fines.\n\nWhen testing the glider trucks in stop-and-go traffic, the E.P.A. report said, the testing equipment shut down because of the extreme level of particulates.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe filters were overloaded with particulate matter,\u201d said the report, which included a photograph of the white filter that had turned pitch black.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn recent weeks, other questions have been raised about the accuracy of the Tennessee Tech study, the role engineering experts at the university played in it, and the relationship between Fitzgerald and the university.\n\nThe signature of Tennessee Tech\u2019s president, Philip B. Oldham, appeared on the study, which was included in the petition Fitzgerald submitted in July to eliminate the cap. In April, Mr. Oldham was photographed with Mr. Fitzgerald at the Bristol Motor Speedway in Tennessee, where Fitzgerald sponsors the Fitzgerald Glider Kits 300, a Nascar Xfinity Series stock car race. Mr. Oldham presided over an event at the university in August, where Fitzgerald announced it would build a new academic research center for the university.\n\nSome faculty members say the university appears to have been used by Fitzgerald as part of its lobbying campaign.\n\n\u201cOur reputation has recently been damaged because of a study funded by Fitzgerald Glider Kits and used to influence federal policy,\u201d said a faculty senate resolution passed late last month. Christy Killman, president of the faculty senate, said the results of the study \u201craised a red flag.\u201d\n\nMr. Oldham did not respond to a request for comment, but he sent a letter to Ms. Killman this month confirming that a \u201cmisconduct in research\u201d investigation had been started, at the faculty\u2019s request, adding that he wanted to ensure the university\u2019s reputation as an \u201chonest broker of knowledge.\u201d\n\nThe public comment period on Mr. Pruitt\u2019s intention to repeal the annual cap on glider trucks has passed. Ms. Bowman, the E.P.A. spokeswoman, says the agency is now reviewing the comments before Mr. Pruitt announces a final decision.\n\n\u201cContinuing to improve air quality is a stated priority of Administrator Pruitt\u2019s,\u201d Ms. Bowman said. \u201cAny comments received that raise concerns with the ability to maintain that goal are closely considered and analyzed.\u201d\n\nAt Fitzgerald\u2019s sales lot, employees said last week that there was no need to worry about pollution from the trucks, adding that they had emissions test results to prove it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey are just as clean,\u201d Mr. Poston said of the gliders, compared with modern trucks, \u201cif not cleaner.\u201d", "keywords": ["trumps", "fitzgerald", "glider", "secure", "help", "epa", "ms", "pollution", "mr", "tennessee", "trucks", "emissions", "loophole", "pruitt", "truck", "225000"], "polarity": 0.048188334962528515, "subjectivity": 0.37268291207000875},

So, in 1932, when Mother was 19 and Daddy had just turned 20, they eloped.\u201d\n\nShe recalled how, after her father had a heart attack and lost his job, her mother \u201cput on her best dress and walked to the Sears and got a minimum-wage job\u201d \u2014 a job that saved them from foreclosure until her dad found work as a janitor.\n\nMs. Warren, who also met privately with some tribal leaders while they were in town, offered the group \u201ca promise.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEach time, she said, \u201csomeone brings up my family\u2019s story, I\u2019m going to use it to lift up the story of your families and your communities.\u201d\n\nShe vowed to draw attention to health care and environmental inequities on reservations as well as startling statistics, noting that \u201cmore than half \u2014 half \u2014 of native women have experienced sexual violence.\u201d\n\nMs. Warren was plainly hoping to respond to an article last month in The Boston Globe that raised questions about her commitment to tribal issues.\n\nYet her remarks made clear that she also sees political opportunity in her long-running feud with Mr. Trump, a way to demonstrate to Democrats that she will aggressively confront him.\n\n\u201cShe is taking a perceived liability and not just taking it on, but trying it out as a weapon against the president,\u201d said Mo Elleithee, a longtime Democratic strategist.\n\nMs. Warren won applause by pointedly invoking one of Mr. Trump\u2019s favorite presidents.\n\n\u201cIt is deeply offensive that this president keeps a portrait of Andrew Jackson hanging in the Oval Office, honoring a man who did his best to wipe out native people,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd when she brought up Pocahontas, she did not just scorn Mr. Trump.

But \u201cBlack Panther\u201d also arrives at a time when studios have started to respond to growing pressure to make their big-budget movies more inclusive, driven in part by the recent #OscarsSoWhite movement. And with audiences increasingly inclined to stay home and watch Netflix, producing movies featuring lead characters with different skin colors, genders and sexualities is proving to be good business.\n\nPhoto\n\nAttendance at theaters in North America, the world\u2019s largest movie market, dropped 6 percent in 2017, hitting a 22-year low. At the same time, studios are more reliant than ever on ticket sales. Their home-entertainment businesses \u2014 negatively impacted by the rise of streaming services \u2014 are collapsing to an alarming degree. The major studios reported an 18 percent drop in holiday home-video rental and sales revenue, including video-on-demand purchases, compared to a year earlier.\n\n\u201cHollywood can no longer afford to take any moviegoer for granted,\u201d Mr. Bock said. \u201cThat is causing them to look at underserved groups where there is pent-up demand, and the black audience is one.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDisney, which spent roughly $350 million to make and market \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d remains cautious about declaring global victory, noting that the film will not arrive in crucial markets like China and Japan until next month. The movie, focused on one of Marvel\u2019s lesser-known superheroes and set in the fictional country of Wakanda, will be playing in 70 percent of the world by Friday, with its rollout having started on Tuesday in the United Kingdom.\n\nBut even if \u201cBlack Panther\u201d stumbles in some countries, it will easily become the top-grossing film by a black director and with a largely black cast in Hollywood history, surpassing \u201cStraight Outta Compton,\u201d which took in $214 million worldwide in 2015, after adjusting for inflation. \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d directed by Ryan Coogler, will also break box office records in North America, where ticket sales between Friday and Monday are expected to total about $165 million, an astounding start for a film released outside the holiday and summer corridors.\n\nThe record-holder for a February release is \u201cDeadpool,\u201d which arrived to an adjusted $159 million in 2016 and itself challenged conventional wisdom, proving that an R-rated superhero movie could strike a broad chord. \u201cDeadpool\u201d went on to collect an adjusted $819 million for 20th Century Fox, which will release a sequel in May.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnother test will come on March 16, when 20th Century Fox releases \u201cLove, Simon,\u201d a $17 million romantic comedy centered on a gay teenager. Studios have long insisted that multiplex crowds will not support same-sex love stories, dismissing \u201cBrokeback Mountain,\u201d which took in $231 million in 2005 for Focus Features, after adjusting for inflation, as an Oscar-boosted exception to the rule. Fox is the first major studio to take a chance on a movie anchored by a gay character in memory.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m done living in a world where I don\u2019t get to be who I am,\u201d Nick Robinson, playing the lead role, says in the \u201cLove, Simon\u201d trailer. \u201cI deserve a great love story.\u201d\n\nStudio chiefs keep their jobs by delivering hits, and they try to do that by avoiding constructs that have fizzled in the past. For years, female superheroes were held back by the argument \u2014 a ridiculous one in the eyes of many critics \u2014 that male ticket buyers would stay home if a woman led the action. The failures of the critically derided films \u201cCatwoman\u201d in 2004 and \u201cElektra\u201d in 2005 were used as proof. As studios have become more reliant on overseas ticket sales, they have shunned movies that focus on black characters by citing lackluster foreign interest in films like \u201cDreamgirls\u201d in 2007 and Tyler Perry\u2019s \u201cMadea\u201d series.\n\nSome film executives even cite \u201cGet Out\u201d as a cautionary example. That Oscar-nominated horror movie, about racism in the liberal white suburbs, collected a robust $176 million in North America but a comparatively slight $79 million overseas.\n\nAs studios embrace a wider variety of stories with more diverse casts, they have had to confront pockets of racism, sexism and homophobia. Internet trolls tried to use Facebook to organize a campaign to falsely drag down scores for \u201cBlack Panther\u201d on the influential review site Rotten Tomatoes. Some men had a conniption when a Texas theater organized all-women screenings for \u201cWonder Woman.\u201d An Alabama theater banned Disney\u2019s live-action \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d over a gay sidekick character, creating a media frenzy.\n\nPhoto\n\nDisney\u2019s willingness to withstand that kind of resistance reflects the emphasis that Robert A. Iger, the company\u2019s chief executive, has put on diverse casting and storytelling across the Magic Kingdom. As he said at Disney\u2019s most recent shareholder meeting, referring to inclusion and equality: \u201cWe can take those values, which we deem important societally, and actually change peoples\u2019 behavior \u2014 get people to be more accepting of the multiple differences and cultures and races and all other facets of our lives and our people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKevin Feige, president of Marvel Studios, and Alan H. Horn, Disney\u2019s movie chairman, were eager to make \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d But it was ultimately Mr. Iger who pushed the movie ahead, overruling those who worried that it would not generate adequate sales of related toys.\n\n\u201cIt became a company initiative as led by Bob,\u201d Mr. Feige said. \u201cHe holds a lot of sway, as you might imagine.\u201d (\u201cBlack Panther,\u201d for the record, ended up with the largest merchandise line ever for a Marvel nonsequel.)\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Bryant Hargroue, who participated in the parade in Jackson, said the banner should not be associated with slavery and was supported by 65 percent of the population in a 2001 vote.\n\nHe filmed the encounter on Saturday and took issue with Officer Jackson\u2019s behavior. \u201cThis is not a color thing to me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the way he was out there acting in front of women and children.\u201d\n\nOfficer Jackson said he was trying to do his job and did not intend to make a political statement about the state flag.

Townships have gotten electricity and more modern housing. Government contracts have been set aside for black would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nThese programs have had an impact, improving material conditions and generating jobs.\n\nThey have also been riddled with corruption.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt local governments across South Africa, bureaucrats have abused their authority to steer contracts to companies that put cash in their pockets. At every level of society, people have grown accustomed to kickbacks and political connections determining who prospers, and who goes without.\n\nMr. Zuma\u2019s demise resonates as a sign of a potential new order taking shape. He will forever be linked to his association with the Guptas, three Indian-born brothers who effectively bought key levers of governmental power, amassing influence so comprehensive that it became known as \u201cstate capture.\u201d\n\nHis resignation has raised hopes that South Africa is finally contending with its epidemic of corruption. That view gained momentum when an elite police unit raided a home belonging to the Guptas nearly at the same moment that Mr. Ramaphosa was assuming office.\n\nThe new president is a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle, a former deputy president and chairman of the National Planning Commission, a focal point for thinking about how to engineer economic growth. As a former trade union leader and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Mandela, he enjoys credibility among a range of interest groups, while carrying a reputation as a savvy and strategic operator.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe has had his brushes with controversy, most notably after a 2012 police massacre of striking platinum miners that killed 34 people. At the time, Mr. Ramaphosa occupied a seat on the board of Lonmin, the company that owned the mine. Emails soon surfaced showing that, a day before the police opened fire, Mr. Ramaphosa had been urging senior government officials to take strong action to end the strike.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, no corruption charges have stuck to the new president, who now claims a mandate to clean up the toxic mess left behind by Mr. Zuma.\n\nSome doubt whether the A.N.C. can be salvaged as an effective vehicle for egalitarian policymaking. The party\u2019s executive ranks include many figures implicated in corruption. Mr. Ramaphosa, 65, may champion new initiatives aimed at generating economic growth, yet he finds himself relying on his party brethren to execute his visions, with no certainty that the money will land where intended.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think that taking the president out does much to dismantle the patronage network,\u201d said Ayabonga Cawe, a development economist at Xesibe Holdings, a research and advisory firm in Johannesburg. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need a lot more than taking out the guy at the top.\u201d\n\nAbove all, Mr. Ramaphosa must contend with the structural defects that have long constrained South Africa\u2019s economy, a legacy of apartheid.\n\nBeyond its systemic discrimination against black people, apartheid severed the country from much of the global economy. It ensured that huge numbers of uneducated black South Africans were available at poverty-level wages within major sectors of the economy like mining, agriculture and textiles. That cushioned domestic companies from the pressure to modernize.\n\nPhoto\n\nInternational sanctions isolated South Africa, shielding its firms from competition against multinational rivals. Sanctions also denied South African companies the ability to operate abroad, giving them an incentive to focus on the domestic market. The apartheid-era government obliged with subsidies for favored firms while allowing companies to pursue oligopoly, free of nuisances like antitrust law.\n\nThe result was a system in which large industries, from retail to furniture-making to chemicals, were dominated by huge enterprises whose core strength was the ability to protect themselves against competition. That system has largely prevailed, with smaller companies and start-ups facing often-impossible odds.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cApartheid was a system that lends itself to large conglomerates and concentrations of wealth in the hands of a few,\u201d Mr. Cawe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the corruption. It\u2019s about all of these parallel networks in big business that you need to dismantle. Most of those are white.\u201d\n\nHere is a world that Mr. Ramaphosa knows keenly, having achieved extraordinary affluence by running South African companies with interests in mining, banking, real estate and telecommunications. His fortune has been estimated at $450 million.\n\nIf he is serious about reinvigorating the economy and creating a space for black-owned small businesses, he will need to take on the prevailing structure that made him so wealthy.\n\nHis success on that front may be even more decisive than whether he can tame corruption.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly the most optimistic moment for South Africa in a very long time,\u201d said Mr. Goldin, the former adviser to Mr. Mandela. \u201cIn a way, it does feel like a new beginning.

The aggressive pace of deportations of immigrants of color, the elimination of the DACA program protecting immigrant children and the proposals propounded by the anti-immigration voices in the administration will all have the undeniable effect of slowing the rapid racial diversification of the United States population. Despite this sweeping attempt at racial social engineering, few voices in progressive and Democratic circles are responding with the kinds of outrage that one would expect.\n\nThe pro-white preferences of Donald Trump and his administration, especially when it comes to immigration, are legion. From the day he opened his presidential campaign in 2015 by demonizing Mexicans to the enthusiasm generated by the calls for building a wall along the Mexican border to aggressively ramping up deportations of immigrants of color to eliminating DACA to vulgarly denigrating African nations and Haiti, this administration has been quite clear about its preference for white people.\n\nIt should be no surprise, then, that the immigration policies championed by the White House would all have the effect of reducing the number of people of color coming into the country. A recent study by The Washington Post found that the administration\u2019s proposals to curtail legal immigration by limiting family reunification would slightly delay the date when whites become a minority. \u201cBy greatly slashing the number of Hispanic and black African immigrants entering America, this proposal would reshape the future United States,\u201d the economist Michael Clemens said.\n\n\u201cDecades ahead,\u201d he added, \u201cmany fewer of us would be nonwhite or have nonwhite people in our families.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe administration\u2019s focus is not random.

People of color used to make up 12 percent of the United States population in 1965, and that percentage has more than tripled over the past several decades to the point where nonwhite people are nearly 39 percent of the residents of the United States (it is no accident that the country\u2019s first African-American president was elected when he was elected). Mr. Trump\u2019s team understands that the specific laws it seeks to eliminate have played a significant role in that demographic revolution.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

The very first immigration law passed, the Naturalization Act of 1790, declared that to become a citizen, one had to be a \u201cfree white person.\u201d That demarcation was the explicit law of the land for the next 162 years, until 1952.

It deserved to be widely read, but the scale of its success is partly a function of its utility as a weapon against white arrogance. \u201cHowever bad Zuma is,\u201d its many black readers could say to themselves, \u201cyou people were worse.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

For the truth is that Mr. Zuma and his allies were corrupt partly because they felt a sense of grievance intimately connected to their experience of race.\n\nWhen Mr. Zuma became president of South Africa in 2009, he rallied behind him an alliance of people who felt themselves to be marginal and neglected, not just in relation to the world economic order or white South Africa but also in relation to the A.N.C. itself. The A.N.C. has been run by people drawn from the ranks of an urbane, cosmopolitan elite.\n\nMr. Zuma represented a dramatic change in this tradition. Although he spent years in exile and climbed the ranks of the A.N.C., his biography was unlike any of his predecessors\u2019. Nelson Mandela was born into royalty. Thabo Mbeki was the son of prominent intellectuals. Mr. Zuma\u2019s mother worked in the kitchen of a white family and was too poor to provide her son with a formal education. He grew up herding cattle in the hinterland.\n\nWhen he came to power in 2009, he did so with the support of organizations representing much of the urban working class \u2014 the country\u2019s largest trade union and the South African Communist Party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut he soon dropped these organizations and turned for support to rural South Africa, in particular to traditional leaders and to the elites of far-flung provincial capitals. They carried with them into power an abiding sense of powerlessness, a feeling that the very institutions they now controlled were alien and belonged to others. In office, they believed that they had entered into their enemy\u2019s mansion. It seemed to be payback time.\n\nIn a speech delivered to a room of black businesspeople in December 2016, Mr. Zuma warned of the sophisticated ways in which the enemy confuses black people. One source of such confusion was the prevailing economic orthodoxy. Mr. Zuma suggested that the most fundamental of economic laws was merely nominal; remove the scales from our eyes and we see that so-called economic laws are a ruse invented by the powerful.\n\nHis genre of criminality is light-years from the sort that characterized the apartheid state. The corruption of apartheid\u2019s leaders stemmed from arrogance; they believed that they could control the world forever. Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption stems from the grievances of a man who feels very small.\n\nThis sense of grievance was on display in the last words he uttered publicly as president. In a swipe at his successor, Mr. Ramaphosa, Mr. Zuma suggested that those in the party who had unseated him were \u201cserving the interests of the oppressors of yesteryear, who joyfully celebrate as we lynch one another.\u201d\n\nBlack nationalism in South Africa has many faces. Mr. Ramaphosa represents a strand that is bourgeois, worldly and comfortable with power. There is also a militant, socialist strand of black nationalism, but it is on the wane. And there is the strand represented by Mr. Zuma, who governed as a man shaped and distorted by the violence and oppression of white supremacy.\n\nI am of course alive to the irony of a white South African like me saying that a black president\u2019s corruption was motivated by racial grievance. Many South Africans, black and white, would regard this argument as an excuse for the intolerable. But we should be honest enough to accept that even now, notwithstanding that apartheid has been gone since before nearly half the South African population was born, the legacy of white supremacy has lived on in the man who was president.", "keywords": ["africa", "distinctive", "white", "south", "apartheid", "zumas", "zuma", "mr", "mess", "black", "whats", "corruption", "jacob", "economic"], "polarity": 0.0616115067727971, "subjectivity": 0.37158776707163793},

Evenly lit, crisply photographed, they look like pictures from an illustrated medical dictionary, indexical images of heads, torsos and mouths that are detached from context. Even in a work like \u201cFigure\u201d (1991), the figure in question, sheathed in a black dress and set in the black infinity of no particular place, feels like a fragment, as though she had been extracted from a group photo or a furnished room. The texts accompanying her, eight engraved plastic plaques, read like excerpts from a language primer: \u201cfigured the worst,\u201d \u201che was disfigured,\u201d \u201cfigured there would be no reaction\u201d and so on. Here, not only has the story been winnowed down; it is in fact completely gone. There\u2019s no story. We are left with only the tensions of concrete poetry.\n\nSometime in the mid-1990s, Simpson began to detect clich\u00e9d responses to her work. At the same time, her own thinking was evolving. What does an image of a black woman mean? A commentary on race? An assertion about gender? Simpson branched out from figure-based images and began to experiment more with varied subject matter \u2014 landscapes and inanimate objects like wigs \u2014 and also with unusual quasi-sculptural material like felt and standing screens. A series of monumental multisectional images, several of them landscapes, collectively titled \u201cPublic Sex\u201d (1995-1998) and featuring no figures at all, addressed the provocative title only obliquely. These pictures, made over many years, contain what the scholar and curator Okwui Enwezor calls \u201cthe rumor of the body.\u201d Mysteries of a jagged and deadpan sort, they would go on to influence the noirish tone of Simpson\u2019s later film work.\n\nPhoto\n\nSimpson began to set ever more intricate conceptual layers between her initial inspiration for a work and the finished product. The idea for \u201c9 Props\u201d (1995) began during a residency at the Pilchuck Glass School in Washington. With the aid of artisans at the school, she fabricated a series of dark vessels modeled on vases and other objects used in the portrait work of the pioneering Harlem photographer James Van Der Zee. But these vessels were not the final work. She shipped them back to New York and then photographed them against a plain background. And that still was not the work. Further intervention followed: She turned those photographic images into nine lithographs, which she printed on felt. Finally, she wrote captions below each lithographed vessel, describing the context in which it originally appeared. One of them, for instance, reads:\n\nDinner Party with boxer Harry Wills, 1926 James VanDerZee Harry Wills a k a \u201cThe Black Panther,\u201d boxer, businessman- sits with seven other men and women, mostly women with champagne glasses raised as a woman on his left makes a toast in his honor. There are three bottles of champagne, a crystal decanter, a bottle of port, an arrangement of flowers and fruit, and before each guest an untouched china place setting.\n\nPhoto\n\nFrom multiple directions, the work gestures at what cannot be seen: the original placement of the vessels that inspired Simpson\u2019s own, the people in the photographs by James Van Der Zee, the social life of Harlem evoked by his photographs and the complexity of manners and class implied by them. All that vanished world of culture and experience is reduced to an elegant grid, as simple as an antiquarian\u2019s catalog, a thought picture that demands calm engagement and imaginative intervention on the viewer\u2019s part. Without being representational, it is about race; but race is not off in some category by itself, hemmed in only by questions of skin color, separate from life.\n\n\u201cRepresent!\u201d in the black American sense means standing up for your people, expressing solidarity and letting a shared ethos underwrite your presence and work. It is an exhortation, a greeting and a farewell. The word also has more conventional associations. In the visual arts, it is contrasted with the abstract or the symbolic. To represent, in this more common sense, is to make work that visually corresponds to realities out there in the world: to illustrate uncomplicatedly. This second sense of \u201crepresent\u201d is enjoying a vogue in the art world. Realism is back. This is welcome: after so long an absence of black figures and black faces in art museums, they are now being seen more frequently. Many artists, black and otherwise, are depicting the black body. It is necessary and often successful. Just as often, it fails when it is little more than a clumsy shorthand for socially concerned art, unobjectionable and unimpressive.\n\nA strong appeal of Simpson\u2019s work is that she has always embraced the inherent complexity of blackness, her own blackness as well as the blackness that runs ineluctably through American history. She does not reject representational depictions, but neither does she feel the need to confine herself only to \u201crace\u201d work. When an artist uses a black model, she is presenting a human question by foregrounding a human presence. Is a white man a person while a black woman is and can only be a gendered and racialized subject? As the scholar Kellie Jones has pointed out, nonwhite bodies are often thought of as \u201cnot neutral enough for the dispassionate formulas thought to constitute conceptual practice.\u201d If a black woman\u2019s race and gender are the only things apparent to certain viewers, Simpson seems to say, the ethical responsibility to escape those shackles is the viewer\u2019s.\n\nFreedom is Lorna Simpson\u2019s starting point and her permanent theme. A humane current animates all of her work, a current that neither sidesteps nor confines itself to race. Her work is simultaneously about the \u201cneutral\u201d space of ideas and the particularized experience of the body. \u201cMontage\u201d is photographic and painterly, a riff on a pair of found photographs, sequenced to look like a giant strip of film. It deals with dreams and nightmares, ambiguities and vulnerabilities. At its heart is what Simpson calls \u201cthe push and pull of photography\u201d: the stuttering potential inherent in mechanical reproduction and the imperfect registrations that mirror subconscious life. It is a rapid response to the current political climate, situating a crucial part of it in the most intimate space of all, where the hectoring \u201cthey\u201d is temporarily held at bay in favor of the puzzled \u201cI.\u201d In your own sleeping bed, images persist and words are hard to come by. It is the art we need now: rich, allusive, tongue-tied and unanswerable.", "keywords": ["images", "world", "seen", "race", "began", "cant", "simpson", "woman", "black", "evoking", "simpsons", "work", "art"], "polarity": 0.06682087932087931, "subjectivity": 0.4861752986752985},

To some extent, there\u2019s always been an adversarial role between the White House and reporters. How do you feel about the tenor of things now? It used to be friendly-adversarial. There would be retaliation for stories they didn\u2019t like, but nothing compared with this. There\u2019s a war going on. For a president to come out with the term \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 he\u2019s putting targets on our heads. He has moved the goal posts when it comes to how politicians and people deal with the press.\n\nWhat\u2019s the value of the White House press briefing? Transparency. There is a veil on the White House; people want to look behind the curtain. It\u2019s their house. When you open up a press briefing to see the back and forth, you\u2019re getting more in the weeds of what\u2019s going on, beyond just the quote we may put in the story. This is a key piece that I don\u2019t think people really get: When you talk about the press, it\u2019s not about journalists; it\u2019s about the free-flowing information that the American public is supposed to get. When you bash the press, you\u2019re bashing the idea of getting truth out.\n\nWhat\u2019s the public opinion of the White House press corps? It depends on whom you talk to. We\u2019re so tribal now. There used to be a day when you didn\u2019t know the person\u2019s politics. The line has been obscured between facts and opinion. I think it started during the Clinton years, and it just kept getting progressively worse. People don\u2019t want to just hear the news; they want to hear what people have to say about it too.\n\nYour reactions during the televised briefings have generated memes. Has it made you more self-conscious? I\u2019m so sad about that. My boss has always said, \u201cYou need to know how to play poker.\u201d I don\u2019t. I\u2019m trying! The last time I was really caught off guard was when Sarah Huckabee Sanders said something about people\u2019s minds being in the gutter after President Trump\u2019s tweet about Kirsten Gillibrand. I really get into those briefings. I really try to listen. I don\u2019t play to the camera. I go in there, and I\u2019m really earnest. So when she said that, I was shocked! I was like, No, God, that was a little bit much.\n\nGiven how much you tangle with this particular administration, why do you think you get called on so much? Have you felt like a target? Yes, I have. But I have to shake that off, because I have to go in and do my job. I cover the White House. I cover all issues, particularly those that affect black and brown Americans. Now, what if they didn\u2019t call on me? A certain segment of America would not get the answers to some of their pressing questions. If I don\u2019t ask, who will?\n\nRyan is the White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks and a political analyst for CNN.

You had to ask whether this president believed slavery was wrong. I recently asked him, \u201cAre you a racist?\u201d It\u2019s a sad day when you have to ask a sitting president that. There has been a series of comments or lack of action, from calling Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas\u201d to how he dealt with Charlottesville to his comments on Norway versus Haiti, Africa, El Salvador, black and brown nations. It\u2019s not been one thing. It\u2019s been a pattern. So I asked. He did not answer, which I thought was a wasted moment. He could have put it to rest right then and there and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a racist.\u201d But it took him days to say that.\n\nYou said it seems as if it has changed, going forward, how the White House deals with the press corps and wields its power. What do you think this means for the next president you cover? He\u2019ll clamp down harder on us. Each president has pushed us further away from access. Who knows what will happen or what another president may want? They may not want to be followed. President Obama didn\u2019t like being followed, for example. This president hates us.

She does not believe that her fianc\u00e9\u2019s 7-year-old son, Sawyer, who is white, sees the film or its characters through the lens of race.

Even the clothes are an 18th-century version of current POTUS style: basic black suit and fat tie. As for Washington, he stands blank-faced, one arm extended, like a tenor taking a dignified bow.\n\n[Read remarks from the Obamas and the artists. ]\n\nUninflected dignity was the attitude of choice for well over a century, with a few breaks. In an 1836 portrait, Andrew Jackson, a demonstrative bully, sports a floor-length, red-silk-lined Dracula cloak and a kind of topiary bouffant. (A picture of Jackson, one of President Trump\u2019s populist heroes, hangs in the Oval Office.) Abraham Lincoln, seen in several likenesses, is exceptional for looking as if he may actually have weighty matters on his mind. Most of the portraits that precede and follow his are pure P.R.\n\nThis continues well into the 20th century. In a 1980 painting Jimmy Carter trades a black suit for a beige one. How revolutionary is that? And there\u2019s a Casual Fridays vogue: Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both go tieless for it. Under the circumstances, Elaine de Kooning\u2019s 1963 portrait of John F. Kennedy, a fanfare of green and blue strokes, hits like a boost of adrenaline. Rousing too, though not in a good way, is a big head shot image of Bill Clinton by the artist Chuck Close. Using his signature mosaic-like painting technique, Mr. Close turns the 42nd president into a pixelated clown.\n\nMr. Obama has much better luck with his similarly high-profile portraitist. Mr. Wiley, born in Los Angeles in 1977, gained a following in the early 2000s with his crisp, glossy, life-size paintings of young African-American men dressed in hip-hop styles, but depicted in the old-master manner of European royal portraits. More recently he has expanded his repertoire to include female subjects, as well as models from Brazil, India, Nigeria and Senegal, creating the collective image of a global black aristocracy.\n\nIn an imposingly scaled painting \u2014 just over seven feet tall \u2014 the artist presents Mr. Obama dressed in the regulation black suit and an open-necked white shirt, and seated on a vaguely thronelike chair not so different from the one seen in Stuart\u2019s Washington portrait. But art historical references stop there. So do tonal echoes of past portraits. Whereas Mr. Obama\u2019s predecessors are, to the man, shown expressionless and composed, Mr. Obama sits tensely forward, frowning, elbows on his knees, arms crossed, as if listening hard. No smiles, no Mr. Nice Guy. He\u2019s still troubleshooting, still in the game.\n\nVideo\n\nHis engaged and assertive demeanor contradicts \u2014 and cosmetically corrects \u2014 the impression he often made in office of being philosophically detached from what was going on around him. At some level, all portraits are propaganda, political or personal. And what makes this one distinctive is the personal part.

African blue lilies represent Kenya, his father\u2019s birthplace; jasmine stands for Hawaii, where Mr. Obama himself was born; chrysanthemums, the official flower of Chicago, reference the city where his political career began, and where he met his wife.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMrs. Obama\u2019s choice of Ms. Sherald as an artist was an enterprising one. Ms. Sherald, who was born in Columbus, Ga., in 1973 and lives in Baltimore, is just beginning to move into the national spotlight after putting her career on hold for some years to deal with a family health crisis, and one of her own. (She had a heart transplant at 39.) Production-wise, she and Mr. Wiley operate quite differently. He runs the equivalent of a multinational art factory, with assistants churning out work. Ms. Sherald, who until a few years ago made her living waiting tables, oversees a studio staff of one, herself.\n\nAt the same time, they have much in common. Both focused early on African-American portraiture precisely because it is so little represented in Western art history. And both tend to blend fact and fiction. Mr. Wiley, with photo-realistic precision, casts actual people in fantastically heroic roles. (He modifies his heroizing in the case of Mr. Obama, but it\u2019s still there.) Ms. Sherald also starts with realism, but softens and abstracts it. She gives all her figures gray-toned skin \u2014 a color with ambiguous racial associations \u2014 and reduces bodies to geometric forms silhouetted against single-color fields.\n\nShe shows Mrs. Obama sitting against a field of light blue, wearing a spreading gown. The dress design, by Michelle Smith, is eye-teasingly complicated: mostly white interrupted by black Op Art-ish blips and patches of striped color suggestive of African textiles. The shape of the dress, rising pyramidally upward, mountain-like, feels as if it were the real subject of the portrait. Mrs. Obama\u2019s face forms the composition\u2019s peak, but could be almost anyone\u2019s face, like a model\u2019s face in a fashion spread. To be honest, I was anticipating \u2014 hoping for \u2014 a bolder, more incisive image of the strong-voiced person I imagine this former first lady to be.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m wishing, let me mention something more. Mr. Obama\u2019s portrait will be installed, long-term, among those of his presidential peers, in a dedicated space on the second floor. Mrs. Obama\u2019s will hang in a corridor reserved for temporary displays of new acquisitions \u2014 on the first floor. It will stay there until November, after which there\u2019s no set-aside place for it to land.\n\nIf first men have an acknowledged showcase, first women \u2014 ladies or not \u2014 should too. Better, they should all be together, sharing space, offering a welcoming environment to, among others, a future first female president, and creating a lasting monument to #MeToo.", "keywords": ["paint", "portrait", "obamas", "washington", "fiction", "fact", "blend", "mr", "black", "ms", "wiley", "portraits", "sherald", "obama", "politics"], "polarity": 0.07208600786186993, "subjectivity": 0.35921572042261696},

While it is true that compared with Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton lost ground with that segment of the electorate, the clues to a new Democratic majority may be found in the coalition that elected Mr. Northam governor of Virginia, or perhaps more accurately, voted against Mr. Gillespie and his immigrant bashing.\n\nIn Virginia, polling data has made it clear that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 rhetoric backfired among minority voters as well as, crucially, among many whites. Mr. Northam won a majority of white college-educated voters, who made up a larger share of the electorate in 2017 than they did in 2016. Mr. Gillespie matched Mr. Trump with noncollege whites, but their turnout was down. And minority voters in 2017 matched their 2016 electorate share \u2014 for the first time ever there was no drop-off from the presidential to the gubernatorial election. The Democrats also expanded their margin of victory in Virginia from five percentage points in 2016 to nine points in 2017.\n\nBefore the vote in Virginia, pundits on both the right and left were speculating that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s anti-immigrant strategy was working. But in the end, election results and polling data in Virginia proved all that thinking was wrong. While each state has its own demographics and distinct politics, Virginia has voters who span demographic and economic spectrums. Majorities of voters of all races and ethnicities rejected anti-immigrant stereotypes as ugly and wrong.\n\nAccording to an election eve survey of voters by Latino Decisions, Latino voters said that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads made them less enthusiastic about him, by a 45-point margin. But it wasn\u2019t just Latino voters. By a 23-point margin (52 to 29), whites in Virginia also said the MS-13 ads turned them away from Mr. Gillespie, as did African-American and Asian-American voters by larger margins.\n\nData speaks louder than punditry, and our regression analysis of survey data paints a clear picture. Exposure to Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads actually helped drive white college-educated voters away from the Republicans. When we analyzed findings for white independents and Republicans, voters who were aware of the MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Mr. Gillespie\u2019s Democratic opponent. What should be alarming for Republicans is that this effect wasn\u2019t limited to the governor\u2019s race. The Gillespie campaign had coattail effects, but of the wrong stripe. Across all racial groups, those who were aware of Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Democratic candidates for Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates.\n\nThis means that not only is it morally just for Democrats to position themselves as the party that stands against hatred and bigotry and in favor of inclusiveness and opportunity, but it is also a strategically sound position for winning votes. Simultaneously, it sends a clear, welcoming message to Latino, African-American and Asian-American voters, while also winning over enough of the white voters who also oppose immigrant bashing.\n\nThis phenomenon is particularly true of voters who will decide crucial House and Senate races in 2018: people of color and white college-educated voters \u2014 also known as the Democratic base. Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans are clearly gearing up for a similar anti-immigrant effort in 2018. But now the mask has been pulled off. Voters get it. Democrats have an opportunity to speak out strongly against bigotry. And in doing so, they have a path to victory in 2018 and beyond.", "keywords": ["virginia", "vote", "voters", "white", "ads", "gillespies", "immigration", "mr", "democrats", "win", "ms13", "republicans"], "polarity": 0.10965551203646441, "subjectivity": 0.4705427288760622},

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nYet, despite the obvious truth of that statement, we may wonder: What are the moral and political arguments that underwrite the claim that black lives matter? While there is no way to articulate the full scope of those arguments in a single essay, it\u2019s worth considering the philosophical contributions of some of the forerunners of the movement that is our most urgent manifestation of black thought today.\n\nThe end of the Civil War and the subsequent ratification of the 13th Amendment in 1865 legally abolished slavery, but blacks quickly became subject to a displaced form of violence at the hands of white supremacists across the nation who typically used false accusations of sexual assault to justify lynching black men. Police turned a blind eye to these murders, and sometimes actively facilitated them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIda B. Wells, a leading black thinker and journalist in the late-19th and early 20th centuries, and a co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, built a public career documenting lynchings and calling America to account for them. Her arguments extended and amplified those made by Frederick Douglass before her. Douglass\u2019s central claim in his seminal \u201cThe Meaning of July Fourth for the Negro\u201d was that Americans should feel shame for slavery, given their country\u2019s foundational commitment to liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We were failing our own ideals.\n\nWells pointed to the rise of lynching after the fall of slavery as not merely a legal matter to be rectified with new laws. Having fled her hometown to escape threats of her own lynching, Wells used the press to make her moral arguments. She described a nation in the grip of a dark remorse for freeing black Americans from slavery, and condemned white Americans for cruelties that violated their own commitment to the democratic project.\n\nThe horrors that Wells described were a factor in the Great Migration of blacks to the North, which fed the flourishing of black thought and cultural life that gave rise to the Harlem Renaissance. An indication that the Harlem Renaissance was always meant to be a period of radical black philosophy and social change was the name originally coined for the movement: The New Negro. Alain Locke, the Harvard-educated black intellectual who became known as the father of the Harlem Renaissance, envisioned a philosophical position that reinvigorated blacks\u2019 relationship to their culture and that would in turn solidify their status as equal co-participants in our democracy.\n\nA strong theme among some of the luminaries of the time focused on the will of blacks to assert their humanity against racism and to insist on their status as persons owed respect. Among those stars, the poet Langston Hughes was one of the brightest. His \u201cI Too\u201d is a quiet yet insistent poem depicting a black man employed by a white one and his struggle with invisibility. The protagonist resolves to sit at the table with the white folks the next day and show people how beautiful he is and that he, too, is America. The writer Zora Neale Hurston had an equally persistent but at times more playful take on the matter. In her essay \u201cHow It Feels to Be Colored Me,\u201d she wrote, \u201cSometimes, I feel discriminated against, but it does not make me angry. It merely astonishes me. How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company! It\u2019s beyond me.\u201d\n\nThinkers like Hughes and Hurston were involved in the Harlem Renaissance project of presenting a vision of black cultural vitality and worth that would rework the image of black Americans that whites typically relied upon. That stream of thought runs directly into the heart of Black Lives Matter.\n\nAnother valuable and necessary development to come out of the Black Lives Matter movement is the de-emphasizing of black patriarchy and the equal acknowledgment of the suffering of black women and the black L.G.T.B.Q. community. Though sexuality was an avenue of inquiry during the Harlem Renaissance, it was perhaps the mid- to late-20th century poet and theorist Audre Lorde who did the most to make black women\u2019s sexuality a focal point of political and social philosophy.\n\nWhile today \u201cintersectionality\u201d is bandied about as the cutting edge of social research, it was Lorde who in her writing insisted on complicating our view of personal identity by claiming that each of us belongs to multiple identity communities, all of which contribute to our sense of self and our purposes.\n\nShe also showed the broad reach of white supremacy and its effects on black Americans as they located themselves in more nuanced ways in the tapestry of American culture. For her, the primary form taken by resistance to racism was the denial of blunt categories imposed on black Americans, which stifled the possibility of an individual\u2019s full flourishing. Lorde, then, called for a radical form of self-possession whose boundaries were not open to negotiation with a white society.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen people think of Black Lives Matter, they often think of anger feeding forceful protests. Anger is a reasonable response to racial injustice. To be certain, groups like the Black Panthers and thinkers like Malcolm X advised black Americans to get angry and take the doctrine of armed self-defense seriously. Though anger and love are not mutually exclusive emotions, James Baldwin and Martin Luther King Jr. affirmed a view of civic love to pre-empt the need for violence.\n\nKing espoused a form of Kantian regard that prioritized conceiving of every human, racist or not, as owed a kind of love that is grounded in the ideal of universal respect. Baldwin held a slightly different view. He felt black Americans ought to see whites as democratic kin or family, as people with whom blacks would have serious quarrels but also people whom it would be worth keeping close in order to strengthen and bring integrity to the bonds of shared democratic life. These two views of love eschewed violence yet insisted on militancy. While forgiveness and acceptance were hallmarks of King\u2019s and Baldwin\u2019s views, so was an unyielding commitment to self-respect and the demand for social change to institutionalize the idea that blacks were co-creators of the American kingdom.\n\nThinkers like Wells, Hughes, Hurston, Lorde and Baldwin not only anticipated the current Black Lives Matter movement but provided an intellectual blueprint to give depth and integrity to that slogan, so that its meaning transcends the demand to stop police brutality. It is a demand for whites to extend their historical imagination and recognize that the ills of racism are not the result of a few bad police officers or a few out-and-out racists in some far-off corner of America. The problem, rather, is a kind of complicity \u2014 one partaking in the false comfort that America has somehow escaped the trajectory of its racially murderous history.

Bell Pottinger may have set back race relations in South Africa by as much as 10 years.\u201d\n\nWithin days of the firm\u2019s removal from the trade association, clients were fleeing. By the end of September, all 250 employees were laid off and Bell Pottinger was finished.\n\nA Unique Client List\n\nLondon is now home to a cluster of P.R. firms catering to foreign governments, raising worries that the city has become \u201cthe global capital of reputation laundering,\u201d as The Evening Standard put it a few years ago. Bell Pottinger established the template of this lucrative niche.\n\nIt was largely the brainchild of Tim Bell, who had earned his reputation, along with a knighthood, helping Margaret Thatcher win three elections. He came to fame with the \u201cLabour isn\u2019t working\u201d ads that helped the Conservative Party gain control of Parliament in the 1979 general election. Colleagues actually coined the phrase, and he talked Mrs. Thatcher into adopting it.\n\n\u201cThere were many conversations in which she shouted at me and told me I was an idiot,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI just had to stand my ground and say, \u2018I know what I\u2019m doing.\u2019\u201d\n\nNow 77, Mr. Bell appears to have stepped directly out of an Evelyn Waugh novel with everything but a smoking jacket. Gray haired with an owlish pair of black glasses, he speaks with jaunty indifference and ingratiating candor, a combination that always made the tsk-tskers who disapproved of his client list sound unworldly and na\u00efve.\n\n\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Breaking News Emails Sign up to receive an email from The New York Times as soon as important news breaks around the world.

When the pair started working together in the mid-80s, Mr. Bell was sought after by political leaders and corporations who wanted some of the communications magic he had provided to Mrs. Thatcher.\n\nBell Pottinger quickly had hundreds of clients, a few of them infamous. Mr. Bell attributes his ability to work with virtually anyone to innate optimism.\n\n\u201cI see the good in people,\u201d he said.\n\nThis included Chile\u2019s former dictator Augusto Pinochet. Mr. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain in 1998 as part of an effort to deport him to Spain, where he had been indicted on a charge of torturing Spanish citizens.\n\nAfter two years of legal and political wrangling, Mr. Bell and his allies prevailed when Mr. Pinochet was authorized to freely return to Chile.\n\nBell Pottinger was hardly the only British outfit working for rogues and despots, as well as publicly traded companies, nor was it the largest or most profitable. But it had a buccaneering spirit that made it the firm of choice for a wide variety of missions.\n\n\n\nDuring the war in Iraq, Bell Pottinger had a contract with the Pentagon to produce propaganda for the United States military. This included scripts in Arabic for a soap opera that aired in the country, said Mr. Bell.\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen the company\u2019s client list did not generate news, its methods did. In 2011, it was caught boasting about its skills in the dark arts of search engine manipulation to people it thought were potential clients.\n\nIn fact, they were undercover members of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit organization that works with a variety of media. Posing as executives from the made-up Azimov Group, these \u201crepresentatives\u201d said the company had ties to the Uzbekistan regime, which has been criticized for repression and for using forced child labor during its cotton harvest.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Azimov executives said they worried about blowback.\n\nFret not, said Tim Collins, a Bell Pottinger managing director, per transcripts published by The Independent, a British newspaper. After the company applied its tech wizardry, \u201cYou get to the point where even if they type in \u2018Uzbek child labour\u2019 or \u2018Uzbek human rights violation,\u2019 some of the first results that come up are sites talking about what you guys are doing to address and improve that, not just the critical voices saying how terrible this all is.\u201d\n\nMr. Bell never challenged the transcripts, but he denounced the sting at the time as an \u201cunethical, underhand deception to manufacture a story where none exists.\u201d\n\nBeginning of the End\n\nBell Pottinger\u2019s slide into oblivion began with a visit to the Guptas in January 2016. Mr. Bell, who had worked in South Africa for years, said he had no idea what the brothers wanted, but he and several colleagues flew to Johannesburg to find out.\n\n\u201cWe went to this bloody great mansion, which seemed to be their headquarters,\u201d Mr. Bell recalled. \u201cGreat big room, huge sofas all over the place. Servants. Appalling, all of it.\u201d\n\nThe family already had a fortune, Tony Gupta told the small entourage. Now, he and his brothers wanted to help poor blacks. To that end, they wanted a P.R. campaign that pushed the idea of economic emancipation.\n\n\u201cSo we went back to London and wrote a strategy,\u201d said Mr. Bell. \u201cTown hall meetings, marching in the street, that kind of thing. Draw attention to the economic imbalance, then tell people they should protest and demand change.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe company drafted a two-page proposal, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times. Among its recommendations was \u201ca non-party political narrative around the existence of economic apartheid\u201d that Bell Pottinger would package \u201cinto speeches, news releases, website content, videos/broadcast content, slogans and other material required.\u201d\n\nSoon, the Guptas said that their company needed communications help, too. Most South Africans, the Guptas maintained, had an inflated notion of how much of the family\u2019s revenue came from government contracts, which harmed their interests, several Bell Pottinger employees recalled.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe corporate campaign was the first sign that altruism had little to do with the \u00a3100,000 a month that Bell Pottinger would earn during what was initially a three-month project. The second was the anger of the company\u2019s other South Africa clients when they learned of the arrangement.\n\nThe billionaire Johann Rupert was aghast to suddenly find himself one of the most prominent examples of \u201cwhite monopoly capital.\u201d He texted Mr. Bell and asked how his P.R. firm could also be working for a family that was bashing him. Mr. Bell, by his own account, quickly lost enthusiasm for the Gupta project.\n\n\u201cIt was altogether smelly,\u201d he said of the racial element of the work. But he quickly added that ethics were not the issue. If enough South African clients quit Bell Pottinger, he reasoned, the losses would outweigh the Guptas\u2019s checks. \u201cI was saying it\u2019s not a commercially sensible thing to do.\u201d\n\nBut by the end of March, only one client \u2014 the banking and asset management company Investec \u2014 had severed ties with the P.R. firm. After that, Bell Pottinger tried to find middle ground by signing a new contract with the Guptas, this time with a codicil literally called an anti-embarrassment clause. It allowed the firm to terminate the account \u201cwithout notice\u201d if the brothers brought discredit to the business.\n\nMr. Bell said he soon resolved to quit the company because he felt undermined and undervalued by Mr. Henderson. \u201cHe made my life a misery from start to finish,\u201d said Mr. Bell, speaking one recent afternoon in the living room of his home near London\u2019s Sloane Square. After negotiating a \u00a33.5 million exit package, Mr. Bell resigned in August 2016.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor his part, Mr. Henderson declined in a recent interview to indulge in the put-downs that come so easily to his antagonist. Seated at a conference table in temporary offices in Mayfair, where he is starting a new P.R. firm, he said Bell Pottinger\u2019s dissolution was too recent to discuss.\n\n\u201cI have huge empathy for all those impacted,\u201d he said, \u201cand believe now is not the appropriate time to go into details.\u201d\n\nInflaming Tensions\n\nThe P.R. campaign in South Africa, which started in 2016, was intended to raise the temperature of race relations. And it worked.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore than 100 fake Twitter accounts were created, all of them retweeting content from other Twitter accounts with names like @economycapture, according to media reports. Popular hashtags included #WhiteMonopolyCapital and #RespectGuptas. The campaign involved some 220,000 tweets.\n\nThere were also attack website with names like WMC Leaks and WMC Scams. Another part of this ecosystem were mainstream media outlets owned by the Guptas, like ANN7, a 24-hour news channel, and The New Age, a daily newspaper.\n\nAs the campaign spread, leaders at groups like the A.N.C. Youth League gave inflammatory speeches, decrying the \u201cstranglehold\u201d that rich whites had on the economy. Leaked emails would later show that the groups received media training, and in some cases funds, from Oakbay.\n\nAn atmosphere of menace slowly pervaded the country. In July 2016, the police minister announced the creation of a task force to investigate the murder of more than a dozen political figures. In the run-up to municipal elections that year, Mr. Zuma described the Democratic Alliance, the A.N.C.\u2019s main rival, as a \u201cwhite party,\u201d adding that it could not \u201crun this country no matter how they cover up by getting a few black stooges.\u201d\n\nNew and radical groups like Black First Land First sprang up, holding public rallies to fulminate against whites. At one, in May 2016, a pastor named Xola Skosana told the crowd, \u201cWe have been wounded beyond measure. Let us find the pillars and bring the house down. Black people must be avenged.\u201d\n\nFor the first time in years, whites felt a rising sense of personal danger. Nicholas Wolpe, a white South African whose father was a pioneer of the anti-apartheid movement, remembers a palpable anxiety. \u201cThere was a shift toward intolerance,\u201d he said. \u201cGradually, the debate about white monopoly capital was everywhere and the people talking about it were loud and belligerent. It struck a nerve.\u201d\n\nIn a related and surreptitious campaign, the Guptas were being recast as warmhearted people eager to help the downtrodden. A website connected to Black First Land First ran editorials defending the brothers, suggesting in one that they should be \u201cpraised for saving jobs.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["africa", "firm", "despots", "south", "main", "met", "reading", "mr", "pottinger", "rogues", "bell", "end", "campaign", "pr", "company", "guptas"], "polarity": 0.05728090899659527, "subjectivity": 0.3829289628309236},

Often, this work is done by women who are later overlooked; in the case of the civil rights struggle, for instance, women like Jo Ann Robinson and Georgia Gilmore fund-raised for and organized the Montgomery bus boycott.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIn minimizing the grass-roots work of women, the framing of white supremacist politics was no different. Just as Ms. Robinson and Ms. Gilmore led the 1955-56 boycott of buses in Alabama, in the 1970s, women like Louise Day Hicks led the antibusing crusades in the North, in an effort to avoid the desegregation of Boston public schools. While men debated in legislative chambers and listened to challenges on the bench, women headed to school cafeterias, playgrounds and PTA meetings, doing the bulk of the behind-the-scenes work of supporting the politics of segregation.\n\nWhite women organized precinct gatherings to pressure their politicians to uphold Jim Crow laws. They transformed their homes into centers of bureaucratic efficiency \u2014 copying fliers, assigning neighborhoods for petition drives and scheduling protest shifts at elementary schools and bus garages.\n\nIt was also women who shaped the way segregation, white supremacy and ideas about racial identity were knitted into the fabric of their communities. Working as midwives, teachers and social workers, women policed the racial identity of babies, students and clients to ensure that the dividing line between white and black remained intact. And across the nation, women-led groups like Patriotic American Youth and the Women for Constitutional Government and Pro America spread the message to the next generation that opposition to racial equality was about states\u2019 rights and limited government, not white supremacy.\n\nIf narratives about white supremacy have been shaped by the overwhelmingly masculine lens through which we examine practically all political movements, there are also aspects of white supremacy that make it different. One critical factor here is the central role ascribed to white male sexual and status anxiety and lust for dominance in fomenting organized white-supremacist activities. As part of arguments against desegregation, many who belonged to these movements embraced a narrative that saw white women and girls as vulnerable (to black men), and white men as protectors \u2014 a story line that simultaneously elevated white men and rendered women helpmates and beneficiaries, not activists.\n\nBut this broader narrative obscures and even gives cover to the ways white women sometimes used white supremacy for their own gain. The suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt in the early 20th century argued for women\u2019s voting rights in Southern states on the basis that \u201cwhite supremacy will be strengthened, not weakened, by white women\u2019s suffrage.\u201d In the 1920s, the journalist Nell Battle Lewis of North Carolina never questioned the absolute need for racial segregation even as she criticized the violence committed in the name of Jim Crow. Staying in the racial fold, she was afforded the opportunity to blast her state\u2019s regressive labor and gender politics. Being a white supremacist, even a liberal one, meant that she remained part of the conversation.\n\nThe point, here, is neither to catalog nor to celebrate white women\u2019s contributions to white supremacist politics. Instead, their work should change how we understand history. It is easy to denounce the racist pronouncements and white-supremacist politics of a George Wallace or a Roy Moore. But what white women teach us is that white-supremacist politics is sustained at a much more grass-roots level by our neighbors, school boards and even friends. White women have made white supremacy a much more formidable and long-lasting force in American society, sustaining it at both the local and national levels.\n\nToday, it seems, the story America prefers to tell itself about white supremacy has changed little since the middle of the century: Instead of Klan lynchings, we focus on the rally in Charlottesville; instead of George Wallace, we focus on Jeff Sessions or, for that matter, Donald Trump. Outrage over the violence and rhetoric of these men buries an equally important and certainly more intransigent story of longstanding grass-roots and national campaigns populated partly by white women who aim to maintain racial and economic inequities on the American landscape. If we begin to consider their staying power with seriousness rather than surprise \u2014 a surprise not shared by black women \u2014 perhaps we can more effectively prepare to counter this strand of American politics.", "keywords": ["womens", "power", "white", "work", "women", "racial", "american", "supremacy", "politics", "men", "whitesupremacist"], "polarity": 0.08455011423761423, "subjectivity": 0.23956078643578646},

But a new analysis from the Center for New York City Affairs at the New School takes a closer look by mapping the achievement gaps within each public elementary school in New York City. The results reveal the challenges of integrating students across the system, and of integrating under one roof.\n\nThe study is a snapshot that looks at student performance on a single test, the state math assessment given in 2016 to third through fifth graders. At each school, it looks at the race of the test takers and estimates their household income using census information about where they live.\n\nThe report illustrates how closely race, income and academic performance are tied in this city. Almost all students in the study with estimated household incomes below $30,000 were black or Hispanic, while students with household incomes above $80,000 were predominantly white. And the poorer students were, the lower they tended to score on the test, even when they went to the same school as wealthier children.\n\nTake P.S. 8, the Robert Fulton school in Brooklyn Heights, which the Center for American Progress identified last year as having one of the richest Parent Teacher Associations in the country, and which has a relatively diverse student body. While 64 percent of its students passed the state math test in 2016, compared with 36 percent of students citywide, black students at the school were nearly a full proficiency level behind their white peers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBlack students at the school also had significantly lower estimated incomes than white students.\n\nNicole Mader, the co-author of the study, said the lingering achievement gap demonstrates that just having different kinds of students together in the same building is not enough to have true integration.

Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orban, and the right-wing government he leads, have been on the offensive since then over the European Union\u2019s migration policies, which require member states to resettle a quota of refugees.

The movie, focused on one of Marvel\u2019s lesser-known superheroes and set in the fictional country of Wakanda, will be playing in 70 percent of the world by Friday, with its rollout having started on Tuesday in the United Kingdom.\n\nBut even if \u201cBlack Panther\u201d stumbles in some countries, it will easily become the top-grossing film by a black director and with a largely black cast in Hollywood history, surpassing \u201cStraight Outta Compton,\u201d which took in $214 million worldwide in 2015, after adjusting for inflation. \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d directed by Ryan Coogler, will also break box office records in North America, where ticket sales between Friday and Monday are expected to total about $165 million, an astounding start for a film released outside the holiday and summer corridors.\n\nThe record-holder for a February release is \u201cDeadpool,\u201d which arrived to an adjusted $159 million in 2016 and itself challenged conventional wisdom, proving that an R-rated superhero movie could strike a broad chord. \u201cDeadpool\u201d went on to collect an adjusted $819 million for 20th Century Fox, which will release a sequel in May.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnother test will come on March 16, when 20th Century Fox releases \u201cLove, Simon,\u201d a $17 million romantic comedy centered on a gay teenager. Studios have long insisted that multiplex crowds will not support same-sex love stories, dismissing \u201cBrokeback Mountain,\u201d which took in $231 million in 2005 for Focus Features, after adjusting for inflation, as an Oscar-boosted exception to the rule. Fox is the first major studio to take a chance on a movie anchored by a gay character in memory.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m done living in a world where I don\u2019t get to be who I am,\u201d Nick Robinson, playing the lead role, says in the \u201cLove, Simon\u201d trailer. \u201cI deserve a great love story.\u201d\n\nStudio chiefs keep their jobs by delivering hits, and they try to do that by avoiding constructs that have fizzled in the past. For years, female superheroes were held back by the argument \u2014 a ridiculous one in the eyes of many critics \u2014 that male ticket buyers would stay home if a woman led the action. The failures of the critically derided films \u201cCatwoman\u201d in 2004 and \u201cElektra\u201d in 2005 were used as proof. As studios have become more reliant on overseas ticket sales, they have shunned movies that focus on black characters by citing lackluster foreign interest in films like \u201cDreamgirls\u201d in 2007 and Tyler Perry\u2019s \u201cMadea\u201d series.\n\nSome film executives even cite \u201cGet Out\u201d as a cautionary example. That Oscar-nominated horror movie, about racism in the liberal white suburbs, collected a robust $176 million in North America but a comparatively slight $79 million overseas.\n\nAs studios embrace a wider variety of stories with more diverse casts, they have had to confront pockets of racism, sexism and homophobia. Internet trolls tried to use Facebook to organize a campaign to falsely drag down scores for \u201cBlack Panther\u201d on the influential review site Rotten Tomatoes. Some men had a conniption when a Texas theater organized all-women screenings for \u201cWonder Woman.\u201d An Alabama theater banned Disney\u2019s live-action \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d over a gay sidekick character, creating a media frenzy.\n\nPhoto\n\nDisney\u2019s willingness to withstand that kind of resistance reflects the emphasis that Robert A. Iger, the company\u2019s chief executive, has put on diverse casting and storytelling across the Magic Kingdom. As he said at Disney\u2019s most recent shareholder meeting, referring to inclusion and equality: \u201cWe can take those values, which we deem important societally, and actually change peoples\u2019 behavior \u2014 get people to be more accepting of the multiple differences and cultures and races and all other facets of our lives and our people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKevin Feige, president of Marvel Studios, and Alan H. Horn, Disney\u2019s movie chairman, were eager to make \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d But it was ultimately Mr. Iger who pushed the movie ahead, overruling those who worried that it would not generate adequate sales of related toys.\n\n\u201cIt became a company initiative as led by Bob,\u201d Mr. Feige said. \u201cHe holds a lot of sway, as you might imagine.\u201d (\u201cBlack Panther,\u201d for the record, ended up with the largest merchandise line ever for a Marvel nonsequel.)\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Townships have gotten electricity and more modern housing. Government contracts have been set aside for black would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nThese programs have had an impact, improving material conditions and generating jobs.\n\nThey have also been riddled with corruption.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt local governments across South Africa, bureaucrats have abused their authority to steer contracts to companies that put cash in their pockets. At every level of society, people have grown accustomed to kickbacks and political connections determining who prospers, and who goes without.\n\nMr. Zuma\u2019s demise resonates as a sign of a potential new order taking shape. He will forever be linked to his association with the Guptas, three Indian-born brothers who effectively bought key levers of governmental power, amassing influence so comprehensive that it became known as \u201cstate capture.\u201d\n\nHis resignation has raised hopes that South Africa is finally contending with its epidemic of corruption. That view gained momentum when an elite police unit raided a home belonging to the Guptas nearly at the same moment that Mr. Ramaphosa was assuming office.\n\nThe new president is a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle, a former deputy president and chairman of the National Planning Commission, a focal point for thinking about how to engineer economic growth.

At the time, Mr. Ramaphosa occupied a seat on the board of Lonmin, the company that owned the mine. Emails soon surfaced showing that, a day before the police opened fire, Mr. Ramaphosa had been urging senior government officials to take strong action to end the strike.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, no corruption charges have stuck to the new president, who now claims a mandate to clean up the toxic mess left behind by Mr. Zuma.\n\nSome doubt whether the A.N.C. can be salvaged as an effective vehicle for egalitarian policymaking. The party\u2019s executive ranks include many figures implicated in corruption. Mr. Ramaphosa, 65, may champion new initiatives aimed at generating economic growth, yet he finds himself relying on his party brethren to execute his visions, with no certainty that the money will land where intended.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think that taking the president out does much to dismantle the patronage network,\u201d said Ayabonga Cawe, a development economist at Xesibe Holdings, a research and advisory firm in Johannesburg. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need a lot more than taking out the guy at the top.\u201d\n\nAbove all, Mr. Ramaphosa must contend with the structural defects that have long constrained South Africa\u2019s economy, a legacy of apartheid.\n\nBeyond its systemic discrimination against black people, apartheid severed the country from much of the global economy. It ensured that huge numbers of uneducated black South Africans were available at poverty-level wages within major sectors of the economy like mining, agriculture and textiles. That cushioned domestic companies from the pressure to modernize.\n\nPhoto\n\nInternational sanctions isolated South Africa, shielding its firms from competition against multinational rivals. Sanctions also denied South African companies the ability to operate abroad, giving them an incentive to focus on the domestic market. The apartheid-era government obliged with subsidies for favored firms while allowing companies to pursue oligopoly, free of nuisances like antitrust law.\n\nThe result was a system in which large industries, from retail to furniture-making to chemicals, were dominated by huge enterprises whose core strength was the ability to protect themselves against competition. That system has largely prevailed, with smaller companies and start-ups facing often-impossible odds.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cApartheid was a system that lends itself to large conglomerates and concentrations of wealth in the hands of a few,\u201d Mr. Cawe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the corruption. It\u2019s about all of these parallel networks in big business that you need to dismantle. Most of those are white.\u201d\n\nHere is a world that Mr. Ramaphosa knows keenly, having achieved extraordinary affluence by running South African companies with interests in mining, banking, real estate and telecommunications. His fortune has been estimated at $450 million.\n\nIf he is serious about reinvigorating the economy and creating a space for black-owned small businesses, he will need to take on the prevailing structure that made him so wealthy.\n\nHis success on that front may be even more decisive than whether he can tame corruption.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly the most optimistic moment for South Africa in a very long time,\u201d said Mr. Goldin, the former adviser to Mr. Mandela. \u201cIn a way, it does feel like a new beginning.

The aggressive pace of deportations of immigrants of color, the elimination of the DACA program protecting immigrant children and the proposals propounded by the anti-immigration voices in the administration will all have the undeniable effect of slowing the rapid racial diversification of the United States population. Despite this sweeping attempt at racial social engineering, few voices in progressive and Democratic circles are responding with the kinds of outrage that one would expect.\n\nThe pro-white preferences of Donald Trump and his administration, especially when it comes to immigration, are legion. From the day he opened his presidential campaign in 2015 by demonizing Mexicans to the enthusiasm generated by the calls for building a wall along the Mexican border to aggressively ramping up deportations of immigrants of color to eliminating DACA to vulgarly denigrating African nations and Haiti, this administration has been quite clear about its preference for white people.\n\nIt should be no surprise, then, that the immigration policies championed by the White House would all have the effect of reducing the number of people of color coming into the country. A recent study by The Washington Post found that the administration\u2019s proposals to curtail legal immigration by limiting family reunification would slightly delay the date when whites become a minority. \u201cBy greatly slashing the number of Hispanic and black African immigrants entering America, this proposal would reshape the future United States,\u201d the economist Michael Clemens said.\n\n\u201cDecades ahead,\u201d he added, \u201cmany fewer of us would be nonwhite or have nonwhite people in our families.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe administration\u2019s focus is not random.

The very first immigration law passed, the Naturalization Act of 1790, declared that to become a citizen, one had to be a \u201cfree white person.\u201d That demarcation was the explicit law of the land for the next 162 years, until 1952. There are 20th-century Supreme Court cases explicitly holding that Asian immigrants could not become United States citizens because they were not white.

For the truth is that Mr. Zuma and his allies were corrupt partly because they felt a sense of grievance intimately connected to their experience of race.\n\nWhen Mr. Zuma became president of South Africa in 2009, he rallied behind him an alliance of people who felt themselves to be marginal and neglected, not just in relation to the world economic order or white South Africa but also in relation to the A.N.C. itself. The A.N.C. has been run by people drawn from the ranks of an urbane, cosmopolitan elite.\n\nMr. Zuma represented a dramatic change in this tradition. Although he spent years in exile and climbed the ranks of the A.N.C., his biography was unlike any of his predecessors\u2019. Nelson Mandela was born into royalty. Thabo Mbeki was the son of prominent intellectuals. Mr. Zuma\u2019s mother worked in the kitchen of a white family and was too poor to provide her son with a formal education. He grew up herding cattle in the hinterland.\n\nWhen he came to power in 2009, he did so with the support of organizations representing much of the urban working class \u2014 the country\u2019s largest trade union and the South African Communist Party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut he soon dropped these organizations and turned for support to rural South Africa, in particular to traditional leaders and to the elites of far-flung provincial capitals. They carried with them into power an abiding sense of powerlessness, a feeling that the very institutions they now controlled were alien and belonged to others. In office, they believed that they had entered into their enemy\u2019s mansion. It seemed to be payback time.\n\nIn a speech delivered to a room of black businesspeople in December 2016, Mr. Zuma warned of the sophisticated ways in which the enemy confuses black people. One source of such confusion was the prevailing economic orthodoxy. Mr. Zuma suggested that the most fundamental of economic laws was merely nominal; remove the scales from our eyes and we see that so-called economic laws are a ruse invented by the powerful.\n\nHis genre of criminality is light-years from the sort that characterized the apartheid state. The corruption of apartheid\u2019s leaders stemmed from arrogance; they believed that they could control the world forever. Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption stems from the grievances of a man who feels very small.\n\nThis sense of grievance was on display in the last words he uttered publicly as president. In a swipe at his successor, Mr. Ramaphosa, Mr. Zuma suggested that those in the party who had unseated him were \u201cserving the interests of the oppressors of yesteryear, who joyfully celebrate as we lynch one another.\u201d\n\nBlack nationalism in South Africa has many faces. Mr. Ramaphosa represents a strand that is bourgeois, worldly and comfortable with power. There is also a militant, socialist strand of black nationalism, but it is on the wane. And there is the strand represented by Mr. Zuma, who governed as a man shaped and distorted by the violence and oppression of white supremacy.\n\nI am of course alive to the irony of a white South African like me saying that a black president\u2019s corruption was motivated by racial grievance. Many South Africans, black and white, would regard this argument as an excuse for the intolerable. But we should be honest enough to accept that even now, notwithstanding that apartheid has been gone since before nearly half the South African population was born, the legacy of white supremacy has lived on in the man who was president.", "keywords": ["africa", "distinctive", "white", "south", "apartheid", "zumas", "zuma", "mr", "mess", "black", "whats", "corruption", "jacob", "economic"], "polarity": 0.0616115067727971, "subjectivity": 0.37158776707163793},

These pictures, made over many years, contain what the scholar and curator Okwui Enwezor calls \u201cthe rumor of the body.\u201d Mysteries of a jagged and deadpan sort, they would go on to influence the noirish tone of Simpson\u2019s later film work.\n\nPhoto\n\nSimpson began to set ever more intricate conceptual layers between her initial inspiration for a work and the finished product. The idea for \u201c9 Props\u201d (1995) began during a residency at the Pilchuck Glass School in Washington. With the aid of artisans at the school, she fabricated a series of dark vessels modeled on vases and other objects used in the portrait work of the pioneering Harlem photographer James Van Der Zee. But these vessels were not the final work. She shipped them back to New York and then photographed them against a plain background. And that still was not the work. Further intervention followed: She turned those photographic images into nine lithographs, which she printed on felt. Finally, she wrote captions below each lithographed vessel, describing the context in which it originally appeared. One of them, for instance, reads:\n\nDinner Party with boxer Harry Wills, 1926 James VanDerZee Harry Wills a k a \u201cThe Black Panther,\u201d boxer, businessman- sits with seven other men and women, mostly women with champagne glasses raised as a woman on his left makes a toast in his honor. There are three bottles of champagne, a crystal decanter, a bottle of port, an arrangement of flowers and fruit, and before each guest an untouched china place setting.\n\nPhoto\n\nFrom multiple directions, the work gestures at what cannot be seen: the original placement of the vessels that inspired Simpson\u2019s own, the people in the photographs by James Van Der Zee, the social life of Harlem evoked by his photographs and the complexity of manners and class implied by them. All that vanished world of culture and experience is reduced to an elegant grid, as simple as an antiquarian\u2019s catalog, a thought picture that demands calm engagement and imaginative intervention on the viewer\u2019s part. Without being representational, it is about race; but race is not off in some category by itself, hemmed in only by questions of skin color, separate from life.\n\n\u201cRepresent!\u201d in the black American sense means standing up for your people, expressing solidarity and letting a shared ethos underwrite your presence and work. It is an exhortation, a greeting and a farewell. The word also has more conventional associations. In the visual arts, it is contrasted with the abstract or the symbolic. To represent, in this more common sense, is to make work that visually corresponds to realities out there in the world: to illustrate uncomplicatedly. This second sense of \u201crepresent\u201d is enjoying a vogue in the art world. Realism is back. This is welcome: after so long an absence of black figures and black faces in art museums, they are now being seen more frequently. Many artists, black and otherwise, are depicting the black body. It is necessary and often successful. Just as often, it fails when it is little more than a clumsy shorthand for socially concerned art, unobjectionable and unimpressive.\n\nA strong appeal of Simpson\u2019s work is that she has always embraced the inherent complexity of blackness, her own blackness as well as the blackness that runs ineluctably through American history. She does not reject representational depictions, but neither does she feel the need to confine herself only to \u201crace\u201d work. When an artist uses a black model, she is presenting a human question by foregrounding a human presence. Is a white man a person while a black woman is and can only be a gendered and racialized subject? As the scholar Kellie Jones has pointed out, nonwhite bodies are often thought of as \u201cnot neutral enough for the dispassionate formulas thought to constitute conceptual practice.\u201d If a black woman\u2019s race and gender are the only things apparent to certain viewers, Simpson seems to say, the ethical responsibility to escape those shackles is the viewer\u2019s.\n\nFreedom is Lorna Simpson\u2019s starting point and her permanent theme. A humane current animates all of her work, a current that neither sidesteps nor confines itself to race. Her work is simultaneously about the \u201cneutral\u201d space of ideas and the particularized experience of the body. \u201cMontage\u201d is photographic and painterly, a riff on a pair of found photographs, sequenced to look like a giant strip of film. It deals with dreams and nightmares, ambiguities and vulnerabilities. At its heart is what Simpson calls \u201cthe push and pull of photography\u201d: the stuttering potential inherent in mechanical reproduction and the imperfect registrations that mirror subconscious life. It is a rapid response to the current political climate, situating a crucial part of it in the most intimate space of all, where the hectoring \u201cthey\u201d is temporarily held at bay in favor of the puzzled \u201cI.\u201d In your own sleeping bed, images persist and words are hard to come by. It is the art we need now: rich, allusive, tongue-tied and unanswerable.", "keywords": ["images", "world", "seen", "race", "began", "cant", "simpson", "woman", "black", "evoking", "simpsons", "work", "art"], "polarity": 0.06682087932087931, "subjectivity": 0.4861752986752985},

To some extent, there\u2019s always been an adversarial role between the White House and reporters. How do you feel about the tenor of things now? It used to be friendly-adversarial. There would be retaliation for stories they didn\u2019t like, but nothing compared with this. There\u2019s a war going on. For a president to come out with the term \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 he\u2019s putting targets on our heads. He has moved the goal posts when it comes to how politicians and people deal with the press.\n\nWhat\u2019s the value of the White House press briefing? Transparency. There is a veil on the White House; people want to look behind the curtain. It\u2019s their house. When you open up a press briefing to see the back and forth, you\u2019re getting more in the weeds of what\u2019s going on, beyond just the quote we may put in the story. This is a key piece that I don\u2019t think people really get: When you talk about the press, it\u2019s not about journalists; it\u2019s about the free-flowing information that the American public is supposed to get. When you bash the press, you\u2019re bashing the idea of getting truth out.\n\nWhat\u2019s the public opinion of the White House press corps? It depends on whom you talk to. We\u2019re so tribal now. There used to be a day when you didn\u2019t know the person\u2019s politics. The line has been obscured between facts and opinion. I think it started during the Clinton years, and it just kept getting progressively worse. People don\u2019t want to just hear the news; they want to hear what people have to say about it too.\n\nYour reactions during the televised briefings have generated memes. Has it made you more self-conscious? I\u2019m so sad about that. My boss has always said, \u201cYou need to know how to play poker.\u201d I don\u2019t. I\u2019m trying! The last time I was really caught off guard was when Sarah Huckabee Sanders said something about people\u2019s minds being in the gutter after President Trump\u2019s tweet about Kirsten Gillibrand. I really get into those briefings. I really try to listen. I don\u2019t play to the camera. I go in there, and I\u2019m really earnest. So when she said that, I was shocked! I was like, No, God, that was a little bit much.\n\nGiven how much you tangle with this particular administration, why do you think you get called on so much? Have you felt like a target? Yes, I have. But I have to shake that off, because I have to go in and do my job. I cover the White House. I cover all issues, particularly those that affect black and brown Americans. Now, what if they didn\u2019t call on me? A certain segment of America would not get the answers to some of their pressing questions. If I don\u2019t ask, who will?\n\nRyan is the White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks and a political analyst for CNN.

You had to ask whether this president believed slavery was wrong. I recently asked him, \u201cAre you a racist?\u201d It\u2019s a sad day when you have to ask a sitting president that. There has been a series of comments or lack of action, from calling Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas\u201d to how he dealt with Charlottesville to his comments on Norway versus Haiti, Africa, El Salvador, black and brown nations. It\u2019s not been one thing. It\u2019s been a pattern. So I asked. He did not answer, which I thought was a wasted moment. He could have put it to rest right then and there and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a racist.\u201d But it took him days to say that.\n\nYou said it seems as if it has changed, going forward, how the White House deals with the press corps and wields its power. What do you think this means for the next president you cover? He\u2019ll clamp down harder on us. Each president has pushed us further away from access. Who knows what will happen or what another president may want? They may not want to be followed. President Obama didn\u2019t like being followed, for example. This president hates us.

Just like our kid who\u2019s not white dresses up like Captain America. I think the beautiful thing about comics is they do transcend race in a lot of ways.\u201d\n\nMary Dimacali, 29, a social media and marketing manager in Rockland County, New York, echoed that idea. She does not believe that her fianc\u00e9\u2019s 7-year-old son, Sawyer, who is white, sees the film or its characters through the lens of race. Sawyer himself, during the interview with Ms. Dimacali, said, \u201csure,\u201d when she asked if he\u2019d like to dress up as Black Panther.\n\n\u201cFor a white kid to be so open and judge based on the character\u2019s story and the personality and history, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s important,\u201d she said. \u201cBut on the flip side, I think it\u2019s also great to have a black superhero you can identify and connect to.\u201d\n\nThe character\u2019s history is unique. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1966, Black Panther rules as the king of an African technological utopia known as Wakanda.

He is completing \u201cRise of the Black Panther,\u201d a six-part comic series for Marvel that traces the character\u2019s early history. He has tried to explain some of that history to his 7-year-old daughter, but without delving too deeply into complex concepts like Western imperialism, which she may struggle to grasp.\n\n\u201cYou want that white kid to be able to think that he can dress up in a Black Panther costume, because, to that kid, there\u2019s no difference between Captain America and Black Panther,\u201d Mr. Narcisse, 45, said. But, he added, it also involves \u201ctrying to explain what is special about T\u2019Challa and Wakanda without racism.

She believes that parents in general, and white parents in particular, are reluctant to talk about race with young children. When they do, they often miss the chance to talk about inequality, even though research supports the idea that children develop an awareness of race and difference at a very young age.\n\nMs. Vittrup was careful to add that dressing as Black Panther isn\u2019t inherently appropriative or offensive. The character comes from an invented African country, and to wear his mask isn\u2019t quite the same as wearing blackface. However, in a moment where even more black heroes, like Luke Cage and Black Lightning, are finding their way into the limelight, Black Panther\u2019s relationship with the black community and its history creates an opportunity to teach nonblack children about the black experience.\n\n\u201cKids are not colorblind,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of structural inequality in our society, and kids are noticing that.

Even the clothes are an 18th-century version of current POTUS style: basic black suit and fat tie. As for Washington, he stands blank-faced, one arm extended, like a tenor taking a dignified bow.\n\n[Read remarks from the Obamas and the artists. ]\n\nUninflected dignity was the attitude of choice for well over a century, with a few breaks. In an 1836 portrait, Andrew Jackson, a demonstrative bully, sports a floor-length, red-silk-lined Dracula cloak and a kind of topiary bouffant. (A picture of Jackson, one of President Trump\u2019s populist heroes, hangs in the Oval Office.) Abraham Lincoln, seen in several likenesses, is exceptional for looking as if he may actually have weighty matters on his mind. Most of the portraits that precede and follow his are pure P.R.\n\nThis continues well into the 20th century. In a 1980 painting Jimmy Carter trades a black suit for a beige one. How revolutionary is that? And there\u2019s a Casual Fridays vogue: Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both go tieless for it. Under the circumstances, Elaine de Kooning\u2019s 1963 portrait of John F. Kennedy, a fanfare of green and blue strokes, hits like a boost of adrenaline. Rousing too, though not in a good way, is a big head shot image of Bill Clinton by the artist Chuck Close. Using his signature mosaic-like painting technique, Mr. Close turns the 42nd president into a pixelated clown.\n\nMr. Obama has much better luck with his similarly high-profile portraitist. Mr. Wiley, born in Los Angeles in 1977, gained a following in the early 2000s with his crisp, glossy, life-size paintings of young African-American men dressed in hip-hop styles, but depicted in the old-master manner of European royal portraits. More recently he has expanded his repertoire to include female subjects, as well as models from Brazil, India, Nigeria and Senegal, creating the collective image of a global black aristocracy.\n\nIn an imposingly scaled painting \u2014 just over seven feet tall \u2014 the artist presents Mr. Obama dressed in the regulation black suit and an open-necked white shirt, and seated on a vaguely thronelike chair not so different from the one seen in Stuart\u2019s Washington portrait. But art historical references stop there. So do tonal echoes of past portraits. Whereas Mr. Obama\u2019s predecessors are, to the man, shown expressionless and composed, Mr. Obama sits tensely forward, frowning, elbows on his knees, arms crossed, as if listening hard. No smiles, no Mr. Nice Guy. He\u2019s still troubleshooting, still in the game.\n\nVideo\n\nHis engaged and assertive demeanor contradicts \u2014 and cosmetically corrects \u2014 the impression he often made in office of being philosophically detached from what was going on around him. At some level, all portraits are propaganda, political or personal. And what makes this one distinctive is the personal part. Mr. Wiley has set Mr. Obama against \u2014 really embedded him in \u2014 a bower of what looks like ground cover. From the greenery sprout flowers that have symbolic meaning for the sitter. African blue lilies represent Kenya, his father\u2019s birthplace; jasmine stands for Hawaii, where Mr. Obama himself was born; chrysanthemums, the official flower of Chicago, reference the city where his political career began, and where he met his wife.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMrs. Obama\u2019s choice of Ms. Sherald as an artist was an enterprising one. Ms. Sherald, who was born in Columbus, Ga., in 1973 and lives in Baltimore, is just beginning to move into the national spotlight after putting her career on hold for some years to deal with a family health crisis, and one of her own. (She had a heart transplant at 39.) Production-wise, she and Mr. Wiley operate quite differently. He runs the equivalent of a multinational art factory, with assistants churning out work. Ms. Sherald, who until a few years ago made her living waiting tables, oversees a studio staff of one, herself.\n\nAt the same time, they have much in common. Both focused early on African-American portraiture precisely because it is so little represented in Western art history. And both tend to blend fact and fiction. Mr. Wiley, with photo-realistic precision, casts actual people in fantastically heroic roles. (He modifies his heroizing in the case of Mr. Obama, but it\u2019s still there.) Ms. Sherald also starts with realism, but softens and abstracts it. She gives all her figures gray-toned skin \u2014 a color with ambiguous racial associations \u2014 and reduces bodies to geometric forms silhouetted against single-color fields.\n\nShe shows Mrs. Obama sitting against a field of light blue, wearing a spreading gown. The dress design, by Michelle Smith, is eye-teasingly complicated: mostly white interrupted by black Op Art-ish blips and patches of striped color suggestive of African textiles. The shape of the dress, rising pyramidally upward, mountain-like, feels as if it were the real subject of the portrait. Mrs. Obama\u2019s face forms the composition\u2019s peak, but could be almost anyone\u2019s face, like a model\u2019s face in a fashion spread. To be honest, I was anticipating \u2014 hoping for \u2014 a bolder, more incisive image of the strong-voiced person I imagine this former first lady to be.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m wishing, let me mention something more. Mr. Obama\u2019s portrait will be installed, long-term, among those of his presidential peers, in a dedicated space on the second floor. Mrs. Obama\u2019s will hang in a corridor reserved for temporary displays of new acquisitions \u2014 on the first floor. It will stay there until November, after which there\u2019s no set-aside place for it to land.\n\nIf first men have an acknowledged showcase, first women \u2014 ladies or not \u2014 should too. Better, they should all be together, sharing space, offering a welcoming environment to, among others, a future first female president, and creating a lasting monument to #MeToo.", "keywords": ["paint", "portrait", "obamas", "washington", "fiction", "fact", "blend", "mr", "black", "ms", "wiley", "portraits", "sherald", "obama", "politics"], "polarity": 0.07208600786186993, "subjectivity": 0.35921572042261696},

While it is true that compared with Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton lost ground with that segment of the electorate, the clues to a new Democratic majority may be found in the coalition that elected Mr. Northam governor of Virginia, or perhaps more accurately, voted against Mr. Gillespie and his immigrant bashing.\n\nIn Virginia, polling data has made it clear that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 rhetoric backfired among minority voters as well as, crucially, among many whites. Mr. Northam won a majority of white college-educated voters, who made up a larger share of the electorate in 2017 than they did in 2016. Mr. Gillespie matched Mr. Trump with noncollege whites, but their turnout was down. And minority voters in 2017 matched their 2016 electorate share \u2014 for the first time ever there was no drop-off from the presidential to the gubernatorial election. The Democrats also expanded their margin of victory in Virginia from five percentage points in 2016 to nine points in 2017.\n\nBefore the vote in Virginia, pundits on both the right and left were speculating that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s anti-immigrant strategy was working. But in the end, election results and polling data in Virginia proved all that thinking was wrong. While each state has its own demographics and distinct politics, Virginia has voters who span demographic and economic spectrums. Majorities of voters of all races and ethnicities rejected anti-immigrant stereotypes as ugly and wrong.\n\nAccording to an election eve survey of voters by Latino Decisions, Latino voters said that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads made them less enthusiastic about him, by a 45-point margin. But it wasn\u2019t just Latino voters. By a 23-point margin (52 to 29), whites in Virginia also said the MS-13 ads turned them away from Mr. Gillespie, as did African-American and Asian-American voters by larger margins.\n\nData speaks louder than punditry, and our regression analysis of survey data paints a clear picture. Exposure to Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads actually helped drive white college-educated voters away from the Republicans. When we analyzed findings for white independents and Republicans, voters who were aware of the MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Mr. Gillespie\u2019s Democratic opponent. What should be alarming for Republicans is that this effect wasn\u2019t limited to the governor\u2019s race. The Gillespie campaign had coattail effects, but of the wrong stripe. Across all racial groups, those who were aware of Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Democratic candidates for Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates.\n\nThis means that not only is it morally just for Democrats to position themselves as the party that stands against hatred and bigotry and in favor of inclusiveness and opportunity, but it is also a strategically sound position for winning votes. Simultaneously, it sends a clear, welcoming message to Latino, African-American and Asian-American voters, while also winning over enough of the white voters who also oppose immigrant bashing.\n\nThis phenomenon is particularly true of voters who will decide crucial House and Senate races in 2018: people of color and white college-educated voters \u2014 also known as the Democratic base. Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans are clearly gearing up for a similar anti-immigrant effort in 2018. But now the mask has been pulled off. Voters get it. Democrats have an opportunity to speak out strongly against bigotry. And in doing so, they have a path to victory in 2018 and beyond.", "keywords": ["virginia", "vote", "voters", "white", "ads", "gillespies", "immigration", "mr", "democrats", "win", "ms13", "republicans"], "polarity": 0.10965551203646441, "subjectivity": 0.4705427288760622},

{"title": "\n                    Who First Showed Us That Black Lives Matter?                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/05/opinion/black-lives-matter-philosophy.html", "text": "The Stone Who First Showed Us That Black Lives Matter? Image \u201cMan in Forest Green,\u201d 2016 Credit Derrick Adams/Tilton Gallery, New York\n\nAs a black philosopher, I am constantly navigating a path through the traditions and categories that define my profession. Most often, that navigation takes place between the canonical Western philosophy stretching back to Ancient Greece and the more recent intellectual output and contributions of previously excluded groups, including women, L.G.B.T people and African-American thinkers. This last tradition \u2014 the history of black thought \u2014 is a profound one for me; it is the foundation for my project of making sense of my place in America. But black thought\u2019s role in our struggles for emancipation and the redemption of the American dream make it the inheritance of all Americans.\n\nToday, our nation is about as racially fraught as it ever has been. Our racially lopsided incarceration rates have led the scholar Michelle Alexander to dub our period the New Jim Crow. The persistence of police-perpetrated extrajudicial killings, such as the one that left Michael Brown\u2019s dead body in the street for hours in Ferguson, Mo., has brought to mind for many observers horrific murders of black people in the past, such as the heartbreaking case of Emmett Till. Add to this a president who identifies white supremacists as \u201cfine people,\u201d and it becomes reasonable for us to wonder not only how black folks feel about these situations, but how they think about them. After all, it is our bodies that are on the line every day the sun rises on America.\n\nBlack Americans\u2019 continuous experiences with racial injustice prompt questions: What is racism, and why does it exist? How do we survive in America? And, since no one ought to live like this, what is to be done? That the black experience both motivates and unifies these questions is exactly the reason we can identify and study something called black thought. It is the intellectual tradition concerned with systematically and imaginatively studying and conveying the worst social, economic, and political treatment ever visited on a population, for nearly four centuries, and with no end in sight.\n\nOne invigorating aspect of black thought \u2014 whether it is expressed in philosophy, literature, art, film, music or dance \u2014 is its clear and direct impact on society. Tied as it is to urgent questions of human dignity, freedom and justice, its manifestations and effects can ultimately be seen everywhere from the graffiti-graced brick walls of America\u2019s inner cities to the halls of gilded centers of art and education.\n\nThe most significant manifestation of this kind since the civil rights movement is Black Lives Matter. Widely credited to Patrisse Cullors, Opal Tometi and Alicia Garza in response to Trayvon Martin\u2019s death on February 26, 2012, at the hands of George Zimmerman, and to Zimmerman\u2019s subsequent acquittal. As America began to pay more attention to police shootings of unarmed blacks, the movement\u2019s power grew. That power was derived from its simple, bold and irrefutably true proposition \u2014 that black lives do not exist for pleasurable disposal in a society still mired in its white supremacist history.\n\nYet, despite the obvious truth of that statement, we may wonder: What are the moral and political arguments that underwrite the claim that black lives matter? While there is no way to articulate the full scope of those arguments in a single essay, it\u2019s worth considering the philosophical contributions of some of the forerunners of the movement that is our most urgent manifestation of black thought today.\n\nThe end of the Civil War and the subsequent ratification of the 13th Amendment in 1865 legally abolished slavery, but blacks quickly became subject to a displaced form of violence at the hands of white supremacists across the nation who typically used false accusations of sexual assault to justify lynching black men. Police turned a blind eye to these murders, and sometimes actively facilitated them.\n\nIda B. Wells, a leading black thinker and journalist in the late-19th and early 20th centuries, and a co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, built a public career documenting lynchings and calling America to account for them. Her arguments extended and amplified those made by Frederick Douglass before her. Douglass\u2019s central claim in his seminal \u201cThe Meaning of July Fourth for the Negro\u201d was that Americans should feel shame for slavery, given their country\u2019s foundational commitment to liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We were failing our own ideals.\n\nWells pointed to the rise of lynching after the fall of slavery as not merely a legal matter to be rectified with new laws. Having fled her hometown to escape threats of her own lynching, Wells used the press to make her moral arguments. She described a nation in the grip of a dark remorse for freeing black Americans from slavery, and condemned white Americans for cruelties that violated their own commitment to the democratic project.\n\nThe horrors that Wells described were a factor in the Great Migration of blacks to the North, which fed the flourishing of black thought and cultural life that gave rise to the Harlem Renaissance. An indication that the Harlem Renaissance was always meant to be a period of radical black philosophy and social change was the name originally coined for the movement: The New Negro. Alain Locke, the Harvard-educated black intellectual who became known as the father of the Harlem Renaissance, envisioned a philosophical position that reinvigorated blacks\u2019 relationship to their culture and that would in turn solidify their status as equal co-participants in our democracy.\n\nA strong theme among some of the luminaries of the time focused on the will of blacks to assert their humanity against racism and to insist on their status as persons owed respect. Among those stars, the poet Langston Hughes was one of the brightest. His \u201cI Too\u201d is a quiet yet insistent poem depicting a black man employed by a white one and his struggle with invisibility. The protagonist resolves to sit at the table with the white folks the next day and show people how beautiful he is and that he, too, is America. The writer Zora Neale Hurston had an equally persistent but at times more playful take on the matter. In her essay \u201cHow It Feels to Be Colored Me,\u201d she wrote, \u201cSometimes, I feel discriminated against, but it does not make me angry. It merely astonishes me. How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company! It\u2019s beyond me.\u201d\n\nThinkers like Hughes and Hurston were involved in the Harlem Renaissance project of presenting a vision of black cultural vitality and worth that would rework the image of black Americans that whites typically relied upon. That stream of thought runs directly into the heart of Black Lives Matter.\n\nAnother valuable and necessary development to come out of the Black Lives Matter movement is the de-emphasizing of black patriarchy and the equal acknowledgment of the suffering of black women and the black L.G.T.B.Q. community. Though sexuality was an avenue of inquiry during the Harlem Renaissance, it was perhaps the mid- to late-20th century poet and theorist Audre Lorde who did the most to make black women\u2019s sexuality a focal point of political and social philosophy.\n\nWhile today \u201cintersectionality\u201d is bandied about as the cutting edge of social research, it was Lorde who in her writing insisted on complicating our view of personal identity by claiming that each of us belongs to multiple identity communities, all of which contribute to our sense of self and our purposes.\n\nShe also showed the broad reach of white supremacy and its effects on black Americans as they located themselves in more nuanced ways in the tapestry of American culture. For her, the primary form taken by resistance to racism was the denial of blunt categories imposed on black Americans, which stifled the possibility of an individual\u2019s full flourishing. Lorde, then, called for a radical form of self-possession whose boundaries were not open to negotiation with a white society.\n\nWhen people think of Black Lives Matter, they often think of anger feeding forceful protests. Anger is a reasonable response to racial injustice. To be certain, groups like the Black Panthers and thinkers like Malcolm X advised black Americans to get angry and take the doctrine of armed self-defense seriously. Though anger and love are not mutually exclusive emotions, James Baldwin and Martin Luther King Jr. affirmed a view of civic love to pre-empt the need for violence.\n\nKing espoused a form of Kantian regard that prioritized conceiving of every human, racist or not, as owed a kind of love that is grounded in the ideal of universal respect. Baldwin held a slightly different view. He felt black Americans ought to see whites as democratic kin or family, as people with whom blacks would have serious quarrels but also people whom it would be worth keeping close in order to strengthen and bring integrity to the bonds of shared democratic life. These two views of love eschewed violence yet insisted on militancy. While forgiveness and acceptance were hallmarks of King\u2019s and Baldwin\u2019s views, so was an unyielding commitment to self-respect and the demand for social change to institutionalize the idea that blacks were co-creators of the American kingdom.\n\nThinkers like Wells, Hughes, Hurston, Lorde and Baldwin not only anticipated the current Black Lives Matter movement but provided an intellectual blueprint to give depth and integrity to that slogan, so that its meaning transcends the demand to stop police brutality. It is a demand for whites to extend their historical imagination and recognize that the ills of racism are not the result of a few bad police officers or a few out-and-out racists in some far-off corner of America. The problem, rather, is a kind of complicity \u2014 one partaking in the false comfort that America has somehow escaped the trajectory of its racially murderous history. It is necessary that we to see our society today as continuous with that history and not anomalous to it.\n\nBlack thought\u2019s primary contribution to the academy and to American society is the richness and precision with which it describes our worst demons to us, while offering a vision of how we might each save our democracy from the ruin of irrational fear and hatred.\n\nSign up for the Opinion Today newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

Mr. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain in 1998 as part of an effort to deport him to Spain, where he had been indicted on a charge of torturing Spanish citizens.\n\nAfter two years of legal and political wrangling, Mr. Bell and his allies prevailed when Mr. Pinochet was authorized to freely return to Chile.\n\nBell Pottinger was hardly the only British outfit working for rogues and despots, as well as publicly traded companies, nor was it the largest or most profitable. But it had a buccaneering spirit that made it the firm of choice for a wide variety of missions.\n\n\n\nDuring the war in Iraq, Bell Pottinger had a contract with the Pentagon to produce propaganda for the United States military. This included scripts in Arabic for a soap opera that aired in the country, said Mr. Bell.\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen the company\u2019s client list did not generate news, its methods did. In 2011, it was caught boasting about its skills in the dark arts of search engine manipulation to people it thought were potential clients.\n\nIn fact, they were undercover members of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit organization that works with a variety of media. Posing as executives from the made-up Azimov Group, these \u201crepresentatives\u201d said the company had ties to the Uzbekistan regime, which has been criticized for repression and for using forced child labor during its cotton harvest.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Azimov executives said they worried about blowback.\n\nFret not, said Tim Collins, a Bell Pottinger managing director, per transcripts published by The Independent, a British newspaper. After the company applied its tech wizardry, \u201cYou get to the point where even if they type in \u2018Uzbek child labour\u2019 or \u2018Uzbek human rights violation,\u2019 some of the first results that come up are sites talking about what you guys are doing to address and improve that, not just the critical voices saying how terrible this all is.\u201d\n\nMr. Bell never challenged the transcripts, but he denounced the sting at the time as an \u201cunethical, underhand deception to manufacture a story where none exists.\u201d\n\nBeginning of the End\n\nBell Pottinger\u2019s slide into oblivion began with a visit to the Guptas in January 2016. Mr. Bell, who had worked in South Africa for years, said he had no idea what the brothers wanted, but he and several colleagues flew to Johannesburg to find out.\n\n\u201cWe went to this bloody great mansion, which seemed to be their headquarters,\u201d Mr. Bell recalled. \u201cGreat big room, huge sofas all over the place. Servants. Appalling, all of it.\u201d\n\nThe family already had a fortune, Tony Gupta told the small entourage. Now, he and his brothers wanted to help poor blacks. To that end, they wanted a P.R. campaign that pushed the idea of economic emancipation.\n\n\u201cSo we went back to London and wrote a strategy,\u201d said Mr. Bell. \u201cTown hall meetings, marching in the street, that kind of thing. Draw attention to the economic imbalance, then tell people they should protest and demand change.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe company drafted a two-page proposal, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times. Among its recommendations was \u201ca non-party political narrative around the existence of economic apartheid\u201d that Bell Pottinger would package \u201cinto speeches, news releases, website content, videos/broadcast content, slogans and other material required.\u201d\n\nSoon, the Guptas said that their company needed communications help, too. Most South Africans, the Guptas maintained, had an inflated notion of how much of the family\u2019s revenue came from government contracts, which harmed their interests, several Bell Pottinger employees recalled.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe corporate campaign was the first sign that altruism had little to do with the \u00a3100,000 a month that Bell Pottinger would earn during what was initially a three-month project. The second was the anger of the company\u2019s other South Africa clients when they learned of the arrangement.\n\nThe billionaire Johann Rupert was aghast to suddenly find himself one of the most prominent examples of \u201cwhite monopoly capital.\u201d He texted Mr. Bell and asked how his P.R. firm could also be working for a family that was bashing him. Mr. Bell, by his own account, quickly lost enthusiasm for the Gupta project.\n\n\u201cIt was altogether smelly,\u201d he said of the racial element of the work. But he quickly added that ethics were not the issue. If enough South African clients quit Bell Pottinger, he reasoned, the losses would outweigh the Guptas\u2019s checks. \u201cI was saying it\u2019s not a commercially sensible thing to do.\u201d\n\nBut by the end of March, only one client \u2014 the banking and asset management company Investec \u2014 had severed ties with the P.R. firm. After that, Bell Pottinger tried to find middle ground by signing a new contract with the Guptas, this time with a codicil literally called an anti-embarrassment clause. It allowed the firm to terminate the account \u201cwithout notice\u201d if the brothers brought discredit to the business.\n\nMr. Bell said he soon resolved to quit the company because he felt undermined and undervalued by Mr. Henderson. \u201cHe made my life a misery from start to finish,\u201d said Mr. Bell, speaking one recent afternoon in the living room of his home near London\u2019s Sloane Square. After negotiating a \u00a33.5 million exit package, Mr. Bell resigned in August 2016.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor his part, Mr. Henderson declined in a recent interview to indulge in the put-downs that come so easily to his antagonist. Seated at a conference table in temporary offices in Mayfair, where he is starting a new P.R. firm, he said Bell Pottinger\u2019s dissolution was too recent to discuss.\n\n\u201cI have huge empathy for all those impacted,\u201d he said, \u201cand believe now is not the appropriate time to go into details.\u201d\n\nInflaming Tensions\n\nThe P.R. campaign in South Africa, which started in 2016, was intended to raise the temperature of race relations. And it worked.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore than 100 fake Twitter accounts were created, all of them retweeting content from other Twitter accounts with names like @economycapture, according to media reports. Popular hashtags included #WhiteMonopolyCapital and #RespectGuptas. The campaign involved some 220,000 tweets.\n\nThere were also attack website with names like WMC Leaks and WMC Scams. Another part of this ecosystem were mainstream media outlets owned by the Guptas, like ANN7, a 24-hour news channel, and The New Age, a daily newspaper.\n\nAs the campaign spread, leaders at groups like the A.N.C. Youth League gave inflammatory speeches, decrying the \u201cstranglehold\u201d that rich whites had on the economy. Leaked emails would later show that the groups received media training, and in some cases funds, from Oakbay.\n\nAn atmosphere of menace slowly pervaded the country. In July 2016, the police minister announced the creation of a task force to investigate the murder of more than a dozen political figures. In the run-up to municipal elections that year, Mr. Zuma described the Democratic Alliance, the A.N.C.\u2019s main rival, as a \u201cwhite party,\u201d adding that it could not \u201crun this country no matter how they cover up by getting a few black stooges.\u201d\n\nNew and radical groups like Black First Land First sprang up, holding public rallies to fulminate against whites. At one, in May 2016, a pastor named Xola Skosana told the crowd, \u201cWe have been wounded beyond measure. Let us find the pillars and bring the house down. Black people must be avenged.\u201d\n\nFor the first time in years, whites felt a rising sense of personal danger. Nicholas Wolpe, a white South African whose father was a pioneer of the anti-apartheid movement, remembers a palpable anxiety. \u201cThere was a shift toward intolerance,\u201d he said. \u201cGradually, the debate about white monopoly capital was everywhere and the people talking about it were loud and belligerent. It struck a nerve.\u201d\n\nIn a related and surreptitious campaign, the Guptas were being recast as warmhearted people eager to help the downtrodden. A website connected to Black First Land First ran editorials defending the brothers, suggesting in one that they should be \u201cpraised for saving jobs.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["africa", "firm", "despots", "south", "main", "met", "reading", "mr", "pottinger", "rogues", "bell", "end", "campaign", "pr", "company", "guptas"], "polarity": 0.05728090899659527, "subjectivity": 0.3829289628309236},

Often, this work is done by women who are later overlooked; in the case of the civil rights struggle, for instance, women like Jo Ann Robinson and Georgia Gilmore fund-raised for and organized the Montgomery bus boycott.

Just as Ms. Robinson and Ms. Gilmore led the 1955-56 boycott of buses in Alabama, in the 1970s, women like Louise Day Hicks led the antibusing crusades in the North, in an effort to avoid the desegregation of Boston public schools. While men debated in legislative chambers and listened to challenges on the bench, women headed to school cafeterias, playgrounds and PTA meetings, doing the bulk of the behind-the-scenes work of supporting the politics of segregation.\n\nWhite women organized precinct gatherings to pressure their politicians to uphold Jim Crow laws. They transformed their homes into centers of bureaucratic efficiency \u2014 copying fliers, assigning neighborhoods for petition drives and scheduling protest shifts at elementary schools and bus garages.\n\nIt was also women who shaped the way segregation, white supremacy and ideas about racial identity were knitted into the fabric of their communities. Working as midwives, teachers and social workers, women policed the racial identity of babies, students and clients to ensure that the dividing line between white and black remained intact. And across the nation, women-led groups like Patriotic American Youth and the Women for Constitutional Government and Pro America spread the message to the next generation that opposition to racial equality was about states\u2019 rights and limited government, not white supremacy.\n\nIf narratives about white supremacy have been shaped by the overwhelmingly masculine lens through which we examine practically all political movements, there are also aspects of white supremacy that make it different. One critical factor here is the central role ascribed to white male sexual and status anxiety and lust for dominance in fomenting organized white-supremacist activities. As part of arguments against desegregation, many who belonged to these movements embraced a narrative that saw white women and girls as vulnerable (to black men), and white men as protectors \u2014 a story line that simultaneously elevated white men and rendered women helpmates and beneficiaries, not activists.\n\nBut this broader narrative obscures and even gives cover to the ways white women sometimes used white supremacy for their own gain. The suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt in the early 20th century argued for women\u2019s voting rights in Southern states on the basis that \u201cwhite supremacy will be strengthened, not weakened, by white women\u2019s suffrage.\u201d In the 1920s, the journalist Nell Battle Lewis of North Carolina never questioned the absolute need for racial segregation even as she criticized the violence committed in the name of Jim Crow. Staying in the racial fold, she was afforded the opportunity to blast her state\u2019s regressive labor and gender politics. Being a white supremacist, even a liberal one, meant that she remained part of the conversation.\n\nThe point, here, is neither to catalog nor to celebrate white women\u2019s contributions to white supremacist politics. Instead, their work should change how we understand history. It is easy to denounce the racist pronouncements and white-supremacist politics of a George Wallace or a Roy Moore. But what white women teach us is that white-supremacist politics is sustained at a much more grass-roots level by our neighbors, school boards and even friends. White women have made white supremacy a much more formidable and long-lasting force in American society, sustaining it at both the local and national levels.\n\nToday, it seems, the story America prefers to tell itself about white supremacy has changed little since the middle of the century: Instead of Klan lynchings, we focus on the rally in Charlottesville; instead of George Wallace, we focus on Jeff Sessions or, for that matter, Donald Trump. Outrage over the violence and rhetoric of these men buries an equally important and certainly more intransigent story of longstanding grass-roots and national campaigns populated partly by white women who aim to maintain racial and economic inequities on the American landscape. If we begin to consider their staying power with seriousness rather than surprise \u2014 a surprise not shared by black women \u2014 perhaps we can more effectively prepare to counter this strand of American politics.", "keywords": ["womens", "power", "white", "work", "women", "racial", "american", "supremacy", "politics", "men", "whitesupremacist"], "polarity": 0.08455011423761423, "subjectivity": 0.23956078643578646},

But a new analysis from the Center for New York City Affairs at the New School takes a closer look by mapping the achievement gaps within each public elementary school in New York City. The results reveal the challenges of integrating students across the system, and of integrating under one roof.\n\nThe study is a snapshot that looks at student performance on a single test, the state math assessment given in 2016 to third through fifth graders. At each school, it looks at the race of the test takers and estimates their household income using census information about where they live.\n\nThe report illustrates how closely race, income and academic performance are tied in this city. Almost all students in the study with estimated household incomes below $30,000 were black or Hispanic, while students with household incomes above $80,000 were predominantly white. And the poorer students were, the lower they tended to score on the test, even when they went to the same school as wealthier children.\n\nTake P.S. 8, the Robert Fulton school in Brooklyn Heights, which the Center for American Progress identified last year as having one of the richest Parent Teacher Associations in the country, and which has a relatively diverse student body. While 64 percent of its students passed the state math test in 2016, compared with 36 percent of students citywide, black students at the school were nearly a full proficiency level behind their white peers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBlack students at the school also had significantly lower estimated incomes than white students.\n\nNicole Mader, the co-author of the study, said the lingering achievement gap demonstrates that just having different kinds of students together in the same building is not enough to have true integration. Students must be in the same classrooms, have the same quality of teachers and be disciplined in the same way.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orban, and the right-wing government he leads, have been on the offensive since then over the European Union\u2019s migration policies, which require member states to resettle a quota of refugees. Last week, at a meeting in Budapest of the Visegrad Group, an alliance of central European nations, Mr. Orban said, \u201cWe do not wish to become a destination country for migrants.\u201d\n\nThe media here has offered widespread support to Mr. Okovacs for bringing back a popular production after decades. Origo, a government-friendly news website, published an article with the headline \u201cOnly blacks used to be able to perform this opera because of racist restrictions.\u201d And the online theater magazine szinhaz.hu welcomed what it referred to as the Hungarian State Opera\u2019s \u201cbreaking the ice\u201d by staging the opera with \u201cits excellent Hungarian singers.\u201d\n\nMany conservative columnists, including in the daily Magyar Nemzet, have denounced the \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d of performing the opera only with a black cast. \u201cPolitical correctness is slowly devouring aesthetics,\u201d one columnist said.\n\nThe director of the production, Andras Almasi-Toth, told szinhaz.huthat \u201cwhile performance and staging solutions have progressed \u2014 we play, sing and stage Puccini differently from 50 years ago \u2014 this opera was left out, which makes for a very sterile production. It can only take place on Catfish Row in the 1930s, which gives it a fairy-tale like quality, devoid of its real-life aspects.\u201d\n\nIn a telephone interview, Dr. Ronald Crutcher, an African-American music scholar and president of the University of Richmond, said that he thought the idea of transplanting \u201cPorgy and Bess\u201d to somewhere other than Catfish Row was \u201cfascinating\u201d but added that \u201cthe whole notion of recasting the story as an immigrant struggle is hard to imagine. It\u2019s an iconic piece that was written at a critically important time, particularly in America,\u201d he continued.\n\nBut awareness of this is limited here in Hungary. Adam Kertesz, 69, an academic who was in the audience for Saturday\u2019s premiere, said he was unfamiliar with the opera\u2019s historical context. \u201cI didn\u2019t know about all that,\u201d Mr. Kertesz said. \u201cI just love the music. I saw the 1983 production of \u2018Porgy\u2019 here.
