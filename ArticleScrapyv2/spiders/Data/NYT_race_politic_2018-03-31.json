Last year, he pardoned three veterans who had been deported to Mexico and in 2015, he pardoned a man who was fighting deportation after serving two decades for burglary and kidnapping, among other crimes.\n\nFor ex-convict immigrants, deportation is a severe punishment that is often unwarranted, said Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, which seeks to change California\u2019s laws to help immigrants avoid deportation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe believe that deportation is an enhancement to their sentences that goes way too far,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve actually paid their debt to society.\u201d\n\nImmigration law is \u201cso punitive, that it just does not forgive,\u201d she added. \u201cMost judges, their hands are tied behind their back,\u201d she said, and the inability to have any discretion promotes large-scale deportation.\n\nMr. Trump visited California in mid-March to inspect border wall prototypes designed to keep out undocumented immigrants. The trip came one week after Attorney General Jeff Sessions sued the state over three new immigration laws he called unconstitutional, saying they made it impossible for federal immigration officials to deport criminals who were born outside the United States.\n\nMr. Brown, a Democrat, said at the time that Mr. Sessions was \u201cbasically going to war\u201d with California.\n\nIn Mr. Trump\u2019s weekly address on Saturday he took another swipe at California, blaming so-called sanctuary cities for the opioid epidemic, and referring to California as a \u201csanctuary state\u201d that has become a hub for transporting heroin across the southern border. He also admonished Oakland\u2019s mayor for helping \u201ccriminal aliens\u201d elude the authorities because of the city\u2019s \u201cdangerous sanctuary policies.\u201d\n\n\u201cSanctuary cities put innocent Americans at the mercy of hardened criminals and heartless drug dealers,\u201d Mr. Trump added. \u201cThese are bad people.\u201d\n\nThat argument \u2014 that immigrants bring crime to America \u2014 has influenced many of the Trump administration\u2019s policies on immigration. Studies have shown, however, that immigration does not drive crime. According to one recent analysis, a large-scale collaboration by four universities, the areas with the largest increases in immigrants all had lower levels of crime in 2016 than in 1980.\n\n\u201cThe data is crystal clear that immigrants do not lead to an increase in crime,\u201d said Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum. \u201cI think opponents to immigration like to cherry-pick egregious cases where the individual does not belong in the U.S. and therefore marginalize an entire community.\u201d", "keywords": ["crime", "state", "immigrants", "provoking", "sanctuary", "pardoned", "deportation", "pardons", "brown", "immigration", "exconvicts", "trump", "jerry", "mr", "facing"], "polarity": 0.030273994298384548, "subjectivity": 0.4020747545137789},

College-educated suburbanites outside Philadelphia are angry at Mr. Trump and in a mood to send him a message. And blue-collar voters in western Pennsylvania are suddenly up for grabs, after they turned out strongly in the special election this month to elect a moderate young Democrat, Conor Lamb, over a Republican who ran as a wingman to the president.\n\nIn the Philadelphia suburbs, three Republican incumbents who have seen the writing on the wall are retiring, and a fourth is stepping down after a sexual harassment scandal. The latest to retire is Representative Ryan Costello, who announced his decision over the weekend, citing the difficulty of being heard over the cacophony from the White House.\n\nThe shifts outside Philadelphia mirror changes in suburbs around the country, as Mr. Trump\u2019s policies and behavior have pushed away college-educated voters. The Pew Research Center reported this week that more voters with a four-year college degree now identify as Democrats or lean Democratic \u2014 54 percent \u2014 than at any time since 1994.\n\nPhiladelphia\u2019s suburbs were once so reliably Republican that Ronald Reagan\u2019s cabinet included three residents of Montgomery County alone. But the region\u2019s allegiance began to shift as well-educated and culturally liberal voters came to predominate in the suburbs in the 1990s.\n\nThe tide was held back in the last decade by gerrymandered congressional districts drawn by Republicans to protect their candidates. But that map was thrown out by the state court in January, and Republicans lost appeals to have the United States Supreme Court intervene. The state's new districts hew more compactly to county and town boundaries.\n\nTwo nonpartisan handicappers of House races, the Cook Political Report and Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball, now rate four Republican-held seats in the Philadelphia suburbs as either \u201csolidly\u201d Democratic, \u201clikely\u201d to fall into the party\u2019s hands, or \u201cleaning\u201d that way.

Mr. Fitzpatrick has a record of attracting crossover votes from Democrats and enjoys the advantages of incumbency but is in his first term. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to get incumbents, you typically knock them off in their first term,\u201d Mr. Gerow said.\n\nAt the other end of the state, Mr. Lamb, a former Marine and prosecutor, is running his second race of the year, this time in a new district against an incumbent, Representative Keith Rothfus, a Republican who was once paired by a political blog in a celebrity look-alike feature with the cartoon character Milhouse.\n\nThe new district, the 17th, is more evenly balanced in its partisan leanings than the former 18th District, where Mr. Lamb won his upset victory in part by reawakening dormant Democratic DNA in white working-class voters who had supported Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Rothfus, by contrast, is \u201cseveral clicks to the right\u201d of his new district, according to one Republican official who spoke on condition of anonymity to candidly assess the race.\n\nAnother Republican who was shifted to a more competitive district is Representative Scott Perry, who represents Harrisburg and York in central Pennsylvania. Mr. Perry is the only member of the far-right Freedom Caucus in the state\u2019s Congressional delegation. Mr. Trump won his old district by 21 percentage points; the new map places him in territory the president carried by only nine.\n\nFive Democrats are seeking their party\u2019s nomination to run against Mr. Perry.

At the same time, Mr. Kim\u2019s visit helped China reassert its role in diplomacy around denuclearizing North Korea, a process that has been dominated by South Korea and the United States in recent months. If China\u2019s role on the Korean Peninsula grows bigger, it strengthens North Korea\u2019s leverage in talks and helps China as well if a trade war with the United States comes to pass, said Professor Shim.\n\nMr. Kim\u2019s meeting with Mr. Xi has already complicated Mr. Trump\u2019s calculations.\n\nChina\u2019s state news media reported that Mr. Kim had called for \u201cphased, synchronized\u201d moves toward denuclearizing his country \u2014 the same approach the North insisted on in past negotiations with Washington. In those talks, the North said it would take only incremental steps toward giving up its nuclear program, beginning with a freeze, and demanded that the United States offer simultaneous incentives.

He will now be under substantial pressure from disgruntled senators to make that happen.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people upset, and understandably so,\u201d said Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, who said Republicans needed to do whatever necessary to force debate on the spending bills, even if it meant extended sessions that left lawmakers exhausted. \u201cWe have allowed the power to accumulate and be vested in just a few people.\u201d\n\nRestless lawmakers demanding more opinion may get some help from a change in the committee\u2019s leadership with the departure of Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi, the ailing chairman.\n\nSenator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and the incoming chairman, has been assuring colleagues that he wants to return to the old ways of bringing individual bills to the floor \u2014 though floor time is ultimately apportioned by Mr. McConnell.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith overall spending levels already set for the coming year in a two-year budget compromise, the Appropriations Committees can get an early start on drafting their bills, potentially providing the House and Senate more debate time.

{"title": "\n                    Silicon Valley Warms to Trump After a Chilly Start                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/30/technology/silicon-valley-trump.html", "text": "Yet quietly, the tech industry has warmed to the White House, especially as companies including Alphabet, Apple and Intel have benefited from the Trump administration\u2019s policies.\n\nThose include lowering corporate taxes, encouraging development of new wireless technology like 5G and, so far, ignoring calls to break up the tech giants. Mr. Trump\u2019s tougher stance on China may also help ward off industry rivals, with the president squashing a hostile bid to acquire the chip maker Qualcomm this month. And Mr. Trump let die an Obama-era rule that required many tech start-ups to give some workers more overtime pay.\n\nMr. Trump \u201chas been great for business and really, really good for tech,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, who leads the Consumer Technology Association, the largest American tech trade group, with more than 2,200 members including Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook.\n\nMr. Shapiro said that he had voted for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump\u2019s opponent, in 2016, but that he and many tech executives had come around on Mr. Trump. While they disagree with him on immigration and the environment, they have found areas where their interests align, like deregulation and investment in internet infrastructure.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t Hitler or Mussolini here,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. And even though the president\u2019s new tariffs on steel and aluminum could hurt American businesses and consumers, \u201cdisagreement in one area does not mean we cannot work together in others,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cEveryone who is married knows that.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump himself has taken to naming tech companies he says are on his side.\n\nAfter Apple took advantage of the new tax law in January to bring back most of the $252 billion cash hoard that it had parked overseas, the company said it would make a $350 billion \u201ccontribution to the U.S. economy\u201d over the next five years. That prompted Mr. Trump to suggest he had made good on a campaign pledge to get Apple to bring jobs back to the United States.\n\n\u201cYou know, for $350 million, you could build a beautiful plant. But for $350 billion, they\u2019re going to build a lot of plants,\u201d the president told members of Congress last month. Mr. Trump said he had called Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, to personally thank him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn fact, Apple has no plans to build a plant in the United States. The company is uneasy with Mr. Trump\u2019s invoking it to signify how his policies are working, according to a person close to Apple who was not authorized to speak publicly. Apple has not, however, publicly corrected the president.\n\nMr. Trump has also stayed quiet on the controversy engulfing Facebook over user privacy, while other politicians have called for more regulations after revelations that the British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested the information of 50 million Facebook users. Cambridge Analytica used that data to aid Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nMichael Kratsios, the White House\u2019s deputy chief technology officer, said in an interview that while Mr. Trump and Silicon Valley had their differences, \u201cin places where we do see eye to eye, I think we\u2019re achieving extraordinary success.\u201d\n\nDean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, a 102-year-old advocacy group that represents the biggest tech firms, said his members walked a tightrope, supporting and opposing the president on different issues. Lately, he said, \u201cwe have reached balance in the tightrope.\u201d\n\nThe equilibrium marks a turnabout from what had been a testy relationship between Mr. Trump and the tech sector. On the campaign trail in 2016, Mr. Trump was so critical of tech companies that Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, once joked he might send Mr. Trump to space in a rocket.\n\nSome tech executives have since disagreed with Mr. Trump on social issues. Mr. Cook emailed staff last June to say he had unsuccessfully lobbied the president to remain in the Paris climate accords. In November, Microsoft sued the administration to protect a law that blocks deportation of young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers. More than 100 companies, including Google, Facebook and Uber, filed a brief supporting California\u2019s lawsuit on that issue.\n\nEven so, tech executives worked to build a relationship with the president, with some meeting him at Trump Tower before his inauguration and again at the White House in June. While in Washington for the second meeting, Mr. Cook and Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, also dined with Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s senior adviser and son-in-law, and Ivanka Trump at the couple\u2019s Washington home, according to a person briefed on the meeting who wasn\u2019t authorized to speak publicly about it. This month, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin visited Apple\u2019s headquarters.\n\nSilicon Valley has found plenty to like about the Trump presidency. In September, tech giants including Facebook and Microsoft teamed up with the administration to pledge $500 million to computer science education. Amazon, Microsoft and Google are also eyeing the administration as a potential customer as Mr. Trump pushes to modernize the government\u2019s digital infrastructure.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut Silicon Valley\u2019s favorite thing about Mr. Trump is almost certainly his new tax code. Many tech companies lobbied for corporate tax reform for years before Mr. Trump signed the new tax bill.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTech giants immediately reaped the benefits. Under the new rules, Apple saved $43.7 billion in taxes, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan research group. Apple then announced the $350 billion \u201ccontribution\u201d to the economy over five years.\n\nMost of the tally was previously planned spending with American suppliers and a $38 billion tax payment on its overseas cash. But Apple also said it planned to hire 20,000 new workers, invest in new data centers and another domestic campus, and increase a fund for innovative American manufacturers to $5 billion from $1 billion. It also gave employees $2,500 bonuses.\n\nThe president was quick to tweet the news.\n\nThe shifting relationship between Silicon Valley and Mr. Trump appears to have upset some tech employees. A Facebook page called \u201cAngry Googler,\u201d with nearly 1,000 followers, has been dedicated to criticizing Google for any sign it was cooperating with the president.\n\n\u201cNot happy about Google pulling a 180 and jumping into bed with Trump? Same here,\u201d said the \u201cAbout\u201d section of the page, which suggests it is run by a Google employee. This month, the page posted an article about Google helping the Defense Department analyze drone footage. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from organizing the world\u2019s information to \u2026 optimizing weapons of war,\u201d the page said.\n\nMessages to the account were not returned. Google declined to comment.\n\nSome tech firms remain discomfited about appearing as the president\u2019s allies. Last month, Rob Goldman, Facebook\u2019s vice president of advertising, played down Russia\u2019s impact on the 2016 election after the Justice Department charged 13 Russians with trying to subvert its outcome, including by using Facebook. Mr. Trump retweeted Mr. Goldman approvingly.\n\nFacebook was uncomfortable with that association with the president, said a person close to the company who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nTwo days later, Facebook\u2019s policy chief, Joel Kaplan, distanced the company from Mr. Goldman\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cThe special counsel has issued its indictments, and nothing we found contradicts their conclusions,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAny suggestion otherwise is wrong.\u201d", "keywords": ["start", "facebook", "tax", "apple", "tech", "month", "billion", "valley", "president", "silicon", "trump", "warms", "mr", "chilly", "google"], "polarity": 0.12322803382254603, "subjectivity": 0.37953995530215034},

He was considering expanding his media and events businesses into Saudi Arabia and also was hunting for moneyed partners in acquisitions.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe intersection of the tabloid publisher with the Saudis, enhanced by the White House visit, is a previously untold chapter in the long, symbiotic relationship between the president and Mr. Pecker, which was forged in the 1990s. At the time, Mr. Trump was celebrating a real estate comeback after his casino bankruptcies and was both the subject and the source of much gossip in New York.\n\nMr. Pecker, who had known Mr. Grine only for a few months, invited him to the dinner to thank him for advice he had provided about investing in the Middle East, according to someone who knew of the invitation.\n\nWord soon traveled back to Saudi Arabia about the dinner: It signaled Mr. Pecker\u2019s powerful status in Washington.\n\nTwo months later, he was in Saudi Arabia, meeting with Mr. Grine and the crown prince about business opportunities there, according to A.M.I.\n\nAnd by January, Mr. Pecker was confident enough about his growing rapport with Saudi investors that he sought their help bankrolling a possible acquisition of Time magazine, which he had long coveted, according to two people with direct knowledge of the talks. A.M.I. disputed that.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe people briefed on the interactions between A.M.I. and Saudi Arabia requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe outcome of Mr. Pecker\u2019s efforts to do business with the Saudis remains unclear. But he is still working to cultivate ties. This week, he and Mr. Grine both attended events in New York featuring Prince Mohammed, who is on a tour across the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAhead of that visit, A.M.I. published a 97-page glossy magazine that is essentially a promotional brochure for Saudi Arabia and the crown prince. It makes no mention of anything troubling, like the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen, human rights concerns or the crown prince\u2019s arrest last fall of many extended royals, including Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, an influential client of Mr. Grine\u2019s.\n\nThe magazine \u2014 which refers to Saudi Arabia throughout as \u201cthe Magic Kingdom\u201d \u2014 includes an interview with Mr. Grine, accompanied by a photo of him posing with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, taken during his visit with Mr. Pecker. It talks up the relationship between Mr. Trump and the Saudis, noting that Mr. Trump \u201cendorsed the crown prince\u2019s high profile anticorruption\u201d crackdown.\n\nA.M.I. has said it produced the magazine to \u201ccapitalize\u201d on interest in the crown prince, who is next in line to the throne, and has been careful to say it received no input or guidance from Saudi officials. That carries important legal implications: Foreign direction or control of such a purely promotional publication may require disclosure to the Justice Department. The Saudi government did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe magazine \u2014 200,000 copies distributed in Walmart and other outlets, with a cover price of $13.99 and no advertising \u2014 provided a unique welcome mat for the prince, whose visit comes as the Trump administration is trying to establish tighter ties with the kingdom. Both countries are touting cross-border investment opportunities, including a pledge by the Saudi government to put $20 billion into a fund that will invest in American infrastructure projects. The kingdom is also nearing a deal to buy American-made missiles and other military equipment.\n\nMr. Grine, a 30-year-old French citizen, has helped broker deals between Saudi investors and companies in France, Senegal and the United States. He and Mr. Pecker were introduced last spring by Ari Emanuel, chief executive of Endeavor, the huge talent, entertainment and sports company based in Beverly Hills, Calif.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Grine and Mr. Pecker soon had a series of discussions about the investment landscape in Saudi Arabia, according to a person briefed on the talks.

Instead, he has proposed the death penalty for drug dealers, entered into haphazard diplomacy talks with North Korea, and gone back and forth on his views on tariffs. And on Thursday, in an appearance in Ohio that was supposed to be about infrastructure, he seemed to stall a trade deal that had already been negotiated with South Korea.\n\nThere is a palpable worry among those in the West Wing about who the president will now confide in \u2014 and how many other people might be able to occasionally pull him back \u2014 now that Ms. Hicks is gone.\n\nShe is also among the people the staff relied on to bolster flagging morale \u2014 one White House official described her departure as a mother leaving her children behind. To cut the tension in a chaotic workplace, Ms. Hicks baked cookies for aides on Valentine\u2019s Day, swapped country music song recommendations and texted her colleagues funny video clips.\n\nAnother person who has had conversations with both the president and Ms. Hicks in recent weeks, speaking on the condition of anonymity so as not to divulge private conversations, said that Mr. Trump relied on her and trusted her implicitly, mainly because she had never shown a willingness to put her own agenda ahead of his. She had also gained the trust of others in the Trump family for her loyalty.\n\n\u201cHope is exceptional in every way and is loved by all who know her,\u201d Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and senior adviser, said in a statement. \u201cShe is brilliant, dedicated and compassionate \u2014 a unique talent.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s chief of staff, John F. Kelly, has told several people he might leave the communications director role open for a time. But Tony Sayegh, a spokesman for the Treasury Department, is said to be up for consideration for the job, along with Mercedes Schlapp, the director of strategic communications. Another possible choice is Kellyanne Conway, who, crucially, is one of few senior aides able to communicate on Mr. Trump\u2019s wavelength, as Ms. Hicks could.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor now, at least, the small office next to the Oval Office, a space reserved for a Trump confidante, will be filled by Dan Scavino, the director of social media and the only remaining Trump campaign original still in the White House. Before Ms. Hicks, that space was used by Keith Schiller, the president\u2019s longtime bodyguard, when he worked in the West Wing.\n\nMs. Hicks, true to form, declined multiple requests to comment for this article. She has been coy with people who ask about where she will work next, or her plans for a vacation after a nonstop grind over three years, though she has told friends she is ready for a break. Regardless, she is likely to remain among those in the Trump alumni orbit, populated by other former White House and campaign aides the president tends to phone.\n\nOn her last day, Ms. Hicks had already sent 50 handwritten notes to senior staff and other people. In one of her last public appearances as an aide to the president, Ms. Hicks stood next to Mr. Trump as he emerged from the Oval Office and stood in front of news cameras for the first time in nearly a week.\n\nHe gave Ms. Hicks a kiss on the cheek, then set across the lawn, where Marine One was waiting.

That\u2019s been something we\u2019ve been really looking at with eyes open since that time.\u201d\n\nAs the Nielsen numbers for \u201cRoseanne\u201d rolled in, ABC executives went from gobsmacked \u2014 Mr. Sherwood said he thought the early figures he had seen were a mistake \u2014 to euphoric.\n\n\u201cPeople gather round and they see themselves in this family,\u201d Mr. Sherwood said. \u201cIt speaks to a large number of people in the country who don\u2019t see themselves on television very often.\u201d\n\nBy Thursday, this dusted-off sitcom centered on a highly opinionated matriarch had become a flash point in the nation\u2019s culture wars. It had also spurred a cathartic response from many conservatives, who counted its opening-night success as their own.\n\nAmong those celebrating was President Trump, who called Ms. Barr to congratulate her on the \u201chuge\u201d ratings. On Thursday, he gave a shout-out to the Emmy-winning star during a rally in Ohio.\n\n\u201cLook at Roseanne! Look at her ratings!\u201d President Trump told the crowd of union workers, adding: \u201cThey were unbelievable! Over 18 million people! And it was about us!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRight-wing pundits praised the show as a mic-drop moment for conservatives weary of being portrayed unflatteringly or ignored altogether on network shows. On Fox News, Sean Hannity congratulated her on her \u201cmassive audience,\u201d and Laura Ingraham approvingly played a \u201cRoseanne\u201d clip, saying, \u201cFunny what can happen when Hollywood makes programming that\u2019s not condescending toward half the country.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, via Twitter, Mr. Hannity invited Ms. Barr to guest-host his show. \u201cDM me,\u201d Ms. Barr replied.\n\nMs. Barr, 65, supported Mr. Trump in 2016, but she makes for an unlikely conservative standard-bearer: Aside from her support of same-sex marriage and abortion rights, she was once denounced by the elder President George Bush as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d after delivering a lewd, off-key rendition of the national anthem at a 1990 baseball game.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The onscreen Roseanne makes for a sharp foil to Ms. Metcalf\u2019s character, who wears a \u201cnasty woman\u201d T-shirt and accuses Trump supporters of \u201cwrapping yourselves up in the flag and clinging to your guns.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe show doesn\u2019t advocate for Trump voters, but it respects them,\u201d said Alex Castellanos, a veteran Republican strategist based in Florida. \u201cApparently, this is still news to people in the entertainment business, that there is an American working class.\u201d\n\nFor years, ABC focused on other demographic groups. With series like \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d \u201cblack-ish,\u201d \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cModern Family,\u201d the network\u2019s lineup was notably diverse. But it was also geared toward upper-middle-class viewers, Ms. Dungey said.\n\nBy November 2016, ABC was coming off a TV season when it had finished in last place among the four major broadcast networks, with little hope of escaping the ratings basement in the near future. Like other networks, it was also losing viewers to Netflix and other streaming platforms.\n\nThe meeting that took place on the morning after Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise victory led the network to reconsider its strategy. Mr. Sherwood summed up what was going through his mind that day: \u201cGiven the declines of broadcast television, the year-after-year declines, are we programming in a way that is turning people off?\u201d\n\nIn response, ABC decided to back the singing competition show \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d less than two years after it had been canceled on Fox, its original network home.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe went after it because that\u2019s a show that, fundamentally, is about the American dream,\u201d Mr. Sherwood said. \u201cIt\u2019s about a girl with a cowboy hat and a boy with a banjo and people from small towns where music has saved their lives in different ways.\u201d\n\n\u201cRoseanne,\u201d which had its first run on ABC from 1988 to 1997, was another prime candidate for a reboot. It was a top-rated comedy that had won its share of Emmys and Golden Globes \u2014 not to mention that the woman who played its title character had become a vocal Trump supporter.\n\nEven as the president portrayed the success of \u201cRoseanne\u201d as a win of his own, however, ABC executives and \u201cRoseanne\u201d producers rejected the notion that the show\u2019s popularity was mainly because of its appeal to Trump supporters.\n\n\u201cI would compare this to \u2018All in the Family,\u2019\u201d said Tom Werner, an executive producer of \u201cRoseanne\u201d and other hit sitcoms like \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d and \u201c3rd Rock From the Sun.\u201d \u201cA number of people watching \u2018All in the Family\u2019 said, \u2018Archie\u2019s a conservative and therefore it\u2019s a show about a conservative.\u2019 Well, it was made by Norman Lear.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason the show is successful is because it taps into the frustration and disappointment that working-class people feel about the economy right now,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut if you watch all the episodes, we don\u2019t really mention politics as much as we did in the pilot.\u201d\n\nMr. Werner pointed out that \u201cRoseanne\u201d will deal with the opioid epidemic and immigration in its seven remaining episodes, adding that the president does not come up much as the show goes on.\n\nAs a topical, working-class sitcom led by a Trump supporter, \u201cRoseanne\u201d is unique \u2014 for now. Its early ratings success is likely to spur copycats in Hollywood, which is not known for its high percentage of conservatives.\n\n\u201cMoney is the ideology of Hollywood,\u201d said Martin Kaplan, director of the Norman Lear Center for media and society at the University of Southern California. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine an executive who would turn down something for ideological reasons that they think has a chance to do a good number.\u201d", "keywords": ["heartland", "abcs", "trumps", "success", "president", "strategy", "mr", "ms", "abc", "ratings", "trump", "network", "roseanne", "victory", "sprang", "sherwood", "reboot"], "polarity": 0.0908357428632278, "subjectivity": 0.3910284427754307},

About 30 percent of veterans\u2019 appointments are currently made with private health providers for those reasons.\n\nBut the groups prefer tweaking programs already in place while at the same time addressing the problems that made private care necessary.\n\nJohn Hoellwarth, the communications director for Amvets, said he thought the first response of most veterans groups to Dr. Jackson was to search for him online.\n\nDr. Shulkin said that he had been friendly with Dr. Jackson for several years \u2014 both men also served in the Obama administration \u2014 and encouraged him to go through the interview process to lead the department\u2019s health system this year. Still, he said that he thought concerns about Dr. Jackson\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 were justified.\n\n\u201cThere is no question about it, but I can\u2019t imagine any job that prepares you for this type of job,\u201d Dr. Shulkin said.\n\nBy most accounts, Dr. Shulkin\u2019s rapid fall began as he increasingly butted heads with other Trump administration official over how to approach the expansion of private care. The officials \u2014 who included the department\u2019s press secretary and assistant secretary for communications \u2014 came to consider Dr. Shulkin as an obstacle and repeatedly tried to have him removed.\n\nMany of those officials, several of whom have ties to the Concerned Veterans group, are still in the administration and are likely to have increased sway in the department. But the ultimate decision about the structure of the department\u2019s health care most likely resides on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers have been struggling for almost a year with the issue.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI think that there was a miscalculation that if you could get rid of the secretary who is a moderate that things will fall in place, and I just don\u2019t think that is going to happen,\u201d Dr. Shulkin said.\n\nPhoto\n\nDan Caldwell, the executive director of Concerned Veterans for America, strenuously disputed Dr. Shulkin\u2019s analysis and said the secretary was using privatization as a \u201cstraw man\u201d to distract from his own ethical lapses.\n\n\u201cThe president has said he supports full V.A. choice,\u201d Mr. Caldwell said. \u201cThe president would not have selected Admiral Jackson if he did not believe he supports his full agenda.\u201d\n\nMr. Caldwell was referring to a damning report released in February by the department\u2019s inspector general that found \u201cserious derelictions\u201d related to a trip Dr. Shulkin took last year to Britain and Denmark. It concluded that he had spent much of the trip, which cost more than $122,000, sightseeing and that he had improperly accepted Wimbledon tickets as a gift.\n\nDr. Shulkin has continued to deny any wrongdoing, and on Thursday blamed his political opponents in the department for the investigation itself.\n\n\u201cThis is 100 percent about the politics and this is the way that people fight their battles in Washington rather than having intellectually honest discussions,\u201d he said.\n\nThe White House did not view it that way.

Mr. Trump seemed intently focused on delivering his own progress report to supporters on a range of red-meat issues, including his zeal for improving border security, his promise to construct a border wall with Mexico, his administration\u2019s efforts to roll back what he called \u201cjob killing\u201d regulations and his thwarting of Democrats.\n\n\u201cReally, I have gotten done much more than I promised,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe did a lot of things I didn\u2019t even promise.\u201d\n\nIn the driving rain, Mr. Trump made his way to the training center, where he had been scheduled to sell an ambitious plan that would try to leverage $200 billion in federal spending to generate $1.5 trillion in total spending on projects such as tunnels, bridges and highways. White House officials had framed the event as a ramp-up, but this conflicted with the president\u2019s decision to say he would push the plan to next year, declaring that he did not expect it to pass at least until after the November midterm elections.\n\nAlso curiously, Mr. Trump spent little time on the trade deal struck with South Korea this week, which had been a win for his administration. That continued a relatively muted celebration: The announcement of that agreement\u2019s details came not from Mr. Trump or his White House, but from South Korean officials; Trump administration officials unveiled the plan days later in a conference call with reporters.\n\nInstead, Mr. Trump disparaged a previous version of a South Korea trade agreement as a \u201chorror show\u201d and a \u201cHillary Clinton special.\u201d He mused to the crowd that he might hold up finalizing the deal while he pursues planned talks with North Korea.\n\n\u201cCertainly, the rhetoric has calmed down just a little bit, would you say?\u201d Mr. Trump asked the crowd. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how it all turns out.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump seemed to veer off script in other areas as well.

As recently as Tuesday, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said that while American forces were no longer in \u201can offensive effort on the ground\u201d and had \u201cdrawn off slightly\u201d to avoid accidental conflict with Russian troops, they continued to play a role. \u201cWe continue the operations in Syria,\u201d he said.\n\nSome foreign policy specialists said a complete withdrawal of American troops from Syria would leave a dangerous void. \u201cIf we\u2019re pulling those troops out, we\u2019re ceding the remnants of Syria to the Russians and the Iranians and the other actors, which actually I would argue would be a big victory for Russia,\u201d said Jamie M. Fly, a Republican scholar at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n\nMr. Trump eventually focused on infrastructure on Thursday, zeroing in on his plan to speed up permitting. But the subject and timing of the president\u2019s focus on his plan, announced in February, are curious. Congressional Republicans have not shown much appetite for taking up the infrastructure package, and neither have Democrats, who prefer proposals with much more federal spending.\n\nMr. Trump acknowledged some of that reality in his remarks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get Democrat support very much,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re probably going to have to wait until after the election.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials have not mounted any sort of effort, in public or private, that matches the scale of the pressure campaign they employed before the passage of Mr. Trump\u2019s signature tax cut package last year. Perhaps the most prominent advocate of the infrastructure proposal, Gary D. Cohn, recently left his post as director of the National Economic Council. His successor, Larry Kudlow, is less enthusiastic about increases in federal infrastructure spending.\n\nThe administration envisions states, local governments and the private sector contributing the bulk of the funds, a recipe that experts doubt would result in anywhere close to the targeted level of investment.\n\nRichard Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which has lobbied for a large infrastructure bill, said he was skeptical that the president\u2019s visit would spur any action.\n\n\u201cHe and Congress didn\u2019t blink whenever they shelled out a trillion and a half dollars in tax giveaways for the rich,\u201d Mr. Trumka said, \u201cbut we haven\u2019t seen a nickel yet for infrastructure. He can talk about it forever, but he\u2019s got to do something.\u201d\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, echoed that sentiment on Thursday. \u201cDemocrats are eager to work with the administration on infrastructure,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there\u2019s been a lack of seriousness on this issue from the White House.\u201d", "keywords": ["heralds", "south", "plan", "officials", "youre", "presidents", "troops", "korea", "delay", "administration", "deal", "trade", "syria", "trump", "mr", "infrastructure"], "polarity": 0.0694902003762763, "subjectivity": 0.3339288910807898},

Both nominations require Senate confirmation, and Ms. Haspel will certainly face questions about her work as a clandestine officer in the agency\u2019s counterterrorism operations.

Last year, he pardoned three veterans who had been deported to Mexico and in 2015, he pardoned a man who was fighting deportation after serving two decades for burglary and kidnapping, among other crimes.\n\nFor ex-convict immigrants, deportation is a severe punishment that is often unwarranted, said Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, which seeks to change California\u2019s laws to help immigrants avoid deportation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe believe that deportation is an enhancement to their sentences that goes way too far,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve actually paid their debt to society.\u201d\n\nImmigration law is \u201cso punitive, that it just does not forgive,\u201d she added. \u201cMost judges, their hands are tied behind their back,\u201d she said, and the inability to have any discretion promotes large-scale deportation.\n\nMr. Trump visited California in mid-March to inspect border wall prototypes designed to keep out undocumented immigrants. The trip came one week after Attorney General Jeff Sessions sued the state over three new immigration laws he called unconstitutional, saying they made it impossible for federal immigration officials to deport criminals who were born outside the United States.\n\nMr. Brown, a Democrat, said at the time that Mr. Sessions was \u201cbasically going to war\u201d with California.\n\nIn Mr. Trump\u2019s weekly address on Saturday he took another swipe at California, blaming so-called sanctuary cities for the opioid epidemic, and referring to California as a \u201csanctuary state\u201d that has become a hub for transporting heroin across the southern border.

College-educated suburbanites outside Philadelphia are angry at Mr. Trump and in a mood to send him a message. And blue-collar voters in western Pennsylvania are suddenly up for grabs, after they turned out strongly in the special election this month to elect a moderate young Democrat, Conor Lamb, over a Republican who ran as a wingman to the president.\n\nIn the Philadelphia suburbs, three Republican incumbents who have seen the writing on the wall are retiring, and a fourth is stepping down after a sexual harassment scandal. The latest to retire is Representative Ryan Costello, who announced his decision over the weekend, citing the difficulty of being heard over the cacophony from the White House.\n\nThe shifts outside Philadelphia mirror changes in suburbs around the country, as Mr. Trump\u2019s policies and behavior have pushed away college-educated voters. The Pew Research Center reported this week that more voters with a four-year college degree now identify as Democrats or lean Democratic \u2014 54 percent \u2014 than at any time since 1994.\n\nPhiladelphia\u2019s suburbs were once so reliably Republican that Ronald Reagan\u2019s cabinet included three residents of Montgomery County alone. But the region\u2019s allegiance began to shift as well-educated and culturally liberal voters came to predominate in the suburbs in the 1990s.\n\nThe tide was held back in the last decade by gerrymandered congressional districts drawn by Republicans to protect their candidates. But that map was thrown out by the state court in January, and Republicans lost appeals to have the United States Supreme Court intervene. The state's new districts hew more compactly to county and town boundaries.\n\nTwo nonpartisan handicappers of House races, the Cook Political Report and Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball, now rate four Republican-held seats in the Philadelphia suburbs as either \u201csolidly\u201d Democratic, \u201clikely\u201d to fall into the party\u2019s hands, or \u201cleaning\u201d that way.

Mr. Fitzpatrick has a record of attracting crossover votes from Democrats and enjoys the advantages of incumbency but is in his first term. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to get incumbents, you typically knock them off in their first term,\u201d Mr. Gerow said.\n\nAt the other end of the state, Mr. Lamb, a former Marine and prosecutor, is running his second race of the year, this time in a new district against an incumbent, Representative Keith Rothfus, a Republican who was once paired by a political blog in a celebrity look-alike feature with the cartoon character Milhouse.\n\nThe new district, the 17th, is more evenly balanced in its partisan leanings than the former 18th District, where Mr. Lamb won his upset victory in part by reawakening dormant Democratic DNA in white working-class voters who had supported Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Rothfus, by contrast, is \u201cseveral clicks to the right\u201d of his new district, according to one Republican official who spoke on condition of anonymity to candidly assess the race.\n\nAnother Republican who was shifted to a more competitive district is Representative Scott Perry, who represents Harrisburg and York in central Pennsylvania. Mr. Perry is the only member of the far-right Freedom Caucus in the state\u2019s Congressional delegation. Mr. Trump won his old district by 21 percentage points; the new map places him in territory the president carried by only nine.\n\nFive Democrats are seeking their party\u2019s nomination to run against Mr. Perry.

Mahoney, a pro-segregation Democrat. But his mood soon turned. He became obsessed with black \u201cagitators\u201d; he had state law enforcement spy on civil rights activists, and when King was killed he shut down Bowie State University, one of the state\u2019s historically black campuses, because he feared the students would riot.\n\nLike many conservatives in both parties, Agnew was convinced that the wave of rioting in the late 1960s wasn\u2019t the expression of black frustration over urban unemployment, discrimination and police brutality, but was the result of a conspiracy by black leaders. \u201cThe looting and rioting which has engulfed our city during the past several days did not occur by chance,\u201d he told his audience that day in Baltimore.\n\nPredictably, and justifiably, the state\u2019s civil rights leaders excoriated him. But they were drowned out by the thousands of Americans who voiced praise. According to Agnew\u2019s office, by the end of April 1968 he had received 7,588 letters and telegrams in support, against only 1,042 in opposition. The state\u2019s suburban newspapers uniformly praised him as well.\n\n\u201cHe was blunt but honest,\u201d wrote the editorial board of The Bethesda-Chevy Chase Tribune. \u201cGovernor Agnew is that type of man who is needed in the White House,\u201d one letter writer told The Washington Post.\n\nAgnew wasn\u2019t the only one taking a sudden hard line on the riots, or using them to build a case against civil rights liberalism in general. Nixon moved further to the right that spring and summer, abandoning his previous sympathy for urban blacks and adopting a fierce law-and-order stance. \u201cThe first civil right of every American is to be free from domestic violence,\u201d he said in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in Miami. On the same day he uttered those words, Nixon named Agnew as his running mate.\n\nTo political insiders and the media, Agnew was a disaster. He fumbled his speeches and once used a crude racial epithet to describe an Asian-American reporter. But as they did with Donald Trump a half-century later, pundits missed Agnew\u2019s fundamental appeal. He said it like it was, and if he dropped an occasional racial slur, well, so did many white Americans.\n\nNixon\u2019s campaign that fall was built on what would be called the Southern strategy, but as the historian Kevin Kruse has noted, it was really a suburban strategy. Nixon played to the middle by eschewing the overt racism of George Wallace. But he deployed a range of more subtle instruments \u2014 antibusing, anti-open housing \u2014 to appeal to the tens of millions of white suburbanites who imagined themselves to be racially innocent, yet quietly held many of the same prejudices about the \u201cinner city\u201d and \u201cblack radicals\u201d that their parents had held about King and other civil rights activists.", "keywords": ["urban", "nixon", "civil", "agnew", "black", "white", "lincoln", "wasnt", "backlash", "rights", "states", "opinion", "party", "racial"], "polarity": 0.005959868224019161, "subjectivity": 0.34280473195567535},

Mr. Trump has made much of that process public.\n\n\u201cTrump does not separate security from trade; they are all part of his pack of cards, while Moon tended to see them as separate issues,\u201d said Shim Sang-ryul, a professor of international trade at Kwangwoon University in Seoul.\n\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to link the trade deal with South Korea to a breakthrough in denuclearizing North Korea shows a growing unease in Washington, analysts said. Washington fears that Seoul might drift from their alliance and move closer to Beijing, while Mr. Trump feels his approach to North Korea is being undermined in the wake of a flurry of diplomatic initiatives by Mr. Kim in recent weeks, especially his meeting this week with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, analysts said. (On Thursday, North Korea released an English-language version of a documentary of the trip.)\n\nWhen Mr. Kim began seeking talks this year after ratcheting up regional tensions with a string of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missile tests, United States officials argued that he had done so because of pressure from Mr. Trump, including the threat of sanctions.\n\nBut analysts say that Mr. Kim had already been planning to seek talks at the end of a hurried effort to complete what he called \u201ca state nuclear force\u201d last year. Analysts say his goal was to enter negotiations with Washington with a much stronger hand than his father and predecessor, Kim Jong-il, had in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nPhoto\n\nAdding to that, Mr. Kim\u2019s decision to travel to Beijing to meet with Mr. Xi before his planned summit meetings with the South Korean and American presidents was a brilliant maneuver, analysts said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy choosing Beijing for his first trip abroad as leader, Mr. Kim recommitted North Korea to the traditional \u2014 yet much frayed \u2014 Communist alliance with China. At the same time, Mr. Kim\u2019s visit helped China reassert its role in diplomacy around denuclearizing North Korea, a process that has been dominated by South Korea and the United States in recent months. If China\u2019s role on the Korean Peninsula grows bigger, it strengthens North Korea\u2019s leverage in talks and helps China as well if a trade war with the United States comes to pass, said Professor Shim.\n\nMr. Kim\u2019s meeting with Mr. Xi has already complicated Mr. Trump\u2019s calculations.\n\nChina\u2019s state news media reported that Mr. Kim had called for \u201cphased, synchronized\u201d moves toward denuclearizing his country \u2014 the same approach the North insisted on in past negotiations with Washington. In those talks, the North said it would take only incremental steps toward giving up its nuclear program, beginning with a freeze, and demanded that the United States offer simultaneous incentives. Those past discussions all eventually collapsed as Washington and Pyongyang accused each other of reneging on agreements.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

{"title": "\n                    We Forgot What Dr. King Believed In                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/31/opinion/sunday/martin-luther-king-faith.html", "text": "Dr. King passionately believed that a commitment to God is a commitment to bettering humanity, that the spiritual practices of prayer and worship must be translated into concern for the poor and vulnerable. Dr. King would want us to live his specific faith: work to defeat racism, speak out in principled opposition to war and combat poverty with enlightened and compassionate public policy.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn his lifetime, he was disappointed in the complacency of both black and white churches. He would be as disappointed today. The white church largely remains a bastion of indifference to the plight of black people. White evangelicals continue to focus on personal piety as the measure of true Christianity, while neglecting the Social Gospel that enlivens Jesus\u2019 words for the masses. Dr. King saw faith as an urgent call to service, a selfless ethic of concern that, he said, quoting the Hebrew prophet Amos, made \u201cjustice roll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.\u201d\n\nToday, in the midst of resurgent bigotry and deep divisions in this country, faith is too often viewed as an oasis of retreat, a paradise of political disengagement. On this Easter Sunday, as we mark 50 years since Dr. King\u2019s death, it is a perfect and necessary time to remember his faith \u2014 and rekindle its urgency.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. King often declared his preacher\u2019s vocation by citing something like a biblical genealogy of black sacred rhetoric that traced through his family: \u201cI grew up in the church. My father is a preacher, my grandfather was a preacher, my great-grandfather was a preacher, my only brother is a preacher. My daddy\u2019s brother is a preacher. So I didn\u2019t have much choice.\u201d\n\nBut Dr. King\u2019s faith underwent significant change. At first, he was discouraged from the ministry by a strain of black preaching that was long on emotion and short on reason. Then, at Morehouse College, his encounter with preachers like the school\u2019s president Benjamin Mays convinced him that the ministry was intellectually respectable.\n\nA midnight kitchen experience over a cup of coffee after he received phone calls threatening to blow out his brains and blow up his house during the Montgomery bus boycott gave the fear-stricken Dr. King a sense of God\u2019s unshakable presence. He said that instead of inherited faith, he had to forge the terms of his own relationship to the Almighty.\n\n\u201cI had to know God for myself,\u201d he explained. \u201cI could hear an inner voice saying to me, \u2018Martin Luther, stand up for righteousness, stand up for justice, stand up for truth. And lo, I will be with you, even until the end of the world.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor the rest of his life Dr. King did just that. His faith propelled him to fight Jim Crow, the ugly hatred it bred in the white soul and the haunting inferiority it left in black minds. It led him to speak valiantly against the lynching, bombing and shooting of black people who merely wanted what white people took for granted: a cup of coffee at any lunch counter, a room at any hotel they could afford, a drink at any water fountain they passed, a seat on a bus wherever they pleased and a desk in the nearest schoolhouse.\n\nDr. King\u2019s faith put him at odds with white Christians who believed it was their mission to keep separate the races \u2014 the same people whose forebears believed it was their duty to enslave Africans and punish blacks who sought to escape their hardship. Dr. King realized that he wasn\u2019t simply in battle against a society built on legal apartheid, but that he also had to fight against a racist culture that derived theological support from white Christianity.\n\nWhite evangelicals were opposed to Dr. King because they conveniently divided body and soul: Race was a social issue that should be determined by rules in society and laws generated by government. Such a view meant that the racist status quo was sacred. The point of religion was to save the souls of black folk by preaching a gospel of repentance for personal sin, even as segregation often found a white biblical mandate. After Dr. King spoke at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in 1961, the most prominent institution of the nation\u2019s largest Protestant denomination, many white churches in the South withheld financial contributions to the school.\n\nIf rabid racists were a clear threat to black well-being, it was the white moderates who claimed to support civil rights but who urged caution in the pursuit of justice who proved to be a special plague. In 1963, eight white Alabama clergymen issued a statement pleading for black leaders to slow their aggressive campaign against segregation in Birmingham, Ala. The clergymen cited \u201coutsiders\u201d who had come to Birmingham to lead demonstrations that were \u201cunwise and untimely.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe white clergymen blamed the black protests for inciting hatred and violence through their \u201cextreme measures,\u201d arguing that their cause \u201cshould be pressed in the courts and in negotiations among local leaders, and not in the streets.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nTheir statement led Dr. King, imprisoned for his protests against injustice, to draft his well-known \u201cLetter From Birmingham Jail,\u201d in which he \u201calmost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro\u2019s great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizens\u2019 Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to \u2018order\u2019 than to justice.\u201d It was the same white moderates who led Dr. King near the end of his life to conclude that \u201cmost Americans are unconscious racists.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t only the white church Dr. King had to combat. In 1961 he joined other black ministers who were dissatisfied with the conservative leadership of the National Baptist Convention to form a rival body, the Progressive National Baptist Convention. Dr. King reserved some of his harshest criticism for the black church. Less than two months before he perished, Dr. King and his Southern Christian Leadership Conference organization convened a meeting of ministers in Miami.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t come to Miami to play,\u201d Dr. King warned his listeners in an address titled \u201cTo Minister to the Valley.\u201d And he didn\u2019t. \u201cLet us admit that even the black church has often been a taillight rather than a headlight,\u201d Dr. King preached. As social injustice roared, these ministers kept silent \u201cbehind the safe security of stained-glass windows.\u201d As their members struggled with poverty, they mouthed \u201cpious irrelevancies and sanctimonious trivialities.\u201d\n\nThen Dr. King came in for the kill: \u201cLet us honestly admit that all too often we\u2019ve been more concerned about the size of the wheelbase on our automobiles, and the amount of money we get in our anniversaries, than we\u2019ve been concerned about the problems of the people who made it possible for us to get these things.\u201d Dr. King argued that \u201cthe great tragedy is that Christianity failed to see that it had the revolutionary edge.\u201d\n\nChristianity is again failing to see that edge.\n\nWhile black bodies are punished or disappear into oblivion, under the repressive reign of police brutality, many white churches remain silent. Instead, an overwhelming number of white evangelicals line up in support of a president who has evinced even less of a public embrace of religion than Ronald Reagan did. Yet President Trump has been prayed for by white evangelicals as his administration and his words have preyed on black people, immigrants, transgender people and the poor. There are some brave contrarians among Southern Baptists, like the Trump critic Russell Moore, who have dared to dissent. But their voices are too few.\n\nThe black church\u2019s behavior has been shameful as well. With a few notable exceptions, black churches have often been chronically indifferent to the fight against white supremacy. . On this Easter Sunday, many ministers will dutifully preach about a crucified God without dwelling on the death in Sacramento of 22-year-old Stephon Clark in a police shooting that even the city\u2019s mayor, Darrell Steinberg, said was \u201cplain wrong.\u201d\n\nInstead, black churches have been invested in personal prosperity and upward climbing at the expense of the Social Gospel that Dr. King preached. For every progressive pastor like Frederick Douglass Haynes in Dallas, there are hundreds more who turn their dire warnings about sin into bigger cars and more cash for their lucrative pastoral anniversaries. For every preacher of the virtue of social conscience, like Gina Stewart in Memphis, there are so many more pastors who use the Bible only to reprimand fornicators and backsliders.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome black ministers have even frowned on Dr. King for his moral failures as an excuse to avoid the message that he trumpeted as an itinerant preacher for social justice. To Dr. King\u2019s credit, he acknowledged his flaws and warned people against making him a saint.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. was a man of faith who didn\u2019t mind making trouble for God. He believed his purpose in life was to bring justice to as many of God\u2019s children as possible while proclaiming the revolutionary power of belief. And that wasn\u2019t a mere metaphor: He believed that America must undergo a \u201crevolution of values\u201d so that it might begin to fulfill the mandate of the Gospel to look after those who needed God\u2019s help the most.\n\n\u201cGod didn\u2019t call America to do what she\u2019s doing in the world now,\u201d Dr. King said in his famous \u201cDrum Major Instinct\u201d sermon, delivered from his home pulpit at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta two months before his assassination. \u201cGod has a way of even putting nations in their place. The God that I worship has a way of saying, \u2018Don\u2019t play with me.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs America in its present incarnation, with its present leadership, teeters toward an arrogance, isolationism and self-importance that are the portals of moral decline and political self-destruction, the nation must recall the faith of Martin Luther King Jr. He saw faith as a tool for change, a constant source of inspiration to remake the world in the just and redemptive image of God. On this holy day, instead of shrinking into the safety of faith, we should, as Dr. King did, bear the burdens of the less fortunate and rise again to serve humanity.", "keywords": ["believed", "god", "justice", "dr", "king", "black", "social", "white", "preacher", "forgot", "church", "faith"], "polarity": 0.05049580906062386, "subjectivity": 0.3681092227388524},

Hundreds of readers left comments, many expressing worry about the possibility that the results could be misinterpreted or nefariously applied. Here are Dr. Reich\u2019s responses to some of the comments. \u2014 The Editors\n\nUnfortunately, science has always been misused. From slavery, to eugenics, to economic Darwinism, to anti-abortion politics, the latest scientific knowledge has been employed in the service of evil. The idea of forestalling such efforts is valiant but fruitless. Science must continue its pursuit of truth, and scientists, as always, must speak out when their discoveries are exploited for harmful purposes. \u2014 Syfredrick, Providence, R.I.\n\nWe scientists always need to keep in mind our social responsibilities and to think about whether what we are doing has positive or negative effects on our world.\n\nWith respect to today\u2019s study of human variation, I am optimistic \u2014 I believe that it has been socially positive. It is making every racist view of the world untenable. In my just-published book, I explain how the ancient DNA revolution \u2014 which has provided far greater power to reveal what happened in our deep past than what was available before \u2014 has done far more to undermine racist beliefs than to support them. As I wrote in the final paragraph of my book:\n\nThe study of human variation has not always been a force for good. In Nazi Germany, someone with my expertise at interpreting genetic data would have been tasked with categorizing people by ancestry had that been possible with the science of the 1930s. But in our time, the findings from ancient DNA leave little solace for racist or nationalistic misinterpretation. In this field, the pursuit of truth for its own sake has overwhelmingly had the effect of exploding stereotypes, undercutting prejudice, and highlighting the connections among peoples not previously known to be related. I am optimistic that the direction of my work and that of my colleagues is to promote understanding, and I welcome our opportunity to do our best by the people, ancient and modern, whom we have been given the privilege to study.\n\nMy book also gives concrete examples of how it is no longer so easy to twist science to support long-cherished stereotypes because ancient DNA is now debunking the stories that used to be made up about the nature of human variation. As I wrote there:\n\nThe Nazi ideology of a \u201cpure\u201d Indo-European-speaking Aryan race with deep roots in Germany, traceable through artifacts of the Corded Ware culture, has been shattered by the finding that the people who used these artifacts came from a mass migration from the Russian steppe, a place that German nationalists would have despised as a source. The Hindutva ideology that there was no major contribution to Indian culture from migrants from outside South Asia is undermined by the fact that approximately half of the ancestry of Indians today is derived from multiple waves of mass migration from Iran and the Eurasian steppe within the last five thousand years. Similarly, the idea that the Tutsis in Rwanda and Burundi have ancestry from West Eurasian farmers that Hutus do not \u2014 an idea that has been incorporated into arguments for genocide \u2014 is nonsense. We now know that nearly every group living today is the product of repeated population mixtures that have occurred over thousands and tens of thousands of years. Mixing is in human nature, and no one population is \u2014 or could be \u2014 pure.\n\nHaving been immersed in the ancient DNA revolution for the past 10 years, I am confident that anyone who pays attention to what it is finding cannot come away feeling affirmed in racist beliefs. My childhood guesses about who we are and how we\u2019re related to one another \u2014 and about the nature of differences among people \u2014 have been shown to be wrong again and again.", "keywords": ["race", "ancestry", "science", "ancient", "racist", "nature", "talk", "wrote", "variation", "genetics", "opinion", "idea", "human", "dna"], "polarity": 0.11693773993302296, "subjectivity": 0.46492281303602045},

Mr. Trump\u2019s tougher stance on China may also help ward off industry rivals, with the president squashing a hostile bid to acquire the chip maker Qualcomm this month. And Mr. Trump let die an Obama-era rule that required many tech start-ups to give some workers more overtime pay.\n\nMr. Trump \u201chas been great for business and really, really good for tech,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, who leads the Consumer Technology Association, the largest American tech trade group, with more than 2,200 members including Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook.\n\nMr. Shapiro said that he had voted for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump\u2019s opponent, in 2016, but that he and many tech executives had come around on Mr. Trump. While they disagree with him on immigration and the environment, they have found areas where their interests align, like deregulation and investment in internet infrastructure.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t Hitler or Mussolini here,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. And even though the president\u2019s new tariffs on steel and aluminum could hurt American businesses and consumers, \u201cdisagreement in one area does not mean we cannot work together in others,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cEveryone who is married knows that.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump himself has taken to naming tech companies he says are on his side.\n\nAfter Apple took advantage of the new tax law in January to bring back most of the $252 billion cash hoard that it had parked overseas, the company said it would make a $350 billion \u201ccontribution to the U.S. economy\u201d over the next five years. That prompted Mr. Trump to suggest he had made good on a campaign pledge to get Apple to bring jobs back to the United States.\n\n\u201cYou know, for $350 million, you could build a beautiful plant. But for $350 billion, they\u2019re going to build a lot of plants,\u201d the president told members of Congress last month. Mr. Trump said he had called Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, to personally thank him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn fact, Apple has no plans to build a plant in the United States. The company is uneasy with Mr. Trump\u2019s invoking it to signify how his policies are working, according to a person close to Apple who was not authorized to speak publicly. Apple has not, however, publicly corrected the president.\n\nMr. Trump has also stayed quiet on the controversy engulfing Facebook over user privacy, while other politicians have called for more regulations after revelations that the British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested the information of 50 million Facebook users. Cambridge Analytica used that data to aid Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nMichael Kratsios, the White House\u2019s deputy chief technology officer, said in an interview that while Mr. Trump and Silicon Valley had their differences, \u201cin places where we do see eye to eye, I think we\u2019re achieving extraordinary success.\u201d\n\nDean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, a 102-year-old advocacy group that represents the biggest tech firms, said his members walked a tightrope, supporting and opposing the president on different issues. Lately, he said, \u201cwe have reached balance in the tightrope.\u201d\n\nThe equilibrium marks a turnabout from what had been a testy relationship between Mr. Trump and the tech sector. On the campaign trail in 2016, Mr. Trump was so critical of tech companies that Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, once joked he might send Mr. Trump to space in a rocket.\n\nSome tech executives have since disagreed with Mr. Trump on social issues. Mr. Cook emailed staff last June to say he had unsuccessfully lobbied the president to remain in the Paris climate accords. In November, Microsoft sued the administration to protect a law that blocks deportation of young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers. More than 100 companies, including Google, Facebook and Uber, filed a brief supporting California\u2019s lawsuit on that issue.\n\nEven so, tech executives worked to build a relationship with the president, with some meeting him at Trump Tower before his inauguration and again at the White House in June. While in Washington for the second meeting, Mr. Cook and Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, also dined with Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s senior adviser and son-in-law, and Ivanka Trump at the couple\u2019s Washington home, according to a person briefed on the meeting who wasn\u2019t authorized to speak publicly about it. This month, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin visited Apple\u2019s headquarters.\n\nSilicon Valley has found plenty to like about the Trump presidency. In September, tech giants including Facebook and Microsoft teamed up with the administration to pledge $500 million to computer science education. Amazon, Microsoft and Google are also eyeing the administration as a potential customer as Mr. Trump pushes to modernize the government\u2019s digital infrastructure.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut Silicon Valley\u2019s favorite thing about Mr. Trump is almost certainly his new tax code. Many tech companies lobbied for corporate tax reform for years before Mr. Trump signed the new tax bill.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTech giants immediately reaped the benefits. Under the new rules, Apple saved $43.7 billion in taxes, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan research group. Apple then announced the $350 billion \u201ccontribution\u201d to the economy over five years.\n\nMost of the tally was previously planned spending with American suppliers and a $38 billion tax payment on its overseas cash. But Apple also said it planned to hire 20,000 new workers, invest in new data centers and another domestic campus, and increase a fund for innovative American manufacturers to $5 billion from $1 billion. It also gave employees $2,500 bonuses.\n\nThe president was quick to tweet the news.\n\nThe shifting relationship between Silicon Valley and Mr. Trump appears to have upset some tech employees. A Facebook page called \u201cAngry Googler,\u201d with nearly 1,000 followers, has been dedicated to criticizing Google for any sign it was cooperating with the president.\n\n\u201cNot happy about Google pulling a 180 and jumping into bed with Trump? Same here,\u201d said the \u201cAbout\u201d section of the page, which suggests it is run by a Google employee. This month, the page posted an article about Google helping the Defense Department analyze drone footage. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from organizing the world\u2019s information to \u2026 optimizing weapons of war,\u201d the page said.\n\nMessages to the account were not returned. Google declined to comment.\n\nSome tech firms remain discomfited about appearing as the president\u2019s allies. Last month, Rob Goldman, Facebook\u2019s vice president of advertising, played down Russia\u2019s impact on the 2016 election after the Justice Department charged 13 Russians with trying to subvert its outcome, including by using Facebook. Mr. Trump retweeted Mr. Goldman approvingly.\n\nFacebook was uncomfortable with that association with the president, said a person close to the company who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nTwo days later, Facebook\u2019s policy chief, Joel Kaplan, distanced the company from Mr. Goldman\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cThe special counsel has issued its indictments, and nothing we found contradicts their conclusions,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAny suggestion otherwise is wrong.\u201d", "keywords": ["start", "facebook", "tax", "apple", "tech", "month", "billion", "valley", "president", "silicon", "trump", "warms", "mr", "chilly", "google"], "polarity": 0.12322803382254603, "subjectivity": 0.37953995530215034},

He was considering expanding his media and events businesses into Saudi Arabia and also was hunting for moneyed partners in acquisitions.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe intersection of the tabloid publisher with the Saudis, enhanced by the White House visit, is a previously untold chapter in the long, symbiotic relationship between the president and Mr. Pecker, which was forged in the 1990s. At the time, Mr. Trump was celebrating a real estate comeback after his casino bankruptcies and was both the subject and the source of much gossip in New York.\n\nMr. Pecker, who had known Mr. Grine only for a few months, invited him to the dinner to thank him for advice he had provided about investing in the Middle East, according to someone who knew of the invitation.\n\nWord soon traveled back to Saudi Arabia about the dinner: It signaled Mr. Pecker\u2019s powerful status in Washington.\n\nTwo months later, he was in Saudi Arabia, meeting with Mr. Grine and the crown prince about business opportunities there, according to A.M.I.\n\nAnd by January, Mr. Pecker was confident enough about his growing rapport with Saudi investors that he sought their help bankrolling a possible acquisition of Time magazine, which he had long coveted, according to two people with direct knowledge of the talks.

But he is still working to cultivate ties. This week, he and Mr. Grine both attended events in New York featuring Prince Mohammed, who is on a tour across the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAhead of that visit, A.M.I. published a 97-page glossy magazine that is essentially a promotional brochure for Saudi Arabia and the crown prince. It makes no mention of anything troubling, like the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen, human rights concerns or the crown prince\u2019s arrest last fall of many extended royals, including Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, an influential client of Mr. Grine\u2019s.\n\nThe magazine \u2014 which refers to Saudi Arabia throughout as \u201cthe Magic Kingdom\u201d \u2014 includes an interview with Mr. Grine, accompanied by a photo of him posing with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, taken during his visit with Mr. Pecker. It talks up the relationship between Mr. Trump and the Saudis, noting that Mr. Trump \u201cendorsed the crown prince\u2019s high profile anticorruption\u201d crackdown.\n\nA.M.I. has said it produced the magazine to \u201ccapitalize\u201d on interest in the crown prince, who is next in line to the throne, and has been careful to say it received no input or guidance from Saudi officials. That carries important legal implications: Foreign direction or control of such a purely promotional publication may require disclosure to the Justice Department. The Saudi government did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe magazine \u2014 200,000 copies distributed in Walmart and other outlets, with a cover price of $13.99 and no advertising \u2014 provided a unique welcome mat for the prince, whose visit comes as the Trump administration is trying to establish tighter ties with the kingdom. Both countries are touting cross-border investment opportunities, including a pledge by the Saudi government to put $20 billion into a fund that will invest in American infrastructure projects. The kingdom is also nearing a deal to buy American-made missiles and other military equipment.\n\nMr. Grine, a 30-year-old French citizen, has helped broker deals between Saudi investors and companies in France, Senegal and the United States.

Comey. And in January, a former spokesman for Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team had planned to tell investigators that Ms. Hicks had once said emails written by Donald Trump Jr. before a Trump Tower meeting \u2014 in which the younger Mr. Trump said he was eager to receive political dirt about Hillary Clinton from the Russians \u2014 would \u201cnever get out,\u201d a claim her lawyer has forcefully denied.\n\nTestifying in a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee weeks after Mr. Porter resigned from the White House, Ms. Hicks said that her job sometimes required her to tell \u201cwhite lies\u201d on behalf of the president.\n\nHours later, she announced she would leave the White House. Ms. Hicks, who avoids interviews with the news media, issued a statement saying she had \u201cno words\u201d to express her gratitude to the president. She had told her family and a few friends three days before that she planned to leave.\n\nIt had become clear to others that by the end of her tenure Ms. Hicks was exhausted by West Wing infighting and the daily grind of spending most of her waking hours on call to the president. It was a grueling lifestyle.\n\nAfter waking up and often sending her first emails of the day around 4:30 a.m., Ms. Hicks would squeeze in a workout. Then, for much of the work day, she could usually be found in her closet-size office, where she would wait for the president\u2019s inevitable call: \u201cHopester,\u201d Mr. Trump would say, or \u201cHopey!\u201d He sought her advice on any number of unfolding crises facing the White House, but also to check his instincts against hers.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Hicks never cultivated a life outside the White House.\n\nSeveral current and former aides praised her political instincts and understanding of Mr. Trump\u2019s messaging.

Instead, he has proposed the death penalty for drug dealers, entered into haphazard diplomacy talks with North Korea, and gone back and forth on his views on tariffs. And on Thursday, in an appearance in Ohio that was supposed to be about infrastructure, he seemed to stall a trade deal that had already been negotiated with South Korea.\n\nThere is a palpable worry among those in the West Wing about who the president will now confide in \u2014 and how many other people might be able to occasionally pull him back \u2014 now that Ms. Hicks is gone.\n\nShe is also among the people the staff relied on to bolster flagging morale \u2014 one White House official described her departure as a mother leaving her children behind. To cut the tension in a chaotic workplace, Ms. Hicks baked cookies for aides on Valentine\u2019s Day, swapped country music song recommendations and texted her colleagues funny video clips.\n\nAnother person who has had conversations with both the president and Ms. Hicks in recent weeks, speaking on the condition of anonymity so as not to divulge private conversations, said that Mr. Trump relied on her and trusted her implicitly, mainly because she had never shown a willingness to put her own agenda ahead of his. She had also gained the trust of others in the Trump family for her loyalty.\n\n\u201cHope is exceptional in every way and is loved by all who know her,\u201d Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and senior adviser, said in a statement. \u201cShe is brilliant, dedicated and compassionate \u2014 a unique talent.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s chief of staff, John F. Kelly, has told several people he might leave the communications director role open for a time. But Tony Sayegh, a spokesman for the Treasury Department, is said to be up for consideration for the job, along with Mercedes Schlapp, the director of strategic communications. Another possible choice is Kellyanne Conway, who, crucially, is one of few senior aides able to communicate on Mr. Trump\u2019s wavelength, as Ms. Hicks could.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor now, at least, the small office next to the Oval Office, a space reserved for a Trump confidante, will be filled by Dan Scavino, the director of social media and the only remaining Trump campaign original still in the White House. Before Ms. Hicks, that space was used by Keith Schiller, the president\u2019s longtime bodyguard, when he worked in the West Wing.\n\nMs. Hicks, true to form, declined multiple requests to comment for this article. She has been coy with people who ask about where she will work next, or her plans for a vacation after a nonstop grind over three years, though she has told friends she is ready for a break. Regardless, she is likely to remain among those in the Trump alumni orbit, populated by other former White House and campaign aides the president tends to phone.\n\nOn her last day, Ms. Hicks had already sent 50 handwritten notes to senior staff and other people.

But the real killer of both 3-year-olds is revealed to the reader before the wrong men are even put on trial. We are also spared the anguish of wondering if the system will ever get it right, for we know the men have already been freed thanks to the work of the nonprofit criminal exoneration organization the Innocence Project.\n\nThe crime having been solved early on, Balko and Carrington devote the bulk of the book to pulling back the curtain on the justice system\u2019s little-known but systemic problem that put Brewer and Brooks behind bars: faulty and biased forensic evidence. Junk science convicted these men; real science set them free. The inability of judges and jurors to tell the difference is why innocent men languish in jail while the prosecutors who put them there run for higher office.\n\nPhoto\n\nMississippi would have been better served by the actual actors from \u201cCSI\u201d conducting its forensic investigations than the autopsy specialist Steven Hayne and his \u201csidekick,\u201d the bite-mark analyst Michael West.

But it was also geared toward upper-middle-class viewers, Ms. Dungey said.\n\nBy November 2016, ABC was coming off a TV season when it had finished in last place among the four major broadcast networks, with little hope of escaping the ratings basement in the near future. Like other networks, it was also losing viewers to Netflix and other streaming platforms.\n\nThe meeting that took place on the morning after Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise victory led the network to reconsider its strategy. Mr. Sherwood summed up what was going through his mind that day: \u201cGiven the declines of broadcast television, the year-after-year declines, are we programming in a way that is turning people off?\u201d\n\nIn response, ABC decided to back the singing competition show \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d less than two years after it had been canceled on Fox, its original network home.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe went after it because that\u2019s a show that, fundamentally, is about the American dream,\u201d Mr. Sherwood said. \u201cIt\u2019s about a girl with a cowboy hat and a boy with a banjo and people from small towns where music has saved their lives in different ways.\u201d\n\n\u201cRoseanne,\u201d which had its first run on ABC from 1988 to 1997, was another prime candidate for a reboot. It was a top-rated comedy that had won its share of Emmys and Golden Globes \u2014 not to mention that the woman who played its title character had become a vocal Trump supporter.\n\nEven as the president portrayed the success of \u201cRoseanne\u201d as a win of his own, however, ABC executives and \u201cRoseanne\u201d producers rejected the notion that the show\u2019s popularity was mainly because of its appeal to Trump supporters.\n\n\u201cI would compare this to \u2018All in the Family,\u2019\u201d said Tom Werner, an executive producer of \u201cRoseanne\u201d and other hit sitcoms like \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d and \u201c3rd Rock From the Sun.\u201d \u201cA number of people watching \u2018All in the Family\u2019 said, \u2018Archie\u2019s a conservative and therefore it\u2019s a show about a conservative.\u2019 Well, it was made by Norman Lear.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason the show is successful is because it taps into the frustration and disappointment that working-class people feel about the economy right now,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut if you watch all the episodes, we don\u2019t really mention politics as much as we did in the pilot.\u201d\n\nMr. Werner pointed out that \u201cRoseanne\u201d will deal with the opioid epidemic and immigration in its seven remaining episodes, adding that the president does not come up much as the show goes on.\n\nAs a topical, working-class sitcom led by a Trump supporter, \u201cRoseanne\u201d is unique \u2014 for now. Its early ratings success is likely to spur copycats in Hollywood, which is not known for its high percentage of conservatives.\n\n\u201cMoney is the ideology of Hollywood,\u201d said Martin Kaplan, director of the Norman Lear Center for media and society at the University of Southern California. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine an executive who would turn down something for ideological reasons that they think has a chance to do a good number.\u201d", "keywords": ["heartland", "abcs", "trumps", "success", "president", "strategy", "mr", "ms", "abc", "ratings", "trump", "network", "roseanne", "victory", "sprang", "sherwood", "reboot"], "polarity": 0.0908357428632278, "subjectivity": 0.3910284427754307},

If you go to Dubai and win the Dubai World Cup, you make $6 million less the fees, so it ends up about $4.8 million.\n\n\u201cYou are weighing these things, and we knew we had a horse who had already shown he was a world-class athlete. Everything was basically right with him, he just needed some time off.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBalancing business with horsemanship, it was determined California Chrome, who had some bone bruising, would go to Taylor Made to rest and ideally race as a 5-year-old. It proved to be the smart, and sporting, decision.\n\n[READ MORE: The Dubai World Cup, a Story of Horses and Money]\n\nCalifornia Chrome romped to an almost four-length victory in Dubai the following March, and his win was ultimately named the Moment of the Year by the National Thoroughbred Racing Association.\n\nHis triumph, which included drama as his saddle slipped, was part of another championship season that culminated in him once again being named Horse of the Year.\n\nComing back as an older horse proved California Chrome\u2019s 2014 Triple Crown run was not a fluke, which made him more commercial as a stallion, and it meant his popularity with the general public continued to grow.\n\nRetired and standing for $40,000, California Chrome \u2014 whose name is a result of the fact he was born in California and has significant white, or chrome, markings \u2014 was bred to 145 mares in the Northern Hemisphere last year. A mare\u2019s gestation period is about 11 months, and the first foals sired by California Chrome are being born this spring.\n\n\u201cWith California Chrome, there is a real pedigree pattern that is very similar to what Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew had,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cTo have that kind of breeding further back in his pedigree, that\u2019s how you get a great horse like that. Seattle Slew had the same kind of breeding, and he ended up becoming a good stallion.\u201d\n\nWhile Taylor Made is all in on promoting its star, whether California Chrome succeeds as a stallion will be determined in the years to come, as his first runners will not hit the track until 2020. A stallion\u2019s fee is initially determined by his own accomplishments and pedigree, then later by how his foals sell, and ultimately, by how his progeny run.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe first two stages are largely speculative, and while the last one is not, it takes years to determine. For example, the most expensive stallion in North America is Tapit, who has wildly outperformed expectations. He first stood for $15,000 before dropping to $12,500 because his popularity waned. When his runners hit the track though, he became the leading sire in the country and now he commands $300,000. Tapit is also an exception to the rule.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe number of stallions that actually make it are probably 1 out of 15, and there might be 3 out of 15 that look like they are going to make it,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThis is a very emotional business. It changes easily, and it is all about having the momentum at the right time.\u201d\n\nTaylor Made is aware that California Chrome\u2019s fans are still invested in his story, and it is part of an initiative called Horse Country, a nonprofit started in Kentucky by farms, equine medical clinics, and other equine attractions looking to offer experiences to the public.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Today, visits with California Chrome and American Pharoah, who is at Ashford Stud, are two of the most common requests.\n\nAccording to Horse Country officials, more than 8,600 fans have come to Taylor Made, and most are there to see California Chrome. This led to the creation of another tour called The California Chrome Experience, which guarantees meeting both the horse and some of his first foals. It is almost sold out.\n\n\u201cI think people were so compelled by California Chrome because of his underdog story and his longevity,\u201d said Anne Hardy, the executive director of Horse Country. \u201cHe was on the track longer than we typically see champions racing now. People love a special way to connect authentically, and that the Taylors would be so open to welcoming guests in so close is exceptional.\u201d\n\nThe Taylors want to help the sport grow, and California Chrome\u2019s popularity is a way to get people to the farm to see behind the scenes. With that in mind, they also partnered with adventure magazine True.Ink to offer fans a chance to vote on a broodmare to be covered by California Chrome with an opportunity to buy into the resulting foal.\n\nAccording to True.Ink, more than 600 people joined the project, which is called The People\u2019s Horse, in an effort to breed the world\u2019s first crowdfunded racehorse. The chosen mare, Colerful Bride, will deliver in April.\n\n\u201cHorse racing for the most part in America is boiled down to brief moments,\u201d said True.Ink\u2019s founder Geoffrey Gray. \u201cThere is the Kentucky Derby and mint juleps and celebrities, and then the year turns. But there is so much more to a horse\u2019s life, and there is more to the experience.\n\n\u201cNot only is this project a way to get people involved in horse racing, but it is another way to be part of California Chrome\u2019s legacy.

Mr. Trump seemed intently focused on delivering his own progress report to supporters on a range of red-meat issues, including his zeal for improving border security, his promise to construct a border wall with Mexico, his administration\u2019s efforts to roll back what he called \u201cjob killing\u201d regulations and his thwarting of Democrats.\n\n\u201cReally, I have gotten done much more than I promised,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe did a lot of things I didn\u2019t even promise.\u201d\n\nIn the driving rain, Mr. Trump made his way to the training center, where he had been scheduled to sell an ambitious plan that would try to leverage $200 billion in federal spending to generate $1.5 trillion in total spending on projects such as tunnels, bridges and highways. White House officials had framed the event as a ramp-up, but this conflicted with the president\u2019s decision to say he would push the plan to next year, declaring that he did not expect it to pass at least until after the November midterm elections.\n\nAlso curiously, Mr. Trump spent little time on the trade deal struck with South Korea this week, which had been a win for his administration. That continued a relatively muted celebration: The announcement of that agreement\u2019s details came not from Mr. Trump or his White House, but from South Korean officials; Trump administration officials unveiled the plan days later in a conference call with reporters.\n\nInstead, Mr. Trump disparaged a previous version of a South Korea trade agreement as a \u201chorror show\u201d and a \u201cHillary Clinton special.\u201d He mused to the crowd that he might hold up finalizing the deal while he pursues planned talks with North Korea.\n\n\u201cCertainly, the rhetoric has calmed down just a little bit, would you say?\u201d Mr. Trump asked the crowd. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how it all turns out.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump seemed to veer off script in other areas as well. At one point, he suggested that he planned to pull American troops out of Syria, where they have aided a military campaign that has recaptured the vast majority of the territory once controlled by the Islamic State, or ISIS. \u201cWe\u2019re knocking the hell out of ISIS,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be coming out of Syria, like, very soon.

As recently as Tuesday, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said that while American forces were no longer in \u201can offensive effort on the ground\u201d and had \u201cdrawn off slightly\u201d to avoid accidental conflict with Russian troops, they continued to play a role. \u201cWe continue the operations in Syria,\u201d he said.\n\nSome foreign policy specialists said a complete withdrawal of American troops from Syria would leave a dangerous void. \u201cIf we\u2019re pulling those troops out, we\u2019re ceding the remnants of Syria to the Russians and the Iranians and the other actors, which actually I would argue would be a big victory for Russia,\u201d said Jamie M. Fly, a Republican scholar at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n\nMr. Trump eventually focused on infrastructure on Thursday, zeroing in on his plan to speed up permitting. But the subject and timing of the president\u2019s focus on his plan, announced in February, are curious. Congressional Republicans have not shown much appetite for taking up the infrastructure package, and neither have Democrats, who prefer proposals with much more federal spending.\n\nMr. Trump acknowledged some of that reality in his remarks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get Democrat support very much,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re probably going to have to wait until after the election.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials have not mounted any sort of effort, in public or private, that matches the scale of the pressure campaign they employed before the passage of Mr. Trump\u2019s signature tax cut package last year. Perhaps the most prominent advocate of the infrastructure proposal, Gary D. Cohn, recently left his post as director of the National Economic Council. His successor, Larry Kudlow, is less enthusiastic about increases in federal infrastructure spending.\n\nThe administration envisions states, local governments and the private sector contributing the bulk of the funds, a recipe that experts doubt would result in anywhere close to the targeted level of investment.\n\nRichard Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which has lobbied for a large infrastructure bill, said he was skeptical that the president\u2019s visit would spur any action.\n\n\u201cHe and Congress didn\u2019t blink whenever they shelled out a trillion and a half dollars in tax giveaways for the rich,\u201d Mr. Trumka said, \u201cbut we haven\u2019t seen a nickel yet for infrastructure. He can talk about it forever, but he\u2019s got to do something.\u201d\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, echoed that sentiment on Thursday. \u201cDemocrats are eager to work with the administration on infrastructure,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there\u2019s been a lack of seriousness on this issue from the White House.\u201d", "keywords": ["heralds", "south", "plan", "officials", "youre", "presidents", "troops", "korea", "delay", "administration", "deal", "trade", "syria", "trump", "mr", "infrastructure"], "polarity": 0.0694902003762763, "subjectivity": 0.3339288910807898},
{"title": "\n                    \u2018He Is Not a Victim\u2019: Our Austin Bomber Coverage Explained                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/reader-center/austin-bomber-media-coverage.html", "text": "In the San Bernardino, Calif., shooting that killed 14 people, law enforcement officials called Tashfeen Malik and Syed Rizwan Farook terrorists. The same was true in Orlando, Fla., where Omar Mateen killed 49 people at a nightclub.\n\nBut in Charleston, S.C., where Dylann Roof murdered nine African-Americans at a historically black church, law enforcement did not label him a terrorist. The same was true in Las Vegas, where Stephen Paddock killed 58 people at a concert.\n\nUnder the law, terrorism is a violent, criminal act intended to intimidate civilians and governments for an ideological, political or religious purpose. In this case, we have yet to see evidence that the attacks in Texas were politically motivated, though certainly there has been suspicion that there was racial animus because the first two victims were African-American.\n\nAnne Barnard, Beirut Bureau Chief: The words \u201cterrorist\u201d and \u201cterrorism\u201d are problematic because there is no universal consensus on what they mean. Thus, the decision to label an attack or attacker \u201cterrorist\u201d is almost always at least partly a political judgment.\n\nContradictions and debates abound over which groups governments list as terrorist and which they don\u2019t. Some examples: The United States\u2019 main partner against the Islamic State in Syria is a Kurdish militia listed as terrorist by a critical NATO ally, Turkey. Hezbollah, which is listed as a terrorist group by the United States government, is also a political party represented in Lebanon\u2019s Parliament. And some groups argue that when a government deliberately bombs civilians, that too should be called terrorism.\n\nIt strikes me that in media coverage in general, \u201cterrorism\u201d is often used as if it were a synonym for \u201cIslamist extremist violence.\u201d That grates on me: Terrorism \u2014 whatever your working definition is \u2014 is a method, not an ideology. It\u2019s a method that could be used, and has been used in history, to further a wide spectrum of different ideologies.\n\nFor these reasons, I try to avoid using the terms terrorist and terrorism at all, unless they are inside quotation marks or refer to a government\u2019s decision to place a group on its designated terrorist list.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring all these years of wrestling with how to cover violence, I have found it more precise and informative to simply describe exactly what the attack was \u2014 how it was done, how many people it killed, whether there is a known or suspected motive \u2014 rather than label it terrorist or not. What\u2019s most important is what crime was committed and what its impact was.\n\nCalling a Black Child a Man\n\nWhy do you (and other outlets) keep referring to Draylen Mason as a man? He was a 17-year-old boy or teen. Calling him a man somehow feels like an effort to desensitize people to his loss. \u2014 Anne, Spokane, Wash.\n\nMarc Lacey, National Editor: I agree with you that, at the age of 17, Draylen Mason was a child, a teenager, one who had a promising future as a musician, as we noted here. There were two instances in which we referred to him as a man. Both were later updated. I appreciate your raising this issue.\n\nTreatment of White Suspects\n\nHe is not the victim! When a POC is the victim they are treated far worse than this \u201cgodly boy\u201d whom we are lucky didn\u2019t kill more people with his bombs. Imagine if he was Muslim. \u2014 Tyrone Dockery When it\u2019s a white kid, we are quick to throw out the \u201cmisguided\u201d or \u201cseverely disturbed\u201d or whatever linkage to their mental state \u2014 TBunkNasty Why are you bending over backwards to try and concoct an image of this evil, hateful killer? Asking neighbors, friends, family for their biased, inaccurate, or revisionist opinions of the killer and his motives does nothing except insult the good people he KILLED. \u2014 Bruce, Seattle\n\nMarc Lacey, National Editor: I agree with readers on this point \u2014 that the only victims in this story are the ones Mark Conditt killed and injured. He is not a victim.\n\nAfter such events, we journalists write profiles of the perpetrators of such attacks as we try to understand their backgrounds and what may have motivated them. Here\u2019s one such piece we did on Omar Mateen and another on Dylann Roof.\n\nWe wrote of Micah Johnson, who killed five police officers and wounded seven others in Dallas in 2016: \u201cThere was a time when he was known as a well-mannered young man \u2014 a regular at his church and a pleasant presence on a tree-lined, suburban, multicultural street in a neighborhood called Camelot. He grew up to serve his country in Afghanistan.\u201d He was African-American.\n\nWhen it comes to Mark Conditt, we\u2019ll continue reporting on what motivated these awful acts and we\u2019ll share what we find. I have not a twinge of sympathy for him, and readers are right that our coverage should not leave the impression he was victimized.\n\nLanguage Used in a Tweet\n\nWhy did you highlight this bomber as \u201cnerdy\u201d and coming from a \u201cgodly family\u201d in a tweet? Do these things make him less of a murderer? Do you see how this reads as, screams of white privilege. \u2014 Regina Reichert, Detroit\n\nCynthia Collins, Social Media Editor: As a practice, we use Twitter to highlight new details as they emerge on stories that are continuing to develop.\n\nPeople had been actively seeking updates on the Austin investigation. Our article had just been updated to include interviews with the suspect\u2019s neighbors. We tweeted quotes from one of these interviews to share another element of our emerging profile of the suspect.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe continued to provide additional updates over the next few hours to this tweet in an effort to provide more context.\n\nHowever, we quickly heard from disappointed readers who believed we painted an overly sympathetic picture of the suspect in this tweet. I share this belief.\n\nWe probably shouldn\u2019t have published a tweet describing how the suspect\u2019s neighbors and peers viewed him without also providing the immediate and necessary contrast that he is suspected of killing Anthony Stephan House and Draylen Mason, and critically injuring others.\n\nTreatment of Muslim Victims and Suspects\n\nThe social and mental state of the perpetrator are in fact important as they help to explain how someone who may seem as normal as you and I, would one day wake up and commit what we view as inexplicable acts. However, it defies all logic and rules out all objectivity to discard this side of the argument/narrative when you are dealing with a brainwashed, deranged Muslim radical. All terrorists are the same in my eye, and they should be in yours too. \u2014 Ramadan Duadu, Dublin\n\nAnne Barnard, Beirut Bureau Chief: This too has its echo in the Middle East. We do try our best to delve into the stories, perspectives and contexts of both victims and perpetrators. It\u2019s not always possible, because of access issues. But at the same time, in the media in general there is a dynamic in which the more bombings happen in a place, the more they come to seem routine and not newsworthy, a thing that \u201cjust happens over there\u201d (unless that place is the United States or Europe). This distorts the fact that the vast majority of victims of Islamist extremist violence are Muslims.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Do we not count as full humans?\n\nAfter a spate of bombings in mostly Muslim countries around the world, I talked with Michel Kilo, a Syrian dissident, in Paris. He was leaning wearily over his coffee at a Left Bank cafe, wondering: Where was the global outrage?\n\nWhere was the outpouring that came after the same terrorist groups unleashed horror in Brussels and in Paris? In a supposedly globalized world, do nonwhites, non-Christians and non-Westerners count as fully human?\n\nI believe one of our jobs as journalists is to demonstrate the common humanity of people whose lives may on the surface look very different from one another, to approach every human being as an individual and to treat every life as equally valuable and interesting. It\u2019s an ideal that we can\u2019t always live up to, but we must work toward especially as we attempt to reach an expanding and increasingly diverse global audience.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCovering Black Victims\n\nWhy did you wait so long \u2014 20 days and 10 days respectively \u2014 to publish profiles of the African-American victims of the bombings? \u2014 Joel Charny, Washington\n\nMarc Lacey, National Editor: We published information on the victims in Austin as soon as we gathered it. The correspondents assigned to this story went more than once to the victims\u2019 families to try to tell more complete stories about them.\n\nIn each case, the families were too traumatized, understandably, to let us in. We wrote what we could from the sidelines. We remain committed to pursuing this, because the story of such a loss is never over. Here is one piece on those who died.\n\nDetails of a Suspect\u2019s Life\n\nI realize that reporting on pieces like the March 22 \u201cA Bomber\u2019s Rampage Exposes Racial Fault Lines\u201d article takes considerably more time than getting quotes from neighbors and classmates, but you MUST consider what good those easy quotes do. Do they tell us anything we need to know, or are you just trying to get anything out in order to take advantage of the news cycle? \u2014 Garrett Bridger Gilmore, Long Beach, Calif. I really don\u2019t care what the bomber\u2019s hobbies were, or what his grandmother thought of him, or whether he was \u201cquiet.\u201d I want to know when and where he was radicalized. I want to know how he learned to make effective killing machines and how he was able to obtain parts and send the first few bombs practically undetected. If that information is still unavailable, perhaps run 100 percent fewer human interest stories on his childhood and wait, or better yet, investigate. \u2014 Anna Holmes, Seattle\n\nMarc Lacey, National Editor: With an event of this magnitude, with consequences so horrific, The Times made the decision to give four correspondents in Austin and four others in New York one assignment: Find out anything possible about this perpetrator and help us understand how he could have committed these terrible acts.\n\nWe fanned out through his neighborhood, school, worksite and anywhere else we could identify, trying to talk to anyone we could find who knew him. We published everything we learned, as we learned it. A story that was sketchy at first was expanded as we went along, filling in new details as we learned them.\n\nWe\u2019re still working to understand this perpetrator, and as we learn more, we\u2019ll pass it along. I can assure you that there is no effort underway to portray him as anything other than what he is, a murderer.\n\nPhoto Selection\n\nI have seen pictures of Mark Conditt with the blond hair he had at the time. And holding an assault rifle. Why hasn\u2019t that one been used? \u2014 David B. Owens, Chicago The photographs used to show suspects is one of the ways that can show racial bias. For example, even in this request for questions, a Facebook photo of Mark Conditt is used rather than an image from video surveillance. In comparison, it is common to see mug shots when discussing people of color. How does The Times evaluate photo choices and is this sort of racial bias specifically considered? \u2014 Alison, Apex, N.C.\n\nCrista Chapman, National Photo Editor: The photo of the suspect that we published was the only one that was confirmed at the time by the wire services that we subscribe to. We were unable to independently confirm other photos that allegedly showed Mark Conditt holding an assault rifle, including the photo referenced by the reader.\n\nThere were also no police mug shots available of Mr. Conditt because he had not previously been arrested.\n\nWe did subsequently publish surveillance video screenshots of Mr. Conditt at the FedEx location when the photos were made available.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStaff Diversity\n\nWhat is your plan to hire and promote more people of color and non-Christian reporters? \u2014 Emily Peterson, Oakland, Calif. What controls do you have in place to check for implicit bias? How many people of color do you have in supervisory/editorial positions? \u2014 Kate E, Central New York\n\nCarolyn Ryan, Assistant Managing Editor: We have aggressively pushed to recruit more people of color, and last year, more than a third of our newsroom hires were people of color, and 60 percent were women. We have also introduced changes to our interview and hiring process to make sure we are selecting people from a diverse pool of candidates and using an interview process that has been developed to eliminate bias.\n\nWe\u2019ve also expanded our outreach to underrepresented groups, partnering with organizations dedicated to diversity in technology (e.g. Code2040), journalism (e.g. National Association of Black Journalists) and media (e.g. The Emma Bowen Foundation). And every year, we run a Student Journalism Institute that provides training for diverse groups of college students interested in pursuing a career in journalism.\n\nAnne Barnard, Beirut Bureau Chief: As a foreign correspondent in the Middle East, I see firsthand how important it is that The Times continue to diversify its reporting and editing staff. We need to reflect not only the makeup of our core audience in the United States but also the communities we cover by including more people with the appropriate language skills and cultural literacy.\n\nThis is important for the accuracy, fairness and richness of our journalism. The same is true of the need to diversify people in the most powerful, decision-making positions at The Times.\n\nWhy Ask These Questions\n\nHonestly to even ask this question [\u201cHow do you see racial and religious bias playing out in news coverage?\u201d] is a farce as if you cannot see the writing on the wall. Black and Muslim people have said this for years. To ask this is like you have not been paying attention. How do we see it play out? Open your eyes. \u2014 Hannah Drake\n\nHanna Ingber, Reader Center\u2019s Editorial Director: Thank you for your comment. I see how it came across that way and do understand where you\u2019re coming from.\n\nWe invited readers to submit questions and comments because we want to be more transparent, and we believe it\u2019s important to have an open conversation with our readers about these issues. We are listening to our readers\u2019 feedback and concerns, and we want our audience to know that.\n\nAdditional Reader Points\n\nIn responding to the reader submissions, our journalists focused on questions related to our Austin coverage. But many of our readers posed important and thoughtful questions that went far beyond the Austin story. Questions touched on coverage of past news events by The Times, media coverage from various news organizations and even racial and religious discrimination in society as a whole.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t have answers for many of these questions, they are worth all of us thinking about and keeping in our mind going forward. Here is a selection.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s almost nonexistent for news media to use flattering images of people of color in crime reporting, even if that person is innocent or the victim. \u2014 R. A. Rodriguez\n\nThe coverage is ABSOLUTELY different for White Christian attackers. Had the Austin terrorist been Muslim, there would have been national hysteria. It\u2019s a double standard and must be called out every time. \u2014 Hesham Hassaballa, Chicago\n\nTrayvon Martin was murdered by an over-excited wannabe security guard because he was black and walking through the neighborhood, but somehow the NYT had to tell us all that he\u2019d had trouble at school for pot. The photos of him that were posted weren\u2019t the smiling, friendly sort, like the one posted of Mark Conditt, but was of him in a hoodie, trying to look tough. \u2014 Laura Kenney, Traverse City, Mich.\n\nYou literally have harder hitting profiles of black murder victims than of white Christian serial killers. \u2014 Dylan Brady, Eugene, Ore.\n\nI often see coverage of violent criminals who are Muslim include reactions from the leader or members of their religious community. It is not often asked of Christian faith leaders how the sins of their congregant reflect on the congregation or Christians at large. \u2014 Angelo M. Pinto, Audubon, N.J.\n\nWhenever any sort of mass murder is perpetuated by someone from the \u201cother\u201d category, the entire community is dragged onto the public forum with only one expectation \u2014 own it and repent.\u2014 Nish Patel, Boston", "keywords": ["continue", "terrorist", "national", "victims", "victim", "conditt", "explained", "main", "readers", "austin", "used", "muslim", "coverage", "bomber"], "polarity": 0.08031838551773898, "subjectivity": 0.4224687465312465},

The research was based on data about virtually all Americans now in their late 30s.\n\nThis first animated chart illustrates one of the study\u2019s main findings: White boys who grow up rich are likely to remain that way, while black boys raised in similarly wealthy households are more likely to fall to the bottom than stay at the top in their own adult households.\n\nBlack and white boys raised in wealthy families\n\nFollow the lives of these Americans and see where they end up as adults: Replay \u21ba\n\nIn the days since that article was published, we\u2019ve heard from many readers eager to know more \u2013 about women, about other racial groups and about the differences between individual income and household income. The charts below make several such comparisons, and at the bottom of this page, we\u2019ve created a tool that lets you make these animations for virtually any combination of race, gender, income type and household income level. If you\u2019re an American born between 1978 and 1983, you are most likely reflected in this data (most of us at The Times who worked on this project are, too).\n\nBlack and white girls raised in poor families, as measured by individual income\n\nFollow the lives of these Americans and see where they end up as adults: Replay \u21ba\n\nBlack and white women raised in families with comparable incomes earn more similar amounts as individuals in adulthood. Previous research has suggested that black women may work longer hours than white women to compensate for the fact that they\u2019re more likely to be the sole earner in a family. But \u2014 contrary to that idea \u2014 this data found that black and white women from similar backgrounds in this age group worked a similar number of hours per week, and made about the same amount of money per hour. They also had similar occupations.\n\nBlack and white girls raised in poor families, as measured by household income\n\nFollow the lives of these Americans and see where they end up as adults: Replay \u21ba\n\nBlack women\u2019s economic prospects are still different from white women\u2019s, however. As individuals, black and white women who start from the same place have comparable incomes. But white women are significantly more likely to marry than black women are, and that means they\u2019re also more likely to have a second income at home. The household incomes of white women, as a result, are higher on average.\n\nAsian-American and white children raised in middle-class families, as measured by household income\n\nFollow the lives of these Americans and see where they end up as adults: Replay \u21ba\n\nBoth Asian-Americans and whites are likelier to move up the income ladder than down it. One reason Asian-Americans appear to have higher upward mobility rates than whites is that the children of Asian immigrants do particularly well in this data. If we look only at children whose mothers were born in the United States, Asian-Americans and whites fare about equally well.\n\nBlack and Hispanic children from all income groups, as measured by household income\n\nFollow the lives of these Americans and see where they end up as adults: Replay \u21ba\n\nBoth Hispanic and black Americans grow up to earn less than whites raised at the same income level. But Hispanics are on track to close that gap in several generations if mobility stays the same, while blacks are not. (The data included Americans born in the United States and authorized immigrants.)\n\nWhite boys and white girls from all income groups\n\nFollow the lives of these Americans and see where they end up as adults: Replay \u21ba\n\nAnother way to think about this data is that white men earn more than almost anyone else. They earn more than black men and they earn more than white women. Both gender and race contribute to inequality, and white men hold advantages in both ways.

Mahoney, a pro-segregation Democrat. But his mood soon turned. He became obsessed with black \u201cagitators\u201d; he had state law enforcement spy on civil rights activists, and when King was killed he shut down Bowie State University, one of the state\u2019s historically black campuses, because he feared the students would riot.\n\nLike many conservatives in both parties, Agnew was convinced that the wave of rioting in the late 1960s wasn\u2019t the expression of black frustration over urban unemployment, discrimination and police brutality, but was the result of a conspiracy by black leaders. \u201cThe looting and rioting which has engulfed our city during the past several days did not occur by chance,\u201d he told his audience that day in Baltimore.\n\nPredictably, and justifiably, the state\u2019s civil rights leaders excoriated him. But they were drowned out by the thousands of Americans who voiced praise. According to Agnew\u2019s office, by the end of April 1968 he had received 7,588 letters and telegrams in support, against only 1,042 in opposition. The state\u2019s suburban newspapers uniformly praised him as well.\n\n\u201cHe was blunt but honest,\u201d wrote the editorial board of The Bethesda-Chevy Chase Tribune. \u201cGovernor Agnew is that type of man who is needed in the White House,\u201d one letter writer told The Washington Post.\n\nAgnew wasn\u2019t the only one taking a sudden hard line on the riots, or using them to build a case against civil rights liberalism in general. Nixon moved further to the right that spring and summer, abandoning his previous sympathy for urban blacks and adopting a fierce law-and-order stance. \u201cThe first civil right of every American is to be free from domestic violence,\u201d he said in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in Miami. On the same day he uttered those words, Nixon named Agnew as his running mate.\n\nTo political insiders and the media, Agnew was a disaster. He fumbled his speeches and once used a crude racial epithet to describe an Asian-American reporter. But as they did with Donald Trump a half-century later, pundits missed Agnew\u2019s fundamental appeal. He said it like it was, and if he dropped an occasional racial slur, well, so did many white Americans.\n\nNixon\u2019s campaign that fall was built on what would be called the Southern strategy, but as the historian Kevin Kruse has noted, it was really a suburban strategy. Nixon played to the middle by eschewing the overt racism of George Wallace. But he deployed a range of more subtle instruments \u2014 antibusing, anti-open housing \u2014 to appeal to the tens of millions of white suburbanites who imagined themselves to be racially innocent, yet quietly held many of the same prejudices about the \u201cinner city\u201d and \u201cblack radicals\u201d that their parents had held about King and other civil rights activists.", "keywords": ["urban", "nixon", "civil", "agnew", "black", "white", "lincoln", "wasnt", "backlash", "rights", "states", "opinion", "party", "racial"], "polarity": 0.005959868224019161, "subjectivity": 0.34280473195567535},

Dr. King would want us to live his specific faith: work to defeat racism, speak out in principled opposition to war and combat poverty with enlightened and compassionate public policy.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn his lifetime, he was disappointed in the complacency of both black and white churches. He would be as disappointed today. The white church largely remains a bastion of indifference to the plight of black people. White evangelicals continue to focus on personal piety as the measure of true Christianity, while neglecting the Social Gospel that enlivens Jesus\u2019 words for the masses. Dr. King saw faith as an urgent call to service, a selfless ethic of concern that, he said, quoting the Hebrew prophet Amos, made \u201cjustice roll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.\u201d\n\nToday, in the midst of resurgent bigotry and deep divisions in this country, faith is too often viewed as an oasis of retreat, a paradise of political disengagement. On this Easter Sunday, as we mark 50 years since Dr. King\u2019s death, it is a perfect and necessary time to remember his faith \u2014 and rekindle its urgency.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. King often declared his preacher\u2019s vocation by citing something like a biblical genealogy of black sacred rhetoric that traced through his family: \u201cI grew up in the church. My father is a preacher, my grandfather was a preacher, my great-grandfather was a preacher, my only brother is a preacher. My daddy\u2019s brother is a preacher. So I didn\u2019t have much choice.\u201d\n\nBut Dr. King\u2019s faith underwent significant change. At first, he was discouraged from the ministry by a strain of black preaching that was long on emotion and short on reason. Then, at Morehouse College, his encounter with preachers like the school\u2019s president Benjamin Mays convinced him that the ministry was intellectually respectable.\n\nA midnight kitchen experience over a cup of coffee after he received phone calls threatening to blow out his brains and blow up his house during the Montgomery bus boycott gave the fear-stricken Dr. King a sense of God\u2019s unshakable presence. He said that instead of inherited faith, he had to forge the terms of his own relationship to the Almighty.\n\n\u201cI had to know God for myself,\u201d he explained. \u201cI could hear an inner voice saying to me, \u2018Martin Luther, stand up for righteousness, stand up for justice, stand up for truth. And lo, I will be with you, even until the end of the world.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor the rest of his life Dr. King did just that. His faith propelled him to fight Jim Crow, the ugly hatred it bred in the white soul and the haunting inferiority it left in black minds. It led him to speak valiantly against the lynching, bombing and shooting of black people who merely wanted what white people took for granted: a cup of coffee at any lunch counter, a room at any hotel they could afford, a drink at any water fountain they passed, a seat on a bus wherever they pleased and a desk in the nearest schoolhouse.\n\nDr. King\u2019s faith put him at odds with white Christians who believed it was their mission to keep separate the races \u2014 the same people whose forebears believed it was their duty to enslave Africans and punish blacks who sought to escape their hardship. Dr. King realized that he wasn\u2019t simply in battle against a society built on legal apartheid, but that he also had to fight against a racist culture that derived theological support from white Christianity.\n\nWhite evangelicals were opposed to Dr. King because they conveniently divided body and soul: Race was a social issue that should be determined by rules in society and laws generated by government. Such a view meant that the racist status quo was sacred. The point of religion was to save the souls of black folk by preaching a gospel of repentance for personal sin, even as segregation often found a white biblical mandate. After Dr. King spoke at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in 1961, the most prominent institution of the nation\u2019s largest Protestant denomination, many white churches in the South withheld financial contributions to the school.\n\nIf rabid racists were a clear threat to black well-being, it was the white moderates who claimed to support civil rights but who urged caution in the pursuit of justice who proved to be a special plague. In 1963, eight white Alabama clergymen issued a statement pleading for black leaders to slow their aggressive campaign against segregation in Birmingham, Ala. The clergymen cited \u201coutsiders\u201d who had come to Birmingham to lead demonstrations that were \u201cunwise and untimely.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe white clergymen blamed the black protests for inciting hatred and violence through their \u201cextreme measures,\u201d arguing that their cause \u201cshould be pressed in the courts and in negotiations among local leaders, and not in the streets.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nTheir statement led Dr. King, imprisoned for his protests against injustice, to draft his well-known \u201cLetter From Birmingham Jail,\u201d in which he \u201calmost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro\u2019s great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizens\u2019 Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to \u2018order\u2019 than to justice.\u201d It was the same white moderates who led Dr. King near the end of his life to conclude that \u201cmost Americans are unconscious racists.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t only the white church Dr. King had to combat. In 1961 he joined other black ministers who were dissatisfied with the conservative leadership of the National Baptist Convention to form a rival body, the Progressive National Baptist Convention. Dr. King reserved some of his harshest criticism for the black church. Less than two months before he perished, Dr. King and his Southern Christian Leadership Conference organization convened a meeting of ministers in Miami.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t come to Miami to play,\u201d Dr. King warned his listeners in an address titled \u201cTo Minister to the Valley.\u201d And he didn\u2019t. \u201cLet us admit that even the black church has often been a taillight rather than a headlight,\u201d Dr. King preached. As social injustice roared, these ministers kept silent \u201cbehind the safe security of stained-glass windows.\u201d As their members struggled with poverty, they mouthed \u201cpious irrelevancies and sanctimonious trivialities.\u201d\n\nThen Dr. King came in for the kill: \u201cLet us honestly admit that all too often we\u2019ve been more concerned about the size of the wheelbase on our automobiles, and the amount of money we get in our anniversaries, than we\u2019ve been concerned about the problems of the people who made it possible for us to get these things.\u201d Dr. King argued that \u201cthe great tragedy is that Christianity failed to see that it had the revolutionary edge.\u201d\n\nChristianity is again failing to see that edge.\n\nWhile black bodies are punished or disappear into oblivion, under the repressive reign of police brutality, many white churches remain silent. Instead, an overwhelming number of white evangelicals line up in support of a president who has evinced even less of a public embrace of religion than Ronald Reagan did. Yet President Trump has been prayed for by white evangelicals as his administration and his words have preyed on black people, immigrants, transgender people and the poor. There are some brave contrarians among Southern Baptists, like the Trump critic Russell Moore, who have dared to dissent. But their voices are too few.\n\nThe black church\u2019s behavior has been shameful as well. With a few notable exceptions, black churches have often been chronically indifferent to the fight against white supremacy. . On this Easter Sunday, many ministers will dutifully preach about a crucified God without dwelling on the death in Sacramento of 22-year-old Stephon Clark in a police shooting that even the city\u2019s mayor, Darrell Steinberg, said was \u201cplain wrong.\u201d\n\nInstead, black churches have been invested in personal prosperity and upward climbing at the expense of the Social Gospel that Dr. King preached. For every progressive pastor like Frederick Douglass Haynes in Dallas, there are hundreds more who turn their dire warnings about sin into bigger cars and more cash for their lucrative pastoral anniversaries. For every preacher of the virtue of social conscience, like Gina Stewart in Memphis, there are so many more pastors who use the Bible only to reprimand fornicators and backsliders.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome black ministers have even frowned on Dr. King for his moral failures as an excuse to avoid the message that he trumpeted as an itinerant preacher for social justice. To Dr. King\u2019s credit, he acknowledged his flaws and warned people against making him a saint.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. was a man of faith who didn\u2019t mind making trouble for God. He believed his purpose in life was to bring justice to as many of God\u2019s children as possible while proclaiming the revolutionary power of belief. And that wasn\u2019t a mere metaphor: He believed that America must undergo a \u201crevolution of values\u201d so that it might begin to fulfill the mandate of the Gospel to look after those who needed God\u2019s help the most.\n\n\u201cGod didn\u2019t call America to do what she\u2019s doing in the world now,\u201d Dr. King said in his famous \u201cDrum Major Instinct\u201d sermon, delivered from his home pulpit at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta two months before his assassination. \u201cGod has a way of even putting nations in their place. The God that I worship has a way of saying, \u2018Don\u2019t play with me.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs America in its present incarnation, with its present leadership, teeters toward an arrogance, isolationism and self-importance that are the portals of moral decline and political self-destruction, the nation must recall the faith of Martin Luther King Jr. He saw faith as a tool for change, a constant source of inspiration to remake the world in the just and redemptive image of God. On this holy day, instead of shrinking into the safety of faith, we should, as Dr. King did, bear the burdens of the less fortunate and rise again to serve humanity.", "keywords": ["believed", "god", "justice", "dr", "king", "black", "social", "white", "preacher", "forgot", "church", "faith"], "polarity": 0.05049580906062386, "subjectivity": 0.3681092227388524},

Hundreds of readers left comments, many expressing worry about the possibility that the results could be misinterpreted or nefariously applied. Here are Dr. Reich\u2019s responses to some of the comments. \u2014 The Editors\n\nUnfortunately, science has always been misused. From slavery, to eugenics, to economic Darwinism, to anti-abortion politics, the latest scientific knowledge has been employed in the service of evil. The idea of forestalling such efforts is valiant but fruitless. Science must continue its pursuit of truth, and scientists, as always, must speak out when their discoveries are exploited for harmful purposes. \u2014 Syfredrick, Providence, R.I.\n\nWe scientists always need to keep in mind our social responsibilities and to think about whether what we are doing has positive or negative effects on our world.\n\nWith respect to today\u2019s study of human variation, I am optimistic \u2014 I believe that it has been socially positive. It is making every racist view of the world untenable. In my just-published book, I explain how the ancient DNA revolution \u2014 which has provided far greater power to reveal what happened in our deep past than what was available before \u2014 has done far more to undermine racist beliefs than to support them. As I wrote in the final paragraph of my book:\n\nThe study of human variation has not always been a force for good. In Nazi Germany, someone with my expertise at interpreting genetic data would have been tasked with categorizing people by ancestry had that been possible with the science of the 1930s. But in our time, the findings from ancient DNA leave little solace for racist or nationalistic misinterpretation. In this field, the pursuit of truth for its own sake has overwhelmingly had the effect of exploding stereotypes, undercutting prejudice, and highlighting the connections among peoples not previously known to be related. I am optimistic that the direction of my work and that of my colleagues is to promote understanding, and I welcome our opportunity to do our best by the people, ancient and modern, whom we have been given the privilege to study.\n\nMy book also gives concrete examples of how it is no longer so easy to twist science to support long-cherished stereotypes because ancient DNA is now debunking the stories that used to be made up about the nature of human variation. As I wrote there:\n\nThe Nazi ideology of a \u201cpure\u201d Indo-European-speaking Aryan race with deep roots in Germany, traceable through artifacts of the Corded Ware culture, has been shattered by the finding that the people who used these artifacts came from a mass migration from the Russian steppe, a place that German nationalists would have despised as a source. The Hindutva ideology that there was no major contribution to Indian culture from migrants from outside South Asia is undermined by the fact that approximately half of the ancestry of Indians today is derived from multiple waves of mass migration from Iran and the Eurasian steppe within the last five thousand years. Similarly, the idea that the Tutsis in Rwanda and Burundi have ancestry from West Eurasian farmers that Hutus do not \u2014 an idea that has been incorporated into arguments for genocide \u2014 is nonsense. We now know that nearly every group living today is the product of repeated population mixtures that have occurred over thousands and tens of thousands of years. Mixing is in human nature, and no one population is \u2014 or could be \u2014 pure.\n\nHaving been immersed in the ancient DNA revolution for the past 10 years, I am confident that anyone who pays attention to what it is finding cannot come away feeling affirmed in racist beliefs. My childhood guesses about who we are and how we\u2019re related to one another \u2014 and about the nature of differences among people \u2014 have been shown to be wrong again and again.", "keywords": ["race", "ancestry", "science", "ancient", "racist", "nature", "talk", "wrote", "variation", "genetics", "opinion", "idea", "human", "dna"], "polarity": 0.11693773993302296, "subjectivity": 0.46492281303602045},

So someone may be White (Hispanic) or Black (Hispanic) but not simply Hispanic. As a result, many Hispanics check \u201cWhite\u201d or, increasingly, \u201cSome Other Race.\u201d This ill-defined category is what mixed-race Americans, like me \u2014 half Burmese, half Luxembourgian-Irish \u2014 often check.

But the real killer of both 3-year-olds is revealed to the reader before the wrong men are even put on trial. We are also spared the anguish of wondering if the system will ever get it right, for we know the men have already been freed thanks to the work of the nonprofit criminal exoneration organization the Innocence Project.\n\nThe crime having been solved early on, Balko and Carrington devote the bulk of the book to pulling back the curtain on the justice system\u2019s little-known but systemic problem that put Brewer and Brooks behind bars: faulty and biased forensic evidence. Junk science convicted these men; real science set them free. The inability of judges and jurors to tell the difference is why innocent men languish in jail while the prosecutors who put them there run for higher office.\n\nPhoto\n\nMississippi would have been better served by the actual actors from \u201cCSI\u201d conducting its forensic investigations than the autopsy specialist Steven Hayne and his \u201csidekick,\u201d the bite-mark analyst Michael West.

Young people seemed to be growing up in a very different racial environment, and the rising tide of immigration was making America a more diverse place.\n\nUnfortunately, the mid-70s were, by some measures, a kind of a high-water mark.

The description, which has been used to dehumanize black people, set off protests at South African stores that left mannequins toppled and racks overturned.\n\nIn the aftermath, H&M chose a lawyer and company insider, Annie Wu, to lead a new four-person team at its Stockholm headquarters focused on global diversity and inclusiveness.\n\n\u201cWe want to be held accountable,\u201d she said this week in her first interview since taking the job.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t recognize that in this now new age of transparency,\u201d she added, \u201cwhat the brand stands for is super important to people.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nLost in Translation\n\nFast fashion companies, which specialize in low-priced, quickly produced clothing and have grown faster than the apparel industry as a whole for years, are under pressure to be more prolific and provocative as they sell across more borders.\n\nH&M, which added 479 stores last year, now has more than 4,000 stores in dozens of countries.

But some of the outsourced designs have proved problematic.\n\nWhen fashion is contracted out, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot less control, a lot less oversight and involvement from the company along every step of the process,\u201d said Felipe Caro, a business professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has spent years studying Zara.\n\nLast year, critics complained that images of frogs on a Zara skirt resembled a cartoon character called Pepe, which was designated a hate symbol of the alt-right by the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe skirt was designed by an independent Spanish artist, Mario de Santiago, who is based in London. In a statement at the time, he said that the frogs had \u201cno connection at all with anything related to hate, violence or discrimination.\u201d\n\nRicardo Cavolo, another artist who designed for the same collection, said in an email that the design process \u201cwas pretty fast.\u201d He spent two days at Zara\u2019s headquarters in Spain, creating paintings on denim that the company then reproduced without making any suggestions or changes, he said.\n\nSupply chain experts urge more careful, decentralized vetting procedures that send designs through a central checkpoint at headquarters and also past gatekeepers in the country of sale.\n\nSoon after shifting into her new role at H&M, Ms. Wu said, she visited South Africa, where the importance of soliciting local input quickly became clear.\n\n\u201cI thought I was very culturally aware,\u201d said Ms. Wu, who was born in Taiwan, grew up in New York and speaks Mandarin. \u201cI learned so much more just by being in that office.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nA Homogeneous Work Force\n\nA few months ago, during a long day spent styling and photographing products for H&M\u2019s website, no one on the Stockholm set appeared to raise concerns about one more item to process, the hoodie with the offensive message, according to a person familiar with the shoot.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCritics said the garment might have been flagged if H&M\u2019s team was more diverse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so easy to avoid this kind of controversy,\u201d said Angel Sinclair, the founder of the advocacy group Models of Diversity. \u201cIf you care about being culturally sensitive, just be more culturally inclusive of talent and managers in the business.\u201d\n\nH&M has more than 100,000 workers worldwide. But the fashion giant\u2019s board is entirely white. And retail experts said that much of the creative process takes place in and around its European home office, far from many of its markets.\n\nMs. Wu, who reports directly to H&M\u2019s chief executive, Karl-Johan Persson, said she did not know the ethnic or racial backgrounds of the employees and contractors involved with the monkey hoodie. But an internal investigation of the incident \u2014 which she declined to discuss in detail \u2014 showed \u201chow important awareness-raising is generally,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere are hundreds of steps of getting a product to market \u2014 it\u2019s never one point in time where we can say, \u2018It\u2019s your fault,\u2019 because there are teams at work on things, there are approval processes throughout,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to pinpoint when.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nA Need for Speed\n\nH&M and Zara used to stun the industry with their ability to move garments from design to store floor within weeks, when other retailers required more than half a year. But some brands can now perform the same feat much faster, while others, like Amazon and Adidas, are experimenting with on-demand manufacturing.\n\nASOS, an online fashion retailer, adds 4,500 new products to its website each week, according to a recent report from the Fung Global Retail & Technology research firm.\n\nH&M, which has suffered a string of gloomy earnings reports and said this week that it is sitting on $4.3 billion in unsold goods, plans to invest in its supply chain to make it \u201cfaster, more flexible and more responsive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis is a low-tech, low-profit, low-growth industry that is being turned upside down,\u201d said John S.

If you go to Dubai and win the Dubai World Cup, you make $6 million less the fees, so it ends up about $4.8 million.\n\n\u201cYou are weighing these things, and we knew we had a horse who had already shown he was a world-class athlete. Everything was basically right with him, he just needed some time off.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBalancing business with horsemanship, it was determined California Chrome, who had some bone bruising, would go to Taylor Made to rest and ideally race as a 5-year-old. It proved to be the smart, and sporting, decision.\n\n[READ MORE: The Dubai World Cup, a Story of Horses and Money]\n\nCalifornia Chrome romped to an almost four-length victory in Dubai the following March, and his win was ultimately named the Moment of the Year by the National Thoroughbred Racing Association.\n\nHis triumph, which included drama as his saddle slipped, was part of another championship season that culminated in him once again being named Horse of the Year.\n\nComing back as an older horse proved California Chrome\u2019s 2014 Triple Crown run was not a fluke, which made him more commercial as a stallion, and it meant his popularity with the general public continued to grow.\n\nRetired and standing for $40,000, California Chrome \u2014 whose name is a result of the fact he was born in California and has significant white, or chrome, markings \u2014 was bred to 145 mares in the Northern Hemisphere last year. A mare\u2019s gestation period is about 11 months, and the first foals sired by California Chrome are being born this spring.\n\n\u201cWith California Chrome, there is a real pedigree pattern that is very similar to what Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew had,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cTo have that kind of breeding further back in his pedigree, that\u2019s how you get a great horse like that. Seattle Slew had the same kind of breeding, and he ended up becoming a good stallion.\u201d\n\nWhile Taylor Made is all in on promoting its star, whether California Chrome succeeds as a stallion will be determined in the years to come, as his first runners will not hit the track until 2020. A stallion\u2019s fee is initially determined by his own accomplishments and pedigree, then later by how his foals sell, and ultimately, by how his progeny run.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe first two stages are largely speculative, and while the last one is not, it takes years to determine. For example, the most expensive stallion in North America is Tapit, who has wildly outperformed expectations. He first stood for $15,000 before dropping to $12,500 because his popularity waned. When his runners hit the track though, he became the leading sire in the country and now he commands $300,000. Tapit is also an exception to the rule.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe number of stallions that actually make it are probably 1 out of 15, and there might be 3 out of 15 that look like they are going to make it,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThis is a very emotional business. It changes easily, and it is all about having the momentum at the right time.\u201d\n\nTaylor Made is aware that California Chrome\u2019s fans are still invested in his story, and it is part of an initiative called Horse Country, a nonprofit started in Kentucky by farms, equine medical clinics, and other equine attractions looking to offer experiences to the public.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Today, visits with California Chrome and American Pharoah, who is at Ashford Stud, are two of the most common requests.\n\nAccording to Horse Country officials, more than 8,600 fans have come to Taylor Made, and most are there to see California Chrome. This led to the creation of another tour called The California Chrome Experience, which guarantees meeting both the horse and some of his first foals. It is almost sold out.\n\n\u201cI think people were so compelled by California Chrome because of his underdog story and his longevity,\u201d said Anne Hardy, the executive director of Horse Country. \u201cHe was on the track longer than we typically see champions racing now. People love a special way to connect authentically, and that the Taylors would be so open to welcoming guests in so close is exceptional.\u201d\n\nThe Taylors want to help the sport grow, and California Chrome\u2019s popularity is a way to get people to the farm to see behind the scenes. With that in mind, they also partnered with adventure magazine True.Ink to offer fans a chance to vote on a broodmare to be covered by California Chrome with an opportunity to buy into the resulting foal.\n\nAccording to True.Ink, more than 600 people joined the project, which is called The People\u2019s Horse, in an effort to breed the world\u2019s first crowdfunded racehorse.

The same was true in Orlando, Fla., where Omar Mateen killed 49 people at a nightclub.\n\nBut in Charleston, S.C., where Dylann Roof murdered nine African-Americans at a historically black church, law enforcement did not label him a terrorist. The same was true in Las Vegas, where Stephen Paddock killed 58 people at a concert.\n\nUnder the law, terrorism is a violent, criminal act intended to intimidate civilians and governments for an ideological, political or religious purpose. In this case, we have yet to see evidence that the attacks in Texas were politically motivated, though certainly there has been suspicion that there was racial animus because the first two victims were African-American.\n\nAnne Barnard, Beirut Bureau Chief: The words \u201cterrorist\u201d and \u201cterrorism\u201d are problematic because there is no universal consensus on what they mean. Thus, the decision to label an attack or attacker \u201cterrorist\u201d is almost always at least partly a political judgment.\n\nContradictions and debates abound over which groups governments list as terrorist and which they don\u2019t. Some examples: The United States\u2019 main partner against the Islamic State in Syria is a Kurdish militia listed as terrorist by a critical NATO ally, Turkey. Hezbollah, which is listed as a terrorist group by the United States government, is also a political party represented in Lebanon\u2019s Parliament. And some groups argue that when a government deliberately bombs civilians, that too should be called terrorism.\n\nIt strikes me that in media coverage in general, \u201cterrorism\u201d is often used as if it were a synonym for \u201cIslamist extremist violence.\u201d That grates on me: Terrorism \u2014 whatever your working definition is \u2014 is a method, not an ideology. It\u2019s a method that could be used, and has been used in history, to further a wide spectrum of different ideologies.\n\nFor these reasons, I try to avoid using the terms terrorist and terrorism at all, unless they are inside quotation marks or refer to a government\u2019s decision to place a group on its designated terrorist list.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring all these years of wrestling with how to cover violence, I have found it more precise and informative to simply describe exactly what the attack was \u2014 how it was done, how many people it killed, whether there is a known or suspected motive \u2014 rather than label it terrorist or not. What\u2019s most important is what crime was committed and what its impact was.\n\nCalling a Black Child a Man\n\nWhy do you (and other outlets) keep referring to Draylen Mason as a man? He was a 17-year-old boy or teen. Calling him a man somehow feels like an effort to desensitize people to his loss. \u2014 Anne, Spokane, Wash.\n\nMarc Lacey, National Editor: I agree with you that, at the age of 17, Draylen Mason was a child, a teenager, one who had a promising future as a musician, as we noted here. There were two instances in which we referred to him as a man. Both were later updated. I appreciate your raising this issue.\n\nTreatment of White Suspects\n\nHe is not the victim!

Asking neighbors, friends, family for their biased, inaccurate, or revisionist opinions of the killer and his motives does nothing except insult the good people he KILLED. \u2014 Bruce, Seattle\n\nMarc Lacey, National Editor: I agree with readers on this point \u2014 that the only victims in this story are the ones Mark Conditt killed and injured. He is not a victim.\n\nAfter such events, we journalists write profiles of the perpetrators of such attacks as we try to understand their backgrounds and what may have motivated them. Here\u2019s one such piece we did on Omar Mateen and another on Dylann Roof.\n\nWe wrote of Micah Johnson, who killed five police officers and wounded seven others in Dallas in 2016: \u201cThere was a time when he was known as a well-mannered young man \u2014 a regular at his church and a pleasant presence on a tree-lined, suburban, multicultural street in a neighborhood called Camelot.

I have not a twinge of sympathy for him, and readers are right that our coverage should not leave the impression he was victimized.\n\nLanguage Used in a Tweet\n\nWhy did you highlight this bomber as \u201cnerdy\u201d and coming from a \u201cgodly family\u201d in a tweet? Do these things make him less of a murderer? Do you see how this reads as, screams of white privilege. \u2014 Regina Reichert, Detroit\n\nCynthia Collins, Social Media Editor: As a practice, we use Twitter to highlight new details as they emerge on stories that are continuing to develop.\n\nPeople had been actively seeking updates on the Austin investigation. Our article had just been updated to include interviews with the suspect\u2019s neighbors. We tweeted quotes from one of these interviews to share another element of our emerging profile of the suspect.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe continued to provide additional updates over the next few hours to this tweet in an effort to provide more context.\n\nHowever, we quickly heard from disappointed readers who believed we painted an overly sympathetic picture of the suspect in this tweet. I share this belief.\n\nWe probably shouldn\u2019t have published a tweet describing how the suspect\u2019s neighbors and peers viewed him without also providing the immediate and necessary contrast that he is suspected of killing Anthony Stephan House and Draylen Mason, and critically injuring others.\n\nTreatment of Muslim Victims and Suspects\n\nThe social and mental state of the perpetrator are in fact important as they help to explain how someone who may seem as normal as you and I, would one day wake up and commit what we view as inexplicable acts. However, it defies all logic and rules out all objectivity to discard this side of the argument/narrative when you are dealing with a brainwashed, deranged Muslim radical. All terrorists are the same in my eye, and they should be in yours too. \u2014 Ramadan Duadu, Dublin\n\nAnne Barnard, Beirut Bureau Chief: This too has its echo in the Middle East. We do try our best to delve into the stories, perspectives and contexts of both victims and perpetrators. It\u2019s not always possible, because of access issues. But at the same time, in the media in general there is a dynamic in which the more bombings happen in a place, the more they come to seem routine and not newsworthy, a thing that \u201cjust happens over there\u201d (unless that place is the United States or Europe). This distorts the fact that the vast majority of victims of Islamist extremist violence are Muslims.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Do we not count as full humans?\n\nAfter a spate of bombings in mostly Muslim countries around the world, I talked with Michel Kilo, a Syrian dissident, in Paris. He was leaning wearily over his coffee at a Left Bank cafe, wondering: Where was the global outrage?\n\nWhere was the outpouring that came after the same terrorist groups unleashed horror in Brussels and in Paris? In a supposedly globalized world, do nonwhites, non-Christians and non-Westerners count as fully human?\n\nI believe one of our jobs as journalists is to demonstrate the common humanity of people whose lives may on the surface look very different from one another, to approach every human being as an individual and to treat every life as equally valuable and interesting. It\u2019s an ideal that we can\u2019t always live up to, but we must work toward especially as we attempt to reach an expanding and increasingly diverse global audience.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCovering Black Victims\n\nWhy did you wait so long \u2014 20 days and 10 days respectively \u2014 to publish profiles of the African-American victims of the bombings? \u2014 Joel Charny, Washington\n\nMarc Lacey, National Editor: We published information on the victims in Austin as soon as we gathered it. The correspondents assigned to this story went more than once to the victims\u2019 families to try to tell more complete stories about them.\n\nIn each case, the families were too traumatized, understandably, to let us in. We wrote what we could from the sidelines. We remain committed to pursuing this, because the story of such a loss is never over. Here is one piece on those who died.\n\nDetails of a Suspect\u2019s Life\n\nI realize that reporting on pieces like the March 22 \u201cA Bomber\u2019s Rampage Exposes Racial Fault Lines\u201d article takes considerably more time than getting quotes from neighbors and classmates, but you MUST consider what good those easy quotes do. Do they tell us anything we need to know, or are you just trying to get anything out in order to take advantage of the news cycle? \u2014 Garrett Bridger Gilmore, Long Beach, Calif. I really don\u2019t care what the bomber\u2019s hobbies were, or what his grandmother thought of him, or whether he was \u201cquiet.\u201d I want to know when and where he was radicalized. I want to know how he learned to make effective killing machines and how he was able to obtain parts and send the first few bombs practically undetected. If that information is still unavailable, perhaps run 100 percent fewer human interest stories on his childhood and wait, or better yet, investigate. \u2014 Anna Holmes, Seattle\n\nMarc Lacey, National Editor: With an event of this magnitude, with consequences so horrific, The Times made the decision to give four correspondents in Austin and four others in New York one assignment: Find out anything possible about this perpetrator and help us understand how he could have committed these terrible acts.\n\nWe fanned out through his neighborhood, school, worksite and anywhere else we could identify, trying to talk to anyone we could find who knew him. We published everything we learned, as we learned it. A story that was sketchy at first was expanded as we went along, filling in new details as we learned them.\n\nWe\u2019re still working to understand this perpetrator, and as we learn more, we\u2019ll pass it along. I can assure you that there is no effort underway to portray him as anything other than what he is, a murderer.\n\nPhoto Selection\n\nI have seen pictures of Mark Conditt with the blond hair he had at the time. And holding an assault rifle. Why hasn\u2019t that one been used? \u2014 David B. Owens, Chicago The photographs used to show suspects is one of the ways that can show racial bias. For example, even in this request for questions, a Facebook photo of Mark Conditt is used rather than an image from video surveillance. In comparison, it is common to see mug shots when discussing people of color. How does The Times evaluate photo choices and is this sort of racial bias specifically considered? \u2014 Alison, Apex, N.C.\n\nCrista Chapman, National Photo Editor: The photo of the suspect that we published was the only one that was confirmed at the time by the wire services that we subscribe to. We were unable to independently confirm other photos that allegedly showed Mark Conditt holding an assault rifle, including the photo referenced by the reader.\n\nThere were also no police mug shots available of Mr. Conditt because he had not previously been arrested.\n\nWe did subsequently publish surveillance video screenshots of Mr. Conditt at the FedEx location when the photos were made available.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStaff Diversity\n\nWhat is your plan to hire and promote more people of color and non-Christian reporters? \u2014 Emily Peterson, Oakland, Calif. What controls do you have in place to check for implicit bias? How many people of color do you have in supervisory/editorial positions? \u2014 Kate E, Central New York\n\nCarolyn Ryan, Assistant Managing Editor: We have aggressively pushed to recruit more people of color, and last year, more than a third of our newsroom hires were people of color, and 60 percent were women. We have also introduced changes to our interview and hiring process to make sure we are selecting people from a diverse pool of candidates and using an interview process that has been developed to eliminate bias.\n\nWe\u2019ve also expanded our outreach to underrepresented groups, partnering with organizations dedicated to diversity in technology (e.g. Code2040), journalism (e.g. National Association of Black Journalists) and media (e.g. The Emma Bowen Foundation). And every year, we run a Student Journalism Institute that provides training for diverse groups of college students interested in pursuing a career in journalism.\n\nAnne Barnard, Beirut Bureau Chief: As a foreign correspondent in the Middle East, I see firsthand how important it is that The Times continue to diversify its reporting and editing staff. We need to reflect not only the makeup of our core audience in the United States but also the communities we cover by including more people with the appropriate language skills and cultural literacy.\n\nThis is important for the accuracy, fairness and richness of our journalism. The same is true of the need to diversify people in the most powerful, decision-making positions at The Times.\n\nWhy Ask These Questions\n\nHonestly to even ask this question [\u201cHow do you see racial and religious bias playing out in news coverage?\u201d] is a farce as if you cannot see the writing on the wall. Black and Muslim people have said this for years. To ask this is like you have not been paying attention. How do we see it play out? Open your eyes. \u2014 Hannah Drake\n\nHanna Ingber, Reader Center\u2019s Editorial Director: Thank you for your comment. I see how it came across that way and do understand where you\u2019re coming from.\n\nWe invited readers to submit questions and comments because we want to be more transparent, and we believe it\u2019s important to have an open conversation with our readers about these issues. We are listening to our readers\u2019 feedback and concerns, and we want our audience to know that.\n\nAdditional Reader Points\n\nIn responding to the reader submissions, our journalists focused on questions related to our Austin coverage. But many of our readers posed important and thoughtful questions that went far beyond the Austin story. Questions touched on coverage of past news events by The Times, media coverage from various news organizations and even racial and religious discrimination in society as a whole.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t have answers for many of these questions, they are worth all of us thinking about and keeping in our mind going forward. Here is a selection.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s almost nonexistent for news media to use flattering images of people of color in crime reporting, even if that person is innocent or the victim. \u2014 R. A. Rodriguez\n\nThe coverage is ABSOLUTELY different for White Christian attackers. Had the Austin terrorist been Muslim, there would have been national hysteria. It\u2019s a double standard and must be called out every time. \u2014 Hesham Hassaballa, Chicago\n\nTrayvon Martin was murdered by an over-excited wannabe security guard because he was black and walking through the neighborhood, but somehow the NYT had to tell us all that he\u2019d had trouble at school for pot. The photos of him that were posted weren\u2019t the smiling, friendly sort, like the one posted of Mark Conditt, but was of him in a hoodie, trying to look tough. \u2014 Laura Kenney, Traverse City, Mich.\n\nYou literally have harder hitting profiles of black murder victims than of white Christian serial killers. \u2014 Dylan Brady, Eugene, Ore.\n\nI often see coverage of violent criminals who are Muslim include reactions from the leader or members of their religious community. It is not often asked of Christian faith leaders how the sins of their congregant reflect on the congregation or Christians at large. \u2014 Angelo M. Pinto, Audubon, N.J.\n\nWhenever any sort of mass murder is perpetuated by someone from the \u201cother\u201d category, the entire community is dragged onto the public forum with only one expectation \u2014 own it and repent.\u2014 Nish Patel, Boston", "keywords": ["continue", "terrorist", "national", "victims", "victim", "conditt", "explained", "main", "readers", "austin", "used", "muslim", "coverage", "bomber"], "polarity": 0.08031838551773898, "subjectivity": 0.4224687465312465},

The research was based on data about virtually all Americans now in their late 30s.\n\nThis first animated chart illustrates one of the study\u2019s main findings: White boys who grow up rich are likely to remain that way, while black boys raised in similarly wealthy households are more likely to fall to the bottom than stay at the top in their own adult households.\n\nBlack and white boys raised in wealthy families\n\nFollow the lives of these Americans and see where they end up as adults: Replay \u21ba\n\nIn the days since that article was published, we\u2019ve heard from many readers eager to know more \u2013 about women, about other racial groups and about the differences between individual income and household income. The charts below make several such comparisons, and at the bottom of this page, we\u2019ve created a tool that lets you make these animations for virtually any combination of race, gender, income type and household income level. If you\u2019re an American born between 1978 and 1983, you are most likely reflected in this data (most of us at The Times who worked on this project are, too).\n\nBlack and white girls raised in poor families, as measured by individual income\n\nFollow the lives of these Americans and see where they end up as adults: Replay \u21ba\n\nBlack and white women raised in families with comparable incomes earn more similar amounts as individuals in adulthood. Previous research has suggested that black women may work longer hours than white women to compensate for the fact that they\u2019re more likely to be the sole earner in a family. But \u2014 contrary to that idea \u2014 this data found that black and white women from similar backgrounds in this age group worked a similar number of hours per week, and made about the same amount of money per hour. They also had similar occupations.\n\nBlack and white girls raised in poor families, as measured by household income\n\nFollow the lives of these Americans and see where they end up as adults: Replay \u21ba\n\nBlack women\u2019s economic prospects are still different from white women\u2019s, however. As individuals, black and white women who start from the same place have comparable incomes. But white women are significantly more likely to marry than black women are, and that means they\u2019re also more likely to have a second income at home. The household incomes of white women, as a result, are higher on average.\n\nAsian-American and white children raised in middle-class families, as measured by household income\n\nFollow the lives of these Americans and see where they end up as adults: Replay \u21ba\n\nBoth Asian-Americans and whites are likelier to move up the income ladder than down it. One reason Asian-Americans appear to have higher upward mobility rates than whites is that the children of Asian immigrants do particularly well in this data. If we look only at children whose mothers were born in the United States, Asian-Americans and whites fare about equally well.\n\nBlack and Hispanic children from all income groups, as measured by household income\n\nFollow the lives of these Americans and see where they end up as adults: Replay \u21ba\n\nBoth Hispanic and black Americans grow up to earn less than whites raised at the same income level.
