If the United States chooses to take a more punitive approach, \u201cthen I think we are at the brink of heading for a more Cold War-type relationship,\u201d she added.\n\nMr. Liu has been dispatched to Washington to evaluate the likelihood of such a clash, as well as to try to defuse tensions. He plans to tell American officials about areas where the Chinese economy will be opening up and push for an official commitment to restore economic meetings between the two countries, which stalled after a falling-out over trade in July.\n\nMr. Liu was scheduled to meet with a handful of top executives from American companies and organizations on Wednesday, including Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase; Laurence D. Fink of BlackRock; David M. Solomon of Goldman Sachs; Marc Allen of Boeing; Evan Greenberg of Chubb; Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary; and Thomas J. Donohue of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Liu and a Chinese delegation will jointly meet with top administration officials including Gary D. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council; Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative; and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, for a \u201cfrank exchange of views on the trade and economic relationship,\u201d a White House official said. Mr. Liu will not meet with the president himself.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s aides, including Mr. Lighthizer, have discouraged the president from engaging with China. It has been a shift from Mr. Trump\u2019s first months in office, when he warmly received Mr. Xi at Mar-a-Lago and started a new \u201cComprehensive Economic Dialogue\u201d between the countries that would include 100 days of talks over trade.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut when Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross presented the results of those talks to the president, Mr. Trump, counseled in part by Mr. Lighthizer, concluded the outcome was a bad deal for the United States, according to people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. One of the breakthroughs from the 100 days of talks, China\u2019s agreement to start receiving shipments of American beef, was first promised to the Bush administration. Another deal, to lift caps on foreign investment in Chinese insurance, banking and securities, had already been pledged to President Barack Obama.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

But some of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers believe the Chinese used these dialogues not for meaningful exchanges, but simply to stall American objectives as China\u2019s economic power grows.\n\nThe view underlines a broader shift in the United States strategy toward China from using some carrots to a reliance purely on sticks. Mr. Trump has already jettisoned the primary tool that the Obama administration had been using to encourage China to reform \u2014 the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The multicountry deal did not include China, but its members said Beijing would be allowed to join after making significant reforms.\n\nSuspicion of China has only grown in recent months. Mr. Trump\u2019s aides are united around the prospect of trade measures against China, though they differ on how to tailor those measures so as not to hurt American consumers. In addition, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have introduced legislation that would crack down on Chinese investments in the United States that could pose a security risk.\n\nThe Trump administration has introduced tariffs on washing machines and solar cells and modules that are aimed at China, and it is soon expected to announce new restrictions on imported aluminum and steel.\n\nIn its 2018 trade policy agenda released Wednesday, the Trump administration criticized China for undermining market competition and distorting markets, behavior it said had left the world poorer overall.\n\n\u201cCountries that refuse to give us reciprocal treatment or who engage in other unfair trading practices will find that we know how to defend our interests,\u201d the report said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe last few months have been marked by uncertainty, with China experts and Washington trade lawyers expecting tough measures on China to be issued at any time. In return, China has floated retaliation on United States exports of airplanes, sorghum and soybeans.\n\nEconomists say China has fulfilled some of the promises it made to open its economy when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. But under Mr. Xi\u2019s guidance, the country has slowed and even reversed some reforms that would reduce the government\u2019s control over the market, tracking by the Asia Society Policy Institute and the Rhodium Group shows.\n\nAmid this retrenchment, business leaders, policymakers and academics who have long defended China against more hawkish views are suddenly changing their tune.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that post-financial crisis, China\u2019s policies and practices have made it more difficult for foreign investors in some sectors of the economy to compete on a level playing field,\u201d said Myron Brilliant, executive vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThere is a frustration that has been boiling over in recent years that the dialogues have not produced enough tangible results.\u201d\n\nAlthough he stands firmly behind Mr. Xi, the Harvard-educated Mr. Liu has a history of advocating economic reform and more open markets. Mr. Liu is widely thought to be in line for a promotion as China holds a high-profile gathering of top leaders in the coming weeks, potentially to the position of vice premier or to lead the central bank.\n\nExperts on China said Mr. Liu was a familiar figure in the United States, and well-respected by American officials. They put him in the same category as Wang Qishan, another close adviser to Mr. Xi, who is expected to be named vice president.\n\n\u201cIf Wang Qishan and Liu He are special voices in Xi\u2019s ear over the next few years, that\u2019s a good thing for U.S. policy,\u201d said Jeffrey A.

Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have argued forcefully for using diplomacy to address Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nCommanders who attended the exercise in Hawaii were told that roughly 10,000 Americans could be wounded in combat in the opening days alone. And the number of civilian casualties, the generals were told, would likely be in the thousands or even hundreds of thousands.\n\nThe potential human costs of a war were so high that, at one point during the exercise, General Milley remarked that \u201cthe brutality of this will be beyond the experience of any living soldier,\u201d according to officials who were involved.\n\nSo, too, would be the sheer logistical enterprise of moving thousands of American soldiers and equipment to the Korean Peninsula. Moreover, senior military officials worry that after 17 years in Afghanistan and Iraq, American troops have become far more used to counterinsurgency fighting than a land war against a state, as an attack on North Korea would likely bring.\n\nBut Mr. Mattis also has ordered top Pentagon leaders to be ready for any possible military action against North Korea. Already, ammunition has been pre-staged in the Pacific region for ground units.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump\u2019s words \u2014 \u201cMilitary solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely,\u201d he said in an August post on Twitter \u2014 have left senior officers and rank-and-file troops convinced that they need to accelerate their contingency planning.\n\nA White House decision to attack is almost wholly dependent on cooperation from South Korea \u2014 not only in committing its troops or other assets to the battle but also accepting the risk of widespread bloodshed on its civilian population if the North fires back.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith a revival recently signaled on the long-dormant diplomatic track to resolve the Korean crisis, Pentagon officials said they did not want to disrupt any chance for a negotiated resolution. North Korea\u2019s declaration at the end of the Winter Olympics that it was willing to open a dialogue with the United States offered a small amount of hope that the political pageantry of the Games would lead to more substantial results.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s response that the United States, too, was interested in talking compounded that hope. \u201cWe want to talk also,\u201d Mr. Trump said earlier this week, but \u201conly under the right conditions.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBut Trump administration officials still insist that the United States will not sit with North Korea unless Pyongyang agrees to open negotiations on its nuclear program, a condition the North has rejected.\n\nAnd so the planning continues.\n\nMr. Mattis and other senior military leaders fear that a stray incident could spark a sudden conflict with the North. Of particular concern is the \u201cladder of escalation\u201d \u2014 a chain of actions prompted by the shooting down of a North Korean or American jet, or sinking of a ship of which Mr. Mattis and other Pentagon leaders could quickly lose control.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But by going after the shipments, the United States is edging closer to the imposition of an economic blockade on the North.\n\nWhile Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stopped short of saying the United States Navy would forcibly board ships on the high seas, administration officials privately have said that sailors may yet be called upon to do so, if hostile foreign vessels are suspected of transporting certain material to North Korea.\n\nThat, Defense Department officials say, could easily spark an incident that could escalate.\n\nMr. Trump recently referred to another type of incident that American officials fear could spark a war.\n\nDuring a speech in Seoul last year, he brought up North Korea\u2019s 1969 downing an American spy plane that had been flying over the Sea of Japan. All 31 Americans aboard were killed in the attack by two North Korean MiGs.\n\nAt the time, President Richard M. Nixon chose not to retaliate. It is unclear if Mr. Trump would follow the same course; in bringing up the episode last year, he warned, \u201cDo not underestimate us, and do not try us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Hawaii planning exercise looked at a wide range of military capabilities and missions.

Instead of solving the problems, miners use computers to submit a flood of guesses. This can be lucrative: Each Bitcoin is currently valued at about $10,550.\n\nBelievers insist it is a worthwhile endeavor. They describe Bitcoin as a superior currency that will eventually come into wide use, and they predict even broader applications for blockchains, the digital bookkeeping method used to record ownership of Bitcoins and to verify transactions.\n\nBut Bitcoin remains so hard to use that a major Bitcoin conference in January had to stop accepting Bitcoin. It is, in practice, a speculative investment, like gold. And Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University, said mining gold was a better use of resources, because even if it lost value, it could be used to fill teeth.\n\n\u201cOnce the Bitcoin power is burned, it is never coming back,\u201d he said.\n\nColin L. Read, the mayor of Plattsburgh, N.Y., also sees it as a public nuisance. The city was guaranteed a fixed supply of cheap electricity as part of the construction of power-generating dams on the St. Lawrence in the 1950s. Bitcoin mining companies are plugging into that power supply like a swarm of hungry mosquitoes.\n\nMr. Read said that Bitcoin mining now consumes about 10 percent of the city\u2019s power, and that is forcing Plattsburgh to buy a growing amount of extra electricity on the open market, at rates up to 100 times higher than its base cost.\n\nMr. Read, who is also an economics professor, said he would rather sell the city\u2019s supply of cheap power to companies employing large numbers of people. Mold-Rite Plastics, which makes bottle caps, also uses about 10 percent of the city\u2019s power, but it employs about 200 people.

He is the only employee of his company, and he is presently a full-time medical student on the Caribbean island of Grenada. But Bitcoin mining paid his college tuition and it is paying for medical school.\n\nAnd he doesn\u2019t see that Plattsburgh has better options.\n\n\u201cThe place needs all the jobs they can get,\u201d he said, although his company employs no one beyond him.

Enel, the largest European power company, said earlier this month it would not sell electricity to a virtual miner, citing environmental concerns.\n\n\u201cEnel has undertaken a clear path toward decarbonization and sustainable development and sees the intensive use of energy dedicated to cryptocurrency mining as an unsustainable practice that does not fit with the business model it is pursuing,\u201d the company, partly owned by the Italian government, said in a statement.\n\nSome Bitcoin miners emphasize their reliance on renewable energy, but the energy they use might otherwise be put to other purposes. Consider the example of Quebec, one of the world\u2019s largest producers of hydroelectric power. Local demand has flatlined, leading the province to consider exporting electricity to Massachusetts, which is seeking to increase the share of current power consumption generated by sustainable sources. But Quebec is now weighing that possibility alongside a wave of proposals from mining companies.\n\nPhoto\n\nSome American utilities, too, are hungry for new customers. Domestic demand for electricity is in decline as power-hungry industries, like aluminum smelting, have moved to other countries and households are increasingly using LED light bulbs.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re thankful that anyone still wants to use energy,\u201d said Robert McCullough of McCullough Research, an Oregon energy consultancy.\n\nAnd plenty of places are hungry for jobs \u2014 even the relatively few jobs that virtual mining brings.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMassena, the town with the shuttered smelter, is about two hours from Plattsburgh. It also enjoys a guaranteed supply of cheap electricity, but it has lost several of its major employers, including the smelter and a General Motors factory.\n\nThe New York Power Authority reserves 490 megawatts of low-cost power for industrial users in Franklin, Jefferson and St. Lawrence counties, the northern tier that includes Massena. The decline of local industry means only 52 percent of that power is currently committed, which is why officials were delighted when a company called Coinmint proposed to install 16,000 computers in the old aluminum building.\n\nThe company, which is still negotiating contracts, told the power authority it would employ 150 people. Employers historically have created 30.5 jobs in exchange for each megawatt of low-cost electricity, according to the power authority, while Coinmint is proposing to create just new 10 jobs per megawatt.

They have responded by spending tens of millions of dollars to combat consumers\u2019 efforts to untether themselves from the electric grid.\n\nA new study by the Sustainable Investments Institute, a nonprofit group that conducts research on efforts to influence corporate boards, found that utilities had spent $50 million between 2011 and 2016 to block clean energy in seven states: Alaska, California, Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon and Washington.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDespite calling itself the Sunshine State, Florida lags behind states like New York and New Jersey in residential solar installations. But a 2016 campaign resulted in overwhelming voter approval of a constitutional amendment to provide a property tax exemption for solar installations.

When Mr. Trump was planning his campaign in spring 2015, he told Ms. Hicks he was pulling her from Ms. Trump\u2019s team to put her on his small political staff despite her lack of experience.\n\nBut the Trump family trusted her, and that was a crucial factor in her emergence as a key aide to the president, who also valued her loyalty.\n\nYet as the person who spent the most time with Mr. Trump, Ms. Hicks became enmeshed in a number of controversies over the past year, including key aspects of the investigations by Congress and the special counsel, Robert S.

She maintained one of the lowest public profiles of anyone to ever hold the job, declining to sit for interviews or appear on the podium in the White House briefing room.\n\nEven those in the West Wing who did not like her approach feared her power, and worried about crossing her. But some former Trump advisers sounded hopeful that a new staff configuration might create a more consistent approach to governing, in contrast to the way the White House has functioned for the past year, when people close to the president could easily influence him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOther advisers said they were more concerned that Mr. Trump, who has found the White House isolating, would struggle with no close campaign aides nearby.\n\nDan Scavino Jr., the White House digital director, is the only member of the president\u2019s original campaign team still working directly for Mr. Trump. Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Melania Trump, was an early campaign press aide, and the president is fond of her, raising the possibility she could play a role with the West Wing press office.\n\nIt was not immediately clear who will fill Ms. Hicks\u2019s role, although several White House officials and external advisers said they expect that Mercedes Schlapp \u2014 who Mr. Kelly brought in and who was seen by some as a ballast against Ms. Hicks\u2019s influence when he took over the job \u2014 will be elevated in some way.\n\nMs. Hicks had been considering leaving the White House for several months.

He urged backers of a renewed ban on assault weapons to make their case to the authors of the legislation and said he would welcome the opportunity to enact one sweeping bill to combat mass shootings. But Congress has for years been unable to make even incremental headway on new gun buying limits, let alone the type of multifaceted plan called for by the president.\n\nDemocrats would like to persuade Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, to allow votes on major gun control proposals, a plan that could throw the Senate into a full-blown showdown over competing initiatives. But Mr. McConnell is never one to rush into a fight that divides his own party if he can help it.

Credit Susannah George/Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States-led campaign to hunt down the last pockets of Islamic State militants in Syria has lost its most effective battleground partner in what American military officials fear will stall a critical phase of the offensive and leave open the door for hundreds of foreign fighters to escape.\n\nThousands of Kurdish fighters and commanders who make up the backbone of the Syrian Democratic Forces in recent weeks have diverted to defend Afrin, in Syria\u2019s northwest, where other Kurdish militia are facing sharp attacks from Turkish troops.\n\nThe Kurdish-led S.D.F. was the driving force last fall in routing the Islamic State from its self-proclaimed headquarters in Raqqa and chasing insurgents fleeing south along the Euphrates River Valley to the Iraqi border.\n\nThat fight now is largely reliant on Syrian Arab fighters who make up a majority of the S.D.F. but lack the Kurds\u2019 military organization and logistical prowess.\n\nIn congressional testimony on Tuesday, Gen. Joseph L. Votel, head of United States Central Command, described the S.D.F. as \u201cthe most effective force on the ground in Syria against ISIS.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we need them to finish this \u2014 to finish this fight,\u201d General Votel told the House Armed Services Committee.\n\nWithout the Kurds, the Arab forces and their American military advisers have largely been forced to halt clearing operations and taken up mostly defensive positions, United States officials said. That has left American air power to pick up the slack.\n\nThe development is another major consequence of the fighting that has rapidly unfurled in recent weeks in Syria\u2019s tumultuous northwest.\n\nIt threatens not only to slow progress against several hundred Islamic State fighters who are hiding along the Euphrates River or in nearby deserts, but also could allow battle-hardened foreign fighters to escape deeper into western Syria and eventually into Turkey or Jordan \u2014 and possibly to return home to Europe or Africa to commit mayhem there, American commanders and analysts said.\n\nThousands of foreign fighters have already fled unfettered to the south and west through Syrian Army lines, these officials said.\n\n\u201cThe campaign to defeat the Islamic State is at risk,\u201d said Jennifer Cafarella, a senior intelligence planner with the Institute for the Study of War in Washington. \u201cThe S.D.F. is unlikely to clear remaining ISIS-held areas of the Euphrates River and could even begin to take losses due to the shift in Syrian Kurds\u2019 main effort.\u201d ISIS is another name for the Islamic State.\n\nThe turn of events has the potential to upset a triumph that President Trump has held out as one of his administration\u2019s signature national security accomplishments so far.\n\n\u201cISIS land has been largely recaptured \u2014 almost 100 percent,\u201d Mr. Trump said last week during a news conference with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia. \u201cThey are on the run.\u201d\n\nYet senior Trump administration officials and American commanders have been watching, with growing trepidation, as Kurdish troops and commanders divert from the fight against the Islamic State.\n\nInitially, they sought to play down its significance. On Feb. 11, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis called the development \u201ca distraction\u201d and said it was \u201cnot a significant number right now.\u201d\n\nMaj. Gen. Jamie Jarrard, the Special Operations commander for the American-led coalition in Iraq and Syria, said in an interview in early February that the elimination of the entire caliphate was \u201cvery close.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything that disrupts us or takes our eye off that prize is not good,\u201d General Jarrard said.\n\nMr. Mattis, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the White House national security adviser, all have met with Turkish officials in recent days to seek an end to the clashes with Kurdish militia in northwest Syria and prevent the fighting from spreading.\n\nBut by last week, Heather Nauert, the State Department\u2019s spokeswoman, acknowledged to reporters on Feb. 22 that \u201cwe can no longer fight ISIS the way that we would fully like to be able to do.\u201d\n\nImage Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, left, with the Turkish defense minister, Nurettin Canikli, in Brussels earlier this month. A Turkish incursion into Kurdish-held areas in northern Syria has diverted Kurdish forces away from the fight against the Islamic State. Credit Pool photo by Virginia Mayo\n\nThe diversion of Kurdish fighters and lower-level commanders, who play a pivotal role in directing battlefield operations against the Islamic State, has increased from a trickle to a torrent, according to five American military officials who are monitoring the situation and spoke on condition of anonymity. It is difficult to estimate precisely how many Kurdish fighters have withdrawn.\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces number about 50,000 Kurdish and Arab fighters throughout eastern and northern Syria, American military officials have said. Several thousand have been fighting the Islamic State in the Euphrates River Valley, with Arabs making up as much as 80 percent of that force, reflecting the demographics of the region.\n\nBut as they have elsewhere in the fight against Islamic State in Syria, the Kurds have taken on a disproportionate role in front line fighting and command skills, American officials said.\n\nNow some of those gains against the Islamic State are in jeopardy. As of two weeks ago, Kurdish officials said more than 20,000 Kurdish defenders had rallied to Afrin to confront Turkish troops. That number includes fighters who were already there, as well as newly arrived reinforcements.\n\n\u201cThe Turkish invasion to occupy Afrin has terribly influenced our fight against ISIS,\u201d Shahoz Hasan, co-president of the Syrian Democratic Union party, said in an interview on Monday. \u201cAfter we managed to get ISIS in a choke hold,\u201d he said the Turks \u201care attacking our forces in that region.\u201d\n\nFor many Kurdish militia and their commanders, the call to defend family and friends in Afrin and a Kurdish enclave in the city of Manbij that is also threatened by Turkish troops has taken precedence over what many consider to be an American war against the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cThose fighters find it more urgent to be in their areas on the Syrian-Turkish border rather than on the front lines with ISIS,\u201d said Arin Sheikhmos, a Kurdish journalist based in Qamishli. The city is the de facto capital of Kurdish areas of northern Syria, which the Kurds call Rojava.\n\n\u201cTo them, it is a priority to defend their land rather than liberating others\u2019 land,\u201d Mr. Sheikhmos said.\n\nThe American-led coalition appears to have intensified airstrikes on the Islamic State in areas east of the Euphrates River to fill the battlespace the Kurdish fighters had left, Mr. Sheikhmos said. The approach was not working, he said.\n\nHe said the Islamic State carried out a car bombing in Qamishli a few days ago, resulting in the deaths of four civilians, including a child. It was the first bombing in the city by ISIS in over a year, he said.\n\nShervan Derwish, a spokesman for the Manbij Military Council, said 250 Kurdish fighters had arrived in the ethnically mixed area in just the past few days. He said they came from Deir al-Zour, an Arab-majority city and former Islamic State stronghold in the Euphrates River Valley that is now contested by Russian-backed Syrian government soldiers and the American-backed Arab-Kurdish coalition.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, our fighters who joined the rest of S.D.F. on the front lines with ISIS in Deir al-Zour had to retreat to Manbij upon hearing the Turkish threats of attacking us here, doing ISIS a favor,\u201d Mr. Derwish said. The military council is a Kurdish-led component of the Syrian Democratic Forces in Manbij.\n\nAs late as Feb. 8, there were still S.D.F. forces in Deir al-Zour, according to the coalition, which bombed pro-Syrian regime forces who had attacked an S.D.F. base and its American advisers there. The airstrikes, it later turned out, killed dozens of Russian mercenaries in the process, American officials said.\n\nSome analysts, including Ms. Cafarella, have assessed that the Russian-backed attackers gave the Kurdish fighters safe transit to Afrin across government-controlled territory and exploited their departure to strike the less experienced Arab partners in the S.D.F.\n\nAgid Ahmed, commander of the Northern Sun battalion of the Manbij council, said he and his fighters were ordered to return from the front lines in Deir al-Zour on Feb. 6. That, in turn, freed up other S.D.F. fighters defending Manbij to reinforce Afrin. Mr. Ahmed fought with American forces in 10 offensives in northern and eastern Syria, including retaking of Raqqa from the Islamic State.\n\nSome of the S.D.F. and Manbij council leaders expressed disappointment with American forces for not preventing last month\u2019s Turkish attack on Afrin.\n\n\u201cAmericans on the ground do a good job and we learned a lot from them, data sharing, GPS techniques, but politically we\u2019re not very sure about them. Especially since the situation in Afrin,\u201d said Maher Al Ony, who has four Manbij council brigades \u2014 about 2,500 fighters \u2014 under his command. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect the coalition would allow the Turks to attack Afrin.\u201d\n\nMuhammed Abu Adel, the Manbij council\u2019s top commander, insisted the commitment to fight the Islamic State remains strong, even as his forces have left Deir al-Zour.\n\n\u201cWe sacrificed thousands of lives of our soldiers, we sacrificed so many to finish ISIS,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now this, while fighting the most terrible terrorist group, and suddenly there is a state member of NATO come to fight you.\u201d\n\nEric Schmitt reported from Washington and Rod Nordland from Manbij, Syria.

Its initial release includes breakdowns of how individual companies will allocate their tax savings, based on their public statements and disclosures.\n\nPaul Tudor Jones, a hedge fund titan who is a co-founder of Just Capital, said he hopes publication of that data will lead to a dialogue among executives and the general public \u201cabout what\u2019s the most equitable way to distribute this windfall we just received.\u201d By the middle of the year, he added, the group should have enough information from public disclosures and survey responses to get a fuller understanding of where the money is actually headed. \u201cWe\u2019ll learn a lot,\u201d he said.\n\nThe group\u2019s initial findings suggest shareholders of 90 large corporations \u2014 including Home Depot, Pfizer and Capital One \u2014 are reaping far more of the benefits of the law than workers or consumers. Pay or benefit increases for workers account for 6 percent of the savings those companies report from the law, the group calculates, while job creation accounts for 22 percent. More than half of the money going directly to workers takes the form of one-time bonuses, as opposed to permanent raises or benefits.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Trump tweeted an article about it after it reached 100 companies. The influential Drudge Report linked to it for a day on its home page. Tips poured in, about bosses passing out bonus checks in break rooms or posting about them on company bulletin boards. A 19-year-old fan of the law emails Mr. Kartch frequently with any bonus news he can find.

In early December, researchers in the office of Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, began tracking another slice: the surge in stock buybacks that has accompanied the law. The team scours earnings calls, Google and social media for buyback announcements, and frequently blasts the results out to reporters. Mr. Schumer has taken to denouncing the buyback increases regularly on the Senate floor.\n\nOutside groups are compiling a much broader array of data on what companies plan to do with their savings. Morgan Stanley has surveyed its stock analysts over their expectations of how companies they cover will spend their tax savings. Last week, its researchers released a 23-page report, counting appendixes, that contends stock traders may be overvaluing some companies by underestimating how much of their tax savings they will invest in workers and operations, as opposed to passing on to shareholders.\n\nJust Capital is hoping to round out the picture further, by pushing companies that have not disclosed their tax windfall plans to answer 11 questions \u2014 including spelling out how much of the savings they will put toward raising workers\u2019 compensation, lowering consumer prices and minimizing environmental impact.

Image A protester in Los Angeles last year. This year, political leaders in California are weighing options for replacing the individual health mandate that was eliminated by Republicans. Credit David Mcnew/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\n\nLittle by little, the Trump administration is dismantling elements of the Affordable Care Act and creating a health care system that looks more like the one that preceded it. But some states don\u2019t want to go back and are working to build it back up.\n\nCongress and the Trump administration have reduced Obamacare outreach, weakened benefit requirements, repealed the unpopular individual insurance mandate and broadened opportunities for insurers to offer inexpensive but skimpy plans to more customers.\n\nLast week, the administration released its latest proposal along these lines, by changing the definition of so-called short-term plans. These plans don\u2019t need to follow any of the Obamacare requirements, including popular rules that plans include a standard set of benefits, or cover people with pre-existing conditions. If the rule becomes final, these plans could go from short term to lasting nearly a year or longer.\n\nTaken together, experts say, the administration\u2019s actions will tend to increase the price of health insurance that follows all the Affordable Care Act\u2019s rules and increase the popularity of health plans that cover fewer services. The result could be divided markets, where healthier people buy lightly regulated plans that don\u2019t cover much health care, lower earners get highly subsidized Obamacare \u2014 and sicker middle-class people face escalating costs for insurance with comprehensive benefits.\n\nBut not everywhere. Several states are considering whether to adopt their own versions of the individual mandate, Obamacare\u2019s rule that people who can afford insurance should pay a fine if they don\u2019t obtain it. A few are looking to tighten rules for short-term health plans. Some states are investing heavily on Obamacare outreach and marketing, even as the federal government cuts back.\n\nThe result is likely to be big differences in health insurance options and coverage, depending on where you live. States that lean into the changes might have more health insurance offerings with small price tags, but ones that are inaccessible to people with health problems and don\u2019t cover major health services, like prescription drugs. States pushing back may see more robust Obamacare markets of highly regulated plans, but the price of those plans is likely to remain higher.\n\nLegislation to replace the individual mandate has already been introduced in Maryland and New Jersey with prominent sponsors. Political leaders in other states, including California, Washington, Rhode Island, Vermont, Connecticut as well as the District of Columbia, are weighing options for replacing the mandate this year, as Stephanie Armour reported in The Wall Street Journal. The mandate was designed to give healthier people an incentive to buy insurance before they fell ill, lowering the cost of insurance for everyone who buys it.\n\n\u201cClearly, I think the federal administration and Congress are moving in one direction,\u201d said Brian Feldman, a Maryland state senator who leads the state health subcommittee and was the primary sponsor of mandate legislation there. \u201cAnd I think states like Maryland would like to move in a different direction.\u201d\n\nMr. Feldman and his colleagues aren\u2019t planning simply to replicate the federal individual mandate. Instead, they are trying a new strategy. People who fail to obtain insurance would still be charged a fine, but they would be allowed to use that money as a \u201cdown payment\u201d on a health plan if they wished. Legislators estimate that many people subject to the penalty would not owe anything more to buy health insurance, after federal tax credits are applied.\n\nOther states are hoping to mimic the expiring federal policy more closely. The board governing the insurance marketplace for the District of Columbia voted last week to recommend the adoption of an individual mandate replacement. Connecticut\u2019s governor, Dannel Malloy, is considering a proposal by a Yale health economist.\n\nThose plans are more similar to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s approach, in part for expedience. The federal mandate is set to expire next year, and insurance companies need to develop their health plans and submit 2019 prices by this summer.\n\n\u201cThe idea that a state would be able to stand up something, and put out any guidance, and advise stakeholders, and be able to do it by 2019, is pretty infeasible,\u201d said Jason Levitis, a former Obama administration Treasury Department official who has developed legislation to help states draft mandate replacement bills.\n\nImposing state-level versions of the mandate may be a political challenge even in blue states. But other strategies are in play, too. California is one of a handful of states considering a bill that would effectively ban the short-term insurance plans proposed by the Trump administration. (New York, New Jersey and Rhode Island already effectively block them.)\n\nA number of states across the political spectrum are also considering policies that would provide so-called reinsurance funds, to help protect health insurers from rare, very expensive patients, and help them lower the prices for everyone else.\n\nAlaska, Minnesota and Oregon have already adopted such plans. Washington, New Jersey, Maine, Colorado, Wisconsin and Maryland are working on proposals. Heather Howard, who directs the state health and values strategies program at Princeton University, said that reinsurance plans operated more like a \u201ccarrot\u201d in stabilizing insurance markets. They may prove appealing to a broader array of states, while the mandate, a \u201cstick,\u201d may interest politicians only in the most liberal places.\n\nSome Obamacare-averse states are pursuing policies meant to circumvent the health law\u2019s rules for insurance, and broaden options for cheaper, lightly regulated health plans. Idaho has announced a plan to allow insurers to offer health plans that don\u2019t comply with many of Obamacare\u2019s core rules, and one insurer, Blue Cross of Idaho, has said it will begin selling such plans next month.\n\nAlex Azar, the Health and Human Services secretary, has been cagey about whether he will step in to enforce federal law forbidding such products. Meanwhile, the Iowa legislature is considering a bill that would allow a different type of health plan to circumvent Obamacare rules, as The Des Moines Register recently reported. Medica, the only insurer currently offering Obamacare plans, said it might depart the Iowa market if the plan were approved.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was drafted with room for state customization, but one of its primary goals was to make health insurance around the country more uniform. Thanks to state resistance to the health law, varying local conditions and a Supreme Court decision that made the Medicaid expansion optional, results have been much more uneven. Some states have seen much bigger reductions in the share of the uninsured than others. Only some states have seen insurance premiums stabilize.\n\n\u201cWithout question I think we\u2019re going to see a natural experiment in the states and a growing divergence in outcomes,\u201d said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University\u2019s Health Policy Institute.\n\nEvidence of that divergence is already here. This year, signups for Affordable Care Act health plans were nearly flat compared with last year, despite huge cuts in federal outreach and advertisement. But states that ran their marketplaces and spent heavily on advertising saw stronger signups, while states that were more resistant to the health law experienced drops. The loss of the mandate, and the proliferation of health plans that don\u2019t follow Obamacare\u2019s rules, are likely to widen those gulfs.\n\nMargot Sanger-Katz is a domestic correspondent and writes about health care for The Upshot.

For the latest updates and further coverage, read here.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Hope Hicks, the White House communications director, told House investigators on Tuesday that her work for President Trump, who has a reputation for exaggerations and outright falsehoods, had occasionally required her to tell white lies.\n\nBut after extended consultation with her lawyers, she insisted that she had not lied about matters material to the investigations into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible links to Trump associates, according to three people familiar with her testimony.\n\nVideo One of President Trump\u2019s longest-serving advisers said Wednesday she plans to leave the White House. It came a day after she testified for eight hours before the House Intelligence Committee, and said that as part of her job she occasionally told \u201cwhite lies.\u201d\n\nThe exchange came during more than eight hours of private testimony before the House Intelligence Committee. Ms. Hicks declined to answer similar questions about other figures from the Trump campaign or the White House.\n\nShe also pointedly and repeatedly declined to answer questions about the presidential transition or her time in the White House, lawmakers who sat in on the testimony said, telling investigators that she had been asked by the White House to discuss only her time on the campaign. They added that she did not formally invoke executive privilege.\n\nA lawyer for Ms. Hicks declined to comment.\n\nThe committee, which has been investigating Russia\u2019s meddling for nearly a year, has increasingly found itself butting up against the White House over similar claims by witnesses.\n\nWhen Stephen K. Bannon, who served as Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist until he was forced out in August, similarly refused to testify about his work for the presidential transition team and the White House, Republicans on the committee quickly subpoenaed him. Mr. Bannon continued to refuse to talk about those subjects, and lawmakers are weighing whether to initiate contempt proceedings.\n\nThere was no indication that Republicans would subpoena Ms. Hicks.\n\nRepresentative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the committee, said Republicans were applying a double standard to Mr. Bannon \u2014 who has been exiled from Mr. Trump\u2019s circles after disparaging the Trump children in a book by the author Michael Wolff \u2014 and all other witnesses. He urged Republicans who control the committee to subpoena Ms. Hicks.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an overly broad claim of privilege that I don\u2019t think any court of law would sustain. And I think the White House knows that,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cThis is not executive privilege, it is executive stonewalling.\u201d\n\nMembers of the committee said that under pressure from lawmakers, Ms. Hicks and her lawyers had consulted the White House during the interview and determined that she could answer limited questions about her work on the transition.\n\nStill, Mr. Schiff said that important questions had been left unaddressed.\n\nA fixture of Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle throughout the campaign and in the White House, Ms. Hicks is viewed as a valuable witness by investigators. She was involved in the firing of James B. Comey as F.B.I. director in May and the drafting of a statement in July in response to questions about a 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between Russians and top Trump campaign officials. The statement and its drafting have attracted the interest of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.\n\nMs. Hicks refused to answer questions about both, lawmakers said.\n\nInvestigators working for Mr. Mueller interviewed Ms. Hicks over two days in December. She has also testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nThe interview was the committee\u2019s first in more than a month.

Be it saber-rattling in the South China Sea, proselytizing on American college campuses, theft of corporate secrets or censorship of the web, China has alienated one constituency after another in the United States.\n\n\u201cThe military is gone, the press is gone, the intellectuals are gone, civil society is gone and now the businessmen are gone,\u201d said Mr. Schell, who arranged the dinner for Mr. Bannon and has deep ties to China. \u201cIf you\u2019re taking the long view, you\u2019d have to say we\u2019re on diverging pathways.\u201d\n\nBeyond a general spike in tensions, however, the results of this widening divide are difficult to predict, experts and former officials said, because it is occurring against a backdrop of uncertainty in Beijing and Washington.\n\nMr. Xi\u2019s ascension, experts said, reflects not only his formidable power but also China\u2019s economic instability. Markets were rattled by news last week that the Chinese government seized the Anbang Insurance Group, a debt-ridden conglomerate that owns the Waldorf Astoria hotel and once negotiated to invest in a Manhattan skyscraper owned by the family of the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s handling of China reflects not only his protectionist trade agenda and America First foreign policy, but also his reluctance to antagonize Mr. Xi personally \u2014 a peculiar deference that prompted the tough questions directed at Mr. Bannon over dinner.\n\nFor all his thunderous criticism of China as an economic predator, Mr. Trump has yet to impose a sweeping trade sanction against it. He declined to label China a currency manipulator last year because he said the timing was bad: Mr. Xi had agreed to help the United States press North Korea to curb its nuclear and missile programs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cChina, we probably lost $504 billion, last year, on trade,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Monday at a meeting with governors, a day after Mr. Xi\u2019s bid to lead indefinitely became public. But he added: \u201cI think that President Xi is unique. He\u2019s helping us with North Korea.\u201d\n\nStrongman on the Rise\n\nThe White House is preparing tariffs on steel and aluminum that would target China and other exporters. It has conducted an investigation into China\u2019s theft of intellectual property, which could result in restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States and retaliatory measures against its consumer electronics products.\n\nDomestic politics, in a year of midterm elections, may drive Mr. Trump to take a harder line. Democrats, who are historically closer to Mr. Trump on trade than most Republicans, have signaled that they will use the president\u2019s tough-on-China stance against him if he does not act soon.\n\n\u201cNow that it\u2019s clear that President Xi isn\u2019t going anywhere, getting tough on China is even more of an imperative,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \u201cIf President Trump and Congress don\u2019t crack down on their rapacious trade practices,\u201d he added, \u201cChina will continue eating our lunch for years to come.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But after years of struggling to break into the Chinese markets, suffering the theft of their corporate secrets, many American companies are exhausted.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re hearing businesses that work in China use words like reciprocity and retaliation far more than you ever have,\u201d said Scott Mulhauser, a former chief of staff at the American Embassy in Beijing. \u201cFolks are increasingly frustrated and wrestling with how best to deal with it.\u201d\n\nThe frustration is not across the board: Manufacturers tend to be more fed up than Wall Street, which continues to do lucrative investment-banking business with the Chinese government. Technology companies have soured on China, though the market is so vast that they are still willing to consider concessions they would make nowhere else in the world.\n\nThe Trump administration reflects those fissures. Advisers like Gary D. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who both worked at Goldman Sachs, have persuaded Mr. Trump to hold off on tough trade measures against China in the past.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut there are signs that the White House\u2019s nationalist wing is ascendant. Peter Navarro, an economist whose books include \u201cDeath by China\u201d and \u201cThe Coming China Wars,\u201d is to be promoted, and his ideas seem again in vogue with the president.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn the issue of national security, the administration enshrined a harsher stance toward China in the president\u2019s National Security Strategy. The report characterized China in Cold War-like terms, as a revisionist power that will try \u201cto erode American security and prosperity.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s influence on bastions of higher education has also come under scrutiny. The director of the F.B.I., Christopher A. Wray, testified recently that he believed universities were underestimating the ability of Chinese students to collect valuable national security intelligence. He expressed concern about the Confucius Institute, a global learning network sponsored by the Chinese government, whose expansion has elicited criticism over whether it is a tool to influence public opinion about China.\n\nBy itself, some former officials said, Mr. Xi\u2019s move to stay in power should not augur greater conflict with the United States. He is expected to elevate Wang Qishan to vice president and give him a major role in managing the relationship. And he dispatched a senior economic adviser, Liu He, to Washington this week to meet with the administration. Both men are respected in the United States.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s something inherent in dictatorships and one-man rule that causes clashes with U.S. interests, other than, of course, the conflict in values,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Bader, a former China adviser to President Barack Obama.\n\nFor some China hands, the wave of disillusionment reflects unrealistic hopes about how much China was ever going to converge with the United States. John L. Thornton, a former Goldman Sachs president who has taught at Tsinghua University in Beijing, said that in a chaotic world, the two countries should focus on what unites, rather than what divides, them.\n\n\u201cAt one end of the spectrum is order and at the other end is disorder,\u201d Mr. Thornton said. \u201cChina and the United States are clearly on the same end of the spectrum.\u201d", "keywords": ["tightens", "president", "trade", "xi", "sees", "mr", "conflict", "chinese", "united", "grip", "trump", "gone", "china", "ahead", "states"], "polarity": 0.019759512830165013, "subjectivity": 0.3198749921576008},

He plans to tell American officials about areas where the Chinese economy will be opening up and push for an official commitment to restore economic meetings between the two countries, which stalled after a falling-out over trade in July.\n\nMr. Liu was scheduled to meet with a handful of top executives from American companies and organizations on Wednesday, including Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase; Laurence D. Fink of BlackRock; David M. Solomon of Goldman Sachs; Marc Allen of Boeing; Evan Greenberg of Chubb; Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary; and Thomas J.

But some of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers believe the Chinese used these dialogues not for meaningful exchanges, but simply to stall American objectives as China\u2019s economic power grows.\n\nThe view underlines a broader shift in the United States strategy toward China from using some carrots to a reliance purely on sticks. Mr. Trump has already jettisoned the primary tool that the Obama administration had been using to encourage China to reform \u2014 the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The multicountry deal did not include China, but its members said Beijing would be allowed to join after making significant reforms.\n\nSuspicion of China has only grown in recent months. Mr. Trump\u2019s aides are united around the prospect of trade measures against China, though they differ on how to tailor those measures so as not to hurt American consumers. In addition, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have introduced legislation that would crack down on Chinese investments in the United States that could pose a security risk.\n\nThe Trump administration has introduced tariffs on washing machines and solar cells and modules that are aimed at China, and it is soon expected to announce new restrictions on imported aluminum and steel.\n\nIn its 2018 trade policy agenda released Wednesday, the Trump administration criticized China for undermining market competition and distorting markets, behavior it said had left the world poorer overall.\n\n\u201cCountries that refuse to give us reciprocal treatment or who engage in other unfair trading practices will find that we know how to defend our interests,\u201d the report said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe last few months have been marked by uncertainty, with China experts and Washington trade lawyers expecting tough measures on China to be issued at any time. In return, China has floated retaliation on United States exports of airplanes, sorghum and soybeans.\n\nEconomists say China has fulfilled some of the promises it made to open its economy when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. But under Mr. Xi\u2019s guidance, the country has slowed and even reversed some reforms that would reduce the government\u2019s control over the market, tracking by the Asia Society Policy Institute and the Rhodium Group shows.\n\nAmid this retrenchment, business leaders, policymakers and academics who have long defended China against more hawkish views are suddenly changing their tune.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that post-financial crisis, China\u2019s policies and practices have made it more difficult for foreign investors in some sectors of the economy to compete on a level playing field,\u201d said Myron Brilliant, executive vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThere is a frustration that has been boiling over in recent years that the dialogues have not produced enough tangible results.\u201d\n\nAlthough he stands firmly behind Mr. Xi, the Harvard-educated Mr. Liu has a history of advocating economic reform and more open markets. Mr. Liu is widely thought to be in line for a promotion as China holds a high-profile gathering of top leaders in the coming weeks, potentially to the position of vice premier or to lead the central bank.\n\nExperts on China said Mr. Liu was a familiar figure in the United States, and well-respected by American officials.

Among them was the Pentagon\u2019s limited ability to evacuate injured troops from the Korean Peninsula daily \u2014 a problem more acute if the North retaliated with chemical weapons, according to more than a half-dozen military and Defense Department officials familiar with the exercise.\n\nLarge numbers of surveillance aircraft would have to be moved from the Middle East and Africa to the Pacific to support ground troops. Planners also looked at how American forces stationed in South Korea and Japan would be involved.\n\nPentagon officials cautioned that the planning does not mean that a decision has been made to go to war over President Trump\u2019s demands that North Korea rein in its nuclear ambitions.\n\nA war with North Korea, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has said, would be \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d He and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have argued forcefully for using diplomacy to address Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nCommanders who attended the exercise in Hawaii were told that roughly 10,000 Americans could be wounded in combat in the opening days alone. And the number of civilian casualties, the generals were told, would likely be in the thousands or even hundreds of thousands.\n\nThe potential human costs of a war were so high that, at one point during the exercise, General Milley remarked that \u201cthe brutality of this will be beyond the experience of any living soldier,\u201d according to officials who were involved.\n\nSo, too, would be the sheer logistical enterprise of moving thousands of American soldiers and equipment to the Korean Peninsula. Moreover, senior military officials worry that after 17 years in Afghanistan and Iraq, American troops have become far more used to counterinsurgency fighting than a land war against a state, as an attack on North Korea would likely bring.\n\nBut Mr. Mattis also has ordered top Pentagon leaders to be ready for any possible military action against North Korea. Already, ammunition has been pre-staged in the Pacific region for ground units.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump\u2019s words \u2014 \u201cMilitary solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely,\u201d he said in an August post on Twitter \u2014 have left senior officers and rank-and-file troops convinced that they need to accelerate their contingency planning.\n\nA White House decision to attack is almost wholly dependent on cooperation from South Korea \u2014 not only in committing its troops or other assets to the battle but also accepting the risk of widespread bloodshed on its civilian population if the North fires back.\n\nWith a revival recently signaled on the long-dormant diplomatic track to resolve the Korean crisis, Pentagon officials said they did not want to disrupt any chance for a negotiated resolution. North Korea\u2019s declaration at the end of the Winter Olympics that it was willing to open a dialogue with the United States offered a small amount of hope that the political pageantry of the Games would lead to more substantial results.\n\nImage United States Marines at a military camp in Afghanistan this year.

Credit Massoud Hossaini/Associated Press\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s response that the United States, too, was interested in talking compounded that hope. \u201cWe want to talk also,\u201d Mr. Trump said earlier this week, but \u201conly under the right conditions.\u201d\n\nBut Trump administration officials still insist that the United States will not sit with North Korea unless Pyongyang agrees to open negotiations on its nuclear program, a condition the North has rejected.\n\nAnd so the planning continues.\n\nMr. Mattis and other senior military leaders fear that a stray incident could spark a sudden conflict with the North. Of particular concern is the \u201cladder of escalation\u201d \u2014 a chain of actions prompted by the shooting down of a North Korean or American jet, or sinking of a ship of which Mr. Mattis and other Pentagon leaders could quickly lose control.\n\nHarsh new sanctions that the Trump administration announced last week are a prime example.\n\nThe economic penalties target 28 ships that are registered in China and seven other countries, and intend to further cut off North Korea\u2019s imports of oil and exports of coal. But by going after the shipments, the United States is edging closer to the imposition of an economic blockade on the North.\n\nWhile Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stopped short of saying the United States Navy would forcibly board ships on the high seas, administration officials privately have said that sailors may yet be called upon to do so, if hostile foreign vessels are suspected of transporting certain material to North Korea.\n\nThat, Defense Department officials say, could easily spark an incident that could escalate.\n\nMr. Trump recently referred to another type of incident that American officials fear could spark a war.\n\nDuring a speech in Seoul last year, he brought up North Korea\u2019s 1969 downing an American spy plane that had been flying over the Sea of Japan. All 31 Americans aboard were killed in the attack by two North Korean MiGs.\n\nAt the time, President Richard M. Nixon chose not to retaliate. It is unclear if Mr. Trump would follow the same course; in bringing up the episode last year, he warned, \u201cDo not underestimate us, and do not try us.\u201d\n\nThe Hawaii planning exercise looked at a wide range of military capabilities and missions. They included:\n\n\u25a0 How many conventional and Special Operations forces could be deployed, in phases, to target North Korean nuclear sites.\n\n\u25a0 Whether the Army\u2019s 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions could be charged with fighting in tunnels.\n\n\u25a0 Exhaustive plans to take down North Korea\u2019s integrated air defenses, allowing American manned and unmanned aircraft into the reclusive country.\n\n\u25a0 Plans for the morbid but necessary details of personnel recovery plans, such as if pilots are shot down, and the evacuation of the dead and wounded.\n\nIn a meeting on Monday in \u201cthe Tank\u201d \u2014 a secured space in the Pentagon where the Joint Chiefs of Staff discuss top-secret issues \u2014 General Milley told senior military leaders about the exercise but did not outline details of the war plans, officials said. The Army holds around eight tabletop exercises every year for different countries and scenarios.\n\nIn April, a larger meeting is being planned between Mr. Mattis and the global combatant commanders. It is one of the periodic meetings that Mr. Mattis has with the top military brass, but is expected to heavily focus on North Korea.\n\nSpecial Operations forces have been briefed on some details of a plan that is separate but related to a potential strike on North Korea, officials said. However, Special Operations forces have yet to change course from their current operations.\n\nAlthough the planning is continuing apace, a military operation against North Korea has yet to be given a formal name. Special Operations units, however, have already been assigned to specific task forces with names such as Trident and Falcon.\n\nOrder Reprints | Today\u2019s Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A 11 of the New York edition with the headline: U.S. Advances Military Plans for North Korea\n\n\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["korea", "war", "moves", "exercise", "military", "plans", "officials", "mr", "korean", "banks", "north", "american", "troops", "ahead", "diplomacy"], "polarity": 0.06786775399080089, "subjectivity": 0.37126428909632037},

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/business/economy/bitcoin-electricity-productivity.html", "text": "Advertisement\n\nIs Bitcoin a Waste of Electricity, or Something Worse? Image Tom Pillsworth, right, whose company operates and maintains Bitcoin machines located at a former paper warehouse in Plattsburgh, N.Y. Credit Jacob Hannah for The New York Times\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A manufacturing start-up recently announced plans to move into a shuttered aluminum factory in upstate New York, taking advantage of abundant cheap electricity from the St. Lawrence River.\n\nInstead of smelting aluminum, however, the company plans to turn that power into Bitcoins.\n\nMoney is supposed to be a means of buying things. Now, the nation\u2019s hottest investment is buying money. And the investment rush is raising questions about whether one reason for the slow pace of economic growth in recent years is that the nation is busy distracting itself. While Bitcoin mining may not be labor intensive, it diverts time, energy and capital from other, more productive activities that economists say could fuel faster growth.\n\n\u201cIt appears that much of our evolving digital infrastructure is devoted to activities, like the proliferation of cybercoins, that are worse than frivolous,\u201d said James McAndrews, the former head of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nBy a wide range of measures, America has a productivity problem. The economy is growing slowly, and almost 20 percent of adults in their prime working years are neither working nor trying to find work. Americans who do have jobs are less likely to start their own companies. Even the most basic kind of production is in decline. Americans are having less sex and making fewer babies.\n\nImage Tom Pillsworth sets up equipment at the Bitcoin mining facility in Plattsburgh, N.Y. Credit Jacob Hannah for The New York Times\n\nSome economists see evidence that people are playing video games instead of going to work, logging on instead of getting it on, and plowing a growing share of their time, capital and natural resources into virtual products like social media, games and the latest fad: virtual currencies.\n\nBitcoin, the largest virtual currency, is a particularly voracious consumer of resources because new Bitcoins are distributed in a kind of lottery where each ticket is purchased with electricity.\n\nBitcoin miners compete for the coins by submitting answers to difficult math problems. Instead of solving the problems, miners use computers to submit a flood of guesses. This can be lucrative: Each Bitcoin is currently valued at about $10,550.\n\nBelievers insist it is a worthwhile endeavor. They describe Bitcoin as a superior currency that will eventually come into wide use, and they predict even broader applications for blockchains, the digital bookkeeping method used to record ownership of Bitcoins and to verify transactions.\n\nBut Bitcoin remains so hard to use that a major Bitcoin conference in January had to stop accepting Bitcoin. It is, in practice, a speculative investment, like gold. And Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University, said mining gold was a better use of resources, because even if it lost value, it could be used to fill teeth.\n\n\u201cOnce the Bitcoin power is burned, it is never coming back,\u201d he said.\n\nColin L. Read, the mayor of Plattsburgh, N.Y., also sees it as a public nuisance. The city was guaranteed a fixed supply of cheap electricity as part of the construction of power-generating dams on the St. Lawrence in the 1950s. Bitcoin mining companies are plugging into that power supply like a swarm of hungry mosquitoes.\n\nMr. Read said that Bitcoin mining now consumes about 10 percent of the city\u2019s power, and that is forcing Plattsburgh to buy a growing amount of extra electricity on the open market, at rates up to 100 times higher than its base cost.\n\nMr. Read, who is also an economics professor, said he would rather sell the city\u2019s supply of cheap power to companies employing large numbers of people. Mold-Rite Plastics, which makes bottle caps, also uses about 10 percent of the city\u2019s power, but it employs about 200 people. The mining companies? \u201cThey hire a security guard,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a guy who comes when something breaks.\u201d\n\nDavid Bowman, who describes himself as Plattsburgh\u2019s first Bitcoin miner \u2014 \u201cI started a long time ago, around 2014,\u201d he said \u2014 started with a handful of computers. Now he has 20 machines.\n\nImage Mold-Rite Plastics, a maker of bottle caps in Plattsburgh, N.Y., uses the same amount of electricity as Bitcoin miners, but employs about 200 people. Credit Jacob Hannah for The New York Times\n\nImage Bitcoin companies have begun moving into space at an old paper mill in Plattsburgh, N.Y. Credit Jacob Hannah for The New York Times\n\nA few years ago, he rented a room in an old paper warehouse, where he runs the specialized hard drives around the clock. They sit side-by-side on wire racks, fans whirring to dissipate the heat. About half a dozen other mining companies have since moved into the same building.\n\nMr. Bowman, who is from Plattsburgh, said he sympathizes with the mayor\u2019s concerns. He is the only employee of his company, and he is presently a full-time medical student on the Caribbean island of Grenada. But Bitcoin mining paid his college tuition and it is paying for medical school.\n\nAnd he doesn\u2019t see that Plattsburgh has better options.\n\n\u201cThe place needs all the jobs they can get,\u201d he said, although his company employs no one beyond him. He does pay fees to an investor-owned company that operates and maintains the machines and has one employee.\n\nOther governments also are grappling with the merits of virtual currencies. Enel, the largest European power company, said earlier this month it would not sell electricity to a virtual miner, citing environmental concerns.\n\n\u201cEnel has undertaken a clear path toward decarbonization and sustainable development and sees the intensive use of energy dedicated to cryptocurrency mining as an unsustainable practice that does not fit with the business model it is pursuing,\u201d the company, partly owned by the Italian government, said in a statement.\n\nSome Bitcoin miners emphasize their reliance on renewable energy, but the energy they use might otherwise be put to other purposes. Consider the example of Quebec, one of the world\u2019s largest producers of hydroelectric power. Local demand has flatlined, leading the province to consider exporting electricity to Massachusetts, which is seeking to increase the share of current power consumption generated by sustainable sources. But Quebec is now weighing that possibility alongside a wave of proposals from mining companies.\n\nImage David Bowman owns a Bitcoin mining company called Plattsburgh BTC in Plattsburgh, N.Y. Credit Luvnish Karnani for The New York Times\n\nSome American utilities, too, are hungry for new customers. Domestic demand for electricity is in decline as power-hungry industries, like aluminum smelting, have moved to other countries and households are increasingly using LED light bulbs.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re thankful that anyone still wants to use energy,\u201d said Robert McCullough of McCullough Research, an Oregon energy consultancy.\n\nAnd plenty of places are hungry for jobs \u2014 even the relatively few jobs that virtual mining brings.\n\nMassena, the town with the shuttered smelter, is about two hours from Plattsburgh. It also enjoys a guaranteed supply of cheap electricity, but it has lost several of its major employers, including the smelter and a General Motors factory.\n\nThe New York Power Authority reserves 490 megawatts of low-cost power for industrial users in Franklin, Jefferson and St. Lawrence counties, the northern tier that includes Massena. The decline of local industry means only 52 percent of that power is currently committed, which is why officials were delighted when a company called Coinmint proposed to install 16,000 computers in the old aluminum building.\n\nThe company, which is still negotiating contracts, told the power authority it would employ 150 people. Employers historically have created 30.5 jobs in exchange for each megawatt of low-cost electricity, according to the power authority, while Coinmint is proposing to create just new 10 jobs per megawatt. But 10 is more than none.\n\n\u201cThe plan is to get anybody here that you can,\u201d said Steven D. O\u2019Shaughnessy, Massena\u2019s town supervisor. \u201cI have said all along, I\u2019ll take whatever I can.\u201d\n\nImage The mayor of Plattsburgh, N.Y., Colin L.

They have responded by spending tens of millions of dollars to combat consumers\u2019 efforts to untether themselves from the electric grid.\n\nA new study by the Sustainable Investments Institute, a nonprofit group that conducts research on efforts to influence corporate boards, found that utilities had spent $50 million between 2011 and 2016 to block clean energy in seven states: Alaska, California, Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon and Washington.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDespite calling itself the Sunshine State, Florida lags behind states like New York and New Jersey in residential solar installations. But a 2016 campaign resulted in overwhelming voter approval of a constitutional amendment to provide a property tax exemption for solar installations. In a referendum months later, voters rejected a utility-backed measure, presented as pro-solar, that would have actually allowed new fees on home solar users.\n\nDifferent Directions on Solar Energy Republican-leaning states lag in residential solar capacity, though some of those states are among the leaders in large solar-power projects by utility companies.

When Mr. Trump was planning his campaign in spring 2015, he told Ms. Hicks he was pulling her from Ms. Trump\u2019s team to put her on his small political staff despite her lack of experience.\n\nBut the Trump family trusted her, and that was a crucial factor in her emergence as a key aide to the president, who also valued her loyalty.\n\nYet as the person who spent the most time with Mr. Trump, Ms. Hicks became enmeshed in a number of controversies over the past year, including key aspects of the investigations by Congress and the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into possible collusion between the Russian government and the Trump campaign, as well as the firing of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey.\n\nIn recent weeks, her personal life drew unwanted attention when it was reported that she had dated Rob Porter, the White House staff secretary who resigned under pressure over allegations that he had abused his two former wives.\n\nMultiple White House aides said Ms. Hicks\u2019s decision to leave was unrelated to her appearance before the House committee.

She also had the ability to stop Mr. Trump from focusing on an issue he was angry about, and sometimes shield other members of the staff from Mr. Trump\u2019s anger.\n\nWhile Ms. Hicks and Mr. Kelly developed a functional, respectful relationship, he considered her access to the president to be a challenge to the command-and-control system he tried to enforce, according to several White House aides.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

She maintained one of the lowest public profiles of anyone to ever hold the job, declining to sit for interviews or appear on the podium in the White House briefing room.\n\nEven those in the West Wing who did not like her approach feared her power, and worried about crossing her. But some former Trump advisers sounded hopeful that a new staff configuration might create a more consistent approach to governing, in contrast to the way the White House has functioned for the past year, when people close to the president could easily influence him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOther advisers said they were more concerned that Mr. Trump, who has found the White House isolating, would struggle with no close campaign aides nearby.\n\nDan Scavino Jr., the White House digital director, is the only member of the president\u2019s original campaign team still working directly for Mr. Trump. Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Melania Trump, was an early campaign press aide, and the president is fond of her, raising the possibility she could play a role with the West Wing press office.\n\nIt was not immediately clear who will fill Ms. Hicks\u2019s role, although several White House officials and external advisers said they expect that Mercedes Schlapp \u2014 who Mr. Kelly brought in and who was seen by some as a ballast against Ms. Hicks\u2019s influence when he took over the job \u2014 will be elevated in some way.\n\nMs. Hicks had been considering leaving the White House for several months.

He urged backers of a renewed ban on assault weapons to make their case to the authors of the legislation and said he would welcome the opportunity to enact one sweeping bill to combat mass shootings.

On Feb. 11, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis called the development \u201ca distraction\u201d and said it was \u201cnot a significant number right now.\u201d\n\nMaj. Gen. Jamie Jarrard, the Special Operations commander for the American-led coalition in Iraq and Syria, said in an interview in early February that the elimination of the entire caliphate was \u201cvery close.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything that disrupts us or takes our eye off that prize is not good,\u201d General Jarrard said.\n\nMr. Mattis, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the White House national security adviser, all have met with Turkish officials in recent days to seek an end to the clashes with Kurdish militia in northwest Syria and prevent the fighting from spreading.\n\nBut by last week, Heather Nauert, the State Department\u2019s spokeswoman, acknowledged to reporters on Feb. 22 that \u201cwe can no longer fight ISIS the way that we would fully like to be able to do.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe diversion of Kurdish fighters and lower-level commanders, who play a pivotal role in directing battlefield operations against the Islamic State, has increased from a trickle to a torrent, according to five American military officials who are monitoring the situation and spoke on condition of anonymity.

As of two weeks ago, Kurdish officials said more than 20,000 Kurdish defenders had rallied to Afrin to confront Turkish troops. That number includes fighters who were already there, as well as newly arrived reinforcements.\n\n\u201cThe Turkish invasion to occupy Afrin has terribly influenced our fight against ISIS,\u201d Shahoz Hasan, co-president of the Syrian Democratic Union party, said in an interview on Monday. \u201cAfter we managed to get ISIS in a choke hold,\u201d he said the Turks \u201care attacking our forces in that region.\u201d\n\nFor many Kurdish militia and their commanders, the call to defend family and friends in Afrin and a Kurdish enclave in the city of Manbij that is also threatened by Turkish troops has taken precedence over what many consider to be an American war against the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cThose fighters find it more urgent to be in their areas on the Syrian-Turkish border rather than on the front lines with ISIS,\u201d said Arin Sheikhmos, a Kurdish journalist based in Qamishli. The city is the de facto capital of Kurdish areas of northern Syria, which the Kurds call Rojava.\n\n\u201cTo them, it is a priority to defend their land rather than liberating others\u2019 land,\u201d Mr. Sheikhmos said.\n\nThe American-led coalition appears to have intensified airstrikes on the Islamic State in areas east of the Euphrates River to fill the battlespace the Kurdish fighters had left, Mr. Sheikhmos said. The approach was not working, he said.\n\nHe said the Islamic State carried out a car bombing in Qamishli a few days ago, resulting in the deaths of four civilians, including a child. It was the first bombing in the city by ISIS in over a year, he said.\n\nShervan Derwish, a spokesman for the Manbij Military Council, said 250 Kurdish fighters had arrived in the ethnically mixed area in just the past few days. He said they came from Deir al-Zour, an Arab-majority city and former Islamic State stronghold in the Euphrates River Valley that is now contested by Russian-backed Syrian government soldiers and the American-backed Arab-Kurdish coalition.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, our fighters who joined the rest of S.D.F. on the front lines with ISIS in Deir al-Zour had to retreat to Manbij upon hearing the Turkish threats of attacking us here, doing ISIS a favor,\u201d Mr. Derwish said. The military council is a Kurdish-led component of the Syrian Democratic Forces in Manbij.\n\nAs late as Feb. 8, there were still S.D.F. forces in Deir al-Zour, according to the coalition, which bombed pro-Syrian regime forces who had attacked an S.D.F. base and its American advisers there. The airstrikes, it later turned out, killed dozens of Russian mercenaries in the process, American officials said.\n\nSome analysts, including Ms. Cafarella, have assessed that the Russian-backed attackers gave the Kurdish fighters safe transit to Afrin across government-controlled territory and exploited their departure to strike the less experienced Arab partners in the S.D.F.\n\nAgid Ahmed, commander of the Northern Sun battalion of the Manbij council, said he and his fighters were ordered to return from the front lines in Deir al-Zour on Feb. 6. That, in turn, freed up other S.D.F. fighters defending Manbij to reinforce Afrin. Mr. Ahmed fought with American forces in 10 offensives in northern and eastern Syria, including retaking of Raqqa from the Islamic State.\n\nSome of the S.D.F. and Manbij council leaders expressed disappointment with American forces for not preventing last month\u2019s Turkish attack on Afrin.\n\n\u201cAmericans on the ground do a good job and we learned a lot from them, data sharing, GPS techniques, but politically we\u2019re not very sure about them. Especially since the situation in Afrin,\u201d said Maher Al Ony, who has four Manbij council brigades \u2014 about 2,500 fighters \u2014 under his command. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect the coalition would allow the Turks to attack Afrin.\u201d\n\nMuhammed Abu Adel, the Manbij council\u2019s top commander, insisted the commitment to fight the Islamic State remains strong, even as his forces have left Deir al-Zour.\n\n\u201cWe sacrificed thousands of lives of our soldiers, we sacrificed so many to finish ISIS,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now this, while fighting the most terrible terrorist group, and suddenly there is a state member of NATO come to fight you.\u201d", "keywords": ["turkish", "amid", "state", "away", "fighters", "fight", "officials", "manbij", "syria", "assault", "forces", "drawn", "isis", "kurdish", "islamic", "american"], "polarity": 0.032520257520257494, "subjectivity": 0.35693820068820076},

Mr. Trump tweeted an article about it after it reached 100 companies. The influential Drudge Report linked to it for a day on its home page. Tips poured in, about bosses passing out bonus checks in break rooms or posting about them on company bulletin boards.

Image A protester in Los Angeles last year. This year, political leaders in California are weighing options for replacing the individual health mandate that was eliminated by Republicans. Credit David Mcnew/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\n\nLittle by little, the Trump administration is dismantling elements of the Affordable Care Act and creating a health care system that looks more like the one that preceded it. But some states don\u2019t want to go back and are working to build it back up.\n\nCongress and the Trump administration have reduced Obamacare outreach, weakened benefit requirements, repealed the unpopular individual insurance mandate and broadened opportunities for insurers to offer inexpensive but skimpy plans to more customers.\n\nLast week, the administration released its latest proposal along these lines, by changing the definition of so-called short-term plans. These plans don\u2019t need to follow any of the Obamacare requirements, including popular rules that plans include a standard set of benefits, or cover people with pre-existing conditions. If the rule becomes final, these plans could go from short term to lasting nearly a year or longer.\n\nTaken together, experts say, the administration\u2019s actions will tend to increase the price of health insurance that follows all the Affordable Care Act\u2019s rules and increase the popularity of health plans that cover fewer services. The result could be divided markets, where healthier people buy lightly regulated plans that don\u2019t cover much health care, lower earners get highly subsidized Obamacare \u2014 and sicker middle-class people face escalating costs for insurance with comprehensive benefits.\n\nBut not everywhere. Several states are considering whether to adopt their own versions of the individual mandate, Obamacare\u2019s rule that people who can afford insurance should pay a fine if they don\u2019t obtain it. A few are looking to tighten rules for short-term health plans. Some states are investing heavily on Obamacare outreach and marketing, even as the federal government cuts back.\n\nThe result is likely to be big differences in health insurance options and coverage, depending on where you live. States that lean into the changes might have more health insurance offerings with small price tags, but ones that are inaccessible to people with health problems and don\u2019t cover major health services, like prescription drugs. States pushing back may see more robust Obamacare markets of highly regulated plans, but the price of those plans is likely to remain higher.\n\nLegislation to replace the individual mandate has already been introduced in Maryland and New Jersey with prominent sponsors. Political leaders in other states, including California, Washington, Rhode Island, Vermont, Connecticut as well as the District of Columbia, are weighing options for replacing the mandate this year, as Stephanie Armour reported in The Wall Street Journal. The mandate was designed to give healthier people an incentive to buy insurance before they fell ill, lowering the cost of insurance for everyone who buys it.\n\n\u201cClearly, I think the federal administration and Congress are moving in one direction,\u201d said Brian Feldman, a Maryland state senator who leads the state health subcommittee and was the primary sponsor of mandate legislation there. \u201cAnd I think states like Maryland would like to move in a different direction.\u201d\n\nMr. Feldman and his colleagues aren\u2019t planning simply to replicate the federal individual mandate. Instead, they are trying a new strategy. People who fail to obtain insurance would still be charged a fine, but they would be allowed to use that money as a \u201cdown payment\u201d on a health plan if they wished. Legislators estimate that many people subject to the penalty would not owe anything more to buy health insurance, after federal tax credits are applied.\n\nOther states are hoping to mimic the expiring federal policy more closely. The board governing the insurance marketplace for the District of Columbia voted last week to recommend the adoption of an individual mandate replacement. Connecticut\u2019s governor, Dannel Malloy, is considering a proposal by a Yale health economist.\n\nThose plans are more similar to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s approach, in part for expedience. The federal mandate is set to expire next year, and insurance companies need to develop their health plans and submit 2019 prices by this summer.\n\n\u201cThe idea that a state would be able to stand up something, and put out any guidance, and advise stakeholders, and be able to do it by 2019, is pretty infeasible,\u201d said Jason Levitis, a former Obama administration Treasury Department official who has developed legislation to help states draft mandate replacement bills.\n\nImposing state-level versions of the mandate may be a political challenge even in blue states. But other strategies are in play, too. California is one of a handful of states considering a bill that would effectively ban the short-term insurance plans proposed by the Trump administration. (New York, New Jersey and Rhode Island already effectively block them.)\n\nA number of states across the political spectrum are also considering policies that would provide so-called reinsurance funds, to help protect health insurers from rare, very expensive patients, and help them lower the prices for everyone else.\n\nAlaska, Minnesota and Oregon have already adopted such plans. Washington, New Jersey, Maine, Colorado, Wisconsin and Maryland are working on proposals. Heather Howard, who directs the state health and values strategies program at Princeton University, said that reinsurance plans operated more like a \u201ccarrot\u201d in stabilizing insurance markets. They may prove appealing to a broader array of states, while the mandate, a \u201cstick,\u201d may interest politicians only in the most liberal places.\n\nSome Obamacare-averse states are pursuing policies meant to circumvent the health law\u2019s rules for insurance, and broaden options for cheaper, lightly regulated health plans. Idaho has announced a plan to allow insurers to offer health plans that don\u2019t comply with many of Obamacare\u2019s core rules, and one insurer, Blue Cross of Idaho, has said it will begin selling such plans next month.\n\nAlex Azar, the Health and Human Services secretary, has been cagey about whether he will step in to enforce federal law forbidding such products. Meanwhile, the Iowa legislature is considering a bill that would allow a different type of health plan to circumvent Obamacare rules, as The Des Moines Register recently reported. Medica, the only insurer currently offering Obamacare plans, said it might depart the Iowa market if the plan were approved.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was drafted with room for state customization, but one of its primary goals was to make health insurance around the country more uniform. Thanks to state resistance to the health law, varying local conditions and a Supreme Court decision that made the Medicaid expansion optional, results have been much more uneven. Some states have seen much bigger reductions in the share of the uninsured than others. Only some states have seen insurance premiums stabilize.\n\n\u201cWithout question I think we\u2019re going to see a natural experiment in the states and a growing divergence in outcomes,\u201d said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University\u2019s Health Policy Institute.\n\nEvidence of that divergence is already here. This year, signups for Affordable Care Act health plans were nearly flat compared with last year, despite huge cuts in federal outreach and advertisement. But states that ran their marketplaces and spent heavily on advertising saw stronger signups, while states that were more resistant to the health law experienced drops. The loss of the mandate, and the proliferation of health plans that don\u2019t follow Obamacare\u2019s rules, are likely to widen those gulfs.\n\nMargot Sanger-Katz is a domestic correspondent and writes about health care for The Upshot.

Schell, the director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe disillusionment with China, he said, began setting in long before Mr. Xi cemented his grip on the Politburo. Be it saber-rattling in the South China Sea, proselytizing on American college campuses, theft of corporate secrets or censorship of the web, China has alienated one constituency after another in the United States.\n\n\u201cThe military is gone, the press is gone, the intellectuals are gone, civil society is gone and now the businessmen are gone,\u201d said Mr. Schell, who arranged the dinner for Mr. Bannon and has deep ties to China. \u201cIf you\u2019re taking the long view, you\u2019d have to say we\u2019re on diverging pathways.\u201d\n\nBeyond a general spike in tensions, however, the results of this widening divide are difficult to predict, experts and former officials said, because it is occurring against a backdrop of uncertainty in Beijing and Washington.\n\nMr. Xi\u2019s ascension, experts said, reflects not only his formidable power but also China\u2019s economic instability. Markets were rattled by news last week that the Chinese government seized the Anbang Insurance Group, a debt-ridden conglomerate that owns the Waldorf Astoria hotel and once negotiated to invest in a Manhattan skyscraper owned by the family of the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s handling of China reflects not only his protectionist trade agenda and America First foreign policy, but also his reluctance to antagonize Mr. Xi personally \u2014 a peculiar deference that prompted the tough questions directed at Mr. Bannon over dinner.\n\nFor all his thunderous criticism of China as an economic predator, Mr. Trump has yet to impose a sweeping trade sanction against it. He declined to label China a currency manipulator last year because he said the timing was bad: Mr. Xi had agreed to help the United States press North Korea to curb its nuclear and missile programs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cChina, we probably lost $504 billion, last year, on trade,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Monday at a meeting with governors, a day after Mr. Xi\u2019s bid to lead indefinitely became public. But he added: \u201cI think that President Xi is unique. He\u2019s helping us with North Korea.\u201d\n\nStrongman on the Rise\n\nThe White House is preparing tariffs on steel and aluminum that would target China and other exporters. It has conducted an investigation into China\u2019s theft of intellectual property, which could result in restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States and retaliatory measures against its consumer electronics products.\n\nDomestic politics, in a year of midterm elections, may drive Mr. Trump to take a harder line. Democrats, who are historically closer to Mr. Trump on trade than most Republicans, have signaled that they will use the president\u2019s tough-on-China stance against him if he does not act soon.\n\n\u201cNow that it\u2019s clear that President Xi isn\u2019t going anywhere, getting tough on China is even more of an imperative,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \u201cIf President Trump and Congress don\u2019t crack down on their rapacious trade practices,\u201d he added, \u201cChina will continue eating our lunch for years to come.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But after years of struggling to break into the Chinese markets, suffering the theft of their corporate secrets, many American companies are exhausted.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re hearing businesses that work in China use words like reciprocity and retaliation far more than you ever have,\u201d said Scott Mulhauser, a former chief of staff at the American Embassy in Beijing. \u201cFolks are increasingly frustrated and wrestling with how best to deal with it.\u201d\n\nThe frustration is not across the board: Manufacturers tend to be more fed up than Wall Street, which continues to do lucrative investment-banking business with the Chinese government. Technology companies have soured on China, though the market is so vast that they are still willing to consider concessions they would make nowhere else in the world.\n\nThe Trump administration reflects those fissures. Advisers like Gary D. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who both worked at Goldman Sachs, have persuaded Mr. Trump to hold off on tough trade measures against China in the past.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut there are signs that the White House\u2019s nationalist wing is ascendant. Peter Navarro, an economist whose books include \u201cDeath by China\u201d and \u201cThe Coming China Wars,\u201d is to be promoted, and his ideas seem again in vogue with the president.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn the issue of national security, the administration enshrined a harsher stance toward China in the president\u2019s National Security Strategy. The report characterized China in Cold War-like terms, as a revisionist power that will try \u201cto erode American security and prosperity.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s influence on bastions of higher education has also come under scrutiny. The director of the F.B.I., Christopher A. Wray, testified recently that he believed universities were underestimating the ability of Chinese students to collect valuable national security intelligence. He expressed concern about the Confucius Institute, a global learning network sponsored by the Chinese government, whose expansion has elicited criticism over whether it is a tool to influence public opinion about China.\n\nBy itself, some former officials said, Mr. Xi\u2019s move to stay in power should not augur greater conflict with the United States. He is expected to elevate Wang Qishan to vice president and give him a major role in managing the relationship. And he dispatched a senior economic adviser, Liu He, to Washington this week to meet with the administration. Both men are respected in the United States.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s something inherent in dictatorships and one-man rule that causes clashes with U.S. interests, other than, of course, the conflict in values,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Bader, a former China adviser to President Barack Obama.\n\nFor some China hands, the wave of disillusionment reflects unrealistic hopes about how much China was ever going to converge with the United States. John L. Thornton, a former Goldman Sachs president who has taught at Tsinghua University in Beijing, said that in a chaotic world, the two countries should focus on what unites, rather than what divides, them.\n\n\u201cAt one end of the spectrum is order and at the other end is disorder,\u201d Mr. Thornton said. \u201cChina and the United States are clearly on the same end of the spectrum.\u201d", "keywords": ["tightens", "president", "trade", "xi", "sees", "mr", "conflict", "chinese", "united", "grip", "trump", "gone", "china", "ahead", "states"], "polarity": 0.019759512830165013, "subjectivity": 0.3198749921576008},

I\u2019d love to jump right in and hear your aspirations for Prairie View. What do you hope to accomplish in your time as president? I assume you had many offers to lead other colleges. Why was Prairie View different?\n\nRuth Simmons: Well, I\u2019m a native of Texas, and one of the things that I did when I returned to Houston after I retired from Brown was think about the ways I could use my experience to help the community. I started with small ventures in the city, but I hadn\u2019t thought really that another university would be in my life. But when I was approached by Prairie View, I thought immediately about its significant impact on my brother, who went there. And what Dillard did for me.\n\nI grew up in a segregated neighborhood in Grapeland, Tex., with very little experience with the world. The transition that Dillard enabled for me was extremely valuable. As an undergraduate, I began to grow a sense of confidence that helped me move from a fairly insular environment to a bigger stage when I went to graduate school.\n\nMy aspirations for Prairie View are to essentially make sure the university is continuing to do the same thing for students today that it did for my brother \u2014 and Dillard did for me. And that is to offer the advantage of a strong education that will prepare students for the careers they want, in a social and cultural context that helps them develop the confidence to perform after graduation.\n\nAs president, that means focusing on time-honored strategies to success that apply to universities everywhere: worrying about the faculty who are recruited here, the campus experience, and whether we are providing the leadership and internship opportunities that students need. It means worrying about the reputation of the university. It\u2019s obviously a much more competitive world today than it was when I was a student, but the underlying work to move the university to a level of achievement that makes students and alumni proud is the same.\n\nM.J.: What do you see as some of the major challenges facing historically black colleges and universities?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: The general challenge for H.B.C.U.s is not unlike the problem many universities face today, and that is the financial model. Being tuition dependent has become a large problem for all universities. H.B.C.U.s are dependent on raising money, but that is a reality that most universities obviously face. So it very much depends on the question of whether the schools have a good-enough foundation because of secure financing. When it comes to the federal government\u2019s role in supporting H.B.C.U.s, I think we don\u2019t yet understand the extent to which they will be affected by the changes in Washington today. To say that many are not hopeful in this moment is an understatement. We just don\u2019t know.\n\nFrankly, that\u2019s why I advocate for developing enough financial independence to secure the future of our institutions. That means looking for different revenue streams, looking to increase our ability to raise funds and finding alternate programs that help to bring more income into our university. The only strategy cannot be to persistently raise tuition, making college outside the reach of many families.\n\nM.J.: You\u2019ve led several institutions that are all very different from each other, and the topic of leadership is something you\u2019ve talked a lot about. In another interview with The Times you said that it\u2019s much easier to lead people \u201cif you convey the underlying principles.\u201d Can you elaborate?\n\nR.S.: One thing that I\u2019ve learned is that the perceptions of what it takes to be a leader are often based on prototypical models that don\u2019t have much truth in reality. People look at the institutions that I have led and they see dissimilarities. I see similarities. When people think in terms of leadership, they\u2019re often thinking about the kind of specific skills needed for different types of enterprises. I think of leadership as more of a disposition \u2014 the ability to step into a situation to learn about the history of the enterprise, the opportunities that it faces, the culture that exists and the people who are served by it. To look at all of that, to listen to stakeholders and then to think about how that enterprise or institution should best be served. There is no one model of leadership if you approach it that way. What I have tried to do wherever I go is to start where the institution is rather than try to import particularly rigid constructs from other places. In that sense, I think a leader is more than anything else a facilitator. A person who is able to come in to show a community a picture of what it is, to provide some insight into what it could be \u2014 how it could be different or improved perhaps \u2014 and then enlist the help of people who are there and others who support that institution in order to move forward together.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nI don\u2019t subscribe to the model of hero leadership, which is identifying somebody who can come in and have magical powers and then wield the wand and fix things that have not been fixable before. I don\u2019t see that. I think leadership is a community affair.\n\nM.J.: That makes sense. So how do you approach educating the current generation of students at Prairie View to lead in the way you described?\n\nR.S.: People today are fond of leadership programs that theorize about the profile and tenets of leadership. And students anxiously get involved in those programs. I rather think that our entire campuses are incubators of leadership even without the formality of such programs because if we\u2019re doing what we should be doing, we are acclimating students to an environment in which they have to learn to work with others who are very different from themselves. And that seems to me to be the first requirement of leadership. To actually learn to work with people in a respectful and inclusive way is inordinately important. A campus provides one of the best opportunities for people to be able to do that because you sit in class alongside people whom you initially don\u2019t know. You are discussing your ideas, having people respond to them and often rejecting what you\u2019re saying. You are joining organizations that have certain aims that are being advanced by the collective, so you\u2019re learning how to facilitate. You are asked to step into leadership roles either through student government or organizations. Even in the classroom context you might play a leadership role. You have to learn to express yourself, to be convincing, to write out your ideas, to be more thoughtful than you\u2019d ordinarily be. All of those things are components of leadership.\n\nM.J.: Some would argue that social media, or perhaps disagreements over the concept of safe spaces, have made it more challenging for people to come together and to work together.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: Yeah, I would say that people frequently say that, but that has certainly not been my experience. I would say that in my days as a student, the tensions were higher, the disagreements were greater, the separation among us was certainly more pronounced. And people are kind of inventing a new narrative, that things are so much worse today than they were in the past. I don\u2019t buy that. I think we have new terminology, because the modern sciences of psychology and sociology and so forth and modern media have enabled us to peer into areas that we were not able to see as easily as before. And so when you have social media and all of the ways in which people can now say whatever they want to say \u2014 in an unartful or offensive way \u2014 that turns the volume up to be sure. But it doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t there before.\n\nI would say that the current situation ought to give us much more practice in how to engage with each other because it is not underground. It\u2019s out front, it\u2019s in the open. The media today and the things that are being reported should be upsetting or troubling to students, my goodness. But it may be an even better opportunity to engage students.\n\nAs a teacher, as an educator, I would say these times are especially fertile for teaching the skills that are needed in a world in which there are many types of people, many perspectives and so forth. Students don\u2019t need to feel silenced by the current situation. When students at Brown came to me and said, you know, they were hurt because somebody asked them about their hair, and they were tired of that and they didn\u2019t want any part of it, I would say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s just too bad!\u201d Somebody asked you about your hair, tell them about your hair. You are in college not to hide from that. You\u2019re there to teach the world about yourself, you\u2019re there to learn about others and to teach them about who you are. So I\u2019d rather think this whole notion of protecting people from that is something that we have to take in hand and deal with. And help students see the opportunity in that because if they engage with people who have those kinds of perspectives, they are going to be much stronger in the end than if they run away.\n\nM.J.: Do you see the situation differently for students at H.B.C.U.s? You mentioned that Dillard gave you the space to learn and build confidence before heading to graduate school.\n\nR.S.: There is a narrative that many people have for H.B.C.U.s. People see them as a monolith, or only see them as filling a gap that exists for African-Americans. H.B.C.U.s are not a brand. They are institutions with a certain history \u2014 they were originally set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for education \u2014 but they are not all alike, and are very diverse in what they offer.\n\nPrairie View, for example, is the second-oldest public institution of higher education in the state of Texas. It was set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for ex-slaves and whites. For a long time it provided educational opportunities for black students that wouldn\u2019t have been open to them otherwise. In nursing, architecture, engineering and other STEM fields at a time when many blacks were not able to go into those areas, the university was able to facilitate the entry of blacks into those professions.\n\nM.J.: Yes, this is something that Nikole Hannah-Jones has written about for The New York Times Magazine, in particular how Xavier University of Louisiana sends more black students to medical school than almost any other college in the country. I read that Prairie View has many more students who graduate with degrees in architecture and engineering.\n\nR.S.: Yes, going to Dillard is not like going to Prairie View. So the student who chooses to go to one H.B.C.U. may not find another appealing. That has to do with the unique features of the place, the academic culture and so on, the traditions. All of that makes a big difference.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen I went off to college, I was just trying to find a place where I could be a student without impediments that in that day and time were fairly widely known to be substantial if you enrolled in a majority-white institution. There was no question that in 1963, if you went off to college in the South, you had to be very careful about where you studied. The racial dynamic was very challenging at that time. One of the things I\u2019m learning now is that many of the students I speak to at Prairie View today have the same kinds of thoughts that I had those many years ago. They ask themselves, where can I feel comfortable so that I don\u2019t have to worry about anything but my academic work? So certainly that plays a factor in why students apply to H.B.C.U.s. And for some H.B.C.U.s, applications are way up. But if you reach the point where you think that a category of institutions are the right choice for you \u2014 going to an H.B.C.U. just to go to an H.B.C.U. \u2014 then you\u2019re not thinking broadly enough.\n\nM.J.: As you look across the landscape of higher education, what other challenges do college students face today?\n\nR.S.: I guess I worry a lot about our students having the skills and the experience to promote respectful interactions with a wide-ranging group of people. Students can be quite passionate about what they see on the national scene and how sometimes dangerous they think it is \u2014 how unpleasant it is and so forth. But we\u2019ve got to try to find a way on our campuses not to taint the national picture as hopeless, or as being antithetical to anything that we can think of as good and admirable. The last thing we want is for our students to bow out and decide that it isn\u2019t worth trying to do anything about a hopeless situation.\n\nAnd I do think that civility goes hand in hand with being hopeful. Hopeful that the next person you meet you will be able to converse with you in a respectful way. Hopeful that the next election cycle is going to give you a chance to be engaged and able to do something that makes you feel a sense of your own agency. Hopeful that the things will get better rather than worse.\n\nSo much of what we have to do on our campuses is really to hold open the possibility for people that civil society will in the end right itself \u2014 if enough of us are engaged. I am so thankful every day for the fact that I grew up in a time when nobody thought blacks would be able to be integrated into American society, they would never be able to hold important positions, they\u2019d never be respected intellectually, they\u2019d never be able to do the things that they are now able to do. So why did we persist? And why did we continue to work toward betterment? We did it because we had people working with us in education who were ever hopeful that things were going to change. So I like to say to educators, you have to be always projecting to students that civility enables hopefulness to be ever resurgent.", "keywords": ["leadership", "generation", "able", "simmons", "say", "prairie", "view", "today", "college", "things", "cultivating", "ruth", "students", "dont", "think"], "polarity": 0.18839701321015756, "subjectivity": 0.47766767453623127},

They are quiet, almost too much so. But once you learn what happened in these scenes from small towns, big cities or verdant fields, their almost unemotional first impression gives way to horror: Someone was lynched there.\n\nStarting in 2016, Mr. Clasper traveled through the United States seeking the sites of lynchings. He wanted to show how places that call no attention to themselves were the sites of hangings, slashings or execution by gunfire. In the course of just 24 photos, they span 150 years, right up to the present century, and range from the American south to New York City.\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective, I take it back to 1903, when the American scholar and activist W.E.B. Du Bois said the problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line,\u201d Mr. Clasper said. \u201cIt seems to me not a lot has changed despite significant advances. There has been barely a year or generation that has passed where racism and violence have not been at the forefront of the American experience.\u201d\n\nAs the London-born son of a British mother and American father, Mr. Clasper said he had \u201ca deep spiritual connection to the American landscape.\u201d In this series \u2014 titled \u201cThe Spaces We Inherit\u201d \u2014 he hopes to gently confront viewers in a way that eschews graphic images of violence.\n\n\u201cI took a different approach and focused on the spaces to encourage people to look at this history from an altered perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve become desensitized to images of violence. But everything that happen s has to happen somewhere.\u201d\n\nGiven the persisting tensions over racial and religious prejudice, Mr. Clasper wants to gently provoke a necessary conversation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to investigate these deep-seated issues in America,\u201d he said. \u201cI think many agree that the nation has not dealt with its bloody past of lynchings and segregation. It seemed to me there has been no collective acceptance, let alone recognition of the mistakes made and the sins committed.\u201d\n\nInterviews were conducted by Oliver Clasper and have been edited for brevity.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Jesse Lee Bond, Arlington, Tenn., 1939\n\nOn April 28, 1939, a local sharecropper named Jesse Lee Bond was shot to death in broad daylight by employees of SY Wilson, a local hardware store. Jesse Lee Bond had asked for an invoice the day before after purchasing goods on credit, something that was no\u0095t done by African-Americans at that time as keeping sharecroppers in the dark about how much they had spent was one way for white owners to keep their workers in constant debt. The day of Jesse Lee Bond\u2019s murder he was ordered back to the store. His aunt accompanied him and witnessed the whole thing. \u201cThey shot at him and shot him. He ran out to the outhouse. They riddled the outhouse. And when he staggered out of the outhouse, they threw him down, castrated him, and dragged him to the river,\u0095\u201d she said. The family was told he had drowned accidentally.\n\nImage\n\nSylvester Lewis, Memphis\n\n\u201cI remember my cousin Jesse well. I was 9 when he was killed and he was 20. What I heard was that there had been a dispute at the SY Wilson general store over in Arlington. Jesse insisted on a receipt, but this is something they didn\u2019\u0095t do. I think whoever he was negotiating with relented, but I think the people over him, the father of the individual in question, didn\u2019\u0095t like it. They went to his home and said they wanted to talk to him and ordered him back to the store. When he returned they attacked him. He tried to run for his life but they caught up with him and shot him. I also heard that they dragged his body behind a vehicle and then dumped him in the river. The descendants are running the store now, and I\u2019\u0095m not sure they know what happened. The ones who were allegedly involved in the lynching passed a long time ago, but their relations are still in Arlington. I don\u2019t think there\u2019\u0095s any resentment now. Anyone who hears about it can\u2019\u0095t understand how that could happen. They simply can\u2019t relate to that kind of criminal activity.\u201d\n\nInterviewed November 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Emmett Till, Drew, Miss., 1955.\n\nIn what is one of the most significant race-related events in the history of the United States, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Chicago native, was brutally lynched in rural Mississippi on Aug. 28, 1955. Till, who had been visiting family members in the area, entered a local white-owned grocery store in the town of Money for less than one minute. Whatever was said between him and the proprietor, Carolyn Bryant, was used as the pretext for his murder. Four days later Till was abducted from his uncle\u2019\u0095s house by Roy Bryant, Carolyn\u2019\u0095s husband, and J.W. Milam and driven to a nearby barn where he was severely beaten and tortured (the original wall of the barn can be seen on the left of the photograph). He was then taken to the Tallahatchie River, shot in the head, and drowned with a cotton gin fan tied around his neck. In an infamous court case both defendants were found \u0094not guilty\u0095 by an all-white jury. Months later they sold their story and admitted their guilt, with Bryant claiming that the Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education that desegregated schools was a mistake. Emmett Till\u2019s mother, Mamie Till Bradley, allowed photos to be taken of her son\u2019s broken and swollen body because she \u201cwanted the world to see what they did to my baby.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nDr. Jeffrey Andrews, Drew, Miss.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know the history of the property when I purchased it in 2003 and it was only two years later that a few local people told me of the Emmett Till murder. I\u2019ve lived in Drew since I was 12 and I had never heard of it. I\u2019ve since modified the barn to make it more functional and useful, and someone once asked me why I would change a historical site, but history is in the past and people should move on. Things have changed drastically here in the Mississippi Delta region and race relations are at all-time high. History is an important learning tool and it should be used to help people move forward, but one thing you have to remember is that people here don\u2019t want to be constantly reminded of how things were 60 years ago. We\u2019ve all moved forward, and sometimes people aren\u2019t given enough credit for the changes we\u2019ve made. I respect everyone\u2019s feelings towards Emmett Till, and I\u2019ve met some of his family members. They\u2019re great people. This has been a learning experience for my family and we appreciate the fact that we\u2019re part of a historical site.\u201d\n\nInterviewed March 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Joe Coe, Omaha, 1891\n\nOn Oct. 10, 1891, a 50-year-old African-American named Joe Coe (also known as George Smith) was accused of sexually assaulting a 5-year-old girl and was quickly arrested. Rumors spread that the girl had died and that Coe would get off lightly, neither of which was true. A frenzied mob seized him from the jail at the Douglas County Courthouse, put a rope around his neck, and dragged his body through the streets. Coe was then hanged from a streetcar wire on the corner of 17th and Harney in front of thousands of onlookers. Souvenirs of the rope were later sold. Mayor Richard C. Cushing of Omaha condemned the lynching as \u201c\u0094the most deplorable thing that has ever happened in the history of the country.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Ell Persons, Memphis, 1917\n\nWhen the decapitated body of a 16-year-old local, Antoinette Rappel, was found near the old Wolf River Bridge in May 1917, Ell Persons, a local black woodcutter, was deemed a possible suspect. Despite being arrested and released twice, he was captured a third time and forced to confess. A local mob announced that he was to be lynched the next day. The news spread, and a crowd of 3,000 turned up to witness his lynching (including students of Central High School). Ell Persons was burned on a makeshift pyre in a carnival-like atmosphere. He was then decapitated, and his head was taken to the predominantly African-American Beale Street and thrown at locals. A century later his lynching was commemorated and a historic marker was erected near the site.\n\nImage\n\nAmal Altareb, Memphis\n\n\u201cI came to America in 2012 from Yemen. I\u2019m still learning the language and the history, and it wasn\u2019t until the spring of last year that I learned about lynchings. I knew some of the history of segregation and Jim Crow laws, and I knew how unfair the system was \u2014 that African-Americans weren\u2019t treated as equals \u2014 but I didn\u2019t know that human beings had been burned or hanged from a tree just because of their race. Last year my class at Central High School were discussing it and I asked what lynchings were and they were surprised that I didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s surprising that humans can go so far as to kill someone else in this way and create a festival-like atmosphere. There were even spectators. Uncovering the truth is painful, but it\u2019s important. The African-American students especially don\u2019t talk about it because it\u2019s painful, and it reminds them of the injustices towards their race. White Americans don\u2019t want to remember either because of the guilt they feel. I can understand why people want to avoid the topic, but we need to face history in order to move forward.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Leo Frank, Marietta, Ga., 1915\n\nMary Phagan, 13, was found dead on April 26, 1913, at a National Pencil Company factory where she worked. Amid an atmosphere of anti-Semitism and despite conflicting evidence, a Jewish superintendent named Leo Frank was convicted of the crime. Frank\u2019s sentence was later commuted from the death penalty to life imprisonment, a decision that led a mob on Aug. 17, 1915, to seize him from state prison and lynch him from a tree in Marietta, Mary Phagan\u2019s hometown. Later that year the second chapter of the Ku Klux Klan was founded on Stone Mountain, with a number of Leo Frank\u2019s murderers present. Leo Frank was posthumously pardoned in 1986.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of George W. Murray, Mae Murray Dorsey, Roger Malcom and Dorothy Malcolm, Walton County, Georgia, 1946\n\nAfter Roger Malcom, a World War II veteran and Georgia sharecropper, had been bailed out of jail after allegedly stabbing a white man, members of the local community decided to take revenge. On July 25, 1946, a mob of 15 to 20 stopped the car Malcom was riding in with his wife, Dorothy, and another couple, George W. Murray and Mae Murray Dorsey, who was pregnant. They tied the four of them to a nearby tree and shot them to death. Mae Murray Dorsey then had her unborn baby ripped out of her. Despite an F.B.I. investigation nobody was brought to trial for the crime, and a few months later a grand jury was \u201cunable to establish the identity of any persons guilty of violating the civil rights statute of the United States.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nCeleste Butler, Omaha\n\n\u201cTracing one\u2019s roots and one\u2019s history is hard, especially as an African-American. These are big questions we all want to know: Who are we and where do we come from? I had DNA testing done recently but it didn\u2019t lead anywhere. It just told me that my ancestors came from West Africa, but it couldn\u2019t say where exactly. Missing that part and not being able to hand it down to my children or grandchildren is frustrating. On top of that you hear some people in this country telling black people to \u2018go back home.\u2019 Home to what? Home to whom? It feels like a total assault both mentally and physically to have chapters and generations missing. Not being able to fill that void is difficult. When it comes to racial violence I feel like we\u2019re constantly suffering from PTSD. It\u2019s a stress that never really goes away. A lot of people suffer in pain and in silence, and they suffer for successive generations. Everything was stripped from us, and we\u2019ve been struggling to put the pieces back together ever since.\u201d\n\nInterviewed September 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Michael Donald, Mobile, Ala., 1981\n\nMichael Donald, 19, was abducted on March 21, 1981, by Henry Hays and James Knowles as he was walking home. They beat him, slit his throat, and hanged his body from a tree outside 114 Herndon Avenue. The pretext for Donald\u2019s murder was a \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict handed down by a partially black jury to an African-American man accused of killing a white police officer. This incensed the Alabama chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, led by Benny Jack Hays, the father of Henry Hays, who suggested killing a random black person in response. Michael Donald\u2019s mother, Beulah Mae Donald, with the help of the Southern Poverty Law Center, brought a case not just against the killers but also the United Klans of America. Beulah Mae Donald won the case and received $7 million in damages, essentially bankrupting the U.K.A. Henry Hays was executed, while Knowles received life imprisonment. Hays is the only known Klan member to have been executed in the 20th century for the murder of an African-American. Herndon Avenue has since been renamed Michael Donald Avenue and a historic marker has been erected.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Mulugeta Seraw, Portland, Ore., 1988\n\nOn the evening of Nov. 13, 1988, an Ethiopian student named Mulugeta Seraw was being dropped off at his apartment when he was attacked by Kenneth Mieske, Kyle Brewster and Steve Strasser, members of a local racist skinhead group called East Side White Pride. Mieske delivered the fatal blows with a baseball bat. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 1990 Seraw\u2019s family, represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, brought a civil lawsuit against the killers\u2019 affiliated group, the White Aryan Nation, and its leaders, Tom and John Metzger, for $12.5 million. Tom Metzger later said that the killers had done their \u201ccivic duty\u201d by killing Seraw.\n\nImage\n\nJason Downard, Portland, Ore.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 2 I was put into foster care, and in 2009 I went to prison for a gang-affiliated drive-by shooting. I didn\u2019t grow up racist, but in prison the racist skinheads pulled me into their group and drilled stuff into my head about how the media is run by Jews and that they wanted an all-white nation. I also got a tattoo of a swastika on my leg, which I\u2019ve since had covered up. It\u2019s a painful reminder. The skinheads showed me support and love and compassion, which I hadn\u2019t experienced before in my life; everyone is looking for some kind of acceptance. I was angry and uncomfortable with who I was, and I drove that anger towards people who didn\u2019t look like me. In the last two years of the movement my sister had a son with a black guy and my nephew would give me this look like he knew what I was about. I started to get a guilty conscience and began to think about the things I thought I believed in. My sister said I\u2019d been brainwashed, and I can see why. The movement just taught me to hate and reinforced those views. The problem of racism in this country is much deeper than many people think. When it comes to Trump, he\u2019s tacitly endorsed the alt-right and white supremacists. It\u2019s been a ripple effect and things have gotten worse since he came into power. The right now feel emboldened. I look back now at some of the things I\u2019ve done and I realize that I\u2019ve hurt a lot of people. I decided I wanted to help others who had been in a similar position to me, and that\u2019s been my mission ever since. Now I work for an organization called Life After Hate. I\u2019m a marked man, and maybe I\u2019ll die doing this, but at least I\u2019ll die knowing I did the right thing.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Murder Site of Timothy Caughman, New York City, 2017\n\nOn March 17, 2017 James Harris Jackson traveled from his home in Baltimore to New York City with the intention of killing random black men. The reason, he later told police, was his hatred of interracial relationships. Three days later he found Timothy Caughman, 66, collecting cans in a trash bin on the corner of West 36th and 9th Avenue and stabbed him multiple times with an 18-inch sword. Caughman died of his injuries that night, and two days later Jackson turned himself in, telling police that he had planned to kill more black men in Times Square. On March 27, Jackson was charged with one count each of murder in the first and second degrees as an act of terrorism, second-degree murder as a hate crime, and three counts of criminal possession of a weapon.\n\n\u201cThe Spaces We Inherit,\u201d which will be published as a book by Overlapse in October 2018, is available for pre-order.\n\nFollow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

Though his inquiry is intensely, at times painfully personal, Mr. Wilkerson is above all concerned with unpacking the mechanisms of racial domination. The procedure is akin to performing surgery on a half-conscious subject, or digging up a buried land mine that has lost little of its explosive power.\n\nVideo\n\nThe focus of his excavation is a killing that took place in Dothan, Ala., in 1946, when S.E. Branch, a white shopkeeper, shot Bill Spann, a black man who was in his store. Branch, Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s great-grandfather, was charged with first-degree murder, but no trial was ever held, and the crime faded from memory. Or rather, the memory of it was quietly and systematically suppressed. All that remains are a short newspaper article and a few photographs and home movies of the killer.\n\n\u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d proceeds on several parallel tracks. Mr. Wilkerson returns to Alabama and tries to discover both how Bill Spann died and how he was forgotten. His investigation, accompanied by haunting images of Southern back roads and quiet houses, is punctuated by reminders that Bill Spann\u2019s death is hardly a unique or anomalous event. The names of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and other recent victims of racist violence appear onscreen, and two songs of protest loop into the soundtrack: Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s \u201cHell You Talmbout\u201d and Phil Ochs\u2019s \u201cWilliam Moore.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat song, about a white postal worker and civil rights activist murdered on an Alabama highway in 1963, is the source of the film\u2019s title and a part of its wider cultural context. \u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d is a passionately political film, aflame with rage in spite of its director\u2019s measured, ruminative tone of voice. It is also a horror movie, full of specters and silences and a terror that is pervasive, intimate and elusive.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Wilkerson, whose previous films include \u201cAn Injury to One\u201d and \u201cFar From Afghanistan,\u201d dispenses with many of the usual techniques of historical documentary. There are a few on-camera interviews, with neighbors and relatives, but more frequently Mr. Wilkerson narrates encounters that took place off camera. And his sleuthing often leads not to moments of revelation but to dead ends and deeper mysteries. The insertion of clips from \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d provides a chilling and ironic counterpoint to the grim story this movie is telling. S.E. Branch is the opposite of Gregory Peck\u2019s brave and decent Atticus Finch, and the truth about what happened to Bill Spann resists the kind of redemptive, healing conclusion that remains a cornerstone of American racial fantasy.\n\nInstead of consolation, Mr. Wilkerson offers commitment. Instead of idealism, honesty. He doesn\u2019t suppose that his film will solve anything, but there is nonetheless something profoundly useful about the way he confronts past and present manifestations of white supremacy. He links his great-grandfather\u2019s crime to the contemporaneous gang rape of Recy Taylor (the subject of an excellent recent documentary by Nancy Buirski), and uncovers patterns of abuse within his family. He corresponds with a relative who is part of a white nationalist, \u201cSouthern secessionist\u201d group. He notes the way racial injustice dwells in apparently mundane facts. The killer is immortalized in pictures and a well-kept tombstone. His victim has been almost entirely erased from memory, a kind of second death beyond the reach of redress or revenge.", "keywords": ["white", "supremacy", "movie", "wonder", "bill", "memory", "mr", "fired", "spann", "reckons", "review", "racial", "wilkerson", "gun"], "polarity": 0.04540441176470589, "subjectivity": 0.3202205882352941},

But it\u2019s also a powerful place, and a friendly one for travelers. Image Scenes from Montgomery. Clockwise from top right: Students examine the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Civil Rights Memorial, designed by Maya Lin; a Nat King Cole mural on Maxwell Boulevard near downtown, by the artists Sunny Paulk and Corey Spearman; culinary students Sheldon Warren, Steven McIntyre and Felicia Houston hang out at Aviator Bar after work; the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church, where Dr. King preached. Credit Jada Yuan/The New York Times\n\nDriving by the Alabama State Capitol building in Montgomery, Michelle Browder, an African-American activist and founder of the I Am More Than... youth mentorship nonprofit, pointed out a looming bronze statue of Jefferson Davis, the first and only president of the Confederacy. It has a position of prominence right out front, as does a commemorative plaque on the marble steps marking the exact spot where he stood taking his oath of office in 1861. A state holiday recognizes his birthday. Farther down the Capitol lawn, Ms. Browder said, was a similar statue heralding Dr. J. Marion Sims, but I didn\u2019t recognize the name, and she wouldn\u2019t elaborate. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to do your homework on that one,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause my blood pressure goes up when I talk about him.\u201d\n\nMs. Browder wore red cat-eye glasses, an Army-green jacket, and a T-shirt bearing the words \u201cDream Destroyed\u201d and the face of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who began leading the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955 from the basement of a Baptist church just 440 feet from those Capitol steps. The vehicle she was careening through downtown, often parking akimbo on sidewalks or in the middle of the street, was a six-seat electric cart, from which she leads More Than Tours \u2014 explorations of a city that has been both the site of systemic oppression of her fellow African-Americans and the birthplace of the civil rights movement.\n\nWithin about 10 seconds, she\u2019d risked that blood pressure spike to tell me about Sims. \u201cHe\u2019s known as the father of modern gynecology,\u201d she said. \u201cHe enslaved black women and he used them as experiments.\u201d Specifically, he visited unimaginable tortures on 12 slave women, without anesthesia, under the belief that black people felt less than whites. \u201cWe are starting an initiative,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause we would like to see the mothers of gynecology erected beside him to give more to the story.\u201d The \u201cwe\u201d she refers to is a group she\u2019s organized called Friends of Anarcha, after a woman who endured 30 of Sims\u2019s vaginal surgeries before he declared her a success.\n\nMontgomery was my third stop on an insane yearlong mission I\u2019ve undertaken to visit every spot on The Times\u2019 52 Places to Go in 2018 list, and I was eager to find out why the city had snagged the No. 49 slot. By the end of four days, I\u2019d come to believe it should have ranked higher. As a tourist destination, Montgomery is \u2014 how shall I put this \u2014 heavy. In the same afternoon, visitors can see the Rosa Parks Museum, built at the site of her 1955 arrest for refusing to give up her seat to a white person, and the first White House of the Confederacy, a National Historic Landmark. (Ms. Browder is a descendant of Aurelia Browder, a woman who faced a similar arrest eight months before Parks, and who was the lead plaintiff in the 1956 lawsuit, Browder v. Gayle, that ended the bus boycott.)\n\nThe city is also undeniably relevant right now, with a deep commitment to confronting its past (and often present) of racism, at a time when white supremacism has re-entered the national conversation in a major way. Daily, I found myself moved to tears by any number of tales of brutality or hardship, and the strength it took to tell them. Even the trees that line the streets, dripping with Spanish moss like bearded old men, seem embedded with pain.\n\nI\u2019d arrived in MGM, as residents call it, less than two months after national news outlets had swarmed its streets to document the contentious Senate race in which Doug Jones, a Democrat, defeated Roy S. Moore, the Republican who had been accused of harassing and assaulting teenage girls. \u201cHis office is right there!\u201d Ms. Browder said, pointing to the windows of Mr. Moore\u2019s Foundation for Moral Law, in a building that once housed the bank that funded the Confederacy.\n\nImage A rendering of the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, scheduled to open on April 26. Credit Equal Justice Initiative\n\nWhat really ought to bump Montgomery up the 52 Places list is the National Memorial for Peace and Justice that the Equal Justice Initiative, a human rights legal nonprofit, is scheduled to open on April 26. Inspired by the memorials that Germany, Rwanda and South Africa have built to the atrocities of their own pasts, it pays tribute to the approximately 4,400 black victims of lynching by white mobs in the United States from 1877 to 1950, and is the country\u2019s first comprehensive memorial to racial terrorism.\n\nThe six-acre site and an accompanying museum that aims to link slavery to mass incarceration were under construction when I visited, but plans show it will consist of 800 rectangular, oxidized steel columns, each representing a particular county in the Deep South and Midwest, and bearing the names of the men, women and children killed there. While the columns will appear at first glance to touch the ground, the floor of the memorial will actually slope downward as visitors walk through it, allowing for the columns to hang over them, like bodies.\n\nThe Initiative\u2019s project is in many ways a companion piece to the work that the Southern Poverty Law Center, the nation\u2019s top legal advocate for victims of hate crimes, began in Montgomery with the Civil Rights Memorial in 1989. The memorial, designed by Maya Lin, consists of a stone table overflowing with water, bearing the names of 40 people who were murdered while doing things as simple as registering black people to vote. (A Civil Rights Memorial Center was added in 2005.)\n\nUpon first impression, even with a county population of 230,000, Montgomery seems far too quaint and conservative to be home to two of the country\u2019s most influential, progressive nonprofits fighting racial bias. Its airport has a single baggage claim and the rental car area is dotted with wooden rocking chairs, for an extra dose of Southern charm. I spent 20 minutes answering emails before walking outside and found myself the only person left on the premises, other than three bored-seeming policemen trading stories on the sidewalk.\n\n\u201cYou need a taxi, ma\u2019am?\u201d one of them asked. \u201cHe just left, so it\u2019s going to be 15 or 20 minutes.\u201d \u201cNow, where\u2019s my taxi driver?\u201d the officer mumbled to himself, then got on the radio: \u201cNick, there\u2019s a lady waiting for you.\u201d It took me a minute to absorb what I was hearing, but yes, apparently there was only one taxi driver working in Montgomery on Super Bowl Sunday.\n\nI\u2019d encountered a similar peculiarity earlier that morning, when I\u2019d made a last minute online reservation at a lovely bed-and-breakfast, Red Bluff Cottage, only to receive a distressed call from the owner, Bonnie Ponstein, wondering what time, exactly, I was planning to arrive. She, her husband and their usual housekeeper would all be at church.\n\nThat evening, I went to the city\u2019s historic downtown for an informal tour with an enterprising Lyft driver, Marcus McNeal. We stood talking in the middle of those cobblestone streets for what must have been 30 minutes before another car, or even another person, came by. \u201cYou could shoot a cannon down Dexter Avenue\u201d \u2014 downtown\u2019s main drag \u2014 \u201cand not hit a person on a Sunday,\u201d Barry Ponstein, Bonnie\u2019s husband told me later. \u201cEveryone\u2019s at church.\u201d\n\nThe one person we did meet out and about, actually, was Brother Ricky Segers, whom we found deep into a nightly ritual he\u2019s kept up for three years, of kneeling in front of a tiny souvenir American flag he\u2019s planted on the Capitol grounds to ask Jesus for more \u201cgodly\u201d leaders in this country. He feels as though Roy Moore was \u201cmistreated\u201d and Robert E. Lee was a hero. Still, he and Mr. McNeal, the Lyft driver, who is black and at least half his age, have known each other for a while now and seem to get along great.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to me, too,\u201d said Mr. McNeal of their friendliness. He\u2019s 24, hopes to open a chain of 24-hour coffee shops for workaholics, and comes from what he described as abject poverty. The car he drove me in belongs to his mother, who has been pulling double shifts as a nurse\u2019s assistant to pay for their heating bill that had gone from $80 to $480 during a cold spell that preceded my visit.\n\n\u201cMy mom is 62 years old and she makes $8 an hour, and that\u2019s the most she\u2019s ever made,\u201d he said. Their all-wood house has too much dry rot for them to install insulation, and they haven\u2019t been able to afford replacing the bathroom sink that fell out of their wall. \u201cIt\u2019s O.K.,\u201d he said. \u201cPoverty is a mind-set. If you change your mind-set, you\u2019re going to come out of it eventually.\u201d Later, he declared, \u201cCome back and see me when I have my Bentley.\u201d\n\nThe ad hoc tour Mr. McNeal took me on had been refreshingly frank. He drove straight to a historical placard describing the bustling slave markets that had been held at Court Square, the city\u2019s central roundabout. I asked Mr. McNeal why it didn\u2019t have more central placement in the square and he just laughed: \u201cWhat else are they going to do? It\u2019s not like they can build an auction platform here. That would really piss some people off!\u201d\n\nWhen I mentioned to him that multiple people had suggested I eat at Central, an upscale Southern food restaurant in downtown\u2019s tiny revitalized commercial district, he joked, \u201cCentral is so expensive, you\u2019d be better off buying a restaurant and opening and stocking the kitchen yourself.\u201d We went to Applebee\u2019s instead, and gorged on spinach and artichoke dip.\n\nI did end up at Central on another night, and it was indeed quite good \u2014 part of a growing culinary scene that will include gourmet offerings at the renovated Kress on Dexter building downtown, which opens in April. The former block-wide department store, built in 1929, will host rotating pop-up markets devoted to local artists \u2014 and has been engaged in incredibly responsible historical preservation, which has included donating bricks made by enslaved people to EJI \u2014 as well as keep its old \u201cWhites Only\u201d and \u201cColored Only\u201d signs on display for posterity. I\u2019m also a fan of the coffee shops Prevail Union and Cafe Louisa, as well as bar standouts like Leroy Lounge, a dive with a terrific selection of wines and craft beers, and Aviator Bar, covered in airplane-themed kitsch \u2014 inspired by the Wright Brothers, who started the country\u2019s first civilian flight school outside Montgomery.\n\nI met a group of black culinary students there one night who not only knew the city\u2019s history but said it fueled their ambitions. \u201cWe\u2019re in a bar on the road that was used to bring people to be auctioned off,\u201d said Steven McIntyre, who interns as a line cook at the highly regarded restaurant Vintage Year, \u201cand the fact that we are here today, just hanging out, enjoying life, it\u2019s incredible. Not super long ago, we would not be chilling here. This would not be chill.\u201d\n\nMy best culinary experiences, though, came by way of cabdrivers I\u2019d met. Nick Alloway, that lone Sunday driver, sent me to Mrs. B\u2019s Home Cooking, a yellow-painted soul food restaurant a few minutes west of downtown that serves up a different featured meat every day. Blocks north of the Capitol building is Davis Cafe, an even older family-run soul food joint that\u2019s the haunt of Hillard Wright, a King\u2019s Airport shuttle driver with a salt-and-pepper mustache, a gruff baritone voice and a leather rancher\u2019s hat that never left his head. He spent a whole afternoon showing me his version of the city he\u2019s lived in all of his 66 years. State senators were crowded into every vinyl booth. My plate overflowing with collard greens, creamed corn, peas and okra, turkey dressing, yams and cornbread cost around $6.\n\nFollowing the spirit of the locals I had met, I tried to absorb as much history as I could in four days: The Dexter Parsonage Museum, where Dr. King lived in the 1950s; the F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald Museum in the home where their marriage dissolved; Hank Williams\u2019s grave in the Oakwood Annex Cemetery. What stuck with me more than any of those, though, were the three hours I spent with Mr. Wright, engaging in his favorite pastime of driving around and looking at old houses. He\u2019d introduce each neighborhood with factoids about its legal, and later, de facto, segregation status. Entering the \u201cold money\u201d neighborhood of Old Cloverdale, for example, he pointed out, \u201cif you\u2019ll notice, you don\u2019t see any black folks living in there.\u201d I did notice.\n\nMr. Wright, though, is not bitter. He has built for himself a quiet life of hunting and fishing, driving around for money and minding his own business. \u201cEven through the segregation and hatred,\u201d he said, \u201cMontgomery, I wouldn\u2019t trade it. I\u2019ve been here my whole life and I\u2019ve enjoyed every day.\u201d\n\nThis year, the city will erect its first statue to Dr. King, in front of the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church where he used to preach near the Capitol. The statues of J. Marion Sims and Jefferson Davis, erected in 1939 and 1940, will be in view, too. Alabama will remain one of two states that celebrate the King and Lee birthdays in a combined holiday. This is how change seems to come in Montgomery: messy and long overdue. Still, how wonderful to see progress in action.\n\nJada Yuan will be traveling to every place on this year\u2019s 52 Places to Go list. Her next dispatch will be from Disney Springs, Fla.

Does it bother you, that designation?\n\nWe were making fun of my persona. I\u2019m not a household name like Brad Pitt. People like to have labels for actors, and the truth is, every actor is a character actor. When I say actor, I mean actresses as well. Toni Collette is a good example of someone who can do both leading lady and transformational characters, where you\u2019re barely recognizing them. I think Billy Crudup, Chris Walken, Robert De Niro, they\u2019re all great examples of that.\n\nPeople often use the word \u201cquirky\u201d to describe your characters.

I can relate to self-loathing. The reason a person lashes out the way Dixon does is because he hates himself, so anybody can relate to that. I\u2019m drawn to complex characters; they\u2019re all filled with so many different feelings, and that\u2019s what makes them interesting. The first \u201cIron Man,\u201d Tony Stark, was an interesting character. He drinks too much, he\u2019s a womanizer, and then he has this epiphany. That\u2019s what\u2019s interesting.\n\nWhat do you think it was about this role, and this film, that led to so many awards?\n\nIt\u2019s the transformational aspect of it, the fact that he was really many different roles wrapped up in one role. He\u2019s a doofus, he\u2019s a racist, he\u2019s violent, he\u2019s a mama\u2019s boy. There\u2019s a few heroic things at certain points. But he\u2019s very flawed, and it\u2019s a boy-to-man journey.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere\u2019s been criticism that your character got away scot-free for his racist behavior and for throwing a guy out the window, and never being brought to justice.\n\nIt\u2019s a small town and, who knows, in real life maybe he would have gotten thrown in prison. It\u2019s a sort of dark fairy tale in certain ways \u2014 it\u2019s not necessarily meant to be completely realistic. And if it is meant to be realistic, in real life, things aren\u2019t tied up in a bow. People who deserve to get punished don\u2019t necessarily get punished.\n\nDid it surprise you that there was criticism of the movie along these lines?\n\nNo, whenever a movie is popular and it is a complex dramatic story, I think it\u2019s going to stir up a lot of feelings. A lot of good stuff come out of it \u2014 the billboards that have been popping up [activists recreated versions of the billboards in Miami and London]. That\u2019s kind of incredible, when a movie can effect social change, that\u2019s kind of astounding. I think Mildred [the film\u2019s mother, played by Frances McDormand, who is seeking justice in the murder of her daughter] is a really beautiful working-class wonder woman in some ways. It\u2019s a kind of antihero slash protagonist thing that I think women really need right now. Mildred and [the directors] Greta Gerwig and Patty Jenkins. It\u2019s been an incredibly vibrant year.\n\nYou\u2019re a really good dancer \u2014 you can really bust a move. You did the splits on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d How did that come about? Is it self-taught?\n\nIt\u2019s a long story, but I hung out with a certain crowd, and it was a way to meet girls.\n\nWhat kind of certain crowd?\n\nSan Francisco is not all cable cars and Rice-A-Roni. There were some tough kids there. When I was in middle school, there was a more white supremacist kind of group I didn\u2019t get along with. I got in a lot of fights with them and didn\u2019t win a lot of those fights. I didn\u2019t get along with the rich kids, people we called WPODs: white punks on dope. My school was interracial, and I met a cool group of friends who introduced me to some other friends. I used to do really bad break dancing, when \u201cThriller\u201d and \u201cPurple Rain\u201d came out. I was into Run-DMC, Grandmaster Flash, Doug E. Fresh, Eric B. & Rakim. Probably my biggest inspiration was James Brown, and watching Tom Cruise in \u201cRisky Business.\u201d I remember practicing that, and watching James Brown do the splits. I [recently] did SoulCycle, I\u2019m not proud to say, and Usher was next to me. I thought I had rhythm until I was on a bicycle next to Usher. This is what happens when you go to spinning class in Hollywood.\n\nWere you intimidated working with Frances McDormand?\n\nI think it\u2019s the biggest compliment to Frances that people are asking, \u201cWere you intimidated by her?\u201d Not really, but I was nervous to get in the ring with a great actor. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of great actors. She\u2019s really a force. I think what\u2019s great about her is her integrity. Her sense of truth is like an iron bar. All these people \u2014 Woody [Harrelson, a co-star], Martin [McDonagh, the film\u2019s writer-director], Frances \u2014 are true anarchists, they really are. I think it comes through in their work. I\u2019m not exactly conventional either.\n\nSo your dad posted a comment on that New York Times essay criticizing the film \u2014 he defended you. Was it definitely your dad?\n\nYes that was my father. I didn\u2019t read the article, but they read that quote to me on the Jimmy Kimmel show. That was my dad being a supportive father.

While it may not be a common vantage point, the narrative is a natural one for Marilyn Stern, a photographer and graphic artist who is a member of the Metropolitan Postcard Club of New York City.\n\nNot surprisingly, the vast majority of postcards that feature black people in the United States from the 19th and 20th centuries were very racist, she said.\n\n\u201cI was so sick of seeing these horrible racist stereotypes,\u201d said Ms. Stern, a collector since the mid-1970s. \u201cWhenever I came across something that was not racist or not stereotypical, or even went so far as showing romance between the races, I wanted to save it and collect it.\u201d\n\nHer collection, which numbers about 3,000, has about 300 postcards that depict African-American life in all lights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for us to fathom how isolated people were, especially in rural areas and isolated small towns before there were telephones and radios,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were postal deliveries three times a day, so it was the internet of the early 1900s.\u201d\n\nPostcards had better printing technology than magazines and newspapers did at the time, as the burst of color in the selection below shows. They could show racism with clarity. \u201cThe idea that you could see images so realistic blew people away,\u201d she said.\n\nMany of the racist postcards were a form of propaganda, she said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to see how racism was manifested in the past,\u201d she said, \u201cperhaps to better fight it in the present. You can recognize something if you\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d\n\nBelow is a selection from Ms. Stern\u2019s collection with descriptions based on her research.\n\nTrade Cards\n\nImage\n\nAfrican-Americans were often subjects \u2014 and targets \u2014 of advertising cards that were issued before 1900. These cards were frequently given away in products, or with the purchase of a product.\n\nAbove, an advertisement for J & P Coats thread. Below, a country doctor dispensing Ayer\u2019s Cathartic Pills.\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk, a dance created by plantation slaves as a satire of Southern white society, was the focus of these cards, which featured two black children and an African-American troupe that toured Europe in the late 1800s and early 1900s.\n\nRacist Cards\n\nImage\n\nThe card on the left was shot in a professional studio, but it was labeled \u201cHer Country Cousins.\u201d The implication was that no matter how refined, educated or successful black Americans became, they were still basically savages, Ms. Stern said.\n\nThe two cards on the right were produced in 1905 in New York on the common theme of the delivery stork. The first one, with the caption \u201cComparing Notes,\u201d shows both a black baby and a white baby, with no apparent bias. The second one shows two black babies with the slogan \u201cNo Race Suicide,\u201d implying that a high black birthrate threatened white supremacy, she said.\n\n\u201cLovers of All Nations\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThis postcard was from a series mailed in 1908 that was called \u201cLovers of All Nations.\u201d The banjo was a racial stereotype, but the card is in the non-discriminating \u201cFamily of Man\u201d tradition.\n\nMemories of Slavery\n\nImage\n\nPostcards once served as documentary photography. Some cards honored older African-Americans of the South, who were living memories of slavery. This was part of a series, and it was mailed in 1906.\n\nLife in the Jim Crow South\n\nImage\n\nA fortuneteller with white clients, mailed in 1908.\n\nHoliday Greetings\n\nImage\n\nIdealized country life, in a card mailed in 1907, as Americans flocked to cities.\n\nReligion\n\nImage\n\nA card, likely from the early 1950s, urging parishioners to come to church.\n\nReal Photos\n\nImage\n\nAn unidentified young woman in her graduation cap and gown, in a studio portrait taken between the 1920s and \u201940s. Cards labeled \u201cReal Photo Postcards\u201d are set apart from commercially printed postcards and are actual photographs printed on photographic paper with a preprinted postcard back.\n\nAchievement\n\nImage\n\nThe many important contributions that African-Americans made to society were rarely acknowledged in older postcards, but an exception was made for the scientist and educator George Washington Carver.\n\nHis experiments with peanuts, sweet potatoes and other crops contributed greatly to the economy of the South. This card \u2014 from a photo shot on Kodachrome or Ektachrome film \u2014 is from the late 1950s to mid-60s.\n\nFor more, see Ms. Stern\u2019s postcard blog, and a review of the film Through a Lens Darkly that deals with African-American representation in postcards and photography.

A graduate of Nascar\u2019s Drive for Diversity program, Darrell Wallace Jr., 24, could give stock car racing something it has never had before: an African-American star.\n\nBut that is not why Richard Petty brought Wallace onto his team. Late last season, Wallace, who goes by the nickname Bubba, got four rides with Richard Petty Motorsports. It was enough for Petty, one of Nascar\u2019s most iconic names, to not only give Wallace a full-time ride, but also to give him his famed No. 43 racecar to drive. Wallace is the first African-American to drive full-time in the top Nascar series since Wendell Scott in 1971.\n\nPetty insisted, though, that he is colorblind when it comes to evaluating talent.

He admits he has not always been successful.\n\n\u201cThere is always going to be haters out there, people who don\u2019t want to see you succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that since Day 1 from my parents.

He\u2019s an amazing ambassador for the sport. And he\u2019s really talented and a heck of a competitor.

A native of Monterrey, Mexico, Su\u00e1rez said he had noticed an uptick in social media messages from a variety of Latino countries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually either people who tell me they\u2019re now following the sport because of me, or they\u2019ve been fans and now they have a driver to root for,\u201d said Su\u00e1rez, who is also a graduate of the Drive for Diversity program. \u201cThe potential is huge. This is the most diverse country in the world, but we have to improve diversity in Nascar. If we can make the sport more diverse, we\u2019ll see the same thing with fans.

Townships have gotten electricity and more modern housing. Government contracts have been set aside for black would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nThese programs have had an impact, improving material conditions and generating jobs.\n\nThey have also been riddled with corruption.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt local governments across South Africa, bureaucrats have abused their authority to steer contracts to companies that put cash in their pockets. At every level of society, people have grown accustomed to kickbacks and political connections determining who prospers, and who goes without.\n\nMr. Zuma\u2019s demise resonates as a sign of a potential new order taking shape. He will forever be linked to his association with the Guptas, three Indian-born brothers who effectively bought key levers of governmental power, amassing influence so comprehensive that it became known as \u201cstate capture.\u201d\n\nHis resignation has raised hopes that South Africa is finally contending with its epidemic of corruption. That view gained momentum when an elite police unit raided a home belonging to the Guptas nearly at the same moment that Mr. Ramaphosa was assuming office.\n\nThe new president is a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle, a former deputy president and chairman of the National Planning Commission, a focal point for thinking about how to engineer economic growth. As a former trade union leader and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Mandela, he enjoys credibility among a range of interest groups, while carrying a reputation as a savvy and strategic operator.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe has had his brushes with controversy, most notably after a 2012 police massacre of striking platinum miners that killed 34 people. At the time, Mr. Ramaphosa occupied a seat on the board of Lonmin, the company that owned the mine. Emails soon surfaced showing that, a day before the police opened fire, Mr. Ramaphosa had been urging senior government officials to take strong action to end the strike.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, no corruption charges have stuck to the new president, who now claims a mandate to clean up the toxic mess left behind by Mr. Zuma.\n\nSome doubt whether the A.N.C. can be salvaged as an effective vehicle for egalitarian policymaking. The party\u2019s executive ranks include many figures implicated in corruption. Mr. Ramaphosa, 65, may champion new initiatives aimed at generating economic growth, yet he finds himself relying on his party brethren to execute his visions, with no certainty that the money will land where intended.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think that taking the president out does much to dismantle the patronage network,\u201d said Ayabonga Cawe, a development economist at Xesibe Holdings, a research and advisory firm in Johannesburg. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need a lot more than taking out the guy at the top.\u201d\n\nAbove all, Mr. Ramaphosa must contend with the structural defects that have long constrained South Africa\u2019s economy, a legacy of apartheid.\n\nBeyond its systemic discrimination against black people, apartheid severed the country from much of the global economy. It ensured that huge numbers of uneducated black South Africans were available at poverty-level wages within major sectors of the economy like mining, agriculture and textiles. That cushioned domestic companies from the pressure to modernize.\n\nPhoto\n\nInternational sanctions isolated South Africa, shielding its firms from competition against multinational rivals. Sanctions also denied South African companies the ability to operate abroad, giving them an incentive to focus on the domestic market. The apartheid-era government obliged with subsidies for favored firms while allowing companies to pursue oligopoly, free of nuisances like antitrust law.\n\nThe result was a system in which large industries, from retail to furniture-making to chemicals, were dominated by huge enterprises whose core strength was the ability to protect themselves against competition. That system has largely prevailed, with smaller companies and start-ups facing often-impossible odds.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cApartheid was a system that lends itself to large conglomerates and concentrations of wealth in the hands of a few,\u201d Mr. Cawe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the corruption. It\u2019s about all of these parallel networks in big business that you need to dismantle. Most of those are white.\u201d\n\nHere is a world that Mr. Ramaphosa knows keenly, having achieved extraordinary affluence by running South African companies with interests in mining, banking, real estate and telecommunications. His fortune has been estimated at $450 million.\n\nIf he is serious about reinvigorating the economy and creating a space for black-owned small businesses, he will need to take on the prevailing structure that made him so wealthy.\n\nHis success on that front may be even more decisive than whether he can tame corruption.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly the most optimistic moment for South Africa in a very long time,\u201d said Mr. Goldin, the former adviser to Mr. Mandela. \u201cIn a way, it does feel like a new beginning.

The aggressive pace of deportations of immigrants of color, the elimination of the DACA program protecting immigrant children and the proposals propounded by the anti-immigration voices in the administration will all have the undeniable effect of slowing the rapid racial diversification of the United States population. Despite this sweeping attempt at racial social engineering, few voices in progressive and Democratic circles are responding with the kinds of outrage that one would expect.\n\nThe pro-white preferences of Donald Trump and his administration, especially when it comes to immigration, are legion. From the day he opened his presidential campaign in 2015 by demonizing Mexicans to the enthusiasm generated by the calls for building a wall along the Mexican border to aggressively ramping up deportations of immigrants of color to eliminating DACA to vulgarly denigrating African nations and Haiti, this administration has been quite clear about its preference for white people.\n\nIt should be no surprise, then, that the immigration policies championed by the White House would all have the effect of reducing the number of people of color coming into the country. A recent study by The Washington Post found that the administration\u2019s proposals to curtail legal immigration by limiting family reunification would slightly delay the date when whites become a minority. \u201cBy greatly slashing the number of Hispanic and black African immigrants entering America, this proposal would reshape the future United States,\u201d the economist Michael Clemens said.\n\n\u201cDecades ahead,\u201d he added, \u201cmany fewer of us would be nonwhite or have nonwhite people in our families.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe administration\u2019s focus is not random.

The very first immigration law passed, the Naturalization Act of 1790, declared that to become a citizen, one had to be a \u201cfree white person.\u201d That demarcation was the explicit law of the land for the next 162 years, until 1952. There are 20th-century Supreme Court cases explicitly holding that Asian immigrants could not become United States citizens because they were not white.

Almost all of those who led the campaign to bring him to account were black, like Thuli Madonsela, the former public protector, who played a heroic role in exposing Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption. South Africa\u2019s judiciary, which is majority black, defended the independence of the courts with extraordinary courage and under great pressure. After this display of black courage, why would it matter what white people think?\n\nBut South Africa is too fraught and complex a place for such a simple story to ring true. More plausible is that each pinprick penetrating Mr. Zuma\u2019s skin is felt by black South Africans, even those who are horrified by what he has done.\n\nBeneath the surface of public life, one can detect a strange, subliminal to-and-fro. Last year, for instance, a superb book describing in meticulous detail the deep corruption of the late apartheid years, \u201cApartheid Guns and Money,\u201d by Hennie van Vuuren, was a runaway best seller. It deserved to be widely read, but the scale of its success is partly a function of its utility as a weapon against white arrogance. \u201cHowever bad Zuma is,\u201d its many black readers could say to themselves, \u201cyou people were worse.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

For the truth is that Mr. Zuma and his allies were corrupt partly because they felt a sense of grievance intimately connected to their experience of race.\n\nWhen Mr. Zuma became president of South Africa in 2009, he rallied behind him an alliance of people who felt themselves to be marginal and neglected, not just in relation to the world economic order or white South Africa but also in relation to the A.N.C. itself. The A.N.C. has been run by people drawn from the ranks of an urbane, cosmopolitan elite.\n\nMr. Zuma represented a dramatic change in this tradition. Although he spent years in exile and climbed the ranks of the A.N.C., his biography was unlike any of his predecessors\u2019. Nelson Mandela was born into royalty. Thabo Mbeki was the son of prominent intellectuals. Mr. Zuma\u2019s mother worked in the kitchen of a white family and was too poor to provide her son with a formal education. He grew up herding cattle in the hinterland.\n\nWhen he came to power in 2009, he did so with the support of organizations representing much of the urban working class \u2014 the country\u2019s largest trade union and the South African Communist Party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut he soon dropped these organizations and turned for support to rural South Africa, in particular to traditional leaders and to the elites of far-flung provincial capitals. They carried with them into power an abiding sense of powerlessness, a feeling that the very institutions they now controlled were alien and belonged to others. In office, they believed that they had entered into their enemy\u2019s mansion. It seemed to be payback time.\n\nIn a speech delivered to a room of black businesspeople in December 2016, Mr. Zuma warned of the sophisticated ways in which the enemy confuses black people. One source of such confusion was the prevailing economic orthodoxy. Mr. Zuma suggested that the most fundamental of economic laws was merely nominal; remove the scales from our eyes and we see that so-called economic laws are a ruse invented by the powerful.\n\nHis genre of criminality is light-years from the sort that characterized the apartheid state. The corruption of apartheid\u2019s leaders stemmed from arrogance; they believed that they could control the world forever. Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption stems from the grievances of a man who feels very small.\n\nThis sense of grievance was on display in the last words he uttered publicly as president. In a swipe at his successor, Mr. Ramaphosa, Mr. Zuma suggested that those in the party who had unseated him were \u201cserving the interests of the oppressors of yesteryear, who joyfully celebrate as we lynch one another.\u201d\n\nBlack nationalism in South Africa has many faces. Mr. Ramaphosa represents a strand that is bourgeois, worldly and comfortable with power. There is also a militant, socialist strand of black nationalism, but it is on the wane. And there is the strand represented by Mr. Zuma, who governed as a man shaped and distorted by the violence and oppression of white supremacy.\n\nI am of course alive to the irony of a white South African like me saying that a black president\u2019s corruption was motivated by racial grievance. Many South Africans, black and white, would regard this argument as an excuse for the intolerable. But we should be honest enough to accept that even now, notwithstanding that apartheid has been gone since before nearly half the South African population was born, the legacy of white supremacy has lived on in the man who was president.", "keywords": ["white", "apartheid", "mess", "whats", "south", "corruption", "africa", "zuma", "mr", "economic", "zumas", "jacob", "distinctive", "black"], "polarity": 0.0616115067727971, "subjectivity": 0.37158776707163793},

Evenly lit, crisply photographed, they look like pictures from an illustrated medical dictionary, indexical images of heads, torsos and mouths that are detached from context. Even in a work like \u201cFigure\u201d (1991), the figure in question, sheathed in a black dress and set in the black infinity of no particular place, feels like a fragment, as though she had been extracted from a group photo or a furnished room. The texts accompanying her, eight engraved plastic plaques, read like excerpts from a language primer: \u201cfigured the worst,\u201d \u201che was disfigured,\u201d \u201cfigured there would be no reaction\u201d and so on. Here, not only has the story been winnowed down; it is in fact completely gone. There\u2019s no story. We are left with only the tensions of concrete poetry.\n\nSometime in the mid-1990s, Simpson began to detect clich\u00e9d responses to her work. At the same time, her own thinking was evolving. What does an image of a black woman mean? A commentary on race? An assertion about gender? Simpson branched out from figure-based images and began to experiment more with varied subject matter \u2014 landscapes and inanimate objects like wigs \u2014 and also with unusual quasi-sculptural material like felt and standing screens. A series of monumental multisectional images, several of them landscapes, collectively titled \u201cPublic Sex\u201d (1995-1998) and featuring no figures at all, addressed the provocative title only obliquely. These pictures, made over many years, contain what the scholar and curator Okwui Enwezor calls \u201cthe rumor of the body.\u201d Mysteries of a jagged and deadpan sort, they would go on to influence the noirish tone of Simpson\u2019s later film work.\n\nPhoto\n\nSimpson began to set ever more intricate conceptual layers between her initial inspiration for a work and the finished product. The idea for \u201c9 Props\u201d (1995) began during a residency at the Pilchuck Glass School in Washington. With the aid of artisans at the school, she fabricated a series of dark vessels modeled on vases and other objects used in the portrait work of the pioneering Harlem photographer James Van Der Zee. But these vessels were not the final work. She shipped them back to New York and then photographed them against a plain background. And that still was not the work. Further intervention followed: She turned those photographic images into nine lithographs, which she printed on felt. Finally, she wrote captions below each lithographed vessel, describing the context in which it originally appeared. One of them, for instance, reads:\n\nDinner Party with boxer Harry Wills, 1926 James VanDerZee Harry Wills a k a \u201cThe Black Panther,\u201d boxer, businessman- sits with seven other men and women, mostly women with champagne glasses raised as a woman on his left makes a toast in his honor. There are three bottles of champagne, a crystal decanter, a bottle of port, an arrangement of flowers and fruit, and before each guest an untouched china place setting.\n\nPhoto\n\nFrom multiple directions, the work gestures at what cannot be seen: the original placement of the vessels that inspired Simpson\u2019s own, the people in the photographs by James Van Der Zee, the social life of Harlem evoked by his photographs and the complexity of manners and class implied by them. All that vanished world of culture and experience is reduced to an elegant grid, as simple as an antiquarian\u2019s catalog, a thought picture that demands calm engagement and imaginative intervention on the viewer\u2019s part. Without being representational, it is about race; but race is not off in some category by itself, hemmed in only by questions of skin color, separate from life.\n\n\u201cRepresent!\u201d in the black American sense means standing up for your people, expressing solidarity and letting a shared ethos underwrite your presence and work. It is an exhortation, a greeting and a farewell. The word also has more conventional associations. In the visual arts, it is contrasted with the abstract or the symbolic. To represent, in this more common sense, is to make work that visually corresponds to realities out there in the world: to illustrate uncomplicatedly. This second sense of \u201crepresent\u201d is enjoying a vogue in the art world. Realism is back. This is welcome: after so long an absence of black figures and black faces in art museums, they are now being seen more frequently. Many artists, black and otherwise, are depicting the black body. It is necessary and often successful. Just as often, it fails when it is little more than a clumsy shorthand for socially concerned art, unobjectionable and unimpressive.\n\nA strong appeal of Simpson\u2019s work is that she has always embraced the inherent complexity of blackness, her own blackness as well as the blackness that runs ineluctably through American history. She does not reject representational depictions, but neither does she feel the need to confine herself only to \u201crace\u201d work. When an artist uses a black model, she is presenting a human question by foregrounding a human presence. Is a white man a person while a black woman is and can only be a gendered and racialized subject? As the scholar Kellie Jones has pointed out, nonwhite bodies are often thought of as \u201cnot neutral enough for the dispassionate formulas thought to constitute conceptual practice.\u201d If a black woman\u2019s race and gender are the only things apparent to certain viewers, Simpson seems to say, the ethical responsibility to escape those shackles is the viewer\u2019s.\n\nFreedom is Lorna Simpson\u2019s starting point and her permanent theme. A humane current animates all of her work, a current that neither sidesteps nor confines itself to race. Her work is simultaneously about the \u201cneutral\u201d space of ideas and the particularized experience of the body. \u201cMontage\u201d is photographic and painterly, a riff on a pair of found photographs, sequenced to look like a giant strip of film. It deals with dreams and nightmares, ambiguities and vulnerabilities.

To some extent, there\u2019s always been an adversarial role between the White House and reporters. How do you feel about the tenor of things now? It used to be friendly-adversarial. There would be retaliation for stories they didn\u2019t like, but nothing compared with this. There\u2019s a war going on. For a president to come out with the term \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 he\u2019s putting targets on our heads. He has moved the goal posts when it comes to how politicians and people deal with the press.\n\nWhat\u2019s the value of the White House press briefing? Transparency. There is a veil on the White House; people want to look behind the curtain. It\u2019s their house. When you open up a press briefing to see the back and forth, you\u2019re getting more in the weeds of what\u2019s going on, beyond just the quote we may put in the story. This is a key piece that I don\u2019t think people really get: When you talk about the press, it\u2019s not about journalists; it\u2019s about the free-flowing information that the American public is supposed to get. When you bash the press, you\u2019re bashing the idea of getting truth out.\n\nWhat\u2019s the public opinion of the White House press corps? It depends on whom you talk to. We\u2019re so tribal now. There used to be a day when you didn\u2019t know the person\u2019s politics. The line has been obscured between facts and opinion. I think it started during the Clinton years, and it just kept getting progressively worse. People don\u2019t want to just hear the news; they want to hear what people have to say about it too.\n\nYour reactions during the televised briefings have generated memes. Has it made you more self-conscious? I\u2019m so sad about that. My boss has always said, \u201cYou need to know how to play poker.\u201d I don\u2019t. I\u2019m trying! The last time I was really caught off guard was when Sarah Huckabee Sanders said something about people\u2019s minds being in the gutter after President Trump\u2019s tweet about Kirsten Gillibrand. I really get into those briefings. I really try to listen. I don\u2019t play to the camera. I go in there, and I\u2019m really earnest. So when she said that, I was shocked! I was like, No, God, that was a little bit much.\n\nGiven how much you tangle with this particular administration, why do you think you get called on so much? Have you felt like a target? Yes, I have. But I have to shake that off, because I have to go in and do my job. I cover the White House. I cover all issues, particularly those that affect black and brown Americans. Now, what if they didn\u2019t call on me? A certain segment of America would not get the answers to some of their pressing questions. If I don\u2019t ask, who will?\n\nRyan is the White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks and a political analyst for CNN.

You had to ask whether this president believed slavery was wrong. I recently asked him, \u201cAre you a racist?\u201d It\u2019s a sad day when you have to ask a sitting president that. There has been a series of comments or lack of action, from calling Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas\u201d to how he dealt with Charlottesville to his comments on Norway versus Haiti, Africa, El Salvador, black and brown nations. It\u2019s not been one thing. It\u2019s been a pattern. So I asked. He did not answer, which I thought was a wasted moment. He could have put it to rest right then and there and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a racist.\u201d But it took him days to say that.\n\nYou said it seems as if it has changed, going forward, how the White House deals with the press corps and wields its power. What do you think this means for the next president you cover? He\u2019ll clamp down harder on us. Each president has pushed us further away from access. Who knows what will happen or what another president may want? They may not want to be followed. President Obama didn\u2019t like being followed, for example. This president hates us.

I\u2019d love to jump right in and hear your aspirations for Prairie View. What do you hope to accomplish in your time as president? I assume you had many offers to lead other colleges. Why was Prairie View different?\n\nRuth Simmons: Well, I\u2019m a native of Texas, and one of the things that I did when I returned to Houston after I retired from Brown was think about the ways I could use my experience to help the community. I started with small ventures in the city, but I hadn\u2019t thought really that another university would be in my life. But when I was approached by Prairie View, I thought immediately about its significant impact on my brother, who went there. And what Dillard did for me.\n\nI grew up in a segregated neighborhood in Grapeland, Tex., with very little experience with the world. The transition that Dillard enabled for me was extremely valuable. As an undergraduate, I began to grow a sense of confidence that helped me move from a fairly insular environment to a bigger stage when I went to graduate school.\n\nMy aspirations for Prairie View are to essentially make sure the university is continuing to do the same thing for students today that it did for my brother \u2014 and Dillard did for me. And that is to offer the advantage of a strong education that will prepare students for the careers they want, in a social and cultural context that helps them develop the confidence to perform after graduation.\n\nAs president, that means focusing on time-honored strategies to success that apply to universities everywhere: worrying about the faculty who are recruited here, the campus experience, and whether we are providing the leadership and internship opportunities that students need. It means worrying about the reputation of the university. It\u2019s obviously a much more competitive world today than it was when I was a student, but the underlying work to move the university to a level of achievement that makes students and alumni proud is the same.\n\nM.J.: What do you see as some of the major challenges facing historically black colleges and universities?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: The general challenge for H.B.C.U.s is not unlike the problem many universities face today, and that is the financial model. Being tuition dependent has become a large problem for all universities. H.B.C.U.s are dependent on raising money, but that is a reality that most universities obviously face. So it very much depends on the question of whether the schools have a good-enough foundation because of secure financing. When it comes to the federal government\u2019s role in supporting H.B.C.U.s, I think we don\u2019t yet understand the extent to which they will be affected by the changes in Washington today. To say that many are not hopeful in this moment is an understatement. We just don\u2019t know.\n\nFrankly, that\u2019s why I advocate for developing enough financial independence to secure the future of our institutions. That means looking for different revenue streams, looking to increase our ability to raise funds and finding alternate programs that help to bring more income into our university. The only strategy cannot be to persistently raise tuition, making college outside the reach of many families.\n\nM.J.: You\u2019ve led several institutions that are all very different from each other, and the topic of leadership is something you\u2019ve talked a lot about. In another interview with The Times you said that it\u2019s much easier to lead people \u201cif you convey the underlying principles.\u201d Can you elaborate?\n\nR.S.: One thing that I\u2019ve learned is that the perceptions of what it takes to be a leader are often based on prototypical models that don\u2019t have much truth in reality. People look at the institutions that I have led and they see dissimilarities. I see similarities. When people think in terms of leadership, they\u2019re often thinking about the kind of specific skills needed for different types of enterprises. I think of leadership as more of a disposition \u2014 the ability to step into a situation to learn about the history of the enterprise, the opportunities that it faces, the culture that exists and the people who are served by it. To look at all of that, to listen to stakeholders and then to think about how that enterprise or institution should best be served. There is no one model of leadership if you approach it that way. What I have tried to do wherever I go is to start where the institution is rather than try to import particularly rigid constructs from other places. In that sense, I think a leader is more than anything else a facilitator. A person who is able to come in to show a community a picture of what it is, to provide some insight into what it could be \u2014 how it could be different or improved perhaps \u2014 and then enlist the help of people who are there and others who support that institution in order to move forward together.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nI don\u2019t subscribe to the model of hero leadership, which is identifying somebody who can come in and have magical powers and then wield the wand and fix things that have not been fixable before. I don\u2019t see that. I think leadership is a community affair.\n\nM.J.: That makes sense. So how do you approach educating the current generation of students at Prairie View to lead in the way you described?\n\nR.S.: People today are fond of leadership programs that theorize about the profile and tenets of leadership. And students anxiously get involved in those programs. I rather think that our entire campuses are incubators of leadership even without the formality of such programs because if we\u2019re doing what we should be doing, we are acclimating students to an environment in which they have to learn to work with others who are very different from themselves. And that seems to me to be the first requirement of leadership. To actually learn to work with people in a respectful and inclusive way is inordinately important. A campus provides one of the best opportunities for people to be able to do that because you sit in class alongside people whom you initially don\u2019t know. You are discussing your ideas, having people respond to them and often rejecting what you\u2019re saying. You are joining organizations that have certain aims that are being advanced by the collective, so you\u2019re learning how to facilitate. You are asked to step into leadership roles either through student government or organizations. Even in the classroom context you might play a leadership role. You have to learn to express yourself, to be convincing, to write out your ideas, to be more thoughtful than you\u2019d ordinarily be. All of those things are components of leadership.\n\nM.J.: Some would argue that social media, or perhaps disagreements over the concept of safe spaces, have made it more challenging for people to come together and to work together.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: Yeah, I would say that people frequently say that, but that has certainly not been my experience. I would say that in my days as a student, the tensions were higher, the disagreements were greater, the separation among us was certainly more pronounced. And people are kind of inventing a new narrative, that things are so much worse today than they were in the past. I don\u2019t buy that. I think we have new terminology, because the modern sciences of psychology and sociology and so forth and modern media have enabled us to peer into areas that we were not able to see as easily as before. And so when you have social media and all of the ways in which people can now say whatever they want to say \u2014 in an unartful or offensive way \u2014 that turns the volume up to be sure. But it doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t there before.\n\nI would say that the current situation ought to give us much more practice in how to engage with each other because it is not underground. It\u2019s out front, it\u2019s in the open. The media today and the things that are being reported should be upsetting or troubling to students, my goodness. But it may be an even better opportunity to engage students.\n\nAs a teacher, as an educator, I would say these times are especially fertile for teaching the skills that are needed in a world in which there are many types of people, many perspectives and so forth. Students don\u2019t need to feel silenced by the current situation. When students at Brown came to me and said, you know, they were hurt because somebody asked them about their hair, and they were tired of that and they didn\u2019t want any part of it, I would say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s just too bad!\u201d Somebody asked you about your hair, tell them about your hair. You are in college not to hide from that. You\u2019re there to teach the world about yourself, you\u2019re there to learn about others and to teach them about who you are. So I\u2019d rather think this whole notion of protecting people from that is something that we have to take in hand and deal with. And help students see the opportunity in that because if they engage with people who have those kinds of perspectives, they are going to be much stronger in the end than if they run away.\n\nM.J.: Do you see the situation differently for students at H.B.C.U.s? You mentioned that Dillard gave you the space to learn and build confidence before heading to graduate school.\n\nR.S.: There is a narrative that many people have for H.B.C.U.s. People see them as a monolith, or only see them as filling a gap that exists for African-Americans. H.B.C.U.s are not a brand. They are institutions with a certain history \u2014 they were originally set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for education \u2014 but they are not all alike, and are very diverse in what they offer.\n\nPrairie View, for example, is the second-oldest public institution of higher education in the state of Texas. It was set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for ex-slaves and whites. For a long time it provided educational opportunities for black students that wouldn\u2019t have been open to them otherwise. In nursing, architecture, engineering and other STEM fields at a time when many blacks were not able to go into those areas, the university was able to facilitate the entry of blacks into those professions.\n\nM.J.: Yes, this is something that Nikole Hannah-Jones has written about for The New York Times Magazine, in particular how Xavier University of Louisiana sends more black students to medical school than almost any other college in the country. I read that Prairie View has many more students who graduate with degrees in architecture and engineering.\n\nR.S.: Yes, going to Dillard is not like going to Prairie View. So the student who chooses to go to one H.B.C.U. may not find another appealing. That has to do with the unique features of the place, the academic culture and so on, the traditions. All of that makes a big difference.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen I went off to college, I was just trying to find a place where I could be a student without impediments that in that day and time were fairly widely known to be substantial if you enrolled in a majority-white institution. There was no question that in 1963, if you went off to college in the South, you had to be very careful about where you studied. The racial dynamic was very challenging at that time. One of the things I\u2019m learning now is that many of the students I speak to at Prairie View today have the same kinds of thoughts that I had those many years ago. They ask themselves, where can I feel comfortable so that I don\u2019t have to worry about anything but my academic work? So certainly that plays a factor in why students apply to H.B.C.U.s. And for some H.B.C.U.s, applications are way up. But if you reach the point where you think that a category of institutions are the right choice for you \u2014 going to an H.B.C.U. just to go to an H.B.C.U. \u2014 then you\u2019re not thinking broadly enough.\n\nM.J.: As you look across the landscape of higher education, what other challenges do college students face today?\n\nR.S.: I guess I worry a lot about our students having the skills and the experience to promote respectful interactions with a wide-ranging group of people. Students can be quite passionate about what they see on the national scene and how sometimes dangerous they think it is \u2014 how unpleasant it is and so forth. But we\u2019ve got to try to find a way on our campuses not to taint the national picture as hopeless, or as being antithetical to anything that we can think of as good and admirable. The last thing we want is for our students to bow out and decide that it isn\u2019t worth trying to do anything about a hopeless situation.\n\nAnd I do think that civility goes hand in hand with being hopeful. Hopeful that the next person you meet you will be able to converse with you in a respectful way. Hopeful that the next election cycle is going to give you a chance to be engaged and able to do something that makes you feel a sense of your own agency. Hopeful that the things will get better rather than worse.\n\nSo much of what we have to do on our campuses is really to hold open the possibility for people that civil society will in the end right itself \u2014 if enough of us are engaged. I am so thankful every day for the fact that I grew up in a time when nobody thought blacks would be able to be integrated into American society, they would never be able to hold important positions, they\u2019d never be respected intellectually, they\u2019d never be able to do the things that they are now able to do. So why did we persist? And why did we continue to work toward betterment? We did it because we had people working with us in education who were ever hopeful that things were going to change. So I like to say to educators, you have to be always projecting to students that civility enables hopefulness to be ever resurgent.", "keywords": ["leadership", "generation", "able", "simmons", "say", "prairie", "view", "today", "college", "things", "cultivating", "ruth", "students", "dont", "think"], "polarity": 0.18839701321015756, "subjectivity": 0.47766767453623127},

They are quiet, almost too much so. But once you learn what happened in these scenes from small towns, big cities or verdant fields, their almost unemotional first impression gives way to horror: Someone was lynched there.\n\nStarting in 2016, Mr. Clasper traveled through the United States seeking the sites of lynchings. He wanted to show how places that call no attention to themselves were the sites of hangings, slashings or execution by gunfire. In the course of just 24 photos, they span 150 years, right up to the present century, and range from the American south to New York City.\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective, I take it back to 1903, when the American scholar and activist W.E.B. Du Bois said the problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line,\u201d Mr. Clasper said. \u201cIt seems to me not a lot has changed despite significant advances. There has been barely a year or generation that has passed where racism and violence have not been at the forefront of the American experience.\u201d\n\nAs the London-born son of a British mother and American father, Mr. Clasper said he had \u201ca deep spiritual connection to the American landscape.\u201d In this series \u2014 titled \u201cThe Spaces We Inherit\u201d \u2014 he hopes to gently confront viewers in a way that eschews graphic images of violence.\n\n\u201cI took a different approach and focused on the spaces to encourage people to look at this history from an altered perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve become desensitized to images of violence. But everything that happen s has to happen somewhere.\u201d\n\nGiven the persisting tensions over racial and religious prejudice, Mr. Clasper wants to gently provoke a necessary conversation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to investigate these deep-seated issues in America,\u201d he said. \u201cI think many agree that the nation has not dealt with its bloody past of lynchings and segregation. It seemed to me there has been no collective acceptance, let alone recognition of the mistakes made and the sins committed.\u201d\n\nInterviews were conducted by Oliver Clasper and have been edited for brevity.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Jesse Lee Bond, Arlington, Tenn., 1939\n\nOn April 28, 1939, a local sharecropper named Jesse Lee Bond was shot to death in broad daylight by employees of SY Wilson, a local hardware store. Jesse Lee Bond had asked for an invoice the day before after purchasing goods on credit, something that was no\u0095t done by African-Americans at that time as keeping sharecroppers in the dark about how much they had spent was one way for white owners to keep their workers in constant debt. The day of Jesse Lee Bond\u2019s murder he was ordered back to the store. His aunt accompanied him and witnessed the whole thing. \u201cThey shot at him and shot him. He ran out to the outhouse. They riddled the outhouse. And when he staggered out of the outhouse, they threw him down, castrated him, and dragged him to the river,\u0095\u201d she said. The family was told he had drowned accidentally.\n\nImage\n\nSylvester Lewis, Memphis\n\n\u201cI remember my cousin Jesse well. I was 9 when he was killed and he was 20. What I heard was that there had been a dispute at the SY Wilson general store over in Arlington. Jesse insisted on a receipt, but this is something they didn\u2019\u0095t do. I think whoever he was negotiating with relented, but I think the people over him, the father of the individual in question, didn\u2019\u0095t like it. They went to his home and said they wanted to talk to him and ordered him back to the store. When he returned they attacked him. He tried to run for his life but they caught up with him and shot him. I also heard that they dragged his body behind a vehicle and then dumped him in the river. The descendants are running the store now, and I\u2019\u0095m not sure they know what happened. The ones who were allegedly involved in the lynching passed a long time ago, but their relations are still in Arlington. I don\u2019t think there\u2019\u0095s any resentment now. Anyone who hears about it can\u2019\u0095t understand how that could happen. They simply can\u2019t relate to that kind of criminal activity.\u201d\n\nInterviewed November 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Emmett Till, Drew, Miss., 1955.\n\nIn what is one of the most significant race-related events in the history of the United States, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Chicago native, was brutally lynched in rural Mississippi on Aug. 28, 1955. Till, who had been visiting family members in the area, entered a local white-owned grocery store in the town of Money for less than one minute. Whatever was said between him and the proprietor, Carolyn Bryant, was used as the pretext for his murder. Four days later Till was abducted from his uncle\u2019\u0095s house by Roy Bryant, Carolyn\u2019\u0095s husband, and J.W. Milam and driven to a nearby barn where he was severely beaten and tortured (the original wall of the barn can be seen on the left of the photograph). He was then taken to the Tallahatchie River, shot in the head, and drowned with a cotton gin fan tied around his neck. In an infamous court case both defendants were found \u0094not guilty\u0095 by an all-white jury. Months later they sold their story and admitted their guilt, with Bryant claiming that the Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education that desegregated schools was a mistake. Emmett Till\u2019s mother, Mamie Till Bradley, allowed photos to be taken of her son\u2019s broken and swollen body because she \u201cwanted the world to see what they did to my baby.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nDr. Jeffrey Andrews, Drew, Miss.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know the history of the property when I purchased it in 2003 and it was only two years later that a few local people told me of the Emmett Till murder. I\u2019ve lived in Drew since I was 12 and I had never heard of it. I\u2019ve since modified the barn to make it more functional and useful, and someone once asked me why I would change a historical site, but history is in the past and people should move on. Things have changed drastically here in the Mississippi Delta region and race relations are at all-time high. History is an important learning tool and it should be used to help people move forward, but one thing you have to remember is that people here don\u2019t want to be constantly reminded of how things were 60 years ago. We\u2019ve all moved forward, and sometimes people aren\u2019t given enough credit for the changes we\u2019ve made. I respect everyone\u2019s feelings towards Emmett Till, and I\u2019ve met some of his family members. They\u2019re great people. This has been a learning experience for my family and we appreciate the fact that we\u2019re part of a historical site.\u201d\n\nInterviewed March 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Joe Coe, Omaha, 1891\n\nOn Oct. 10, 1891, a 50-year-old African-American named Joe Coe (also known as George Smith) was accused of sexually assaulting a 5-year-old girl and was quickly arrested. Rumors spread that the girl had died and that Coe would get off lightly, neither of which was true. A frenzied mob seized him from the jail at the Douglas County Courthouse, put a rope around his neck, and dragged his body through the streets. Coe was then hanged from a streetcar wire on the corner of 17th and Harney in front of thousands of onlookers. Souvenirs of the rope were later sold. Mayor Richard C. Cushing of Omaha condemned the lynching as \u201c\u0094the most deplorable thing that has ever happened in the history of the country.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Ell Persons, Memphis, 1917\n\nWhen the decapitated body of a 16-year-old local, Antoinette Rappel, was found near the old Wolf River Bridge in May 1917, Ell Persons, a local black woodcutter, was deemed a possible suspect. Despite being arrested and released twice, he was captured a third time and forced to confess. A local mob announced that he was to be lynched the next day. The news spread, and a crowd of 3,000 turned up to witness his lynching (including students of Central High School). Ell Persons was burned on a makeshift pyre in a carnival-like atmosphere. He was then decapitated, and his head was taken to the predominantly African-American Beale Street and thrown at locals. A century later his lynching was commemorated and a historic marker was erected near the site.\n\nImage\n\nAmal Altareb, Memphis\n\n\u201cI came to America in 2012 from Yemen. I\u2019m still learning the language and the history, and it wasn\u2019t until the spring of last year that I learned about lynchings. I knew some of the history of segregation and Jim Crow laws, and I knew how unfair the system was \u2014 that African-Americans weren\u2019t treated as equals \u2014 but I didn\u2019t know that human beings had been burned or hanged from a tree just because of their race. Last year my class at Central High School were discussing it and I asked what lynchings were and they were surprised that I didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s surprising that humans can go so far as to kill someone else in this way and create a festival-like atmosphere. There were even spectators. Uncovering the truth is painful, but it\u2019s important. The African-American students especially don\u2019t talk about it because it\u2019s painful, and it reminds them of the injustices towards their race. White Americans don\u2019t want to remember either because of the guilt they feel. I can understand why people want to avoid the topic, but we need to face history in order to move forward.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Leo Frank, Marietta, Ga., 1915\n\nMary Phagan, 13, was found dead on April 26, 1913, at a National Pencil Company factory where she worked. Amid an atmosphere of anti-Semitism and despite conflicting evidence, a Jewish superintendent named Leo Frank was convicted of the crime. Frank\u2019s sentence was later commuted from the death penalty to life imprisonment, a decision that led a mob on Aug. 17, 1915, to seize him from state prison and lynch him from a tree in Marietta, Mary Phagan\u2019s hometown. Later that year the second chapter of the Ku Klux Klan was founded on Stone Mountain, with a number of Leo Frank\u2019s murderers present. Leo Frank was posthumously pardoned in 1986.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of George W. Murray, Mae Murray Dorsey, Roger Malcom and Dorothy Malcolm, Walton County, Georgia, 1946\n\nAfter Roger Malcom, a World War II veteran and Georgia sharecropper, had been bailed out of jail after allegedly stabbing a white man, members of the local community decided to take revenge. On July 25, 1946, a mob of 15 to 20 stopped the car Malcom was riding in with his wife, Dorothy, and another couple, George W. Murray and Mae Murray Dorsey, who was pregnant. They tied the four of them to a nearby tree and shot them to death. Mae Murray Dorsey then had her unborn baby ripped out of her. Despite an F.B.I. investigation nobody was brought to trial for the crime, and a few months later a grand jury was \u201cunable to establish the identity of any persons guilty of violating the civil rights statute of the United States.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nCeleste Butler, Omaha\n\n\u201cTracing one\u2019s roots and one\u2019s history is hard, especially as an African-American. These are big questions we all want to know: Who are we and where do we come from? I had DNA testing done recently but it didn\u2019t lead anywhere. It just told me that my ancestors came from West Africa, but it couldn\u2019t say where exactly. Missing that part and not being able to hand it down to my children or grandchildren is frustrating. On top of that you hear some people in this country telling black people to \u2018go back home.\u2019 Home to what? Home to whom? It feels like a total assault both mentally and physically to have chapters and generations missing. Not being able to fill that void is difficult. When it comes to racial violence I feel like we\u2019re constantly suffering from PTSD. It\u2019s a stress that never really goes away. A lot of people suffer in pain and in silence, and they suffer for successive generations. Everything was stripped from us, and we\u2019ve been struggling to put the pieces back together ever since.\u201d\n\nInterviewed September 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Michael Donald, Mobile, Ala., 1981\n\nMichael Donald, 19, was abducted on March 21, 1981, by Henry Hays and James Knowles as he was walking home. They beat him, slit his throat, and hanged his body from a tree outside 114 Herndon Avenue. The pretext for Donald\u2019s murder was a \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict handed down by a partially black jury to an African-American man accused of killing a white police officer. This incensed the Alabama chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, led by Benny Jack Hays, the father of Henry Hays, who suggested killing a random black person in response. Michael Donald\u2019s mother, Beulah Mae Donald, with the help of the Southern Poverty Law Center, brought a case not just against the killers but also the United Klans of America. Beulah Mae Donald won the case and received $7 million in damages, essentially bankrupting the U.K.A. Henry Hays was executed, while Knowles received life imprisonment. Hays is the only known Klan member to have been executed in the 20th century for the murder of an African-American. Herndon Avenue has since been renamed Michael Donald Avenue and a historic marker has been erected.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Mulugeta Seraw, Portland, Ore., 1988\n\nOn the evening of Nov. 13, 1988, an Ethiopian student named Mulugeta Seraw was being dropped off at his apartment when he was attacked by Kenneth Mieske, Kyle Brewster and Steve Strasser, members of a local racist skinhead group called East Side White Pride. Mieske delivered the fatal blows with a baseball bat. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 1990 Seraw\u2019s family, represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, brought a civil lawsuit against the killers\u2019 affiliated group, the White Aryan Nation, and its leaders, Tom and John Metzger, for $12.5 million. Tom Metzger later said that the killers had done their \u201ccivic duty\u201d by killing Seraw.\n\nImage\n\nJason Downard, Portland, Ore.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 2 I was put into foster care, and in 2009 I went to prison for a gang-affiliated drive-by shooting. I didn\u2019t grow up racist, but in prison the racist skinheads pulled me into their group and drilled stuff into my head about how the media is run by Jews and that they wanted an all-white nation. I also got a tattoo of a swastika on my leg, which I\u2019ve since had covered up. It\u2019s a painful reminder. The skinheads showed me support and love and compassion, which I hadn\u2019t experienced before in my life; everyone is looking for some kind of acceptance. I was angry and uncomfortable with who I was, and I drove that anger towards people who didn\u2019t look like me. In the last two years of the movement my sister had a son with a black guy and my nephew would give me this look like he knew what I was about. I started to get a guilty conscience and began to think about the things I thought I believed in. My sister said I\u2019d been brainwashed, and I can see why. The movement just taught me to hate and reinforced those views. The problem of racism in this country is much deeper than many people think. When it comes to Trump, he\u2019s tacitly endorsed the alt-right and white supremacists. It\u2019s been a ripple effect and things have gotten worse since he came into power. The right now feel emboldened. I look back now at some of the things I\u2019ve done and I realize that I\u2019ve hurt a lot of people. I decided I wanted to help others who had been in a similar position to me, and that\u2019s been my mission ever since. Now I work for an organization called Life After Hate. I\u2019m a marked man, and maybe I\u2019ll die doing this, but at least I\u2019ll die knowing I did the right thing.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Murder Site of Timothy Caughman, New York City, 2017\n\nOn March 17, 2017 James Harris Jackson traveled from his home in Baltimore to New York City with the intention of killing random black men. The reason, he later told police, was his hatred of interracial relationships. Three days later he found Timothy Caughman, 66, collecting cans in a trash bin on the corner of West 36th and 9th Avenue and stabbed him multiple times with an 18-inch sword. Caughman died of his injuries that night, and two days later Jackson turned himself in, telling police that he had planned to kill more black men in Times Square. On March 27, Jackson was charged with one count each of murder in the first and second degrees as an act of terrorism, second-degree murder as a hate crime, and three counts of criminal possession of a weapon.\n\n\u201cThe Spaces We Inherit,\u201d which will be published as a book by Overlapse in October 2018, is available for pre-order.\n\nFollow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

Though his inquiry is intensely, at times painfully personal, Mr. Wilkerson is above all concerned with unpacking the mechanisms of racial domination. The procedure is akin to performing surgery on a half-conscious subject, or digging up a buried land mine that has lost little of its explosive power.\n\nVideo\n\nThe focus of his excavation is a killing that took place in Dothan, Ala., in 1946, when S.E. Branch, a white shopkeeper, shot Bill Spann, a black man who was in his store. Branch, Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s great-grandfather, was charged with first-degree murder, but no trial was ever held, and the crime faded from memory. Or rather, the memory of it was quietly and systematically suppressed. All that remains are a short newspaper article and a few photographs and home movies of the killer.\n\n\u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d proceeds on several parallel tracks. Mr. Wilkerson returns to Alabama and tries to discover both how Bill Spann died and how he was forgotten. His investigation, accompanied by haunting images of Southern back roads and quiet houses, is punctuated by reminders that Bill Spann\u2019s death is hardly a unique or anomalous event. The names of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and other recent victims of racist violence appear onscreen, and two songs of protest loop into the soundtrack: Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s \u201cHell You Talmbout\u201d and Phil Ochs\u2019s \u201cWilliam Moore.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat song, about a white postal worker and civil rights activist murdered on an Alabama highway in 1963, is the source of the film\u2019s title and a part of its wider cultural context. \u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d is a passionately political film, aflame with rage in spite of its director\u2019s measured, ruminative tone of voice. It is also a horror movie, full of specters and silences and a terror that is pervasive, intimate and elusive.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Wilkerson, whose previous films include \u201cAn Injury to One\u201d and \u201cFar From Afghanistan,\u201d dispenses with many of the usual techniques of historical documentary. There are a few on-camera interviews, with neighbors and relatives, but more frequently Mr. Wilkerson narrates encounters that took place off camera. And his sleuthing often leads not to moments of revelation but to dead ends and deeper mysteries. The insertion of clips from \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d provides a chilling and ironic counterpoint to the grim story this movie is telling. S.E. Branch is the opposite of Gregory Peck\u2019s brave and decent Atticus Finch, and the truth about what happened to Bill Spann resists the kind of redemptive, healing conclusion that remains a cornerstone of American racial fantasy.\n\nInstead of consolation, Mr. Wilkerson offers commitment. Instead of idealism, honesty. He doesn\u2019t suppose that his film will solve anything, but there is nonetheless something profoundly useful about the way he confronts past and present manifestations of white supremacy. He links his great-grandfather\u2019s crime to the contemporaneous gang rape of Recy Taylor (the subject of an excellent recent documentary by Nancy Buirski), and uncovers patterns of abuse within his family. He corresponds with a relative who is part of a white nationalist, \u201cSouthern secessionist\u201d group. He notes the way racial injustice dwells in apparently mundane facts. The killer is immortalized in pictures and a well-kept tombstone. His victim has been almost entirely erased from memory, a kind of second death beyond the reach of redress or revenge.", "keywords": ["white", "supremacy", "movie", "wonder", "bill", "memory", "mr", "fired", "spann", "reckons", "review", "racial", "wilkerson", "gun"], "polarity": 0.04540441176470589, "subjectivity": 0.3202205882352941},

But it\u2019s also a powerful place, and a friendly one for travelers. Image Scenes from Montgomery. Clockwise from top right: Students examine the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Civil Rights Memorial, designed by Maya Lin; a Nat King Cole mural on Maxwell Boulevard near downtown, by the artists Sunny Paulk and Corey Spearman; culinary students Sheldon Warren, Steven McIntyre and Felicia Houston hang out at Aviator Bar after work; the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church, where Dr. King preached. Credit Jada Yuan/The New York Times\n\nDriving by the Alabama State Capitol building in Montgomery, Michelle Browder, an African-American activist and founder of the I Am More Than... youth mentorship nonprofit, pointed out a looming bronze statue of Jefferson Davis, the first and only president of the Confederacy. It has a position of prominence right out front, as does a commemorative plaque on the marble steps marking the exact spot where he stood taking his oath of office in 1861. A state holiday recognizes his birthday. Farther down the Capitol lawn, Ms. Browder said, was a similar statue heralding Dr. J. Marion Sims, but I didn\u2019t recognize the name, and she wouldn\u2019t elaborate. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to do your homework on that one,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause my blood pressure goes up when I talk about him.\u201d\n\nMs. Browder wore red cat-eye glasses, an Army-green jacket, and a T-shirt bearing the words \u201cDream Destroyed\u201d and the face of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who began leading the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955 from the basement of a Baptist church just 440 feet from those Capitol steps. The vehicle she was careening through downtown, often parking akimbo on sidewalks or in the middle of the street, was a six-seat electric cart, from which she leads More Than Tours \u2014 explorations of a city that has been both the site of systemic oppression of her fellow African-Americans and the birthplace of the civil rights movement.\n\nWithin about 10 seconds, she\u2019d risked that blood pressure spike to tell me about Sims. \u201cHe\u2019s known as the father of modern gynecology,\u201d she said. \u201cHe enslaved black women and he used them as experiments.\u201d Specifically, he visited unimaginable tortures on 12 slave women, without anesthesia, under the belief that black people felt less than whites. \u201cWe are starting an initiative,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause we would like to see the mothers of gynecology erected beside him to give more to the story.\u201d The \u201cwe\u201d she refers to is a group she\u2019s organized called Friends of Anarcha, after a woman who endured 30 of Sims\u2019s vaginal surgeries before he declared her a success.\n\nMontgomery was my third stop on an insane yearlong mission I\u2019ve undertaken to visit every spot on The Times\u2019 52 Places to Go in 2018 list, and I was eager to find out why the city had snagged the No. 49 slot. By the end of four days, I\u2019d come to believe it should have ranked higher. As a tourist destination, Montgomery is \u2014 how shall I put this \u2014 heavy. In the same afternoon, visitors can see the Rosa Parks Museum, built at the site of her 1955 arrest for refusing to give up her seat to a white person, and the first White House of the Confederacy, a National Historic Landmark. (Ms. Browder is a descendant of Aurelia Browder, a woman who faced a similar arrest eight months before Parks, and who was the lead plaintiff in the 1956 lawsuit, Browder v. Gayle, that ended the bus boycott.)\n\nThe city is also undeniably relevant right now, with a deep commitment to confronting its past (and often present) of racism, at a time when white supremacism has re-entered the national conversation in a major way. Daily, I found myself moved to tears by any number of tales of brutality or hardship, and the strength it took to tell them. Even the trees that line the streets, dripping with Spanish moss like bearded old men, seem embedded with pain.\n\nI\u2019d arrived in MGM, as residents call it, less than two months after national news outlets had swarmed its streets to document the contentious Senate race in which Doug Jones, a Democrat, defeated Roy S. Moore, the Republican who had been accused of harassing and assaulting teenage girls. \u201cHis office is right there!\u201d Ms. Browder said, pointing to the windows of Mr. Moore\u2019s Foundation for Moral Law, in a building that once housed the bank that funded the Confederacy.\n\nImage A rendering of the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, scheduled to open on April 26. Credit Equal Justice Initiative\n\nWhat really ought to bump Montgomery up the 52 Places list is the National Memorial for Peace and Justice that the Equal Justice Initiative, a human rights legal nonprofit, is scheduled to open on April 26. Inspired by the memorials that Germany, Rwanda and South Africa have built to the atrocities of their own pasts, it pays tribute to the approximately 4,400 black victims of lynching by white mobs in the United States from 1877 to 1950, and is the country\u2019s first comprehensive memorial to racial terrorism.\n\nThe six-acre site and an accompanying museum that aims to link slavery to mass incarceration were under construction when I visited, but plans show it will consist of 800 rectangular, oxidized steel columns, each representing a particular county in the Deep South and Midwest, and bearing the names of the men, women and children killed there. While the columns will appear at first glance to touch the ground, the floor of the memorial will actually slope downward as visitors walk through it, allowing for the columns to hang over them, like bodies.\n\nThe Initiative\u2019s project is in many ways a companion piece to the work that the Southern Poverty Law Center, the nation\u2019s top legal advocate for victims of hate crimes, began in Montgomery with the Civil Rights Memorial in 1989. The memorial, designed by Maya Lin, consists of a stone table overflowing with water, bearing the names of 40 people who were murdered while doing things as simple as registering black people to vote. (A Civil Rights Memorial Center was added in 2005.)\n\nUpon first impression, even with a county population of 230,000, Montgomery seems far too quaint and conservative to be home to two of the country\u2019s most influential, progressive nonprofits fighting racial bias. Its airport has a single baggage claim and the rental car area is dotted with wooden rocking chairs, for an extra dose of Southern charm. I spent 20 minutes answering emails before walking outside and found myself the only person left on the premises, other than three bored-seeming policemen trading stories on the sidewalk.\n\n\u201cYou need a taxi, ma\u2019am?\u201d one of them asked. \u201cHe just left, so it\u2019s going to be 15 or 20 minutes.\u201d \u201cNow, where\u2019s my taxi driver?\u201d the officer mumbled to himself, then got on the radio: \u201cNick, there\u2019s a lady waiting for you.\u201d It took me a minute to absorb what I was hearing, but yes, apparently there was only one taxi driver working in Montgomery on Super Bowl Sunday.\n\nI\u2019d encountered a similar peculiarity earlier that morning, when I\u2019d made a last minute online reservation at a lovely bed-and-breakfast, Red Bluff Cottage, only to receive a distressed call from the owner, Bonnie Ponstein, wondering what time, exactly, I was planning to arrive. She, her husband and their usual housekeeper would all be at church.\n\nThat evening, I went to the city\u2019s historic downtown for an informal tour with an enterprising Lyft driver, Marcus McNeal. We stood talking in the middle of those cobblestone streets for what must have been 30 minutes before another car, or even another person, came by. \u201cYou could shoot a cannon down Dexter Avenue\u201d \u2014 downtown\u2019s main drag \u2014 \u201cand not hit a person on a Sunday,\u201d Barry Ponstein, Bonnie\u2019s husband told me later. \u201cEveryone\u2019s at church.\u201d\n\nThe one person we did meet out and about, actually, was Brother Ricky Segers, whom we found deep into a nightly ritual he\u2019s kept up for three years, of kneeling in front of a tiny souvenir American flag he\u2019s planted on the Capitol grounds to ask Jesus for more \u201cgodly\u201d leaders in this country. He feels as though Roy Moore was \u201cmistreated\u201d and Robert E. Lee was a hero. Still, he and Mr. McNeal, the Lyft driver, who is black and at least half his age, have known each other for a while now and seem to get along great.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to me, too,\u201d said Mr. McNeal of their friendliness. He\u2019s 24, hopes to open a chain of 24-hour coffee shops for workaholics, and comes from what he described as abject poverty. The car he drove me in belongs to his mother, who has been pulling double shifts as a nurse\u2019s assistant to pay for their heating bill that had gone from $80 to $480 during a cold spell that preceded my visit.\n\n\u201cMy mom is 62 years old and she makes $8 an hour, and that\u2019s the most she\u2019s ever made,\u201d he said. Their all-wood house has too much dry rot for them to install insulation, and they haven\u2019t been able to afford replacing the bathroom sink that fell out of their wall. \u201cIt\u2019s O.K.,\u201d he said. \u201cPoverty is a mind-set. If you change your mind-set, you\u2019re going to come out of it eventually.\u201d Later, he declared, \u201cCome back and see me when I have my Bentley.\u201d\n\nThe ad hoc tour Mr. McNeal took me on had been refreshingly frank. He drove straight to a historical placard describing the bustling slave markets that had been held at Court Square, the city\u2019s central roundabout. I asked Mr. McNeal why it didn\u2019t have more central placement in the square and he just laughed: \u201cWhat else are they going to do? It\u2019s not like they can build an auction platform here. That would really piss some people off!\u201d\n\nWhen I mentioned to him that multiple people had suggested I eat at Central, an upscale Southern food restaurant in downtown\u2019s tiny revitalized commercial district, he joked, \u201cCentral is so expensive, you\u2019d be better off buying a restaurant and opening and stocking the kitchen yourself.\u201d We went to Applebee\u2019s instead, and gorged on spinach and artichoke dip.\n\nI did end up at Central on another night, and it was indeed quite good \u2014 part of a growing culinary scene that will include gourmet offerings at the renovated Kress on Dexter building downtown, which opens in April. The former block-wide department store, built in 1929, will host rotating pop-up markets devoted to local artists \u2014 and has been engaged in incredibly responsible historical preservation, which has included donating bricks made by enslaved people to EJI \u2014 as well as keep its old \u201cWhites Only\u201d and \u201cColored Only\u201d signs on display for posterity. I\u2019m also a fan of the coffee shops Prevail Union and Cafe Louisa, as well as bar standouts like Leroy Lounge, a dive with a terrific selection of wines and craft beers, and Aviator Bar, covered in airplane-themed kitsch \u2014 inspired by the Wright Brothers, who started the country\u2019s first civilian flight school outside Montgomery.\n\nI met a group of black culinary students there one night who not only knew the city\u2019s history but said it fueled their ambitions. \u201cWe\u2019re in a bar on the road that was used to bring people to be auctioned off,\u201d said Steven McIntyre, who interns as a line cook at the highly regarded restaurant Vintage Year, \u201cand the fact that we are here today, just hanging out, enjoying life, it\u2019s incredible. Not super long ago, we would not be chilling here. This would not be chill.\u201d\n\nMy best culinary experiences, though, came by way of cabdrivers I\u2019d met. Nick Alloway, that lone Sunday driver, sent me to Mrs. B\u2019s Home Cooking, a yellow-painted soul food restaurant a few minutes west of downtown that serves up a different featured meat every day. Blocks north of the Capitol building is Davis Cafe, an even older family-run soul food joint that\u2019s the haunt of Hillard Wright, a King\u2019s Airport shuttle driver with a salt-and-pepper mustache, a gruff baritone voice and a leather rancher\u2019s hat that never left his head. He spent a whole afternoon showing me his version of the city he\u2019s lived in all of his 66 years. State senators were crowded into every vinyl booth. My plate overflowing with collard greens, creamed corn, peas and okra, turkey dressing, yams and cornbread cost around $6.\n\nFollowing the spirit of the locals I had met, I tried to absorb as much history as I could in four days: The Dexter Parsonage Museum, where Dr. King lived in the 1950s; the F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald Museum in the home where their marriage dissolved; Hank Williams\u2019s grave in the Oakwood Annex Cemetery. What stuck with me more than any of those, though, were the three hours I spent with Mr. Wright, engaging in his favorite pastime of driving around and looking at old houses. He\u2019d introduce each neighborhood with factoids about its legal, and later, de facto, segregation status. Entering the \u201cold money\u201d neighborhood of Old Cloverdale, for example, he pointed out, \u201cif you\u2019ll notice, you don\u2019t see any black folks living in there.\u201d I did notice.\n\nMr. Wright, though, is not bitter. He has built for himself a quiet life of hunting and fishing, driving around for money and minding his own business. \u201cEven through the segregation and hatred,\u201d he said, \u201cMontgomery, I wouldn\u2019t trade it. I\u2019ve been here my whole life and I\u2019ve enjoyed every day.\u201d\n\nThis year, the city will erect its first statue to Dr. King, in front of the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church where he used to preach near the Capitol. The statues of J. Marion Sims and Jefferson Davis, erected in 1939 and 1940, will be in view, too. Alabama will remain one of two states that celebrate the King and Lee birthdays in a combined holiday. This is how change seems to come in Montgomery: messy and long overdue. Still, how wonderful to see progress in action.\n\nJada Yuan will be traveling to every place on this year\u2019s 52 Places to Go list. Her next dispatch will be from Disney Springs, Fla.

Does it bother you, that designation?\n\nWe were making fun of my persona. I\u2019m not a household name like Brad Pitt. People like to have labels for actors, and the truth is, every actor is a character actor. When I say actor, I mean actresses as well. Toni Collette is a good example of someone who can do both leading lady and transformational characters, where you\u2019re barely recognizing them. I think Billy Crudup, Chris Walken, Robert De Niro, they\u2019re all great examples of that.\n\nPeople often use the word \u201cquirky\u201d to describe your characters.

I can relate to self-loathing. The reason a person lashes out the way Dixon does is because he hates himself, so anybody can relate to that. I\u2019m drawn to complex characters; they\u2019re all filled with so many different feelings, and that\u2019s what makes them interesting. The first \u201cIron Man,\u201d Tony Stark, was an interesting character. He drinks too much, he\u2019s a womanizer, and then he has this epiphany. That\u2019s what\u2019s interesting.\n\nWhat do you think it was about this role, and this film, that led to so many awards?\n\nIt\u2019s the transformational aspect of it, the fact that he was really many different roles wrapped up in one role. He\u2019s a doofus, he\u2019s a racist, he\u2019s violent, he\u2019s a mama\u2019s boy. There\u2019s a few heroic things at certain points. But he\u2019s very flawed, and it\u2019s a boy-to-man journey.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere\u2019s been criticism that your character got away scot-free for his racist behavior and for throwing a guy out the window, and never being brought to justice.\n\nIt\u2019s a small town and, who knows, in real life maybe he would have gotten thrown in prison. It\u2019s a sort of dark fairy tale in certain ways \u2014 it\u2019s not necessarily meant to be completely realistic. And if it is meant to be realistic, in real life, things aren\u2019t tied up in a bow. People who deserve to get punished don\u2019t necessarily get punished.\n\nDid it surprise you that there was criticism of the movie along these lines?\n\nNo, whenever a movie is popular and it is a complex dramatic story, I think it\u2019s going to stir up a lot of feelings. A lot of good stuff come out of it \u2014 the billboards that have been popping up [activists recreated versions of the billboards in Miami and London]. That\u2019s kind of incredible, when a movie can effect social change, that\u2019s kind of astounding. I think Mildred [the film\u2019s mother, played by Frances McDormand, who is seeking justice in the murder of her daughter] is a really beautiful working-class wonder woman in some ways. It\u2019s a kind of antihero slash protagonist thing that I think women really need right now. Mildred and [the directors] Greta Gerwig and Patty Jenkins. It\u2019s been an incredibly vibrant year.\n\nYou\u2019re a really good dancer \u2014 you can really bust a move. You did the splits on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d How did that come about? Is it self-taught?\n\nIt\u2019s a long story, but I hung out with a certain crowd, and it was a way to meet girls.\n\nWhat kind of certain crowd?\n\nSan Francisco is not all cable cars and Rice-A-Roni. There were some tough kids there. When I was in middle school, there was a more white supremacist kind of group I didn\u2019t get along with. I got in a lot of fights with them and didn\u2019t win a lot of those fights. I didn\u2019t get along with the rich kids, people we called WPODs: white punks on dope. My school was interracial, and I met a cool group of friends who introduced me to some other friends. I used to do really bad break dancing, when \u201cThriller\u201d and \u201cPurple Rain\u201d came out. I was into Run-DMC, Grandmaster Flash, Doug E. Fresh, Eric B. & Rakim. Probably my biggest inspiration was James Brown, and watching Tom Cruise in \u201cRisky Business.\u201d I remember practicing that, and watching James Brown do the splits. I [recently] did SoulCycle, I\u2019m not proud to say, and Usher was next to me. I thought I had rhythm until I was on a bicycle next to Usher. This is what happens when you go to spinning class in Hollywood.\n\nWere you intimidated working with Frances McDormand?\n\nI think it\u2019s the biggest compliment to Frances that people are asking, \u201cWere you intimidated by her?\u201d Not really, but I was nervous to get in the ring with a great actor. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of great actors. She\u2019s really a force. I think what\u2019s great about her is her integrity. Her sense of truth is like an iron bar. All these people \u2014 Woody [Harrelson, a co-star], Martin [McDonagh, the film\u2019s writer-director], Frances \u2014 are true anarchists, they really are. I think it comes through in their work. I\u2019m not exactly conventional either.\n\nSo your dad posted a comment on that New York Times essay criticizing the film \u2014 he defended you. Was it definitely your dad?\n\nYes that was my father. I didn\u2019t read the article, but they read that quote to me on the Jimmy Kimmel show. That was my dad being a supportive father.

While it may not be a common vantage point, the narrative is a natural one for Marilyn Stern, a photographer and graphic artist who is a member of the Metropolitan Postcard Club of New York City.\n\nNot surprisingly, the vast majority of postcards that feature black people in the United States from the 19th and 20th centuries were very racist, she said.\n\n\u201cI was so sick of seeing these horrible racist stereotypes,\u201d said Ms. Stern, a collector since the mid-1970s. \u201cWhenever I came across something that was not racist or not stereotypical, or even went so far as showing romance between the races, I wanted to save it and collect it.\u201d\n\nHer collection, which numbers about 3,000, has about 300 postcards that depict African-American life in all lights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for us to fathom how isolated people were, especially in rural areas and isolated small towns before there were telephones and radios,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were postal deliveries three times a day, so it was the internet of the early 1900s.\u201d\n\nPostcards had better printing technology than magazines and newspapers did at the time, as the burst of color in the selection below shows. They could show racism with clarity. \u201cThe idea that you could see images so realistic blew people away,\u201d she said.\n\nMany of the racist postcards were a form of propaganda, she said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to see how racism was manifested in the past,\u201d she said, \u201cperhaps to better fight it in the present. You can recognize something if you\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d\n\nBelow is a selection from Ms. Stern\u2019s collection with descriptions based on her research.\n\nTrade Cards\n\nImage\n\nAfrican-Americans were often subjects \u2014 and targets \u2014 of advertising cards that were issued before 1900. These cards were frequently given away in products, or with the purchase of a product.\n\nAbove, an advertisement for J & P Coats thread. Below, a country doctor dispensing Ayer\u2019s Cathartic Pills.\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk, a dance created by plantation slaves as a satire of Southern white society, was the focus of these cards, which featured two black children and an African-American troupe that toured Europe in the late 1800s and early 1900s.\n\nRacist Cards\n\nImage\n\nThe card on the left was shot in a professional studio, but it was labeled \u201cHer Country Cousins.\u201d The implication was that no matter how refined, educated or successful black Americans became, they were still basically savages, Ms. Stern said.\n\nThe two cards on the right were produced in 1905 in New York on the common theme of the delivery stork. The first one, with the caption \u201cComparing Notes,\u201d shows both a black baby and a white baby, with no apparent bias. The second one shows two black babies with the slogan \u201cNo Race Suicide,\u201d implying that a high black birthrate threatened white supremacy, she said.\n\n\u201cLovers of All Nations\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThis postcard was from a series mailed in 1908 that was called \u201cLovers of All Nations.\u201d The banjo was a racial stereotype, but the card is in the non-discriminating \u201cFamily of Man\u201d tradition.\n\nMemories of Slavery\n\nImage\n\nPostcards once served as documentary photography. Some cards honored older African-Americans of the South, who were living memories of slavery. This was part of a series, and it was mailed in 1906.\n\nLife in the Jim Crow South\n\nImage\n\nA fortuneteller with white clients, mailed in 1908.\n\nHoliday Greetings\n\nImage\n\nIdealized country life, in a card mailed in 1907, as Americans flocked to cities.\n\nReligion\n\nImage\n\nA card, likely from the early 1950s, urging parishioners to come to church.\n\nReal Photos\n\nImage\n\nAn unidentified young woman in her graduation cap and gown, in a studio portrait taken between the 1920s and \u201940s. Cards labeled \u201cReal Photo Postcards\u201d are set apart from commercially printed postcards and are actual photographs printed on photographic paper with a preprinted postcard back.\n\nAchievement\n\nImage\n\nThe many important contributions that African-Americans made to society were rarely acknowledged in older postcards, but an exception was made for the scientist and educator George Washington Carver.\n\nHis experiments with peanuts, sweet potatoes and other crops contributed greatly to the economy of the South. This card \u2014 from a photo shot on Kodachrome or Ektachrome film \u2014 is from the late 1950s to mid-60s.\n\nFor more, see Ms. Stern\u2019s postcard blog, and a review of the film Through a Lens Darkly that deals with African-American representation in postcards and photography.

A graduate of Nascar\u2019s Drive for Diversity program, Darrell Wallace Jr., 24, could give stock car racing something it has never had before: an African-American star.\n\nBut that is not why Richard Petty brought Wallace onto his team. Late last season, Wallace, who goes by the nickname Bubba, got four rides with Richard Petty Motorsports. It was enough for Petty, one of Nascar\u2019s most iconic names, to not only give Wallace a full-time ride, but also to give him his famed No. 43 racecar to drive. Wallace is the first African-American to drive full-time in the top Nascar series since Wendell Scott in 1971.\n\nPetty insisted, though, that he is colorblind when it comes to evaluating talent. Sure, it would be great if Wallace brings the sport into the African-American community, but as far as Petty is concerned, that\u2019s secondary.\n\n\u201cI hope he advances us as a race team,\u201d Petty said in an email. \u201cI care about what Bubba can do behind the wheel for us.

Just keep your head down and keep moving, that\u2019s the best you can do.\u201d\n\nBlaney, his closest friend on the circuit, has been around Wallace when offensive remarks have been made.\n\n\u201cThankfully, it\u2019s very, very rare, but it upsets me,\u201d Blaney said. \u201cBubba\u2019s great at handling it. He\u2019s an amazing ambassador for the sport. And he\u2019s really talented and a heck of a competitor. All of us are competitive, but his competitiveness is unlike anyone I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nNascar\u2019s diversity has become an issue again after its only female racer, Danica Patrick, announced she will retire from the circuit after the Daytona 500. But Wallace is not the only driver who can energize an overlooked community. What he can do for an African-American audience, Su\u00e1rez can do for the Latino market. A native of Monterrey, Mexico, Su\u00e1rez said he had noticed an uptick in social media messages from a variety of Latino countries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually either people who tell me they\u2019re now following the sport because of me, or they\u2019ve been fans and now they have a driver to root for,\u201d said Su\u00e1rez, who is also a graduate of the Drive for Diversity program. \u201cThe potential is huge. This is the most diverse country in the world, but we have to improve diversity in Nascar. If we can make the sport more diverse, we\u2019ll see the same thing with fans. More diversity on the racetrack will mean more diversity in the stands.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Nascar waits, wondering who will emerge as its next star.", "keywords": ["leader", "generation", "waits", "drive", "nascar", "su\u00e1rez", "diversity", "hes", "petty", "racing", "sport", "wallace", "africanamerican", "emerge"], "polarity": 0.13599389129389128, "subjectivity": 0.4590651755651755},

He became senior editor there in 1958 and later executive editor. He worked for the magazine into his 80s.\n\n\u201cBefore the Mayflower\u201d established Mr. Bennett as a leading scholarly voice during the racial ferment of the 1960s.

Townships have gotten electricity and more modern housing. Government contracts have been set aside for black would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nThese programs have had an impact, improving material conditions and generating jobs.\n\nThey have also been riddled with corruption.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt local governments across South Africa, bureaucrats have abused their authority to steer contracts to companies that put cash in their pockets. At every level of society, people have grown accustomed to kickbacks and political connections determining who prospers, and who goes without.\n\nMr. Zuma\u2019s demise resonates as a sign of a potential new order taking shape. He will forever be linked to his association with the Guptas, three Indian-born brothers who effectively bought key levers of governmental power, amassing influence so comprehensive that it became known as \u201cstate capture.\u201d\n\nHis resignation has raised hopes that South Africa is finally contending with its epidemic of corruption. That view gained momentum when an elite police unit raided a home belonging to the Guptas nearly at the same moment that Mr. Ramaphosa was assuming office.\n\nThe new president is a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle, a former deputy president and chairman of the National Planning Commission, a focal point for thinking about how to engineer economic growth. As a former trade union leader and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Mandela, he enjoys credibility among a range of interest groups, while carrying a reputation as a savvy and strategic operator.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe has had his brushes with controversy, most notably after a 2012 police massacre of striking platinum miners that killed 34 people. At the time, Mr. Ramaphosa occupied a seat on the board of Lonmin, the company that owned the mine. Emails soon surfaced showing that, a day before the police opened fire, Mr. Ramaphosa had been urging senior government officials to take strong action to end the strike.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, no corruption charges have stuck to the new president, who now claims a mandate to clean up the toxic mess left behind by Mr. Zuma.\n\nSome doubt whether the A.N.C. can be salvaged as an effective vehicle for egalitarian policymaking. The party\u2019s executive ranks include many figures implicated in corruption. Mr. Ramaphosa, 65, may champion new initiatives aimed at generating economic growth, yet he finds himself relying on his party brethren to execute his visions, with no certainty that the money will land where intended.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think that taking the president out does much to dismantle the patronage network,\u201d said Ayabonga Cawe, a development economist at Xesibe Holdings, a research and advisory firm in Johannesburg. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need a lot more than taking out the guy at the top.\u201d\n\nAbove all, Mr. Ramaphosa must contend with the structural defects that have long constrained South Africa\u2019s economy, a legacy of apartheid.\n\nBeyond its systemic discrimination against black people, apartheid severed the country from much of the global economy. It ensured that huge numbers of uneducated black South Africans were available at poverty-level wages within major sectors of the economy like mining, agriculture and textiles. That cushioned domestic companies from the pressure to modernize.\n\nPhoto\n\nInternational sanctions isolated South Africa, shielding its firms from competition against multinational rivals. Sanctions also denied South African companies the ability to operate abroad, giving them an incentive to focus on the domestic market. The apartheid-era government obliged with subsidies for favored firms while allowing companies to pursue oligopoly, free of nuisances like antitrust law.\n\nThe result was a system in which large industries, from retail to furniture-making to chemicals, were dominated by huge enterprises whose core strength was the ability to protect themselves against competition. That system has largely prevailed, with smaller companies and start-ups facing often-impossible odds.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cApartheid was a system that lends itself to large conglomerates and concentrations of wealth in the hands of a few,\u201d Mr. Cawe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the corruption. It\u2019s about all of these parallel networks in big business that you need to dismantle. Most of those are white.\u201d\n\nHere is a world that Mr. Ramaphosa knows keenly, having achieved extraordinary affluence by running South African companies with interests in mining, banking, real estate and telecommunications. His fortune has been estimated at $450 million.\n\nIf he is serious about reinvigorating the economy and creating a space for black-owned small businesses, he will need to take on the prevailing structure that made him so wealthy.\n\nHis success on that front may be even more decisive than whether he can tame corruption.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly the most optimistic moment for South Africa in a very long time,\u201d said Mr. Goldin, the former adviser to Mr. Mandela. \u201cIn a way, it does feel like a new beginning.

The aggressive pace of deportations of immigrants of color, the elimination of the DACA program protecting immigrant children and the proposals propounded by the anti-immigration voices in the administration will all have the undeniable effect of slowing the rapid racial diversification of the United States population. Despite this sweeping attempt at racial social engineering, few voices in progressive and Democratic circles are responding with the kinds of outrage that one would expect.\n\nThe pro-white preferences of Donald Trump and his administration, especially when it comes to immigration, are legion. From the day he opened his presidential campaign in 2015 by demonizing Mexicans to the enthusiasm generated by the calls for building a wall along the Mexican border to aggressively ramping up deportations of immigrants of color to eliminating DACA to vulgarly denigrating African nations and Haiti, this administration has been quite clear about its preference for white people.\n\nIt should be no surprise, then, that the immigration policies championed by the White House would all have the effect of reducing the number of people of color coming into the country. A recent study by The Washington Post found that the administration\u2019s proposals to curtail legal immigration by limiting family reunification would slightly delay the date when whites become a minority. \u201cBy greatly slashing the number of Hispanic and black African immigrants entering America, this proposal would reshape the future United States,\u201d the economist Michael Clemens said.\n\n\u201cDecades ahead,\u201d he added, \u201cmany fewer of us would be nonwhite or have nonwhite people in our families.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe administration\u2019s focus is not random.

The very first immigration law passed, the Naturalization Act of 1790, declared that to become a citizen, one had to be a \u201cfree white person.\u201d That demarcation was the explicit law of the land for the next 162 years, until 1952. There are 20th-century Supreme Court cases explicitly holding that Asian immigrants could not become United States citizens because they were not white. Even after 1952, the practical effect of immigration policy continued to promote white people above others through mechanisms such as the Asia Pacific Triangle, which restricted immigration from Asian countries.", "keywords": ["white", "effect", "america", "united", "trump", "nonwhite", "color", "immigrants", "states", "immigration", "sign", "wants", "population"], "polarity": 0.07678771845438513, "subjectivity": 0.2882194965528299},

Almost all of those who led the campaign to bring him to account were black, like Thuli Madonsela, the former public protector, who played a heroic role in exposing Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption. South Africa\u2019s judiciary, which is majority black, defended the independence of the courts with extraordinary courage and under great pressure. After this display of black courage, why would it matter what white people think?\n\nBut South Africa is too fraught and complex a place for such a simple story to ring true. More plausible is that each pinprick penetrating Mr. Zuma\u2019s skin is felt by black South Africans, even those who are horrified by what he has done.\n\nBeneath the surface of public life, one can detect a strange, subliminal to-and-fro. Last year, for instance, a superb book describing in meticulous detail the deep corruption of the late apartheid years, \u201cApartheid Guns and Money,\u201d by Hennie van Vuuren, was a runaway best seller. It deserved to be widely read, but the scale of its success is partly a function of its utility as a weapon against white arrogance. \u201cHowever bad Zuma is,\u201d its many black readers could say to themselves, \u201cyou people were worse.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

For the truth is that Mr. Zuma and his allies were corrupt partly because they felt a sense of grievance intimately connected to their experience of race.\n\nWhen Mr. Zuma became president of South Africa in 2009, he rallied behind him an alliance of people who felt themselves to be marginal and neglected, not just in relation to the world economic order or white South Africa but also in relation to the A.N.C. itself. The A.N.C. has been run by people drawn from the ranks of an urbane, cosmopolitan elite.\n\nMr. Zuma represented a dramatic change in this tradition. Although he spent years in exile and climbed the ranks of the A.N.C., his biography was unlike any of his predecessors\u2019. Nelson Mandela was born into royalty. Thabo Mbeki was the son of prominent intellectuals. Mr. Zuma\u2019s mother worked in the kitchen of a white family and was too poor to provide her son with a formal education. He grew up herding cattle in the hinterland.\n\nWhen he came to power in 2009, he did so with the support of organizations representing much of the urban working class \u2014 the country\u2019s largest trade union and the South African Communist Party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut he soon dropped these organizations and turned for support to rural South Africa, in particular to traditional leaders and to the elites of far-flung provincial capitals. They carried with them into power an abiding sense of powerlessness, a feeling that the very institutions they now controlled were alien and belonged to others. In office, they believed that they had entered into their enemy\u2019s mansion. It seemed to be payback time.\n\nIn a speech delivered to a room of black businesspeople in December 2016, Mr. Zuma warned of the sophisticated ways in which the enemy confuses black people. One source of such confusion was the prevailing economic orthodoxy. Mr. Zuma suggested that the most fundamental of economic laws was merely nominal; remove the scales from our eyes and we see that so-called economic laws are a ruse invented by the powerful.\n\nHis genre of criminality is light-years from the sort that characterized the apartheid state. The corruption of apartheid\u2019s leaders stemmed from arrogance; they believed that they could control the world forever. Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption stems from the grievances of a man who feels very small.\n\nThis sense of grievance was on display in the last words he uttered publicly as president. In a swipe at his successor, Mr. Ramaphosa, Mr. Zuma suggested that those in the party who had unseated him were \u201cserving the interests of the oppressors of yesteryear, who joyfully celebrate as we lynch one another.\u201d\n\nBlack nationalism in South Africa has many faces. Mr. Ramaphosa represents a strand that is bourgeois, worldly and comfortable with power. There is also a militant, socialist strand of black nationalism, but it is on the wane. And there is the strand represented by Mr. Zuma, who governed as a man shaped and distorted by the violence and oppression of white supremacy.\n\nI am of course alive to the irony of a white South African like me saying that a black president\u2019s corruption was motivated by racial grievance. Many South Africans, black and white, would regard this argument as an excuse for the intolerable. But we should be honest enough to accept that even now, notwithstanding that apartheid has been gone since before nearly half the South African population was born, the legacy of white supremacy has lived on in the man who was president.", "keywords": ["white", "apartheid", "mess", "whats", "south", "corruption", "africa", "zuma", "mr", "economic", "zumas", "jacob", "distinctive", "black"], "polarity": 0.0616115067727971, "subjectivity": 0.37158776707163793},

Evenly lit, crisply photographed, they look like pictures from an illustrated medical dictionary, indexical images of heads, torsos and mouths that are detached from context. Even in a work like \u201cFigure\u201d (1991), the figure in question, sheathed in a black dress and set in the black infinity of no particular place, feels like a fragment, as though she had been extracted from a group photo or a furnished room. The texts accompanying her, eight engraved plastic plaques, read like excerpts from a language primer: \u201cfigured the worst,\u201d \u201che was disfigured,\u201d \u201cfigured there would be no reaction\u201d and so on. Here, not only has the story been winnowed down; it is in fact completely gone. There\u2019s no story. We are left with only the tensions of concrete poetry.\n\nSometime in the mid-1990s, Simpson began to detect clich\u00e9d responses to her work. At the same time, her own thinking was evolving. What does an image of a black woman mean? A commentary on race? An assertion about gender? Simpson branched out from figure-based images and began to experiment more with varied subject matter \u2014 landscapes and inanimate objects like wigs \u2014 and also with unusual quasi-sculptural material like felt and standing screens. A series of monumental multisectional images, several of them landscapes, collectively titled \u201cPublic Sex\u201d (1995-1998) and featuring no figures at all, addressed the provocative title only obliquely. These pictures, made over many years, contain what the scholar and curator Okwui Enwezor calls \u201cthe rumor of the body.\u201d Mysteries of a jagged and deadpan sort, they would go on to influence the noirish tone of Simpson\u2019s later film work.\n\nPhoto\n\nSimpson began to set ever more intricate conceptual layers between her initial inspiration for a work and the finished product. The idea for \u201c9 Props\u201d (1995) began during a residency at the Pilchuck Glass School in Washington. With the aid of artisans at the school, she fabricated a series of dark vessels modeled on vases and other objects used in the portrait work of the pioneering Harlem photographer James Van Der Zee. But these vessels were not the final work. She shipped them back to New York and then photographed them against a plain background. And that still was not the work. Further intervention followed: She turned those photographic images into nine lithographs, which she printed on felt. Finally, she wrote captions below each lithographed vessel, describing the context in which it originally appeared. One of them, for instance, reads:\n\nDinner Party with boxer Harry Wills, 1926 James VanDerZee Harry Wills a k a \u201cThe Black Panther,\u201d boxer, businessman- sits with seven other men and women, mostly women with champagne glasses raised as a woman on his left makes a toast in his honor. There are three bottles of champagne, a crystal decanter, a bottle of port, an arrangement of flowers and fruit, and before each guest an untouched china place setting.\n\nPhoto\n\nFrom multiple directions, the work gestures at what cannot be seen: the original placement of the vessels that inspired Simpson\u2019s own, the people in the photographs by James Van Der Zee, the social life of Harlem evoked by his photographs and the complexity of manners and class implied by them. All that vanished world of culture and experience is reduced to an elegant grid, as simple as an antiquarian\u2019s catalog, a thought picture that demands calm engagement and imaginative intervention on the viewer\u2019s part. Without being representational, it is about race; but race is not off in some category by itself, hemmed in only by questions of skin color, separate from life.\n\n\u201cRepresent!\u201d in the black American sense means standing up for your people, expressing solidarity and letting a shared ethos underwrite your presence and work. It is an exhortation, a greeting and a farewell. The word also has more conventional associations. In the visual arts, it is contrasted with the abstract or the symbolic. To represent, in this more common sense, is to make work that visually corresponds to realities out there in the world: to illustrate uncomplicatedly. This second sense of \u201crepresent\u201d is enjoying a vogue in the art world. Realism is back. This is welcome: after so long an absence of black figures and black faces in art museums, they are now being seen more frequently. Many artists, black and otherwise, are depicting the black body. It is necessary and often successful. Just as often, it fails when it is little more than a clumsy shorthand for socially concerned art, unobjectionable and unimpressive.\n\nA strong appeal of Simpson\u2019s work is that she has always embraced the inherent complexity of blackness, her own blackness as well as the blackness that runs ineluctably through American history. She does not reject representational depictions, but neither does she feel the need to confine herself only to \u201crace\u201d work. When an artist uses a black model, she is presenting a human question by foregrounding a human presence. Is a white man a person while a black woman is and can only be a gendered and racialized subject? As the scholar Kellie Jones has pointed out, nonwhite bodies are often thought of as \u201cnot neutral enough for the dispassionate formulas thought to constitute conceptual practice.\u201d If a black woman\u2019s race and gender are the only things apparent to certain viewers, Simpson seems to say, the ethical responsibility to escape those shackles is the viewer\u2019s.\n\nFreedom is Lorna Simpson\u2019s starting point and her permanent theme. A humane current animates all of her work, a current that neither sidesteps nor confines itself to race. Her work is simultaneously about the \u201cneutral\u201d space of ideas and the particularized experience of the body. \u201cMontage\u201d is photographic and painterly, a riff on a pair of found photographs, sequenced to look like a giant strip of film. It deals with dreams and nightmares, ambiguities and vulnerabilities. At its heart is what Simpson calls \u201cthe push and pull of photography\u201d: the stuttering potential inherent in mechanical reproduction and the imperfect registrations that mirror subconscious life.

To some extent, there\u2019s always been an adversarial role between the White House and reporters. How do you feel about the tenor of things now? It used to be friendly-adversarial. There would be retaliation for stories they didn\u2019t like, but nothing compared with this. There\u2019s a war going on. For a president to come out with the term \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 he\u2019s putting targets on our heads. He has moved the goal posts when it comes to how politicians and people deal with the press.\n\nWhat\u2019s the value of the White House press briefing? Transparency. There is a veil on the White House; people want to look behind the curtain. It\u2019s their house. When you open up a press briefing to see the back and forth, you\u2019re getting more in the weeds of what\u2019s going on, beyond just the quote we may put in the story. This is a key piece that I don\u2019t think people really get: When you talk about the press, it\u2019s not about journalists; it\u2019s about the free-flowing information that the American public is supposed to get. When you bash the press, you\u2019re bashing the idea of getting truth out.\n\nWhat\u2019s the public opinion of the White House press corps? It depends on whom you talk to. We\u2019re so tribal now. There used to be a day when you didn\u2019t know the person\u2019s politics. The line has been obscured between facts and opinion. I think it started during the Clinton years, and it just kept getting progressively worse. People don\u2019t want to just hear the news; they want to hear what people have to say about it too.\n\nYour reactions during the televised briefings have generated memes. Has it made you more self-conscious? I\u2019m so sad about that. My boss has always said, \u201cYou need to know how to play poker.\u201d I don\u2019t. I\u2019m trying! The last time I was really caught off guard was when Sarah Huckabee Sanders said something about people\u2019s minds being in the gutter after President Trump\u2019s tweet about Kirsten Gillibrand. I really get into those briefings. I really try to listen. I don\u2019t play to the camera. I go in there, and I\u2019m really earnest. So when she said that, I was shocked! I was like, No, God, that was a little bit much.\n\nGiven how much you tangle with this particular administration, why do you think you get called on so much? Have you felt like a target? Yes, I have. But I have to shake that off, because I have to go in and do my job. I cover the White House. I cover all issues, particularly those that affect black and brown Americans. Now, what if they didn\u2019t call on me? A certain segment of America would not get the answers to some of their pressing questions. If I don\u2019t ask, who will?\n\nRyan is the White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks and a political analyst for CNN. Age: 50 Occupation: Journalist Hometown: Baltimore Her Top 5 Movies to Unwind With: 1. \u201cCarmen Jones\u201d 2. \u201cSelma\u201d 3. \u201cHidden Figures\u201d 4. \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d 5. \u201cPurple Rain\u201d\n\nDo you find yourself surprised by the questions you ask? You had to ask whether this president believed slavery was wrong. I recently asked him, \u201cAre you a racist?\u201d It\u2019s a sad day when you have to ask a sitting president that. There has been a series of comments or lack of action, from calling Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas\u201d to how he dealt with Charlottesville to his comments on Norway versus Haiti, Africa, El Salvador, black and brown nations. It\u2019s not been one thing. It\u2019s been a pattern. So I asked. He did not answer, which I thought was a wasted moment. He could have put it to rest right then and there and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a racist.\u201d But it took him days to say that.\n\nYou said it seems as if it has changed, going forward, how the White House deals with the press corps and wields its power. What do you think this means for the next president you cover? He\u2019ll clamp down harder on us. Each president has pushed us further away from access. Who knows what will happen or what another president may want? They may not want to be followed. President Obama didn\u2019t like being followed, for example. This president hates us. He\u2019s warring on us. Once we lose ground on something, it\u2019s hard to get it back.", "keywords": ["white", "president", "didnt", "political", "im", "ask", "press", "house", "questions", "really", "ryan", "asks", "dont", "think"], "polarity": -0.020396090534979424, "subjectivity": 0.313969723691946}
