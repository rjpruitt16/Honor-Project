Cox (Getty Images)\n\nI probably watched less college basketball this year than I ever have. Actually, \u201cprobably\u201d is unnecessary. That is definitely true. For someone as obsessed with basketball as I am, this might seem odd. But I have a few perfectly rational reasons for this lack of viewership:\n\nThe second draft of my book is due soon, which means that some days I\u2019m working from 9:30 a.m.-ish to 5 p.m.-ish (on VSB stuff) and then from 9 p.m.-ish to 2 a.m.-ish (on book stuff).\n\nThe team that\u2019s usually my favorite to watch (the University of Pittsburgh) might have been the worst team in major Division I basketball this year.\n\nI\u2019m playing basketball three times a week now.\n\nMy nephew is the starting point guard for his high school team, and I\u2019ve been to several of his games.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve watched enough to have a general idea of who is good, and I know enough to know who the top NBA prospects are. So when I filled out my bracket this year, I went with Arizona\u2014the team that has the best NBA prospect (DeAndre Ayton) and three other players (Rawle Alkins, Dusan Ristic and maybe Allonzo Trier) who might be in the league.\n\nAnd then Arizona got blown the fuck out.\n\nUsually, when a lower seed beats a high seed that\u2019s thought to be a title contender, it\u2019s because the lower-seeded team shot the lights out. Or the higher-seeded team couldn\u2019t hit shit. Or maybe the game showed that the teams were actually a bit more equal than the seeds would suggest. But Buffalo beat Arizona like they were a No. 1 seed and Arizona was a 16. They didn\u2019t just beat them. They punked them. In the last five minutes of the game, Arizona just gave up. It was such a display that even though it ruined my bracket, I was rooting for Buffalo to run up the score.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now, the day after that\u2014and the day after Trae Young was knocked out, too\u2014I want everyone\u2019s brackets to be as fucked as mine is. I want UMBC to beat Virginia and Bucknell to spank Michigan State. I want Charleston to do the Charleston on y\u2019all\u2019s brackets\u2019 grills. I want to see Texas Southern and Trae Jefferson (my new favorite player in college basketball) in the championship game.\n\n(Also, if you have a minute, watch these clips of Jefferson in high school. You won\u2019t be disappointed.)\n\nBefore Arizona lost, I was normal and well-adjusted Damon. I was Damon with dreams and goals and a savings account. I was Damon who intentionally ate some kale yesterday because I knew I needed something green in my system. I was Damon who just really enjoyed a comfortable pair of socks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow I just want anarchy. I want all brackets busted.

So I'm saying it again (with some minor edits)***\n\nAs I type this, the remnants of a fried egg and bacon sandwich sits on a plate to my left. What was once a towering piece of sandwich art has been reduced to a dozen or so desolate crumbs and two lone strands of grated Parmesan cheese. If you squint, it looks like a map of Rhode Island.\n\nI live within a two mile radius of a supermarket and (at least) 20 different restaurants, and my refrigerator is (surprisingly) stocked. My food options are limitless. I chose to create and devour this sandwich because I had a very specific craving for the very specific combination of ingredients.\n\nI did not eat my fried egg and bacon sandwich and wish it were a Big Mac. Or a pizza. Or leftover roast beef. Or even a fried egg and sausage sandwich. I also did not attempt to make my fried egg and bacon sandwich taste more like a Big Mac, a pizza, leftover roast beef, or a fried egg and sausage sandwich. If I wanted any of those things, I would have eaten them.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t. So I didn\u2019t. And now I\u2019m full. And happy.\n\nThe 2014-2015 NBA season started yesterday. I am very happy about this. Basketball isn\u2019t just my favorite sport. It is my favorite non-essential thing on Earth, and I enjoy watching NBA basketball more than I enjoy consuming any other type of media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not unique in my interest in NBA basketball. I am, though, (somewhat) unique in my love for and acceptance of its current form. NBA basketball is my fried egg and bacon sandwich. I do not want it to be a Big Mac.\n\nI realize this food analogy is ridiculous. But to understand the NBA\u2019s strange place in our cultural zeitgeist, ridiculousness seems appropriate. Necessary, even. To wit, by every conceivable metric (TV ratings, star quality, estimated sale price of teams, quality of play, transcendent beards, etc), the National Basketball Association is thriving. Yet, a very large percentage of people interested in the league\u2019s success and/or demise remain convinced there are cavernous, fundamental wrongs at the base of it's foundation. Basically, the league is fucked up and needs to be fixed.\n\nThis in itself isn\u2019t ridiculous, or even unwelcome. If everyone felt the exact same way about the exact same things, we\u2019d all work at Trader Joe\u2019s. What is ridiculous is that its perceived wrongs are only wrongs because it\u2019s being compared to three completely separate and completely ridiculous entities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. An idealized version of an NBA past that never actually existed.\n\n2. A decidedly worse version of NBA basketball. (NCAA basketball)\n\n3. Walmart. (And, by \u201cWalmart\u201d I mean \u201cAmerica,\u201d and by \u201cAmerica\u201d I mean \u201cThe NFL\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, for those who believe the NBA has big problems, the NBA\u2019s biggest problems are 1. it\u2019s not something it never has been, 2. it\u2019s not a worse version of itself, and 3. it\u2019s not something it never will be.\n\nAnd this is why I love it.\n\nThorough explanations of why the idealized past never actually existed and why college basketball is inferior would venture into basketball wonk territory, and I\u2019ll spare you from that. Today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, lets focus on Walmart.\n\nThe NFL has parity. Well, at least the perception of parity. I\u2019m not even sure if Kansas City fielded a team in 2012. I think they used their football stadium for monster truck rallies and Civil War reenactments every Sunday. But they had one of the NFL's best teams in 2013. They did not win the Super Bowl. But, their fans legitimately believed they have a chance. This is great. For the NFL.\n\nThe NBA does not have the same type of parity. The season has just begun, but those who follow the sport already know there are maybe five teams with a realistic shot of winning the NBA championship this year. Naturally, any conversation that brings up the NBA\u2019s place in the sports universe will cite the NFL\u2019s any-given-Sunday-ness as the reason for its popularity, implying that the NBA would be wise to try to emulate them. And, this is wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe unique nature of basketball means that a dominant player will have more opportunity to provide an impact on the outcome of the game. (As good as Peyton Manning is, he doesn\u2019t play defense, so he\u2019s only able to have an effect on half of the game. Lebron, on the other hand, can conceivably play every minute.) This makes it inherently less random, and the length of the NBA\u2019s schedule and the playoffs series format make it even less random. These dynamics combine to make the NBA the sports world\u2019s truest meritocracy\u2014which I love\u2014and asking it to be more random and more like the NFL is asking a fried egg and bacon sandwich to be a Big Mac.\n\nThere\u2019s also the argument that there are too many games. And this also is an argument that compares the NBA season to the NFL season. And this is also a ridiculous argument.\n\nWhile the common point of the argument\u2014less games means that each game matters more\u2014seems to make sense, it also implies that people who love football love it because there\u2019s less of it. Which sub-implies that people who love football don\u2019t actually love football. If you love something specifically because there isn\u2019t much of it, you don\u2019t really love it that much. You love waiting for it, looking forward to it, and craving it, but you don\u2019t love it itself. And, because I love watching NBA basketball so much, it doesn\u2019t matter much to me that the season is long and every game doesn\u2019t have the mythical import that a 16 game season might have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI realize the title is (somewhat) misleading. It outright says that the post will explain my love for NBA basketball, but the bulk of the post is devoted to one of the reasons why people who don\u2019t love it don\u2019t love it. This would seem to be a very insecure expression of love.\n\nBut all explanations of love eventually sound insecure. Not because the person in love is trying to convince themselves, but because any attempt to articulate and deconstruct love is going to fall short.\n\nBasically, I love NBA basketball because it\u2019s NBA basketball and not anything else. Which doesn\u2019t say anything.

Heaphy, and, at 200 pages (pdf), in an extremely detailed analysis of all the events leading up to the Charlottesville protest.\n\nAs Heaphy states in the report, he and his team culled through hundreds of thousands of documents, hours of video and thousands of photographs. As the New York Times notes, while Heaphy assigns some blame to the University of Virginia and Charlottesville city leaders, he reserves the sharpest criticism for the Charlottesville and Virginia State police.\n\nAt the Unite the Right rally on Aug. 12\u2014the day counterprotester Heather Heyer was run over by a white supremacist\u2014Virginia State Police \u201cdirected its officers to remain behind barricades rather than risk injury responding to conflicts,\u201d Heaphy found. The same was true of Charlottesville police, who were instructed not to intervene \u201cin all but the most serious physical confrontations.\u201d\n\nAnd the police followed this command to the letter. Heaphy noted that when the violence was at its worst, Charlottesville police \u201cpulled officers back to a protected area of the park.\u201d The cops remained there for over an hour, letting the fighting descend into chaos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd at the intersection where Heyer was mowed down? Only one officer was posted there. But she\u2014accustomed to working school patrol\u2014feared for her safety and called for assistance.

No replacement was sent.\n\nHeaphy also notes that Charlottesville Police Chief Al Thomas tried to obstruct the investigation: commanding staff to delete text messages that were relevant to the outside review.\n\n\u201cChief Thomas also used a personal email account to conduct some CPD business, then falsely denied using personal email in response to a specific FOIA [Freedome of Information Act] request,\u201d Heaphy noted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen confronted about this, Thomas, Charlottesville\u2019s first black police chief, denied that the department had tried to hide information from the investigators.\n\nThe exhaustive report concluded that law enforcement \u201cfailed to maintain order and protect citizens from harm, injury, and death.\u201d\n\nUnite the Right organizer Jason Kessler is currently lobbying the city of Charlottesville to let him hold a second rally in August 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the New York Times or read the full report here (pdf).", "keywords": ["charlottesville", "calls", "york", "thomas", "va", "virginia", "protests", "heaphy", "report", "response", "state", "tried", "white", "weak", "obstruction", "times", "alleges"], "polarity": 0.01996216996216996, "subjectivity": 0.4275837525837528},

We recognize that we have created this confusion and need to resolve it. We have paused all general verifications while we work and will report back soon.\u201d\n\nFirst of all, Anil Dash already said that Wednesday night. It looks as if all Twitter did was take Dash\u2019s tweet, reword it and send it out to make it look as if the platform has had some deep and profound epiphany. It hasn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cAlso verification is still deliberately being used to conflate \u2018this person is who they say they are\u2019 with \u2018this person has higher status,\u2019\u201d Dash wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that is the key. Twitter has used the verification system as described purposely. There\u2019s a reason people\u2014folks with legitimate reasons to be verified\u2014have to go through hell and high water to get that blue check mark. Twitter has wielded verification like a weapon and held it over people\u2019s heads as something they should aspire to or go to great lengths to achieve. This has been purposeful and intentional, and everyone knows it.\n\nSo when Twitter then tries to come back and act as if it is just realizing this is a problem, it is disingenuous at best, and a purposeful deflection from the real issue at worst.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fact remains that, verified or not, Jason Kessler should not have an account at all, considering the Confederate-flag (hate symbol) imagery in his header, but I\u2019ll come back to that.\n\nJack Dorsey added on to the Twitter Support tweet and said, \u201cWe should\u2019ve communicated faster on this (yesterday): our agents have been following our verification policy correctly, but we realized some time ago the system is broken and needs to be reconsidered. And we failed by not doing anything about it. Working now to fix faster.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, Jack.\n\nYes, the verification system is \u201cbroken.\u201d And yes, it needs to be fixed, but there is a greater issue here.\n\nYou promised us weeks ago that the platform was going to take a more aggressive stance against hate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not just about Jason Kessler being verified. This is about Jason Kessler having an account that is clearly violating the rules that you claimed were going to be enforced more strictly, and about that account going through a verification process that actually puts human eyes at your company on his account\u2014and those human eyes saying, \u201cYes, let\u2019s elevate his platform with this blue checkmark.\u201d\n\nYour company admittedly created this verification pecking order, and your company has done everything to keep it in place.\n\nIt does not go unnoticed that your responses Thursday come after many, many people retweeted my post and my tweet thread and added you to the thread to draw your attention to it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou were able to easily ignore the pieces written by other outlets, but you could not ignore mine because it got a lot of traction on social media, and your hand was forced.\n\nSo you come out with this fake-ass \u201cmea culpa,\u201d and we are all supposed to applaud your supposed epiphany, but here\u2019s the thing: You guys say this about everything you get called out on. You said it on Oct. 13 when you got called out on the harassment-and-abuse issue. Your promised big changes.\n\nNothing has changed. It\u2019s business as usual on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou guys pussyfoot around every single issue that is brought to your attention, pretend to be contrite, then ultimately do nothing. This is the Twitter way.\n\nThe other day, I called your attention to someone who was harassing me on Twitter. I blocked the original account from which the person tweeted to me, and the person used a second account to continue the harassment. This is something I brought up in the post I wrote about the harassment problem.\n\nI openly asked for your help, and you ignored that call to duty.\n\nYou couldn\u2019t ignore this one, though.\n\nAnd you won\u2019t be able to ignore any further callouts because this is real.\n\nYou have created a monster, and it is time for you to either tame the beast or slay it altogether.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour move, my guy.\n\nEarlier:\n\nI\u2019ve decided it\u2019s going to be my personal and public crusade to air out Twitter every time it does something that runs counter to what it claims to be about. The platform\u2019s made a big deal recently about how much stricter it\u2019s going to be about enforcing its rules of terms of service, and we\u2019ve all seen Twitter do everything but that. This latest example is no exception.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the \u201cnew\u201d rules Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey outlined in his Oct. 13 tweet thread was a more aggressive stance against \u201chate symbols\u201d and \u201cviolent groups.\u201d How is it, then, that Twitter verified the account of the white nationalist who organized the rally in Charlottesville, Va.\u2014especially when said white nationalist has as his header photo the No. 1 image associated with white racism and hate: the Confederate flag?\n\nJason Kessler tweets under the handle @TheMadDimension. His bio says he is a freelance writer who has written for GotNews, Daily Caller and VDARE. He also identifies himself as the organizer of the Unite the Right rally, aka the Charlottesville riot that ended with the death of Heather Heyer, a counterprotester who was killed when one of Kessler\u2019s many followers plowed a vehicle into a crowd of people who had beliefs that differed from his own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKessler bragged on Twitter on Tuesday that his account had \u201cfinally\u201d been verified, which indicates that he applied for the privilege, and someone at Twitter reviewed his account and his credentials and determined that, yes, he should be given the credibility of a blue check mark by his name.\n\n\u201cLooks like I FINALLY got verified by Twitter,\u201d Kessler wrote. \u201cI must be the only working class white advocate with that distinction.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center lists Kessler as an \u201cextremist\u201d with a white nationalist ideology; he is included on the SPLC Hatewatch website.\n\nAccording to SPLC, Kessler attempted to unseat Charlottesville\u2019s only black city councilman\u2014Vice Mayor Wes Bellamy\u2014and served as a bridge between a Virginia gubernatorial candidate and the \u201calt-right.\u201d He is described as \u201crelying on the familiar tropes of \u2018white genocide\u2019 and \u2018demographic displacement.\u2019\u201d\n\nHere is an especially interesting tidbit from SPLC\u2019s dossier on Kessler:\n\nRumors abound on white nationalist forums that Kessler\u2019s ideological pedigree before 2016 was less than pure and seem to point to involvement in the Occupy movement and past support for President Obama. At one recent speech in favor of Charlottesville\u2019s status as a sanctuary city, Kessler live-streamed himself as an attendee questioned him and apologized for an undisclosed spat during Kessler\u2019s apparent involvement with Occupy. Kessler appeared visibly perturbed by the woman\u2019s presence and reminders of their past association.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKessler claims that he was radicalized after public relations exec Justine Sacco was fired for making an extremely tasteless and racist joke about AIDS in Africa in late 2013. (Sidenote: Remember the #HasJustineLandedYet hashtag? Good. Fucking. Times. That was really the golden age of Twitter, I swear.)\n\nKessler said of the Sacco incident, \u201c ... so it was a little racist joke, nothing that big of a deal, she didn\u2019t have that many followers, she probably didn\u2019t think anybody was going to see it.\u201d\n\nIn December 2016, Kessler wrote a post titled, \u201cThe End of Identity Politics: To Ensure Peace, Prepare for War,\u201d in which he said:\n\nBut make no mistake, the age of innocence is over for whites politically. We are becoming a displaced minority in our own country thanks to Democrat policies. They tax the hell out of middle class families who might want to have more children while paying for welfare queens to have 5 or 6 babies they can\u2019t support. They provide sanctuary cities for illegal immigrants who flood in from south of the border and import Islamists from the most dangerous countries on Earth. The time for supplication is over. We need to fight back!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter just validated everything this man has to say by giving him that blue check mark after his name.\n\nBut Twitter is taking a more aggressive stance against hate and violence, right?\n\nRight.\n\nTwitter is directly enabling white supremacy and white nationalist ideology.\n\nTwitter is full of shit.", "keywords": ["account", "verify", "oops", "itsoon", "accidentally", "verified", "going", "broken", "support", "person", "twitter", "white", "fix", "kessler", "verification", "system", "nationalist"], "polarity": 0.04275498891352549, "subjectivity": 0.41693203815155033},

Stephen Upman, a Charlottesville police spokesman, said that the disorderly conduct charge is related to the makeshift flamethrower Long was seen using in the photo, and the assault and battery charge is related to a separate skirmish during the rally.\n\nLong is the second black counterprotester to be arrested in connection with the Charlottesville melee. The Los Angeles Times reports that Charlottesville police investigators arrested Long, 23, of Culpeper, Va., on Friday. A second man, DeAndre Harris, who had his head beaten in by white supremacists, was arrested a day before on charges of \u201cunlawful wounding,\u201d as previously reported by The Root.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The Root shortly after the rally, Long said that he acted in self-defense and was protecting an old man sitting next to him, who was being attacked by scores of white supremacists. As The Root reported:\n\n\u201cAt first it was peaceful protest,\u201d Long said softly as he spoke. \u201cUntil someone pointed a gun at my head. Then the same person pointed it at my foot and shot the ground.\u201d Long said the only weapon he had was a can of spray paint that a white supremacist had thrown at him earlier, so he took a lighter to the spray paint and turned it into a flamethrower. And a photographer snapped the photo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe police, he said, did nothing.\n\nThere is also another photograph of that moment that clearly shows a white supremacist marcher holding a gun and pointing it in Long\u2019s direction. That man, Richard Wilson Preston, 52, was arrested in August and charged with discharging a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school, according to the Times, but only after a video provided by the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia was given to the FBI. Preston faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLong was released on an unsecured bond Friday and referred all questions to his attorney, Malik Zulu Shabazz, national president of the Black Lawyers for Justice and former national chairman of the New Black Panther Party.\n\nThe Times reports that in August, two of Harris\u2019 alleged attackers\u2014Alex Michael Ramos, 33, and Daniel Borden, 18\u2014were arrested after they were identified by activists through video and social media, and earlier this week, a third man, Jacob Goodwin, 22, was also arrested in Harris\u2019 attack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, for those keeping score, two black counterprotesters\u2014who clearly, in the eyes of most sane people, were acting in self-defense\u2014have been arrested in Virginia, and four white supremacists have been, too.\n\nThe fifth white supremacist arrested, of course, was James Alex Fields Jr., who is charged with driving a car through a crowd of counterprotesters and killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring at least 19 others.\n\nGuess Virginia police are taking the Trumpian stance of blaming \u201cboth sides.\u201d\n\nRead more at the Los Angeles Times.", "keywords": ["charlottesville", "supremacist", "supremacists", "long", "protect", "virginia", "wielding", "flamethrower", "arrested", "black", "white", "va", "times", "man", "corey"], "polarity": 0.023915626856803325, "subjectivity": 0.3005793226381462},

Physical evidence showed that McKnight was not as close as Gasser claimed he was when the shooting occurred, but will that make a difference to the jury?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Aviva Shen points out for In Justice Today, Jefferson Parish\u2014Louisiana\u2019s largest county and also where the trial is taking place\u2014faced accusations of racism immediately following the Dec. 1, 2016, shooting.

Why should I waste time in the white community?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJefferson Parish is a county where blacks make up more than 25 percent of the population, but only one black woman is on the Gasser jury.\n\nFrom In Justice Today:\n\nJefferson Parish has a habit of keeping black residents off juries. A 2003 report by the Louisiana Crisis Assistance Center, a capital defense nonprofit, found that Jefferson Parish prosecutors removed black prospective jurors in felony trials at more than three times the rate they removed white ones. Though racial discrimination in juries is unconstitutional, the Louisiana Supreme Court has studiously ignored most challenges. The high rate of exclusion means that 80 percent of criminal trials in Jefferson Parish have no black representation on the jury, according to the civil rights nonprofit Equal Justice Initiative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe know that this is by design. Louisiana as a whole has one of the worst track records when it comes to its criminal-justice system. It is one of just two states in the country that allow nonunanimous jury verdicts\u2014a system that was put in place to nullify black influence on juries.\n\nAs In Justice Today notes, white men who kill black men in the U.S. are eight times more likely to have that killing ruled as justified.\n\nSo, with just one black woman on a jury full of white people\u2014what does that mean when it comes to justice for Joe McKnight?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe will be lucky if we see any justice.\n\nRead more at In Justice Today.", "keywords": ["parish", "woman", "help", "gasser", "nfl", "white", "mcknight", "jefferson", "black", "juror", "justice", "player", "jury", "joe", "shooting"], "polarity": 0.02195379723157501, "subjectivity": 0.36600315322537547},

The white man accused of shooting him, Ronald Gasser, was charged with second-degree murder. Gasser\u2019s fate will be decided by a jury with just one black woman on it. Will there be justice for McKnight?\n\nGasser, 56, is accused of gunning down 28-year-old McKnight after a \u201cmutual road rage\u201d car chase during which they allegedly gave each other the finger and called each other names. Gasser\u2019s trial for second-degree murder began Friday. He pleaded not guilty and claimed that the shooting was in self-defense.\n\nOn Monday the jury watched a videotaped interview that took place between detectives and Gasser just one day after he fatally shot McKnight. Gasser told detectives that he was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of his vehicle, and McKnight was on the passenger side with his hands and upper torso \u201cprimarily in the vehicle.\u201d\n\nIn a prior interview, Gasser had said that he shot McKnight after McKnight made an aggressive lunge toward him. Physical evidence showed that McKnight was not as close as Gasser claimed he was when the shooting occurred, but will that make a difference to the jury?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Aviva Shen points out for In Justice Today, Jefferson Parish\u2014Louisiana\u2019s largest county and also where the trial is taking place\u2014faced accusations of racism immediately following the Dec. 1, 2016, shooting. Although Gasser confessed to shooting McKnight three times in broad daylight, he was initially released without any charges by the Jefferson Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nThen-Sheriff Newell Normand claimed in a Dec. 6, 2016, news conference that race wasn\u2019t a factor in the case, then proceeded to read from messages full of expletives and racial slurs that he said had been directed at him and other officials as a result of their handling of the case.\n\nThis is the same Jefferson Parish where former Sheriff Harry Lee said in 2006: \u201cWe know the crime is in the black community. Why should I waste time in the white community?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJefferson Parish is a county where blacks make up more than 25 percent of the population, but only one black woman is on the Gasser jury.\n\nFrom In Justice Today:\n\nJefferson Parish has a habit of keeping black residents off juries. A 2003 report by the Louisiana Crisis Assistance Center, a capital defense nonprofit, found that Jefferson Parish prosecutors removed black prospective jurors in felony trials at more than three times the rate they removed white ones. Though racial discrimination in juries is unconstitutional, the Louisiana Supreme Court has studiously ignored most challenges. The high rate of exclusion means that 80 percent of criminal trials in Jefferson Parish have no black representation on the jury, according to the civil rights nonprofit Equal Justice Initiative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe know that this is by design. Louisiana as a whole has one of the worst track records when it comes to its criminal-justice system. It is one of just two states in the country that allow nonunanimous jury verdicts\u2014a system that was put in place to nullify black influence on juries.\n\nAs In Justice Today notes, white men who kill black men in the U.S. are eight times more likely to have that killing ruled as justified.\n\nSo, with just one black woman on a jury full of white people\u2014what does that mean when it comes to justice for Joe McKnight?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe will be lucky if we see any justice.\n\nRead more at In Justice Today.", "keywords": ["parish", "woman", "help", "gasser", "nfl", "white", "mcknight", "jefferson", "black", "juror", "justice", "player", "jury", "joe", "shooting"], "polarity": 0.02195379723157501, "subjectivity": 0.36600315322537547},

I'm going to need them to stop acting like teenagers whose feelings get hurt on Twitter. I'm going to need them to log off and do their jobs.\n\nTo date, the president-elect and the Jefferson Parish Sheriff investigating a murder on a national stage can't stop talking or tweeting about their feelings. Donald Trump's history of being thin-skinned is well documented, but on Tuesday, Sheriff Newell Normand continued his string of odd behavior since the shooting death of former running NFL back Joe McKnight.\n\nAccording to reports, McKnight and Ronald Gasser, 54 were engaged in some sort of road rage incident that left McKnight dead at the end of Gasser's gun. Gasser waited for police to arrive on the scene, handed over his weapon and was handcuffed and arrested. Where things took a really strange turn was at some point that night, Normand released Gasser and then held a press conference in which he defended not only his decision to release him, but the shooter.\n\n\"Mr. Gasser isn't going anywhere,\" Normand said.\n\nIn learning that Gasser may have become a target of violence, a police cruiser was reportedly ordered to sit outside of Gasser's home. That's right, the police were protecting the killer while he sat in his own home less than 24 hours after the killing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, news stations learned that Gasser had been arrested and charged with manslaughter, not because the police released the information, but because reporters found that Gasser had been booked into the jail's public system. Later Tuesday, Normand held another bizarre press conference in which he read emails that people have sent to public officials since Gasser's release.\n\n\"You punk ass Uncle Tom coon, we saw you sell out to them you rat ass faggot punk,\" Gasser read. \"You ass kissing fa\u2014ot that has done little to our community. All we know is that you are a b\u2014ch puppet, you rat a\u2014 looking coon on TV; I bet they made you say that puppet boy, I know what I see, I know that Normand is a piece of sh-t and you stood behind that white boy with that bulls\u2014t, nig\u2014. You won't even stand with your people you self serving son of a b\u2014ch.\"\n\nLet me bring you back up to speed: road rage, 54-year-old white man shoots and kills ex-NFL running back. All the public wants is justice that looks like justice in the form of justice. That if the man who shot and killed someone is arrested, that he be put in jail, have a bail set and then a trial. What the people who want justice have gotten is the release of said killer and two lectures from the man who's supposed to be a catalyst for justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs far as the email, I call bulls\u2014t. I know the language was supposed to imply that the letter was written by a black person, in fact when the sheriff was asked why he felt it important to read the letter he devolved into another lecture about black on black crime, but I don't think any black person wrote that. I'm not saying it wasn't sent to an official, but I am saying that I don't think a black person sent it. The flow is off. We don't triple down on our slurs that way. There is a rhythm to our language and this sounds choppy and forced. I'm not saying that the sheriff wrote the note himself and then walked out there to make himself and his colleagues the victim of a murder investigation. I'm saying that it was mad bizarre for the sheriff to read that letter at that time if he wasn't trying to make himself the center of a murder investigation.\n\nTwice now, the public has been chastised for wanting a killer to be brought to justice by the sheriff handling the investigation. Twice now, this oddball, who keeps acting as if hurtful words are stopping him from doing his job, has lectured the public.\n\nThis is the Trumpian effect. Leaders no longer have to be above the fray, they are in the fray. And there appears to be a certain joy that a group of Trump voters feel in being openly racist. If the president can hate freely on Twitter then why can't a small backwoods sheriff turn a murder investigation press conference into a national dressing down. Maybe I missed the part where the sheriff has called for justice for McKnight. Maybe I missed the part where the sheriff has talked about making everyone in the community feel safe. So far we have two times where the sheriff has gotten into his feelings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt this point, I can only give this dumba\u2014 sherrif and the dumba\u2014 president-elect a word of advice, we don't need your lectures or your leadership, but we do need you to do your job.\n\nAnd if being on Twitter or email is too difficult for your little fragile feelings then log the f\u2014k off.", "keywords": ["nigga", "la", "real", "gasser", "need", "sheriff", "saying", "read", "happy", "normand", "black", "justice", "im", "say", "public"], "polarity": -0.02292843691148776, "subjectivity": 0.3483319881624966},

Was George Washington a slave owner? So, will George Washington now lose his status? Are we going to take ... down statues to George Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson?

This All Lives Matter revolution in response to his presidency\u2014and the hoodless Klanspeople and White Citizens\u2019 Councillors it has emboldened\u2014is born of the realization that more white people will die. More white people will be collateral damage in a war on poor and working-class black and brown people that has decimated communities and families for generations.

This America has been nurtured, massaged and shaped brick by brick by a whiteness that is rotten to its core. To paraphrase James Baldwin from his 1970 letter to Angela Davis, black people in this country have long warned so-called good white folks that if they stood down while the badge-wearing lynchers, the U.S.-military-uniform-wearing fascists, the black-robe-wearing white supremacists and the domestic terrorists next door came for us in the morning, then they would surely come for them at night.\n\n\n\nThis I know to be true: There would be no widespread calls to \u201cresist,\u201d no insistence that this is \u201cour revolution,\u201d no catchy chants of \u201cHey, hey, ho-ho, white supremacy has got to go\u201d if that had not come to pass.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen so-called good white people slow-dance with devils\u2014when the vile rhythm of racism, its crescendo and crash, is the embedded soundtrack of this wretched nation\u2014they should not be surprised when they wake up in hell.\n\nThe state-sanctioned executions of little black boys and girls have been marginalized, considered too \u201cpoliticized\u201d a cause to pledge allegiance to openly and without reservation, but this political fight that has led to the spilling of white blood is supposed to be an American one by default.\n\n\n\nNo. I will not pretend that this is a new America for some false sense of unity. I will not pretend that this is \u201cTrump\u2019s America.\u201d I will not pretend that the time for open rebellion and revolution has just now dawned for the sake of white comfort.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI will not dance.\n\n\n\nThere is one quote from Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s \u201cLetter From Birmingham Jail\u201d (pdf) that speaks to the myth of time and calls out white liberals for their complicity:\n\n\n\nI have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro\u2019s great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizens Councillor or the Ku Klux Klanner but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says, \u201cI agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can\u2019t agree with your methods of direct action\u201d; who paternalistically feels that he can set the timetable for another man\u2019s freedom; who lives by the myth of time; and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a \u201cmore convenient season.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe know this quote as a call to reflection and an acceptance of accountability, but there is another quote in that same letter that is an unapologetically urgent call to action:\n\n\n\nThough I was initially disappointed at being categorized as an extremist, as I continued to think about the matter I gradually gained a measure of satisfaction from the label.

They were the kind of couple that threw amazing dinner and cocktail parties, who were the picture of love and affection everywhere they went, and generally made you feel good whenever you were around them. No one knows how long the breakup was pending, but when the news spread through our circle of friends, we were all collectively shook.\n\n\n\nWhen we finally recovered from the news of their breakup, a new panic spread among us: Who would get the friends after the breakup?\n\nThis may seem like a petty question to ask, but in some situations it is a real consideration after a breakup. People are often expected to choose sides in the split, and that can be an impossible dilemma when you are close to both people in the now dissolved relationship.\n\nIn my case, I have known both people for a very long time, and I am close to both of them. The shock of the breakup aside (neither of them told me shit, and I\u2019m glad they didn\u2019t), I honestly don\u2019t want to have to choose one over the other because I love them both. I value both of them as friends. I want to be able to continue being friends with both of them.\n\nUnlike other breakups that involve cheating or a betrayal of some kind, theirs simply stems from their not wanting to be a couple any longer. As it was explained when the bombshell was dropped on me, they \u201cjust aren\u2019t compatible anymore.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey don\u2019t have children (thankfully), so there is only their shared apartment to split up (he\u2019s moving; she\u2019s staying). They will divide up their shared belongings and disconnect their lives rather seamlessly.\n\nSo, again, who gets the friends?\n\nWhat is the proper etiquette for these situations?\n\nThey haven\u2019t said that we as friends have to choose, but you know those awkward moments are going to present themselves when we are having a group outing or a group dinner or a party or get-together somewhere and we have to decide: Do we invite him or her?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou don\u2019t want to make anyone uncomfortable. Undoubtedly they will eventually move on and start dating other people. No one wants to end up with a scene like the one that happened when Issa ran into Lawrence and Aparna at Derek\u2019s birthday party on Insecure. It\u2019s too messy, and no one wants to be messy.\n\nSo who decides? Do the friends make the choice themselves? Does the couple decide who gets to still hang with whom?\n\nHow do you navigate these relationships post-breakup?\n\nI will admit that the petty overtook me during my last breakup, and I specifically told my ex that he was not allowed to have contact with any of the people he knew only because of me. I told them that, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTruth be told, it probably would have ended up working out that way anyway, because he\u2019s not exactly a social butterfly, and the idea of him reaching out to any of my friends to hang out was pretty preposterous in the grand scheme of things, but like I said\u2014I was petty, and I didn\u2019t even want him talking to them on social media. He didn\u2019t do that, either.\n\nIn that instance, it was my choice and he unwittingly obliged, but this is a couple known for being very social\u2014and the angst that it is creating in our friend circle got me wondering how we would figure all this out.\n\nWhat do you do when you break up with someone and you are friends with the same people? Do you make your friends choose? Do you choose?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHave you ever been in this situation before?\n\nThis is a point to ponder and discuss, so let me hear your thoughts in the comments.\n\nWe will be discussing \u201cWho gets the friends in the breakup?\u201d on our next The Root After Dark Twitter chat, Tuesday at 11 p.m. ET/8 p.m. PT. I will take over The Root\u2019s official Twitter account as always, and we will chop it up.

I'm going to need them to stop acting like teenagers whose feelings get hurt on Twitter. I'm going to need them to log off and do their jobs.\n\nTo date, the president-elect and the Jefferson Parish Sheriff investigating a murder on a national stage can't stop talking or tweeting about their feelings. Donald Trump's history of being thin-skinned is well documented, but on Tuesday, Sheriff Newell Normand continued his string of odd behavior since the shooting death of former running NFL back Joe McKnight.\n\nAccording to reports, McKnight and Ronald Gasser, 54 were engaged in some sort of road rage incident that left McKnight dead at the end of Gasser's gun. Gasser waited for police to arrive on the scene, handed over his weapon and was handcuffed and arrested. Where things took a really strange turn was at some point that night, Normand released Gasser and then held a press conference in which he defended not only his decision to release him, but the shooter.\n\n\"Mr. Gasser isn't going anywhere,\" Normand said.\n\nIn learning that Gasser may have become a target of violence, a police cruiser was reportedly ordered to sit outside of Gasser's home. That's right, the police were protecting the killer while he sat in his own home less than 24 hours after the killing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, news stations learned that Gasser had been arrested and charged with manslaughter, not because the police released the information, but because reporters found that Gasser had been booked into the jail's public system. Later Tuesday, Normand held another bizarre press conference in which he read emails that people have sent to public officials since Gasser's release.\n\n\"You punk ass Uncle Tom coon, we saw you sell out to them you rat ass faggot punk,\" Gasser read. \"You ass kissing fa\u2014ot that has done little to our community. All we know is that you are a b\u2014ch puppet, you rat a\u2014 looking coon on TV; I bet they made you say that puppet boy, I know what I see, I know that Normand is a piece of sh-t and you stood behind that white boy with that bulls\u2014t, nig\u2014. You won't even stand with your people you self serving son of a b\u2014ch.\"\n\nLet me bring you back up to speed: road rage, 54-year-old white man shoots and kills ex-NFL running back. All the public wants is justice that looks like justice in the form of justice. That if the man who shot and killed someone is arrested, that he be put in jail, have a bail set and then a trial. What the people who want justice have gotten is the release of said killer and two lectures from the man who's supposed to be a catalyst for justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs far as the email, I call bulls\u2014t. I know the language was supposed to imply that the letter was written by a black person, in fact when the sheriff was asked why he felt it important to read the letter he devolved into another lecture about black on black crime, but I don't think any black person wrote that. I'm not saying it wasn't sent to an official, but I am saying that I don't think a black person sent it. The flow is off. We don't triple down on our slurs that way. There is a rhythm to our language and this sounds choppy and forced. I'm not saying that the sheriff wrote the note himself and then walked out there to make himself and his colleagues the victim of a murder investigation. I'm saying that it was mad bizarre for the sheriff to read that letter at that time if he wasn't trying to make himself the center of a murder investigation.\n\nTwice now, the public has been chastised for wanting a killer to be brought to justice by the sheriff handling the investigation. Twice now, this oddball, who keeps acting as if hurtful words are stopping him from doing his job, has lectured the public.\n\nThis is the Trumpian effect. Leaders no longer have to be above the fray, they are in the fray. And there appears to be a certain joy that a group of Trump voters feel in being openly racist. If the president can hate freely on Twitter then why can't a small backwoods sheriff turn a murder investigation press conference into a national dressing down. Maybe I missed the part where the sheriff has called for justice for McKnight. Maybe I missed the part where the sheriff has talked about making everyone in the community feel safe. So far we have two times where the sheriff has gotten into his feelings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt this point, I can only give this dumba\u2014 sherrif and the dumba\u2014 president-elect a word of advice, we don't need your lectures or your leadership, but we do need you to do your job.\n\nAnd if being on Twitter or email is too difficult for your little fragile feelings then log the f\u2014k off.", "keywords": ["nigga", "la", "real", "gasser", "need", "sheriff", "saying", "read", "happy", "normand", "black", "justice", "im", "say", "public"], "polarity": -0.02292843691148776, "subjectivity": 0.3483319881624966},

I doubt she gave much of a damn about the grade of barbecue sauce purchased with the tray of boneless chicken wings or the fancy new Pack 'n Play her grandmother bought her. And I know she gave no fucks about the party's superhero motif, because the first thing she did when seeing the bedazzled Batman shirt I wore was attempt to eat the bat.\n\nI'm not much of a party person myself, but I looked forward to this day just to be able to witness her experiencing it. Her face when opening and playing with her gifts. (Which, as usual for her, landed somewhere between slightly bemused and slightly annoyed. My daughter is British, apparently.) Her eyes when she heard the \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d song sung to her for the first time. Her tiny legs as she walked from the cake stand to the couch her cousin was sitting on. And those same tiny legs an hour later when she apparently forgot she actually knows how to walk now and just started crawling everywhere.\n\nShe is my Feminist Octopus \u2014 a name I\u2019ve given her because her favorite words currently are \u201cstop\u201d and \u201cno.\u201d And also because she\u2019s so damn curious and engaged with her surroundings that it\u2019s like she had eight limbs; all simultaneously grabbing and touching and pulling and pinching. I know it\u2019s not the most creative nickname, but I\u2019m her dad and I\u2019m allowed to be corny.\n\nOur house right now is an emporium of random baby shit shoehorned into an adult living space. It's like someone went to Babies R Us, emptied 20 shelves into 50 different bags, drove to IKEA, and arbitrarily sprinkled the bags' content throughout the store; a GRACO easy fold highchair parked adjacent to the living room mantle and both the fireplace underneath it and the 65 inch Sony 4K Ultra HD TV on top of it; Chicka Chicka Boom Boom laying on a SV\u00c4RTAN limited edition collection tray table. When babies arrive to couples who've never had children before, their presence is a colonization. A welcome colonization of course. A colonization with footies and frequent viewings of Sesame Street on YouTube (in Spanish though because we want her to learn that too). But a colonization nonetheless. Your resources are devoted to them, your thoughts possessed with them, your instincts stirred by them.\n\nAnd its with this context that killings such as the killing of Joe McKnight are so fucking brutal. So fucking complete. Not necessarily to me. I, like many others who heard of the circumstances surrounding his death, felt an appropriate amount of outrage, sadness, and perplexity. But I wasn't devastated by it the same way the grandmother who rented the space for his first birthday party 27 years ago, the uncle who first taught him out to catch a football, and the mom and the dad who had their lives upended and colonized by him 28 years are most definitely today. I can't conjure many fates more cruel than to have a life that was treasured, prayed over, sacrificed for, led, and loved snatched away so senselessly. And for everyone \u2014 including the police \u2014 to know exactly who did it. And for that person to be free. As if those decades of memories and moments and gallons of formula and refilled diaper genies and doctors' office visits and Polaroids of first steps meant nothing. Like none of that mattered. Like it didn't even happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIts no secret that the undervaluing of Black lives isn't as much about a conscious and seething racial animus but more the inability to regard us as fully human; a dynamic that manifests as a reluctance to give our capacity to hurt, bleed, double over in pain, and die any benefit of the doubt. Its not that our lives and the diversity of life within each of our lives don't matter at all. They just don't matter as much. And for Black men and Black women as strong and sturdy and brown as Joe McKnight was, this modicum of empathy becomes nonexistent. He's been \"grown\" his entire life; a \"man\" since before he could ride a bike; a threat since before he could spell. Perhaps Ronald Gasser will eventually be arrested, charged, and convicted of his murder. But his freedom today \u2014 that he's receiving a consideration, a benefit of the doubt, that Joe McKnight did not, could not, and would never have \u2014 synopsizes America's feelings about men and women like the one he killed and the broken and brutalized families they leave behind; communicating to them and to us that those birthday parties didn't matter.

People make fun of that saying, but if you think about it, it is a mood, a message and a lifestyle. Each year on Dec. 31, we shed at least some part of our old selves and take on new habits, ideas or mantras. For me, Dec. 31, 2017, was no exception.\n\n\n\nAs I sought to adopt a few new habits for 2018, I looked to 2017 to see what things I could leave behind, especially as it pertains to my love life. At the top of my list were the following five things that I will now share with you:\n\n1. Playing on My Phone\n\nI actually really did have a dude saved in my contacts as \u201cPlaying on my phone.\u201d I stopped answering his calls, and on Dec. 31 I actually deleted him from my contacts. He earned that name because he was constantly doing two things that irk me. He would either text me constantly asking, \u201cWhen can I see you?\u201d or send a text asking if he could come over, and when I said yes, he would say he was on his way, and then I wouldn\u2019t hear from him. This happened once every three encounters, and after a while, I just got sick of that shit.\n\nIt\u2019s totally my fault for letting him get away with it for as long as I did, but in my defense \u2026\n\nAnyway, in 2018, that shit is dead and canceled. No more playing on my phone for anyone\u2014no matter how good the zick is. Go play with somebody else.\n\n2. \u201cPotential\u201d\n\nI\u2019m done fucking with potential. Let me qualify that by saying there is nothing wrong with being a work in progress. We all are, if you think about it. Sometimes, though, the work that needs to be done is too detailed and too time-consuming, and it needs to be done on their time and not yours. There is also the problem of men wanting you to help them do the work on their potential, like it\u2019s a gotdamn Build-a-Bear Workshop. Fuck that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI no longer have the time or the patience.\n\nAnd I\u2019m sure there is someone out there looking at me who will say, \u201cShe has potential, but nah,\u201d and by all means, I encourage you to skip over me if potential is not your ministry, either. We too grown for this shit now.\n\n3. Explanations\n\nI\u2019m tired of explaining shit to dudes that they have probably already heard before and should already understand. Ain\u2019t no mo\u2019 explaining. If I am \u201cthe second person to tell\u201d you that, then you have heard it before and should have already been doing your homework. You are too old for me to be explaining to you why it\u2019s not OK for you to just pop up over my house. I don\u2019t care if you are calling from around the corner\u2014if we did not prearrange for you to come over and visit, the answer is \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith every \u201cno\u201d I give, there undoubtedly comes a \u201cWhy?\u201d I\u2019m done with \u201cwhy\u201d and done with explaining.\n\n\u201cNo\u201d is a complete fucking answer. Period. It requires no further explanation.\n\n4. \u201cFriends\u201d With No \u201cBenefits\u201d\n\nI was kinda already on this in 2017, but I am making a stronger commitment to it in 2018. Dudes are always surprised when they ask me if we can be friends with benefits, and I ask them what the benefit is. Just so we are clear: Dick is not the benefit. It never has been and it never will be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPenises are like buses. Another one will be here in 10 minutes or less. So what else you got? Are you handy around the house? Are you good with cars? Can you hook my friend up with illegal cable? Can you put in on some of these bills? Like, what do you have to offer besides what\u2019s between your legs? I need answers. And real fucking benefits.\n\n5. Insecure Dudes\n\nThis last one is a biggie. I\u2019ve encountered it enough times to be sick of it. Usually I try to encourage dudes or make them feel better, but now I\u2019m like, fuck that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am a Leo, and a gregarious, outgoing person by nature. I have a large following on Twitter, and now that I write for The Root, I have a large platform that brings me a lot of attention. I flirt. A lot. Flirting is harmless. It doesn\u2019t mean I want to date the object of the flirting or have sex with them or anything like that. Sometimes flirting is just flirting. In fact, a lot of times flirting is just flirting.\n\nI have had dudes who approached me because they like my outgoing, flirtatious personality suddenly feel some type of way when they get closer to me. They want me to turn down my personality and dim my light so that they feel more comfortable.\n\nTheir level of insecurity is not really my concern or my business; that\u2019s something for them to work out on their own time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere I used to try to be understanding and would often tone some things down to make them more comfortable, I realized that is changing who I am for another person, and again, FUCK THAT.\n\nSo insecure dudes have to go, too.\n\nIn summation, I had a glorious 2017, and I expect that 2018 is going to be even better. It is with that in mind that I make these changes, knowing that they will facilitate my happy new year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI hope you had a chance to think of some changes to make for yourself, too.\n\nHappy New Year!", "keywords": ["playing", "2017", "leaving", "dudes", "things", "work", "fresh", "potential", "think", "shit", "starting", "2018", "im", "flirting"], "polarity": 0.012024936868686869, "subjectivity": 0.5742025162337664},

For some, it will be the last night they can stay up as late as they want before starting out a new year at work Tuesday morning.\n\n\n\nThey say the way you bring in your new year is indicative of how you will spend the year, so bringing in the new year by having a romantic evening with your love (or someone you are into) is a perfect way to start things off right, right?\n\nNow, if you are going to do this, then please do it right. If you put a half-assed effort into it, your love life for the new year is probably going to look half-assed as well. Get off to a good start.\n\nSee what I did there?\n\nHere are some tips:\n\nCreate a playlist of all your favorite sexy and mood-enhancing songs. I personally have a playlist that is specifically for boning, and I know I am not alone in this. Crank that baby up and play it throughout the evening on repeat. Include plenty of Prince slow songs (they all nassy!) and Marvin Gaye at his wailing best.\n\nA romantic picnic in the middle of your living room on a thick, soft blanket or even in the middle of your bed would definitely set the right tone. Eat enough to feel satisfied, but not so much that you can\u2019t participate in the action later. The meal you eat should be delicious, but not one that is overly heavy or one that will lead to unfortunate side effects like painful gas and bloating. None of that is sexy, and none of that will lend itself well to a night that ends with good sex. Think light finger foods that you feed each other.\n\nGet a few good bottles of wine. Avoid heavy alcohol because while it may sound good in theory, if you have ever suffered your way through vodka or whiskey dick, you know that this is not ever a good idea. A good, full-bodied wine such as malbec or merlot will be good to give you just the right amount of buzz without turning the evening into a drunken nightmare. Drunken sex is just not very sexy.\n\nGet the ambience and atmosphere right. Dim the lights and make use of scented candles. The most popular store for body products and household scented items is having a huge sale right now, and its three-wick candles are currently only $10 each. Run over and get a few, but make sure the scents are not heavy\u2014just light enough to tickle the nose and give the house a good aroma. An alternative to candles is night-lights. I know you may not have used them since you were a kid, but strategically placed night-lights can create a romantic mood without being intrusive.\n\nWear something sexy. It doesn\u2019t have to be lingerie\u2014it could be that romper you got on sale after Thanksgiving and have been waiting for warmer weather to wear. Wear something to be peeled out of. Make it an adventure for your partner. Give your partner something to look at and something to do later. It will be fun for both of you.\n\nRemember that foreplay is important for both of you and can be the best part of the evening. Make a game out of it. Test the limits of each other\u2019s nerve endings. Bring in the new year discovering or rediscovering your partner\u2019s body.\n\nHave whatever protection you are going to use close by. Nothing is more of a mood killer than fumbling around to try to find the protection. If you are planning to use condoms, have them set out already in a cute, decorative bowl near your love nest. Make them easily accessible and readily available. And have plenty of them. This could be a long night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is just one of many ways to have a good night on New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nHowever you choose to spend it, and whomever you choose to spend it with, be safe and have fun.\n\nAnd remember that when you come home from that first day back at work in 2018, The Root After Dark will be here to keep you company that night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHappy New Year!", "keywords": ["romantic", "eve", "spend", "good", "know", "sexy", "happy", "evening", "night", "love", "way", "right"], "polarity": 0.23952009528932613, "subjectivity": 0.5187538956769726},

I doubt she gave much of a damn about the grade of barbecue sauce purchased with the tray of boneless chicken wings or the fancy new Pack 'n Play her grandmother bought her. And I know she gave no fucks about the party's superhero motif, because the first thing she did when seeing the bedazzled Batman shirt I wore was attempt to eat the bat.\n\nI'm not much of a party person myself, but I looked forward to this day just to be able to witness her experiencing it. Her face when opening and playing with her gifts. (Which, as usual for her, landed somewhere between slightly bemused and slightly annoyed. My daughter is British, apparently.) Her eyes when she heard the \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d song sung to her for the first time. Her tiny legs as she walked from the cake stand to the couch her cousin was sitting on. And those same tiny legs an hour later when she apparently forgot she actually knows how to walk now and just started crawling everywhere.\n\nShe is my Feminist Octopus \u2014 a name I\u2019ve given her because her favorite words currently are \u201cstop\u201d and \u201cno.\u201d And also because she\u2019s so damn curious and engaged with her surroundings that it\u2019s like she had eight limbs; all simultaneously grabbing and touching and pulling and pinching. I know it\u2019s not the most creative nickname, but I\u2019m her dad and I\u2019m allowed to be corny.\n\nOur house right now is an emporium of random baby shit shoehorned into an adult living space. It's like someone went to Babies R Us, emptied 20 shelves into 50 different bags, drove to IKEA, and arbitrarily sprinkled the bags' content throughout the store; a GRACO easy fold highchair parked adjacent to the living room mantle and both the fireplace underneath it and the 65 inch Sony 4K Ultra HD TV on top of it; Chicka Chicka Boom Boom laying on a SV\u00c4RTAN limited edition collection tray table. When babies arrive to couples who've never had children before, their presence is a colonization. A welcome colonization of course. A colonization with footies and frequent viewings of Sesame Street on YouTube (in Spanish though because we want her to learn that too). But a colonization nonetheless. Your resources are devoted to them, your thoughts possessed with them, your instincts stirred by them.\n\nAnd its with this context that killings such as the killing of Joe McKnight are so fucking brutal. So fucking complete. Not necessarily to me. I, like many others who heard of the circumstances surrounding his death, felt an appropriate amount of outrage, sadness, and perplexity. But I wasn't devastated by it the same way the grandmother who rented the space for his first birthday party 27 years ago, the uncle who first taught him out to catch a football, and the mom and the dad who had their lives upended and colonized by him 28 years are most definitely today. I can't conjure many fates more cruel than to have a life that was treasured, prayed over, sacrificed for, led, and loved snatched away so senselessly. And for everyone \u2014 including the police \u2014 to know exactly who did it. And for that person to be free. As if those decades of memories and moments and gallons of formula and refilled diaper genies and doctors' office visits and Polaroids of first steps meant nothing. Like none of that mattered. Like it didn't even happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIts no secret that the undervaluing of Black lives isn't as much about a conscious and seething racial animus but more the inability to regard us as fully human; a dynamic that manifests as a reluctance to give our capacity to hurt, bleed, double over in pain, and die any benefit of the doubt. Its not that our lives and the diversity of life within each of our lives don't matter at all. They just don't matter as much. And for Black men and Black women as strong and sturdy and brown as Joe McKnight was, this modicum of empathy becomes nonexistent. He's been \"grown\" his entire life; a \"man\" since before he could ride a bike; a threat since before he could spell. Perhaps Ronald Gasser will eventually be arrested, charged, and convicted of his murder. But his freedom today \u2014 that he's receiving a consideration, a benefit of the doubt, that Joe McKnight did not, could not, and would never have \u2014 synopsizes America's feelings about men and women like the one he killed and the broken and brutalized families they leave behind; communicating to them and to us that those birthday parties didn't matter.

Sometimes there are extra twists like a secret wife he never talked about, a horde of children he pretended not to have, a pallet on the floor in his mama\u2019s basement he pretended not to be sleeping on. The details may change, but the cautionary tale remains the same.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is just one of them.\n\nMagnolia, Gardenia and Lily (not their real names, of course) met through Jeremiah the Liar\u2019s (not his real name, either) timeline. The three of them took an instant liking to one another and began mutually following and engaging on the timeline. Jokes and laughs were shared, memes passed along and good times had by all.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGardenia had known Jeremiah the Liar the longest. They had four years of \u201cfriendship\u201d under their belt that began prior to her ever being on Twitter. He openly flirted with her and engaged in conversations of a sexual nature. He had expressed his attraction to her and the feeling was mutual, but she was never fully emotionally invested because, in her words, \u201csomething just didn\u2019t seem right.\u201d\n\nLily met Jeremiah the Liar next. They worked in the same creative field. They also had an attraction to each other. She gave him her phone number and they began texting each other frequently, sharing flirtatious messages as he had done with Gardenia. She thought he was a cool dude and a good friend.\n\nMagnolia was the last to meet Jeremiah the Liar. She was completely unaware of his existence until he DM\u2019d her one day. Their interactions were the slowest to get going, but once they did\u2014it was full-court press. They talked every day for months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeparately, all three women started noticing little things about Jeremiah the Liar that just didn\u2019t seem right.\n\nGIF\n\nGardenia realized that whenever she mentioned coming to visit him again, he always stalled her. Lily was taken aback when he got super upset for no apparent reason after she made the sweet gesture of surprising him with a giant bag of his favorite candy in the mail. Magnolia couldn\u2019t understand why he never seemed to be able to take time off from work to do anything. It was all very odd.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll three noticed that while he was super open about a great many things, he was very secretive about others.\n\nSomething wasn\u2019t right.\n\nAs luck would have it, the three women were all members of a topical group chat. Magnolia was talking in the chat about another male friend of hers, and she mentioned Jeremiah the Liar\u2019s name. Both Gardenia and Lily immediately spoke up and said they both thought he was full of shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nThe three women spent the next several hours comparing notes. Several things came to light:\n\nThrough a lie of omission, Jeremiah the Liar had deceived all three women about a very important fact of his life\u2014something that would have made a huge difference in the way all three women dealt with him.\n\nAt some point the women noticed that the level of flirtation Jeremiah was using to engage with each of them had more than a hint of sexual tension, and they called him on it.\n\nOver the last few months, he had spent a great amount of effort denying any wrongdoing, while still trying to pit the three women against one another. He told Magnolia that he was not involved with Lily and she was making sexual jokes with him on the timeline out of \u201cnowhere.\u201d He told Gardenia that Magnolia was forcing him to choose between the two of them. He told Lily that he only talked to Magnolia about business, and there was nothing else between them.\n\nHe repeatedly ran between the three women dropping nuggets of incendiary gossip of the \u201cshe said, she said\u201d type in what the women imagine was an attempt to make them openly fight over him. No one took the bait.\n\nIn case that last part was too long or unclear, Jeremiah the Liar is basically a messy bitch who lives for drama.\n\n\n\nNothing about how this fraud presented himself either online or in their private conversations was real\u2014not even his name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nMagnolia was the first to confront him with the truth. He told her that unlike with her, the conversations he had with the other two women were \u201ctrivial\u201d and didn\u2019t extend beyond texting here and there. He wasn\u2019t as into them as he was her, and he didn\u2019t see his relationships with them as being real.\n\n\n\nMagnolia told him that he was full of shit. She told him that he was wild and reckless and that he needed to talk to the other two women and be honest about what he had been doing. She told him he needed to own it. He \u201capologized\u201d and said he would.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe called Gardenia later that night and told her that of the three women, she was the one he had been the most honest with. She knew more of his truth than the other two did. He apologized to her for being \u201cwild and reckless.\u201d He didn\u2019t mean for that to happen.\n\nGardenia told him that his behavior was pathological and he needed to seek help. Then she hung up on him.\n\nThe next morning, Jeremiah the Liar called Lily. He told her that he had apologized to both Gardenia and Magnolia. She openly confronted him about the personal information the three women had discovered about him. He admitted to some of it, then asked her why he couldn\u2019t decide what personal information he shared with people online.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt ceased being an online conversation when you moved it off of Twitter and onto our phones,\u201d she advised him.\n\nJeremiah the Liar played the victim and told her he was just trying to apologize. He said he would understand if none of them ever talked to him again. He didn\u2019t mean for any of this to happen.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe three women decided as a group to go against normal Twitter protocol. They would not expose him or air him out on the timeline. None of them wanted to be part of a messy Twitter drama saga, and none of them wanted harm to come to the innocent people who could be collateral damage if they were to do such a thing.\n\n\n\nHe was spared the embarrassment.\n\nThe moral of the story is, as I said earlier, this is a very common occurrence on Twitter. There are plenty of men who are single on the timeline and married in real life. Single on the timeline with a girlfriend hiding in the wings. Single on the timeline and engaging in extensive private conversations with multiple women behind the scenes, none of whom know about the others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s messy. Their lack of honesty often leads to multiple people getting hurt.\n\nThe reasons they do this are many. Some, like SpongeBob Pajama Pants, have low self-esteem and get off on the idea of multiple women wanting them. Some are just bored and looking for the attention they aren\u2019t getting in their real life. Some are emotionally manipulative, egocentric assholes who thrive on this type of behavior.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll are emotionally immature boys in man bodies who don\u2019t think far enough to realize how their actions impact the real-life people on the other side of those interactions.\n\n\n\nSo, ladies, pay attention. Look for the signs. If something seems like it\u2019s not right, it probably isn\u2019t. If he seems too secretive or you believe that he is withholding information, approach with caution.\n\nDon\u2019t let yourself be the next Magnolia, Gardenia or Lily.\n\nBeware of the lying Twitter man-whore.", "keywords": ["magnolia", "told", "lying", "jeremiah", "liar", "didnt", "women", "timeline", "lily", "twitter", "manwhore", "gardenia", "caught", "beware"], "polarity": 0.11316115702479342, "subjectivity": 0.4529122392758754},

OK, I will concede that I took her tweet out of context, so y\u2019all can stop tweeting me about that now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe other interesting take that showed up in my mentions, however, was the idea that I was lying about being happily single. There\u2019s no way I could be happy, they told me, because all single people are secretly craving a relationship; they just lie to themselves to make themselves feel better.\n\nIt all made me wonder\u2014do people realize that \u201csingle\u201d means alone, not lonely?\n\nI am single by choice. I\u2019m not sitting over here wishing I had a man to keep me company\u2014quite the contrary.

To be honest, the single, nonmonogamous life just works out better for me. Not just because of the built-in variety, but because I don\u2019t have to be bothered when I don\u2019t want to be.\n\nI enjoy my solitude. I live in a Hollywood studio apartment. It\u2019s a very nice studio, and because it\u2019s older, it\u2019s a very nice size\u2014but it\u2019s just enough room in here for me. I cannot imagine having to share this space with another person. I don\u2019t even like company that much.\n\nSometimes I don\u2019t feel like talking to anyone at all. I just want to sit here in my panties, no bra, listen to my music and do me. I spend all day writing, and that takes a lot of brainpower. When I\u2019m ready to shut down, I\u2019m ready to shut the fuck down, and having to consider another person\u2019s needs in that would probably drive me bonkers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause keeping it real, I am busy being an amazing writer. The Root keeps me busy all day and all night. Even when I\u2019m not online, I\u2019m online looking up stuff, researching, finding new angles and thinking of things I can write about that will be interesting for our readers.\n\nI eat, sleep and breathe writing. It takes up most of my time. I also have other outside projects and endeavors that hold my interest. I am very comfortable with the company of self. It gives me time to work on my creative projects and fiction writing\u2014things I don\u2019t get to do during the day when I\u2019m writing for work.\n\nI recently attended a panel with Shonda Rhimes during which she said: \u201cI\u2019ve always been a person who lives in my imagination. I\u2019ve never been lonely. You can\u2019t be lonely if you have that kind of imagination and enjoy spending time in it. The made-up world is a way of bringing order to the real world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI related to that statement on a personal level. Most creative people are able to spend long periods of time alone without missing being around other people because the silence of self helps to birth the best ideas. I can flesh them out easier. They come to me faster.\n\nMy main focus right now is my career. I am at a high point right now, and I know that I will only grow from here, but that growth will only happen if I remain focused.\n\nI am single by choice. I am childless by choice. I don\u2019t even have a pet, because the level of responsibility seems to be a bit much for me right now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can live as selfishly as I want and not have to think about it. I make decisions based on what I want to do, and I don\u2019t have to worry about how someone else is going to feel about it. If I want to pack up tomorrow and move to Paris or Barcelona, I can do that. I don\u2019t have anything weighing me down or tying me to where I am right now.\n\nThis is about personal choices, and single is the personal choice I have made for myself.\n\nSingle. Alone.

For his part, Felix said he had nothing to do with the Trump campaign. News of the Moscow real estate deal came to light this week after democrats on the House Intelligence Committee released a status report outlining dozens of leads they say they could not pursue after the republicans shut down the committee\u2019s investigation, according to Business Insider.\n\nHere is a rundown of how Sater was pursuing the Moscow deal, per Business Insider:\n\nSater and Trump\u2019s longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, were pushing for the deal with VTB in Moscow at the height of the presidential election, in late 2015 and early 2016. The revelation will likely draw sharp scrutiny from the special counsel Robert Mueller, who recently subpoenaed the Trump Organization for documents related to the Trump Tower Moscow deal. Sater first sent a non-binding letter of intent to Cohen outlining the terms of the \u201cTrump World Tower Moscow\u201d deal on October 13, 2015, The New York Times previously reported. Andrey Rozov, a Russian investor, had already signed it by the time Sater forwarded it to Cohen, and Trump signed the letter. Weeks later, the two men exchanged a series of emails gearing up to celebrate the Trump Tower Moscow deal. In the emails, obtained by The Times, Sater bragged about his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and told Cohen he would \u201cget all of Putins team to buy in\u201d on the deal. \u201cOur boy can become president of the USA and we can engineer it,\u201d Sater wrote, according to The Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBesides being a Trump associate, Sater spent the past two decades as a top US intelligence asset for the DIA, CIA and the FBI. He even claims to have pursued high-level terrorists \u2014 including Osama bin Laden.\n\nHe won\u2019t say whether or not he has been interviewed by Mueller. But it is very likely that Mueller is well aware of Sater\u2019s intelligence work because he was the FBI Director during much of the time he was working for the feds.", "keywords": ["claims", "russian", "election", "vtb", "sanctioned", "cohen", "sater", "bank", "mueller", "trump", "moscow", "pursued", "tower", "likely", "deal", "organization", "felix"], "polarity": 0.06828567055839785, "subjectivity": 0.35109974200883287},

As I do on our main site, I like to engage with the readers in the comments. As I read through what people were saying, I noticed a disturbing pattern: A great number of men were criticizing me for talking about twerking. They said that I should be focused on more important things than just shaking my ass.\n\nIf you have followed me here for even a week, you know that I write about a great many topics on The Root. The Root After Dark is just a space where I get to express a different side of myself. I get to cut loose from all the politics and negative news that can at times be draining, especially for someone who has to be constantly tuned in to it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was insulted by the insinuation that I didn\u2019t have more to add to people\u2019s day. It left me wondering a few things: Why aren\u2019t black women allowed to own their sexuality? Why are the only acceptable sexual depictions of black women those that are defined by people other than black women? Why is it that, when we embrace our sexuality or\u2014as I do here each night\u2014openly express it, we are labeled whores or sluts or too sexual? Why are we immediately dismissed, as if black women were not the multidimensional, multitalented, creative and expressive embodiments of #BlackGirlMagic that we are on a daily basis?\n\nIt\u2019s not just our own people who do this to us, but it is worst when our own people do this to us, at least in my opinion. By \u201cour own people,\u201d I mean black men. Why are you so threatened by a black woman owning her sexuality? What is it about a black woman who is expressing her sexuality that makes a black man feel that he has to tear her down for it?\n\nOn the one hand, every rap video wants us dressed in the skimpiest clothing possible, shaking our asses and acting as if we\u2019re dying to lay up with MC Misogyny at the first opportunity. The other side of that game is, if I put on a skimpy outfit and pose on Instagram, I am a thot or a ho and I need to find something better to do with my time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was totally OK, even celebrated, for Elizabeth Taylor\u2014a white woman\u2014to run through a passel of husbands. Something was wrong with those men, not with her. But Halle Berry having more than one relationship means something is definitely wrong with her.\n\nMake up your mind, men.\n\nYou wanted Twerk Team to keep posting videos on YouTube a few years ago, but grown black women twerking on Twitter or Facebook is too much for you.\n\nYou want \u201cwifey\u201d material. She has to be pure and innocent but also know how to suck your dick the right way and throw it back at you as you hit it from behind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose two things don\u2019t even match. Just what is it that you really want?\n\nI am a college-educated black woman who was trained in traditional journalism. I write news for The Root on a daily basis. I give detailed and succinct political commentary. I curate important information for our readers daily. I engage in intelligent discourse with the Kinja commenters. I read a lot of books and I have a rather large vocabulary.\n\nI am also a black woman who fully embraces her sexuality. I love sex. I love looking sexy. I talk about sex because I don\u2019t think it is anything to be ashamed of. Sometimes I dress conservatively. Sometimes I dress with my body parts hanging out. It just depends on my mood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bottom line is, you can\u2019t have the woman and remove her sexuality. Her sexuality is a part of her. Black women are sexual beings. We live full lives, have fabulous careers, hold our people down and save everyone else in the process.\n\nAnd we do it all while managing active and healthy sex lives. We do it all in business suits and rompers. We do it all for the \u2019gram and for the boardroom.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to like it, but you don\u2019t have to be afraid of it.\n\nAnd you damn well better start accepting it, because we outchea.\n\nBe blessed,\n\nA sexual black woman", "keywords": ["sex", "damned", "woman", "things", "dont", "sexual", "women", "root", "men", "black", "sexuality"], "polarity": 0.10881358424461876, "subjectivity": 0.5530512750340336},

I actually have two: one I call the \u201cRatchet\u201d playlist and the other called \u201cLet\u2019s Twerk.\u201d They are my guilty pleasures.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of crossover between the two lists, but both of them have been in steady rotation over the past week. In particular, Yo Gotti\u2019s \u201cRake It Up\u201d and Cardi B\u2019s \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d have been the theme songs that have gotten me going every day, and that made me want to make a list of some of my current favorite twerk anthems.\n\nHere they are, in no particular order:\n\n1. \u201cRake It Up,\u201d by Yo Gotti\n\n\u201cI tell my hos rake it up. Break it down. Back it up. Fuck it up. Back it up. Rake it up.\u201d The opening lines are an instruction manual for how you should dance when this song comes on. Not to mention, he calls it a \u201cstrip club anthem.\u201d Yo Gotti is telling you to get out there, shake that ass, back it up, fuck it up and rake up the money that gets thrown at you in the process. How can you not? My ass immediately starts swinging in a circle when this comes on, and this week, as I said, it\u2019s been on a lot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cNo Limit,\u201d by G-Eazy, Featuring A$AP Rocky and Cardi B\n\n\u201cFuck with me and get some money.\u201d I\u2019ll admit that Cardi B\u2019s verse makes this song for me, but white boy Gerald is pretty OK on the mic as well. This is one of those bounce-your-ass-up-and-down-real-fast songs, and that\u2019s just what I do when it comes on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \u201cMercy,\u201d by Kanye West, Featuring Big Sean, Pusha T and 2 Chainz\n\nThis is an oldie but a goodie. It\u2019s still a damn goodie. My favorite thing to do is switch the direction of my waist wine every time Big Sean says, \u201cSwerve.\u201d I performed a dance for one of my man friends to this song, and he loved the \u201cswerve\u201d move. It worked out that night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cBodak Yellow,\u201d by Cardi B\n\nI changed the hook on this to say, \u201cI don\u2019t freelance no more, I make money moves,\u201d and it applies. I love this song because Cardi is talking about her come-up over the last year, and I relate. My come up as a writer over the last year has been similar, and while I am eternally grateful for those who helped me get here\u2014\u201cWhat bitch working hard as me?\u201d I feel it in my soul.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. \u201cMoney Money Money,\u201d by Red Cafe\n\nAnother oldie but goodie. I like this song because you have to really have the skills to make your ass clap to this, and I do. This song is still amazing; don\u2019t @ me. It will always be on my list.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. \u201cMotorSport,\u201d by Migos, Featuring Cardi B and Nicki Minaj\n\n\u201cYou heard she gon\u2019 do what to who? That\u2019s not a reliable source, so tell me have you seen her, let me wrap my weave up, I\u2019m the trap Selena, dame mas gasolina!\u201d Obviously Cardi is my favorite part of this song, too. Like, I legit turn it off when Nicki comes on and skip to the next song on my list. Cardi really said \u201cRide the dick like a BMX,\u201d though, and I\u2019m here for that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. \u201cMy Chick Bad Remix,\u201d by Ludacris, Featuring Diamond, Eve, Trina\n\nThis song aged well. Especially Eve\u2019s verse, since she married a damn billionaire. I love this song because the women are unabashedly loving themselves, and I feel powered up when I rap and dance along to this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. \u201cScarred,\u201d by Uncle Luke, Featuring Trick Daddy\n\nThis is an OG twerk song. Luke started the movement; he fathered all these others. My knees are bad now from dropping it low to this song so much in the \u201990s. Get into it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. \u201cLove Me for Free,\u201d by Akinyele\n\nOK, so this may not necessarily be a twerk anthem. It\u2019s more of a two-step song, but two-stepping and rapping along to these raunchy-ass lyrics is the real winner. I couldn\u2019t find a version with the real lyrics, \u201cFuck me for free,\u201d but this will do, pig. This will do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. \u201cNo Hands,\u201d by Waka Flocka Flame, Featuring Wale, Roscoe Dash\n\nRaise your hand if you can drop it to the floor and bounce it, with no hands. This song will forever exist on both of my lists, most especially because of Wale\u2019s verse. I don\u2019t care about the other two dudes on the song, but when it gets to Wale\u2019s part, I lose my shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo there you have it. A list of some of my current twerk anthems. I volunteered to send my editor, The Root Managing Editor Genetta Adams, a video demonstrating what \u201cthrow that ass in a circle\u201d means, but she declined.\n\nWhat do you like to throw your ass in a circle to?

Is that still a thing?\n\nTo be clear, most times when this was and is talked about, it\u2019s in reference to women and never men. No one ever looks down on the man who \u201cgets some\u201d on the first date, but the woman who \u201cgives it up\u201d on the first date is considered \u201ceasy\u201d or a \u201cho\u201d for doing what she wants with her body.\n\nSuch arguments are steeped in religion and patriarchy. A woman\u2019s body is considered her greatest virtue, and giving it to anyone but her husband would be the worst thing she could ever do. In fact, women who assume agency over their own bodies are frowned upon for just about anything; you can see this evidenced whenever the infamous \u201cbody count\u201d discussion comes up on Twitter.\n\nThere are those who believe that a woman who has sex with a man on the first date will never be taken seriously by him. Never mind that they are two consenting adults who participated with each other in the same activity. She is the one who is looked down upon. It\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nA lot of people have deeply religious backgrounds, and the church has given people a lot of unnecessary hangups where sex is concerned. You can\u2019t touch yourself and learn your own body, and you damn sure can\u2019t let anyone else touch it and learn it. Sexual repression and abstinence are the gospel, and in a lot of cases, that can lead to unhealthy sexual ideation and behaviors later in life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am of the belief that it\u2019s up to the two people involved whether or not they want to bump uglies on the first date, but I am a woman who has participated in a one-night stand or two, and I see nothing wrong with it as long as you practice safe sex.\n\nWhat happens when you are out for the first time and the vibe is incredibly strong? What happens when both of you are feeling that attraction that pulls your pelvises together like magnets?\n\nAny man who will have sex with you on the first date, then claim not to respect you after the fact, is a hypocrite. Sir, you did it, too. What makes you above reproach, if we are judging at all?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSexual exploration is a big part of being an adult. Consenting adults should be allowed to do whatever they want with each other as long as they do so willingly and safely.\n\nSex on the first date can be an icebreaker. You\u2019ve gotten some of the awkwardness out of the way. You have determined whether or not you are sexually compatible. You can move on to the freak shit on the next date.\n\nOr not. Either way, it\u2019s completely up to you. Other people\u2019s opinions on it should not ever be a consideration in what you, as an adult, choose to do with your body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was curious about this topic, though, so I posted a poll on Twitter to see what my followers and their friends thought about it.\n\nOf the 546 people who took the time to answer the survey, 83 percent said that they believed sex on the first date was fine. A small group, 17 percent, believed that people should wait before having sex.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI asked people to expand on their answers if they were willing to be quoted for this column.\n\nOne gentleman said that he believed sex on the first date was a bad idea if you were looking to get into a relationship. I asked him why, and another person responded and said because sex clouds your judgment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI get that people can be dickmatized, but if that is your problem, you probably have some other shit to work out besides whether or not you should have sex on the first date.\n\nNot that I am above or talking down on people who have been or are currently dickmatized, because bitch, I know the struggle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was a gentleman who said he\u2019s never done it but that he is all for it because he wants a preview of things to come.\n\nThere were more than a few married women who responded to my query and said that not only had they had sex on the first date, but they eventually married the man with whom they had the first-date sex, which dispels the assumption that men won\u2019t see value in a woman who lies down with them on the first date.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were plenty of people who believed you should do what you want to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bottom line here is simple\u2014do what feels right for you. In the end, you don\u2019t owe anyone an explanation for your actions or your choices. They are personal.\n\nThe idea that sex on the first date will preclude anyone, most especially a woman, from finding long-term loving relationships is dumb and needs to go away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is at times like these that I remember a motto I repeat over and over again on Twitter:\n\nMind your own pussy.", "keywords": ["sex", "woman", "lot", "1st", "considered", "believed", "women", "date", "body", "way", "man", "yes"], "polarity": 0.10829314848302188, "subjectivity": 0.5099809121961022},

She had a sexual encounter with a man who knew absolutely nothing about foreplay. He kissed her one or two times, slid into her without even making sure she was ready, and finished his little \u201cact\u201d all within two minutes. It was all bad.\n\nIt led us to discussing what do men think constitutes foreplay and how if only they realized foreplay is the key to a good sexual experience for everyone, we might not hold it against them so much when they fall short of our expectations in other areas.\n\nOK, maybe we would still hold it against them, but we would give them lots of points for their effort during the preamble. So that got me to thinking about all the things lots of men don\u2019t know, but could probably stand to learn, about foreplay.\n\nThis is a primer, so print it out and tape it to your mirror or your refrigerator or someplace you can see it daily and commit it to memory, fellas. This one is for you.\n\n1. Please realize that foreplay is about more than getting her \u201cwet\u201d so you can slide in.\n\nIt\u2019s about creating a level of intimacy, even with partners you have been with before. It\u2019s about setting up the perfect sexual alley-oop. It\u2019s about the buildup before the final act. Turn her up. Make her want to give herself to you. Make her want to get freaky with you. Make her want to whip out all the tricks she\u2019s been holding back from all the other dudes she\u2019s ever been with. Make her want to bless you with her body. Give her a reason to want you badly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. It\u2019s more than just kissing her and fondling her breasts.\n\nIf she is anything like me, she may not have that much sensitivity in her breasts anyway. All my sensitivity is in my nipples and along the sides of my breasts, so if you spend all your time kissing me across the tops of them, I\u2019m going to pull my phone out and check Twitter until you\u2019re done. This is not a joke.\n\n3. Foreplay is the perfect opportunity to learn about and explore your partner\u2019s body.\n\nYou can help her find \u201cthat spot\u201d she didn\u2019t even know she had. I never knew I was supersensitive on my shoulders until an old partner kissed and bit me on them. Now? That is my biggest turn-on, and I tell everyone I\u2019m with, because I want them to use that to their advantage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKiss all her 2,000 parts. Don\u2019t be afraid to try something new. Don\u2019t be afraid to try something that worked on someone else. She\u2019ll let you know through her body\u2019s responses and audibly whether or not something is working. Find that spot that makes her yell out in ecstasy. It\u2019s what you are here for, right?\n\n4. Foreplay is the easiest way to give a woman multiple orgasms if you are unable to do so with your penis.\n\nThere are so many ways to turn a woman on. Our bodies are treasure maps just waiting to be explored and discovered. Buried in lots of little unknown spots are the keys to even the elusive squirting orgasm, but you have to be more Lewis and Clark than Columbus about your game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you are willing to travel the distance, the rewards will be great. If, however, you just want to destroy and plunder, you aren\u2019t going to get very far and probably won\u2019t be asked back. In fact, your reputation may be massacred when she discusses you with her girlfriends.\n\nYes, fellas, we have those conversations just like y\u2019all do. If you have left a woman unsatisfied, I guarantee at least five of her best girlfriends know about it, and they try to hold in their laughter whenever you are around.\n\nThat \u201cOh, this is Jerome\u201d has more to do with what we\u2019ve heard about you sexually and less to do with how good a guy she thinks you are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Foreplay has the potential to be more pleasurable and sensual than the actual intercourse itself.\n\nThis is especially true for those of you who already know your own shortcomings. Don\u2019t play her, and for the love of Venus, don\u2019t play yourself, either.\n\nDon\u2019t just stop at cunnilingus\u2014take your time with her body. Kiss her everywhere. Put your tongue everywhere. Put your fingers everywhere. Whisper to her. Look her in her eyes as you touch her. Ask her if she likes it. Ask her if she wants it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are so many erogenous zones on a woman\u2019s body. Make it a game to find five new ones every time you are with her.

Other times, we are already waist-deep in emotions and feelings before we realize that the dude has no intentions toward us, accepts no accountability for his actions and is really just wasting our time.\n\n\n\nLet me be an example for you. I\u2019ve discussed my history with the \u201cLawrence type\u201d before, but I am going to go into a bit more detail today because I think it\u2019s needed. Momo went through that so you wouldn\u2019t have to. Heed my lessons, sisters.\n\nA gentleman approached me earlier this year and suggested that we collaborate on a creative project. I agreed, and in the course of our working on the project, private messages were exchanged. We also exchanged phone numbers, and the messaging branched out to texting.\n\nI was totally consumed by someone else at that point, so I considered our exchanges to be minor flirting at best. The frequency and intensity of the messages grew over the summer, however, and we started talking on the phone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cgetting to know each other\u201d phase was sweet. He was charming, funny and smart. I found myself more and more attracted to him, and it appeared that the feeling was mutual.\n\nWhen I initially brought up taking things further, he brushed it off and said that he had some other things going on. I was confused, but he told me that he didn\u2019t object to the idea, he just wanted to clear out the other stuff first, so I acquiesced. We continued the flirtation. We continued talking every day. It got to the point where, if we didn\u2019t talk for even one day, things seemed weird\u2014to both of us.\n\nMore and more, though, I noticed that he bristled whenever I brought up the subject of taking things further again. So one day I asked him flat out, \u201cWhat are your intentions with me?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cI never thought about it.\u201d\n\nAnd there it was. This man whom I had spent hours each day for months talking with admitted that he was basically wasting my time. He didn\u2019t have any intentions with me. He just enjoyed the conversations and the attention.\n\nI was pissed\u2014both at him and at myself for ignoring the signs that were there all along. I was a fool.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA man who knows what he wants from you is going to make that clear up front. He\u2019s going to tell you. If he\u2019s serious about it, he\u2019s going to tell you repeatedly. He\u2019s not going to beat around the bush or dodge your questions about it. He will have the answers because the thing that he wants is within his grasp. He only needs you to agree with and go along with it.\n\nHe\u2019s not going to play games with accountability, and in the earlier example, saying that he had no intentions is the way that man attempted to avoid accountability.\n\nAs long as he can pretend that he is \u201cjust friends\u201d and not looking for anything more, he thinks that is a way for him not to be responsible for how he makes you feel\u2014good, bad or otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled, ladies. \u201cFriends\u201d is just a word they use to keep their toe in your pool. It\u2019s the way they are able to keep themselves in your orbit. Calling himself a friend makes it easy for him to have access to you without all the responsibility that comes with calling you his woman or girlfriend. It\u2019s the easy button. He can pretty much do what he wants, and whenever you voice an objection, he will throw that \u201cjust friends\u201d \u201cGet out of jail free\u201d card up in your face. It\u2019s bullshit.\n\nA real friend wouldn\u2019t treat you like that. If he were really your friend, and you told him that there was a man doing the things to you that he himself is doing, would he think that was OK? Ask him that. Chances are he won\u2019t answer or he will deflect instead, because he knows the truth: He\u2019s full of shit.\n\nSo what do we do, and how do we avoid letting this happen over and over again?\n\nFor me, I had to recognize that once I allowed it to happen, it became the norm. There was no need for him to change his behavior as long as I provided him an in for his performative brand of friendship. The moment I allowed myself to be a lily pad (we\u2019ll discuss this at length some other time) or a pleasant distraction or whatever it was he saw me as, that was the only thing he was going to see me as, no matter what. He didn\u2019t have to change because I wasn\u2019t changing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s at this point that you have to realize you are worth more than what you are getting so that things can and do change. First it was my initial irritation with the situation that made me create some space between us. Then it was the moment another man entered my life (HDT, for those who follow me on Twitter. We\u2019ll talk about him soon, too) who had real intentions and took real action to win me over that both I and Performative Friend Boy realized that things had changed. Flush the fuckboy behavior away and let some real light enter your life.\n\nBecause there won\u2019t be space for the real light to enter your life as long as you are allowing fuckboy behavior to have a stage on which to perform. It may sound clich\u00e9, but it\u2019s true: You are blocking your blessings that way.\n\nNo matter how much it hurts\u2014and believe me, I know how much it can hurt when you are invested in someone\u2014in the end, letting go will be much easier than carrying on with someone who doesn\u2019t have your best interests at heart. You deserve more than someone who is only looking out for himself and his selfish needs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt took me realizing that Performative Friend Boy lacked emotional intelligence and emotional maturity to truly put the nail in that coffin. I don\u2019t look at him the same, and I never will. He wasted my time. I wasted my time.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that you or I won\u2019t come across one of these dudes ever again. The growth comes in recognizing the signs and stopping the bleeding before it turns into a hemorrhage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe may not always get it right, but the more we realize our own personal value, the more likely we will be not to waste it on the wrong people.", "keywords": ["playing", "real", "day", "things", "wont", "going", "wasting", "didnt", "emotions", "intentions", "friend", "man", "hes"], "polarity": 0.16290322580645164, "subjectivity": 0.47530721966205824},

I couldn\u2019t let him go. I couldn\u2019t get him out of my system. I kept letting him back in.\n\n\n\nWe were just kids when it started. He became infatuated with me after we graduated from high school, and it grew from there.\n\nAt first I didn\u2019t give him the time of day. He was too nerdy for me. Too soft-spoken. Not gangster enough. But he treated me like a queen and put me on a high pedestal, and I eventually gave in to him. And then I fell in love.\n\nWe discovered our sex together. He put me in charge of my orgasms. We loved each other like our lives depended on it. It was deep. It was hard. It was young. And at the time, it meant everything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe eventually broke up, but we never broke away from each other. Over the course of nearly 20 years, we had the sort of push-and-pull relationship that Lauryn describes in her song. I knew he wasn\u2019t good for me, but I didn\u2019t want anyone else. He wanted to be with other people, but he couldn\u2019t cure himself of me.\n\nIs this just a silly game\n\nThat forces you to act this way?\n\nForces you to scream my name\n\nThen pretend that you can\u2019t stay\n\nTell me who I have to be\n\nTo get some reciprocity\n\nSee, no one loves you more than me\n\nAnd no one ever will.\n\nWe went back and forth for years. We hooked up repeatedly, only to later regret it. It was too emotional. Too raw. Too sexual. Too intoxicating. Too addicting.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were times when we sought each other out\u2014ran to each other, even, only to push each other way with painful words and deliberately hurtful actions. It was a game we both played with each other, one that lasted way longer than it should have.\n\nI knew all along that the relationship was toxic. I knew that no matter how many times I allowed him back into my life and back into my bed, things were not going to change. It was always going to be a thing where I screamed his name in ecstasy and later cursed it in pain.\n\nHe told me once that he felt like I had a power over him\u2014one that wouldn\u2019t let him be rid of me. He said I had a control over him that no one else did. That no matter what, he knew he would always come back, even briefly, because our connection was that strong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo matter how I think we grow\n\nYou always seem to let me know\n\nIt ain\u2019t workin\u2019 ...\n\nAnd when I try to walk away\n\nYou\u2019d hurt yourself to make me stay\n\nThis is crazy \u2026\n\nI took those words in and believed it meant that ultimately we would be together. Even as I found nonmonogamy and discovered a different lifestyle for myself, somewhere in the back of my mind, I had decided that if he ever changed his mind, I would be with him and only him ... forever.\n\n\n\nIt never worked out like that.\n\nIn the end, after hurting each other too many times for far too long, we parted ways for the last time and never looked back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t even think of him in the same way anymore. There\u2019s no hate. We are Facebook friends and follow each other on Twitter and Instagram, but our interactions are few and far between, and never do we wistfully reach out to each other in misguided moments of nostalgia.\n\nI\u2019m just glad that I don\u2019t let him back in.\n\nSo why do we let them back in?\n\nI keep letting you back in\n\nHow can I explain myself?\n\nAs painful as this thing has been\n\nI just can\u2019t be with no one else\n\nSee I know what we\u2019ve got to do\n\nYou let go, and I\u2019ll let go too\n\n\u2019Cause no one\u2019s hurt me more than you\n\nAnd no one ever will.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think a big reason is that it\u2019s hard to let go. When you have been down with someone for so long, as I was with Young Love (let\u2019s just call him that to save confusion), it\u2019s hard to let go of the them you fell in love with, even if that person is no longer there. You remember what was, and you hold on to what could be.\n\n\n\nThey become a habit, and old habits die hard. As much as we want to wean ourselves off of them, the slightest hint of them can send us spiraling back into what we already know is a bad situation.\n\nWe do it because we are hopeful. We want this time to be different. They exhibit the smallest amount of change, and we take that as a sign that they are committed to being better. We repeat the cycle of hoping for the best but bracing for the worst\u2014because ultimately, we know that it is going to end the same way it did before, and probably hurt just as much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow do we let go and stop letting them back in? I really don\u2019t have the answer for that. I still go through this myself. I recently let someone back in and immediately regretted it. I\u2019m pushing them right back out, and that is a sign to me that there\u2019s growth there. I\u2019m getting better at it.\n\nAt some point you just get tired of the cycle, and that is an evolution you can\u2019t force or perform on anyone\u2019s timetable but your own.\n\nEach time you go through it, you learn something different\u2014but so do they, so beware. They\u2019ll elevate their game when they recognize what you won\u2019t tolerate any longer, but they will only do just enough to weasel their way back in. As your sense of self-awareness grows, so will your ability to counter their actions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey will have all kinds of slick moves and slick talk for you. You will fall for some of those antics again, and some of them you will recognize for what they are and push past them.\n\nNo matter how I think we grow\n\nYou always seem to let me know\n\nIt ain\u2019t workin\u2019 ...\n\nAnd when I try to walk away\n\nYou hurt yourself to make me stay\n\nThis is crazy \u2026\n\nThe greatest piece of advice I can offer is to take time for yourself and figure out what you want. Be clear about what it is that you want. Be sure about it. Then measure him up against what it is you say you want.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t measure him up against what he was previously, because with even the smallest amount of effort, he will be able to look better to you than he did before. Using what you want is the better measure, because you can easily check off where he doesn\u2019t make the mark.\n\nTry not to be hard on yourself. We all take different amounts of time to get over things\u2014and again, no one can dictate your timetable but you. You will know when you have had enough, and when you have, you will be better able to move on.\n\nCare for me, care for me\n\nI know you care for me\n\nThere for me, there for me\n\nSaid you\u2019d be there for me\n\nCry for me, cry for me\n\nYou said you\u2019d die for me\n\nGive to me, give to me\n\nWhy won\u2019t you live for me?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCare enough for yourself to want more, though, and be self-aware enough to give yourself that.\n\n\n\nEven if it\u2019s just a little bit at a time.", "keywords": ["letting", "matter", "knew", "unable", "hard", "think", "know", "problematic", "better", "hurt", "exes", "let", "way", "times"], "polarity": 0.06572338635863226, "subjectivity": 0.4609604375587982},

Lane Bryant had an incredible sale: any single bra for $29.50. On Thanksgiving night, I bought four bras on their website. On Black Friday, I bought six more. I felt accomplished. This was a big fucking deal. I couldn\u2019t keep it to myself. I had to share it with all my ample-bosomed sistren.\n\nThe big-boob struggle is real.\n\nI wear a size 42H. My boobs have been here to stay since seventh grade. I went from completely flat-chested to a C cup virtually overnight. I never had a training bra. They went from nonexistent straight into being in the way before I was even ready. It is a family trait passed down from my grandmother. I\u2019ve learned to accept it.\n\nThe first day I realized they were going to be the thing that would always draw attention to me was the day I intercepted a note in class that was meant for someone else.\n\n\u201cIf you want to see some big ass titties, look at Monique Judge,\u201d the note read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving large breasts is both a gift and a curse. It\u2019s the first thing people notice about me. Men don\u2019t look me in the eye because their gaze is drawn to my chest. I at times get accused of accentuating my breasts, when, in fact, they are just fucking there and I can\u2019t help it.\n\nThere\u2019s the constant nagging back pain. The inability to ever go braless without looking like a lunatic. And because I have large, pendulous breasts, I am resigned to the fact that when I lie on my back, they will go their separate ways like two bitches beefing with each other.\n\nSeriously. You do not understand the struggle that is trying to wrangle these broads into the same picture when some dude asks for a photo of me without a shirt and bra on. Even with a selfie stick, that shit is a Shakespearean dramedy in 10 acts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an effort to make the best of it, I work to always wear a good, supportive bra\u2014and that is the biggest part of the struggle.\n\nIf I want a good bra that is going to provide good support and lift while not leaving my boobs dangling down by my navel, I have to spend upward of $60 a pop; $60 for one bra. I envy you A- and B-cup wearers who can walk into Victoria\u2019s Secret and buy a cute bra for $20. Her alphabet doesn\u2019t even go up to my size.\n\n\n\nNot to mention, not all big bras are created equal. Our options for good bras are limited. There are some stores out there, which will go unnamed, that will sell you an expensive-ass bra that falls apart after one or two wears.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy is it so hard to find good bras for big boobs at a good price? It\u2019s so unfair.\n\nAnd when you do find a good, supportive bra, you are suffering for aesthetics. Underwires dig into your skin, sometimes leaving bruising and scars in their wake. The straps bear the weight of your breasts (because big boobs are also very heavy; I\u2019m sure mine weigh at least 50 pounds all on their own) and leave indentations in your shoulders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBig boobs are all pain and all struggle.\n\nBut when you find a good bra that supports and lifts and makes them look good? They look good.\n\nI have had good luck with the bras I\u2019ve bought from Lane Bryant, despite the cost. They have a few lines that I absolutely love, including one I recently discovered that is now a standout favorite. They have a wide range of sizes from 32DD up to 50DDD. They also have large cup sizes including F, G and H. Here are a few of my favorites from them:\n\nFirst of all, you cannot go wrong with the Lane Bryant full-coverage bra. It offers great support and comes in a wide variety of colors. There are also lined, lightly lined and unlined options. My favorite is the cotton no-wire, unlined option. My boobs sit straight up in this bra. There is a ton of support, and the bra is not killing me by the end of the day. This bra is currently my favorite for everyday wear. It\u2019s just an all-around good bra.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you want to have some sexy with your support, I recommend either the balconette line or the plunge line. I wore the cotton boost plunge bra recently at The Root 100 gala, and all night, people were telling me how delicious my boobs looked.\n\nFinally, the T-shirt bras are soft, comfortable and come in a few different fits. I like that they come in a bunch of colors, and you can find matching panties for them if that is your thing.\n\nThe big-titty struggle is indeed real, but you are not alone, my sisters. I\u2019m here with you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you got \u2019em, flaunt \u2019em. Get a sponsor and get some good bras and let those girls flourish.\n\nI will be there to let you know when a good bra sale is happening.\n\n*Shimmies.*", "keywords": ["bras", "real", "wear", "look", "bigboob", "good", "support", "bra", "big", "breasts", "struggle", "boobs"], "polarity": 0.19956072351421186, "subjectivity": 0.4994324473975638},

I want to expand on and perhaps correct my stance on that if possible.\n\nI love big dicks and I cannot lie. There is nothing in the world quite like the feeling of a man with both length and girth filling you up until you can\u2019t take anymore.

It\u2019s an oxymoron.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne day in September, I asked the ladies of the Twitter timeline to tell me of their worst experience of a dude with a big one not being up for the challenge, and I got a lot of responses, but this one in particular sums it all up:\n\n\n\nIn short (heh), size only matters if you know what the fuck you are doing with it. You can\u2019t be out here wasting women\u2019s time with your big thang if you have no stroke game\u2014or worst yet, a quick fucking draw.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is a gentleman I had to kick off my hotation roster earlier this year because he was guilty of the big-bat-strikeout crime.\n\nThis man was working with a smooth 9 1/2 inches of girthy, godly goodness and had the weakest stroke imaginable. That shit was equivalent to a Facebook poke\u2014that is to say, it was fucking nonexistent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was so disappointed. I wanted him to be great. He, apparently, did not want himself to be great. How do you reach 40 years of age with all that pipe and not learn how to use it? This man had been married, for fuck\u2019s sake. Twice! I just don\u2019t get it.\n\nGIF\n\nAnd here\u2019s another thing: Don\u2019t be out here catfishing us on the size of your dick or your stroke game. You are asking for giggles and chuckles in the bedroom with that shit. Let me give you an example.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll right, so boom. I used to work with this guy who had a really nice body. He was muscular, but not overly so. He was the right amount of thick. He looked like he would be able to handle this load if I were to throw it on his ass. I was curious, and after a while, I found out he was, too.\n\nAfter we spent a month or so flirting back and forth, his comments began to get more and more overtly sexual. He kept saying he was going to \u201cbreak my back\u201d and things like that. In retrospect, that should have been my first clue. Most dudes with big thangs and good stroke don\u2019t have to do a whole lot of talking about it. The proof is in the pudding.\n\nIn any case, after about the 20,340,239,840,238,420,348th comment about how good he could give it to me, I was like, \u201cOK, you don\u2019t have to talk me to damn death. What\u2019s good?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe made arrangements for him to come over to my apartment after his shift at work.\n\nI went home and did the usual prep. I scented my sheets, changed the light bulb, bathed and got myself all lotioned up and smelling good, and waited for him to arrive.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen he did, we didn\u2019t waste any time, because why? We went right into my bedroom to do what he came to do.\n\n\n\nAs we are lying there and he is fumbling his way through a most mediocre foreplay performance (ooh, another post idea for another day, \u2019cause some of y\u2019all fucking suck at foreplay), I reach my hand down to his crotch to give it the size test.\n\nI am alarmed, because I don\u2019t feel much of anything. I think to myself that maybe he just isn\u2019t very aroused yet\u2014and then I feel insulted because, bitch, I\u2019m ME.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut whatever. I push forward. I tell him to take his pants off, and he does, providing me with better access to the anaconda he is supposedly wielding. I reach down to grab it, and the slippery little worm is barely worth me using all my fingers to hold. I could have legit just rubbed him with my thumb and forefinger and he would have been just fine. Now I\u2019m pissed.\n\nGIF\n\nHe starts to get harder, if that is even such a thing for someone with his limited scope, and apparently he is ready because he asks me, \u201cDo you have any condoms?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithout missing a beat, I say, \u201cYes, but they\u2019re Magnums.\u201d\n\nMy smart-ass comment flies over his head the way size flew over his dick, and he asks me to give him one.\n\nI do it, against my better judgment.\n\nHe gets a good six or seven strokes in before he blows his load, just like he is blowing this sexual experience for me. Then, to add insult to injury, he pulls out\u2014pulling his miniature member out of the condom as he does so. The condom, having done its job the best it could, dangles out of me lifelessly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOops,\u201d he says, \u201cmy bad,\u201d and quickly grabs it.\n\nI smack my lips, and my pussy smacks her lips too, like, can you believe this shit?\n\nHe has the nerve to ask, \u201cDid you come?\u201d\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSir.

Sadly, one of the few true beacons of hope to push back against the oppressive regime that is the Trump administration is a 79-year-old trailblazer and pioneer, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), affectionately known as \u201cAuntie Maxine.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom day one, Auntie Maxine has been adamant that she had no interest in working with an administration that wades deep in the waters of bigotry, racism and xenophobia.\n\n\u201cMy feet are firmly planted on the ground and dealing with the reality of things and what\u2019s happening and what\u2019s going on,\u201d she told The Root shortly after the president took office. \u201cIt has not been difficult; I just know that we are now going to have a new president. I don\u2019t care for him, I don\u2019t trust him and I know what I\u2019ve got to do.\u201d\n\nAuntie Maxine has been true to her word, whether it\u2019s been on the House Financial Services Committee, where she challenged Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to actually answer her questions\u2014it was this moment that spawned the heartfelt viral Auntie Maxine \u201creclaiming my time\u201d meme\u2014or speaking out against the atrocities of this administration whenever a microphone is in front of her. She has been adamant about Trump\u2019s impeachment and has constantly referred to the president as a con man.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows who this bully is,\u201d Waters told MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes on Monday, the Daily Beast reports. \u201cThis is a dishonorable human. He is a con man. He came to this job as a con man. I call him \u2018Don the Con Man.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe added: \u201cAll I know is this: If he thinks he can stop me from talking about \u2018Impeach 45,\u2019 he\u2019s got another thought coming. I am not intimidated by him. I\u2019m going to keep saying that we need to impeach him.\u201d\n\nSo Donald Trump\u2019s latest racist dog whistle to challenge Auntie Maxine\u2019s IQ falls on deaf ears because she was hip to who this president was long before he took office.\n\nIt\u2019s sad when America\u2019s aunt is probably America\u2019s toughest person and our biggest ally in the fight against blatant bigotry and racism. The president is currently running around the White House buck naked, and not one Democrat is willing to say he\u2019s not wearing any clothes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough it\u2019s heartwarming to see Waters so strong and willing to stand in her convictions against a divisive president who runs his administration like a schoolyard bully with unlimited Wi-Fi, it also saddens me that there aren\u2019t more Democrats willing to stand beside Auntie Maxine and call for Trump\u2019s ouster.\n\nAs it stands, those on the \u201cImpeach 45\u201d bandwagon are outliers for a more Rodney King, \u201cLet\u2019s all just get along\u201d Democratic vision, which is the equivalent of thinking that the schoolyard bully will understand anything but violence. At some point we\u2019ve got to move beyond reasoning. Auntie Maxine knew that from the beginning, and therefore had no intention of trying to work with this man or this administration.\n\nThey say that with age comes wisdom, and that\u2019s the advantage that Maxine Waters has over her fellow Democrats. She\u2019s faced down bullies before and knows from experience that sometimes you have to be willing to put your book bag down and stand up for yourself.

This is going to be fun for me, and I hope it is fun and enjoyable for you as well. Here we go.\n\nI don\u2019t know how or why I went my whole adult life without ever getting waxed down below, but here we are. To be fair, I was never \u201cTeen Wolf\u201d down there or anything, and I mostly handled it in the shower with a razor\u2014but you can only do so much with a razor, as we all know. There are parts of a lady\u2019s special place that you wouldn\u2019t want to put a razor near or risk getting cut. For those places, there is waxing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nI will admit that I was hesitant for a long while because all I could think about was how painful it must be. I asked all my friends who I know either wax or sugar their lady bits about the process, and most of them told me that yes, it does, in fact, hurt, but it\u2019s well worth it in the end. It took a while for me to be convinced.\n\n\n\nThe turning point for me came in September when a picture of a young lady\u2019s freshly waxed and perfectly greased-up love box floated down the Twitter timeline. I couldn\u2019t stop staring. It was fucking beautiful. I wanted that beauty for myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI made a decision. Fuck it, I thought. I\u2019m doing this.\n\nI asked my women friends in Los Angeles if they knew of a good spot I could go to that was clean and reputable. My girl Genoa referred me to a place in downtown L.A. called Wax Candy. She said she had been there before and had good experiences. I trusted her judgment, so I looked up their website.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir service menu included tips for what to do before and after getting waxed, as well as a diagram showing which parts each type of wax covered. I decided to go with the Brazilian, because if you gonna do it, do it right. Right?\n\nI called on a Friday afternoon and made an appointment for the next morning. That entire night, I stressed myself out thinking about it. Was it going to hurt? How long would it hurt? Was I going to like the outcome? Were my man friends going to like the outcome? Why did I say I was going to do this?\n\nI asked again on the Twitter timeline for tips. People gave me all kinds of helpful advice. Exfoliate before going. Take Advil or Aleve 30 minutes to an hour before the service. Wear loose clothing so as not to irritate it afterward. Moisturize beforehand so it\u2019s easier for the hair to come out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nWhen Saturday morning came around, I got out of bed and began the process of talking myself out of going. I called my best friend for moral support. I wanted her to tell me it was OK to chicken out. She was having none of that.\n\n\n\n\u201cBitch,\u201d she said matter-of-factly. \u201cYou can\u2019t walk around with your pussy looking like your mama\u2019s. Go get the damn wax.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat did it. I got in the shower and took extra care cleaning, because the last thing I wanted was for someone to be nose-deep in my love spot and be like, \u201cDamn, bitch. Did you at least rinse it off?\u201d\n\nBefore putting on my clothes, I slathered as much body butter as I thought I could get away with on the outer surfaces. I wanted to leave no room for error. Right before leaving the house, I popped two Aleve and prayed for the best.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDowntown L.A. is a nightmare when it comes to parking, so instead of driving, I took an Uber. The driver pulled up in front of Wax Candy, and I took a deep breath before getting out of the car. He probably thought that I was going through something, and he was right; I was. I still wasn\u2019t convinced I was going to be OK, but it was too late to back out. We here now.\n\n\n\nI walked inside and a friendly receptionist greeted me. I signed in on the guest list, and because it was my first time, I may have signed some other paper, but I don\u2019t remember now because everything at that point was a blur.\n\nThe receptionist introduced me to my waxer, Allie. Allie was a cheerful, friendly brown girl on the right side of plus-size, and I was immediately set at ease.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe led me to the waxing room and instructed me to take off my pants and underwear. I decided at the last moment to do my underarms as well, so she told me to go ahead and get completely naked. She offered me a paper gown in case I was too modest to let her see me naked.\n\nI did as instructed and lay on the table waiting for her to return. When she did, she told me she was going to start with my underarms.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIs it going to hurt?\u201d I asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt depends,\u201d she answered honestly. \u201cIt can. I\u2019ll do one strip and see how you feel.\u201d\n\nShe did one strip under my left arm and it was so quick, I felt nothing. I was amazed. She quickly waxed under both underarms, and I felt like a champion because nothing made me wince or cry. I hoped the waxing of my pudenda would go just as smoothly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Brazilian wax involves removing all the hair from the front, sides and labia as well as your inner \u201ctushy.\u201d\n\nShe started at the top, just under my FUPA. I ain\u2019t gonna lie, those first few strips hurt, but it was a quick hurt. The pain lasted only as long as it took her to remove the strip from my skin. She pressed down on each place she waxed, and that seemed to reduce the pain and the length of time it lingered by a great deal.\n\nFrom my FUPA, she moved to the top of my vulva, then the sides, and finally inside the labia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe entire time, she kept me distracted with good conversation and laughter.\n\nI know, it\u2019s hard to imagine engaging in laughter while someone is waxing your lady bits, but we really were having a good conversation and laughing all the way through it as she serviced me.\n\nThe service involves putting your legs in the butterfly position and at times lifting one leg or the other to provide the waxer access. I got through all the positions just fine, and again, most of it was relatively painless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nWe finally reached the part of the service where she had to wax the inside of my butt crack.\n\n\n\n\u201cOK,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I need you to do is lift your legs and pull your knees as close to your chest as possible.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMe, knowing all my years of being a ho were finally about to pay off:\n\nGIF\n\nI pulled my legs all the way back and let my feet touch the wall behind my head.\n\n\n\nShe was like, \u201cOK, girl. I didn\u2019t mean all of that.\u201d\n\nI relaxed, and she finished that part of the wax. We were done.\n\nShe got a mirror and handed it to me so I could inspect. As I did, she went over me with a pair of tweezers to make sure she hadn\u2019t missed anything, not much unlike what your eyebrow waxer does. Because she was so thorough, there wasn\u2019t a lot for her to grab with tweezers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I tell you I fell in love with my pussy all over again ... bitch, I feel in love with my pussy all over again. She was so pretty. And smooth! Touching the top of my mound felt like heaven.\n\nI spent the next week finding reasons to touch it when I was alone. I started doing it so much, I had to consciously remind myself not to reach down there in public. I\u2019m not exaggerating. It was so damn soft. Amazingly smooth to the touch.\n\n\n\nI vowed that I would get waxed forever and ever after that. And here comes the downside to it: In order to get waxed, the hair has to have grown to about the size of a fake eyelash. If you can lift it up with your fingers, there\u2019s enough hair to be waxed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor me, it took about six weeks to grow back to that point. It took another two before I was able to secure another appointment with Allie.\n\nI saw her again on Saturday. This time I felt like a pro, and I was ready. She didn\u2019t have to ease me into it. And because I had already been waxed before, the second process went even quicker than the first. We were done in about 10 minutes.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen she was done, I made a request that I thought she might balk at, but she took it all in stride.\n\n\n\nI asked her to oil my girl up and take pictures of her using my phone.\n\nY\u2019all, Allie turned into a damn photographer shooting a model. She caught my girl from so many angles, and all the pictures looked beautiful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have been using them to thirst-trap my male friends ever since.\n\nI cannot recommend getting waxed highly enough.\n\nI got my first-ever Brazilian, y\u2019all, and it literally changed my life.", "keywords": ["wanted", "took", "thought", "wax", "waxed", "going", "service", "girl", "life", "changed", "hurt", "1stever", "brazilian", "getting"], "polarity": 0.20488144078144077, "subjectivity": 0.48138717948717963},

Black women showed up and showed out in various ways. Black men put their careers and livelihoods on the line to speak out against racial injustice, police violence, and sexual assault and harassment. Creative artists experienced amazing glow ups, and black teenagers all over the country showed that no matter what, still we rise. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the biggest winners of 2017.\n\nBlack Activism\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a year that began with us getting the worst president in the world, black activists continued to do the work to help black people stay alive and get free. That activism took on many forms\u2014from protests both loud and silent to creative arts projects to writing\u2014and it was prolific in the year 2017.\n\nBlack people fought and continued to fight for clean water for the people of Flint, Mich., as well as other cities; social justice; economic justice; and an end to the state-sanctioned murder of black people at the hands of police. These fights are not over, and if 2017 was any indication, our voices will only get louder in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyonc\u00e9\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 broke the internet in February when she announced that she was pregnant with twins via an Instagram post, and her year went on an upswing that has not ended. Although we know she has plenty of haters, it\u2019s hard to understand how you can hate on someone so graceful, so beautiful, so talented and so free in her own black womanhood. Her pregnancy led to the birth of beautiful twins\u2014 which she has blessed us with time and time again. Oh, and Sir and Rumi were cute, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer charity and generosity are not always made public, but she gives from the heart when it matters most. Not to mention, her after-pregnancy snapback was real and an inspiration to us all. Deep down inside, she is just a \u201cTexas bama\u201d who has her fangirl moments just like the rest of us, and we are here for it. Long live Queen Bey.\n\nFenty Beauty\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all have our own favorite makeup brands, but when Rihanna announced that she would be launching Fenty Beauty in September, black girls (and the rest of y\u2019all) went crazy. No, she didn\u2019t make it just for us, but she made it for us in that she kept black girls in mind when creating the color ranges. The products flew off the shelves faster than they could be stocked.\n\nFenty had other beauty lines shook time and time again because Fenty had the range. Just one month in, Fenty had $72 million in earned media value, showing us that the combination of Black Girl Magic and black-girl social media capital is a guaranteed win. Right on, Fenty. Right on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack High School Seniors Accepted to College\n\nDespite being told by America every single day that their lives don\u2019t matter, black students continued to push forward and show that yes, the hell they do. Even as people tried to call them underachievers and say they are destined to a life of nothingness, black kids stood up and loudly proclaimed, \u201cYes, we can!\u201d Whether they were getting accepted to all eight Ivy League schools, heading off to Harvard or fulfilling their dream of going to their favorite HBCU, black high school seniors did the damn thing in 2017, and we are proud of y\u2019all. Keep pushing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardi B\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe don\u2019t dance no more, she makes money moves. If you look up the phrase \u201cglow up\u201d in the dictionary, right after the definition of the new vertical on The Root, there will be a picture of Cardi B, her tongue hanging out and the look of win on her face, because she seriously glowed up in 2017. Regardless of how you may feel about her, your hate and a Grammy snub won\u2019t stop her shine. She signed big deals, had one of the biggest hits of the year (my current theme song/anthem), got big props from the Queen herself\u2014and despite rumors of a potential breakup, her boo Offset proposed to her with an 8-carat diamond ring. Cardi did 2017 big as hell, and we can only expect that will continue in 2018.\n\nTerry Crews\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt takes a black man who is strong in will and mind to display restraint and not beat the shit out of a perverted white man who gropes his genitals in full view of everyone at a Hollywood party. It takes an even stronger black man to come forward during the #MeToo storm and admit that he, too, was sexually violated by a powerful white man in Hollywood. That strong black man was Terry Crews.\n\nWhile some questioned why he didn\u2019t just pummel Adam Venit when the Hollywood power broker allegedly grabbed his genitals at a party, Crews showed that it\u2019s a game of chess, not checkers, and in the end, the sound mind wins. He filed a police report, filed a lawsuit and spoke out against sexual assault in Hollywood, letting everyone know that he would not be a victim. He was named one of Time magazine\u2019s \u201csilence breakers.\u201d He dropped WME\u2014the agency Venit worked for that basically did nothing to protect Crews and everything to protect Venit\u2014and moved on to new representation, all without being the stereotypical angry black man that everyone wanted or expected him to be.\n\nThat is the very definition of winning. Kudos, Terry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarack Obama\n\nBarack Obama won 2017 the day he left office as the president of the United States. I am very sure it was like when Scarface quit his job in Half Baked.\n\nOur president started wearing less and going out more. He sent his wife a cute Valentine\u2019s Day tweet. He got crowds and applause just for being a regular-ass dude. People wanted so much more of him, the bidding war over his memoirs reached $60 million. He received the 2017 JFK Profile in Courage Award. He even reported for jury duty in Chicago. He basically showed everyone that leaving the presidency hasn\u2019t stopped his shine or his charisma, and your orange-colored Oompa Loompa of a president could never. Come through, Barack. Come through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColin Kaepernick\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNFL ratings are down, and league officials don\u2019t know what to do about it. Good. The NFL deserves whatever \u201cL\u2019s\u201d it gets because the NFL turned its back on Colin Kaepernick. Meanwhile, Kaepernick continues to shine. When he started his silent protests during the national anthem last year, he was widely criticized by people who didn\u2019t understand his need and desire to fight for black lives or the recognition he got for it. None of that matters. Despite it all, Kaepernick is living his best life. He has gotten award after award, and he is even considering buying an NFL team. Take that, NFL. Long live Colin Kaepernick.\n\nBlack Women\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2017 was the year of the black woman. From your Auntie Maxine Waters to Serena Williams winning the Australian Open while pregnant to Karen Bass\u2019 hilarious takedown of Jeff Sessions to black women showing up to guarantee Roy Moore did not win in Alabama to Tarana Burke and the #MeToo movement, black women were here for you. Black women have always been here for you. Black women will continue to be here for you. Now black women need you to be here for us.

I hate to see her go, but I\u2019ll love watching her perform!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, Jazz in the Gardens is one big celebration of blackness in all its forms of artistic expression.

Maxine Waters: Breaker of Chains, Reclaimer of Time\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter having to suffer the devastating dishonor of having an orange buffoon in the White House, black people have pretty much been fed up since before 2017. And no person illustrated this \u201cfed-uppedness\u201d more than longtime career politician Rep. Maxine Waters.\n\n\n\nMadame Waters (D-Calif.) was, quite frankly, the mood of 2017. From her hilarious and biting tweets to her determination to see Donald Trump impeached, she simply had no fucks to give. And the greatest example of this was when her legitimate question about 45\u2019s financial ties to Russia was interrupted by wayward Caucasian American Steven Mnuchin. The deflection did not deter her and she instead repeated \u201cReclaiming my time\u201d over and over again until he eventually shut the fuck up.\n\nShe\u2019s a boss. You know it. I know it. And 2017 knew it.\n\n2. Michelle Obama and the Side Eye Seen\u2019t Around the World\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch despair was felt through the force when it was announced that Agent Orange was gonna waltz his baked-Cheeto, dusty ass into the White House. And while that was bad enough, most of us couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how little time we had left to spend with the Obamas. So imagine our surprise when Michelle Obama gifted us with enough side eye during Inauguration Day to help us power through the rest of 2017.\n\nYes, before she would walk into the sunset with her beloved Barack and say goodbye to us forever, our good sis Michelle gave the best side eye ever after getting a gift from Melania and listening to all the Inauguration Day malarkey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was her final act as first lady. And what an act it was.\n\n3. Anika Noni Rose Lovingly Encouraging Cicely Tyson at the Emmys\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have a love-hate relationship with the Emmys, mostly based on how Caucasian the nomination lineups are for the night. However, I luckily caught a few moments from the 2017 Emmys. And I\u2019m glad I did because had I not, I would have missed one of the greatest moments in Black Girl Magic history.\n\n\n\nThe moment includes both Anika Noni Rose and Cicely Tyson going up to announce the winner for Outstanding Limited Series. The immortal Tyson paused right before recalling her role in Roots, and instead of awkwardly standing there until Tyson remembered, Rose leaned over and whispered an encouragement in Tyson\u2019s ears.\n\n\n\nIt was one of the simplest yet greatest acts of black sisterhood and solidarity that I had seen in a while. And in a year that was as brutal as 2017, it was sorely needed.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. World Stop: Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Pregnancy Announcement\n\nGreatness begets greatness. I don\u2019t know who said that, and I don\u2019t care to ask, but just know that it has been and always will be applied to Her Majesty King Beyonc\u00e9, First and Only of Her Name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter having a fantastic year in 2016, Beyonc\u00e9 blew our black minds when she surprise-announced her pregnancy on Instagram with the radiance and grace of a black Madonna. And while gracing us with her otherworldliness, she managed to piss off white women and white conservatives and inspire low-budget Great Value copycats in one wild swoop.\n\nNever change, Bey. Never change.\n\n5. Black Twitter Gathering Kendall Jenner\u2019s Edges Over That Pepsi Commercial\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlenty of black folx had a fantastic year. Cardi B had a fantastic year. Issa Rae had a phenomenal year. Rihanna had a spectacular year. New Edition had an amazing year. And Tiffany Haddish had an astounding year.\n\n\n\nThe list of black people laughing in the face of 2017 is very long. But such a list would be incomplete without the collective that is Black Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Twitter has been a respected entity for a while now. But it truly cemented itself as a cultural force for change when it single-handedly got Kendall Jenner\u2019s tone-deaf-ass Pepsi commercial yoinked from the TV airwaves. Indeed, Jenner thought she was doing all of us a favor by throwing some dusty Party City wig at a fellow sista in the commercial (an apt self-dragging of white feminism) before hijacking black and brown traditions of protest, and Black Twitter, of course, said, \u201cNot today, Satan.\u201d\n\n\n\nCombine this with other cultural moments like spurring on (along with Black Tumblr) Netflix to make that Rihanna-Lupita Nyong\u2019o Heist movie, penned by Issa Rae and directed by Ava DuVernay, a reality and exposing the hell out of Keaton Jones\u2019 white supremacist family, and it is very clear that Black Twitter is here to stay and suffers no fools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Black Women in Alabama Telling Roy Moore, \u201cYou Thought!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou probably notice how I keep mentioning that 2017 was a tough-ass year. This is most certainly true, especially politically.\n\nSince the Over-Inflated Tangerine was voted into office by white women, it\u2019s been a yearlong battle to make sure that our legislators, quite frankly, do not kill us. This has been true concerning the Affordable Care Act, the GOP tax plan, net neutrality and so much more. So you can say, politically, we really needed a win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd black women gave us exactly that in the election battle between Roy Moore and Doug Jones for a U.S. Senate seat representing Alabama.\n\nThe choice was between an accused child-molesting, homophobic bigot and a Democrat, Doug Jones, and white people almost purposely screwed the pooch again by voting in the alleged child molester because he was \u201ccloser to God\u201d (cue an eye roll). Of course, black women did not allow this to pass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a nod to the 94 percent who showed us they had common sense during the general election, and it proved that, yes, even states like Alabama (where black people live, too, Bernie Sanders) can have competitive elections if given the fucking chance.\n\nBlack women, I salute you. Truly.\n\n7. It Ain\u2019t Over Till It\u2019s Over: Moonlight\n\nIn that same vein, 2017 must have been the year of \u201cHold up, wait a minute,\u201d because not only did black people pull off the upset in Alabama this year, but we managed to pull it off during Oscar season, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this year, La La Land was heavily projected to win the Oscar for Best Picture over Moonlight, and despite all the queer black people everywhere giving Goku our energy for a spirit bomb, it looked like La La Land would indeed win. And that much was confirmed when B(La)h B(La)h Land was crowned winner.\n\nThat is ... until it was un-crowned.\n\nIn one of the most confusing moments of 2017, La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz snatched the card from the dazed and confused presenter and clarified that it was Moonlight that had actually won Best Picture. I\u2019m always gonna wonder who I need to drag for low-key stealing Moonlight\u2019s moment, but this should be a lesson to us as a people that it is not over until we say it\u2019s over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Colin Kaepernick Has the Last Laugh\n\nColin Kaepernick\u2019s long, hard-fought battle to call out police brutality and systemic injustice started out in 2016 when he, a San Francisco 49ers quarterback at the time, sat down during the playing of the national anthem at a preseason game versus the Green Bay Packers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, the football player and activist has been the center of an intense, national debate on racial and social injustice, and because he continued to walk and talk the talk, the powers that be decided that Kaepernick would enter the year as an unsigned free agent, despite being more talented than plenty of other current quarterbacks (*stares at Jay Cutler*).\n\n\n\nAnd these racist NFL owners probably had a good chuckle over it all ... until it was announced that Kaepernick was suing the shit out of all of them, of course.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only did Kaepernick decide to bring a case against them, but he also went on to become GQ\u2019s Citizen of the Year, and he\u2019s currently mulling over the prospect of maybe owning the Carolina Panthers alongside Diddy and Steph Curry.\n\nClearly, Kaepernick is just getting started.\n\n9. Black People Do Do Horror: On Get Out Being a Success\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn times of trial and tribulation, black art has risen like a phoenix and thrived in the face of uncertainty, and Get Out was certainly not an exception this year.\n\n\n\nJordan Peele\u2019s directorial debut and smash hit changed the game forever this year.\n\nNot only did it make bank with a film budget that sounded like the movie-producing equivalent of $3, but its biting social commentary on racial relations in America presented in the horror genre reminded us of how multifaceted black people are and how it\u2019s about damn time that black creatives get to flex our muscles in genre movies (another great example of this is Dee Rees\u2019 Mudbound, which no doubt counts as a Western/period piece).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd not even the Golden Globes\u2019 outdated genre system can take this win away from us.\n\n10. LeBron James Calling Donald Trump by His Name: \u201cBum\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the year when white people continued to show their asses and black people made a conscious and collective decision to stop giving a singular fuck, no such person illustrated this big mood quite like LeBron R. James.\n\nJames, a three-time NBA champ, has proved time and time again that he doesn\u2019t concern himself with the opinions of sheep, but he took this attitude to the next level when the Expired Squash got in his Twitter feelings about Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors\u2019 declining his booty-ass invite to visit the White (Supremacist) House.\n\nTrump was about five more seconds from going full Mean Girls on Curry (which included uninviting them) when James became sick of the bullshit and fired off the tweet heard around the world:\n\nHe called 45 a \u201cbum.\u201d\n\nThe legendary tweet is still on James\u2019 Twitter page. To this day. And I am hoping that it continues to serve as a visible reminder that black people from all walks of life are never too busy to speak truth to power and call a spade a spade. All while having a good and necessary laugh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s that on that.", "keywords": ["la", "2017", "twitter", "land", "kaepernick", "tyson", "women", "black", "white", "won", "moments"], "polarity": 0.10843534659042689, "subjectivity": 0.4960628438703303},

That\u2019s how Miami Gardens, Fla., Mayor Oliver Gilbert started our interview.\n\n\n\nClearly, I was in for a treat, or at least one of the most entertaining conversations I\u2019ve ever had, because Miami Gardens\u2019 mayor is a character. But he\u2019s also all about making sure he represents his city.\n\nGilbert serves as the president of the Dade League of Cities, he\u2019s on the board of the National League of Cities, he\u2019s on the advisory board of the U.S. Conference of Mayors and he\u2019s the incoming president of the African-American Mayors Association.\n\nHe\u2019s proud to be the voice that represents the 113,000 people who live in his city. \u201cI\u2019m a kid who grew up there who has the privilege of being the mayor of his hometown,\u201d Gilbert said, referencing his loyalty to home.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany people know Miami proper, especially South Beach, but there\u2019s more to Miami than tanned skin and toned physiques. There\u2019s plenty of culture. In fact, the mayor wears yet another hat: He\u2019s the executive producer of Jazz in the Gardens, a premier event featuring shows from a few of your favorite artists: Anita Baker, Chaka Khan, Fantasia, Joe, Smokey Robinson and more.\n\n\n\nThis event marks 12 years of culture and art through many genres, including soul, jazz and R&B. It\u2019s no wonder that an event like this is held in a city like Miami Gardens. This city is the largest black city in Florida and one of the largest black cities in the country.\n\n\n\nMayor Gilbert\u2019s goal is to build places where people can live, work and play. In addition to the Jazz in the Gardens show, there are many other reasons why you should consider visiting one of the the blackest cities in the country.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root: What\u2019s the importance of being the mayor of a black-run city?\n\nOliver Gilbert: Hope built this city. Hope is undefeated. It\u2019s worth noting that we\u2019re not just exceptional as a black city, we\u2019re exceptional as any city. We\u2019ve doubled the number of people who are opening businesses in the city every year that I\u2019ve been mayor.\n\nThere are stereotypes and preconceived notions that you can\u2019t do it right. We\u2019ve increased our bond rating, increased our reserves. We dedicated $60 million to transforming public space so that kids can learn science, technology, engineering, mathematics, culinary arts, recording studios and television production.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEssentially, what government is is our agreement with each other that we\u2019re going to live in a certain place, in a certain way. What our laws and what our budget should reflect are what our values are. So our values are making it better for our kids, make creating a better place for them. Enlarging their imagination, empowering them to dream bigger dreams and go further.\n\nTR: What makes you a unique mayor?\n\nOG: I have the best city in the country because I know who we were, who we are and who we can be. People talk about police officers\u2014I\u2019m going to take young kids from this community and put them in police academy. I\u2019m going to show you what community policing looks like. They said it was impossible. Now we\u2019re on our fourth plan. So, look, when they say it can\u2019t be done, what I say is \u201cOK\u201d and I go to work. I believe that anything\u2019s possible. That\u2019s what history\u2019s shown me. Anything is possible if you\u2019re willing to work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Tell me more about Jazz in the Gardens.\n\nOG: It was literally a parking lot. We changed a parking lot into something extraordinary, but that\u2019s because we\u2019re dedicated to it. We show that same dedication to our kids and to our government services. We understand that the city is one thing, a community is something else. So, I\u2019m the mayor of a city, but I\u2019m helping to build a community.\n\nWe have a lot of entertainment, but what\u2019s going on on the stage is just a little bit of it. What\u2019s going on in that audience is people connecting; it\u2019s the creation of a feeling that you will remember that will bring you back to my hometown, Miami Gardens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: What can you say about people who perceive Miami in a negative way?\n\nOG: The bad headline isn\u2019t actually the story. You might have something violent that happened that\u2019s the headline, but the story are the kids that are winning chess championships, the coding classes that are going on, the overemphasis on arts, the kids from Moonlight. The story is the fact that last year, we had Flo-Rida and Rick Ross, who are both from Miami Gardens as No. 1-No. 2 in sales in the world. That\u2019s the story!\n\nTR: As a black public official, what are your words of encouragement to those who have no hope in light of this administration?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOG: I don\u2019t care about a president who is on Twitter. We survived more than that. I know what we have done, so I know what we can do. This is for that student and every other person who looks at the news and is pessimistic about our future. And inheritance of hope is an indelible part of the American evolution. Because without hope, independence remains a colony. Slaves remain in servitude. The franchise is never female. Civil rights are always criminal. Education is never public. And labor happens without reward, without hope. And the White House is forever a White House.\n\n\n\nThat hope still lives in us. It is not lost to hate or division or fear or [fearmongers]. It is forever the dawn. I believe that. That belief is not born from a naive belief in the internal, it rises from what history was and what we are. I\u2019m looking at what hope has done as an indicator of what hope can do. Hope has changed the world. So hope can change the world. Hope is forever. We should all remain vigilant.\n\n\n\nTR: And why should people come to Jazz in the Gardens?\n\nOG: We want to bring you to Miami Gardens. We\u2019re going to keep your attention with who we are. I believe in my residents. I believe in my city. I believe in this event. We just need a shot.

Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and must have creamed his pants when he realized that the muva of the resistance was on the very same plane as he.\n\nBeing the punk bitch that he is, Johnson waited for Waters to go to sleep and then sat next to her and snapped a selfie (he also got a shot of her working before that).\n\nHis caption on Facebook read:\n\nI am sitting next to a female congressman on a flight from DCA to LAX who just said that she hopes an accused sexual harassing congressman Ruben J. Kihuen sticks it out. She spoke with a Hispanic man who is seated to my left one row up. He said that Kihuen was going to go meet Harry Reid who still \u201cruns the show\u201d.

On the TLC Tip at 25 TLC touched down at the tail end of 1991 in a neon blaze, and it took a minute for people\u2019s eyes to \u2026 Read more Read\n\nLast week, TLC announced that they\u2019ll be headlining the \u201cI Love the 90\u2019s Tour: The Party Continues,\u201d which will feature Montell Jordan, Sugar Ray\u2019s Mark McGrath, Naughty by Nature and Biz Markie. Presently, I\u2019m wondering how a group that had one of the most infamous episodes of Behind the Music morphed into an edition of Unsung.\n\nIt\u2019s no disrespect to the other acts on the bill, but as good as an idea about a novelty tour themed around the 1990s is, it feels like an odd fit for a group that sold 75 million albums and has been touted as the biggest-selling girl group of all time behind the Spice Girls.\n\n\n\nIf you switched out TLC for 702, Kut Klose, Jade, Brownstone, Divine or En Vogue without Dawn Robinson and Maxine Jones, it would sound more reasonable. I like and still listen to many tracks from the aforementioned, but they\u2019re not TLC. They\u2019re not the group that owned much of the 1990s on their own accord and whose success spilled over into the early 2000s before the untimely death of their third member, Lisa \u201cLeft Eye\u201d Lopes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a press release about the upcoming tour, TLC\u2019s remaining members, T-Boz and Chilli, stated: \u201cWe\u2019re so excited to get back on the road this summer and give our fans some new TLC music along with our original hits. Being able to headline this tour with our friends and peers from the \u201990s is SO AMAZING!\u201d\n\nThe new music in question will come from their forthcoming album that the group used Kickstarter to raise funds to record. However, back in 2013, after releasing the trailer to their VH1 biopic, CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story, TLC announced that they had signed a deal with Epic Records\u2014a deal that would offer an album primarily handled by longtime producer Dallas Austin. It also promised new songs written by Lady Gaga and Ne-Yo, and would feature contributions from Drake and J. Cole. What we got instead was yet another greatest-hits album and rumors that the women were dropped over their portrayal of their former manager, Pebbles, in the film.\n\nWhere did the album go? As for the fan-funded project, the Kickstarter campaign for it was launched in January 2015. It exceeded its contribution goal and gained widespread coverage after contemporary artists like Katy Perry donated money and publicity to the effort. But that album was set to drop by the end of that year, and only now will fans get what was promised by summer.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat album, like the tour, comes across as a bit odd, given the group\u2019s stature at varying points at the peak of their career.\n\nI remember once going to the 1995 Budweiser Superfest to see TLC, Boyz II Men, Mary J. Blige and Montell Jordan perform. TLC ended up canceling their spot, so for some tourgoers, they\u2019ll finally get to enjoy same-night performances of \u201cRed Light Special\u201d and \u201cSomethin 4 Da Honeyz.\u201d Still, when you think about the other acts on that bill who didn\u2019t record a bop with Master P, you will see how, in comparison, they have managed to avoid going on tour with the dude from Sugar Ray.\n\n\n\nBoyz II Men are long past their peak, but they have consistently toured the world for years and now have a Las Vegas residency. Blige has been consistent for more than 25 years and enjoys a career that includes recording Christmas songs with Barbra Streisand that get played nonstop at Macy\u2019s during the holidays. Blige also still releases singles that get airplay\u2014singles that make her sound like Bryson Tiller\u2019s auntie who aims to show her how to do the style she helped create. But hey, MJB has always kept cultural relevancy in her back pocket.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven last year\u2019s Bad Boy Reunion Tour was presented as a much bigger deal.\n\n\n\nIn comparison, the anniversary of TLC\u2019s debut album sort of came and went, and now they\u2019re about to do a throwback-themed tour. Then again, it sort of makes sense because since the early 2000s, TLC have relied on a lot of gimmicks that have arguably soiled their legacy. Gimmicks like the 2005 UPN reality series R U the Girl, a show originally believed to be a contest that would allow the winner to join TLC full time but later proved to be nothing more than a contest whose winner provided guest vocals on a new single from T-Boz and Chilli.\n\nNeither T-Boz nor Chilli got to release full-fledged solo projects (not for lack of trying). On that, know that I will never forgive you people for not supporting T-Boz\u2019s single \u201cTouch Myself.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly enough, back in 2015, while talking about their Kickstarter album and touring with New Kids on the Block (also a peculiar pairing), T-Boz had this to say about the lack of legends today: \u201cThere used to be way more superstars back in the day than there are now. Now they\u2019re sprinkled here and there. Like Beyonc\u00e9 is doing well and Rihanna has great songs, but you don\u2019t hear about great superstars like how it used to be.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time these two have made questionable comments about either artist. In 2014, T-Boz and Chilli did an interview with an Australian TV station and said this of Rihanna: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to sell sex. We became the biggest girl selling group of all time with our clothes on and that says a lot. We could go around, too, with booby cakes out all day long.\u201d\n\nTLC talked about multiple topics and, to their credit, were progressive and forward-thinking in a lot of their earlier works. Even so, raggedy men with limp dicks and dudes in general who simply can\u2019t fuck remained a constant throughout their catalog. They also have plenty of sex-related material, like \u201cThis Is How It Works,\u201d one of their best songs. You can talk about sex, but Rihanna and other artists can\u2019t be topless every now and again?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as such, Rihanna was right when she posted a picture of TLC posing topless. Plus, this tweet: \u201cWhen there\u2019s no changing the fact that I\u2019m me, and they\u2019re well ... they\u2019re them.\u201d T-Boz would later deny talking about her.\n\n\n\nEven so, I recall Chilli taking to Twitter to ask people to not bring \u201cBey, \u2018B\u2019, queen B, or any variation ... of the word Beyonc\u00e9\u201d into 2014. It\u2019s not the first time that Chilli has publicly sniped about Beyonc\u00e9, but if there\u2019s one thing I wish for Rihanna and Beyonc\u00e9, it\u2019s that they never be as publicly petty toward those that come after them.\n\nTLC are legends, but when it comes to what\u2019s happened to the group\u2019s stature since the death of Left Eye, it reads as a long list of don\u2019ts for the large acts of today. Don\u2019t do a fake-replacement-member-themed reality show. Don\u2019t talk too crazy about Pebbles if her ex-husband is the plug. Don\u2019t trash the huge acts of today who are actually bigger than you\u2019ve ever been, good old days of diamond-selling albums or not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those who attend the tour, have the time of your life. TLC still performs well. Nonetheless, for quite some time now, TLC has moved in ways that make me feel like, \u201cDamn, homie. In high school you was the main, homie.\u201d May Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna never do an \u201cI Love the 2010s Tour\u201d with Meghan Trainor, two of the remaining members of Fifth Harmony and Jason Derulo.\n\n", "keywords": ["group", "tboz", "album", "tlc", "going", "rihanna", "songs", "ray", "beyonc\u00e9", "sugar", "dude", "chilli", "theyre", "tour"], "polarity": 0.13933534274655773, "subjectivity": 0.41548016884465494},

And that is the story of how The Root became a media sponsor for the 13th annual Jazz in the Gardens Music Festival.\n\nAs the fastest-growing jazz and R&B festival in the United States, JITG, in Miami Gardens, Fla., is the kind of ticket you want to get your hands on. Before I go on, think about this: Miami Gardens is one of the few black-run cities in the United States. So you know this festival is a big, black deal.\n\nAnd listen, JITG keeps getting better, because they have a special \u201cI Love the \u201990s\u201d tribute planned with Salt-N-Pepa, Kid \u2019n Play, Trick Daddy and Biz Markie!

Ooh, I\u2019m about to spend all my hard-earned money!\n\nAnita Baker is a known recluse. She\u2019s not alone on the list of artists who prefer the spotlight only when onstage. We\u2019ve seen her \u201cdon\u2019t look at me\u201d behavior in others like Marvin Gaye, Sade, Lauryn Hill, Jazmine Sullivan and Bilal. Maybe it\u2019s a thing that artists do to make us want them more? Hey, it works! I want to see Baker so bad, I am willing to go directly from a very exhausting vacation (I realize how first world I sound) right into working this show. I\u2019ll do that for Anita Baker. I love her the way Andr\u00e9 3000 does.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBaker has had the kind of career most R&B songstresses only dream of. She\u2019s been singing throughout four decades and boasts eight Grammys, four American Music Awards and seven Soul Train Music Awards. In 1994, Baker\u2019s Rhythm of Love album led a tour that basically slayed, and then she went \u201chome to recharge.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s when life happened for the singer. She said in an interview that she was caring for her children, husband and two ailing (now late) parents: \u201cI put my family over my career for the last 10 years, and I didn\u2019t intend to, but it just happened that way, and as it started to happen, it was like, this feels right.\u201d\n\nAin\u2019t nothing wrong with that, Ms. Baker! I\u2019m just glad she ultimately decided to hit us all with more performances. In January 2017, Baker announced on Twitter that she would be retiring by her 59th birthday later that year. But then, at the top of this year, she announced that she\u2019d be giving her loyal fans a farewell tour. And here we are. I hate to see her go, but I\u2019ll love watching her perform!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, Jazz in the Gardens is one big celebration of blackness in all its forms of artistic expression.

From helping to launch the careers of Sheila E., Vanity, Apollonia 6 and the Time to serving as an inspiration to generations of artists\u2014including the Weeknd, D\u2019Angelo, Frank Ocean, Beyonc\u00e9, Pharrell, etc., etc., etc.\u2014Prince left an indelible mark on music that will probably never be equaled (and by \u201cprobably\u201d I mean \u201cdefinitely,\u201d which, again, if you disagree, be prepared to catch these hands).\n\nBecause his genius was so far-reaching, here are eight songs you probably didn\u2019t know were influenced, written by or just blessed by Prince\u2019s mere presence.\n\n\n\n1. \u201cStand Back,\u201d Stevie Nicks\n\nThe way Stevie Nicks tells it, she began writing \u201cStand Back\u201d after hearing \u201cLittle Red Corvette\u201d while on her honeymoon. She spent most of the night penning the song while humming the greatest single ever about a one-night stand. Later, Nicks called Prince because she wanted to confess to him that she had \u201ckinda ripped off his song.\u201d Prince being Prince, he showed up at her place, sprinkled his purple magic all over her synthesizers for about 25 minutes and then left.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe spoiled me for every band I\u2019ve ever had because nobody can exactly re-create\u2014not even with two piano players\u2014what Prince did all by his little self,\u201d Nicks told music journalist Timothy White in 1991. Prince\u2019s contribution is uncredited, but the two superstars did agree to split the royalties 50-50, because even musical geniuses can\u2019t live off of high praise and thank-you notes.\n\n\n\n2. \u201cLike a Prayer,\u201d Madonna\n\nLike a Prayer, the album, actually features a duet between the Queen of Pop and the Purple One called \u201cLove Song.\u201d But Prince also laid down some guitar tracks while in the studio. According to Madonna producer Patrick Leonard, the guitar distortions heard at the beginning of an extended version of \u201cLike a Prayer\u201d were played by Prince. That version isn\u2019t heard on the album, but it can be heard in the controversial video that got Pepsi in a lot of trouble, and which shows that the soda giant has been making bad choices involving privileged white women for quite some time now.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \u201cYou\u2019re My Love,\u201d Kenny Rogers\n\nPrince wrote songs for many artists across all genres, and since country music is black music\u2014despite what fans of the Country Music Awards might think\u2014it isn\u2019t too surprising that he wrote a track for country superstar Kenny Rogers. Using the pen name \u201cJoey Coco,\u201d Prince wrote the 1986 ballad after Rogers contacted him through a mutual friend about getting Prince to write him a song.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cManic Monday,\u201d the Bangles\n\nPrince did love him some pen names, and this hit single was credited to \u201cChristopher,\u201d as in Christopher Tracy, his character from Under a Cherry Moon. The track was initially intended for Apollonia 6, but Prince sent the song to the Bangles, reportedly because he had a thing for Bangles guitarist-vocalist Susanna Hoffs. It would become the band\u2019s first big hit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. \u201cSugar Walls,\u201d Sheena Easton\n\nBefore Prince got ahold of her, Sheena Easton was singing sugary pop tunes about morning trains and being a modern girl. After Prince, she was singing a different tune \u2014specifically, the sexually suggestive \u201cSugar Walls,\u201d which ended up being listed on the \u201cFilthy 15\u201d\u2014the songs with the raunchiest, most violent or drug-fueled lyrics, according to Tipper Gore\u2019s Parents Music Resource Center, the force behind the \u201cparental advisory\u201d sticker. The Filthy 15 also featured another sexually explicit song by Prince that drove Gore to create the PMRC in the first place. Easton would later join Prince on another track, \u201cU Got the Look,\u201d from 1987\u2019s Sign o\u2019 the Times.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. \u201cI Feel for You,\u201d Chaka Khan\n\nPrince wrote this classic R&B hit for Patrice Rushen, who rejected the track along with \u201cI Wanna Be Your Lover\u201d (I wonder how Rushen, who had a decent career, feels now about not jumping on the Prince bandwagon when she had the chance?), so he included the song on his 1979 self-titled album. In 1984, Chaka Khan released an album of the same name and, in a rare feat, produced a song that outshone the origin. Of course, Chaka did have a little help from legendary rapper Melle Mel, who dropped that catchy little verse on the opening of the track, which perfectly took advantage of the growing rise of hip-hop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. \u201cHow Come You Don\u2019t Call Me,\u201d Alicia Keys\n\nHere again is another example of a female singer taking a Prince tune and turning it into a hit (of course, the most famous example of this is Sinead O\u2019Connor\u2019s cover of \u201cNothing Compares 2 U\u201d). Based on Prince\u2019s \u201cHow Come U Don\u2019t Call Me Anymore?,\u201d which first appeared on a compilation album in 1993, Key\u2019s single appeared on her debut album, Songs in A Minor, in 2001.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. \u201cWhen You Were Mine,\u201d Cyndi Lauper\n\nThis Prince-penned song appeared on Lauper\u2019s debut album, 1983\u2019s She So Unusual. Lauper, who, like Prince, had a unique musical persona that confounded and defied expectations, was a longtime friend of the Royal One, who gave her business advice back in the day when they were stars coming up in the \u201980s; he even secretly attended her concerts.", "keywords": ["little", "touched", "stand", "princes", "probably", "magic", "album", "wrote", "know", "prince", "music", "didnt", "songs", "single", "track", "song"], "polarity": 0.09200669700669702, "subjectivity": 0.47079161579161594},

The crowd\u2014full of celebrities, influencers, fellow honorees, powerful women and spectators\u2014joined her call-and-response chant as she raised her arms in the air and encouraged them to get louder and louder. According to Newsweek, Glamour declared it one of the \u201cbiggest moments\u201d of the ceremony.\n\nAttendees posted videos of the moment to social media.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Waters has led a chant calling for the dotard in chief to be removed from office.

You might have something violent that happened that\u2019s the headline, but the story are the kids that are winning chess championships, the coding classes that are going on, the overemphasis on arts, the kids from Moonlight. The story is the fact that last year, we had Flo-Rida and Rick Ross, who are both from Miami Gardens as No. 1-No. 2 in sales in the world. That\u2019s the story!\n\nTR: As a black public official, what are your words of encouragement to those who have no hope in light of this administration?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOG: I don\u2019t care about a president who is on Twitter. We survived more than that. I know what we have done, so I know what we can do. This is for that student and every other person who looks at the news and is pessimistic about our future. And inheritance of hope is an indelible part of the American evolution. Because without hope, independence remains a colony. Slaves remain in servitude. The franchise is never female. Civil rights are always criminal. Education is never public. And labor happens without reward, without hope. And the White House is forever a White House.\n\n\n\nThat hope still lives in us. It is not lost to hate or division or fear or [fearmongers]. It is forever the dawn. I believe that. That belief is not born from a naive belief in the internal, it rises from what history was and what we are. I\u2019m looking at what hope has done as an indicator of what hope can do. Hope has changed the world. So hope can change the world. Hope is forever. We should all remain vigilant.\n\n\n\nTR: And why should people come to Jazz in the Gardens?\n\nOG: We want to bring you to Miami Gardens. We\u2019re going to keep your attention with who we are.

You graciously accept the invite! And that is the story of how The Root became a media sponsor for the 13th annual Jazz in the Gardens Music Festival.\n\nAs the fastest-growing jazz and R&B festival in the United States, JITG, in Miami Gardens, Fla., is the kind of ticket you want to get your hands on. Before I go on, think about this: Miami Gardens is one of the few black-run cities in the United States. So you know this festival is a big, black deal.\n\nAnd listen, JITG keeps getting better, because they have a special \u201cI Love the \u201990s\u201d tribute planned with Salt-N-Pepa, Kid \u2019n Play, Trick Daddy and Biz Markie! I can hear my childhood screaming in glee now!\n\nNot only am I about to be swaying in the Miami heat (ha, see what I did there?) to the sweet sounds of Baker\u2019s acrobatic alto notes, but there\u2019ll also be a delicious spread of American and Caribbean cuisines and a chance to buy black with offerings of artwork, handbags, clothing and memorabilia. Ooh, I\u2019m about to spend all my hard-earned money!\n\nAnita Baker is a known recluse. She\u2019s not alone on the list of artists who prefer the spotlight only when onstage. We\u2019ve seen her \u201cdon\u2019t look at me\u201d behavior in others like Marvin Gaye, Sade, Lauryn Hill, Jazmine Sullivan and Bilal. Maybe it\u2019s a thing that artists do to make us want them more? Hey, it works! I want to see Baker so bad, I am willing to go directly from a very exhausting vacation (I realize how first world I sound) right into working this show. I\u2019ll do that for Anita Baker. I love her the way Andr\u00e9 3000 does.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBaker has had the kind of career most R&B songstresses only dream of. She\u2019s been singing throughout four decades and boasts eight Grammys, four American Music Awards and seven Soul Train Music Awards. In 1994, Baker\u2019s Rhythm of Love album led a tour that basically slayed, and then she went \u201chome to recharge.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s when life happened for the singer. She said in an interview that she was caring for her children, husband and two ailing (now late) parents: \u201cI put my family over my career for the last 10 years, and I didn\u2019t intend to, but it just happened that way, and as it started to happen, it was like, this feels right.\u201d\n\nAin\u2019t nothing wrong with that, Ms. Baker! I\u2019m just glad she ultimately decided to hit us all with more performances. In January 2017, Baker announced on Twitter that she would be retiring by her 59th birthday later that year. But then, at the top of this year, she announced that she\u2019d be giving her loyal fans a farewell tour. And here we are. I hate to see her go, but I\u2019ll love watching her perform!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, Jazz in the Gardens is one big celebration of blackness in all its forms of artistic expression. I\u2019m beyond excited because I feel as if I am about to have a major spiritual moment in Miami Gardens.\n\nClick here for tickets.\n\n", "keywords": ["yall", "tour", "music", "weekend", "baker", "gardens", "jazz", "love", "miami", "seeing", "way", "im", "united", "anita"], "polarity": 0.17867365424430642, "subjectivity": 0.55527950310559},

That is how long I\u2019ve been sick with an unknown virus (the thing doctors tell you when they don\u2019t know what it is but know it won\u2019t kill you). It\u2019s not the flu. It\u2019s not a cold. But it is one thing\u2014a jerk. Just the biggest jerk of a disease ruining my social life by forcing me to be actually antisocial, much like the name of this column.\n\nAntisocial is the events-and-society column for people allergic to society, aka those with social anxiety disorder, so it\u2019s not as if I needed an actual disease to give me a reason to stay home. I come up with plenty of excuses to stay in the house\u2014it\u2019s too hot, it\u2019s too cold, it\u2019s too \u201coutside\u201d\u2014whatever works. But I had actually been looking forward to the spate of events I had lined up over the last two weeks to crash. Page Six TV\u2019s party. A YouTube-Elle Magazine function. So many Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Annual Legislative Conference panels and events in Washington, D.C. All missed because I was too busy hacking and coughing in my prison of used Kleenex.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is my first time being ill in more than two years, ruining my pristine streak of good health, all of which was fueled (mostly) by a flu shot I took back in 2015 and some really good luck, considering that New York City is a germophobe\u2019s nightmare fuel. I\u2019m supposed to travel back to D.C. later this week for my 40th birthday, but the way this sickness is going, who knows what will happen come Friday? Can I even travel? I could\u2019ve almost died in my hotel room during CBC week because I choked on a cold tablet that got lodged in my throat.\n\n\n\nIn the middle of my more than 18 days of sinus infection, I decided to take a break from being sick and pretended to be well because I didn\u2019t want to miss the Black & White Champagne Brunch with the New York Urban League at La Marina in New York City on Sept. 16.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout 200 people gathered for the brunch, which was hosted by actress and body-positive advocate RaVal Davis. Charter Communications Vice President of State Government Affairs Camile Joseph Goldman was being honored with the David N. Dinkins Award for Service, Leadership and Social Justice at the event, which also featured performances by NAACP Theater Award-winning actress and singer Sha\u2019Leah Nikole.\n\nShe performed Roberta Flack\u2019s classic by way of the Fugees, \u201cKilling Me Softly,\u201d as I ate eggs and bacon, feeling proud of my ability to actually throw together a halfway decent outfit that didn\u2019t make me feel that I unnecessarily stood out in a bad way, but still blended in with the overall theme of everyone in black and white.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRemarks were made by NYUL President and CEO Arva R. Rice and Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.), as well as Goldman, who gave a spirited and impassioned speech.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was mostly thankful that it wasn\u2019t a dreaded \u201cwhite party\u201d (black people love white parties, where you dress in all white, get turnt and look like drunken angels), because I hate wearing all white with a passion. The absence of color does nothing for my complexion and is almost as dreaded as wearing all black, which makes me look like I (still) work at Macy\u2019s.\n\n\n\nPer usual, I had no business cards on me because they were still in the mail at the time and my old cards were lost more than a year ago in my move to New York City. (They did show up in time for CBC week, meaning that a bunch of people now have my work number, filling me with a special kind of anxiety.)\n\nThis made me garner a look from New York society columnist Audrey J. Bernard, whom I\u2019d watched chastise a young woman who approached me a few weeks ago at a New York Fashion Week event wanting to write for The Root and had no business cards. To be honest, I find that when I receive business cards, I never do absolutely anything with them unless the person is someone I\u2019m desperately, constantly forgetting the name of. Then I hold on to the card as if I\u2019m hoping the name will be absorbed into my porous brain.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m notoriously bad with names. Chances are, if you know me and I know you but we\u2019re not close enough to be besties, I don\u2019t actually know your name even though I\u2019ve met you several times, seen you at multiple events and recognize you easily. I used to have a publisher, Virginia Moorhouse\u2014whose family owns the Bakersfield Californian newspaper, where I worked for five years\u2014who was fantastic at remembering everyone\u2019s name, an incredible, enviable skill.\n\nI try all the tricks, repeating the name back to them, introducing them to friends so they have to say their name\u2014nothing really works except for this one time when I ran into a guy (who also probably didn\u2019t know my name, either, to be honest) in the airport and I remembered his entire life story but not his name, so I went home and furiously Googled his job and searched for his name and picture until it popped up, then just kept walking around my apartment, repeating the name back to myself like a lunatic.\n\nWhich brings me to CBC in Washington, where I was talking to Very Smart Brothas\u2019 Panama Jackson, a senior editor here at The Root, and he was also complaining about how he knew no one\u2019s name. How he would know people, kick it with people at parties and still have no idea what they\u2019re called. He wondered if something was wrong with him or if he was just self-centered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI told him I was the same way and that he was likely just self-centered, since I\u2019m sure that is my issue. I\u2019m often too busy thinking about whatever the personal malady of the day is to know what anyone\u2019s name is, lost in my own head. I may be present with you in the moment, talking, smiling, laughing, but am I really there? Or am I lost in my own head, wondering about this and that? It\u2019s annoying and probably one of my least favorite things about myself. I want to be in the moment, but I\u2019m easily distracted by my own internal drama.\n\nEvery year for the past 47 years, the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation has thrown a conference in D.C. that attracts thousands of black people from across the nation to talk policy and community issues, then fight to get into many of the exclusive parties going on around the main event. I was too sick for most of the conference, barely making it through panels\u2014faring poorly with a panel The Root\u2019s Jason Johnson and Panama were on about the importance of the black press, but faring a bit better during a panel on the film Black Panther that featured director Ryan Coogler and an exclusive five-minute clip from the film.\n\nI spent most of the conference just trying not to die, but managed to pull it together for a discussion between St. Louis\u2019 own, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) (she\u2019s from Kinloch, Mo., to be precise), and BET\u2019s newest late-night talk show host, Robin Thede, soon to be starring in The Rundown With Robin Thede.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was excited to attend this event and to meet Robin because we have something in common: We were both black-lady head writers for late-night talk shows\u2014she is formerly of Larry Wilmore\u2019s show on Comedy Central, and I am formerly of BET\u2019s previous late-night outing Don\u2019t Sleep Hosted by T.J. Holmes.\n\nMy foray into late-night TV was very (very!) short-lived. The show lasted only four months back in 2012. T.J. has since moved on to Good Morning America on ABC, and I\u2019m obviously here at The Root, holding it down. I wished Robin all the best with her show (and told her I\u2019d love to do a feature on her for The Root), and judging by how well she handled her interview with Waters\u2014it was funny and insightful\u2014I have a feeling she might last much, much longer than our four months of ratings-based struggle! (But we did get this sweet write-up in the New York Times!)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for all the other activities that happened during CBC, I left all of those for everyone else to enjoy, since I spent nearly every night in my hotel room quietly wondering why I traveled to D.C. while sick on a germ-filled Amtrak train, resickening myself and making my illness worse. I left all the real partying to my friend Jason, who did all the things I would have done had I been well\u2014like be bold enough to crash parties I wasn\u2019t invited to in order to see T.I. and Babyface perform at separate galas. I ended up giving away my ticket to the coveted Black Party (hosted by La La Anthony and featuring Doug E. Fresh) to my best friend, Jada Prather, so I could go back to my hotel and die.\n\nSpeaking of dying, I almost did! The following morning, I attempted to take some cold medication and choked on the pill. It got caught up in my throat and would NOT dislodge despite all the coughing, hacking and vomiting I did. Fearing that I would die, I called the front desk and attempted to tell them, \u201cSend help, I\u2019m choking!\u201d For some reason, they misinterpreted this but did send up a gentleman who, upon looking at me hacking and coughing with mucus running from my nose, took off running in the other direction, shouting on his walkie-talkie to the front desk. I was hoping he\u2019d help me out with a Heimlich or something, but no.\n\nSo I was left gagging and contemplating whether this was the end. That the sum of my life would conclude with me asphyxiating on a very large DayQuil gel cap, in a T-shirt and underwear, in a hotel room in D.C. All I kept thinking was, \u201cThis is a stupid, stupid way to die.\u201d I also thought a lot about the HBO show Six Feet Under, which had an episode once in which a woman choked to death on food in her apartment, and how I always feared this happening to me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo I thought about dying, my father, Six Feet Under and how dumb this was. A dumb way to die. I couldn\u2019t die like this. I had to calm down and attempt to breath through all the coughing and heaving so I wouldn\u2019t black out.\n\nAfter what felt like forever, the pill started to break down and dissolve in my throat, probably from all the vomiting of stomach acid (it was very early in the morning and I hadn\u2019t eaten yet). The hotel sent several more people up to my room to check on me, including the paramedics, who had been told that someone \u201cfell.\u201d I was like, \u201cNah, I was choking.\u201d So the paramedics cracked a few jokes and left.\n\nAfter everyone determined that no one had died at the Hyatt Place in \u201cNoMa\u201d (lol at that name), I was left to my own devices, whereupon I sat in my room and cried until Jason called me and invited me to breakfast, where I recounted to him my brush with death in a hoarse voice that could barely get out words.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere, I ate this Breakfast Bandit bagel sandwich at Buffalo & Bergen in Union Market.\n\nIt was delicious, but I was still teary and miserable, and I wanted to document the first thing I attempted to eat after almost dying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeemed important.\n\nThankfully, I am not dead, but still on the mend from my illness. I have a whole spate of events lined up in October that I will hopefully be much more healthy and present for. Hopefully. Maybe. Perhaps. Ideally.\n\nBut for now, just trying not to die while taking this cold medication.", "keywords": ["leagues", "york", "sick", "room", "socialize", "know", "die", "urban", "foundations", "dc", "hotel", "black", "white", "way", "im", "went", "ny"], "polarity": 0.07901404598985247, "subjectivity": 0.45319120544926994},

There\u2019s plenty of culture. In fact, the mayor wears yet another hat: He\u2019s the executive producer of Jazz in the Gardens, a premier event featuring shows from a few of your favorite artists: Anita Baker, Chaka Khan, Fantasia, Joe, Smokey Robinson and more.\n\n\n\nThis event marks 12 years of culture and art through many genres, including soul, jazz and R&B. It\u2019s no wonder that an event like this is held in a city like Miami Gardens. This city is the largest black city in Florida and one of the largest black cities in the country.\n\n\n\nMayor Gilbert\u2019s goal is to build places where people can live, work and play. In addition to the Jazz in the Gardens show, there are many other reasons why you should consider visiting one of the the blackest cities in the country.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root: What\u2019s the importance of being the mayor of a black-run city?\n\nOliver Gilbert: Hope built this city. Hope is undefeated. It\u2019s worth noting that we\u2019re not just exceptional as a black city, we\u2019re exceptional as any city. We\u2019ve doubled the number of people who are opening businesses in the city every year that I\u2019ve been mayor.\n\nThere are stereotypes and preconceived notions that you can\u2019t do it right. We\u2019ve increased our bond rating, increased our reserves. We dedicated $60 million to transforming public space so that kids can learn science, technology, engineering, mathematics, culinary arts, recording studios and television production.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEssentially, what government is is our agreement with each other that we\u2019re going to live in a certain place, in a certain way. What our laws and what our budget should reflect are what our values are. So our values are making it better for our kids, make creating a better place for them. Enlarging their imagination, empowering them to dream bigger dreams and go further.\n\nTR: What makes you a unique mayor?\n\nOG: I have the best city in the country because I know who we were, who we are and who we can be. People talk about police officers\u2014I\u2019m going to take young kids from this community and put them in police academy. I\u2019m going to show you what community policing looks like. They said it was impossible. Now we\u2019re on our fourth plan. So, look, when they say it can\u2019t be done, what I say is \u201cOK\u201d and I go to work. I believe that anything\u2019s possible. That\u2019s what history\u2019s shown me. Anything is possible if you\u2019re willing to work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Tell me more about Jazz in the Gardens.\n\nOG: It was literally a parking lot. We changed a parking lot into something extraordinary, but that\u2019s because we\u2019re dedicated to it. We show that same dedication to our kids and to our government services.

You graciously accept the invite! And that is the story of how The Root became a media sponsor for the 13th annual Jazz in the Gardens Music Festival.\n\nAs the fastest-growing jazz and R&B festival in the United States, JITG, in Miami Gardens, Fla., is the kind of ticket you want to get your hands on. Before I go on, think about this: Miami Gardens is one of the few black-run cities in the United States. So you know this festival is a big, black deal.\n\nAnd listen, JITG keeps getting better, because they have a special \u201cI Love the \u201990s\u201d tribute planned with Salt-N-Pepa, Kid \u2019n Play, Trick Daddy and Biz Markie! I can hear my childhood screaming in glee now!\n\nNot only am I about to be swaying in the Miami heat (ha, see what I did there?) to the sweet sounds of Baker\u2019s acrobatic alto notes, but there\u2019ll also be a delicious spread of American and Caribbean cuisines and a chance to buy black with offerings of artwork, handbags, clothing and memorabilia. Ooh, I\u2019m about to spend all my hard-earned money!\n\nAnita Baker is a known recluse. She\u2019s not alone on the list of artists who prefer the spotlight only when onstage. We\u2019ve seen her \u201cdon\u2019t look at me\u201d behavior in others like Marvin Gaye, Sade, Lauryn Hill, Jazmine Sullivan and Bilal. Maybe it\u2019s a thing that artists do to make us want them more? Hey, it works! I want to see Baker so bad, I am willing to go directly from a very exhausting vacation (I realize how first world I sound) right into working this show. I\u2019ll do that for Anita Baker. I love her the way Andr\u00e9 3000 does.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBaker has had the kind of career most R&B songstresses only dream of. She\u2019s been singing throughout four decades and boasts eight Grammys, four American Music Awards and seven Soul Train Music Awards. In 1994, Baker\u2019s Rhythm of Love album led a tour that basically slayed, and then she went \u201chome to recharge.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s when life happened for the singer. She said in an interview that she was caring for her children, husband and two ailing (now late) parents: \u201cI put my family over my career for the last 10 years, and I didn\u2019t intend to, but it just happened that way, and as it started to happen, it was like, this feels right.\u201d\n\nAin\u2019t nothing wrong with that, Ms. Baker! I\u2019m just glad she ultimately decided to hit us all with more performances. In January 2017, Baker announced on Twitter that she would be retiring by her 59th birthday later that year. But then, at the top of this year, she announced that she\u2019d be giving her loyal fans a farewell tour. And here we are. I hate to see her go, but I\u2019ll love watching her perform!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, Jazz in the Gardens is one big celebration of blackness in all its forms of artistic expression. I\u2019m beyond excited because I feel as if I am about to have a major spiritual moment in Miami Gardens.\n\nClick here for tickets.\n\n", "keywords": ["yall", "tour", "music", "weekend", "baker", "gardens", "jazz", "love", "miami", "seeing", "way", "im", "united", "anita"], "polarity": 0.17867365424430642, "subjectivity": 0.55527950310559},

She pretty much disappeared from public view to raise her family.\n\nSoul Tracks chronicles her career and notes her importance, saying that \u201calong with Luther Vandross, she virtually created Urban Adult Contemporary as a viable radio format in the \u201980s, and countless subsequent singers owe a huge debt to Baker for demonstrating that a mature soul audience would buy music and for creating a pathway for artists to reach that audience.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 1, Baker tweeted some solace to those of us who miss her so: \u201cSo much 2 celebrate with you in #2018,\u201d she began. \u201c60th Bday in 25 days \u2026 Farewell Concert Series beginning in March \u2026 We\u2019ll paint pictures together 2 last a lifetime \u2026 \u201cLet\u2019s party!\u201d #OneLastTime abxo damn \u2026 Where does the time go?!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnita Baker is 60?!\n\n\n\nBut moreover, we can see her live again?

As a councilwoman from the Mar\u00e9 favela, she denounced the police brutality that favela residents, most of them black, regularly experienced.\n\nOn Wednesday around 9:20 p.m., armed men gunned the councilwoman down in her car in the center of Rio de Janeiro with nine shots\u2014four to the head. Her driver, Anderson Pedro Gomes, also died. She had just left an event that she organized about black women\u2019s empowerment.\n\n\n\nHer death touched so many people that supporters organized vigils and protests in more than 20 cities across Brazil. Most of these protests were against the genocide of black people in Brazil. For Afro-Brazilians, Franco proved that a black person from a favela could be educated, have dignity and also fight against the social injustice that black Brazilians suffer from every day. For women, she proved that they could overcome sexism and machismo in Brazil. But her death is hitting Afro-Brazilian women, who suffer the most from Brazil\u2019s violent, racist and sexist society, the hardest.\n\n\u201cShe died because she was a combative black woman,\u201d said Lua Nascimento, an Afro-Brazilian college classmate of Franco\u2019s who attended a protest on her behalf in Salvador, Brazil. \u201cShe was executed because she was a black favela dweller who fought against the murder of black favela dwellers. The genocide of the black population continues in this country.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThousands of people gathered in front of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s council chambers to pay homage to Franco, who was buried Thursday night. To show their digital support for her, Brazilians are changing their Facebook profile photos to those of Franco and using the hashtag #MariellePresente, which translates to \u201cMarielle is here.\u201d\n\nAmnesty International, the longtime leader of a campaign against the genocide of black people in Brazil, demanded that her death be rigorously investigated. With those nine shots, Franco became one more statistic in this genocide. Just over 50 percent of Brazil\u2019s population of 200 million is black. But blacks account for 2 out of every 3 murders. They are also overrepresented in favelas where violence and murder of blacks by police are rampant. Last year, the Rio de Janeiro police force killed more than 1,000 people. Black women in Brazil also disproportionately suffer violence\u2014a recent study revealed that young black women are twice as likely to suffer from murder as their white counterparts.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn September of 2016, Franco received the fifth-most votes\u2014more than 46,500\u2014to became a councilwoman representing the liberal Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL) in Rio de Janeiro. Her win was remarkable because she grew up in Mar\u00e9, one of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s poorest and most dangerous favelas.\n\nFranco was the only black female representative and one of seven women on the 51-seat council. During her campaign, which was branded with the feminist color of purple, she spoke openly of her favela beginnings and introduced 50 ideas to help women, Afro-Brazilians and favela dwellers. She maintained her campaign promise to help these populations, served as the president of the House Committee on Women and led a committee that monitored Rio de Janeiro\u2019s military intervention.\n\nPhoto: Kiratiana Freelon\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen she became a councilwoman, she continued to radically fight for the black population who suffer extermination in this country,\u201d said Maria Angela, vice president of the PSOL political party in Minas Gerais. \u201cShe never forgot that she was a black woman from the favela. She didn\u2019t align herself with politicians who opposed her values and the population that she represented.\u201d\n\nIt is widely believed that her death is connected to her stance against police violence. Four days before her murder, Franco publicly called a police battalion unit known for its brutality the \u201cmurder unit\u201d and accused it of physically harassing people in a particular favela. The day before her death, she used her Twitter account to acknowledge the death of a young man who was killed by the police as he was leaving a church in a favela.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTranslated to English, the tweet reads, \u201cAnother death of a young man at the hands of the police. Matheus Melo was leaving church. How many more need to die for this war to end?\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cWhat is happening in Acari is absurd! It\u2019s always been happening! The 41st battalion of the military police is known as the battalion of death. This is the beating of the population. This is the killing of our young people!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlavia Oliveira, a respected black columnist for Globo\u2019s newspaper, described the gunshots inflicted upon Franco as shots against the skin of the black woman, the favela dweller, the sociologist, the defender of human rights, the elected representative.\n\n\n\n\u201cMarielle was a black woman who worked on behalf of the community. Instead of selfishly caring for her own life, her daughter and her companion, she wanted to improve a society that is as unequal as it was violent,\u201d wrote Oliveira in a column entitled, \u201cMultiple murders in just one.\u201d\n\n\n\nNascimento, still visually shaken from Franco\u2019s death, remembered that Franco decided to pursue human rights because she lost her best friend to gun violence in the favela. \u201cShe managed to unite people across class and race boundaries while still staying true to her work on behalf of people in favelas,\u201d Nascimento said. \u201cWe are talking about a brilliant black woman, who represented so many people. But this is what Brazil does. The people who are progressive in Brazil are not respected and they are killed.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarielle leaves behind a partner and a teenage daughter.\n\n\n\nIn the hours before her murder, Franco participated in a roundtable discussion with 30 other black women.

But he\u2019s also all about making sure he represents his city.\n\nGilbert serves as the president of the Dade League of Cities, he\u2019s on the board of the National League of Cities, he\u2019s on the advisory board of the U.S. Conference of Mayors and he\u2019s the incoming president of the African-American Mayors Association.\n\nHe\u2019s proud to be the voice that represents the 113,000 people who live in his city. \u201cI\u2019m a kid who grew up there who has the privilege of being the mayor of his hometown,\u201d Gilbert said, referencing his loyalty to home.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany people know Miami proper, especially South Beach, but there\u2019s more to Miami than tanned skin and toned physiques. There\u2019s plenty of culture. In fact, the mayor wears yet another hat: He\u2019s the executive producer of Jazz in the Gardens, a premier event featuring shows from a few of your favorite artists: Anita Baker, Chaka Khan, Fantasia, Joe, Smokey Robinson and more.\n\n\n\nThis event marks 12 years of culture and art through many genres, including soul, jazz and R&B. It\u2019s no wonder that an event like this is held in a city like Miami Gardens. This city is the largest black city in Florida and one of the largest black cities in the country.\n\n\n\nMayor Gilbert\u2019s goal is to build places where people can live, work and play. In addition to the Jazz in the Gardens show, there are many other reasons why you should consider visiting one of the the blackest cities in the country.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root: What\u2019s the importance of being the mayor of a black-run city?\n\nOliver Gilbert: Hope built this city. Hope is undefeated. It\u2019s worth noting that we\u2019re not just exceptional as a black city, we\u2019re exceptional as any city. We\u2019ve doubled the number of people who are opening businesses in the city every year that I\u2019ve been mayor.\n\nThere are stereotypes and preconceived notions that you can\u2019t do it right. We\u2019ve increased our bond rating, increased our reserves. We dedicated $60 million to transforming public space so that kids can learn science, technology, engineering, mathematics, culinary arts, recording studios and television production.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEssentially, what government is is our agreement with each other that we\u2019re going to live in a certain place, in a certain way. What our laws and what our budget should reflect are what our values are. So our values are making it better for our kids, make creating a better place for them. Enlarging their imagination, empowering them to dream bigger dreams and go further.\n\nTR: What makes you a unique mayor?\n\nOG: I have the best city in the country because I know who we were, who we are and who we can be. People talk about police officers\u2014I\u2019m going to take young kids from this community and put them in police academy. I\u2019m going to show you what community policing looks like. They said it was impossible. Now we\u2019re on our fourth plan. So, look, when they say it can\u2019t be done, what I say is \u201cOK\u201d and I go to work. I believe that anything\u2019s possible. That\u2019s what history\u2019s shown me. Anything is possible if you\u2019re willing to work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Tell me more about Jazz in the Gardens.\n\nOG: It was literally a parking lot. We changed a parking lot into something extraordinary, but that\u2019s because we\u2019re dedicated to it. We show that same dedication to our kids and to our government services. We understand that the city is one thing, a community is something else. So, I\u2019m the mayor of a city, but I\u2019m helping to build a community.\n\nWe have a lot of entertainment, but what\u2019s going on on the stage is just a little bit of it. What\u2019s going on in that audience is people connecting; it\u2019s the creation of a feeling that you will remember that will bring you back to my hometown, Miami Gardens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: What can you say about people who perceive Miami in a negative way?\n\nOG: The bad headline isn\u2019t actually the story. You might have something violent that happened that\u2019s the headline, but the story are the kids that are winning chess championships, the coding classes that are going on, the overemphasis on arts, the kids from Moonlight. The story is the fact that last year, we had Flo-Rida and Rick Ross, who are both from Miami Gardens as No. 1-No. 2 in sales in the world. That\u2019s the story!\n\nTR: As a black public official, what are your words of encouragement to those who have no hope in light of this administration?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOG: I don\u2019t care about a president who is on Twitter. We survived more than that. I know what we have done, so I know what we can do. This is for that student and every other person who looks at the news and is pessimistic about our future. And inheritance of hope is an indelible part of the American evolution. Because without hope, independence remains a colony. Slaves remain in servitude. The franchise is never female. Civil rights are always criminal. Education is never public. And labor happens without reward, without hope. And the White House is forever a White House.\n\n\n\nThat hope still lives in us. It is not lost to hate or division or fear or [fearmongers]. It is forever the dawn. I believe that. That belief is not born from a naive belief in the internal, it rises from what history was and what we are. I\u2019m looking at what hope has done as an indicator of what hope can do. Hope has changed the world. So hope can change the world. Hope is forever. We should all remain vigilant.\n\n\n\nTR: And why should people come to Jazz in the Gardens?\n\nOG: We want to bring you to Miami Gardens. We\u2019re going to keep your attention with who we are. I believe in my residents. I believe in my city. I believe in this event. We just need a shot.

I then began to see alcohol as something to be savored and experienced.\n\n\n\nThis is especially true for brown liquor. Because only with the brown nectar from the gods can one find such an intense depth and density of flavor. It is, to my mind, this intensity that makes brown liquor uniquely suited to certain songs. In fact, there are songs that, upon first listen, I can immediately identify as \u201csonic brown liquor.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn order for a track to qualify as a \u201cbrown liquor\u201d song, it must meet certain criteria. 1) It must have a pronounced bass line; 2) this bass line must be contrasted with an ethereal harmony; and 3) the sonic tension between these juxtapositions must evoke a mood that is either libidinous or mournful in nature.\n\n\n\nMany songs produce this feeling. Keith Sweat and Gerald Levert are two men who built entire careers off of an ability to make songs that would make it onto a \u201cbrown liquor\u201d playlist, but below, I offer 10 of the best brown-liquor songs of all time.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. \u201cTurn Off the Lights\u201d by Teddy Pendergrass\n\nTeddy specializes in telling his lover what to do. He has a number of songs with commanding titles like \u201cClose the Door\u201d and \u201cCome Go With Me,\u201d but \u201cTurn Off the Lights\u201d is Pendergrass\u2019 magnum opus. I recommend you pair this with a hot-oil massage and a Jameson on the rocks.\n\n\n\n2. \u201cI\u2019d Rather Be With You\u201d by Bootsy Collins\n\nPlayful and whimsical, this song off the 1976 album Stretchin\u2019 Out in Bootsy\u2019s Rubber Band is a masterpiece of bass. One might miss what he is up to sonically if one listens only to the lyrics and the way he delivers them with tongue firmly in cheek, but the former bass player for James Brown and Parliament Funkadelic puts on a guitar clinic with this track. I suggest pairing this song with Jack Daniels, ginger ale and a lemon wedge.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \u201cMe and Those Dreamin\u2019 Eyes of Mine\u201d by D\u2019Angelo\n\nOne could forget that D\u2019Angelo\u2019s first album is a masterpiece of mood. It\u2019s not the earthy soul that he exhibits in Voodoo and Black Messiah but, rather, a polished entry into the then-burgeoning movement we later called neo-soul. \u201cMe and Those Dreamin\u2019 Eyes of Mine\u201d is a standout track that perfectly captures the feelings of longing that drinking too much brown can inspire. This is best accompanied with Crown Royal on ice.\n\n\n\n4. \u201cOh Girl\u201d by Raphael Saadiq\n\nSaadiq\u2019s genius has never been fully appreciated. Who else could make a tuba work on an R&B track? \u201cOh Girl\u201d (not the remix featuring Jay-Z) is the man from Oakland, Calif., at the height of his powers. A throwback in sound design and songwriting structure to 1950s and \u201960s R&B, \u201cOh Girl\u201d is the perfect song to play in the background as you sip a Macallan Fine Oak 18-year-old scotch.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On\u201d by Marvin Gaye\n\nBeing black in America is enough to drive one to the bottle. Some days one wonders if things will ever get better.

In its report, the GAO made its assessment of MWO-firm access to all of them.\n\nFederal employees pay into federal plans from their salaries during their careers, and asset managers invest funds so that they build equity. Some of these entities include the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, the Federal Reserve System and the National Railway Retirement Investment Trust. Representatives from the GAO interviewed decision-makers from these entities to determine how well they were working to create opportunities for minority- and women-owned asset-management firms.\n\nVerdict: not good at all.\n\nIn some instances, none of the plans used MWO firms. Others used vey few. At BlackRock, a publicly traded asset-management firm that oversees three federal plans, just 1.6 percent of its managers are African American, while 81.5 percent are white; 13.5 percent are Asian.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the reasons minority- or women-owned businesses don\u2019t get as much of the asset-management pie is that, unless an entity specifically asks for a minority- or women-owned firm, consultants tasked with job searches will not even consider them, according to the report. Another issue is that there is a bias against using MWO firms because it is assumed that they will not perform as well as white ones, even though there is no data backing up that assumption, the report found. The GAO cited industry studies that reveal there is no difference between the performance of an MWO and a non-MWO firm.\n\nThe lack of opportunities that minority-owned firms get to handle federally managed dollars should concern Congress and Americans in general, said Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.).\n\n\u201cFederal employees are paying into this, and federal employees reflect the wonderful diversity of our nation,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when you have high-quality, strong-performing [asset] managers who don\u2019t give [MWO firms] a shot to manage some of these funds, it flies in the face of our values as a nation of equal opportunities and inclusion.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Booker arrived in Washington in 2013, tackling asset-management diversity in contracting was one of the first issues he took on. A year later, he and Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) held a summit with pension-fund administrators to find out why there were so few MWO firms getting a shot to manage federal assets.\n\nOne issue is that the process of how to apply for contracts is not very clear or made readily available to prospective minority-owned firms. Firm size is another challenge. Institutional investors often require firms to have a minimum of threshold assets under management\u2014usually $1 billion, at the very least; liability insurance; as well as lengthy track records that smaller firms usually do not have.\n\nBut the dearth of ethnic and gender diversity is not the only issue with having federal assets managed by a select few firms. A major concern for Meeks is the potential for a security breach of a firm managing a lion\u2019s share of assets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you have a cyber breach of that firm, it would impact all of the federal employees,\u201d Meeks said. \u201cBut if you broke it down so that you had many small firms, it would not have an effect over the broad scope of everyone, and it better diversifies what those risks may be.\u201d\n\nAs bleak as the report\u2019s findings were, there were some recommendations for improvement. Federal investment entities could create minority-centered competitions that are marketed to firms that historically have been excluded from federal bidding. Adjusting high thresholds for assets under management, liability insurance and years of management experience would ensure that smaller firms were eligible to apply.\n\nThe report emphasized that the leadership of pension funds and various government plans has to prioritize diversity, and the consultants hired to search for asset managers have to diversify their Rolodexes beyond their typical recruiting pools. Meeks stressed that adjusting these thresholds isn\u2019t the same as lowering standards. To the contrary, it is about access to the bidding process that is proportionate to a firm, regardless of size.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked what he and his colleagues would do to ensure that MWO firms get federal asset-management jobs in the future, Booker said that he would continue challenging fund administrators to accept the GAO\u2019s recommendations on diversifying the firms that are handing their assets.\n\n\u201cIf they have such little amounts of diversity or do not have a [diversity] program, that\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d Booker said. \u201cThe more we can shine a light on the problem and demonstrate there are constructive things they could be doing, the more quickly we\u2019re going to see changes being made.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["meeks", "diversity", "mwo", "minority", "firms", "assetmanagement", "contracts", "report", "federal", "plans", "firm", "getting"], "polarity": 0.026336545399045397, "subjectivity": 0.3772763000888001},

The film has been applauded by black people across the world for touching on the complex relationships between Africans and African Americans, for serving up positive images of African culture for global audiences, and for providing a vehicle that allows black people throughout the world to showcase their heritage and their pride.\n\n\n\nAs a recent article from The Intercept explains, this influence has shown up in Brazil in the form of rolezinho pretoi, which roughly translates to \u201cblack stroll,\u201d in which large groups of Afro-Brazilians turn up together to walk about an area. The stroll has a recent history of being a form of protest in Brazil.\n\nIn the Intercept piece, one group of Afro-Brazilians coordinated a rolezinho to watch Black Panther at one of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s most exclusive high-end shopping malls, Leblon. As the writer notes, Leblon is couched in one of the most affluent areas in Brazil and is also a predominantly white space in a country where the majority of the population now identifies as black or mixed race.\n\nThis made the Black Panther screening as much a political act as a celebration.\n\nFrom The Intercept:\n\nOrganizers would start an event on Facebook and call for everyone to meet at a certain mall at a certain time. Young, mostly dark-skinned residents of the city\u2019s poor and working-class neighborhoods on the urban periphery would take a sometimes one- or two-hour train or bus ride to shopping centers in the bougiest enclaves and just go for a walkabout. In some cases, thousands showed up, much to the horror of Brazil\u2019s white elite, whose ever-present racial and class-based fears were palpable. Malls, including Shopping Leblon, closed down in anticipation of these protests. Others were broken up with tear gas and rubber bullets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rolezinho for the global blockbuster, then, was a way to celebrate blackness in a highly visible way, to reclaim a highly segregated and exclusive space.\n\nReinaldo Junior, an actor who participated in a recent rolezinho, told The Intercept, \u201cWe wanted to occupy this space today to say, \u2018We are alive.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe almost never see any of our people in this kind of space. It\u2019s as though this space is only meant for white people,\u201d said Lucin\u00edo Janu\u00e1rio, another actor. \u201cSo when we have a film written by black man, with black actors and black producers, we felt it was our duty to occupy this space so we could serve as an example.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYgor Marinho, a 28-year-old student who participated in the recent rolezinho and watched Black Panther for the first time, said that the movie\u2019s black-majority cast filled him with pride.\n\n\u201cIt makes me want to win. It makes me want to fight. It makes me like myself more, like my own skin tone, like my kind of hair, like the shape of my nose, like the shape of my lips, like myself more,\u201d Marinho told The Intercept, \u201cbecause you start to see people who are like you, and you see how they carry themselves\u2014empowered, happy with themselves\u2014and you start to like yourself better.\u201d", "keywords": ["whitedominant", "shopping", "panther", "inspires", "spaces", "makes", "recent", "intercept", "rolezinho", "space", "start", "black", "occupy", "brazilians", "white"], "polarity": 0.11405685932001719, "subjectivity": 0.4190486316802105},

As a councilwoman from the Mar\u00e9 favela, she denounced the police brutality that favela residents, most of them black, regularly experienced.\n\nOn Wednesday around 9:20 p.m., armed men gunned the councilwoman down in her car in the center of Rio de Janeiro with nine shots\u2014four to the head. Her driver, Anderson Pedro Gomes, also died. She had just left an event that she organized about black women\u2019s empowerment.\n\n\n\nHer death touched so many people that supporters organized vigils and protests in more than 20 cities across Brazil. Most of these protests were against the genocide of black people in Brazil. For Afro-Brazilians, Franco proved that a black person from a favela could be educated, have dignity and also fight against the social injustice that black Brazilians suffer from every day. For women, she proved that they could overcome sexism and machismo in Brazil. But her death is hitting Afro-Brazilian women, who suffer the most from Brazil\u2019s violent, racist and sexist society, the hardest.\n\n\u201cShe died because she was a combative black woman,\u201d said Lua Nascimento, an Afro-Brazilian college classmate of Franco\u2019s who attended a protest on her behalf in Salvador, Brazil. \u201cShe was executed because she was a black favela dweller who fought against the murder of black favela dwellers. The genocide of the black population continues in this country.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThousands of people gathered in front of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s council chambers to pay homage to Franco, who was buried Thursday night. To show their digital support for her, Brazilians are changing their Facebook profile photos to those of Franco and using the hashtag #MariellePresente, which translates to \u201cMarielle is here.\u201d\n\nAmnesty International, the longtime leader of a campaign against the genocide of black people in Brazil, demanded that her death be rigorously investigated. With those nine shots, Franco became one more statistic in this genocide. Just over 50 percent of Brazil\u2019s population of 200 million is black. But blacks account for 2 out of every 3 murders. They are also overrepresented in favelas where violence and murder of blacks by police are rampant. Last year, the Rio de Janeiro police force killed more than 1,000 people. Black women in Brazil also disproportionately suffer violence\u2014a recent study revealed that young black women are twice as likely to suffer from murder as their white counterparts.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn September of 2016, Franco received the fifth-most votes\u2014more than 46,500\u2014to became a councilwoman representing the liberal Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL) in Rio de Janeiro. Her win was remarkable because she grew up in Mar\u00e9, one of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s poorest and most dangerous favelas.\n\nFranco was the only black female representative and one of seven women on the 51-seat council. During her campaign, which was branded with the feminist color of purple, she spoke openly of her favela beginnings and introduced 50 ideas to help women, Afro-Brazilians and favela dwellers. She maintained her campaign promise to help these populations, served as the president of the House Committee on Women and led a committee that monitored Rio de Janeiro\u2019s military intervention.\n\nPhoto: Kiratiana Freelon\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen she became a councilwoman, she continued to radically fight for the black population who suffer extermination in this country,\u201d said Maria Angela, vice president of the PSOL political party in Minas Gerais. \u201cShe never forgot that she was a black woman from the favela. She didn\u2019t align herself with politicians who opposed her values and the population that she represented.\u201d\n\nIt is widely believed that her death is connected to her stance against police violence. Four days before her murder, Franco publicly called a police battalion unit known for its brutality the \u201cmurder unit\u201d and accused it of physically harassing people in a particular favela. The day before her death, she used her Twitter account to acknowledge the death of a young man who was killed by the police as he was leaving a church in a favela.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTranslated to English, the tweet reads, \u201cAnother death of a young man at the hands of the police. Matheus Melo was leaving church. How many more need to die for this war to end?\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cWhat is happening in Acari is absurd! It\u2019s always been happening! The 41st battalion of the military police is known as the battalion of death. This is the beating of the population. This is the killing of our young people!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlavia Oliveira, a respected black columnist for Globo\u2019s newspaper, described the gunshots inflicted upon Franco as shots against the skin of the black woman, the favela dweller, the sociologist, the defender of human rights, the elected representative.\n\n\n\n\u201cMarielle was a black woman who worked on behalf of the community. Instead of selfishly caring for her own life, her daughter and her companion, she wanted to improve a society that is as unequal as it was violent,\u201d wrote Oliveira in a column entitled, \u201cMultiple murders in just one.\u201d\n\n\n\nNascimento, still visually shaken from Franco\u2019s death, remembered that Franco decided to pursue human rights because she lost her best friend to gun violence in the favela. \u201cShe managed to unite people across class and race boundaries while still staying true to her work on behalf of people in favelas,\u201d Nascimento said. \u201cWe are talking about a brilliant black woman, who represented so many people. But this is what Brazil does. The people who are progressive in Brazil are not respected and they are killed.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarielle leaves behind a partner and a teenage daughter.\n\n\n\nIn the hours before her murder, Franco participated in a roundtable discussion with 30 other black women.

Perhaps you\u2019ve never seen the original Roots or have not fully memorized the entire catalog of Luther Vandross. When those around you discover this lapse in your black cultural conditioning, the threat is issued: \u201cWe\u2019re going to revoke your black card.\u201d That is, your inclusion in the collective black community is going to be rescinded.\n\nMine has been threatened for a number of reasons: I haven\u2019t seen every episode of Good Times; I didn\u2019t like hot sauce until I was in my mid-30s; I think John Singleton\u2019s Baby Boy is an earnest yet overrated film\u2014and those are the minor offenses. There are three main reasons why my black card has almost been revoked, and one reason it\u2019ll never be taken away.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not a fan of Anita Baker\u2019s music.\n\nI see that she is talented. I recognize and respect her unique voice. Her music just comes off as so damn \u2026 old. The lush instrumentals and, in my eyes, excessive vocalizations rub me the wrong way. I don\u2019t begrudge anyone who is a fan; it\u2019s just not for me.\n\nWhen listening to Anita Baker, I feel as if I should be wearing a leather baseball hat while rocking a velour sweatsuit and Stacy Adams shoes.

They sell them every other week, and it\u2019ll probably come with green beans, mashed potatoes and a roll. If that fails, I\u2019ll go to Popeyes. Not because it\u2019s great\u2014just because it\u2019s there.\n\nMy theory about why Popeyes is so popular is simple: Black folks are able to get the flavor of hot sauce on decently seasoned chicken without actually having to put hot sauce on the chicken. Now, to be sure, there are many who still put hot sauce on Popeyes spicy chicken, but I hold to my hypothesis.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI hate Tyler Perry\u2019s films.\n\nHate-watching is defined as watching something for the sake of the enjoyment one derives from mocking or criticizing it. I\u2019ve seen every single Tyler Perry movie (save for Madea\u2019s Christmas\u2014I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to sit through that one), and I\u2019ve hated every one except Daddy\u2019s Little Girls\u2014and that was only because of the all-consuming charisma of Idris Elba.\n\nPerry\u2019s films are not just bad; they are case studies in horrific filmmaking. He uses good actors, but he fails them with poor editing, bad scripts and one-dimensional characters. He is an auteur in the worst-possible way: His films are almost uniformly bad. His moralizing is also off-putting. One need only watch Temptation to see how this impulse hurts his filmmaking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile my articulation of the above has often put my black card in danger, it has never successfully been taken away, for one simple reason:\n\n\n\nBlack people are not monolithic.\n\nContrary to white supremacist narratives about what it means to be black, we, as a people, do not all like the same things. There are black comic book readers, like Deborah Whaley, who were once on the margins of black culture but are now in the mainstream. There is the Afropunk band Rough Francis, who took up the mantle of the underappreciated Detroit black proto-punk band Death. There is even the brilliant Chance the Rapper, who brings his nerdy, gospel-influenced sensibilities to bear upon postmodern hip-hop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlackness is no one thing. We are a complex, beautiful people. The next time someone tries to take away your black card, ask that person if he or she has read Frantz Fanon or W.E.B. Du Bois or Ralph Ellison or Richard Wright or Kiese Laymon, or if he or she has seen Charles Burnett\u2019s Killer of Sheep or Julie Dash\u2019s Daughters of the Dust. You\u2019ll discover that we all have cultural blind spots\u2014or things about which we disagree. We should celebrate our variations instead of seeking uniformity \u2026 unless you don\u2019t like Prince.

She has big breasts and large lips,\u201d Eliane Pereira, a lawyer in Rio de Janeiro, tells The Glow Up. \u201cThis comes from the time period of slavery, when we were colonized and the black woman was always seen as an object. This woman does not represent me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe history of the Nega Maluca blackface is closely intertwined with the history of black women in Brazil. The 1950s Carnival song \u201cNega Maluca\u201d tells the story of a black woman who works as a domestic servant and is impregnated by her white boss\u2014something that was common back then. When she demands that the father claim the baby, she is called a \u201cnega maluca\u201d\u2014a crazy black woman.\n\nIn the 75 years after slavery ended in Brazil, the most common form of work for a black woman was working as a domestic servant, often living in her boss\u2019s house. To popularize the song, the composer started to include the image of Nega Maluca, interpreted by a white man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis history of Nega Maluca is hidden on the internet, because today, Nega Maluca is also the name of a Brazilian chocolate cake.\n\nLawyer Marina Mar\u00e7al dreamed of parading with the Mangueira samba school\u2014Rio de Janeiro\u2019s most prestigious and traditional samba school. A samba school is a cultural organization created by blacks in Rio de Janeiro 90 years ago to celebrate samba music during Carnival. Since their founding, the groups have evolved into Brazil\u2019s biggest Carnival attraction. Thousands of costumed people parade each year in the biggest schools.\n\nMar\u00e7al joined the Mangueira school as a \u201ccommunity\u201d member\u2014a discounted way to participate in the Carnival parade without having to pay an outrageous fee, and the main way blacks participate in Carnival. One month after she joined the school, she learned that one of the sections would have some people dressed in the Nega Maluca costume.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMar\u00e7al says that she tried to reason with Mangueira\u2019s officials. She explained the racist history of the costume and why it should not be in the school\u2019s parade. But she said that school officials disagreed and kept the costume in the parade because they felt it was art and not racism.\n\n\n\n\u201cRacism is not an opinion but a crime,\u201d said Mar\u00e7al, who will soon receive a master\u2019s degree in race relations. \u201cWhen you are showing a racist persona of a black woman in a section that includes black women who are saying that Nega Maluca is very offensive, those concerns ought to be taken seriously.\u201d\n\nMar\u00e7al left the Mangueira samba school, and for the last two months, she has tried to educate as many people as possible about the racist origins of the Nega Maluca costume. Seventeen black women were interviewed for a documentary on its origins titled, Nega Maluca N\u00e3o. And Rio de Janeiro\u2019s women\u2019s law association hosted a forum on Nega Maluca right before Carnival.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven a parade that exalted the history and heritage of black women used blackface.\n\nThe theme for the Salgueiro samba school was \u201cSenhoras do Ventre do Mundo,\u201d which translates to \u201cWomen of the Womb of the World,\u201d meant to celebrate the history of black women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe school\u2019s dance group was composed of men dressed as women, with their faces painted black. The costumes of the drum section, consisting of black and white people, were inspired by the images of the 25th dynasty of Nubia, and those performers also had their faces painted black. But while the public loved their celebration of black women, the blackface costumes dominated the social media discussion.\n\nA modern form of blackface also reared its head at this year\u2019s street Carnival festivities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSinger Jojo Todynho\u2019s song \u201cQue Tiro Foi Esse (What Are These Gunshots)\u201d is a hit in Brazil. But before her popular funk song brought her national fame, she was well-known on the internet for proudly displaying her triple-G breasts in skimpy Brazilian bikinis. This Carnival, she became a costume, with white women and men wearing large, fake brown breasts and black wigs and sometimes even painting their skin dark.\n\nBut though the tradition continues, there is increasing resistance. In Minas Gerais, the carnival bloco Domesticas de Lixo (Male Domestic Servants of Trash) consists of white men who dress up as black domestic servants as a way to pay homage to the domestic servant. This year, several black YouTube bloggers mounted a campaign against the bloco, which celebrated its 60th anniversary by receiving a key to the city from the mayor. At least a dozen Afro-Brazilians protested the bloco\u2019s parade two weeks ago.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMar\u00e7al says that she thinks blackface in Brazil will end only if Brazilians start listening to Afro-Brazilian women.\n\n\u201cCarnival comes from black culture, but they ignore the opinions of black people,\u201d she says.\n\n", "keywords": ["school", "woman", "brazils", "nega", "maluca", "2018", "women", "black", "carnival", "misogynoir", "blackface", "samba", "white"], "polarity": -0.047854526425955016, "subjectivity": 0.4117739403453689},

As a councilwoman from the Mar\u00e9 favela, she denounced the police brutality that favela residents, most of them black, regularly experienced.\n\nOn Wednesday around 9:20 p.m., armed men gunned the councilwoman down in her car in the center of Rio de Janeiro with nine shots\u2014four to the head. Her driver, Anderson Pedro Gomes, also died. She had just left an event that she organized about black women\u2019s empowerment.\n\n\n\nHer death touched so many people that supporters organized vigils and protests in more than 20 cities across Brazil. Most of these protests were against the genocide of black people in Brazil. For Afro-Brazilians, Franco proved that a black person from a favela could be educated, have dignity and also fight against the social injustice that black Brazilians suffer from every day. For women, she proved that they could overcome sexism and machismo in Brazil. But her death is hitting Afro-Brazilian women, who suffer the most from Brazil\u2019s violent, racist and sexist society, the hardest.\n\n\u201cShe died because she was a combative black woman,\u201d said Lua Nascimento, an Afro-Brazilian college classmate of Franco\u2019s who attended a protest on her behalf in Salvador, Brazil. \u201cShe was executed because she was a black favela dweller who fought against the murder of black favela dwellers. The genocide of the black population continues in this country.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThousands of people gathered in front of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s council chambers to pay homage to Franco, who was buried Thursday night. To show their digital support for her, Brazilians are changing their Facebook profile photos to those of Franco and using the hashtag #MariellePresente, which translates to \u201cMarielle is here.\u201d\n\nAmnesty International, the longtime leader of a campaign against the genocide of black people in Brazil, demanded that her death be rigorously investigated. With those nine shots, Franco became one more statistic in this genocide. Just over 50 percent of Brazil\u2019s population of 200 million is black. But blacks account for 2 out of every 3 murders. They are also overrepresented in favelas where violence and murder of blacks by police are rampant. Last year, the Rio de Janeiro police force killed more than 1,000 people. Black women in Brazil also disproportionately suffer violence\u2014a recent study revealed that young black women are twice as likely to suffer from murder as their white counterparts.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn September of 2016, Franco received the fifth-most votes\u2014more than 46,500\u2014to became a councilwoman representing the liberal Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL) in Rio de Janeiro. Her win was remarkable because she grew up in Mar\u00e9, one of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s poorest and most dangerous favelas.\n\nFranco was the only black female representative and one of seven women on the 51-seat council. During her campaign, which was branded with the feminist color of purple, she spoke openly of her favela beginnings and introduced 50 ideas to help women, Afro-Brazilians and favela dwellers. She maintained her campaign promise to help these populations, served as the president of the House Committee on Women and led a committee that monitored Rio de Janeiro\u2019s military intervention.\n\nPhoto: Kiratiana Freelon\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen she became a councilwoman, she continued to radically fight for the black population who suffer extermination in this country,\u201d said Maria Angela, vice president of the PSOL political party in Minas Gerais. \u201cShe never forgot that she was a black woman from the favela. She didn\u2019t align herself with politicians who opposed her values and the population that she represented.\u201d\n\nIt is widely believed that her death is connected to her stance against police violence. Four days before her murder, Franco publicly called a police battalion unit known for its brutality the \u201cmurder unit\u201d and accused it of physically harassing people in a particular favela. The day before her death, she used her Twitter account to acknowledge the death of a young man who was killed by the police as he was leaving a church in a favela.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTranslated to English, the tweet reads, \u201cAnother death of a young man at the hands of the police. Matheus Melo was leaving church. How many more need to die for this war to end?\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cWhat is happening in Acari is absurd! It\u2019s always been happening! The 41st battalion of the military police is known as the battalion of death. This is the beating of the population. This is the killing of our young people!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlavia Oliveira, a respected black columnist for Globo\u2019s newspaper, described the gunshots inflicted upon Franco as shots against the skin of the black woman, the favela dweller, the sociologist, the defender of human rights, the elected representative.\n\n\n\n\u201cMarielle was a black woman who worked on behalf of the community. Instead of selfishly caring for her own life, her daughter and her companion, she wanted to improve a society that is as unequal as it was violent,\u201d wrote Oliveira in a column entitled, \u201cMultiple murders in just one.\u201d\n\n\n\nNascimento, still visually shaken from Franco\u2019s death, remembered that Franco decided to pursue human rights because she lost her best friend to gun violence in the favela. \u201cShe managed to unite people across class and race boundaries while still staying true to her work on behalf of people in favelas,\u201d Nascimento said. \u201cWe are talking about a brilliant black woman, who represented so many people. But this is what Brazil does. The people who are progressive in Brazil are not respected and they are killed.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarielle leaves behind a partner and a teenage daughter.\n\n\n\nIn the hours before her murder, Franco participated in a roundtable discussion with 30 other black women.

She was strong, tall, elegant, gracious, and I saw myself in her. I cried because her beauty was the same type of beauty that I have. It was a relief to see her being celebrated. For many decades in the United States, I was not considered pretty. I was strange. They thought my skin was too dark. My arms and legs were very large.\n\nEvery year, 16 Afro-Brazilian women compete to become the Queen of Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea, an Afro-Bloco carnival group in Salvador, Brazil, that promotes black pride and Afro-Brazilian culture in Brazil. Afro-Brazilians in the neighborhood of Liberdade started Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea in 1975 in resistance to Salvador\u2019s carnival, which at the time excluded blacks. The group derives its heritage from Candombl\u00e9, an Afro-Brazilian religion traditionally led by women. Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea has traditionally been a carnival group for dark-skinned black people in Salvador, and the contestants of the Beleza Negra pageant represent this aesthetic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe goal of the Beleza Negra is to represent black women in a way that Brazilian and international media fail to\u2014as strong, spirit-filled and divine. Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea\u2019s theme this year was \u201c100 Years of Madiba: Nelson Mandela\u201d; contestants represented this in their dresses. The winner of the pageant will now reign as the Queen of Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea\u2019s carnival, and her responsibilities include representing the Afro-Bloco in and outside Brazil, as well as dancing in carnival during the group\u2019s parade.\n\n\u201cThe Goddess of Ebony contest is a validation of representation,\u201d Neal, 35, told a Brazilian newspaper. \u201cIt is very much needed here, [and] all over the world. To me, it says, \u2018I am here, I am valid, I exist, I have a proud history, I have beautiful cultural narratives and I am not alone.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeal traveled back to Salvador to prepare and compete, thanks to a fundraising campaign she started once she learned that Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea had accepted her application for the pageant. On the day she arrived, she went straight from the airport to her first practice with the other contestants, who ranged in age from 18 to their 40s. All but four came from Salvador.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was dropping a kitten in a bunny cage,\u201d said Neal, who is a director, filmmaker, photographer and writer. \u201cThe other contestants didn\u2019t quite know what to make of me. They didn\u2019t know if I was a novelty or serious competitor. I was fatigued, sweating, and my eyes were bloodshot from all the travel.\u201d\n\nShe made waves in Salvador and was featured on the front page of the local newspaper. The local population supported her participation in the pageant, which has traditionally been seen as a way to promote black women from local communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think that the overall impact has been positive,\u201d said Adrian Erik McCray, a longtime African-American expat in Salvador. \u201cThe fact that an African American\u2014\u2018an elite,\u2019 in the eyes of Brazil\u2014chose to participate in something that revives the resistance spirit of Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea is something positive.\u201d\n\nOnce settled in Salvador, Neal scrambled desperately to find someone who could create the two required dresses\u2014one representing Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea and another representing a deity. She then learned a special dance that\u2014more so than beauty\u2014defines the Ebony Goddess.\n\nNeal found a savior in 27-year-old Cec\u00edlia Cadile, an entrepreneur who placed third in last year\u2019s Beleza Negra. Cadile\u2019s involvement in the pageant dates back to when she was a teenager, when her sister competed in the pageant. In the two weeks before the pageant, Cadile worked as Neal\u2019s coach, teaching her the special Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea dance and helping to prepare her two dresses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a already precious stone, and she only needed someone to help bring out the shine in her,\u201d Cadile said.\n\nContestants pose with last year\u2019s Deusa de \u00c9bano, Gisele Santos Soares.

Neal had already developed an intimate relationship with Afro-Brazilian culture and music through her participation in a Brazilian drumming group in the U.S., but she did not grow up with the rhythms and dances of Candombl\u00e9, a handicap she overcame within two weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese women have been doing this all of their lives as part of their experience in Candomble,\u201d Neal said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t born in Candombl\u00e9.\u201d\n\nWhen the moment came for her to perform her dance, Neal put her heart, soul and even stomach into it:\n\nRight before I was about to go on, we were standing in a narrow, one-window hallway backstage, and it was really uncomfortable. I was hot, I was breathless, I was dizzy, I needed to sit down, I needed to stand up. I needed to eat something, I needed to throw up ... all these contradictions! I perform and I\u2019m fine.

To show their digital support for her, Brazilians are changing their Facebook profile photos to those of Franco and using the hashtag #MariellePresente, which translates to \u201cMarielle is here.\u201d\n\nAmnesty International, the longtime leader of a campaign against the genocide of black people in Brazil, demanded that her death be rigorously investigated. With those nine shots, Franco became one more statistic in this genocide. Just over 50 percent of Brazil\u2019s population of 200 million is black. But blacks account for 2 out of every 3 murders. They are also overrepresented in favelas where violence and murder of blacks by police are rampant. Last year, the Rio de Janeiro police force killed more than 1,000 people. Black women in Brazil also disproportionately suffer violence\u2014a recent study revealed that young black women are twice as likely to suffer from murder as their white counterparts.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn September of 2016, Franco received the fifth-most votes\u2014more than 46,500\u2014to became a councilwoman representing the liberal Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL) in Rio de Janeiro. Her win was remarkable because she grew up in Mar\u00e9, one of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s poorest and most dangerous favelas.\n\nFranco was the only black female representative and one of seven women on the 51-seat council. During her campaign, which was branded with the feminist color of purple, she spoke openly of her favela beginnings and introduced 50 ideas to help women, Afro-Brazilians and favela dwellers. She maintained her campaign promise to help these populations, served as the president of the House Committee on Women and led a committee that monitored Rio de Janeiro\u2019s military intervention.\n\nPhoto: Kiratiana Freelon\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen she became a councilwoman, she continued to radically fight for the black population who suffer extermination in this country,\u201d said Maria Angela, vice president of the PSOL political party in Minas Gerais. \u201cShe never forgot that she was a black woman from the favela. She didn\u2019t align herself with politicians who opposed her values and the population that she represented.\u201d\n\nIt is widely believed that her death is connected to her stance against police violence. Four days before her murder, Franco publicly called a police battalion unit known for its brutality the \u201cmurder unit\u201d and accused it of physically harassing people in a particular favela. The day before her death, she used her Twitter account to acknowledge the death of a young man who was killed by the police as he was leaving a church in a favela.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTranslated to English, the tweet reads, \u201cAnother death of a young man at the hands of the police. Matheus Melo was leaving church. How many more need to die for this war to end?\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cWhat is happening in Acari is absurd! It\u2019s always been happening! The 41st battalion of the military police is known as the battalion of death. This is the beating of the population. This is the killing of our young people!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlavia Oliveira, a respected black columnist for Globo\u2019s newspaper, described the gunshots inflicted upon Franco as shots against the skin of the black woman, the favela dweller, the sociologist, the defender of human rights, the elected representative.\n\n\n\n\u201cMarielle was a black woman who worked on behalf of the community. Instead of selfishly caring for her own life, her daughter and her companion, she wanted to improve a society that is as unequal as it was violent,\u201d wrote Oliveira in a column entitled, \u201cMultiple murders in just one.\u201d\n\n\n\nNascimento, still visually shaken from Franco\u2019s death, remembered that Franco decided to pursue human rights because she lost her best friend to gun violence in the favela. \u201cShe managed to unite people across class and race boundaries while still staying true to her work on behalf of people in favelas,\u201d Nascimento said. \u201cWe are talking about a brilliant black woman, who represented so many people. But this is what Brazil does. The people who are progressive in Brazil are not respected and they are killed.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarielle leaves behind a partner and a teenage daughter.\n\n\n\nIn the hours before her murder, Franco participated in a roundtable discussion with 30 other black women.

The city she lived in and schools she attended were mostly white. But when she moved to Campinas, a city of 1 million approximately two hours outside of Sao Paulo, she decided to be proactive.\n\n\u201cI wanted to increase my connection to Afro-Brazilian people,\u201d she says.\n\nThaisa joined Afrodengo, an Afro-Brazilian dating community on Facebook. When she finally got up the nerve to post her photo and introduced herself\u2014a requirement of the community\u2014she noticed that one guy who \u201cliked\u201d her photo lived in her city. His name was Jackson Xavier.\n\nShe reached out to him on Facebook and they immediately started talking. Two days later, they went out on their first date. She instantly liked his intelligence, responsibility and the way he cared for her. He liked her stubbornness, humor and intelligence as well. Five months later, the couple were married. As Jackson explains:\n\nBefore the group, I didn\u2019t even think to look for relationships with black women, and I had never had a black girlfriend. But once I entered the group, I started to focus more on having a relationship with a black person like me because we have similar experiences. The black movement is very strong on the internet, so I entered the group wanting to see more beautiful black people and to have references in my life to black things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfrodengo was created one year ago by Afro-Brazilian journalist and single mother Lorena If\u00e9, 29, to promote love and marriage among Afro-Brazilians. \u201cDengo\u201d is a word with African roots that Brazilians\u2014especially Afro-Brazilians\u2014call people to show love and care. Despite the country\u2019s African origins, hundreds of years of slavery and European colonialism have made affection and stable relationships between black women and black men in Brazil unique and unusual.\n\nNow Afro-Brazilians are flocking to the Afrodengo Facebook group to build relationships that they never before considered having. But If\u00e9 not only wants to spark love among Afro-Brazilians; she also wants to help them build relationships with one another so that they can combat racism in Brazil. She explains:\n\nHaving relationships between black people is a way to combat racism. Only a black person will know how racism affects you and its consequences in our lives. In a society where we learn to hate ourselves, if we unite with people like us, then we can combat racism with something as simple as having a conscious family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo jump-start the group, If\u00e9 invited Afro-Brazilian men and women to post photos and descriptions of themselves. Within a week, it exploded\u2014with both members and photos. At one point, If\u00e9 had more than 10,000 people waiting to be approved to the group. If\u00e9 created an environment where every type of black person, regardless of sexuality, sex, religion or political viewpoint, is welcome.\n\nToday the group is still going strong; having produced at least two marriages and countless couples and friendships. There are more than 100,000 members in the main group and its affiliates (which focus on LGBT members, Christians and body positivity). If\u00e9 plans to turn the Facebook group into an app.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Afro-Brazilians enjoy the group, some white Brazilians consider If\u00e9 and the group racist because it is exclusively for black people. For African Americans, a dating site for black people seems obvious. But for Brazilians, communities restricted by race are always frowned upon. White Brazilians also want to be a part of the group.\n\n\u201cTo this day, I have to deny entrance to white people who want to join the group,\u201d If\u00e9 said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe creation of Afrodengo stems from If\u00e9\u2019s personal experiences pursuing amor afrocentrado\u2014\u201dblack love\u201d\u2014 in Salvador, Brazil. While in a relationship with her son\u2019s father, she felt that their relationship lacked the affection she sees given to white women in Brazil. Soon after they broke up, she tried her hand at online dating and even created a profile on Tinder. But although she lives in a city that is more than 80 percent black, she couldn\u2019t find any black men on the platform.\n\nIf\u00e9 says she wasn\u2019t raised with affection\u2014which is common among poor Afro-Brazilians simply trying to survive. Personally, she longs for a black man who will cherish her intelligence and give her affection when she wants\u2014even when she doesn\u2019t need it. She still longs for an \u201cAfrodengo.\u201d\n\nCreating this Afrodengo [was] a way to help me survive and help others going through a similar situation. It helped me to move on from my relationship and survive my depression.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf\u00e9\u2019s struggle is one that many black women in Brazil share. Many of their lives are marked by loneliness (solid\u00e3o da Mulher Negra) because they aren\u2019t chosen\u2014the chosen women being white women. In Brazil, black and mixed-race women have been traditionally oversexualized or looked upon as domestic servants, while white women are viewed as the perfect women to give affection to and to have a healthy marriage with. It is a given that the more money and education an Afro-Brazilian has, the more likely he will marry a white woman.\n\nTranslating from a YouTube video by anthropologist Ana Cl\u00e1udia Pacheco, a professor at the State University of Bahia:\n\nBecause of historical reasons related to racism, many black women in Brazil suffer from solitude. ... Our choices in who we give affection to and who we choose as a partner are still regulated by and structured by racism and sexism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Afrodengo isn\u2019t just for creating romantic relationships; Afro-Brazilian men and women are using the group to strengthen their black identity and create friendships with Afro-Brazilians across Brazil. Says early adopter Gabriel Rangel, 25, from Rio de Janeiro:\n\nI still haven\u2019t found a relationship through Afrodengo, but now I have friends all over the country, and the group has really opened my mind to the Black Movement in Brazil.\n\nMember Lais Mello entered the group one week after it launched. Adopted by a white family, she\u2019d lacked a strong connection to Afro-Brazilian culture. She created the first city-specific WhatsApp group for Afrodengo, which helped her organize meetups in Salvador and make friends with Afro-Brazilians close to her town in Bahia. Now Mello is a moderator of the group, and credits Afrodengo with increasing her self-esteem and pulling her out of depression:\n\nBefore Afrodengo, I wouldn\u2019t leave the house because of my depression and anxiety. My self-esteem was so low. But now I love going to Afrodengo meetups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf\u00e9 has grand plans for the Afrodengo brand.

It wasn\u2019t until I was 30 years old and I had already experienced so much racism, read tons of books and looked at myself within, that I finally recognized myself as a black woman,\u201d said Almeida, who is a hairstylist.\n\nAnd Almeida wanted to communicate her identity to the world.\n\n\u201cWhen I started to see myself as a black woman, I started looking for aesthetic elements that helped me to form this identity,\u201d she said.\n\nShe discovered turbantes, \u201chead wraps\u201d in Portuguese, and for the last few years she has been wearing turbantes to complement her hair and ethnicity.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Brazil, wearing head wraps is an expression of Afro-Brazilian culture, history and religion. Enslaved Africans brought the tradition from their homelands, and enslaved Afro-Brazilian women continued the tradition by using turbantes during their religious practices or simply to protect their hair. Today, young Afro-Brazilian women are embracing turbantes as an opportunity to assert their blackness in a country where white supremacy rules.\n\nTha\u00eds Muniz, a native of Salvador, Brazil, teaches Afro-Brazilian women how to wear turbantes through her company and brand Turbante.se, which means to \u201chead wrap yourself.\u201d But her lessons aren\u2019t limited to the aesthetics of head wraps. She also focuses on the unique history and politics of head wraps in Brazil, a country where more than 50 percent of the population identifies as black.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I first started researching head wraps years ago, I couldn\u2019t find anything on the internet about Afro-Brazilian women,\u201d said Muniz, who is based in Dublin but is from Salvador, Brazil.\n\nNow she travels across Brazil doing turbante workshops, showing young Afro-Brazilian women how to wear turbantes. Her Instagram and Facebook accounts have more than 60,000 followers combined.\n\n\u201cRight now, young black women in Brazil aren\u2019t wearing turbantes for religious purposes or just aesthetic purposes,\u201d Muniz said at a recent workshop in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cIt\u2019s an act of resistance. It\u2019s a new symbol that we have created of our roots.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe use of turbantes by Afro-Brazilian women goes back to the era of slavery. According to Muniz, the Yoruba people from what is now modern-day Nigeria and Benin were some of the last Africans to be brought to Brazil. Their Yoruba religion led to the creation of the Afro-Brazilians\u2019 Candombl\u00e9 religion, in which women and men wear turbantes on their heads as a form of protection.\n\nOutside of religion, while white women often wore jeweled hats, enslaved black women all over Brazil wore turbantes to carry heavy baskets on their heads and cover their short hair or shaved heads. Eventually, their use as a fashion accessory in the public declined\u2014black women only wore them while cleaning. The turbante became identified with Baianas de Acarajae, women in Salvador who sell acarajae and sweets on the streets, wearing the clothes they would wear to a Candombl\u00e9 ceremony\u2014a white robe and turbante and, sometimes, jewelry. Carmen Miranda, a white Brazilian woman of Portuguese origins, popularized the style of these black women in the 1940s with the song \u201cO que \u00e9 que tem a Baiana tem\u201d (\u201cWhat Does the Baiana Have?\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople look at me and say that I look like Carmen Miranda, which is insulting,\u201d Muniz said. \u201cWhy would someone look at a black woman and associate her with a white woman who romanticized the situation of black women who were enslaved, exploited and sexually abused?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe contemporary valorization of turbantes as a political statement has its roots in Salvador, the blackest city in Brazil. In the \u201970s, Salvador\u2019s Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea carnival group took the turbante in a direction Brazilians had never seen before: The Afro Bloco, created in response to the exclusion of blacks in Salvador\u2019s carnival, combined black pride with fashion, with the turbante as the centerpiece.\n\nDete Lima, one of the female founders of the Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea group, created the signature look of Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea and continues to work as a stylist for the group. As she told a Brazilian newspaper (translated from Portuguese):\n\n\n\nI learned when I was a child to be conscious that I am black and I have to do my part as a militant and uplift my people, my roots and everything related to my history. We are black and we are beautiful ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer contemporary Negra Jh\u00f4 was one of the first black women to wear turbantes in the streets of Salvador back in the \u201970s. From there, she started teaching people how to create elaborate turbantes and hairstyles using braids. Negra Jh\u00f4\u2019s beauty salon in the center of Salvador is an aesthetic reference for Afro-Brazilian women across the country.\n\nAfro-Brazilian women aren\u2019t the only ones embracing turbantes. Their white Brazilian counterparts are, too\u2014and it\u2019s not being received well. In the last few years, Brazilian media and fashion have taken to featuring white women in turbantes, diluting the political statement in favor of a fashion statement. Last year, a white cancer survivor admitted on Facebook that she was being criticized by black women for wearing turbantes. The post was shared more than 38,000 times and sparked the hashtag #VaiTerBrancaDeTurbanteSim, which translates to, \u201cYes, white people will wear head wraps.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Afro-Brazilian women, this is a form of cultural appropriation. When black women wear turbantes, they are often discriminated against in stores, on the streets, even at university. Shortly after the #VaiTerBrancaDeTurbanteSim hashtag took off, Dandara Tonantzin Castro suffered harassment from several men when she wore her turbante at a university graduation. In a Facebook post titled \u201cOur Presence Makes Them Uncomfortable,\u201d Castro described how a young man pulled at her turbante.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Thais Muniz, rather than restrict white people from wearing turbantes, it\u2019s more important that people understand the history and meaning of turbantes for Afro-Brazilians. But as she told The Glow Up, she understands the discrepancy in the respect that white women receive when they wear turbantes: \u201cWhenever you have a white body dressed in a turbante alongside a black body, the white person will always be the one valued more.\u201d", "keywords": ["brazil", "turbantes", "woman", "wear", "head", "political", "fashion", "turbante", "black", "history", "statement", "reemergence", "brazilian", "women", "white", "afrobrazilian", "deeply"], "polarity": 0.03785922912428938, "subjectivity": 0.34405935430031837},

Like a mother preparing her home for 500,000 tourists, Rio has swept the city's poverty under the rug by increasing police and army presence in favelas. As a result, part of the local population isn\u2019t that anxious about the games. Militarized police presence and violence are only some of the issues that have affected the Afro-Brazilian population living in Rio since the possibility of sports mega events such as the World Cup in 2014, and now the Olympic Games, became a reality in Brazil.\n\n\"Urban segregation in Rio de Janeiro was aggravated with the preparation to receive the sports mega events,\" anthropologist Luciane O. Rocha, a researcher at the Nucleo de Estudos da Cidadania Conflito e Viol\u00eancia Urbana of the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, told The Root. \"While the investments in housing and the majority of the spatial structure for the games were constructed in privileged areas, to the poorest areas were destined only violent actions from the policy and the army.\"\n\nSince 2014, the black population of Rio has complained that the government has been increasing police presence in favela communities, which aggravates an already problematic issue of violence between the poor and the police. Also, in 2014, Rio de Janeiro\u2019s former governor Sergio Cabral requested the presence of military forces in the state to help pacify favela communities. More than 20,000 military officers are reported to be part of the security force for the Olympics. But it isn't just the increased police presence that has many concerned; racial profiling of poor black youths inside the public transportation has also increased, and some have reportedly been denied access to wealthy neighborhoods close to beach areas.\n\nIn August 2015, Secretariat of Security Jos\u00e9 Mariano Beltrame decided to control gang-related robberies in beach areas by requesting that the military police approach poor black youths and demand to see their documents, even removing them from buses while they were trying to go to the beach.\n\n\u201cThe media put the population against the youth that only wanted go to the beach, when we had almost 90-degree [days],\" actor and journalist Ernesto Xavier said. \"They were arresting the minors and left them [the] whole day in a police station with no food or water, releasing them only at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs tension grew between the poor and the police, the number of black deaths increased. In 2015 more than 480 black men were killed by the police in Rio. One of the victims of the over-policing of favelas was 30-year-old Vitor Santiago. On Feb. 11, 2015, Santiago and some friends were returning to the Complexo da Mar\u00e9, a group of favela communities in Rio's north side, after watching a soccer team play when the army, which was patrolling the area, reportedly opened fire on the car they were riding in. The car was hit with 762 bullets.\n\nSantiago would suffer a punctured lung and have his leg amputated. The damage done to his bone marrow after the shooting rendered Santiago a paraplegic.\n\n\"I have a lot of needs; I can\u2019t work anymore because someone needs to take care of my son,\" Santiago's mother, Irone Santiago, said. \"Everything the government promised to me didn\u2019t work. I don\u2019t have home care, the diapers that my son is using were a donation from people in the community. I\u2019m still waiting on a neurosurgeon to evaluate my son.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIrone Santiago claims that the government called the shooting a \"mistake\" and notes that she has yet to receive any financial support from the state, the federal government or the army.\n\nFor many black residents like VItor Santiago, Brazil's Olympic legacy will be more about violence and exclusion, since the games don't feel welcoming to those who live in the poor parts of the city.\n\n\"Olympics for whom?\" Irone Santiago asks. \"These games are made with the blood of our sons.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDaniela Gomes, who is from Sao Paulo, is a Ph.D. candidate in African and African Diaspora studies at the University of Texas at Austin and a journalist.

How could he forget who put him there?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn return, Doug Jones and the Democratic Party, once again, have thrown black people to the wolves.\n\nPolitico magazine reports that on Wednesday, the Senate passed a bank-deregulation bill that rolls back many of the regulations imposed on banks and lenders. The bill passed with the support of the Trump administration, Republican senators and 17 Democratic senators\u2014most of whom are considered to be moderate or conservative Dems. The legislation now moves to the House of Representatives, where it is expected to pass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more than a decade I have been trying to push the idea that blackness has evolved past its murky racial and cultural definition. As a college macroeconomics instructor, I taught a class, Race as an Economic Construct, that advocated examining race through the lens of data and numbers. (The science of economics is not limited to the production and distribution of goods, services and wealth.)\n\nOne of the easiest ways to illustrate this point is with the history of black homeownership. Homeownership is the biggest builder of wealth in America and is still affected by the history of segregation, Jim Crow and redlining. It fuels every indicator of discrimination in this country and is one of the best examples of the manifestation of white supremacy.\n\nHousing discrimination relegated African Americans to homogeneous, poor black communities with underfunded, segregated schools. Poorer schools create the education gap. The education gap creates employment disparities. Underemployment creates poverty and the phenomenon called \u201cblack-on-black crime.\u201d Poverty leads to the inability to acquire affordable housing, which relegates black people to low-income communities, which leads to underfunded schools, which leads to more crime and so on. It is a vicious circle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is all about homeownership.\n\nWe have always known this. The Root has routinely reported on the difficulties black people encounter when buying a home. A recent report by the Center for Investigative Reporting, along with Reveal News, uncovered how U.S. banks systematically prevent blacks and Hispanics from becoming homeowners.\n\nJPMorgan Chase paid $55 million in January to settle charges that it discriminated against black and Latino borrowers. In 2011, Bank of America handed over $335 million for making its minority customers pay more than its white customers for the same loans. A federal lawsuit against Wells Fargo alleges that the bank has discriminated against Philadelphia\u2019s black and Latino borrowers since 2004.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is an indisputable fact that many banks treat their black customers unequally. The only reason we know this is that banks are required to report demographic data on most mortgage loans. That data is publicly available to anyone who wants to look at it.\n\nAmong other things, the legislation passed by the Senate on Wednesday strips away for some banks the requirement to report the race, ethnicity and gender of their mortgage customers. Under the new proposal, only the largest banks will have to report demographic data, which means that it will be impossible to find out if the other banks discriminate. If the law passes, these banks will be able to deny black customers without fear of repercussion or lawsuits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Democratic Party could have singled out that provision to the public and made a fuss. They could have called it racist (because it is racist), which would have made the legislation lose support. They could easily have refused to vote for this bill unless that specific provision was stripped away.\n\nSen. Doug Jones from the state of Alabama voted for it.\n\nThis is the Democratic Party.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The Democratic Party is only a viable party because of the black vote. In the 2016 election, 88 percent of blacks voted for the Democratic candidate, while only 37 percent of whites voted for Hillary Clinton, according to exit polls by USA Today. Even before the most recent election, according to Pew Research, only 40 percent of whites identified as Democrats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf not for black voters, there would not be a Democratic Party. Without the black vote, Dems would lose every election at the local, state and national levels. The Democratic Party\u2019s leadership knows this. The Republican Party knows this.\n\nYet Democratic politicians repeatedly refuse to stand up for the issues that affect black people the most. They continue to confirm President Donald Trump\u2019s federal court appointees, who will hear cases of police brutality and voter-ID-law discrimination, despite the fact that he has failed to nominate a single African-American or Latino judge to the federal bench.\n\nThey ignored the suggestion that they filibuster every bill until the Senate and House look at gun control legislation to curb the violence that affects black communities disproportionately. They caved on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals vote during the recent government shutdown. (We often forget how immigration laws disproportionately affect African and Caribbean immigrants.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is the solution?\n\nAs usual, all politics is local. Imagine if\u2014at the local level, which affects us the most\u2014black candidates ran on non-Democratic platforms touting issues that are supported by black voters. In Georgia, there might be the \u201cKeisha\u201d Party, which works on stopping freeways from catching on fire and collapsing. Chicago might have a \u201cTop Gang Thugs\u201d Party.\n\nWhat if we supported valid third-party candidates who aren\u2019t beholden to an agenda beholden to Democratic apologists? What if we\u2014even in one single election\u2014wrote in our own choices? What if we stopped participating in this antiquated, binary system of choices?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis would force the national Democratic Party to engage with and pay attention to black voters and black issues. It would also stop Democrat politicians from appearing in black churches and barbershops only during voting season, and pretending that black voters don\u2019t exist in the intervening periods.\n\nOf course, there is the argument that if black voters didn\u2019t support the Democratic Party, Republicans would take over. Answering that question requires me to switch to all caps. Please hold on.\n\nHOW THE HELL ARE WE WINNING NOW?\n\nRepublicans already control 32 state legislatures, 33 governorships, the U.S. Senate, the House of Representatives and the presidency. They are already in control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven with that mostly white, Republican control, the Democratic Party refuses to stand by the side of the people most responsible for the party\u2019s existence. Democratic politicians slither away whenever they are challenged, and compromise at every instance of Republican obstinance (not you, Auntie Maxine; we\u2019re still riding with you).\n\nAnd when it comes to Doug Jones, even though he received 93 percent of the black male vote and a whopping 98 percent of the black female vote, he has not demonstrated that he intends to do anything for black Alabama voters. Jones has supported Trump\u2019s position on 60 percent of the issues since black voters sent him to the Senate.\n\nYet black voters will overwhelmingly vote Democrat in the upcoming midterm elections, after which we will sit back and wait for the Democratic Party to take over both branches of the legislature and begin hearings to impeach Trump and his anti-black agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m betting it will never happen\u2014not because I am a cynic, but because I know history.

The Democratic Party is saying, \u201cI told y\u2019all.\u201d The pundits are giving the entire state of Alabama the credit. Even mainstream media has decided who was most responsible for Doug Jones\u2019 victory over the John Wayne of alleged pedophiles:\n\nYep, according to everyone, \u201cwomen\u201d are the ones who pushed Doug Jones\u2019 campaign for U.S. Senate over the finish line. Not black women. Not even black people. Just women.\n\nBut mostly white women.\n\nAccording to the punditry class, Jones\u2019 victory happened because of all women, including white women. Even though, according to the Washington Post, 63 percent of white women voted for Roy Moore, white women still received credit for the Jones victory. They were the heroes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack women got their shoutouts, and so did black men, but no one dared leave out white women. Although there is no statistical or logical reason to think that white women helped Doug Jones vanquish his opponent, they somehow came down on the right side of history. NBC News whitesplained it this way:\n\nFifty-eight percent of Alabama women voted for the winner, Democrat Doug Jones, including 35 percent of white women, according to exit polling. While that latter figure might not sound like much, it\u2019s more than twice the 16 percent of white Alabama women who voted for President Barack Obama in 2012, the last presidential race in which exit polling was conducted.\n\nWhat. The. Entire. Fuck.\n\nI know some people bristle at the idea that the benefit of whiteness is baked into every molecule of American existence, but the previous paragraph should be included in the dictionary alongside the phrase \u201cwhite privilege.\u201d Imagine taking an exam in front of the entire country, getting 63 percent of the answers wrong and\u2014not only do you pass the test\u2014but you are called to come to the front of the entire class so the professor can pat you on the back!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut wait ... there\u2019s more.\n\nThen there was the venerable political reporter Beth Clayton, who became the mouthpiece of the white-woman savior class. Immediately following the election, Clayton appeared on MSNBC to explain how white women had saved the world. She tied the election to the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment scandal and the #MeToo movement (started by a black woman). She proudly explained to Chris Hayes:\n\nWhen you look at women in across Alabama or in any corner of the United States, we\u2019ve all been in a situation where a man didn\u2019t treat us right, and we know that feeling. And we know how it feels to not be believed. And we showed up and we said, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to tolerate it.\u201d And it helps that, looking across the country, women were beginning to be believed in all corners of America. And they felt confident coming out here in Alabama where, frankly, we frankly don\u2019t have a lot of room to wiggle here. And women came out, and we said, \u201cNo more.\u201d and frankly, no more. We deserve better than this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI doubt she meant it in the way it came off, which is exactly why this Caucaplanation rubbed me the wrong way as soon as I saw it.\n\nWho the hell is \u201cwe\u201d? Clayton must have some black women in her purse, because \u201cwe\u201d didn\u2019t do a damn thing. The vast majority of white \u201cwe\u2019s\u201d voted for the other guy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack people are 26 percent of the population in Alabama, but the Washington Post says they were 29 percent of Tuesday\u2019s electorate. Conversely, whites are 68 percent of Alabama\u2019s population, yet only 66 percent voted in Alabama\u2019s Senate race.\n\nLet\u2019s put it this way: Using AL.com\u2019s raw vote totals and the Washington Post\u2019s exit polls, if all the women in the state assembled themselves and each of Jones\u2019 black female supporters stood beside a white woman who voted for him, there would still be 82,278 black women standing by themselves wondering, \u201cWhere the white women at?\u201d\n\n\n\nNow, explain to me, again, who \u201cshowed up.\u201d\n\nNot white women. That is a fact. Again ... numbers.\n\nWhite women are used to that. They get a privilege no one else in the world enjoys. They get to rail against the white male patriarchy while forgetting the pale crooked fingers that pointed the lynchers in the direction of Emmett Till or the mob that burned down Black Wall Street. They get to decry affirmative action while benefiting from it. They get the front page of Time magazine for changing the country\u2019s attitude about sexual assault while never mentioning the black woman who started the whole thing. They get to scream, \u201cBelieve all women\u201d while simultaneously calling Aurora Perrineau a goddamn liar when she says she was raped by their white friend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe caveat of \u201cFewer white women supported Moore than supported Trump\u201d is a stupid reason to include white women among the reasons for why the molesting equestrian lost his bid for office. Saying that white women helped Moore win is like saying the Golden State Warriors won their first NBA championship because of Festus Ezeli. And I know you\u2019re wondering: \u201cWho the hell is Festus Ezeli? Did he even get in the game?\u201d\n\n\n\nExactly.\n\nYet they are proudly parading around, poking out their chests, proclaiming, \u201cWe did it.\u201d No one is saying white women didn\u2019t contribute. No one would even say they didn\u2019t work hard. They get to share the championship because they were on the team that scored the most points. But they don\u2019t get to act like they\u2019re they most valuable players.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s be clear:\n\nBlack women are the MVPs.\n\nWhite women will tell you that all women are beautiful, delicate creatures who deserve to be protected, appreciated and placed on a pedestal. They say anyone who doesn\u2019t honor all women should be reviled. But they will vote for a pussy grabber. They will cast votes for a child molester.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen they say \u201cMe too,\u201d notice the subtle emphasis on the \u201cme\u201d part. The \u201ctoo\u201d is just to make sure they will be included in the victory celebration. Even when they fail the test. Even if it means kicking the people who did the real work in the ass, they know that they will always have a place on the podium.\n\nEven if they didn\u2019t do shit.", "keywords": ["cant", "nah", "jones", "victory", "know", "washington", "alabama", "didnt", "women", "voted", "black", "white"], "polarity": 0.03457490190499899, "subjectivity": 0.3703524307407801},

But today he released his first full statement after he got his ass whipped by Doug Jones in their head-to-head battle of good vs. evil.\n\nInstead of calling Jones like a real man, Moore released a video to the media. (He said it was for his followers, but Alabama evangelicals don\u2019t watch videos online. That\u2019s how the devil steals your soul. One minute you\u2019re watching YouTube, and the next minute you\u2019re infected with \u201cthe gay\u201d and you\u2019re soliciting sex in an airport bathroom. That\u2019s how they getcha! Larry Craig said so.)\n\nThe video is the absolute craziest piece of white-mannery ever seen. Rarely do we get to see white people laid this bare. (I mean ... I do, because I live in Alabama, but I\u2019m talking about the royal \u201cwe\u201d here.) If you\u2019re like me, it might give you the shivers when you realize how close we were to having this man cast actual votes to determine the policy of our country!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are the top 10 moments from the speech:\n\n10. The subtle touches of white supremacy.\n\nI\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t notice the statue of the Confederate soldier in the background. How do I know it\u2019s a Confederate soldier and not a quick rendering of him riding to the polls on Tuesday? Here\u2019s how I know: Because this is Roy motherfucking Moore!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there\u2019s the Christmas tree in the background for our Lord and Savior, Caucasian Baby Jesus, coupled with Moore\u2019s cross lapel pin, which he sets on fire at the end (not shown in the video). And the whole entire wall is covered by the flag, which is the whitest shit ever. Not that the American flag is white, but they didn\u2019t even iron it! If I went on TV with even a tiny wrinkle, my mother would rise from her grave and beat me to death. And my mother\u2019s not even dead.\n\nBut the wrinkles would have killed her.\n\n9. He opens with a direct shoutout to white nationalists.\n\nHe isn\u2019t even trying to be subtle. It\u2019s as if someone told him to dog-whistle and he yelled: \u201cHey dogs! Come over here!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe are indeed in a struggle to preserve our republic, our civilization and our religion. And to set free a suffering humanity. And the battle rages on ...\u201d is the motto of the \u201calt-right.\u201d OK, I might not be right about that, but it\u2019s at least the first line on the Wikipedia page for white nationalism. It\u2019s probably their pledge of allegiance.\n\nThe belief that America\u2019s foundation of Western civilization is being destroyed by blacks, Mexicans, Muslims and Jews is the basis for the alt-right argument. This is the thesis statement of the white supremacist constitution. (I know what you\u2019re thinking. Yes, it is rife with grammatical errors.) Also, whenever anyone says \u201cand the battle rages on,\u201d they have probably spent the afternoon turning their white bedsheets into a robe.\n\n8. He is lying.\n\nHe states that he is waiting for the provisional and absentee ballots to be counted. Absentee ballots are counted first. There are fewer than 3,000 provisional ballots. He lost by 20,715 votes. Something doesn\u2019t add up. And by \u201csomething,\u201d I mean \u201cnumbers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut again, he\u2019s from Alabama, which ranks 47th in education. So ... math.\n\n7. He shouts out Donald Trump.\n\nMoore says he \u201csaw a window of hope\u201d with the election of Trump. Something about the Founding Fathers and the Constitution. Blah, blah, blah. This is another dog whistle to white people. Whenever they invoke the Founding Fathers, they really mean \u201cwhite people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor white people, the top 10 list of the most important white people goes like this:\n\nBaby Jesus\n\nThe Founding Fathers\n\nGrown-man, ripped-abs, hipster Jesus\n\nRonald Reagan\n\nDead, killed-by-the-Jews Jesus\n\nThe Beatles\n\nThe troops\n\nFrank Sinatra\n\nTheir dog (they consider them people)\n\nWinston Churchill\n\n\n\nIn that order.\n\n6. Then he goes batshit crazy.\n\n\u201cToday we no longer recognize the universal truth that God is the author of our life and liberty. Abortion, sodomy and materialism have taken the place of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,\u201d Moore explains. Then this motherfucker starts preaching!\n\n[W]e have forgotten God. ... We have stopped prayer in schools. We\u2019ve murdered over 60 million of our unborn children. We\u2019ve redefined marriage and destroyed the basis of family, which is the building block of our country. ...

He doesn\u2019t believe that his alleged pedophilia is a problem.\n\nLet\u2019s say that all the women who said Moore tried to holla at them during their 10th-grade study hall period are liars. Moore apparently believes that his molestation charges are relevant to the political process, because he says, \u201cEven our political process has been affected with baseless and false allegations which have become more relevant than the true issues which affect our country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait ... what? Sexual assault and pedophila are not \u201ctrue issues\u201d? According to him, the gay and trans thing affects us all more than a grown man trolling the middle school parking lot trying to take our daughters behind the dumpster for a makeout session.\n\n4. He says that money from \u201coutside groups\u201d turned the election.\n\nHe didn\u2019t say that when alt-right whisperer Steve Bannon endorsed him. He didn\u2019t mention this when Trump rallied for him. Or when the Republican National Committee sent him money. It\u2019s the \u201coutsiders\u201d who tainted the election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI guess the 671,151 Alabamians who went to the polls and said \u201cnot you\u201d were all outsiders. Gotcha.\n\n3. Then it got crazier.\n\nAgain he says: \u201c[A]nd the battle rages on. Together we must stand against those who would take from us our country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur country.\u201d Who is \u201cour\u201d? He already told you that it\u2019s not the gays. Not the transgender. He specifically notes that America doesn\u2019t belong to the Muslims because they don\u2019t believe in \u201cour religion.\u201d\n\n2. Wait ... what?\n\nDid you notice anything missing? Does this concession video seem to be lacking anything? Let me give you a hint:\n\nHe. Does. Not. Concede.\n\nHe never says \u201cThe people of Alabama have spoken\u201d or admit that he was defeated. He doesn\u2019t even mention Doug Jones\u2019 name. There\u2019s another element that he forgot to include in his speech. It may be a small, trivial bit of information, but I think it is at least a tiny bit relevant to the situation:\n\nThe other guy got more votes.\n\n1. The last part.\n\nWhen Moore starts quoting the Bible, the video stops being crazy and starts getting a little bit frightening. I am not afraid of white people, but I am afraid of these kinds of white people. He goes on a school-shooter, religious-fundamentalist-extremist, let-me-say-something-before-I-ignite-the-explosives-packed-in-my-vest rant:\n\nIn the words of the holy Scriptures: \u201cWe wrestle not against flesh and blood but against prinicipalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand an evil day, and having done all\u2014to stand.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?\n\nDid that scare you as much as it scared me? I am not simply disturbed by his insane pomposity, the fervor in which he quotes the Scriptures or the genuine earnestness in his eyes. But the fact that 650,000 people in Alabama heard him do this all year and believed it is disconcerting on an I\u2019m-black-living-in-a-state-where-most-white-people-voted-for-this-guy level. It is truly indicative of Moore\u2019s dumb, white ... what\u2019s the opposite of \u201cHotep\u201d?\n\nI would call him evil, but instead, I will quote another Scripture:\n\nAnd Jesus answered and said unto them, \u201cTake heed that no man deceive you.

Even with his problematic campaign, he was one of the good ones. He would remember what black voters did for him. How could he not recognize that the only reason he is now referred to as \u201cSen. Doug Jones from the state of Alabama\u201d is the black vote? After all, he\u2019s a Democrat. How could he forget who put him there?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn return, Doug Jones and the Democratic Party, once again, have thrown black people to the wolves.\n\nPolitico magazine reports that on Wednesday, the Senate passed a bank-deregulation bill that rolls back many of the regulations imposed on banks and lenders. The bill passed with the support of the Trump administration, Republican senators and 17 Democratic senators\u2014most of whom are considered to be moderate or conservative Dems. The legislation now moves to the House of Representatives, where it is expected to pass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more than a decade I have been trying to push the idea that blackness has evolved past its murky racial and cultural definition. As a college macroeconomics instructor, I taught a class, Race as an Economic Construct, that advocated examining race through the lens of data and numbers. (The science of economics is not limited to the production and distribution of goods, services and wealth.)\n\nOne of the easiest ways to illustrate this point is with the history of black homeownership. Homeownership is the biggest builder of wealth in America and is still affected by the history of segregation, Jim Crow and redlining. It fuels every indicator of discrimination in this country and is one of the best examples of the manifestation of white supremacy.\n\nHousing discrimination relegated African Americans to homogeneous, poor black communities with underfunded, segregated schools. Poorer schools create the education gap. The education gap creates employment disparities. Underemployment creates poverty and the phenomenon called \u201cblack-on-black crime.\u201d Poverty leads to the inability to acquire affordable housing, which relegates black people to low-income communities, which leads to underfunded schools, which leads to more crime and so on. It is a vicious circle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is all about homeownership.\n\nWe have always known this. The Root has routinely reported on the difficulties black people encounter when buying a home. A recent report by the Center for Investigative Reporting, along with Reveal News, uncovered how U.S. banks systematically prevent blacks and Hispanics from becoming homeowners.\n\nJPMorgan Chase paid $55 million in January to settle charges that it discriminated against black and Latino borrowers. In 2011, Bank of America handed over $335 million for making its minority customers pay more than its white customers for the same loans. A federal lawsuit against Wells Fargo alleges that the bank has discriminated against Philadelphia\u2019s black and Latino borrowers since 2004.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is an indisputable fact that many banks treat their black customers unequally. The only reason we know this is that banks are required to report demographic data on most mortgage loans. That data is publicly available to anyone who wants to look at it.\n\nAmong other things, the legislation passed by the Senate on Wednesday strips away for some banks the requirement to report the race, ethnicity and gender of their mortgage customers. Under the new proposal, only the largest banks will have to report demographic data, which means that it will be impossible to find out if the other banks discriminate. If the law passes, these banks will be able to deny black customers without fear of repercussion or lawsuits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Democratic Party could have singled out that provision to the public and made a fuss. They could have called it racist (because it is racist), which would have made the legislation lose support. They could easily have refused to vote for this bill unless that specific provision was stripped away.\n\nSen. Doug Jones from the state of Alabama voted for it.\n\nThis is the Democratic Party.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The Democratic Party is only a viable party because of the black vote. In the 2016 election, 88 percent of blacks voted for the Democratic candidate, while only 37 percent of whites voted for Hillary Clinton, according to exit polls by USA Today. Even before the most recent election, according to Pew Research, only 40 percent of whites identified as Democrats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf not for black voters, there would not be a Democratic Party. Without the black vote, Dems would lose every election at the local, state and national levels. The Democratic Party\u2019s leadership knows this. The Republican Party knows this.\n\nYet Democratic politicians repeatedly refuse to stand up for the issues that affect black people the most. They continue to confirm President Donald Trump\u2019s federal court appointees, who will hear cases of police brutality and voter-ID-law discrimination, despite the fact that he has failed to nominate a single African-American or Latino judge to the federal bench.\n\nThey ignored the suggestion that they filibuster every bill until the Senate and House look at gun control legislation to curb the violence that affects black communities disproportionately. They caved on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals vote during the recent government shutdown. (We often forget how immigration laws disproportionately affect African and Caribbean immigrants.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is the solution?\n\nAs usual, all politics is local. Imagine if\u2014at the local level, which affects us the most\u2014black candidates ran on non-Democratic platforms touting issues that are supported by black voters. In Georgia, there might be the \u201cKeisha\u201d Party, which works on stopping freeways from catching on fire and collapsing. Chicago might have a \u201cTop Gang Thugs\u201d Party.\n\nWhat if we supported valid third-party candidates who aren\u2019t beholden to an agenda beholden to Democratic apologists? What if we\u2014even in one single election\u2014wrote in our own choices? What if we stopped participating in this antiquated, binary system of choices?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis would force the national Democratic Party to engage with and pay attention to black voters and black issues. It would also stop Democrat politicians from appearing in black churches and barbershops only during voting season, and pretending that black voters don\u2019t exist in the intervening periods.\n\nOf course, there is the argument that if black voters didn\u2019t support the Democratic Party, Republicans would take over. Answering that question requires me to switch to all caps. Please hold on.\n\nHOW THE HELL ARE WE WINNING NOW?\n\nRepublicans already control 32 state legislatures, 33 governorships, the U.S. Senate, the House of Representatives and the presidency. They are already in control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven with that mostly white, Republican control, the Democratic Party refuses to stand by the side of the people most responsible for the party\u2019s existence. Democratic politicians slither away whenever they are challenged, and compromise at every instance of Republican obstinance (not you, Auntie Maxine; we\u2019re still riding with you).\n\nAnd when it comes to Doug Jones, even though he received 93 percent of the black male vote and a whopping 98 percent of the black female vote, he has not demonstrated that he intends to do anything for black Alabama voters. Jones has supported Trump\u2019s position on 60 percent of the issues since black voters sent him to the Senate.\n\nYet black voters will overwhelmingly vote Democrat in the upcoming midterm elections, after which we will sit back and wait for the Democratic Party to take over both branches of the legislature and begin hearings to impeach Trump and his anti-black agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m betting it will never happen\u2014not because I am a cynic, but because I know history. I am exhausted from being punished for the good deeds of black people. I have learned what happens when I place my trust in Democrats or good white men.\n\nMy grandmother taught me that.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This post has been updated to clarify that the largest banks will still be required to report their demographic data.", "keywords": ["party", "banks", "jones", "doug", "vote", "senate", "voters", "report", "black", "white", "screwed", "democratic"], "polarity": 0.04582119900301719, "subjectivity": 0.43329168306440996},

Flores was speaking about her choice to have an abortion at age 16. How she didn\u2019t want to experience the hardship of her \u201csix other sisters,\u201d who all \u201cbecame pregnant in their teens.\u201d\n\n\n\nFlores\u2019 unapologetic recounting of her own abortion while defending a sex education bill on the assembly floor shot her to national fame. Her life experience\u2014growing up poor as one of 13 children to Mexican immigrant parents, dropping out of high school, going to jail, and eventually getting her law degree\u2014informed her commitment to fighting for reproductive rights and low-income women. It also made her the perfect face to spread the message of pro-choice political advocacy group EMILY\u2019s List.\n\nIn 2014, when Flores ran for the state\u2019s lieutenant governor seat, she was nominated to be a Rising Star of the year. Every year, EMILY\u2019s List Rising Stars program highlights a group of candidates on their website, many of them women of color, who are nominees people can \u201cvote\u201d for by entering in their email address. The point is to raise candidates\u2019 profiles and help EMILY\u2019s List by building out their email lists.\n\nAs a Rising Star, Flores flew around the country, from San Francisco to Chicago to Texas, taking time out of her own campaign to tell her life story to EMILY\u2019s List donors. \u201cI was good on the stump and had an inspiring story,\u201d Flores explained. \u201cI was someone that could get their donors excited.\u201d\n\nThere was just one problem: Flores rarely got to meet those donors, despite asking EMILY\u2019s List for help. At the events she spoke at, Flores recalled that \u201cmost of the time I couldn\u2019t get them to set up a single meeting, and if they did, I was lucky to get maybe one or two.\u201d For Flores, it felt like her story was being \u201cleveraged\u201d to boost EMILY\u2019s List, for which she got little in return. \u201cThey never did any specific fundraising for me,\u201d she said, at the panels or retreats they sent her to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe message was clear: It was about which candidate could raise more money.\n\nFlores lost that race, but went on to run for Nevada\u2019s 4th congressional seat in 2016. EMILY\u2019s List, which had endorsed Flores three times previously, decided to instead back her challenger, Susie Lee, a wealthy, white philanthropist who had never held office before. The move raised eyebrows in the national news. Many of Flores\u2019 supporters accused EMILY\u2019s List\u2019s move as payback for Flores\u2019 endorsement of Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primary.\n\nEMILY\u2019s List categorically denied this accusation, and declined to comment publicly on Flores\u2019 experience to Splinter. But the reason that Lucinda Guinn, EMILY\u2019s List vice president of campaigns, gave to a Flores supporter in an email obtained by the Las Vegas Review-Journal was perhaps more telling of the group\u2019s priorities: \u201cSusie is clearly the strongest candidate in this race\u2014she currently has over half a million dollars more in her campaign account than Lucy, who hasn\u2019t built an operation capable of communicating with voters this time around.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe message was clear: It was about which candidate could raise more money.\n\nIn the end, neither woman came up victorious. Despite backing from EMILY\u2019s List, Lee still ended up in third in the primary behind Flores, who came in second to then-state senator Ruben Kihuen.\n\n\n\nEMILY\u2019s List was founded in 1985 by Ellen Malcolm, an heiress to a vast IBM fortune. Its story is one of the hallowed tales of the Beltway: One winter morning, Malcolm brought together a group of women and asked, \u201cAll right, what do we have to do to finally elect a Democratic woman to the Senate?\u201d According to the Washington Post, every woman there had the same answer: getting women money early in their campaigns so they could establish their viability.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThus, the political action committee whose name stands for Early Money Is Like Yeast (\u201cit makes the dough rise\u201d) was born. It had the singular goal of getting Democratic pro-choice women in office.\n\nAt the time of its founding, a Democratic woman had never been elected to the Senate without previously filling in an unexpired seat. A year later, Barbara Mikulski broke that glass ceiling and she gave EMILY\u2019s List, which raised 20 percent of everything Mikulski brought in during her first reporting period, a large part of the credit for her success. \u201cEMILY\u2019s List was absolutely crucial to my campaign,\u201d Mikulski told the Post at the time.\n\nSince then, EMILY\u2019s List has become a behemoth organization within the Democratic Party. It has played a big part in changing the political landscape for women over the past three decades. In the 2016 election cycle, the group raised a record $90 million. As the largest national resource for women in politics, securing EMILY\u2019s List backing is an essential boost for for many women running for office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you waste $100,000 on someone who will lose, that\u2019s $100,000 you don\u2019t have to spend on other women.\u201d\n\nThe group \u201chelped provide validity to this idea that a woman running for office is not a weakness,\u201d William Cubbison, a former political operative who worked at Lillian\u2019s List, a North Carolina organization modeled after EMILY\u2019s List, told me. \u201cThey spent a lot of time and effort building this idea that women have something unique to add to the political conversation,\u201d he said, \u201cand women have a responsibility to put in time and money to elect other women.\u201d\n\nYet despite incremental gains over the past decade, the number of women at all levels of government has plateaued at around 20 percent. When it comes to female representation in the legislature, the U.S. ranks 99th in the world. In the last two election cycles, EMILY\u2019s List came out with a poor showing\u2014in 2016, the group had a 40 percent win rate according to OpenSecrets.org, a website that tracks money in politics. In 2014, a notoriously bad year for Democrats, the group only won a quarter of the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt would be unfair to single out EMILY\u2019s List for these losses; the Democratic Party itself has been decimated in every level of government over the past decade. And in the year since the 2016 election, the party in general\u2014which desperately needs to mobilize and motivate a younger and more diverse electorate\u2014has proven to be slow to catch up to the changing political dynamics of the country.\n\nBut with the surge of women signing up to run after Donald Trump\u2019s election, it\u2019s worth evaluating EMILY\u2019s strategies and asking whether or not the organization is staying true to its original mission.\n\nFor women like Flores, the answer is a firm no. \u201cThey go through this entire dog and pony show about their humble beginnings and yet they will turn around and say you\u2019re not raising enough money, we\u2019re going to go ahead and pass,\u201d Flores said. It was, in her eyes, antithetical to EMILY\u2019s List own professed origin story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlores\u2019 experience was one of the more egregious cases of qualified women appearing to be passed over by EMILY\u2019s List, but her story is not the only one. A recent Intercept piece detailed how progressive candidates across the country are finding it difficult to gain the support of the Democratic Party infrastructure, an infrastructure that often includes EMILY\u2019s List.\n\nTake Jess King, a candidate vying for the Democratic nomination to face off against Republican Lloyd Smucker in what was formerly Pennsylvania\u2019s 16th district. (The district was one of the few that became more red in the recent redrawing of the state\u2019s new congressional map.) King, who is running a populist campaign with the support of many local grassroots groups, reached out to EMILY\u2019s List multiple times but, aside from the group sending King a questionnaire form which she filled out, did not hear back.\n\nInstead, EMILY\u2019s List aligned with the rest of the Democratic establishment by endorsing mainstream Democrat Christina Hartman, who had ran and lost to Smucker in 2016. (Because of the new maps, Hartman dropped out of the race this week and moved to the 10th district.) Guido Girgenti, King\u2019s spokesperson, told the Intercept that EMILY\u2019s list did not even extend a courtesy call.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEMILY\u2019s List sees candidates as disposable commodities.\u201d\n\n\u201cMillions of women are struggling to make ends meet, working minimum-wage jobs and stretching every dollar for their kids,\u201d King told me over email. \u201cIf we care about working moms like me, we need to fight for policies like Medicare-for-all, universal childcare, and debt-free college. I hope EMILY\u2019s List will also consider candidates\u2019 positions on those issues when endorsing in the future.\u201d\n\nCandidates like King, who outraised her EMILY\u2019s List-backed opponent in the fourth quarter through small-dollar donations, have shown that traditional avenues of raising money, such as being a self-funder, are no longer the only way to go. And then there are the times when more money doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into victories, like when Lee had more cash on hand in 2016 but still finished behind Flores.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I asked Alexandra De Luca, a spokesperson for EMILY\u2019s List, about their decision not to back King, she said the surge in the number of women running is \u201ca good problem for us to have. It\u2019s often that there is more than one awesome pro-choice Democratic women in a race. We take these races on a case-by-case basis.\u201d In response to whether or not the group over-emphasizes fundraising when endorsing, De Luca said, \u201cwe look for candidates who have a path to victory who are going to put in the work.\u201d But, she added, \u201cfundraising is an important part of a campaign.\u201d\n\nOf course, money is important and tough decisions have to be made with limited resources. As Cubbison put it, \u201cIf you waste $100,000 on someone who will lose, that\u2019s $100,000 you don\u2019t have to spend on other women.\u201d But the money-as-viability model can be particularly damaging for women who start out with fewer political and financial connections, which often means women of color, low-income women, and those living in rural areas.\n\n\u201cEMILY\u2019s List has been similar to a lot of other D.C. organizations, where they want to back people who can win,\u201d Cubbison said. It\u2019s a \u201cvicious circle\u201d that especially affects women of color: \u201cThey are not perceived as viable, so no one supports them, but they are not viable because no one\u2019s supporting them.\u201d (On their endorsement page, EMILY\u2019s List has backed 59 candidates running for a Congressional or gubernatorial seat, a large majority of whom are white. Only two, Stacey Abrams and Lauren Underwood, are black women.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKimberly Peeler-Allen, co-founder of Higher Heights, the only organization exclusively dedicated to increasing black women\u2019s political engagement, told me over email that fundraising remains a big obstacle. \u201cBlack women often run in districts that do not have the resources to support their candidacy, so they must raise money outside the district,\u201d Peeler-Allen wrote. \u201cA candidate\u2019s viability cannot be determined solely on the total dollars raised. Many black women have run and won when they have been outraised by their competitors, because they had the operation and message that was most compelling to move voters to the polls.\u201d\n\nHigher Heights, which was founded in 2011, partners with EMILY\u2019s List to ensure that all black women coming through their doors \u201care supported in a holistic manner.\u201d\n\nEMILY\u2019s List often responds to criticism that they support mainly white, wealthy candidates by pointing out that 40 percent of the women the group has helped to elect on the federal level are women of color. And the Intercept\u2019s evaluation of current primary races found that while the main variable to party support was fundraising, \u201cestablishment Democrats of today are just as willing\u2014or perhaps more so\u2014to back a lesbian woman of color as they are a straight, white man, and the same is true on the left.\u201d De Luca pointed to the group\u2019s endorsements of diverse candidates like Abrams who is running for Georgia\u2019s governor\u2019s seat and Veronica Escobar, who is running in Texas\u2019s 16th district.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, as in the case of Flores, it matters how some of those women are treated after they\u2019re endorsed. \u201cMy experience is really just a demonstration of how EMILY\u2019s list sees candidates,\u201d Flores said. \u201cThey see them as disposable commodities. The purpose in that commodity is to raise them money and raise their stature. Once you are no longer serving those two purposes, you are disposable to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cEMILY\u2019s List gave me some consultants to hire. But I\u2019m a public school teacher. I can\u2019t afford to hire anybody.\u201d\n\nFlores\u2019 experience raised eyebrows with women of color. Felicia Ortiz, who serves on the Nevada State Board of Education, told me EMILY\u2019s List had recently called her up to ask for a contribution. She had supported them in the past, but after seeing what happened to Flores, Ortiz declined. \u201cIt left a bad taste in my mouth,\u201d Ortiz told me. \u201cWith everything that\u2019s going on [after Donald\u2019s Trump\u2019s election], I decided to use my money more wisely.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe pointed out the large Hispanic population in her state. \u201cI don\u2019t see organizations like EMILY\u2019s List supporting candidates that are going to truly represent our communities.\u201d\n\nEMILY\u2019s List often works in lockstep with the greater Democratic establishment. And the party has shown that it can be stubbornly slow to change. (Many sources seemed hesitant to publicly criticize EMILY\u2019s List, given how large they loom in Democratic politics.) Critics on the left believe that part of the reason for this boils down to the ecosystem of consultants benefiting from the fundraising-first model.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne Democratic operative pointed out that Jonathan Parker, former campaign director at EMILY\u2019s List, was married to Tierney Hunt, a founder of the consulting firm New Media Firm, Inc. \u201cNew Media Firm was making tons of money on media buys because EMILY\u2019s List more than often gave her the contract,\u201d this operative, who asked to stay anonymous because of risks to their job, told me. \u201cThis stymies creativity and stymies consultants who are willing to take a risk.\u201d\n\nKaren Mallard, a public school teacher who was inspired to run as a first-time candidate for a Congressional seat in Virginia\u2019s 2nd district after Trump\u2019s election, told the Intercept that she had met with someone at EMILY\u2019s List in D.C., who promised to introduce her to people at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. But the Democratic Party decided instead to concentrate on two male candidates successively (who each dropped out) before recruiting a third candidate, Navy veteran Elaine Luria. (Luria twice voted for Scott Taylor, the GOP representative she would be challenging, which her campaign manager told the Richmond Times-Dispatch was because \u201cElaine doesn\u2019t make decisions just based on political party.\u201d)\n\n\u201cEMILY\u2019s List gave me some consultants to hire,\u201d Mallard told the Intercept. \u201cBut I\u2019m a public school teacher. I can\u2019t afford to hire anybody.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe relationships between organizations like EMILY\u2019s List and their preferred consultants is certainly nothing new, but they don\u2019t look great for a party that needs to shake the image of establishment grift. (The DCCC recently made the extraordinary move of releasing opposition research attacking Laura Moser\u2014a fellow Democratic activist candidate who is running against EMILY\u2019s List-backed Lizzie Pannill Fletcher\u2014for spending campaign money on her husband\u2019s consulting firm, despite the fact that the DCCC and EMILY\u2019s List regularly partake in the same practice.)\n\nThe question is whether or not EMILY\u2019s List\u2019s parameters are too broad to effectively harness the progressive energy in 2018.\n\nNot to mention that a federal PAC taking over a race can often override a candidates\u2019 local knowledge and expertise. Flores spoke about how EMILY\u2019s List gave her a list of consultants to hire during her lieutenant governor\u2019s race, which she felt pressured to use. \u201cWhen they endorse you, it\u2019s very clear that you will not only disclose most of your campaign info to them, but you\u2019re also going to use the consultants that they assign you.\u201d Flores said that because of the close ties between EMILY\u2019s List and the Democratic Party in her state, she didn\u2019t really have a choice in the matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn Nevada, if I did not do as EMILY\u2019s List told me,\u201d that affected \u201csupport I was getting within Democratic Party. It\u2019s all connected.\u201d\n\nIn essence, EMILY\u2019s List plays it safe. While getting any pro-choice women elected might have been a radical bet in 1985, now\u2014in large part due to EMILY\u2019s List\u2014that tide has shifted. But with so many pro-choice women running for office, the unspoken ideological factors that go into the group\u2019s endorsement process are becoming clearer.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe question, then, is whether or not EMILY\u2019s List\u2019s parameters are too broad to effectively harness progressive energy in 2018. Take reproductive rights, EMILY\u2019s List\u2019s signature issue. The concept of a pro-choice candidate cannot be evaluated on that criterion alone, since the issue of reproductive justice is so tightly interwoven with racial and economic justice. True freedom of choice means having the capacity to raise\u2014or not raise\u2014a child with dignity and basic material support.\n\nThis means a party that doesn\u2019t have a knee-jerk reaction against candidates who support a slew of full-throated social programs. As Katie McDonough wrote in Splinter, \u201cThe extreme right has managed to learn a lesson about reproductive freedom that the Democratic Party still hasn\u2019t grasped: It\u2019s bigger than just the clinic, bigger than the Supreme Court.\u201d In the face of Trump\u2019s administration, which has passed a radically regressive tax bill, is looking to slash welfare programs, and whose ICE agents are terrorizing immigrants on a daily basis, EMILY\u2019s List\u2019s litmus tests\u2014that a candidate must only be female, Democratic, and pro-choice\u2014seem more and more insufficient.\n\nAnd the recent wave of female first-time candidates and challengers to incumbents, at every level of government, means that it might be time for all establishment organizations to start rethinking their strategy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDe Luca pointed out that EMILY\u2019s List has tripled the size of their state and local team and expanded their digital program, which included launching a series of webinars to help reach women in more rural areas. But much of this still seems like they are leading from behind\u2014and as their pattern of recent endorsements has shown, the group hasn\u2019t really shaken up its recipe.\n\n\u201cIf we want to seize tens of thousands of women signing up for office, we have to start going outside of traditional political strategies of the past,\u201d said Erin Vilardi, founder of VoteRunLead, an organization that focuses on training women to run for state and local races. \u201cThat includes doubling down on women of color, and maybe not looking so strongly at incumbents.\u201d\n\nVilardi started VoteRunLead in 2003 as part of the now-shuttered White House Project, a non-profit organization focused on increasing female representation, because she found there was a void in resources for training women at the local and state level, especially for women of color and those in rural areas. According to Vilardi, VoteRunLead trained more women than any other group last year, 3,200 in live classes and 6,500 in recorded ones, 60 percent of who were women of color. Since November 2017, 70 percent of women trained by VoteRunLead running for the first time won their races (the usual win rate for newcomers is 10 percent).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been stuck at 20 percent female representation,\u201d Vilardi says. \u201cWe have to try for a recipe that calls for more than federal PAC money.\u201d\n\nMuch of the recent energy of women signing up to run is driven, as New York magazine\u2019s Rebecca Traister puts it, by the alluring idea of replacement. This means the replacement, yes, of Donald Trump and his kleptocratic cabal of wealthy white men, but also of men in every party and at every level of government.\n\nBut true replacement cannot be built around the disgust of one man, or even most men. For women to reach political, racial, and economic parity, it will also mean changing the political infrastructure that has gotten us to where we are today, including within the Democratic Party. EMILY\u2019s List, for better or for worse, has become one of the pillars of that infrastructure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEMILY\u2019s List was always intended to be an organization that changes the status quo\u2014the fact that the Democratic Party willingly embraces pro-choice female candidates today is a testament to that work. Yet as we sit at the cusp of what could be a historic year for women, the organization seems to be relying on the same old playbook.", "keywords": ["party", "told", "political", "flores", "lost", "emilys", "list", "women", "money", "way", "candidates", "democratic"], "polarity": 0.11738926586677459, "subjectivity": 0.39798384333851483},

On Tuesday the Alabama Senate race took place. Roy Moore, a repugnant alleged serial child molester who believes that women should not have the right to vote, civil rights should be scrapped and slavery was lit, lost by a hair. Doug Jones, Moore\u2019s opponent, was carried to victory by black folks\u2014specifically black women. Exit polls showed that 98 percent of black women voted for Jones, as compared with 93 percent of black men, 35 percent of white women and 27 percent of white men.\n\n\n\nListen closely. Do you hear it? That, my friend, is the sound of hundreds upon thousands of black women letting out a resounding \u201cWe tried to tell y\u2019all.\u201d\n\nEvery time there is something good in this world\u2014know that black women probably did it first, said it first, seent it first. Someone was so sure about this that they put it on a T-shirt. Conversely, most negative things in this world, black women tried to save you from.\n\nIt was Anita Hill who exposed the predatory nature of men on Capitol Hill, long before Monica Lewinsky\u2019s heels ever stepped on the carpets of the Oval Office. It was Tarana Burke who sent the first #MeToo into the world, 10 years before the movement was appropriated by white feminism. Twenty years prior to the pink pussy hats that filled the streets of our nation\u2019s capital, 750,000 black women gathered for their Million Woman March.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, black women were the only demographic that vehemently opposed the election of Donald Trump, and exemplified that in their votes. And 94 percent of black women voted for Hillary Clinton\u201412 more percentage points than black men and over 20 more percentage points than the Latina and Latino population. It is unclear why J. Cole\u2019s \u201cNo Role Modelz\u201d isn\u2019t consistently at the top of the charts\u2014because clearly, this nation don\u2019t wanna be saved.\n\nTrump\u2019s slogan betrays him because it belongs to black women. We have been trying to make America great from the jump. So much nonsense could be avoided if this nation listened to us. There is something unique about black women. Like our male counterparts, we built this nation. However, black women also raised it. We nursed and bathed its children\u2014both black and white\u2014fed its workforce and cleaned its households. We know more about black men, white men and white women than they know about themselves. Therefore, we are in a special position to predict the unknown, advise the unknowledgeable and reshape the unseen future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt would seem that these traits would make America treasure us, holding us up as a pinnacle of wisdom. Instead, as Malcolm X said:\n\nThe most disrespected person in America is the black woman. The most unprotected person in America is the black woman. The most neglected person in America is the black woman.\n\nAnd that\u2019s on a good day. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nThe most disrespected person in America is the black woman.\n\nAs black women, policed by Eurocentric beauty standards, we are routinely attacked for our appearances. Michelle Obama, Rep. Maxine Waters and Leslie Jones are just a few examples of black women whom the internet and media have dragged for filth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur spirited personalities are denounced as inappropriately dominant. Our strong leadership is constantly reduced to words like \u201ccontrolling\u201d and \u201cpushy,\u201d rather than being seen for what it is: dynamic.\n\nSojourner Truth, in her \u201cAin\u2019t I a Woman\u201d speech, conveyed that society claims that women are to be coddled, put on a pedestal and given the best treatment that society has to offer, but no one ever does that for black women. In fact, when it is done for black women, it\u2019s \u201ccorny\u201d\u2014what people call Russell Wilson\u2019s excellent treatment of Ciara. Aren\u2019t we women, too? Do we not deserve to be cherished?\n\n\n\nThe most unprotected person in America is the black woman.\n\nSince slavery, the black woman has been unprotected. We bore whips and savage rape from white slave masters. Our children were ripped away from us and sold as property. We became the targets of forced sterilization, the government\u2019s horrific plan for population control. Our households\u2019 resources waned under the strain of the systemic underemployment and mass incarceration of black men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresently, our own community has the audacity to continue this heinous legacy. Sixty percent of black girls experience sexual abuse at the hands of black men before the age of 18. Yet these perpetrators rarely face consequences, because black women instinctively protect black men from white supremacy and imprisonment. Intimate-partner violence is the leading cause of death for black women. Yet these victims are rarely depicted as innocent but, rather, as emasculating, domineering, mouthy instigators.\n\nWe are even punished if we try to protect ourselves, like Marissa Alexander, who received 20 years in prison for firing a warning shot into the air to ward off her violent ex-spouse, or Cyntoia Brown, who is serving a life sentence for shooting a man who purchased her for sex from a sex trafficking ring when she was 16.\n\nBlack Women in Alabama Saved Themselves Last Night If you\u2019ve kept up with how black women roll in American politics, what happened in Alabama last\u2026 Read more Read\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most neglected person in America is the black woman.\n\nBlack women are often erased from movements we create and/or prop up. Why is it that we can rattle off facts about Malcolm, Martin and Medgar, but rarely hear about the women of the civil rights movement? It was Amelia Boynton who wrote to Martin Luther King Jr., convincing him to come to Selma, Ala., yet there is no mention of her in most movies and textbooks. It was Autherine Lucy Foster who suggested laying Jimmie Lee Jackson\u2019s body on the steps of the Alabama state Capitol, but the idea is often credited to James Bevel. Men may have been the faces of this movement, but women were the strategists.\n\nAfter the 2016 presidential election, white women rushed to adorn Susan B. Anthony\u2019s grave with \u201cI Voted\u201d stickers, but where were the stickers for Shirley Chisholm, Fannie Lou Hamer, Sojourner Truth, Ida B. Wells and Mary Church Terrell\u2014who fought for women\u2019s right to vote even when the racist suffrage movement left them out?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is mirrored today. The Black Lives Matter movement, founded by three black women, is often tied to DeRay Mckesson and Shaun King. #MeToo was founded by Tarana Burke, a black woman, yet its appropriation by white women leaves people out who look like its very founder. White utterances of #MeToo have stripped some of the most notorious men of their power and influence, yet when Lupita Nyong\u2019o and Aurora Perrineau came forward, they were swiftly decried as liars. Black women must alway work twice as hard to get half as far and hope that no one falsely claims even that small victory for themselves.\n\nMaya Pope described America\u2019s relationship with black women best in Scandal\u2019s season 6 finale:\n\nI tell you \u2026 being a black woman. \u201cBe strong,\u201d they say. Support your men. Raise a man. Think like a man. Well, damn. I gotta do all that? Who\u2019s out here working for me? Carrying my burden? Building me up when I get down? Nobody. Black women out here trying to save everybody. We still try. Try to help all y\u2019all, even when we get nothing. God forbid you let a sista like me help you out. No, you don\u2019t want that. Don\u2019t let me put you on my back when you fall, wipe the crust out of your eye, put a pep back in your step. Because when we do, you resent us for making you better, smarter, stronger; then drop us so you can be with someone basic. Someone without all that baggage you left us with. But we still try.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nW.E.B. Du Bois once said that on judgment day, he would forgive slavery, but what he could never forgive was the \u201cpersistent insulting of black womanhood.\u201d And neither can I.

It happens so often that it is impossible to ignore, but this most recent case might be the worst because they ran from a fight they could have won. It should be obvious to anyone with a hint of melanin in their skin that the Democratic Party is not our friend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery day for an entire month, they looked us in the eyes and told their constituents how they were going to resist the ethnic-cleansing-lite policy of the Republican Party. \u201cNot a dime until we renew the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals,\u201d they said. \u201cWe\u2019ll shut it down if they don\u2019t agree,\u201d they told us. If Congress funded the government, Dems promised that the GOP would have to do it without a single Democratic vote.\n\nThey were lying the whole time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: A lie is a lie whether it is preplanned or not. If I promise to give you a dollar tomorrow, it does not matter what transpires in the meantime. If I don\u2019t hand you four quarters, I lied.\n\nThe reason for the Democratic Party\u2019s betrayal does not matter. Whether they caved because of the mounting prospect of the shutdown being renamed the \u201cSchumer Shutdown,\u201d or because they were bluffing from the beginning, is inconsequential. No one cares why they lied, only that they are habitual liars.\n\n\u201cBut the Childhood Health Insurance Plan ... ,\u201d they will tell you. Republicans were already unanimously in favor of CHIP.

How can you stand in front of black, Hispanic and Muslim voters for a year telling them how the Republicans were lying, xenophobic racists, and then turn around and explain to those same voters how you acquiesced because they promised you that they would perhaps think about considering the possibility of allowing a vote on something they vehemently hate?\n\nThe Democratic Party is better than the Republican Party in the way that manslaughter is slightly better than murder: It might seem like a lesser crime, but the victim can\u2019t really tell the difference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemocrats are the minority party.

(OK, I admit that the entire world probably doesn\u2019t watch CSPAN, but still ... )\n\nBut this is how the Democratic Party operates. It is impossible to say whether they remain perpetual losers because of a lack of a plan or because they don\u2019t give a fuck about their nonwhite constituents, but it is telling that their losses somehow always end up costing black and brown people.

They are always willing to ride. They are never willing to die.\n\nThey will suck down Champagne in the VIP section of the club like the Dems did after the special election for Alabama\u2019s Senate seat. White women were shaking their titties, taking shots of Patr\u00f3n, screaming, \u201cWe did it,\u201d balling out like they were in a P.

They still haven\u2019t addressed the Supreme Court\u2019s dismantling of the Voting Rights Act. They haven\u2019t used their clout to direct federal dollars to underfunded schools. They disregard HBCUs. They run from affirmative action. They dodge any mention of reparations.\n\nAnd none of this is to say that the Dems\u2019 duplicity is the fault of the Democratic Party or white people. It is the fault of black people. We have empowered them. No Democrat could win a local, state or national election without the black vote. It is black voters\u2019 fault that we don\u2019t demand anything in return but lip service and bumper stickers.

It happens so often that it is impossible to ignore, but this most recent case might be the worst because they ran from a fight they could have won. It should be obvious to anyone with a hint of melanin in their skin that the Democratic Party is not our friend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery day for an entire month, they looked us in the eyes and told their constituents how they were going to resist the ethnic-cleansing-lite policy of the Republican Party. \u201cNot a dime until we renew the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals,\u201d they said. \u201cWe\u2019ll shut it down if they don\u2019t agree,\u201d they told us. If Congress funded the government, Dems promised that the GOP would have to do it without a single Democratic vote.\n\nThey were lying the whole time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: A lie is a lie whether it is preplanned or not. If I promise to give you a dollar tomorrow, it does not matter what transpires in the meantime. If I don\u2019t hand you four quarters, I lied.\n\nThe reason for the Democratic Party\u2019s betrayal does not matter. Whether they caved because of the mounting prospect of the shutdown being renamed the \u201cSchumer Shutdown,\u201d or because they were bluffing from the beginning, is inconsequential. No one cares why they lied, only that they are habitual liars.\n\n\u201cBut the Childhood Health Insurance Plan ... ,\u201d they will tell you. Republicans were already unanimously in favor of CHIP. They were going to fund it anyway!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut we secured a vote for DACA,\u201d they say.\n\nA vote? A motherfucking vote? How can you stand in front of black, Hispanic and Muslim voters for a year telling them how the Republicans were lying, xenophobic racists, and then turn around and explain to those same voters how you acquiesced because they promised you that they would perhaps think about considering the possibility of allowing a vote on something they vehemently hate?\n\nThe Democratic Party is better than the Republican Party in the way that manslaughter is slightly better than murder: It might seem like a lesser crime, but the victim can\u2019t really tell the difference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemocrats are the minority party. They know that Republicans will never vote for DACA unless it comes with funding for a wall, and the only thing Dems could negotiate out of a government shutdown was a vote where the entire world will get to see them lose. (OK, I admit that the entire world probably doesn\u2019t watch CSPAN, but still ... )\n\nBut this is how the Democratic Party operates. It is impossible to say whether they remain perpetual losers because of a lack of a plan or because they don\u2019t give a fuck about their nonwhite constituents, but it is telling that their losses somehow always end up costing black and brown people. Always. So much so that I struggle to see how their slick-mouthed equivocation somehow keeps tricking black people into believing that they are on our side.\n\nThey are not.\n\nThe Democratic Party is better than the Republican Party in the way that manslaughter is slightly better than murder: It might seem like a lesser crime, but the victim can\u2019t really tell the difference. In exchange for the unwavering loyalty of black America, we get to live with the Democratic Party\u2019s arm being shoved so far up our anal cavities that not only are we used to acting as their puppets, but we have become comfortable with it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet there are some people so stuck in their binary thinking that they believe that not voting for Democrats, or withholding our vote from the party until we can get something solid in return, is a crazy idea. They will tell you that voting for a third-party candidate is a losing proposition.\n\nI have a rebuttal to that, but first I will have to switch to all caps, because I am about to yell. To those people I say:\n\nYOU ACT AS IF WE ARE WINNING!\n\nSo here we are again, left out in the cold while the Democratic Party gets warm and cozy behind the artifice of solidarity and equality. They are tricksters. They will sit at the table of our last supper and break bread with us, knowing that they have already conspired with the enemy planning our crucifixion. We know they are going to betray us, but we are always surprised when the cock crows.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey get us every time.\n\nThey will lock arms with you and claim that they are your \u201cride or die.\u201d They are always by your side, but if there ever comes a time when you have to stand back-to-back and fight, those white friends will likely disappear. They are always willing to ride. They are never willing to die.\n\nThey will suck down Champagne in the VIP section of the club like the Dems did after the special election for Alabama\u2019s Senate seat. White women were shaking their titties, taking shots of Patr\u00f3n, screaming, \u201cWe did it,\u201d balling out like they were in a P. Diddy video, knowing that black women were the ones who paid the bill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite friends will bounce to the music, singing how they are \u201cdown for their niggas.\u201d Black people watch them dance, smile and vote for them, but whenever the Republicans even hint that they are buck, the Democratic Party is never willing to knuck.\n\nEven when the Democratic Caucus controlled the House and the Senate, they didn\u2019t introduce a single piece of legislation addressing extrajudicial police killings. They still haven\u2019t addressed the Supreme Court\u2019s dismantling of the Voting Rights Act. They haven\u2019t used their clout to direct federal dollars to underfunded schools. They disregard HBCUs. They run from affirmative action. They dodge any mention of reparations.\n\nAnd none of this is to say that the Dems\u2019 duplicity is the fault of the Democratic Party or white people. It is the fault of black people. We have empowered them. No Democrat could win a local, state or national election without the black vote. It is black voters\u2019 fault that we don\u2019t demand anything in return but lip service and bumper stickers. If your employer hired you, paid you every week and never required that you produce any results, how hard would you work?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy grandmother eventually fell out with the Egg Man when he upped his price and started going door-to-door, cutting my grandmother out of the loop. My grandmother, in her infinite pettiness, bought eggs at cost from the supermarket and sold them to her neighbors for a price cheaper than the Egg Man\u2019s, losing money in the process, but neutering the Egg Man. When he came back to our house to cut a deal, she refused.\n\nUntil she died, part of my grandmother\u2019s paycheck went to selling those eggs to people in my neighborhood at a loss. She did it for only one reason\u2014again, I will have to switch to all caps to convey her exact sentiment (and I\u2019m paraphrasing here):\n\nFUCK. THAT. WHITE. MAN.\n\nWhite friends, the Egg Man, Judas Iscariot and the Democratic Party are all the same. Pieces of silver have always been more important to them than black souls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am sure that a broad association of betrayal, disloyalty and dishonesty with white people will cause some to dismiss this entire argument. I challenge those people to scan back through this entire diatribe and find the lie. Even though it might sound mean and prejudiced, I assure you that I can\u2019t be racist ...\n\n\n\nSome of my best friends are Democrats.", "keywords": ["party", "feels", "friends", "vote", "grandmother", "entire", "black", "white", "friend", "egg", "democratic"], "polarity": 0.01877151719671405, "subjectivity": 0.4567366579177601},

Per usual, black women showed up and showed out at the ballot box, helping Doug Jones win Jeff Sessions\u2019 vacated Senate seat in what was supposed to be a safe victory for Republican candidate Roy Moore.\n\nAll against robust voter-suppression efforts.\n\nA Washington Post exit poll shows that 98 percent of black women voted for Jones, compared with the 63 percent of white women who voted for Moore, a man who faces accusations from several women claiming that he sexually assaulted them as teenagers. It is clear that black women are the moral force of America. Let\u2019s keep it 100. Black women knew the stakes were high. Had Moore won, he would have been one more pro-Donald Trump degenerate black people had to contend with.\n\nBlack women said, \u201cNah, we gon\u2019 come out and take care of this mess.\u201d\n\nThey have always been enthusiastic about voting, as evidenced by the fact that they have outvoted black men since 1984 (pdf). Social protests, namely the shooting deaths of black men by police officers, have already energized black women to hit the streets. That they would harness that same energy to ensure that a racist woman hater would not win a Senate seat should surprise no one.\n\n\u201cBlack women have been leading in grassroots organizing that\u2019s been happening across the South and the nation for several years, particularly since the Trayvon Martin case,\u201d said Bree Newsome, an activist who made international news for scaling a flag post to take down a Confederate flag in South Carolina in 2015. \u201cMany interpret the resistance as having begun in January of 2017, but what we are seeing now is the electoral result of long-term organizing efforts spearheaded by black women. We were actively resisting racism and sexism before Trump and the Alabama Senate race.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComparatively, white female voters in Alabama proved, yet again, that they cannot be trusted. Essentially, as they did in the 2016 presidential election, white women chose their race over their gender. Upholding white supremacy and patriarchy is still their priority. It is understandable why so many of us declared that \u201cblack women saved America.\u201d\n\nBut let\u2019s be real. White women in Alabama did not really want to be saved. They voted for an alleged child molester. In reality, black women care about themselves and their futures. Republicans in the U.S. Senate support a tax bill that purges the middle class and rally behind a president who attacks Obamacare, which black women rely on and white women need, but they\u2019re too blinded by their racism to realize it.\n\nMeanwhile, #BlackWomen is trending on Twitter, celebrating the organizing power of black female voters. Black women took time to remind readers of what the next steps should be:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking of some of the \u201cy\u2019all,\u201d I asked Leah Wright Rigueur, a professor at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, why so many white women backed Moore despite his alleged history of sexual assault:\n\nMany do so for complicated reasons, including the fact that they\u2019ve voted Republican their entire life and can\u2019t envision voting for a Democrat. Others do so for less complicated reasons: They support the Republican agenda and therefore will support whatever candidate holds the GOP banner aloft. And then, of course, you have people that will tie themselves in knots to try and rationalize their support of Moore, when, at the end of the day, it boils down to fact that they believe what Moore believes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoom.\n\nBlack women didn\u2019t do this just for Jones or America or the Democratic Party. It\u2019s not as if the relationship is reciprocal in the first place. Black women showed up last night because they are the most eager for progressive change, even though they have historically gotten little in return for it. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) is the only black woman in the U.S. Senate, and black women make up a mere 3.6 percent of Congress, according to Higher Heights. They make up just 3.7 percent of state legislators nationwide and 14.7 percent of all female state legislators in the country. There are only two black lieutenant governors in the union (both men), and no state has ever elected a black female governor. (Ahem, Democratic National Committee, there is a black woman named Stacey Abrams running for Georgia governor.)\n\nMoreover, black women make 63 cents (pdf) of the white man\u2019s dollar, despite being head of the household for more than 50 percent of families with children under 18. They suffer the highest mortality rates after childbirth, and 12 percent (pdf) are uninsured, twice the rate of white women. It\u2019s as if black women keep investing in the Democrats\u2019 stock but get almost no cashable return.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while praise for black women on Twitter this morning abounds, people should consider how to look at black female voters beyond being mules for the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between \u2018Black women should do the work\u2019 and \u2018We need to support black women who are doing work,\u2019\u201d said L. Joy Williams, chairwoman of Higher Heights. \u201cIt needs to come with resources and actual support, and not just tweets and retweets and a hashtag.\u201d\n\nThe days of simply thanking black women for saving the day and giving them nothing in return must end. Black women running for office at all levels need money. Lots of it. The DNC needs to appoint them to positions of power in Washington, D.C., and at the local and state levels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe next step is for, not only the DNC, [but] the DCCC [Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee], DSCC [Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee] and all of the Democratic operations ... to evaluate how much of their resources they are going to invest into black women and voters in general way before we get to the end of 2018,\u201d Williams added.\n\nThat is the best thank-you the party and America could offer them.", "keywords": ["support", "saved", "senate", "alabama", "moore", "voters", "women", "night", "voted", "black", "white", "female", "democratic"], "polarity": 0.0004219077568134182, "subjectivity": 0.35432315064390524},

Even with his problematic campaign, he was one of the good ones. He would remember what black voters did for him. How could he not recognize that the only reason he is now referred to as \u201cSen. Doug Jones from the state of Alabama\u201d is the black vote? After all, he\u2019s a Democrat. How could he forget who put him there?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn return, Doug Jones and the Democratic Party, once again, have thrown black people to the wolves.\n\nPolitico magazine reports that on Wednesday, the Senate passed a bank-deregulation bill that rolls back many of the regulations imposed on banks and lenders. The bill passed with the support of the Trump administration, Republican senators and 17 Democratic senators\u2014most of whom are considered to be moderate or conservative Dems. The legislation now moves to the House of Representatives, where it is expected to pass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more than a decade I have been trying to push the idea that blackness has evolved past its murky racial and cultural definition. As a college macroeconomics instructor, I taught a class, Race as an Economic Construct, that advocated examining race through the lens of data and numbers. (The science of economics is not limited to the production and distribution of goods, services and wealth.)\n\nOne of the easiest ways to illustrate this point is with the history of black homeownership. Homeownership is the biggest builder of wealth in America and is still affected by the history of segregation, Jim Crow and redlining. It fuels every indicator of discrimination in this country and is one of the best examples of the manifestation of white supremacy.\n\nHousing discrimination relegated African Americans to homogeneous, poor black communities with underfunded, segregated schools. Poorer schools create the education gap. The education gap creates employment disparities. Underemployment creates poverty and the phenomenon called \u201cblack-on-black crime.\u201d Poverty leads to the inability to acquire affordable housing, which relegates black people to low-income communities, which leads to underfunded schools, which leads to more crime and so on. It is a vicious circle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is all about homeownership.\n\nWe have always known this. The Root has routinely reported on the difficulties black people encounter when buying a home. A recent report by the Center for Investigative Reporting, along with Reveal News, uncovered how U.S. banks systematically prevent blacks and Hispanics from becoming homeowners.\n\nJPMorgan Chase paid $55 million in January to settle charges that it discriminated against black and Latino borrowers. In 2011, Bank of America handed over $335 million for making its minority customers pay more than its white customers for the same loans. A federal lawsuit against Wells Fargo alleges that the bank has discriminated against Philadelphia\u2019s black and Latino borrowers since 2004.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is an indisputable fact that many banks treat their black customers unequally. The only reason we know this is that banks are required to report demographic data on most mortgage loans. That data is publicly available to anyone who wants to look at it.\n\nAmong other things, the legislation passed by the Senate on Wednesday strips away for some banks the requirement to report the race, ethnicity and gender of their mortgage customers. Under the new proposal, only the largest banks will have to report demographic data, which means that it will be impossible to find out if the other banks discriminate. If the law passes, these banks will be able to deny black customers without fear of repercussion or lawsuits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Democratic Party could have singled out that provision to the public and made a fuss. They could have called it racist (because it is racist), which would have made the legislation lose support. They could easily have refused to vote for this bill unless that specific provision was stripped away.\n\nSen. Doug Jones from the state of Alabama voted for it.\n\nThis is the Democratic Party.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The Democratic Party is only a viable party because of the black vote. In the 2016 election, 88 percent of blacks voted for the Democratic candidate, while only 37 percent of whites voted for Hillary Clinton, according to exit polls by USA Today. Even before the most recent election, according to Pew Research, only 40 percent of whites identified as Democrats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf not for black voters, there would not be a Democratic Party. Without the black vote, Dems would lose every election at the local, state and national levels. The Democratic Party\u2019s leadership knows this. The Republican Party knows this.\n\nYet Democratic politicians repeatedly refuse to stand up for the issues that affect black people the most. They continue to confirm President Donald Trump\u2019s federal court appointees, who will hear cases of police brutality and voter-ID-law discrimination, despite the fact that he has failed to nominate a single African-American or Latino judge to the federal bench.\n\nThey ignored the suggestion that they filibuster every bill until the Senate and House look at gun control legislation to curb the violence that affects black communities disproportionately. They caved on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals vote during the recent government shutdown. (We often forget how immigration laws disproportionately affect African and Caribbean immigrants.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is the solution?\n\nAs usual, all politics is local. Imagine if\u2014at the local level, which affects us the most\u2014black candidates ran on non-Democratic platforms touting issues that are supported by black voters. In Georgia, there might be the \u201cKeisha\u201d Party, which works on stopping freeways from catching on fire and collapsing. Chicago might have a \u201cTop Gang Thugs\u201d Party.\n\nWhat if we supported valid third-party candidates who aren\u2019t beholden to an agenda beholden to Democratic apologists? What if we\u2014even in one single election\u2014wrote in our own choices? What if we stopped participating in this antiquated, binary system of choices?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis would force the national Democratic Party to engage with and pay attention to black voters and black issues. It would also stop Democrat politicians from appearing in black churches and barbershops only during voting season, and pretending that black voters don\u2019t exist in the intervening periods.\n\nOf course, there is the argument that if black voters didn\u2019t support the Democratic Party, Republicans would take over. Answering that question requires me to switch to all caps. Please hold on.\n\nHOW THE HELL ARE WE WINNING NOW?\n\nRepublicans already control 32 state legislatures, 33 governorships, the U.S. Senate, the House of Representatives and the presidency. They are already in control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven with that mostly white, Republican control, the Democratic Party refuses to stand by the side of the people most responsible for the party\u2019s existence. Democratic politicians slither away whenever they are challenged, and compromise at every instance of Republican obstinance (not you, Auntie Maxine; we\u2019re still riding with you).\n\nAnd when it comes to Doug Jones, even though he received 93 percent of the black male vote and a whopping 98 percent of the black female vote, he has not demonstrated that he intends to do anything for black Alabama voters. Jones has supported Trump\u2019s position on 60 percent of the issues since black voters sent him to the Senate.\n\nYet black voters will overwhelmingly vote Democrat in the upcoming midterm elections, after which we will sit back and wait for the Democratic Party to take over both branches of the legislature and begin hearings to impeach Trump and his anti-black agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m betting it will never happen\u2014not because I am a cynic, but because I know history. I am exhausted from being punished for the good deeds of black people. I have learned what happens when I place my trust in Democrats or good white men.\n\nMy grandmother taught me that.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This post has been updated to clarify that the largest banks will still be required to report their demographic data.", "keywords": ["party", "banks", "jones", "doug", "vote", "senate", "voters", "report", "black", "white", "screwed", "democratic"], "polarity": 0.04582119900301719, "subjectivity": 0.43329168306440996},

It\u2019s as if black people were considering voting for the child molester until some brilliant strategist posited, \u201cWhat if he were black, though?\u201d The flyer is reductive in its oversimplification of the black mind as only caring about black issues. While it might not be racist, it is certainly racist adjacent.\n\n\n\nIt is also the Democratic Party.\n\nPart of the reason the Democratic Party has been marginalized as a party that only exists on the coasts and in urban areas is white-mannery like this. While the policies of the party may be more progressive and black-friendly, the Democratic leadership is often as prejudiced and shortsighted as its Republican counterparts, and next week\u2019s Senate election is the perfect example.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Democratic Party is trash. It is the reason Hillary Clinton lost. It is the reason Donald Trump is president. It is the reason I might be represented in the U.S. Senate by a grown man who probably went to see Twilight in the theaters and stood by the candy counter asking teenage girls if they wanted a sugar daddy.\n\nUntil the stories surfaced about Roy Moore\u2019s predilection for prepubescent ponytail wearers, the Democratic Party had wholly abandoned Alabama. It treated minorities and Democratic-leaning whites in the South like every black character in horror movies: necessary casualties left behind for the greater good.\n\nThe party only campaigns in already-Democratic strongholds for the scant few electoral votes during presidential elections, and the rest of the time it ignores them completely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the rare occasions when the Democratic Party does address black voters, it only talks about the \u201cblack issues\u201d: policing, mass incarceration, civil rights, etc. For the party leadership, black people aren\u2019t whole people who have the same concerns about taxes, job creation, education initiatives, international policy and economics as other voters. They are simply bodies collected in the coffers of the party\u2019s ineffective longing for power.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re more than civil rights. We\u2019re bigger than fish fries. And we want to be heard.\ufeff\u201d \u2014Edward Bowser, Birmingham, Ala.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow that Dems think Doug Jones has a decent chance to pick up a Senate seat, they have turned to Alabama\u2019s black electorate as if they were in the state the entire time. Furthermore, the only argument they have made in their efforts to convince black voters to vote for Jones is that one thing he did for black people that one time. Every solicitation is the same: \u201cRemember when he convicted the racists who bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church? See? He\u2019s down!\u201d\n\nEdward Bowser, a Birmingham resident, said it best:\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because, like most reasonable, thoughtful Alabamians, I really want Jones to win\u2014and believe me, scandal or not, his victory is far from guaranteed. This state is redder than the bottom of Cardi B\u2019s shoes, after all. But Jones\u2019 campaign has done such a poor job speaking to the black community that my passion has fizzled. Severely. And this isn\u2019t a new predicament. WashPo and other news outlets might now just be picking up on the trend, but black voters have long been discouraged. I appreciate what Doug Jones did in prosecuting KKK members in the deaths of four innocent girls. But when that\u2019s the one and only message of black interest coming from your campaign, it shows an extreme disconnect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven if they convince us to vote, even if Doug Jones wins, it doesn\u2019t mean Dems are going to go hard for us like the Republicans go hard for their base. The floor of Trump\u2019s core supporters is probably a 25-30 percent, mostly Southern minority. Who does that remind you of?\n\nThe Republican Party wins not only because it caters to its base, but because (and this is the important part) it goes all out in efforts to convince the rest of the mainstream voters to get on board.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you look at the poll numbers, a vast number of Republican voters disagree with their party on gun control, abortion or white supremacy (well, maybe not white supremacy, but still ... ). But the party leadership finds a way to convince them to vote for the party. They talk about job creation, lowering taxes and kitchen-table issues.\n\nTrump will go to a Detroit church and try to change a few minds. The Democratic Party only competes where it knows it will win. Had Hillary Clinton not taken votes for granted in certain states, she might have won the Electoral College. (After you read that sentence, if you listen closely, you can hear a white woman say, \u201cBut she won the popular vote, though ... \u201d)\n\nYet Democrats treat blacks in the South like stepchildren from a previous marriage: They\u2019ll have us over for weekends and election holidays, smile and act nice, but they don\u2019t really do shit for us. They treat the new kids better. The white ones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSay what you will about the toothless dimwits who buy \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats, but they are getting almost everything they wanted. Trump is rounding up immigrants, normalizing white supremacy, reinstituting the war on drugs, trying his damnedest to keep Muslims out of the country, and he\u2019s still on that bullshit about the wall.\n\n\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand? Trash.\n\nBlack voters are the base of the Democratic Party, and we\u2019re still waiting for Dems to fix the wage gap and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. They aren\u2019t going to listen because they never do. They pocket black votes and black dollars, and take them back to the national party to spend in districts where they know they\u2019re going to win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis has always been the modus operandi of the party, but it was rescued over the past decade by Barack Obama, a black candidate black voters in the South adored. He mobilized both black and white voters in the South by canvassing, using foot soldiers and going after every vote, even turning some red states blue. Now that he\u2019s gone, the Dems are back on that old shit ... until they need us again.\n\nThe Democratic Party is so white and rigid that the last person to bring any new enthusiasm to the masses was a 187-year-old socialist who sounded like the aardvark from the Pink Panther cartoons and never really claimed the party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfrican Americans in the South register more often and are more likely to cast ballots than anywhere else in the country. Yet the Democratic Party squanders the opportunity to make meaningful gains among whites, moderates and apathetic blacks.\n\nAccording to the U.S. census, Alabama\u2019s voting-age population is 26 percent black. Black voters in Alabama (and the Deep South as a whole) tend to skew more conservative on social issues. If the Democratic Party focused on running candidates that aligned with the party\u2019s values while not so stringently adhering to the national party\u2019s platform, it could rally enthusiasm among black voters and steal some white votes, too. While not ideal, moderate candidates who could caucus with Democrats would be better than no candidates at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlabama is the perfect example. The recent contentious mayoral election in Birmingham excited the entire electorate in one of the blackest cities in the country. Even though blacks were out in droves, the party didn\u2019t use it to push the state Senate race. But you know ... despite the rhetoric about diversity and inclusion, the Democratic National Committee is still a predominantly white institution.\n\n\n\nIf you look at the names of the faces of Democratic leadership, it\u2019s not noticeably different from that of the GOP. Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer and the darling of the left\u2014Elizabeth Warren\u2014are old, white rich people from the coasts. Had it not been for a Russian hacking, the head of the DNC would still be lil\u2019 Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\n\nThe Democratic Party is so white and rigid that the last person to bring any new enthusiasm to the masses was a 187-year-old socialist who sounded like the aardvark from the Pink Panther cartoons and never really claimed the party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause I am a registered Democrat, a few days ago I received a call from Doug Jones\u2019 campaign. The only issues the caller spoke of were the accusations surrounding Moore and Jones\u2019 seemingly singular accomplishment. As Bowser put it:\n\nWe know Roy Moore is a monster, a total embarrassment to our state. But in the eyes of black voters, what makes him more of a monster than the parade of sleazy politicians who have stood against black interests for generations? So yes, I\u2019m voting for Doug Jones but only because it\u2019s a vote against Roy Moore. And that\u2019s not good enough to rally a base of voters who are already stricken with apathy. We\u2019re more than civil rights. We\u2019re bigger than fish fries. And we want to be heard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust like for this country, the black vote is the lifeblood of the Democratic Party. But party leaders don\u2019t respect it; nor do they appreciate it. They take it for granted.

They should remember that he warned us about white moderates who preferred a negative peace, which is the absence of tension, to a positive peace, which is the presence of justice.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey should remember that King called the U.S. government \u201cthe greatest purveyor of violence in the world today\u201d\u2014and that we only have to look to Honduras, Libya, Yemen and the occupied black, brown and indigenous communities right here in this country to know that the same holds true today with the support of the Democratic Party.\n\nIt would serve the Democratic Party well to reckon with its own role in global and state violence. These so-called white liberals at the forefront of \u201cthe resistance\u201d should acknowledge how loud their collective silence is while the most targeted among us continue without access to quality health care or education, while police officers continue to kill black, brown and indigenous people with impunity.

These are historical statements from yesteryear describing a despised race of people in America. They are indicative of the sentiment of white people throughout this country who thought a subhuman species good for nothing but work and servitude might ruin America with their crime, poverty and interbreeding with white women. They were not referring to Africans, Mexicans or Muslims.\n\nThey were talking about the Irish.\n\nFirst, we should get this out of the way: One of the favorite recurring themes of racists in America is the idea that the Irish came to America as slaves and had it as bad as, or worse than, Africans. According to these \u201cracialists,\u201d the European blood in the Irish made them pull themselves up by their bootstraps and integrate themselves into the opening arms of American liberty. They never bitched and moaned about their situation, so ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of this is wrong. In fact, it is too stupid to give space, credence or words, so read where it is debunked here and here.\n\nBut as we celebrate the first St. Patrick\u2019s Day of the Trumpian era, we should remember when America passed laws against another group of immigrants. We should recall when this country tried to ban another group of people based on their religion. We should never forget that both \u201cAmerican\u201d and whiteness are sociopolitical constructs that have evolved over a long period of time, always seeking exclusion and supremacy, and it was not so long ago that Irish Americans were on the outside looking in.\n\nIn his book The Renegade History of the United States, Thaddeus Russell explains that the first large wave of Irish immigrants worked low-paying jobs\u2014mostly building the canals along the Canadian border\u2014that other Americans wouldn\u2019t do. Like finding out a song you thought was new is actually a 100-year-old remake, the Irish were simultaneously accused of stealing all the good jobs and branded as \u201clazy\u201d and \u201cshiftless.\u201d They were also thought to be the nonwhite \u201cmissing link\u201d between the superior European and the savage African based on stereotypes from the early American media, according to the Boston Globe:\n\nIn the popular press, the Irish were depicted as subhuman. They were carriers of disease. They were drawn as lazy, clannish, unclean, drunken brawlers who wallowed in crime and bred like rats. Most disturbingly, the Irish were Roman Catholics coming to an overwhelmingly Protestant nation and their devotion to the pope made their allegiance to the United States suspect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1798, Congress passed three \u201cAlien Acts\u201d based mainly on fears of Irish-Catholic, anti-immigrant sentiment. These new laws gave the president the power to stop immigration from any country at war with the U.S. and the right to deport any immigrant, and made it harder for immigrants to vote. Then, again in the late 1840s, a nationalist political group called the Know-Nothings sprang from a populist movement of poor whites who were dissatisfied with the two-party system and started the American Party, intent on preserving America\u2019s culture by restricting immigration, especially from Catholic countries\u2014including by Irish Catholics. They managed to get candidates elected into the highest political offices in America, including a president.\n\nDoes this sound familiar to anyone?\n\nSo how did the Irish become white?\n\nRussell suggests they did it by coalescing their political power while simultaneously assimilating into the American mainstream, specifically with jobs in civil service (which is why most cities\u2019 St. Patrick Day parades are ostensibly celebrations of police and fire departments):\n\nIn 1840, at the beginning of the great wave of Irish immigration, there was only a handful of Irish police officers on the force. ... By the end of the year, Irish made up more than one-quarter of the New York City police, and by the end of the century, more than half the city\u2019s police and more than 75 percent of its firefighters were Irish Americans. In addition, Irish were disproportionately represented among prosecutors, judges and prison guards. Soon, the Irish cop was a stock figure in American culture. Once known as apelike barbarians, the Irish were now able to show themselves as the most selfless and patriotic civil servants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his book How the Irish Became White, author Noel Ignatiev notes, \u201cWhile the white skin made the Irish eligible for membership in the white race, it did not guarantee their admission; they had to earn it.\u201d Ignatiev and other scholars argue that the sons of Ireland gained their white status by joining the fight against abolition and uniting in the suppression of blacks\u2014embracing the oldest American tradition of them all: racism.\n\n\u201cWhile Irish American repealers maintained a pride and love for their homeland, they acted unabashedly American in the way they dealt with the slavery controversy.\u201d\u2014Angela F. Murphy in American Slavery, Irish Freedom: Abolition, Immigrant Citizenship, and the Transatlantic Movement for Irish Repeal\n\nBut there is a simpler, less complex explanation for how this country eventually came to view the Irish as regular, good, American white people:\n\nThey just did it.\n\n\u201cWhiteness\u201d isn\u2019t real. Ultimately, race is a social construct, and \u201cwhite\u201d is just some dumb shit that people made up a long time ago to build a fence around their idea of self-supremacy. The Irish didn\u2019t suddenly calm down, put down the Guinness, put their noses to the grindstone and work their way into an exclusive club. They had the same historical trajectory in America as the Polish, Italians and Jewish people. Their melanin-less skin just afforded them an opportunity to blend in that black people will never get.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cgreat white race\u201d is as real as a mermaid riding a unicorn on the back of a dragon while listening to dope lyrics from Lil Uzi, and that\u2019s why white supremacy is so stupid. People who perpetuate that bullshit should be paid the same attention as alt-right advocates, Hoteps, flat-earthers and anyone who owns an Iggy Azalea album.\n\nSo later tonight, as you\u2019re kneeling by the toilet blowing chunks of corned beef and green beer, if you start thinking about how poorly we treat immigrants and how we live in a new era of intolerance and hate, just remember how the Irish became white.

Can a political party toss over $1 billion into the trash two election cycles in a row? Does it really take a genius to figure out that if a group votes for you 90 percent of the time, you should do what it takes to make sure that group is at the polling place on Election Day?\n\n\n\nBoth Hillary Clinton and Jon Ossoff, a Democrat who ran for Congress out of Georgia\u2019s 6th District and lost, taught us that no amount of money can eclipse the power of votes. Clinton\u2019s campaign spent over $1.2 billion to lose. A harder look at the numbers reveals that blacks stayed home in Michigan and Pennsylvania. And in Georgia, Ossoff spent over $20 million and lost.\n\nThe hard fact is that the Democratic Party has no history of taking the strategic advice of African-American elected officials, leaders or consultants and applying substantial financial backing to black voter outreach. Will new Democratic National Committee Deputy Chair Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) be listened to? Who knows.\n\nIf past is prologue, everyone knows what happens next: Senior black officials asking the party for field help will be ignored, and instead, Democrats will stage a few visits to black churches two Sundays before Election Day, followed by that crash panic of activity days before Election Day.\n\nIt was white women who gave 53 percent support to Donald Trump. It was Hispanic voters who gave Trump 29 percent of their support. African Americans voted for Clinton at 93 percent. You\u2019d think that lots of energy to get that group out would be common sense after black women were No. 1 in turnout percentage of any voting group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn May 25, a group of female African-American elected officials, activists and others wrote an open letter to DNC Chair Tom Perez. They knew to make it \u201copen\u201d because had they written it without it being open, the DNC would have pretended that it didn\u2019t exist. They wrote:\n\n\n\nBlack women cast a total of 11.4 million ballots, providing the margin he needed to win. This past November, even with a clear lack of voter mobilization investment and a decrease in overall Black voter turnout, 94 percent of Black women voted to keep this country moving forward by casting ballots for Hillary Clinton.\n\nShouldn\u2019t that be obvious? Black turnout dove to 2004 levels in 2016 after Democrats decided that the record numbers seen in 2008 and 2012 would magically persist without President Barack Obama on the ticket.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn June 28, Perez met with many of the group of black women who wrote to him about black-voter outreach. The results were predictable: general talk of \u201ca good beginning\u201d and \u201cgive us a plan of action and we\u2019ll meet again.\u201d Even when presented with a clear list of demands and long-standing data to support the importance of the black vote, Democrats still place their focus elsewhere.\n\nOn June 29, a day after Perez met with the black women who wrote him on the need for focused and targeted black-voter effort, House Majority PAC, the largest super PAC focused on House races, announced a major research project to study \u201cwhite working-class voters.\u201d\n\nThere were over 130,000 African Americans in South Carolina\u2019s 5th Congressional District. Did the Democratic Party attempt to make a vigorous effort to turn them out? No. More than 90 percent of African-American voters vote for the Democratic Party. Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) asked for $200,000 to get out that vote. The answer was no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn June 22, The Root asked Clyburn if he could remember a time when the Democratic Party has listened to blacks on strategy.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t really thought about that,\u201d said Clyburn, with a smile in an ornate lobby off of the House floor. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t this time,\u201d he added.\n\nClyburn will turn 77 next month and has been in Congress since 1993. If Democrats in charge of strategic decisions aren\u2019t listing to him when it comes to black-voter outreach, who are they listening to? Speaking with several other senior black Democrats reveals the same scenario.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEvery dollar spent wooing Republicans is money flushed down the drain,\u201d stated Steve Phillips of Democracy in Color on the Georgia 6th Congressional District race. Phillips is urging the Democratic Party to focus on its base and not Trump\u2019s \u201cwhite working-class voters\u201d who have become the party\u2019s obsession. Let\u2019s see if anyone listens going into 2018. Or will there be another \u201cbillion-dollar blunder,\u201d as Phillips defined it, like in 2016?\n\nDays after Phillips released his report on June 23, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced that Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.) would lead an effort to focus on Trump voters in a new role as \u201cchair of heartland engagement.\u201d The effort will focus on doing \u201ca better job of listening to the hardworking families from small towns and rural communities.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have lost over 900 state legislative seats since 2008. They lost 63 U.S. House seats in 2010, along with six U.S. Senate seats. The same decision-makers then are the same now. You\u2019d think that all that losing would prompt a rush to listen to other strategies coming from Steve Phillips or Cornell Belcher.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepublicans know the numbers and understand that their road to victory includes making it harder for members of the Democratic base to vote. Where\u2019s the DNC\u2019s anti-suppression campaign? Where\u2019s the get-out-the-vote effort to target black voters?

Furthermore, the only argument they have made in their efforts to convince black voters to vote for Jones is that one thing he did for black people that one time. Every solicitation is the same: \u201cRemember when he convicted the racists who bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church? See? He\u2019s down!\u201d\n\nEdward Bowser, a Birmingham resident, said it best:\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because, like most reasonable, thoughtful Alabamians, I really want Jones to win\u2014and believe me, scandal or not, his victory is far from guaranteed. This state is redder than the bottom of Cardi B\u2019s shoes, after all. But Jones\u2019 campaign has done such a poor job speaking to the black community that my passion has fizzled. Severely. And this isn\u2019t a new predicament. WashPo and other news outlets might now just be picking up on the trend, but black voters have long been discouraged. I appreciate what Doug Jones did in prosecuting KKK members in the deaths of four innocent girls. But when that\u2019s the one and only message of black interest coming from your campaign, it shows an extreme disconnect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven if they convince us to vote, even if Doug Jones wins, it doesn\u2019t mean Dems are going to go hard for us like the Republicans go hard for their base. The floor of Trump\u2019s core supporters is probably a 25-30 percent, mostly Southern minority. Who does that remind you of?\n\nThe Republican Party wins not only because it caters to its base, but because (and this is the important part) it goes all out in efforts to convince the rest of the mainstream voters to get on board.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you look at the poll numbers, a vast number of Republican voters disagree with their party on gun control, abortion or white supremacy (well, maybe not white supremacy, but still ... ). But the party leadership finds a way to convince them to vote for the party. They talk about job creation, lowering taxes and kitchen-table issues.\n\nTrump will go to a Detroit church and try to change a few minds. The Democratic Party only competes where it knows it will win. Had Hillary Clinton not taken votes for granted in certain states, she might have won the Electoral College.

They treat the new kids better. The white ones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSay what you will about the toothless dimwits who buy \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats, but they are getting almost everything they wanted.

Trash.\n\nBlack voters are the base of the Democratic Party, and we\u2019re still waiting for Dems to fix the wage gap and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. They aren\u2019t going to listen because they never do. They pocket black votes and black dollars, and take them back to the national party to spend in districts where they know they\u2019re going to win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis has always been the modus operandi of the party, but it was rescued over the past decade by Barack Obama, a black candidate black voters in the South adored.

Yet the Democratic Party squanders the opportunity to make meaningful gains among whites, moderates and apathetic blacks.\n\nAccording to the U.S. census, Alabama\u2019s voting-age population is 26 percent black. Black voters in Alabama (and the Deep South as a whole) tend to skew more conservative on social issues. If the Democratic Party focused on running candidates that aligned with the party\u2019s values while not so stringently adhering to the national party\u2019s platform, it could rally enthusiasm among black voters and steal some white votes, too. While not ideal, moderate candidates who could caucus with Democrats would be better than no candidates at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlabama is the perfect example. The recent contentious mayoral election in Birmingham excited the entire electorate in one of the blackest cities in the country. Even though blacks were out in droves, the party didn\u2019t use it to push the state Senate race. But you know ... despite the rhetoric about diversity and inclusion, the Democratic National Committee is still a predominantly white institution.\n\n\n\nIf you look at the names of the faces of Democratic leadership, it\u2019s not noticeably different from that of the GOP. Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer and the darling of the left\u2014Elizabeth Warren\u2014are old, white rich people from the coasts. Had it not been for a Russian hacking, the head of the DNC would still be lil\u2019 Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\n\nThe Democratic Party is so white and rigid that the last person to bring any new enthusiasm to the masses was a 187-year-old socialist who sounded like the aardvark from the Pink Panther cartoons and never really claimed the party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause I am a registered Democrat, a few days ago I received a call from Doug Jones\u2019 campaign. The only issues the caller spoke of were the accusations surrounding Moore and Jones\u2019 seemingly singular accomplishment. As Bowser put it:\n\nWe know Roy Moore is a monster, a total embarrassment to our state. But in the eyes of black voters, what makes him more of a monster than the parade of sleazy politicians who have stood against black interests for generations? So yes, I\u2019m voting for Doug Jones but only because it\u2019s a vote against Roy Moore. And that\u2019s not good enough to rally a base of voters who are already stricken with apathy. We\u2019re more than civil rights. We\u2019re bigger than fish fries. And we want to be heard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust like for this country, the black vote is the lifeblood of the Democratic Party. But party leaders don\u2019t respect it; nor do they appreciate it. They take it for granted. They treat black voters and their Southern constituency the way America treats music, culture, art and the entire economy upon which this country was built:\n\nAmerica loves everything black ...\n\nBlack people?

People, black and white, haven\u2019t hesitated to call Brazile out for what they consider half-truths or outright lies. When was the last time Gayle King had a heated on-air exchange with a CBS This Morning guest?\n\nWith so much heat, why wouldn\u2019t Brazile retreat to the nation\u2019s reigning Chocolate City? Rachelle O\u2019Neil, a staffer for Rep.

She revealed that she suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and was undergoing treatment.\n\nShe spent a lot of time on cybersecurity, as well as addressing corruption with the Democratic National Committee, acknowledging that she found that there were folks who never showed up for work making as much as $25,000 after she took over last summer.

Buck has not spoken publicly about the incident. Police have not charged anyone with a crime, even though multiple reports have surfaced that Buck had a predilection for young, black men. Even after a number of young, black male sex workers have stepped forward with apparent photographic evidence that Buck was one of their clients. Even after each one of those men separately told the same story: Not only did Buck have a fetish for black men, but he was known in West Hollywood\u2019s gay community as someone paying top dollar for the company of 20-something black escorts ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut only after injecting them with drugs.\n\nWest Hollywood is known as the \u201csymbolic heart\u201d of LGBTQ Los Angeles. During the 1930s, gay men and women gathered in bars in the then-unincorporated part of the city to skirt federal and state Prohibition laws. In 1967, two years before New York City\u2019s Greenwich Village Stonewall riots put the fight for gay and lesbian rights on the map, a protest organized by the Personal Rights in Defense and Education organization kick-started the West Coast movement in West Hollywood.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, the West Hollywood area has been incorporated as a city and is known nationwide as a home for a thriving, affluent gay population. The city is a liberal enclave and has recently rebranded itself as WeHo.\n\nBuck was born in 1954 and came out to his parents at the age of 16, according to WeHoville. In the 1980s, after living and traveling as a male model and actor, Buck began working in Arizona for a company that provided information for driver\u2019s licenses. According to WeHoville, in a 1987 interview with the Arizona Republic, Buck said that he saw so much potential in the struggling company that he bought it out of bankruptcy for $250,000. Five years later, he sold the company for more than $1 million profit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1987 Buck, described by the Arizona Republic in the same article as a \u201cmillionaire, self-acknowledged homosexual and registered Republican,\u201d launched himself into politics by leading an effort to impeach Arizona Gov. Evan Mecham.\n\nEven though Buck\u2019s campaign led to the successful impeachment of the governor, Buck left the Republican Party because of its intolerant stance on LGBTQ issues. According to the profile in WeHoville, after arrests on narcotics and public indecency charges, Buck eventually left Arizona and moved to West Hollywood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was in West Hollywood that Buck became a major political backer. He helped Democrat John D\u2019Amico win a seat on the West Hollywood City Council and pushed for the nation\u2019s first ban on the sale of fur products.\n\nAlthough donations to political action committees don\u2019t have to be disclosed, Buck gave $2,700\u2014the maximum amount possible\u2014to the Hillary Clinton campaign, and online sources show he has donated more than $250 million to Democratic candidates. A quick Google Images search turns up pictures of Buck with some of the most powerful Democratic politicians in the country, including Clinton and California Gov. Jerry Brown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf there was ever anybody in West Hollywood whose bed you expected a dead body to turn up in, it was Ed Buck.\u201d \u2014former West Hollywood Councilman Steve Martin\n\nIn 2017, Gemmel Moore relocated from Texas and moved to West Hollywood. Numerous friends of Moore confirmed his struggles with drugs, which, many say, were fueled by the fetishes of one of his most frequent clients\u2014Ed Buck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoore\u2019s roommate and best friend, Samuel Lloyd, alleges that Buck had an unhealthy obsession with Moore. \u201cHe went out there searching for other men that were struggling and on the streets and had no money ... men who had never experienced drugs before,\u201d said Lloyd at an October 21 community meeting. \u201cThis is the kind of guys Ed Buck searched for.\u201d\n\nLloyd added that Moore had grown afraid of Buck in the days before his death, saying that \u201cGemmel was scared of this man. He came and he laid in my arms and he was scared. Scared that this man was going to hurt him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLloyd said that Moore went to West Hollywood police a number of times to warn them about Buck to no avail.\n\nLloyd\u2019s allegations seem to be backed up by other men who provided photographic evidence of Buck\u2019s drug use with male escorts. Damar Love provided the WeHo Times with photographs of himself inside Buck\u2019s home. According to the Times, the pictures appeared to have been taken at the same apartment where Moore\u2019s body was found and show Love sitting next to a glass pipe often used to smoke crystal meth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLove told the WeHo Times that he serviced Buck at least three times. He stated that Buck insisted that Love turn off his cellphone and demanded that he do drugs before their encounter. In an interview with the WeHo Times, Love stated:\n\nWhen I get there, I always want my money up front, and that\u2019s how it always started. Initially, when I got there I understood that he was already well under the influence because he told me he had already been up for two days and was still doing drugs as far as liquid GHB, shooting meth\u2014crystal meth, and smoking it. When he insisted that I get high and continue to get high, that\u2019s when I started to do my research on him ... I was like, \u201cWhy are you insisting that I be high?\u201d\n\nWriter Jasmyne Cannick says she met with Love along with journalists from ABC 7 and the Los Angeles Times and provided a partial transcript of the interview, in which Love says he went to the police with this information:\n\nSo I go there [West Hollywood Sheriff\u2019s Station] and I basically let them know I\u2019m coming from an older friend\u2019s house\u2014at the time I didn\u2019t want to speak his name. But I did initially say that I feel like I was drugged. And because I was talking rapidly and constantly looking around tryin\u2019 to watch my back to see if someone was approaching me the only thing they would say is, \u201cYou\u2019re tweaking. You\u2019re under the influence and if you don\u2019t get away from here I\u2019m going to take you to jail for being under the influence.\u201d They didn\u2019t care to ask who it was or where did it happen, and I said, \u201cWell just let me write a statement down; you guys can give me a number for that I can use if I need to come back it\u2019d be available.\u201d He said, \u201cOK.\u201d He gave me a paper. I wrote it down.

The Republican guy running for governor of that state, former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie\u2014who\u2019s openly aligned his campaign with Confederate, xenophobic and pro-police sympathies\u2014could very well snatch the seat from Democrats Tuesday ... in the state where Charlottesville unfolded across millions of screens.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not even start on the state\u2019s legislative races in which Democrats (if they were really serious) have an opening to flip Richmond, former capital of the Confederacy that it was, from red to blue. Pure political malfeasance now unfolds in a state where nearly a quarter of the population is black and the Latino proportion, along with the Muslim demographics, continues to grow.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s equally sad that, about 10 months after the confirmation of Jeff Sessions as U.S. attorney general, Roy Moore\u2014a Klan-ish former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice harboring a Donald Trump-rally-sized grudge against voting rights and pretty much any progress black folks have made in the last half century\u2014is about to fill Sessions\u2019 vacant Senate seat without Democrats putting up much of a fight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Moore win on Dec. 12 would certainly make Sessions happy as he continues to aggressively roll back voting rights and affirmative action and up every ante in his government\u2019s war against \u201cblack identity extremists.\u201d\n\nMoore\u2019s almost certain victory is happening in a state that\u2019s about 30 percent black and where Republicans have waged robust voter-suppression warfare through voter-ID laws, reduced voter-registration access, shuttered places to vote and eliminating early voting. Alabama is also one of eight states that refuse to restore the voting rights of formerly convicted felons\u2014in a place where 54 percent of the prison population is black.\n\n\n\nOne common theme that keeps popping up is how the Democratic Party hates its black voters.

Easy: You act as if they don\u2019t exist and let Jones fall behind by an average of 10-plus points.\n\n\n\nHead north to Philadelphia\u2014where the majority of residents are black\u2014and you\u2019ll find overconfident, Hillary Clinton-acting Democrats allowing the pro-police union, pro-punishment Republican nominee Beth Grossman a competitive edge in the city\u2019s consequential district attorney race.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only has the Democratic nominee Larry Krasner cockily assumed that he\u2019ll win, but he\u2019s also underestimating the potential turnout of quiet, white Trump voters who are clustered up with those voters who wearily watch rising violence in a town experiencing a gentrifying economic reawakening.\n\nBlack turnout in Philly is so low during DA races, it\u2019s laughable; yet black folks are predictably\u2014and rightfully so\u2014the loudest when they\u2019re targeted by police and prosecutors. Meanwhile, local Democrats, battered by nonstop party corruption tales and convictions, believe that all they need is a voter-registration edge.\n\n\n\nCampaign 101: Registration doesn\u2019t mean turnout.\n\nAlong with a potential upset in Philly is a potential tragedy for Pennsylvania should the state lose the chance to install the first black state Supreme Court justice in more than 20 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019re squandering a great 2018 congressional midterms pregame moment.

There\u2019s no mention that says: \u201cHey, folks, you really want to hit these folks back where it hurts? Make sure you go to battle on Tuesday in Alabama, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSocial media is all punch-and-run with the toothless outrage porn in reaction to white supremacists.

The agreement\u2014signed by Amy Dacey, the former CEO of the DNC, and Robby Mook with a copy to Marc Elias\u2014specified that in exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC, Hillary would control the party\u2019s finances, strategy and all the money raised. Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director, and it would make final decisions on all the other staff. The DNC also was required to consult with the campaign about all other staffing, budgeting, data, analytics and mailings.\n\nI had been wondering why it was that I couldn\u2019t write a press release without passing it by [Clinton\u2019s headquarters in] Brooklyn [New York]. Well, here was the answer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrazile writes that she was shocked to discover that Politico\u2019s previous claim that the DNC had been \u201cessentially money laundering\u201d for Clinton through extravagant state fundraisers was not so far off the mark.\n\nThe funding arrangement with HFA and the victory fund agreement was not illegal, but it sure looked unethical. If the fight had been fair, one campaign would not have control of the party before the voters had decided which one they wanted to lead. This was not a criminal act, but as I saw it, it compromised the party\u2019s integrity.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) took it a step further. When CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper asked Warren on Thursday if she believed that the primary election had been rigged against Sanders, she simply responded, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClinton supporters touting the fact that the joint-fundraising agreement between the Clinton campaign and the DNC was reported in 2015 have dedicated themselves to the most disingenuous reading of this situation as possible. Despite NPR posting the entire text of the memorandum\u2014which supplemented the standard joint-fundraising agreement that Sanders signed as well, Clinton supporters continue to claim that Brazile is a liar. She may very well be, but not about this.\n\n\n\nThey claim that any critique of the arrangement is driven by politically illiterate pure-mongers with a so-called far-leftist agenda\u2014or people who believe that Fox News is anything other than white supremacist propaganda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nhttps://www.theroot.com/hillary-clinton-rigged-the-race-against-bernie-sanders-1820087834\n\nSome have decided to wallow in semantics and gaslighting, insisting that the primary could not have been \u201crigged\u201d because Sanders had the same opportunity to raise money for the Democratic Party as Clinton and chose not to do so. These people conveniently hopscotch over the reality that Sanders did not have internal party support, nor wealthy donors from Hollywood to Wall Street. Instead, he depended primarily on small donations from individual donors, effectively circumventing the established system and shocking the Democratic Party.\n\n\n\nThe problem here is not that the arrangement was illegal, but that it was completely legal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClinton, on the other hand, through the 2015 memorandum signed in addition to the joint-fundraising agreement, allegedly raised money \u201cfor the party\u201d to be used in the general election to support whomever the candidate might be, but the lion\u2019s share of those funds were rerouted directly to her campaign.\n\nPolitico reported in 2016:\n\nThe victory fund has transferred $3.8 million to the state parties, but almost all of that cash ($3.3 million, or 88 percent) was quickly transferred to the DNC, usually within a day or two, by the Clinton staffer who controls the committee, POLITICO\u2019s analysis of the FEC records found. By contrast, the victory fund has transferred $15.4 million to Clinton\u2019s campaign and $5.7 million to the DNC, which will work closely with Clinton\u2019s campaign if and when she becomes the party\u2019s nominee. And most of the $23.3 million spent directly by the victory fund has gone toward expenses that appear to have directly benefited Clinton\u2019s campaign, including $2.8 million for \u201csalary and overhead\u201d and $8.6 million for web advertising that mostly looks indistinguishable from Clinton campaign ads and that has helped Clinton build a network of small donors who will be critical in a general election expected to cost each side well in excess of $1 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrazile claims in her book that she didn\u2019t want to believe the stranglehold that Clinton had over the DNC, but she could no longer deny it once the evidence was staring her in the face.\n\n\u201cThe day that Donna discovered this, she called me and I almost passed out,\u201d Ray Buckley, the chairman of New Hampshire\u2019s Democratic Party, told the Chicago Tribune of that moment in 2016. \u201cWe were blatantly misled.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of Brazile\u2019s political maelstrom, liberals who once exalted the Clinton ally are now labeling her a dishonest, opportunist book peddler with self-serving motives\u2014i.e., book sales. The charges against Brazile are valid\u2014let\u2019s be clear on that\u2014and worthy of examination.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce Brazile became the ceremonial sacrifice on the altar of political corruption after being caught feeding Clinton debate questions during the primary race against Sanders, she showed none of this newly revealed turmoil that she expects observers to buy into like 6-year-olds with no knowledge of how corrupt politics work. Previously, when her collusion with the Clinton campaign was exposed, she insisted: \u201cMy conscience\u2014as an activist, as a strategist\u2014my conscience is very clear. ... If I had to do it all over again, I would know a hell of a lot more about cybersecurity.\u201d\n\nThis is what democracy hypocrisy looks like.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Brazile meant was that she would know next time to hide her dirt better\u2014and Clinton supporters were fine with that because Brazile was playing the game as she was expected to play it. After all, who did Bernie Sanders think he was\u2014a Democrat? According to Clinton supporters, it was foolish to expect the Democratic Party to show the same support for an independent who, despite caucusing with Democrats, would always be considered an interloper.\n\n\n\nBrazile laughed off her willing participation in the rigged debate as commonplace political gamesmanship\u2014hey, that\u2019s just the way it is. Now, though, we\u2019re supposed to believe that when she discovered the shockingly unethical nature of the agreement between Clinton and the DNC, she was swimming in tortured emotions. That she was so distraught as she \u201ccentered\u201d herself to \u201ccall Bernie\u201d that she had to light candles, listen to gospel music and pray that Jesus would take the wheel.\n\nCompletely innocent and ethical Donna from New Orleans was shocked by the murky depths of the swamp. That\u2019s what we\u2019re supposed to believe.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn her book excerpt, Brazile manages to cast blame on the Clinton campaign, former DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the DNC leadership and former President Barack Obama, who apparently \u201cneglected\u201d the party, borrowed too much money and paid it back too slowly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI haven\u2019t had the opportunity to read Brazile\u2019s book, but I do wonder if she, in her newfound allegiance to truth and transparency, takes any semblance of responsibility for her own unethical actions in any of the chapters.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m lying. I don\u2019t wonder. The answer is most certainly no.\n\nA rigged system does not ensure that those in power win each time; it ensures that the status quo remains the same.\n\nClearly, whatever Brazile was promised or expecting for playing ball didn\u2019t pan out. Clinton supporters may pretend that false outrage and facts are mutually exclusive, but we know that\u2019s far from the truth. Brazile may have self-serving reasons for coming forward now\u2014including, but not limited to, book sales and getting in where she fits among the growing contingent of progressive black women who realize that the Democratic Party is failing them. Brazile is smart enough to want to catch the wave.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nhttp://www.theroot.com/more-black-women-are-realizing-that-the-democratic-part-1818650231\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean, however, that politics isn\u2019t dirty or that the electoral system isn\u2019t rigged\u2014voter suppression and gerrymandering already tell us that it is. The deal between Clinton and the DNC is simply political manipulation at its most insidious. If someone is invested in one candidate over the other, they will intentionally not see that or pretend that they don\u2019t.\n\nSo for Clinton supporters who vacillate between claiming she has done no wrong and is only viciously maligned because she\u2019s a woman to cheering her ability to play the game as dirty as any man: Let\u2019s play a game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s imagine for one moment that Sanders was the one with flush pockets. Let\u2019s say the DNC came to him for a handout to save it from itself and its futile quest to usher white supremacists with hearts of sparkling coal dust into the Democratic Party fold. Let\u2019s say Sanders agreed to share the wealth and, in return, he was allowed to control strategy and spending of the supposedly impartial party apparatus to the point where even press releases didn\u2019t go out without his camp\u2019s approval.\n\nUnless Donna Brazile is a bold-faced liar\u2014which so many Clinton supporters are now saying she is\u2014this is how it went down between Clinton and the DNC.\n\nIf that had happened, Clinton supporters would be calling for investigations and congressional hearings. Russia? What Russia? There would be rallies and marches. There would be charges of misogyny and collusion and unethical behavior. It would be a pink-pussy-hat extravaganza of extreme order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nInstead? Clinton supporters are frantically insisting that all but the most politically immature observers know that \u201cthis is how the system works\u201d and there\u2019s nothing to see here.\n\n\n\nAnd you know what? They\u2019re right. This is exactly how the system works. What Clinton and the DNC did by entering into their arrangement was not illegal. We all know that what is legal is often in direct conflict with what is just, fair and transparent. No, the problem here is not that the arrangement was illegal, but that it was completely legal.\n\nWe should ask ourselves why that is and whom exactly does it benefit.\n\nHillary Clinton is a sharp, skilled politician who knows the fine art of plausible deniability. Her supporters are quick to laud her experience, her deftness in navigating male-dominated waters and her tactical superiority. She saw an opportunity to tilt the scales in her favor and she did. She paid to play, and the Democratic Party mortgaged its already dubious claims of impartiality in exchange for money and connections. That is how the game is played. And for self-proclaimed pragmatic liberals to claim ignorance now is laughable.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA rigged system does not ensure that those in power win each time; it ensures that the status quo remains the same.\n\n\n\nJust as the truth of white supremacist police forces does not mean that every black child will be lynched by killers with badges; just as the truth that an education system that institutionalizes and criminalizes black and brown students to protect white power will not succeed in killing the intellectual fire in all black and brown students; just as the truth of mass incarceration does not mean that every single black person who lives in occupied communities will find themselves behind bars\u2014a political system rigged in favor of corporate cronyism, capitalism, patriarchy and white supremacy is still a system rigged in favor or corporate cronyism, capitalism, patriarchy and white supremacy, whether it succeeds in its mission in each instance or not.\n\nThis is not merely about Hillary Clinton winning the primary, or at least it shouldn\u2019t be. Bernie Sanders, who has continually shown his ingrained instincts to \u201cother\u201d black and brown people, is not a white savior. If he had won the primary and gone on to win the general election, it wouldn\u2019t have been simply because his populist message resonated so deeply among both millennials and people of color who understand that you can\u2019t have capitalism without racism. It wouldn\u2019t have been because he was once adjacent to the civil rights movement. Sanders\u2019 ability to make the so-called white working class comfortable in a way that Hillary Clinton could not is what would have given him the edge in swing states she lost.\n\nhttp://www.theroot.com/white-working-class-narrative-is-nothing-but-a-racist-1790857771\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat kind of negotiation with white supremacy should rightfully be placed under a microscope. It is why a political duopoly will never be in the best interests of freedom and liberation. The game is rigged no matter who is on the board, and it always has been.\n\nClinton knows it.\n\n\n\nSanders knows it.\n\n\n\nThe DNC and the RNC know it.\n\n\n\nTrump knows it.\n\n\n\nAnd if political cheerleaders would put down the pom-poms for their favorites, they would admit that they know it, too. It is simply a matter of whom it chooses to favor and what deal(s) with the devil(s) had to transpire for it to be so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know this much to be true: Instead of doubling down on duplicity, the Democratic Party better have a real reckoning\u2014and soon. Refusing to indict a system that\u2019s guilty as hell just to score political points means that we all lose, just as Dems will lose again in 2020 if they keep insulting the intelligence and doubting the determination of the people they claim to serve.\n\n\n\nCount on it.", "keywords": ["sanders", "supporters", "refusal", "democratic", "party", "liberal", "brazile", "dnc", "democracy", "socalled", "donna", "clinton", "campaign", "curious", "white", "admit", "case", "system", "rigged"], "polarity": 0.05053217288819383, "subjectivity": 0.43411268632472844},

Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) as saying that young black women have been jarred by the bigots in the White House because things were \u201cwell\u201d under President Barack Obama:\n\nRepresentative Sheila Jackson Lee, a Texas Democrat in the Congressional Black Caucus, addressed the news after the poll\u2019s release at the Washington Convention Center. \u201cI respect independents.

Somewhere between a black millennial and Gen Xer, he was someone who\u2019d worked on campaigns in Georgia and had a pretty good feel for what was going on throughout Atlanta and the surrounding suburbs.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat white boy \u2019bout to lose,\u201d was the first thing he said.\n\nAt first I was kind of surprised: Most polls showed the Georgia special election to be close, with Democrat Ossoff performing reasonably well and sometimes even leading Republican Karen Handel. It was the most expensive congressional race in history, and I knew several Republicans who told me privately that Ossoff was going to pull off the upset.\n\nHowever, with a few days on the ground and knowing the district, I expected Ossoff to lose in a close race, but hearing that sentiment from a campaign insider was unexpected. Yet it became a resounding theme, especially among the African-American political consultants and campaign insiders I spoke to. No matter what happened or how much money was spent, the racial dynamics of Georgia weren\u2019t going to let a Democrat win in a red district.\n\nDemocratic armchair quarterbacks were throwing pretzels long before Ossoff\u2019s 48 percent-to-52 percent loss to Handel was called on the cable news networks: The Democratic Party lacks a message; Jon Ossoff spent too much time talking about Trump; Jon Ossoff spent too little time talking about Trump; Jon Ossoff shoulda just kicked the field goal. Everyone seemed to know exactly what Atlanta Democrats should have done.\n\nThe truth is, the Republican Party had a 9 percent advantage in voter registration in the Georgia 6th. Hardworking local organizations got more than 129,000 people to early-vote, and more than 50,000 new voters registered between the April primary and the special election in June. But gerrymandering is a serious drug.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Georgia 6th was drawn in a way to guarantee that a ham sandwich, a wet tablecloth, Team Rocket or a Margo Martindale clone will win any race so long as they have an \u201cR\u201d by their name. There was no \u201cmessage\u201d from Ossoff on how he was going to turn college-educated Republicans into Democratic special election voters. There is no cheat code to make up a 9 percent registration deficit that either Bernie Sanders, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton or JFK could have come up with to change the election results. Privately, most Republicans in Atlanta will acknowledge that Ossoff ran about as flawless a campaign as possible, given the circumstances, but he couldn\u2019t overcome the structure of the district.\n\nThe Georgia special election demonstrates the limitations of the Democratic Party right now, as well as the weakness of the Republicans even in what are supposed to be safe districts. Republicans just spent $23 million to keep a congressional district that no Democrat has won in 40 years. That\u2019s like McDonald\u2019s spending millions to remind us they still sell hamburgers. If what you\u2019re selling is any good, you shouldn\u2019t have to spend that much to remind us.\n\nHowever, while some outside the district will second-guess and decry what happened in the race as some larger indictment of the Democratic Party, most African-American consultants on the ground were not surprised. When it came to the Georgia 6th special election, black folks knew that, like Airbnb rates and The Bachelorette, the fix was in.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhite people gonna white.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know my racist neighbors.\u201d\n\n\u201cOssoff left 10,000 black voters out there.\u201d\n\nIn the South\u2014even the \u201ceducated\u201d suburban South of a teeming multicultural metropolis like Atlanta\u2014racial dynamics and party dynamics overlap in inescapable ways. White people generally don\u2019t vote for the Democratic Party in Georgia, or any other Southern state. The idea that a coalition of educated suburban whites would actually team up with black voters to send a message to Donald Trump from Georgia was a fantasy created by the blue screen and CGI of outside Democratic analysts who want a happy ending to the Trump narrative in eight months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier in the week, a middle-aged white woman in a heavily pro-Ossoff precinct called the police on me for simply reporting on a group of African-American canvassers in her neighborhood. Canvassers were threatened and spat on across the 6th District. The Democratic Party\u2019s most reliable base of voters, African Americans remain the primary targets of voter intimidation, suppression and policy abuse, but the Democrats continue to spend millions of dollars chasing after mythical \u201cmoderate\u201d Republicans and soccer moms.\n\nThis is not to suggest that African-American turnout alone would have won the Georgia 6th for the Democrats, but they spent about $25 million in that race. For that much money, they could\u2019ve gotten one season out of LeBron James, and I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s equal to a 20 percent increase in black turnout.\n\nMany consultants told me that the Ossoff campaign left much of the black-turnout work to outside groups and third parties, which is status quo in a regular election, but that\u2019s not the game-changing strategy you need in the most expensive congressional race in American history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf there\u2019s any doubt about the value of tapping into the Southern black Democratic vote, just look at what happened six hours away in the South Carolina 5th District special election, which nobody was paying any attention to. There, quietly, the Democratic Party spent only $250,000 but tested out some experimental get-out-the-vote strategies for getting out the African-American vote.\n\nLook what happened:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemocrat Archie Parnell lost to Republican Ralph Norman by a mere 4 percentage points, 51 to 47 percent, in a district that went for Trump by 20 percentage points in November. What was the difference? Consistent and creative African-American turnout efforts by the Democratic candidate throughout the entire campaign led to\u2014wait for it\u2014incredible jumps in turnout! Politics can be a simple game when you actually target your own voters instead of someone else\u2019s.\n\nAt the end of the night, when all networks had declared that Jon Ossoff lost the Georgia 6th congressional race, the watch-party room was still jubilant. Black, white, Asian, Latino; the room was the epitome of Atlanta in 2017, if not specifically Georgia\u2019s 6th District. People were cheering, dancing and drinking long into the night. I only saw two people crying; everyone else was dancing to suburban hip-hop (lots of Usher and radio-edited T.I.; this is Atlanta, after all).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApparently they missed the message from national Democrats that they were a bunch of failures. But maybe, just like the black consultants I talked to all throughout the day, the Ossoff revelers knew something that nobody else did. Ossoff\u2019s supporters knew that they had raised millions of dollars and made the GOP sweat in places it never expected. African-American Democrats know that even amid the same old racial cleavages, the \u201cCity Too Busy to Hate\u201d had made a smidgen of progress in spite of itself.\n\nAll along, people knew \u201cThat white boy \u2019bout to lose,\u201d but at least this time, it looked as if he, and they, went down swinging.", "keywords": ["6th", "democratic", "election", "inescapable", "party", "district", "politics", "black", "racial", "boy", "bout", "ossoff", "ga", "race", "georgia", "white", "special", "lose", "africanamerican"], "polarity": 0.09281416283369413, "subjectivity": 0.39821211774336773},

Don\u2019t hate white people of this generation you fuck; we did\u2019nt do shit to you or your race. stop spewing hate. the fact you celebrated OJ\u2019s acquittal shows how dumb you are. karmas a bitch. really hope someone doesn\u2019t murder someone close to you. imagine that feeling you narcissistic fuck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is an example of our typical racist reader. Notice the lack of capitalization at the beginning of each sentence, something most people learn in their early elementary school years. While I am thankful for his hope that someone close to me isn\u2019t murdered, I question his use of a semicolon instead of a period. It could be a mistake, but when I combine that oversight with the fact that he misplaced an apostrophe in \u201cdidn\u2019t\u201d and just eliminated the one in \u201ckarma\u2019s,\u201d it shows how grammar has affected his mind state.\n\nNone of this indicates that the reader is dumb because\u2014wonder of wonders\u2014he didn\u2019t misspell \u201cnarcissistic.\u201d Plus, unlike some of our most racist readers, he didn\u2019t sprinkle ellipses throughout his message.\n\nNow let\u2019s take a look at a thread from a Twitter user who doesn\u2019t appear to be racist:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, Sarah, in her egalitarian white feminism, simply wanted to inject her narrative into an article that had nothing to do with her. She wanted to discuss sexism in an article that was specifically about police brutality and black lives. She wasn\u2019t necessarily being racist. She was exemplifying the white privilege that seeks to change every conversation and divert it to a subject she wants to talk about. As such, her only mistake (other than a comma instead of a semicolon after \u201cI understand you\u201d) was spelling \u201csay\u201d as \u201cday.\u201d\n\nSee ... not as racist, better grammar.\n\nAnd, finally, this:\n\nFrom: Edith\n\nTo: Michael Harriot I really enjoyed your article on OJ. I guess I\u2019m one of the few white Americans who really thought he was innocent. I recorded but haven\u2019t watched the Fox News interview but I will now very soon. I like to think that everyone judges people by their character and not the color of their skin but I know I\u2019m wrong. At 67 it is hard to understand why in this day and age color is still so harsh a feeling by some people. I grew up while the civil rights movement was in full force and saw the injustices that were going on in Selma. I guess I have spent my life wearing those 60\u2019s \u201cRose Colored Glasses\u201d but it was easier than reality.\n\nWe now have a man in the Oval Office (I refuse to call him President) who does nothing but preach hate belittles people. He is doing everything in his power to destroy all the good things that President Obama accomplished. I voted for President Obama twice and would have voted for him a third time if I could have had that privilege. I\u2019m praying constantly for impeachment but I\u2019m not sure it will happen.\n\nI work with black women that are some of the greatest women I\u2019ve ever had the privilege of knowing. We are all nurses and they are great. How anyone can judge a person by their color instead of their character is beyond my school of thought. Throughout my career as a nurse I have had the honor of taking care of many people of color that were amazing. I have heard of the difficulties of being black from the 1930\u2019s and onward. Some stories were absolutely fascinating while others just ripped your heart out. I can\u2019t imagine how black people felt with the way they were treated.\n\nI\u2019m also very proud that I have never treated anyone the way blacks have been treated. I think my parents had a great deal to do with that. I know you probably won\u2019t read all of this and I can\u2019t say I\u2019d blame you if you didn\u2019t but I wanted you to know there are some people out here who grew up in your parents or grandparents day that didn\u2019t grow up thinking they were better than people of color. My daddy use to tell my brother and me that \u201cthere was not one person in the world better than we were and there isn\u2019t one person in the world that we are better than anyone\u201d. I just know that if we remove our skin we all look the same.\n\nYou, Mr. Harriot, have managed to be the person that I elected to send my rants and raves at because of that dummy in the Oval Office, he is the one person that we are all better than. I get so angry at his actions I find myself hoping he will meet his Lee Harvey Oswald soon and I know that\u2019s not right.\n\nPlease know that believe it or not I don\u2019t write people like this but your writing was really great. I know you have probably turned blue at the length of some of my sentences but that\u2019s ok, you\u2019re right. Keep up the good work and please pray for a Democrat win EVERYWHERE.\n\nThanks for listening. God Bless.\n\nSincerely yours\n\nEdith\n\n\n\nNow, I\u2019m not trying to grammar-shame anyone, but this is from a white woman. Notice that\u2014instead of saying that she doesn\u2019t see color\u2014she acknowledges the fact that she can actually tell the difference between black women and everyone else!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot racist. Better grammar.\n\nGood looking out, Edith.\n\nThis week, News Editor Breanna Edwards rankled a legion of white people when she wrote an article about the sentient colostomy bag who smeared her bodily fluids all over her roommate\u2019s belongings and got off Scott-free.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI honestly can\u2019t explain why they were upset ... they just were. They weren\u2019t just mad ... they were big mad. Take this comment, for example:\n\nFrom: LT1990\n\nTo: Breanna Edwards Dont even have to read the article to know that it is written by a racist bitch. Just because that nasty bitch got off with little more than a warning, it doesn\u2019t mean it had anything to do with her race. STOP RACE BAITING!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s kinda racist. You will notice that the only egregious error is the lack of an apostrophe in \u201cdon\u2019t.\u201d But it gets worse:\n\nFrom: FUCKTHEOBAMAS\n\nTo: Breanna Edwards Author is a RACIST. CUNT AND A SLAG.\n\nSee how\u2014as he or she upped the racism ante\u2014the number of capital letters increased? And what\u2019s with the random period?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, I\u2019d like to point out that, for black people, \u201ccunt\u201d is not really a thing. I understand that it\u2019s one of the worst white insults, ranking second only to \u201cwhite people.\u201d Also, what is a slag? I\u2019m sure I could look it up, but I don\u2019t know if I want to know.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t think I want that in my Google search history.\n\nHere\u2019s another one:\n\nFrom: SNOWFLAKE\n\nTo: Breanna Edwards Just goes to show you your BL DON\u2019T MATTER any more than anyone elses. Your still 2nd class. Better yet NO CLASS THATS WHY YOU LIVE IN GHETTOS ITS WERE YOU BELONG.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCase closed.\n\nAnd finally, this series of comments on the article about cultural appropriation and Bruno Mars:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: borgohugis\n\nTo: Michael Harriot One of the other hallmarks of appropriation is using someone\u2019s culture to demean, make fun of or diminish it. It\u2019s demeaning when money is made from Black music but doesn\u2019t go to Black people. It\u2019s demeaning when Black music is used to gain influence and power to a person that is not Black. It\u2019s making fun of Black people when a non-Black person pretends and is a mockery of Black music, dance and culture. It diminishes the Black legacy because Black artists aren\u2019t getting awards for the Black music they create. This deprives us of historical records and credit. Michael, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on but a pattern is emerging. A black woman broke this shit down and you said \u201cnope\u201d. When Mo\u2019Nique broke the shit down, you said \u201cnope\u201d. Why is your response \u201cnope\u201d when your argument is as weak as \u201cOr maybe they\u2019re just tired of seeing Bruno Mars\u201d. Wut?? You see fit to use your aunties as proof of Blackness but you are never here supporting the words of Black women. This shit is fucked up and you need to start thinking about what and who you are trying to support. If it isn\u2019t the words of Black women then I don\u2019t even know why you see fit to write anything especially something as weak as this. Bills must be paid and clicks must be had but damn do you really have to do it at the expense of Black women who are speaking truth?\n\nFrom: Kalx\n\nTo: borgohugis Thank you for saying this. I\u2019ve been noticing that I disagree with Michael\u2019s takes 87% of the time. It\u2019s mind numbing at this point. He\u2019s a lot like Charlemagne the Charlatan.\n\nFrom: borgohugis To: Kalx When he round about defended Charlemagne was egregious enough. Also the writing is so weak. He tries to wrap up the header in the last paragraph with the flimsiest reason after spending half the article giving evidence that goes against his argument.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest borgohugis and Kalx,\n\nI could tell you that I am the least sexist person I know and that I don\u2019t see gender. I could easily dismiss your criticism by saying that some of my best friends are black women (actually, just three; but three count as \u201csome,\u201d right?).\n\nInstead of rejecting your comments out of hand, I did what I wish some white readers would do. I examined myself and what you call \u201ca pattern\u201d that is emerging in my work. I didn\u2019t just examine myself; I examined my content. Here\u2019s what I found:\n\nIn 2018, I have written 148 stories for The Root. Twenty-five of those stories were about, or had something to do with, black women. Here is the list of black women I said \u201cnope\u201d to:\n\nSeren Sensai: Although I disagree with you on characterizing what I said as \u201cnope.\u201d I specifically said she \u201cmakes a convincing argument breaking down why Mars is a derivative artist,\u201d and that \u201cEvery single word Sensei said was correct, but none of it defined cultural appropriation.\u201d If you disagree on my interpretation, that is fine, but you should know that this article was sparked by my hearing the argument from men and women about cultural appropriation.\n\n\n\nAlthough I disagree with you on characterizing what I said as \u201cnope.\u201d I specifically said she \u201cmakes a convincing argument breaking down why Mars is a derivative artist,\u201d and that \u201cEvery single word Sensei said was correct, but none of it defined cultural appropriation.\u201d If you disagree on my interpretation, that is fine, but you should know that this article was sparked by my hearing the argument from men and women about cultural appropriation. Omarosa Manigault Newman: I admit that I wholeheartedly disagree with almost everything she does. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.\n\nI admit that I wholeheartedly disagree with almost everything she does. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.

Karima Garner: A black woman whose actions I vehemently disagreed with ... only because she killed another woman by injecting her booty with Home Depot silicone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the list.\n\nNotice that list does not include Mo\u2019Nique because when the \u201cboycott Netflix\u201d debate emerged, I was one of the first writers not only to defend her position but also to attempt to dissect it using the history and economics of Hollywood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven in the article you pointed out, I concluded:\n\nI wish I had Mo\u2019Nique\u2019s level of confidence and self-value. The idea that others cannot determine the value of your work is an important lesson. Maybe she should treat people better. Maybe she isn\u2019t as funny or as popular as she and her \u201cDaddy\u201d believes (I feel like I should put my name on the sex offender\u2019s registry every time I type that), but her willingness to say \u201cFuck your couch\u201d and stand on principle is admirable. Mo\u2019Nique is right. Black is often devalued because it is black. Women are often lowballed because they are women. It is difficult to live in that reality and reject it as a reason that she believes Netflix undervalued her. Even if she is wrong about Netflix, her larger point is also correct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t object to your characterization of my argument, even if you feel like I sided with \u201cCharlemagne the Charlatan\u201d or didn\u2019t castigate him enough. Maybe I didn\u2019t write it well enough or left it open to interpretation. Perhaps I was too evenhanded. I can accept that. I find it interesting that you think I dismissed Mo\u2019Nique while other readers thought I sided with Mo\u2019Nique too much.\n\nIn fact, one particular reader disliked my initial commentary so much that he called to explain his viewpoint as soon as the article appeared. I can\u2019t reveal our conversation, but let\u2019s just say he is a high-ranking executive for a company that rhymes with \u201cMetflix.\u201d\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t dismiss your criticism. If either of you feels that I am dismissive of black women or that I am wrong 87 percent of the time, I invite you to skip my byline. I can\u2019t imagine reading someone whose writing was \u201cso weak\u201d and was so wrong so often.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is my job to examine and critique race and culture. I try not to be too thin-skinned to accept the backlash or to ignore those who are critical of me. But Kalyx and borgohugis, I must admit that your comments made me rethink a lot of my prejudices for one reason:\n\nYour grammar was impeccable.", "keywords": ["clapback", "solved", "roots", "racism", "article", "racist", "think", "dont", "mailbag", "know", "didnt", "better", "women", "person", "black", "white"], "polarity": 0.03708051930708181, "subjectivity": 0.49681022102897116},

The Democratic Party is saying, \u201cI told y\u2019all.\u201d The pundits are giving the entire state of Alabama the credit. Even mainstream media has decided who was most responsible for Doug Jones\u2019 victory over the John Wayne of alleged pedophiles:\n\nYep, according to everyone, \u201cwomen\u201d are the ones who pushed Doug Jones\u2019 campaign for U.S. Senate over the finish line. Not black women. Not even black people. Just women.\n\nBut mostly white women.\n\nAccording to the punditry class, Jones\u2019 victory happened because of all women, including white women. Even though, according to the Washington Post, 63 percent of white women voted for Roy Moore, white women still received credit for the Jones victory. They were the heroes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack women got their shoutouts, and so did black men, but no one dared leave out white women. Although there is no statistical or logical reason to think that white women helped Doug Jones vanquish his opponent, they somehow came down on the right side of history. NBC News whitesplained it this way:\n\nFifty-eight percent of Alabama women voted for the winner, Democrat Doug Jones, including 35 percent of white women, according to exit polling. While that latter figure might not sound like much, it\u2019s more than twice the 16 percent of white Alabama women who voted for President Barack Obama in 2012, the last presidential race in which exit polling was conducted.\n\nWhat. The. Entire. Fuck.\n\nI know some people bristle at the idea that the benefit of whiteness is baked into every molecule of American existence, but the previous paragraph should be included in the dictionary alongside the phrase \u201cwhite privilege.\u201d Imagine taking an exam in front of the entire country, getting 63 percent of the answers wrong and\u2014not only do you pass the test\u2014but you are called to come to the front of the entire class so the professor can pat you on the back!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut wait ... there\u2019s more.\n\nThen there was the venerable political reporter Beth Clayton, who became the mouthpiece of the white-woman savior class. Immediately following the election, Clayton appeared on MSNBC to explain how white women had saved the world. She tied the election to the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment scandal and the #MeToo movement (started by a black woman). She proudly explained to Chris Hayes:\n\nWhen you look at women in across Alabama or in any corner of the United States, we\u2019ve all been in a situation where a man didn\u2019t treat us right, and we know that feeling. And we know how it feels to not be believed. And we showed up and we said, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to tolerate it.\u201d And it helps that, looking across the country, women were beginning to be believed in all corners of America. And they felt confident coming out here in Alabama where, frankly, we frankly don\u2019t have a lot of room to wiggle here. And women came out, and we said, \u201cNo more.\u201d and frankly, no more. We deserve better than this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI doubt she meant it in the way it came off, which is exactly why this Caucaplanation rubbed me the wrong way as soon as I saw it.\n\nWho the hell is \u201cwe\u201d? Clayton must have some black women in her purse, because \u201cwe\u201d didn\u2019t do a damn thing. The vast majority of white \u201cwe\u2019s\u201d voted for the other guy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack people are 26 percent of the population in Alabama, but the Washington Post says they were 29 percent of Tuesday\u2019s electorate. Conversely, whites are 68 percent of Alabama\u2019s population, yet only 66 percent voted in Alabama\u2019s Senate race.\n\nLet\u2019s put it this way: Using AL.com\u2019s raw vote totals and the Washington Post\u2019s exit polls, if all the women in the state assembled themselves and each of Jones\u2019 black female supporters stood beside a white woman who voted for him, there would still be 82,278 black women standing by themselves wondering, \u201cWhere the white women at?\u201d\n\n\n\nNow, explain to me, again, who \u201cshowed up.\u201d\n\nNot white women. That is a fact. Again ... numbers.\n\nWhite women are used to that. They get a privilege no one else in the world enjoys. They get to rail against the white male patriarchy while forgetting the pale crooked fingers that pointed the lynchers in the direction of Emmett Till or the mob that burned down Black Wall Street. They get to decry affirmative action while benefiting from it. They get the front page of Time magazine for changing the country\u2019s attitude about sexual assault while never mentioning the black woman who started the whole thing. They get to scream, \u201cBelieve all women\u201d while simultaneously calling Aurora Perrineau a goddamn liar when she says she was raped by their white friend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe caveat of \u201cFewer white women supported Moore than supported Trump\u201d is a stupid reason to include white women among the reasons for why the molesting equestrian lost his bid for office. Saying that white women helped Moore win is like saying the Golden State Warriors won their first NBA championship because of Festus Ezeli. And I know you\u2019re wondering: \u201cWho the hell is Festus Ezeli? Did he even get in the game?\u201d\n\n\n\nExactly.\n\nYet they are proudly parading around, poking out their chests, proclaiming, \u201cWe did it.\u201d No one is saying white women didn\u2019t contribute. No one would even say they didn\u2019t work hard. They get to share the championship because they were on the team that scored the most points. But they don\u2019t get to act like they\u2019re they most valuable players.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s be clear:\n\nBlack women are the MVPs.\n\nWhite women will tell you that all women are beautiful, delicate creatures who deserve to be protected, appreciated and placed on a pedestal. They say anyone who doesn\u2019t honor all women should be reviled. But they will vote for a pussy grabber. They will cast votes for a child molester.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen they say \u201cMe too,\u201d notice the subtle emphasis on the \u201cme\u201d part. The \u201ctoo\u201d is just to make sure they will be included in the victory celebration. Even when they fail the test.

Kelly (not to be confused with the other Best of Both Worlds tour with Hannah and Miley).\n\nThe king of R&B and Hov together, on one stage. What could go wrong?\n\nWell, just about everything.\n\nThe 40-city tour only lasted about two months. Pettiness, infighting and leaks ended with Jigga literally yelling, \u201cI don\u2019t need that nigga\u201d to a Madison Square Garden crowd and finishing the tour sans Kellz. Just because it seemed like a good idea didn\u2019t mean that the Best of Both Worlds tour needed to happen.\n\nIn yet another example of the Democratic Party mimicking but not learning from black people, it launched its own Best of Both Worlds \u201cUnity\u201d tour featuring new Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez and Bernie Sanders. It was supposed to feature the two major wings of the party coming together to resurrect Democrats in the age of Trump. Instead, it\u2019s been a PR and organizational flop. The DNC can\u2019t quite say, \u201cI don\u2019t need this nigga\u201d to Bernie Sanders, but the feeling is getting close.\n\n\n\nThere was tension from the very beginning of the tour, both ideologically and otherwise. Tom Perez was just elected DNC chair this year over Keith Ellison, whom Sanders had endorsed. Perez and Sanders\u2019 obsession with appealing to working-class white men (over the actual coalition of black women, minorities, young people and city residents that gave Hillary Clinton the majority of the popular vote) has rubbed many grassroots activists the wrong way.\n\nLastly, the weeklong tour went to Texas, Nebraska, Kentucky, Arizona, Florida, Utah and Nevada, mostly deep-red states that don\u2019t have a growing or even nominal coalition of Democratic supporters. Activists in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, states that flipped from blue to red, in large part due to voter suppression, felt snubbed as Perez and Sanders chased MAGA hats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis tension between the speakers, the party and the grassroots boiled over to the surface, and the tour became defined more as a battle of Bernie vs. the Democrats than anything else.\n\n\u201cBernie didn\u2019t even have to do this,\u201d said Marcus Ferrell, former head of African-American outreach for the Sanders presidential campaign.\n\nFerrell points out that the ego and policy battle between the Democratic National Committee and Bernie Sanders is taking up all the headlines and discussion. This while the policies, especially those that focus on the needs of the black community, are being ignored by both sides.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[Bernie] still has work to do on race and class issues,\u201d Ferrell said. \u201cI\u2019m ready and willing to admit that; but on the same token, we have much bigger fish to fry than a battle of Bernie vs. Democrats.\u201d\n\nThere is truth to this.\n\nRather than trying to show unity while still fighting backstage, Democrats could do a lot more to thank and support African-American voters, especially the 94 percent of black women who voted to save the world from Donald Trump. Hire more African-American women as staffers, go stump for more minority candidates, put more money into fighting voter suppression, or, better yet, state in the party platform that \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d: These are all things that could have made the Unity tour more substantive and reflective of the party\u2019s base.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut none of those things will be addressed until the egos and feelings from the primary are in check. Perez wants to get his hands on Sanders\u2019 supporters and mailing lists but doesn\u2019t want to really include the Sanders wing\u2019s policies or leadership in the rebuilding of the DNC. Democrats are angry at Sanders for callously hijacking the party, then declaring in an interview (while sitting next to Perez) that he wasn\u2019t a Democrat. His \u201ceconomics over race\u201d rhetoric has always annoyed long-term black Democrats who feel that Sanders is an opportunist. To them, Bernie Sanders is like the white sorority that forces its way into the step show, wins third place, then refuses to donate some of the prize money to the MLK awards dinner.\n\nThe consequences of this failed tour are already being felt across actual Democratic races around the country. Sanders came out stomping hard for Heath Mello, a Democratic mayoral candidate for Omaha, Neb., despite the candidate\u2019s pro-life stances. Then the DNC chair called Sanders out for his stance, then Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called out Perez and then Sanders told them all that you have to make ideological compromises to win. This coming from the same Bernie Sanders who screams, \u201cYou shall not pass\u201d to any Democrat who isn\u2019t progressive enough for his tastes\u2014despite not being a Democrat. You\u2019d think the Dems would have worked these things out before going on tour.\n\nThe Unity tour ended this week, and the Democrats haven\u2019t solved their Bernie problem, their DNC problem, their black problem or their \u201cunity\u201d problem. If there is a solution out there, maybe it can be taken from the last night of that failed concert tour in 2004.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nR. Kelly had a meltdown and ran off the stage at New York City\u2019s Madison Square Garden halfway through his set, leaving the whole show in the lurch. At this point, Jay Z had enough, he went onstage, made his proclamation and got on with the show with other artists who were ready to play. When R.

It started with the election of President Barack Obama, who invented racism in a Kenyan laboratory with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Saul Alinsky and that terrorist dude from the Weather Underground. (I know his name is Bill Ayers. I\u2019m just using his white-people name.)\n\nEver since Obama released this terrible plague into our society, people much smarter than I have been trying to solve the racism riddle and banish it from the planet. They\u2019ve tried sensitivity training, revising history to make the Civil War about states\u2019 rights and\u2014most notably\u2014developing an antidote called \u201creverse racism.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the scientists here at The Root have finally figured out a cure. Our researchers ran our most racist emails, tweets, comments and direct messages through our proprietary software and analyzed the results. They detected a pattern that shows racism is inversely proportional to the ability to spell, capitalize and punctuate.\n\nYes, the cure for racism is grammar lessons.\n\nToday we share our peer-reviewed study. (Although, to be fair, Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan does not consider me her peer.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: Wait .. I thought you said \u2018pear.\u2019 No, I don\u2019t consider you my pear. \u2014Yesha]\n\n(Sidenote: Instead of including our positive emails at the end, this week they will be used as control subjects for our data comparisons.)\n\nHere are our results:\n\nIn our first test case, we examined the responses to our article on O.J. Simpson:\n\nFrom: Connor\n\nTo: Michael Harriot you are such a smug racist spewing piece of shit. Don\u2019t hate white people of this generation you fuck; we did\u2019nt do shit to you or your race. stop spewing hate. the fact you celebrated OJ\u2019s acquittal shows how dumb you are. karmas a bitch. really hope someone doesn\u2019t murder someone close to you. imagine that feeling you narcissistic fuck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is an example of our typical racist reader. Notice the lack of capitalization at the beginning of each sentence, something most people learn in their early elementary school years. While I am thankful for his hope that someone close to me isn\u2019t murdered, I question his use of a semicolon instead of a period. It could be a mistake, but when I combine that oversight with the fact that he misplaced an apostrophe in \u201cdidn\u2019t\u201d and just eliminated the one in \u201ckarma\u2019s,\u201d it shows how grammar has affected his mind state.\n\nNone of this indicates that the reader is dumb because\u2014wonder of wonders\u2014he didn\u2019t misspell \u201cnarcissistic.\u201d Plus, unlike some of our most racist readers, he didn\u2019t sprinkle ellipses throughout his message.\n\nNow let\u2019s take a look at a thread from a Twitter user who doesn\u2019t appear to be racist:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, Sarah, in her egalitarian white feminism, simply wanted to inject her narrative into an article that had nothing to do with her. She wanted to discuss sexism in an article that was specifically about police brutality and black lives. She wasn\u2019t necessarily being racist. She was exemplifying the white privilege that seeks to change every conversation and divert it to a subject she wants to talk about. As such, her only mistake (other than a comma instead of a semicolon after \u201cI understand you\u201d) was spelling \u201csay\u201d as \u201cday.\u201d\n\nSee ... not as racist, better grammar.\n\nAnd, finally, this:\n\nFrom: Edith\n\nTo: Michael Harriot I really enjoyed your article on OJ. I guess I\u2019m one of the few white Americans who really thought he was innocent. I recorded but haven\u2019t watched the Fox News interview but I will now very soon. I like to think that everyone judges people by their character and not the color of their skin but I know I\u2019m wrong. At 67 it is hard to understand why in this day and age color is still so harsh a feeling by some people. I grew up while the civil rights movement was in full force and saw the injustices that were going on in Selma. I guess I have spent my life wearing those 60\u2019s \u201cRose Colored Glasses\u201d but it was easier than reality.\n\nWe now have a man in the Oval Office (I refuse to call him President) who does nothing but preach hate belittles people. He is doing everything in his power to destroy all the good things that President Obama accomplished. I voted for President Obama twice and would have voted for him a third time if I could have had that privilege. I\u2019m praying constantly for impeachment but I\u2019m not sure it will happen.\n\nI work with black women that are some of the greatest women I\u2019ve ever had the privilege of knowing. We are all nurses and they are great. How anyone can judge a person by their color instead of their character is beyond my school of thought. Throughout my career as a nurse I have had the honor of taking care of many people of color that were amazing. I have heard of the difficulties of being black from the 1930\u2019s and onward. Some stories were absolutely fascinating while others just ripped your heart out. I can\u2019t imagine how black people felt with the way they were treated.\n\nI\u2019m also very proud that I have never treated anyone the way blacks have been treated. I think my parents had a great deal to do with that. I know you probably won\u2019t read all of this and I can\u2019t say I\u2019d blame you if you didn\u2019t but I wanted you to know there are some people out here who grew up in your parents or grandparents day that didn\u2019t grow up thinking they were better than people of color. My daddy use to tell my brother and me that \u201cthere was not one person in the world better than we were and there isn\u2019t one person in the world that we are better than anyone\u201d. I just know that if we remove our skin we all look the same.\n\nYou, Mr. Harriot, have managed to be the person that I elected to send my rants and raves at because of that dummy in the Oval Office, he is the one person that we are all better than. I get so angry at his actions I find myself hoping he will meet his Lee Harvey Oswald soon and I know that\u2019s not right.\n\nPlease know that believe it or not I don\u2019t write people like this but your writing was really great. I know you have probably turned blue at the length of some of my sentences but that\u2019s ok, you\u2019re right. Keep up the good work and please pray for a Democrat win EVERYWHERE.\n\nThanks for listening. God Bless.\n\nSincerely yours\n\nEdith\n\n\n\nNow, I\u2019m not trying to grammar-shame anyone, but this is from a white woman. Notice that\u2014instead of saying that she doesn\u2019t see color\u2014she acknowledges the fact that she can actually tell the difference between black women and everyone else!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot racist. Better grammar.\n\nGood looking out, Edith.\n\nThis week, News Editor Breanna Edwards rankled a legion of white people when she wrote an article about the sentient colostomy bag who smeared her bodily fluids all over her roommate\u2019s belongings and got off Scott-free.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI honestly can\u2019t explain why they were upset ... they just were. They weren\u2019t just mad ... they were big mad. Take this comment, for example:\n\nFrom: LT1990\n\nTo: Breanna Edwards Dont even have to read the article to know that it is written by a racist bitch. Just because that nasty bitch got off with little more than a warning, it doesn\u2019t mean it had anything to do with her race. STOP RACE BAITING!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s kinda racist. You will notice that the only egregious error is the lack of an apostrophe in \u201cdon\u2019t.\u201d But it gets worse:\n\nFrom: FUCKTHEOBAMAS\n\nTo: Breanna Edwards Author is a RACIST. CUNT AND A SLAG.\n\nSee how\u2014as he or she upped the racism ante\u2014the number of capital letters increased? And what\u2019s with the random period?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, I\u2019d like to point out that, for black people, \u201ccunt\u201d is not really a thing. I understand that it\u2019s one of the worst white insults, ranking second only to \u201cwhite people.\u201d Also, what is a slag? I\u2019m sure I could look it up, but I don\u2019t know if I want to know.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t think I want that in my Google search history.\n\nHere\u2019s another one:\n\nFrom: SNOWFLAKE\n\nTo: Breanna Edwards Just goes to show you your BL DON\u2019T MATTER any more than anyone elses. Your still 2nd class. Better yet NO CLASS THATS WHY YOU LIVE IN GHETTOS ITS WERE YOU BELONG.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCase closed.\n\nAnd finally, this series of comments on the article about cultural appropriation and Bruno Mars:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: borgohugis\n\nTo: Michael Harriot One of the other hallmarks of appropriation is using someone\u2019s culture to demean, make fun of or diminish it. It\u2019s demeaning when money is made from Black music but doesn\u2019t go to Black people. It\u2019s demeaning when Black music is used to gain influence and power to a person that is not Black. It\u2019s making fun of Black people when a non-Black person pretends and is a mockery of Black music, dance and culture. It diminishes the Black legacy because Black artists aren\u2019t getting awards for the Black music they create. This deprives us of historical records and credit. Michael, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on but a pattern is emerging. A black woman broke this shit down and you said \u201cnope\u201d. When Mo\u2019Nique broke the shit down, you said \u201cnope\u201d. Why is your response \u201cnope\u201d when your argument is as weak as \u201cOr maybe they\u2019re just tired of seeing Bruno Mars\u201d. Wut?? You see fit to use your aunties as proof of Blackness but you are never here supporting the words of Black women. This shit is fucked up and you need to start thinking about what and who you are trying to support. If it isn\u2019t the words of Black women then I don\u2019t even know why you see fit to write anything especially something as weak as this. Bills must be paid and clicks must be had but damn do you really have to do it at the expense of Black women who are speaking truth?\n\nFrom: Kalx\n\nTo: borgohugis Thank you for saying this. I\u2019ve been noticing that I disagree with Michael\u2019s takes 87% of the time. It\u2019s mind numbing at this point. He\u2019s a lot like Charlemagne the Charlatan.\n\nFrom: borgohugis To: Kalx When he round about defended Charlemagne was egregious enough. Also the writing is so weak. He tries to wrap up the header in the last paragraph with the flimsiest reason after spending half the article giving evidence that goes against his argument.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest borgohugis and Kalx,\n\nI could tell you that I am the least sexist person I know and that I don\u2019t see gender. I could easily dismiss your criticism by saying that some of my best friends are black women (actually, just three; but three count as \u201csome,\u201d right?).\n\nInstead of rejecting your comments out of hand, I did what I wish some white readers would do. I examined myself and what you call \u201ca pattern\u201d that is emerging in my work. I didn\u2019t just examine myself; I examined my content. Here\u2019s what I found:\n\nIn 2018, I have written 148 stories for The Root. Twenty-five of those stories were about, or had something to do with, black women. Here is the list of black women I said \u201cnope\u201d to:\n\nSeren Sensai: Although I disagree with you on characterizing what I said as \u201cnope.\u201d I specifically said she \u201cmakes a convincing argument breaking down why Mars is a derivative artist,\u201d and that \u201cEvery single word Sensei said was correct, but none of it defined cultural appropriation.\u201d If you disagree on my interpretation, that is fine, but you should know that this article was sparked by my hearing the argument from men and women about cultural appropriation.\n\n\n\nAlthough I disagree with you on characterizing what I said as \u201cnope.\u201d I specifically said she \u201cmakes a convincing argument breaking down why Mars is a derivative artist,\u201d and that \u201cEvery single word Sensei said was correct, but none of it defined cultural appropriation.\u201d If you disagree on my interpretation, that is fine, but you should know that this article was sparked by my hearing the argument from men and women about cultural appropriation. Omarosa Manigault Newman: I admit that I wholeheartedly disagree with almost everything she does. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.\n\nI admit that I wholeheartedly disagree with almost everything she does. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. Priyanka Banks : A reality-TV star actress who sued her sorority for kicking her out of Delta Sigma Theta.\n\nA reality-TV actress who sued her sorority for kicking her out of Delta Sigma Theta. Karima Garner: A black woman whose actions I vehemently disagreed with ... only because she killed another woman by injecting her booty with Home Depot silicone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the list.\n\nNotice that list does not include Mo\u2019Nique because when the \u201cboycott Netflix\u201d debate emerged, I was one of the first writers not only to defend her position but also to attempt to dissect it using the history and economics of Hollywood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven in the article you pointed out, I concluded:\n\nI wish I had Mo\u2019Nique\u2019s level of confidence and self-value. The idea that others cannot determine the value of your work is an important lesson. Maybe she should treat people better. Maybe she isn\u2019t as funny or as popular as she and her \u201cDaddy\u201d believes (I feel like I should put my name on the sex offender\u2019s registry every time I type that), but her willingness to say \u201cFuck your couch\u201d and stand on principle is admirable. Mo\u2019Nique is right. Black is often devalued because it is black. Women are often lowballed because they are women. It is difficult to live in that reality and reject it as a reason that she believes Netflix undervalued her. Even if she is wrong about Netflix, her larger point is also correct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t object to your characterization of my argument, even if you feel like I sided with \u201cCharlemagne the Charlatan\u201d or didn\u2019t castigate him enough. Maybe I didn\u2019t write it well enough or left it open to interpretation. Perhaps I was too evenhanded. I can accept that. I find it interesting that you think I dismissed Mo\u2019Nique while other readers thought I sided with Mo\u2019Nique too much.\n\nIn fact, one particular reader disliked my initial commentary so much that he called to explain his viewpoint as soon as the article appeared. I can\u2019t reveal our conversation, but let\u2019s just say he is a high-ranking executive for a company that rhymes with \u201cMetflix.\u201d\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t dismiss your criticism. If either of you feels that I am dismissive of black women or that I am wrong 87 percent of the time, I invite you to skip my byline. I can\u2019t imagine reading someone whose writing was \u201cso weak\u201d and was so wrong so often.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is my job to examine and critique race and culture. I try not to be too thin-skinned to accept the backlash or to ignore those who are critical of me. But Kalyx and borgohugis, I must admit that your comments made me rethink a lot of my prejudices for one reason:\n\nYour grammar was impeccable.", "keywords": ["clapback", "solved", "roots", "racism", "article", "racist", "think", "dont", "mailbag", "know", "didnt", "better", "women", "person", "black", "white"], "polarity": 0.03708051930708181, "subjectivity": 0.49681022102897116},

I was entertained by your writing and found myself laughing out loud a few times. I genuinely like your style of writing and will continue to read your pieces. But, as I read further into this piece I found myself getting more and more confused by your message. There was some obvious hate directed towards white people. I am a \u201cChad.\u201d I\u2019m about as Chad as they get. Like you, a Jamal, I had only one friend who was not like me. My one black friend, Tim, was the only black kid in our school. I can vividly recall the first time I knew he was different. It\u2019s when my Dad saw him and asked if there were other black kids at my school. That one question changed everything. It made me aware that Tim was supposedly different. Parents teach their kids when they don\u2019t even know it. As someone who considers themselves not racist, I teach my kids how to not be racist, prejudice, or an asshole by not acknowledging the difference in someone who is not white, heterosexual, or different in any way. If I were to point out their differences, it would be, at the very least, condescending. And I\u2019d be doing the same thing my Dad did to me, perpetuating prejudice. Its very frustrating to read about a generalization about white people and how they feel about black people. Why can\u2019t I read your column and just be entertained? Why do I have be lumped into a small group of people or made to feel ashamed or embarrassed to be white? I hate being hated for no reason. I realize that is exactly how you must feel. And that is how you very subtlely came accross. I\u2019m aware enough to know I\u2019m missing something. I\u2019m interested in hearing your take on this because I feel like you can honestly enlighten me as to why you feel the way you do about white people. And why you feel it\u2019s okay to generalize and lump us altogether. I challenge you to respond without bringing up what our shitty forefather\u2019s did, what previous generations did, or what you\u2019ve been told to believe. I want to hear what you have personally seen and experienced that makes you so comfortable in perpetuating prejudices. Thanks, Greg\n\nDearest Greg:\n\nFirst, I want to sincerely let you know that I am sorry that you are ashamed or embarrassed about your race. Unlike you, I honestly believe it\u2019s OK to be white.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a \u201cJamaal\u201d (you spelled it wrong, but that\u2019s OK), I also want to congratulate you for having one black friend way back in elementary school. On behalf of our entire Jamaal population, I offer our collective thanks for your charitable willingness to befriend someone who is black and to be so accepting of diversity that you remember the one black guy you rescued from the wild so many years ago. It moves me to tears every time I hear a heartwarming story like yours about how you were willing to adopt a Jamaal during your youth.\n\nAs for your challenge for me to respond without bringing up something your shitty forefathers did (again, you spelled it wrong; there was no need for that random apostrophe), I need some clarification on the matter.\n\nWould your dad be considered a \u201cforefather\u201d when he pointed out the race of your pet Tim? Because if parents teach their kids without even knowing it, as you claim, then it is obvious that yours taught you well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here is what I am trying to get at, Greg/Chad.\n\nYou cannot write me letters insinuating that I perpetuate racism against white people that permeates society and infects future generations while simultaneously asking why I am lumping you in with the fucked-up people who came before you. If one Jamaal like me can somehow make black people hate white people, then imagine the effect of an entire nation of Jamaals.\n\nImagine if, instead of writing on the internet, we Jamaals did this for the next four centuries: passing our hate down to our children. Imagine if we had Jamaal-only neighborhoods and caged the Chads into certain areas with underfunded schools and endemic poverty. Imagine if we threw job applications into the trash if they had the name Chad or Becky on them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only that, but what if every person named Jamaal benefited from the simple happenstance that they were named Jamaal? What if anyone named Jamaal could live anywhere they wanted, do whatever they wished and didn\u2019t have to worry about the random pitfalls of society because their name provided them immunity and privilege?\n\n\n\nAnd then one day, one of them overheard someone named Tim ...\n\nOr Chad ...\n\nOr Michael Harriot, telling people about the Jamaals.\n\nAnd after benefiting from being named Jamaal for a quadruple century, Jamaal sat down at his desk and typed a letter explaining how he lived in such privileged isolation from everyone else that he remembered the exact motherfucking day, time and year when he first encountered one of those poor, non-Jamaal savages, and took it in like a pet hamster, finally realizing that he lived in a Jamaal-based society.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow imagine, if you will, after all of that, this douchebag had stored up so much entitlement that he had the Jamaal-dacity to say to someone ... anyone:\n\n\u201cI heard what you said and I\u2019m offended. Now explain why you feel like that without mentioning anyone named Jamaal.\u201d\n\nJamaal, please.\n\nThis next letter is regarding the little girl who saw former first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s portrait and thought she was a queen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: j40oaks\n\nTo: Anne Branigin\n\nSubject: Oh ....

Your embrace of lowercase letters shows growth (we\u2019re still working on the ellipses, but that\u2019s a lesson you learn in sixth-grade grammar; you\u2019ll get there), but what I\u2019d like to know is:\n\nWhy are you like this?\n\nWho hurt you, j40? Did a black guy steal your college sweetheart? Were you cut from your middle school basketball team and replaced by a Negro with a superior vertical leap?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI want to applaud you for your candor, and for the fact that you embrace your racism. The majority of our hate mail includes the caveat \u201cI\u2019m not racist,\u201d but not yours, j40. I appreciate the fact that despite your obviously low IQ, your inability to dribble and being saddled with the gut-wrenching memory of watching Amber pose for prom pictures with DeMarcus, you know who you are: an unapologetic bigot.\n\nI recognize your hate for Michelle Obama. I know she didn\u2019t sign a single piece of legislation, have any role in governing or affect your life in any measurable way. I understand that it is her blackness that offends you (what else could it be?). The fact that a little girl could admire someone black must really eat away at your nerves.\n\nI have instructed Anne to stop destroying our country with this bullshit because\u2014even though the \u201cmillennial cupcakes\u201d appreciate positive stories\u2014I see now that you can\u2019t handle it. She will do better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this one, about ... something:\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nFrom: David\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Repent Michael you are a person of the baser sort who is so full of hatred and ungodliness that you cannot even think clearly. Your articles are so vile and disgusting and you are so full of yourself that you cannot even have any other thoughts than the ones you deceive yourself into thinking you are always right. You will have your judgement day and, as you kneel before the Lord Jesus Christ on that day, you will realize how foolish you were. It is not to late to repent, but I think you will only mock me and what I have written to you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I thanked him for his letter, he wrote back:\n\nI got to you I see and I am glad. You need to repent Michael and all those Lily white liberals who are falling all over themselves to praise you also need to repent. You have a lot of people who are so in love with you or else they feel so guilty about their deep seated prejudices towards black people that they are so afraid of offending you else they fear they may be found our. It is sickening to read all of these fawners and you eat it up with a spoon. I speak truth to you Michael and I am no bigot. I have lived around all kinds of people all if my life and I can spot a phony when I see one, of which you are. You have deep seated hatred in your heart for white folks and you don\u2019t sound as though you really know any. You disparage President Trump without even knowing what he is trying to do, and yet you give a pass to the last one who was in office and did nothing good for the black Americans who live in the inner cities. Eight years and he only did terrible corrupt things. He was more concerned about men being able to go into girls bathrooms. Ask the black Americans who live in Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore and other inner cities and ask them what he did for them. Nothing at all. Bring in anyone from any country and support them, but turn your back on our citizens. That is what he did. Hucksters like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson he loves. Also terrorists are his friends, but not Americans. Our new president is trying to put Americans first, or can\u2019t you see that Michael? You need to seek the truth because the truth is the only thing that will set you free. Jesus said that.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlease allow me to pray with you.\n\n\n\nDear White Jesus:\n\nI come to you, Lord, not only on my behalf, but on behalf of all my people who don\u2019t know how President Trump is saving this country. We ask you right now for your forgiveness, Lord.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForgive us for offending David, precious Caucasian savior. I know you said \u201cthe truth will set you free,\u201d which is why we are probably in this predicament right now, untanned Father. But now I finally see the light of your brave prophets, like David, who are out here fighting the good fight, alabaster Jesus. I trust him when he says he\u2019s \u201cno bigot,\u201d because I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something in your word about trusting motherfuckers who say they\u2019re not racist, precious lamb.

(As an aside, I\u2019m very disappointed my \u2018Trumpling\u2019 insult/nickname hasn\u2019t stuck. Rhymes with \u2018dumpling\u2019. The boiled ball of dough served in gravy? Works on so many levels. Maybe it\u2019s not a thing in US cuisine.) This attitude that you expressed and I maintain is found all too frequently in domestic violence where the jilted ex pursues a murder-suicide solution by thinking \u201cIf I can\u2019t have her, no one can\u201d. In this case, the Trumplings as a collective, who because they feel threatened not being able to adapt to and cannot see themselves in a changed America, are saying: \u201cIf I can\u2019t have my America, then no one can\u201d... For what reason do Trumplings turn a blind eye to the innumerable contradictions, lies, and hypocrisy; to the unethical, unprincipled, and unlawful behaviour of Trump and the Republicans when the slightest whiff of such under Obama would have brought apoplectic screeches of outrage? Because, as you know, they do not want America to be for anyone other than themselves.\n\nFrom: Fakey McFake\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: none Hello, Mr. Harriot. I enjoy your writing on the Root. I had a stray thought that I share with you, only half jokingly. I do not feel there is an injurious-enough slur for white people. I am white. When I hear \u201chonky\u201d or \u201ccracker,\u201d I feel no insult. I do not care what a \u201chonky\u201d is, and \u201ccracker\u201d is just funny. However, if someone were to call me a \u201cTrump,\u201d I would lose my mind and turn red with anger. Perhaps one could start a campaign to install \u201cTrump\u201d as the worst possible slur one use for a white person, so that the name of this piece of human garbage will live infamy. Kind of like what the gay community did with Rick Santorum. This is probably a weird, terrible, divisive idea. In any case, keep up the great work. Don\u2019t ever call me a Trump.

Although the Vermont senator deserves credit for certain accomplishments\u2014pulling younger people into the political process and pushing the Democratic Party in a more progressive direction\u2014it\u2019s not as if the man had that great a shot at becoming the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee for president. Not when he was 3.7 million votes and hundreds of pledged delegates behind Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nFor all the fairy tales about the system being rigged and the \u201cMighty Morphin Power\u201d Democratic National Committee going against the will of the people, the reality is that more people wanted Clinton as their candidate.\n\n\n\nLast year, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Harry Enten and Nate Silver wrote this:\n\n\n\nAs Sanders fans claim that the Democratic primary system is rigged against their candidate and that Sanders wins when turnout is higher, they fail to point out that Sanders has benefited tremendously from low-turnout caucuses. Indeed, if all the caucuses were primaries, Clinton would be winning the Democratic nomination by an even wider margin than she is now.\n\nSomehow, though, Sanders\u2019 failures as a candidate have convinced far too many people that he can solve all the party\u2019s problems. Sanders may presently be the most popular active politician in America, but that doesn\u2019t mean he has the answers to fix the Democratic Party. And what\u2019s most hilarious about this is that he\u2019s not even a Democrat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSanders said so himself Tuesday night during an interview on MSNBC\u2019s All In With Chris Hayes. Sanders is currently on a unity tour with the new DNC chairman, Tom Perez, but when asked about party affiliation, he said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m an independent.\u201d\n\nTo quote Joseline Hernandez, \u201cHo, why is you here?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the Democratic Party is going to succeed\u2014and I want to see it succeed\u2014it\u2019s gonna have to open its door to independents,\u201d Sanders continued. \u201cThere are probably more independents in this country than Democrats or Republicans. It\u2019s got to open its doors to working people and to young people, create a grassroots party. That\u2019s what we need.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo his credit, Democrat and Republican Party identification is at an all-time low. Moreover, Democrats do suck at mobilizing on the local level. However, many may call themselves independent, but they do have a specific ideology and, in many cases, obvious prejudices. The problem with the latter is that Sanders refuses to acknowledge just how prominent those prejudices are.\n\n\n\nAt one of those unity events in Kentucky, Sanders said this about the state of health care in the state: \u201cI suspect that the Democratic Party here in Kentucky has not done the kind of job that it should have done. It\u2019s an investment. If people are getting health care, it\u2019s an investment.\u201d\n\n\n\nMore than 500,000 Kentuckians gained access to health insurance thanks to Obamacare, only Kentucky Democrats long avoided fully embracing it because of former President Barack Obama\u2019s unpopularity in the state. In 2012 Obama barely won 38 percent of the vote, down from 41 percent in 2008. In the 2012 Democratic primary, \u201cuncommitted\u201d netted 42 percent of the vote against an unchallenged Obama. Last fall, a GOP House candidate in the state posted racist images of Obama on Facebook\u2014and then he, a preacher, not only refused to apologize but denied that the images were racist.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the part where some\u2014hi, white readers\u2014will insert that not all white people are racist and note that there could be other variables behind Obama\u2019s popularity in states like Kentucky and West Virginia. Sure, but how many reports have we read since the last presidential election in which Tropicana Jong-il supporters are boastful about voting against their self-interests as they profess to continue to support the con they voted for? And why is that? Let me ask my black-ass friend, my trans sis or this dude I know who prays five times a day. If none of them answers, I can text this Puerto Rican bae I know.\n\n\n\nIf Sanders is to assess why Kentuckians would literally vote against their own well-being, he needs to not simply fault Democrats for not doing a good-enough job talking to the electorate. But no, as he\u2019s shown again and again, he will continue to deny the roles that racism, sexism and xenophobia played in the election.\n\n\n\nLast month Sanders said at a Boston rally with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.):\n\nSome people think that the people who voted for Trump are racists and sexists and homophobes and deplorable folks. I don\u2019t agree, because I\u2019ve been there. Let me tell you something else some of you might not agree with, it wasn\u2019t that Donald Trump won the election; it was that the Democratic Party lost the election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet me tell you, as far as American elections go, history tells you that white people are gonna white. Yeah, yeah; not all white people are Sarah Palin or Susan Sarandon. I\u2019m not Ben Carson. I got y\u2019all. Still.\n\n\n\nThen he tweets out nonsense like this:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFaux Yoda still thinks \u201cMake America great again\u201d was about the rent and the coal rather than the racism and the sexism and the xenophobia. Yes, there are millions of people getting involved, but many of them are the people facing deportation, increased police harassment and hefty amounts of overt discrimination. The party should be catering to them, considering that if more of those darker folks had voted, we would have a President Clinton and Bernie would be saying we should primary-challenge her in 2020 (as he suggested with Obama in 2012). Sanders says a lot about reaching out to 45 voters, but what about voter disenfranchisement?\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, at this same Kentucky event, Sanders was asked about Georgia congressional candidate Jon Ossoff and whether or not he was a progressive.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Sanders answered. \u201cIf you run as a Democrat, you\u2019re a Democrat.\u201d He added, \u201cSome Democrats are progressive, and some Democrats are not.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe statement isn\u2019t that bad, but you know, a quick Google search could\u2019ve done wonders. Moreover, considering that Democrats are really trying to get that seat (bless their hearts with this runoff), this still reads as pouring cold water on what\u2019s been a motivating story to folks in the party. But that\u2019s what happens when you let a person who isn\u2019t an actual Democrat speak about Democrats. The same can be said for placing so much faith in a person who can say that about Osoff yet endorse an anti-abortion Democratic candidate in Nebraska.\n\nSanders acts as if the Democratic Party invited him to shoot a docuseries called Bernie, Fix My Party, when, in actuality, Sanders is someone who showed up uninvited to an event and decided to stay long after the club turned the lights on. Sanders is doing well by himself with this newfound role as self-appointed savior, but ultimately, what good is this going to do for the party overall?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I wrote, \u201cShut Up, Bernie Sanders,\u201d a pool of liberal tears flooded my mentions as a bunch of \u201cBernie bros\u201d and their equally annoying homegirls seethed with anger. Criticizing Sanders doesn\u2019t make one a Hillary bot, but y\u2019all can keep up that Andrew Sullivan impersonation as long as you see fit. Nevertheless, Clinton can stay on her \u201cBitch, I Told You So\u201d tour, and the Clintons can go off into the sunset and enjoy their wealth, for all I care.\n\n\n\nFrankly, they both lost, and it\u2019s obvious why each did; but the one who performed even worse than the other election loser has managed the feat of appearing to be the one who knows all. Maybe gender is involved? Please advise.\n\nWhatever the case, if his advice includes continuing to pacify people actively engaged or complicit in multiple streams of prejudice, he can keep it. A lot of us are rightly fearing for our lives, and we\u2019re supposed to further coddle the assholes who helped create our nightmare? Even as they vote against their own well-being, to boot?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA major political party lies in peril, and one very shrewd politician has used it to further boost his own profile. Salute to you, sir, but spare me all the same. I\u2019d rather we not relive the 2016 presidential campaign. That buffoon on the right gets a lot of flak for not letting the past go, but the reality star isn\u2019t the only one who needs to let that show go already. That\u2019s actually what\u2019s most grating about this tour and media campaign: We in the club doing the same old two-step.

I was entertained by your writing and found myself laughing out loud a few times. I genuinely like your style of writing and will continue to read your pieces. But, as I read further into this piece I found myself getting more and more confused by your message. There was some obvious hate directed towards white people. I am a \u201cChad.\u201d I\u2019m about as Chad as they get. Like you, a Jamal, I had only one friend who was not like me. My one black friend, Tim, was the only black kid in our school. I can vividly recall the first time I knew he was different. It\u2019s when my Dad saw him and asked if there were other black kids at my school. That one question changed everything. It made me aware that Tim was supposedly different. Parents teach their kids when they don\u2019t even know it. As someone who considers themselves not racist, I teach my kids how to not be racist, prejudice, or an asshole by not acknowledging the difference in someone who is not white, heterosexual, or different in any way. If I were to point out their differences, it would be, at the very least, condescending. And I\u2019d be doing the same thing my Dad did to me, perpetuating prejudice. Its very frustrating to read about a generalization about white people and how they feel about black people. Why can\u2019t I read your column and just be entertained? Why do I have be lumped into a small group of people or made to feel ashamed or embarrassed to be white? I hate being hated for no reason. I realize that is exactly how you must feel. And that is how you very subtlely came accross. I\u2019m aware enough to know I\u2019m missing something. I\u2019m interested in hearing your take on this because I feel like you can honestly enlighten me as to why you feel the way you do about white people. And why you feel it\u2019s okay to generalize and lump us altogether. I challenge you to respond without bringing up what our shitty forefather\u2019s did, what previous generations did, or what you\u2019ve been told to believe. I want to hear what you have personally seen and experienced that makes you so comfortable in perpetuating prejudices. Thanks, Greg\n\nDearest Greg:\n\nFirst, I want to sincerely let you know that I am sorry that you are ashamed or embarrassed about your race. Unlike you, I honestly believe it\u2019s OK to be white.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a \u201cJamaal\u201d (you spelled it wrong, but that\u2019s OK), I also want to congratulate you for having one black friend way back in elementary school. On behalf of our entire Jamaal population, I offer our collective thanks for your charitable willingness to befriend someone who is black and to be so accepting of diversity that you remember the one black guy you rescued from the wild so many years ago. It moves me to tears every time I hear a heartwarming story like yours about how you were willing to adopt a Jamaal during your youth.\n\nAs for your challenge for me to respond without bringing up something your shitty forefathers did (again, you spelled it wrong; there was no need for that random apostrophe), I need some clarification on the matter.\n\nWould your dad be considered a \u201cforefather\u201d when he pointed out the race of your pet Tim? Because if parents teach their kids without even knowing it, as you claim, then it is obvious that yours taught you well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here is what I am trying to get at, Greg/Chad.\n\nYou cannot write me letters insinuating that I perpetuate racism against white people that permeates society and infects future generations while simultaneously asking why I am lumping you in with the fucked-up people who came before you. If one Jamaal like me can somehow make black people hate white people, then imagine the effect of an entire nation of Jamaals.\n\nImagine if, instead of writing on the internet, we Jamaals did this for the next four centuries: passing our hate down to our children. Imagine if we had Jamaal-only neighborhoods and caged the Chads into certain areas with underfunded schools and endemic poverty. Imagine if we threw job applications into the trash if they had the name Chad or Becky on them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only that, but what if every person named Jamaal benefited from the simple happenstance that they were named Jamaal? What if anyone named Jamaal could live anywhere they wanted, do whatever they wished and didn\u2019t have to worry about the random pitfalls of society because their name provided them immunity and privilege?\n\n\n\nAnd then one day, one of them overheard someone named Tim ...\n\nOr Chad ...\n\nOr Michael Harriot, telling people about the Jamaals.\n\nAnd after benefiting from being named Jamaal for a quadruple century, Jamaal sat down at his desk and typed a letter explaining how he lived in such privileged isolation from everyone else that he remembered the exact motherfucking day, time and year when he first encountered one of those poor, non-Jamaal savages, and took it in like a pet hamster, finally realizing that he lived in a Jamaal-based society.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow imagine, if you will, after all of that, this douchebag had stored up so much entitlement that he had the Jamaal-dacity to say to someone ... anyone:\n\n\u201cI heard what you said and I\u2019m offended. Now explain why you feel like that without mentioning anyone named Jamaal.\u201d\n\nJamaal, please.\n\nThis next letter is regarding the little girl who saw former first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s portrait and thought she was a queen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: j40oaks\n\nTo: Anne Branigin\n\nSubject: Oh ....

Did a black guy steal your college sweetheart? Were you cut from your middle school basketball team and replaced by a Negro with a superior vertical leap?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI want to applaud you for your candor, and for the fact that you embrace your racism. The majority of our hate mail includes the caveat \u201cI\u2019m not racist,\u201d but not yours, j40. I appreciate the fact that despite your obviously low IQ, your inability to dribble and being saddled with the gut-wrenching memory of watching Amber pose for prom pictures with DeMarcus, you know who you are: an unapologetic bigot.\n\nI recognize your hate for Michelle Obama. I know she didn\u2019t sign a single piece of legislation, have any role in governing or affect your life in any measurable way. I understand that it is her blackness that offends you (what else could it be?). The fact that a little girl could admire someone black must really eat away at your nerves.\n\nI have instructed Anne to stop destroying our country with this bullshit because\u2014even though the \u201cmillennial cupcakes\u201d appreciate positive stories\u2014I see now that you can\u2019t handle it.

It is sickening to read all of these fawners and you eat it up with a spoon. I speak truth to you Michael and I am no bigot. I have lived around all kinds of people all if my life and I can spot a phony when I see one, of which you are. You have deep seated hatred in your heart for white folks and you don\u2019t sound as though you really know any. You disparage President Trump without even knowing what he is trying to do, and yet you give a pass to the last one who was in office and did nothing good for the black Americans who live in the inner cities. Eight years and he only did terrible corrupt things. He was more concerned about men being able to go into girls bathrooms. Ask the black Americans who live in Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore and other inner cities and ask them what he did for them. Nothing at all. Bring in anyone from any country and support them, but turn your back on our citizens. That is what he did. Hucksters like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson he loves. Also terrorists are his friends, but not Americans. Our new president is trying to put Americans first, or can\u2019t you see that Michael?

(As an aside, I\u2019m very disappointed my \u2018Trumpling\u2019 insult/nickname hasn\u2019t stuck. Rhymes with \u2018dumpling\u2019. The boiled ball of dough served in gravy? Works on so many levels. Maybe it\u2019s not a thing in US cuisine.) This attitude that you expressed and I maintain is found all too frequently in domestic violence where the jilted ex pursues a murder-suicide solution by thinking \u201cIf I can\u2019t have her, no one can\u201d. In this case, the Trumplings as a collective, who because they feel threatened not being able to adapt to and cannot see themselves in a changed America, are saying: \u201cIf I can\u2019t have my America, then no one can\u201d...

I enjoy your writing on the Root. I had a stray thought that I share with you, only half jokingly. I do not feel there is an injurious-enough slur for white people. I am white. When I hear \u201chonky\u201d or \u201ccracker,\u201d I feel no insult. I do not care what a \u201chonky\u201d is, and \u201ccracker\u201d is just funny. However, if someone were to call me a \u201cTrump,\u201d I would lose my mind and turn red with anger.

You act like every white man hates every black man. Let me tell you something, you don\u2019t understand how not all white people are racist, just like not all germs are harmful or bad for you. So do you want to give me a better explanation about how Obama improved race relations than me just sitting through an article about uninformed statements about white people waving confederate flags and whispering racist jokes? Joe\n\nLike you, I also believe that former President Barack Obama ruined race relations in America. I have a theory that I like to call the \u201cObama effect.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBetween my sophomore and junior years in college, I had a job at a paper factory. I was the only black guy in the department where these huge paper tubes were made. I didn\u2019t know shit about paper or pulp, but I have always been pretty swift when it comes to figuring shit out.\n\nThe white guys, who had been working in the plant for years, saw me as an interloper and privileged dude who had never worked a hard job in his life. They even nicknamed me \u201cWorm\u201d because I was so skinny that my knees buckled the first time I had to lift one of those tubes.\n\nBut after a while, they also noticed that whenever there was a problem, I could help solve it pretty quickly. Soon they made me a \u201crover\u201d\u2014someone who basically wandered around the floor and helped fix shit. Whenever anything went wrong, they would call for \u201cthe Worm.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept for one guy.\n\nOne guy couldn\u2019t stand to ask for help from me. I suspect it was because he was so racist that he couldn\u2019t accept the fact that a black guy could figure out a problem that he couldn\u2019t. He would ask anyone for help except me, but they would always tell him to \u201cask Worm.\u201d This motherfucker was so resistant that he started losing his production bonus rather than ask me for help. He would rather be broke.\n\nThat\u2019s the Obama effect.\n\nI believe that much of the hate Obama received had nothing to do with politics. It was because these people had never had a black guy telling them what to do, and despite the fact that he fixed the economy, killed America\u2019s greatest enemy and gave millions of Americans health care, they would rather fuck up themselves and the country than admit that he was a decent president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s how Obama ruined race relations. For white people like you, Joe, racism was this country\u2019s secret shame, like a man with a small penis. But Obama\u2019s simple existence pulled down America\u2019s pants and exposed its flaccid inferiority complex to the world.\n\nBut Joe, it\u2019s not your fault that you were born that way.

Your hatrid for whites exudes from every pore. It is quite entertaining to watch, but I feel embarassed for you mostly. You are clearly a sociopath with narcisstic tendencies that thinks the entire world evolves around the struggles of the American black person. Are you struggling Mike? Really? You don\u2019t know struggle Mike. But you like to throw around those old tired words such as inequality, oppressed and racist. Yawn. There are people in today\u2019s world and historically that truly experienced those things, but not you Mike. You don\u2019t know struggle Mike. The reason you will never attain any respect or credibility is because you only think that you exist. Your selfish and self centered behavior refuses to allow you to notice the hundreds of other races in the world besides your own Mike. But you cannot see it and probably do not care. So, don\u2019t ask yourself why I don\u2019t care it either. You remind me of the person that Booker T. Washington was describing when he said: \u201cThere is another class of coloured people who make a business of keeping the troubles, the wrongs, and the hardships of the Negro race before the public. Having learned that they are able to make a living out of their troubles, they have grown into the settled habit of advertising their wrongs \u2014 partly because they want sympathy and partly because it pays. Some of these people do not want the Negro to lose his grievances, because they do not want to lose their jobs.\u201d This is you Mike. You make a living off of preaching hate and fueling the fire of division. Without it, you would be forced to find a new source of income, therefore, you choose to maximize the opportunity. Without this you offer nothing to the world. Is that what scares you Mike? All the skills you posses is being a race baiter? Come on man. You are better than that right? Get over yourself Mike. You will never win until you get out of the hole you have decided to live in. There are more races than just black and white Mike. You may want to pull your head out of your rear and notice how the hispanic race is blowing by you ever so quietly with wrecklace abandon, while you whine and complain. Best, Jorge\n\nWhen Jorge received no reply, he sent another message:\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nFrom: Jorge\n\nSubject: Hi Mike\n\n\n\nSILENCE...exactly.\n\nAnd this Twitter DM came from Brent:\n\nFrom: Brent Hello, I read one of your stories today and loved the way you over exaggerated it to make the readers feel your hatred. Yes some white people are definitely messed up and horribly racist but the only way the world will change for the better is to stop trying to create sides. I\u2019ve seen messed up stories made up by both sides. Don\u2019t be that guy. Your better then that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Jorge and Brent:\n\nI would like to fill you in on how I came to hate the whites:\n\nIt has been mentioned a few times in the comments sections that I was homeschooled until the age of 11. I was raised by a mother who was a combination of flower power hippie and Black Panther (not the T\u2019Challa one; the other kind). I lived in a black neighborhood. I had black friends. Although she taught me a lot about black people through osmosis and the huge collection of books in our home (I read The Autobiography of Malcolm X at age 7, and after reading the science fiction novel Soul of the Robot, I figured that Eldridge Cleaver\u2019s Soul on Ice couldn\u2019t be much different), she never really talked about white people at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I finally went to public school, I was supposed to be placed in the fifth grade but was skipped to the seventh. For the rest of my academic career, I was surrounded by white kids.\n\nAlthough white supremacy is inescapable in America, unlike most people, I had never spent any significant time around the whites. I was a black person who had never held any reverence, fear or respect for white people. Even after joining them in a scholastic setting, from high school through college, I never really met any white people who were especially smart or gifted. Being raised in a Caucasian-free bubble allowed me to view white people objectively, even more so than an immigrant would.\n\nBecause of this, I had many white friends, many of whom I am still close to. In fact, I\u2019d probably say I have more white friends than the average black person. Some of them are probably reading this right now. Almost all of them will tell you that I sometimes speak about race, politics and our differences without a filter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI say all of that to say this:\n\nWhen you read some of the things that I write, I know that my commentary often comes off as angry or belligerent, and I even understand why it seems that way:\n\nWhite people aren\u2019t used to anyone talking to them that way.\n\nMost people fashion conversations about anything in such a manner that they will be effective at changing the person\u2019s mind and get him or her to understand their viewpoint. As such, most conversations about race are tailored to appease white sensibilities. In a land built and sustained by white supremacy, the default setting is to discuss race in a way that caters to the sensibilities of the majority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFortunately\u2014or, in your case, unfortunately\u2014my upbringing was not entrenched in that way of thinking. I do not hate white people. I am simply unencumbered by the need to sidestep their sensibilities to make my point. White people are not my enemy. White people are not my friends. White people are not special to me. They are just people.\n\nSo when I write in this unapologetic, unfiltered way, it often offends the whites because they are not accustomed to being spoken to in such a manner. Because most of them are used to people\u2014especially minorities\u2014tiptoeing around their sensitivities to make a point, they interpret truth as anger.\n\nThat is white privilege.\n\nYes, I write about race. It\u2019s my job. Aside from that, I don\u2019t really think about white people that much. Sorry to burst your bubble, but I am not obsessed with race, any more than a carpenter is obsessed with wood. If you\u2019d like to believe that I walk around with a chip on my shoulder looking for ways to be offended by racism, I apologize.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJorge, I enjoyed your quote from Booker T. Washington. For most of his career, he was at odds with W.E.B. Du Bois on how they viewed America\u2019s race problem. Du Bois said of Washington, regarding the passage that you previously quoted:\n\nHis doctrine has tended to make the whites, North and South, shift the burden of the Negro problem to the Negro\u2019s shoulders and stand aside as critical and rather pessimistic spectators; when in fact the burden belongs to the nation, and the hands of none of us are clean if we bend not our energies to righting these great wrongs.\n\nIn all of your diatribe, you neglected to point out that racism does exist. If, by chance, it disappeared from the face of the earth, I would be happy to lose my job. I would even be delighted if racism withered away to a microscopic speck of bigotry undetectable to the human eye.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat hypothetical, tiny little bit of bigotry is also the size of the fuck I give about what you think of me.\n\nI get it from my mama.\n\nBe well.\n\nAnd finally, as promised, a bit of positive mail to end this week\u2019s mailbag:", "keywords": ["clapback", "blame", "roots", "obama", "racist", "dont", "mailbag", "mama", "mike", "know", "world", "race", "black", "white", "way"], "polarity": 0.04071927915148254, "subjectivity": 0.4846882464679076},

That\u2019s always been my goal.

After winning a close race for Democratic Party chairman, he chose his closest competitor, Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), an African-American Muslim and multiterm congressman, to become his deputy chair, a move that may be the smartest thing Democrats have done in the last two campaign cycles. It\u2019s a huge boost for African Americans in the party.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic Party is dependent on African-American voters to be successful\u2014locally, nationally and even functionally. So it made sense that the elections for the next Democratic National Committee chair, the first in the post-Obama era, would take place in Atlanta, a city that has recently snatched the \u201cChocolate City\u201d crown from Washington, D.C.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven the stakes at play, basically electing the leader of one of only two political parties that may run the United States, the DNC gathering was a rather low-key affair until the actual elections Saturday afternoon. The downtown Westin Hotel in Atlanta\u2019s convention district was sparsely populated, and for most of the day, the energy wasn\u2019t dissimilar to a Dunder Mifflin shareholder meeting.\n\nThe hallways were covered in campaign signs for the various DNC positions\u2014chair, vice chair and secretary\u2014and campaign teams lured you to their tables with candy, flashy buttons and Democratic swag. Walking from table to table grabbing Snickers, T-shirts and pens made it seem more like the most expensive high school student council election ever rather than the selection of the leader of a multimillion-dollar political operation.\n\nBy Saturday, election day, the temperature in the conference had jumped up considerably. Democratic luminaries showed up, including MSNBC host and former presidential candidate Al Sharpton, former Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and actress Lynn Whitfield. There were even rumors that former Vice President Joe Biden was in the building. Prominent African-American political activists and leaders were working the room on behalf of either Ellison or Perez, although the question remained whether it would make a difference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAll of these endorsements, they may work for some of the voting members, but not everyone,\u201d said Symone Sanders, former national press secretary for Bernie Sanders. \u201cThese are the people who are working, going to [Democratic] meetings every week, when some of these folks [endorsers] only show up at the big events.\u201d\n\nEveryone in the room believed the election would be close, with Perez having the backing of \u201cestablishment\u201d Democrats like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, and Ellison having the backing of the Bernie Sanders wing of the party. Although many in the Congressional Black Caucus backed Perez, there was a sense right before the vote that everyone had pretty good choices.\n\nJaime Harrison, chair of the Democratic Party in South Carolina, dropped out of the DNC-chair race and endorsed Perez over Ellison. When I asked him why, he had praise for both leaders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI love Keith like a brother. Over the last year I\u2019ve come to love Tom like a brother. But it comes down to who has a better Southern strategy. Who\u2019s got a red state strategy for the Democratic Party? Tom has it.\u201d\n\nAccording to California Rep. Maxine \u201cTrump Doesn\u2019t Want Any of This\u201d Waters, either Ellison or Perez has the ability to lead the Democratic party out of the political wilderness.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who wins, they\u2019re both gonna be great for the party,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd this is a great great time for organizing against Trump. He keeps giving us fuel every day!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat kind of attitude, especially from African-American leadership in the party, seemed pretty well founded.\n\nPerez\u2019s civil rights record on discrimination, housing and immigration as a Department of Justice attorney and labor secretary is impeccable. When a 2013 Breitbart article breathlessly begs GOP members of Congress to stop your confirmation, that\u2019s a good sign.\n\nEllison was re-elected multiple times in Minnesota and has strong ties to the African-American community, labor, millennials and the party\u2019s new vibrant left. Ellison lost to Perez in a close 235-200 vote in the second round, and soon after, Perez created the position of deputy Democratic Party chair and appointed Ellison to the spot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome Democrats, particularly African Americans on the left, are less than satisfied with this. It looks like the Democratic Party is sticking with the same old conventional leadership that relies heavily on black votes but refuses to elect substantive black party leadership. The DNC already has a vice chair position, so \u201cdeputy chair\u201d may be superfluous. However, the party has enough work to go around, and there is more than enough for Perez and Ellison.\n\nDemocrats need to fight voter suppression in the Midwest, continue gains in Arizona and Texas, and pay more attention to the South, where, because of gerrymandering, the Democratic Party has become the default \u201cBlack Party.\u201d\n\nPerez knew that he needed not only to cut a deal with the Sanders wing of the party but also put to African Americans into at least a vocal leadership role in the Democratic Party. Ellison, for his part, will make sure his \u201cdeputy chair\u201d position is more than ceremonial. It seems like the Democratic Party has finally realized that ot must unify ideas and wings of the party and not just rely on the hatred of Trump to bring voters together for Democratic policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf only they had figured this out last fall, we might have a different president in the White House.", "keywords": ["sanders", "chair", "party", "election", "political", "think", "victory", "africanamerican", "lead", "position", "voters", "bigger", "perez", "black", "ellison", "democratic", "leadership"], "polarity": 0.16264749299232062, "subjectivity": 0.43264575143885475},

It started with the election of President Barack Obama, who invented racism in a Kenyan laboratory with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Saul Alinsky and that terrorist dude from the Weather Underground. (I know his name is Bill Ayers. I\u2019m just using his white-people name.)\n\nEver since Obama released this terrible plague into our society, people much smarter than I have been trying to solve the racism riddle and banish it from the planet. They\u2019ve tried sensitivity training, revising history to make the Civil War about states\u2019 rights and\u2014most notably\u2014developing an antidote called \u201creverse racism.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the scientists here at The Root have finally figured out a cure. Our researchers ran our most racist emails, tweets, comments and direct messages through our proprietary software and analyzed the results. They detected a pattern that shows racism is inversely proportional to the ability to spell, capitalize and punctuate.\n\nYes, the cure for racism is grammar lessons.\n\nToday we share our peer-reviewed study. (Although, to be fair, Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan does not consider me her peer.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: Wait .. I thought you said \u2018pear.\u2019 No, I don\u2019t consider you my pear. \u2014Yesha]\n\n(Sidenote: Instead of including our positive emails at the end, this week they will be used as control subjects for our data comparisons.)\n\nHere are our results:\n\nIn our first test case, we examined the responses to our article on O.J. Simpson:\n\nFrom: Connor\n\nTo: Michael Harriot you are such a smug racist spewing piece of shit. Don\u2019t hate white people of this generation you fuck; we did\u2019nt do shit to you or your race. stop spewing hate. the fact you celebrated OJ\u2019s acquittal shows how dumb you are. karmas a bitch. really hope someone doesn\u2019t murder someone close to you. imagine that feeling you narcissistic fuck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is an example of our typical racist reader. Notice the lack of capitalization at the beginning of each sentence, something most people learn in their early elementary school years. While I am thankful for his hope that someone close to me isn\u2019t murdered, I question his use of a semicolon instead of a period. It could be a mistake, but when I combine that oversight with the fact that he misplaced an apostrophe in \u201cdidn\u2019t\u201d and just eliminated the one in \u201ckarma\u2019s,\u201d it shows how grammar has affected his mind state.\n\nNone of this indicates that the reader is dumb because\u2014wonder of wonders\u2014he didn\u2019t misspell \u201cnarcissistic.\u201d Plus, unlike some of our most racist readers, he didn\u2019t sprinkle ellipses throughout his message.\n\nNow let\u2019s take a look at a thread from a Twitter user who doesn\u2019t appear to be racist:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, Sarah, in her egalitarian white feminism, simply wanted to inject her narrative into an article that had nothing to do with her. She wanted to discuss sexism in an article that was specifically about police brutality and black lives. She wasn\u2019t necessarily being racist. She was exemplifying the white privilege that seeks to change every conversation and divert it to a subject she wants to talk about. As such, her only mistake (other than a comma instead of a semicolon after \u201cI understand you\u201d) was spelling \u201csay\u201d as \u201cday.\u201d\n\nSee ... not as racist, better grammar.\n\nAnd, finally, this:\n\nFrom: Edith\n\nTo: Michael Harriot I really enjoyed your article on OJ. I guess I\u2019m one of the few white Americans who really thought he was innocent. I recorded but haven\u2019t watched the Fox News interview but I will now very soon. I like to think that everyone judges people by their character and not the color of their skin but I know I\u2019m wrong. At 67 it is hard to understand why in this day and age color is still so harsh a feeling by some people. I grew up while the civil rights movement was in full force and saw the injustices that were going on in Selma. I guess I have spent my life wearing those 60\u2019s \u201cRose Colored Glasses\u201d but it was easier than reality.\n\nWe now have a man in the Oval Office (I refuse to call him President) who does nothing but preach hate belittles people. He is doing everything in his power to destroy all the good things that President Obama accomplished. I voted for President Obama twice and would have voted for him a third time if I could have had that privilege. I\u2019m praying constantly for impeachment but I\u2019m not sure it will happen.\n\nI work with black women that are some of the greatest women I\u2019ve ever had the privilege of knowing. We are all nurses and they are great. How anyone can judge a person by their color instead of their character is beyond my school of thought. Throughout my career as a nurse I have had the honor of taking care of many people of color that were amazing. I have heard of the difficulties of being black from the 1930\u2019s and onward. Some stories were absolutely fascinating while others just ripped your heart out. I can\u2019t imagine how black people felt with the way they were treated.\n\nI\u2019m also very proud that I have never treated anyone the way blacks have been treated. I think my parents had a great deal to do with that. I know you probably won\u2019t read all of this and I can\u2019t say I\u2019d blame you if you didn\u2019t but I wanted you to know there are some people out here who grew up in your parents or grandparents day that didn\u2019t grow up thinking they were better than people of color. My daddy use to tell my brother and me that \u201cthere was not one person in the world better than we were and there isn\u2019t one person in the world that we are better than anyone\u201d. I just know that if we remove our skin we all look the same.\n\nYou, Mr. Harriot, have managed to be the person that I elected to send my rants and raves at because of that dummy in the Oval Office, he is the one person that we are all better than. I get so angry at his actions I find myself hoping he will meet his Lee Harvey Oswald soon and I know that\u2019s not right.\n\nPlease know that believe it or not I don\u2019t write people like this but your writing was really great. I know you have probably turned blue at the length of some of my sentences but that\u2019s ok, you\u2019re right.

God Bless.\n\nSincerely yours\n\nEdith\n\n\n\nNow, I\u2019m not trying to grammar-shame anyone, but this is from a white woman. Notice that\u2014instead of saying that she doesn\u2019t see color\u2014she acknowledges the fact that she can actually tell the difference between black women and everyone else!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot racist. Better grammar.\n\nGood looking out, Edith.\n\nThis week, News Editor Breanna Edwards rankled a legion of white people when she wrote an article about the sentient colostomy bag who smeared her bodily fluids all over her roommate\u2019s belongings and got off Scott-free.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI honestly can\u2019t explain why they were upset ... they just were. They weren\u2019t just mad ... they were big mad. Take this comment, for example:\n\nFrom: LT1990\n\nTo: Breanna Edwards Dont even have to read the article to know that it is written by a racist bitch. Just because that nasty bitch got off with little more than a warning, it doesn\u2019t mean it had anything to do with her race. STOP RACE BAITING!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s kinda racist. You will notice that the only egregious error is the lack of an apostrophe in \u201cdon\u2019t.\u201d But it gets worse:\n\nFrom: FUCKTHEOBAMAS\n\nTo: Breanna Edwards Author is a RACIST. CUNT AND A SLAG.\n\nSee how\u2014as he or she upped the racism ante\u2014the number of capital letters increased? And what\u2019s with the random period?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, I\u2019d like to point out that, for black people, \u201ccunt\u201d is not really a thing. I understand that it\u2019s one of the worst white insults, ranking second only to \u201cwhite people.\u201d Also, what is a slag? I\u2019m sure I could look it up, but I don\u2019t know if I want to know.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t think I want that in my Google search history.\n\nHere\u2019s another one:\n\nFrom: SNOWFLAKE\n\nTo: Breanna Edwards Just goes to show you your BL DON\u2019T MATTER any more than anyone elses. Your still 2nd class. Better yet NO CLASS THATS WHY YOU LIVE IN GHETTOS ITS WERE YOU BELONG.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCase closed.\n\nAnd finally, this series of comments on the article about cultural appropriation and Bruno Mars:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: borgohugis\n\nTo: Michael Harriot One of the other hallmarks of appropriation is using someone\u2019s culture to demean, make fun of or diminish it. It\u2019s demeaning when money is made from Black music but doesn\u2019t go to Black people. It\u2019s demeaning when Black music is used to gain influence and power to a person that is not Black. It\u2019s making fun of Black people when a non-Black person pretends and is a mockery of Black music, dance and culture. It diminishes the Black legacy because Black artists aren\u2019t getting awards for the Black music they create. This deprives us of historical records and credit. Michael, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on but a pattern is emerging. A black woman broke this shit down and you said \u201cnope\u201d. When Mo\u2019Nique broke the shit down, you said \u201cnope\u201d. Why is your response \u201cnope\u201d when your argument is as weak as \u201cOr maybe they\u2019re just tired of seeing Bruno Mars\u201d. Wut?? You see fit to use your aunties as proof of Blackness but you are never here supporting the words of Black women. This shit is fucked up and you need to start thinking about what and who you are trying to support. If it isn\u2019t the words of Black women then I don\u2019t even know why you see fit to write anything especially something as weak as this. Bills must be paid and clicks must be had but damn do you really have to do it at the expense of Black women who are speaking truth?\n\nFrom: Kalx\n\nTo: borgohugis Thank you for saying this. I\u2019ve been noticing that I disagree with Michael\u2019s takes 87% of the time. It\u2019s mind numbing at this point. He\u2019s a lot like Charlemagne the Charlatan.\n\nFrom: borgohugis To: Kalx When he round about defended Charlemagne was egregious enough. Also the writing is so weak. He tries to wrap up the header in the last paragraph with the flimsiest reason after spending half the article giving evidence that goes against his argument.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest borgohugis and Kalx,\n\nI could tell you that I am the least sexist person I know and that I don\u2019t see gender. I could easily dismiss your criticism by saying that some of my best friends are black women (actually, just three; but three count as \u201csome,\u201d right?).\n\nInstead of rejecting your comments out of hand, I did what I wish some white readers would do. I examined myself and what you call \u201ca pattern\u201d that is emerging in my work. I didn\u2019t just examine myself; I examined my content. Here\u2019s what I found:\n\nIn 2018, I have written 148 stories for The Root. Twenty-five of those stories were about, or had something to do with, black women. Here is the list of black women I said \u201cnope\u201d to:\n\nSeren Sensai: Although I disagree with you on characterizing what I said as \u201cnope.\u201d I specifically said she \u201cmakes a convincing argument breaking down why Mars is a derivative artist,\u201d and that \u201cEvery single word Sensei said was correct, but none of it defined cultural appropriation.\u201d If you disagree on my interpretation, that is fine, but you should know that this article was sparked by my hearing the argument from men and women about cultural appropriation.\n\n\n\nAlthough I disagree with you on characterizing what I said as \u201cnope.\u201d I specifically said she \u201cmakes a convincing argument breaking down why Mars is a derivative artist,\u201d and that \u201cEvery single word Sensei said was correct, but none of it defined cultural appropriation.\u201d If you disagree on my interpretation, that is fine, but you should know that this article was sparked by my hearing the argument from men and women about cultural appropriation. Omarosa Manigault Newman: I admit that I wholeheartedly disagree with almost everything she does. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.\n\nI admit that I wholeheartedly disagree with almost everything she does. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.

Karima Garner: A black woman whose actions I vehemently disagreed with ... only because she killed another woman by injecting her booty with Home Depot silicone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the list.\n\nNotice that list does not include Mo\u2019Nique because when the \u201cboycott Netflix\u201d debate emerged, I was one of the first writers not only to defend her position but also to attempt to dissect it using the history and economics of Hollywood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven in the article you pointed out, I concluded:\n\nI wish I had Mo\u2019Nique\u2019s level of confidence and self-value. The idea that others cannot determine the value of your work is an important lesson. Maybe she should treat people better. Maybe she isn\u2019t as funny or as popular as she and her \u201cDaddy\u201d believes (I feel like I should put my name on the sex offender\u2019s registry every time I type that), but her willingness to say \u201cFuck your couch\u201d and stand on principle is admirable. Mo\u2019Nique is right. Black is often devalued because it is black. Women are often lowballed because they are women. It is difficult to live in that reality and reject it as a reason that she believes Netflix undervalued her. Even if she is wrong about Netflix, her larger point is also correct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t object to your characterization of my argument, even if you feel like I sided with \u201cCharlemagne the Charlatan\u201d or didn\u2019t castigate him enough. Maybe I didn\u2019t write it well enough or left it open to interpretation. Perhaps I was too evenhanded. I can accept that. I find it interesting that you think I dismissed Mo\u2019Nique while other readers thought I sided with Mo\u2019Nique too much.\n\nIn fact, one particular reader disliked my initial commentary so much that he called to explain his viewpoint as soon as the article appeared. I can\u2019t reveal our conversation, but let\u2019s just say he is a high-ranking executive for a company that rhymes with \u201cMetflix.\u201d\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t dismiss your criticism. If either of you feels that I am dismissive of black women or that I am wrong 87 percent of the time, I invite you to skip my byline. I can\u2019t imagine reading someone whose writing was \u201cso weak\u201d and was so wrong so often.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is my job to examine and critique race and culture. I try not to be too thin-skinned to accept the backlash or to ignore those who are critical of me. But Kalyx and borgohugis, I must admit that your comments made me rethink a lot of my prejudices for one reason:\n\nYour grammar was impeccable.", "keywords": ["clapback", "solved", "roots", "racism", "article", "racist", "think", "dont", "mailbag", "know", "didnt", "better", "women", "person", "black", "white"], "polarity": 0.03708051930708181, "subjectivity": 0.49681022102897116},

You act like every white man hates every black man. Let me tell you something, you don\u2019t understand how not all white people are racist, just like not all germs are harmful or bad for you. So do you want to give me a better explanation about how Obama improved race relations than me just sitting through an article about uninformed statements about white people waving confederate flags and whispering racist jokes? Joe\n\nLike you, I also believe that former President Barack Obama ruined race relations in America. I have a theory that I like to call the \u201cObama effect.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBetween my sophomore and junior years in college, I had a job at a paper factory. I was the only black guy in the department where these huge paper tubes were made. I didn\u2019t know shit about paper or pulp, but I have always been pretty swift when it comes to figuring shit out.\n\nThe white guys, who had been working in the plant for years, saw me as an interloper and privileged dude who had never worked a hard job in his life. They even nicknamed me \u201cWorm\u201d because I was so skinny that my knees buckled the first time I had to lift one of those tubes.\n\nBut after a while, they also noticed that whenever there was a problem, I could help solve it pretty quickly. Soon they made me a \u201crover\u201d\u2014someone who basically wandered around the floor and helped fix shit. Whenever anything went wrong, they would call for \u201cthe Worm.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept for one guy.\n\nOne guy couldn\u2019t stand to ask for help from me. I suspect it was because he was so racist that he couldn\u2019t accept the fact that a black guy could figure out a problem that he couldn\u2019t. He would ask anyone for help except me, but they would always tell him to \u201cask Worm.\u201d This motherfucker was so resistant that he started losing his production bonus rather than ask me for help. He would rather be broke.\n\nThat\u2019s the Obama effect.\n\nI believe that much of the hate Obama received had nothing to do with politics. It was because these people had never had a black guy telling them what to do, and despite the fact that he fixed the economy, killed America\u2019s greatest enemy and gave millions of Americans health care, they would rather fuck up themselves and the country than admit that he was a decent president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s how Obama ruined race relations. For white people like you, Joe, racism was this country\u2019s secret shame, like a man with a small penis.

Your hatrid for whites exudes from every pore. It is quite entertaining to watch, but I feel embarassed for you mostly. You are clearly a sociopath with narcisstic tendencies that thinks the entire world evolves around the struggles of the American black person. Are you struggling Mike? Really? You don\u2019t know struggle Mike. But you like to throw around those old tired words such as inequality, oppressed and racist. Yawn. There are people in today\u2019s world and historically that truly experienced those things, but not you Mike. You don\u2019t know struggle Mike. The reason you will never attain any respect or credibility is because you only think that you exist. Your selfish and self centered behavior refuses to allow you to notice the hundreds of other races in the world besides your own Mike. But you cannot see it and probably do not care. So, don\u2019t ask yourself why I don\u2019t care it either. You remind me of the person that Booker T. Washington was describing when he said: \u201cThere is another class of coloured people who make a business of keeping the troubles, the wrongs, and the hardships of the Negro race before the public. Having learned that they are able to make a living out of their troubles, they have grown into the settled habit of advertising their wrongs \u2014 partly because they want sympathy and partly because it pays. Some of these people do not want the Negro to lose his grievances, because they do not want to lose their jobs.\u201d This is you Mike. You make a living off of preaching hate and fueling the fire of division. Without it, you would be forced to find a new source of income, therefore, you choose to maximize the opportunity. Without this you offer nothing to the world. Is that what scares you Mike? All the skills you posses is being a race baiter? Come on man. You are better than that right? Get over yourself Mike. You will never win until you get out of the hole you have decided to live in. There are more races than just black and white Mike. You may want to pull your head out of your rear and notice how the hispanic race is blowing by you ever so quietly with wrecklace abandon, while you whine and complain. Best, Jorge\n\nWhen Jorge received no reply, he sent another message:\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nFrom: Jorge\n\nSubject: Hi Mike\n\n\n\nSILENCE...exactly.\n\nAnd this Twitter DM came from Brent:\n\nFrom: Brent Hello, I read one of your stories today and loved the way you over exaggerated it to make the readers feel your hatred. Yes some white people are definitely messed up and horribly racist but the only way the world will change for the better is to stop trying to create sides. I\u2019ve seen messed up stories made up by both sides. Don\u2019t be that guy. Your better then that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Jorge and Brent:\n\nI would like to fill you in on how I came to hate the whites:\n\nIt has been mentioned a few times in the comments sections that I was homeschooled until the age of 11. I was raised by a mother who was a combination of flower power hippie and Black Panther (not the T\u2019Challa one; the other kind). I lived in a black neighborhood. I had black friends. Although she taught me a lot about black people through osmosis and the huge collection of books in our home (I read The Autobiography of Malcolm X at age 7, and after reading the science fiction novel Soul of the Robot, I figured that Eldridge Cleaver\u2019s Soul on Ice couldn\u2019t be much different), she never really talked about white people at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I finally went to public school, I was supposed to be placed in the fifth grade but was skipped to the seventh. For the rest of my academic career, I was surrounded by white kids.\n\nAlthough white supremacy is inescapable in America, unlike most people, I had never spent any significant time around the whites. I was a black person who had never held any reverence, fear or respect for white people. Even after joining them in a scholastic setting, from high school through college, I never really met any white people who were especially smart or gifted. Being raised in a Caucasian-free bubble allowed me to view white people objectively, even more so than an immigrant would.\n\nBecause of this, I had many white friends, many of whom I am still close to. In fact, I\u2019d probably say I have more white friends than the average black person. Some of them are probably reading this right now. Almost all of them will tell you that I sometimes speak about race, politics and our differences without a filter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI say all of that to say this:\n\nWhen you read some of the things that I write, I know that my commentary often comes off as angry or belligerent, and I even understand why it seems that way:\n\nWhite people aren\u2019t used to anyone talking to them that way.\n\nMost people fashion conversations about anything in such a manner that they will be effective at changing the person\u2019s mind and get him or her to understand their viewpoint. As such, most conversations about race are tailored to appease white sensibilities. In a land built and sustained by white supremacy, the default setting is to discuss race in a way that caters to the sensibilities of the majority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFortunately\u2014or, in your case, unfortunately\u2014my upbringing was not entrenched in that way of thinking. I do not hate white people. I am simply unencumbered by the need to sidestep their sensibilities to make my point. White people are not my enemy. White people are not my friends. White people are not special to me. They are just people.\n\nSo when I write in this unapologetic, unfiltered way, it often offends the whites because they are not accustomed to being spoken to in such a manner. Because most of them are used to people\u2014especially minorities\u2014tiptoeing around their sensitivities to make a point, they interpret truth as anger.\n\nThat is white privilege.\n\nYes, I write about race. It\u2019s my job. Aside from that, I don\u2019t really think about white people that much. Sorry to burst your bubble, but I am not obsessed with race, any more than a carpenter is obsessed with wood. If you\u2019d like to believe that I walk around with a chip on my shoulder looking for ways to be offended by racism, I apologize.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJorge, I enjoyed your quote from Booker T. Washington. For most of his career, he was at odds with W.E.B. Du Bois on how they viewed America\u2019s race problem. Du Bois said of Washington, regarding the passage that you previously quoted:\n\nHis doctrine has tended to make the whites, North and South, shift the burden of the Negro problem to the Negro\u2019s shoulders and stand aside as critical and rather pessimistic spectators; when in fact the burden belongs to the nation, and the hands of none of us are clean if we bend not our energies to righting these great wrongs.\n\nIn all of your diatribe, you neglected to point out that racism does exist. If, by chance, it disappeared from the face of the earth, I would be happy to lose my job. I would even be delighted if racism withered away to a microscopic speck of bigotry undetectable to the human eye.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat hypothetical, tiny little bit of bigotry is also the size of the fuck I give about what you think of me.\n\nI get it from my mama.\n\nBe well.\n\nAnd finally, as promised, a bit of positive mail to end this week\u2019s mailbag:", "keywords": ["clapback", "blame", "roots", "obama", "racist", "dont", "mailbag", "mama", "mike", "know", "world", "race", "black", "white", "way"], "polarity": 0.04071927915148254, "subjectivity": 0.4846882464679076},

I\u2019m extremely disappointed that you feel the need to perpetuate the racial divide in this country. Admittedly, I\u2019m a white man. Not a white man of privilege, but a whit man nonetheless. I am a descendant of immigrants who came to this country with nothing and managed to build a lineage if success. It wasn\u2019t immediate and it wasn\u2019t easy. It took generations. I grew up on the east coast in some of the most diverse neighborhoods our nation had at the time. I shared classrooms and meals with people of color. As an adult, my home has always been open to people\u2019s of any origin, race, faith and sexual orientation. My son is gay. I admit that we all have our biases and some in this country have faced prejudices that I never will. That said, I have now read much of your work and can come to only one conclusion.. shame on you. Your work will do NOTHING to bring us together as a people. You clearly embrace the division because it gives you a platform. You are obviously an educated and articulate man. Unfortunately, you have chosen to use those abilities to perpetuate the division you claim to abhor. It is my hope that you see that your writings are not unifying or constructive. You have a platform to drive change.. instead you choose to perpetuate stereotypes.\n\nFrom: Michael G\n\nTo: Michael H.\n\nSubject Open Letter to White People Dear Michael, I find myself writing today in response to your article. I have to say that as a white man I cannot begin to understand the struggles that people of color are still going through. That being said, I wholeheartedly believe that within every individual is the ability to change their circumstances. If someone lives in the inner city and needs to get away, they can. If gangs are part of the equation, again, move. No one said this would be easy or cheap, but for the sake of children, what price? The people keeping the minorities down are the politicians and their rich friends who put just enough money into local schools so they don\u2019t close, and also they do things like dump $$ into Black Lives Matter. They want minorities to stay down. Stay angry. It\u2019s a cash cow for them. I truly wish we could all get along. Black Panther is just another cash cow for more elitist old white guys who conceptualized, bankrolled, cast, wrote, and on ad nauseum. I apologize for the rant, but I don\u2019t think that all whites are cut from the same cloth. But, being angry is usually the beginning of a fight. Thank you for your time. Michael\n\nBut of all the people who were angry, the people who believed the letter was addressed directly to them were the funniest:\n\nFrom: Tina To: Michael Don\u2019t lump. me in with white people. I have common sense. I don\u2019t lump all people of color based on lack of common Sense of the few.

VERY FAR FROM IT. FROM WHAT I read in that 1 article,that just popped up on my phone, I simply found YOU JUST HATING WHITE PEOPLE. The white people I & My husband know are SO FAR AWAY FROM BEING RACIST, IT\u2019S NOT EVEN LAUGHABLE. But for YOU to call ME a RACIST IS SO BEYOND FUNNY, IT\u2019S NOT EVEN FUNNY. Unfortunately, by YOU CALLING ME A RACIST, MAKES YOU ONE. If you really want to GO FOR it, DO YOU GET TO HANG OUT WITH THE ROLLING STONES? BET YOU DON\u2019T. AND YES,MY HUSBAND &I HAVE BEEN ON THEIR PRIVATE JET. I HAVE LITERAL PICTURES. Darryl Jones is one of the most kind gentlemen I\u2019ve ever met. I care 4u cause I feel so sad for you. I\u2019ll bet money that you do not believe in JESUS CHRIST? Right? Yes,and my husband and I are the HOLLOWAYS. AND YES WE DO BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST, CAUSE IT\u2019S THE ONLY WAY TO GET TO HIS FATHER, GOD. WHAT\u2019S GOING TO COME OUT YOUR RACIST MOUTH NOW? I can only wonder? THE HOLLOWAYS.....And YES I\u2019ll bet I have MORE money than you do. NOT that it matters, but I\u2019ll bet IT does to YOU? Right?Again.....The HOLLOWAYS\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter I didn\u2019t answer, she wrote back:\n\nFrom: Starlene\n\nTo: Michael harriot\n\nSubject: I just reported you for calling me A RACIST. NO ONE CALLS ME A RACIST! I Will bet you money that you do not believe in JESUS CHRIST. I can practically guarantee you know nothing about JESUS CHRIST/GOD.Do u know how to get into HEAVEN?I guarantee you do not. I will pray for you,cause I already feel & know YOU need help extremely badly. I already know that you will not send me back a comment. Right? Mrs.HOLLOWAY. AND how DARE you call the HOLLOWAYS -BITCH? We ARE a Famous family that you will NEVER hear of. We are quite people. PERIOD.\n\nOK, guys, as one of the world\u2019s foremost reverse racists, I would never diminish your pain. Although I would chop off my left pinky toe for the privilege of scanning the landscape of everything that offends me and black people and deciding that the biggest act of racism is an article about a movie about a fictional character in a fictional country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt must be nice.\n\nBut I\u2019ll be honest with you guys: I\u2019m not tired of you. Your words affect me in no way, and there is a very good reason why:\n\nEven though I think the fragility of Caucasians and their unwillingness to dismantle or accept their part in creating and upholding a worldwide system of evil, oppression and hate is hilarious, it is not overwhelming. The Root receives far more positive correspondences from people\u2014both black and white\u2014who appreciate the work we do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sorry to inform you that I will not be clapping back this week. Instead, I have outsourced this week\u2019s clapback to these three individuals:\n\nFrom: Susie\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Thank You Michael, I just want to send my thanks to you because I have learned so much by reading your articles. I am a white woman who does anti-racism work with adults and children (on a multi-racial team). I thought because I did this type of work for a living I was anti-racist and doing my part. Your writing has made me realize that I have so much further to go on my journey to be anti-racist. I have been reading your column for a year now and it has made me a better person. I think of your writing and you when I make that quick decision-Should I say something? Should I show up for that? Now, I always do. Sometimes I fumble through my words and get nervous and don\u2019t always make the point I meant to-but with your words ringing in my ears I never stay silent. As a way of saying thanks, I made a donation to the #BlackPantherChallenge in your honor. I wish I could do more. With gratitude Susie\n\nAnd this:\n\nFrom: Nicholans\n\nTo: Daniele Belton\n\nSubject: Prolly Just another Chad ... But trying not to beHello Ms. Belton,I am writing you today because I have been finding myself on TheRoot.com more and more every day. While at first, I must admit that I felt as though there was a tone of reverse racism in the many articles I have read, especially from Damon Young, and Michael Harriot, I pushed through knowing that further information will conclude that I am simply another Chad who grew up color blind and not knowing I was sitting there oblivious to the atmosphere the black community as a whole is still feeling in this country. Growing up in Southern California through the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, racial tensions are nothing new to me, however, my naivety did have me thinking they had improved. Especially with the election of President Obama, and his rise to prominence being achieved not only through the black community striving to have their voices heard and their votes acknowledged, but also because of those of many other races and backgrounds getting woke by the increasingly obvious racism that has come into further light in recent years due to social media and the internet. Growing up in a predominantly black neighborhood, and a very different cultural environment, when I moved to a new place that was predominantly white, I was finally faced with white privilege, and the obliviousness that I had been so na\u00efve to in my pre-adolescent life. I looked around, and felt very suspicious of every person(read: white) I interacted with. Going back to my old neighborhood from time to time allowed me to take some of my newly learned whiteness with me and help me realize how ignorant I really had been. Yet I continued to do nothing. Nothing to further the voices I was familiar with in a new environment who had so very few. Nothing to bring to light to these people, those who are suffering just a few towns away. I believe this is called White Guilt. Hard to say though, I am white after all, and don\u2019t know all of the terms I would suspect I should know. Fast- forward 20 years, and I find myself living in New England. Rhode Island to be more specific. I am now a software engineer at a non-tech electronics distribution company, allotted with an ample amount of time on the internet. This is where I have had the privilege to find the articles on TheRoot. Being that I have never been so aware of how many people in this country are still such racist pieces of shit, TheRoot has provided me at least some solace that not everyone is like these ignorant, ass-backward, self-proclaiming colonizers who still cling to the idea that the Matflower and its ilk are the only semblance of reality that matters. Frankly, I am pretty sure 90% of these people I meet, outside of the city, have never had a real discussion with any person of color.One article in particular that truly got me thinking, and made me want to further make changes in my life regarding activism, and how to behave as a still not fully woke white dude, was Mr. Harriot\u2019s article from 8-14-17 after the events in Charlottesville titled, \u201cFor Black People Who Have to Deal With White People This Week\u201d. Not only did this article provide me with insight on what NOT to talk about, it also showed me that, just because I am naively color blind, it doesn\u2019t mean it is my place and duty as such to speak of these things. It informed me to just shut my fucking mouth and let my interactions with people of color regarding such a \u201cyuge\u201d topic, talk to me if THEY feel like it and not because I feel in my whiteness that they should talk to me about it because of my empathetic wanting to appear, well, empathetic. This article pointed me in a direction to re-read most of the articles I had read on TheRoot with a newfound vigor to understand, and dismiss my aforementioned view of \u201creverse racist undertones\u201d. Also, it allowed me to understand why I feel the ways I do when I go to other news sites, and read the so-called news about current events that are reported by other non-woke writers who are reporting as only they know how to do at this moment. It showed me a way to prevent my \u201cwhite noseyness\u201d from being my purpose, and figure out WHY I was so enthralled and intrigued to get the information further from those directly affected, and less from those who act as if they are speaking for them. These things mentioned are what allowed me to see even further beyond the reported racial undertones of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d, and how it is not just another MCU comic book movie, and see the words I have always had in my heart and soul personified on screen with some of the most beautiful, well written, and brilliantly portrayed films I have seen in a very long time. I look forward to the day I can show this movie to my children to hopefully help them build a world that exists, as T\u2019Challa so eloquently described in the film, as a place where \u201cmore connects us than separates us\u201d. I feel this goes even one step further than Jordan Peele\u2019s \u201cGet Out\u201d, if only in its more universal presentation to a public that may or may not make the attempt to see \u201cGet Out\u201d. Which in itself is a tragedy as \u201cGet Out\u201d was amazing! All the way up to the end when every single person, who was paying attention, thought the cops pulling up at the end would inevitably result in the now completely demolished, Daniel Kaluuya, being arrested and not saved. Even writing this I get chills and shakes thinking about it and Black Panther. Both films had me in tears multiple times, and had me questioning what one Chad can do to make a difference without acting like another Susan who thinks they are beyond reproach only because they themselves are not \u201cracist\u201d. In conclusion Ms. Belton, I want to know what I can do to help. Beit joining my local black community in protest or purpose, or even using what I innately have as White Privilege to benefit the movement to end segregation and help others wake the fuck up! Thank you for this site, and hopefully for reading this as \u201cfrom a man who wants to further devote himself to change\u201d, and not just another Chad, Becky or Susan who doesn\u2019t realize I am speaking out of place. Sincerest Regards, Nick PS \u2013 to Mr. Young, I do not take offense, nor condemn anything I have read that you or anyone on TheRoot have written. I just want to make that clear since it may not be as apparent in my letter as it is to Mr. Harriot. Thank you.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most of all, this, from Twitter:", "keywords": ["clapback", "clapbacks", "roots", "michael", "article", "racist", "dont", "mailbag", "know", "writing", "black", "white", "secondhand", "im", "feel"], "polarity": 0.030450332311646174, "subjectivity": 0.47322082925185116},

I\u2019ll say it again: 63 percent of white women voted for the guy who was probably banned from a shopping mall for assaulting teenagers and for saying America was \u201cgreat\u201d during slavery. What world is this?\n\nWhite women as a modern voting block have hindered progress in this country, once again proving that they that would rather back a many times-accused pedophile and bonafide racist over literally anyone else.\ufeff\n\nApparently, an enduring one. White women\u2019s allegiance to racist, sexist, or predatory candidates is a long-standing tradition in this country and can be traced all the way back to their central role upholding white supremacy in the US\u2014stellar work they are still doing today. It was only last year that the majority of white people in this country proudly proclaimed, \u201cThe freedoms that we hold to be self-evident include a particularly skeezy kind of celebrity\u2019s ability to touch my vagina when he likes.\u201d In the 2016 election, as you\u2019ll undoubtedly remember, 63 percent of white men voted for Donald Trump, another alleged sexual abuser, as did 53 percent of white women, while 93 percent of black women and 67 percent of Latinx women supported Clinton.\n\nIn every presidential election since 1996, this pronounced gender gap has existed\u2014that is to say, most women voted for the Democratic candidate. But, in that time period, the majority of white women voters have essentially always picked the white Republican candidate\u2014no matter his utter betrayal of women, people of color, and other marginalized groups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe white supremacy is in the pudding: In 2012, 56 percent of white women voted for Republican Mitt Romney over President Barack Obama\u2014a number that shoots to 61 percent when you count just women 45 and older, and all of whom were ostensibly won over\u2014or at least not discouraged\u2014by their candidate\u2019s binders full of women. In 2008, 53 percent of white women voted for John McCain, a consistently anti-choice politician who once told a joke about a woman enjoying being raped by an ape\u2014even though in both 2012 and 2008, Obama carried the female vote. In 2004, 55 percent of white women voted for the \u201cstealth misogyny\u201d of George W. Bush. In 2000, 90 percent of black voters voted for Al Gore, as did 63 percent of Latinx voters, according to Colorlines. Still, 49 percent of white women voted for George W. Bush, one point more than for Gore.\n\nWhite women\u2019s voting penchants go all the way back to the elections of Ronald Reagan, which introduced the term \u201cgender gap\u201d into the national political consciousness. In the 1984 election, Reagan won 54 percent of the men\u2019s vote, but only 46 percent of the women\u2019s vote\u2014a gap attributed, again, to minority women: 93 percent of black women, 73 percent of Jewish women, and 65 percent of Latinx women voted for Walter Mondale and his vice president Geraldine Ferraro.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn many respects, white American women voters have proven to be interested in one thing: maintaining the status quo.\n\nBut you\u2019ve already heard this story: white women picked the white guy\u2014despite his complete disregard for the LGBTQ community battling the AIDS crisis, his opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment (though, of course, Phyllis Schafly, the ultimate rendering of this kind of \u201cfamily values\u201d-driven white woman, famously led a charge against it too), and his desire to eliminate a slew of entitlements that benefited non-white voters. That\u2019s not even to mention the allegations that came out in 1991 from actress Selene Walters that Reagan raped her in the early \u201950s.\n\nIn many respects, white American women voters have proven to be interested in one thing: maintaining the status quo, which comes at the expense of everyone who doesn\u2019t currently benefit from it. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about the \u2018women\u2019s vote,\u2019 it\u2019s very rare we\u2019re talking about issues on top of the agenda for women of color, poor women, and LGBT women,\u201d Juliet Williams, a UCLA political theorist and gender studies professor, told Broadly last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, truly, anyone but them. White women as a modern voting block have hindered progress in this country, once again proving that they would rather back a many times-accused pedophile and bonafide racist over literally anyone else.\n\n\n\nTheories about why this is abound. In a 2016 article in The Atlantic, Michelle Cottle attributes white women\u2019s unyielding devotion to voting Republican to sheer partisanship\u2014she writes that many women can\u2019t get it up for traditional \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d like adequate family leave and equal pay, that they\u2019d rather vote for a president who\u2019s tough on immigration or taxes. She also notes that hardcore Republicans and Democrats find it nearly impossible to switch to the other side. In a 2012 New Yorker piece, John Cassidy also tries his hand at this riddle, discussing wealth, age, and religion as potential factors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nthey have something\u2014status, an often false sense of security, a harkening back to Traditional Values\u2014to lose.\n\nAnd it\u2019s true, money seems to cut more cleanly than gender. The wealthier white women who vote Republican, and who voted for Roy Moore on Tuesday evening weren\u2019t voting to expand access to birth control or abortion, or for a commitment to civil rights and criminal justice reform\u2014they have nothing to gain with increased access to civic services. Rather, crucially, they have something\u2014status, an often false sense of security, a harkening back to Traditional Values\u2014to lose.\n\nMoore, and the GOP that endorsed him, recognized this fear of loss and, brandishing his petite gun onstage, offered a vague idea of protection: from immigrants, from the country\u2019s alleged declining moral center, from the loss of family, as well as a vague slate of values: Life. Security. Work. In short: keeping white people on top. And they voted for it in droves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCertainly these fears and \u201cwhite anxiety\u201d are not based in religiosity (remember: pedophilia). This means that, to many, the urgent desire to uphold white supremacy and all that goes with it must trump one\u2019s desire to create a society that\u2019s safe for all women. Perhaps, imagining something we\u2019ve never had is less immediately tangible\u2014less urgent\u2014than the loss of something sinister from which white women have benefited their entire life.", "keywords": ["vote", "fucking", "voting", "republican", "voters", "womens", "voted", "women", "white", "gender", "country"], "polarity": 0.06668133718133716, "subjectivity": 0.346119227994228},

I was entertained by your writing and found myself laughing out loud a few times. I genuinely like your style of writing and will continue to read your pieces. But, as I read further into this piece I found myself getting more and more confused by your message. There was some obvious hate directed towards white people. I am a \u201cChad.\u201d I\u2019m about as Chad as they get. Like you, a Jamal, I had only one friend who was not like me. My one black friend, Tim, was the only black kid in our school. I can vividly recall the first time I knew he was different. It\u2019s when my Dad saw him and asked if there were other black kids at my school. That one question changed everything. It made me aware that Tim was supposedly different. Parents teach their kids when they don\u2019t even know it. As someone who considers themselves not racist, I teach my kids how to not be racist, prejudice, or an asshole by not acknowledging the difference in someone who is not white, heterosexual, or different in any way. If I were to point out their differences, it would be, at the very least, condescending. And I\u2019d be doing the same thing my Dad did to me, perpetuating prejudice. Its very frustrating to read about a generalization about white people and how they feel about black people. Why can\u2019t I read your column and just be entertained? Why do I have be lumped into a small group of people or made to feel ashamed or embarrassed to be white? I hate being hated for no reason. I realize that is exactly how you must feel. And that is how you very subtlely came accross. I\u2019m aware enough to know I\u2019m missing something. I\u2019m interested in hearing your take on this because I feel like you can honestly enlighten me as to why you feel the way you do about white people. And why you feel it\u2019s okay to generalize and lump us altogether. I challenge you to respond without bringing up what our shitty forefather\u2019s did, what previous generations did, or what you\u2019ve been told to believe. I want to hear what you have personally seen and experienced that makes you so comfortable in perpetuating prejudices. Thanks, Greg\n\nDearest Greg:\n\nFirst, I want to sincerely let you know that I am sorry that you are ashamed or embarrassed about your race. Unlike you, I honestly believe it\u2019s OK to be white.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a \u201cJamaal\u201d (you spelled it wrong, but that\u2019s OK), I also want to congratulate you for having one black friend way back in elementary school. On behalf of our entire Jamaal population, I offer our collective thanks for your charitable willingness to befriend someone who is black and to be so accepting of diversity that you remember the one black guy you rescued from the wild so many years ago. It moves me to tears every time I hear a heartwarming story like yours about how you were willing to adopt a Jamaal during your youth.\n\nAs for your challenge for me to respond without bringing up something your shitty forefathers did (again, you spelled it wrong; there was no need for that random apostrophe), I need some clarification on the matter.\n\nWould your dad be considered a \u201cforefather\u201d when he pointed out the race of your pet Tim? Because if parents teach their kids without even knowing it, as you claim, then it is obvious that yours taught you well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here is what I am trying to get at, Greg/Chad.\n\nYou cannot write me letters insinuating that I perpetuate racism against white people that permeates society and infects future generations while simultaneously asking why I am lumping you in with the fucked-up people who came before you. If one Jamaal like me can somehow make black people hate white people, then imagine the effect of an entire nation of Jamaals.\n\nImagine if, instead of writing on the internet, we Jamaals did this for the next four centuries: passing our hate down to our children. Imagine if we had Jamaal-only neighborhoods and caged the Chads into certain areas with underfunded schools and endemic poverty. Imagine if we threw job applications into the trash if they had the name Chad or Becky on them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only that, but what if every person named Jamaal benefited from the simple happenstance that they were named Jamaal? What if anyone named Jamaal could live anywhere they wanted, do whatever they wished and didn\u2019t have to worry about the random pitfalls of society because their name provided them immunity and privilege?\n\n\n\nAnd then one day, one of them overheard someone named Tim ...\n\nOr Chad ...\n\nOr Michael Harriot, telling people about the Jamaals.\n\nAnd after benefiting from being named Jamaal for a quadruple century, Jamaal sat down at his desk and typed a letter explaining how he lived in such privileged isolation from everyone else that he remembered the exact motherfucking day, time and year when he first encountered one of those poor, non-Jamaal savages, and took it in like a pet hamster, finally realizing that he lived in a Jamaal-based society.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow imagine, if you will, after all of that, this douchebag had stored up so much entitlement that he had the Jamaal-dacity to say to someone ... anyone:\n\n\u201cI heard what you said and I\u2019m offended. Now explain why you feel like that without mentioning anyone named Jamaal.\u201d\n\nJamaal, please.\n\nThis next letter is regarding the little girl who saw former first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s portrait and thought she was a queen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: j40oaks\n\nTo: Anne Branigin\n\nSubject: Oh ....

Did a black guy steal your college sweetheart? Were you cut from your middle school basketball team and replaced by a Negro with a superior vertical leap?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI want to applaud you for your candor, and for the fact that you embrace your racism. The majority of our hate mail includes the caveat \u201cI\u2019m not racist,\u201d but not yours, j40. I appreciate the fact that despite your obviously low IQ, your inability to dribble and being saddled with the gut-wrenching memory of watching Amber pose for prom pictures with DeMarcus, you know who you are: an unapologetic bigot.\n\nI recognize your hate for Michelle Obama. I know she didn\u2019t sign a single piece of legislation, have any role in governing or affect your life in any measurable way. I understand that it is her blackness that offends you (what else could it be?). The fact that a little girl could admire someone black must really eat away at your nerves.\n\nI have instructed Anne to stop destroying our country with this bullshit because\u2014even though the \u201cmillennial cupcakes\u201d appreciate positive stories\u2014I see now that you can\u2019t handle it.

It is not to late to repent, but I think you will only mock me and what I have written to you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I thanked him for his letter, he wrote back:\n\nI got to you I see and I am glad. You need to repent Michael and all those Lily white liberals who are falling all over themselves to praise you also need to repent. You have a lot of people who are so in love with you or else they feel so guilty about their deep seated prejudices towards black people that they are so afraid of offending you else they fear they may be found our. It is sickening to read all of these fawners and you eat it up with a spoon. I speak truth to you Michael and I am no bigot. I have lived around all kinds of people all if my life and I can spot a phony when I see one, of which you are. You have deep seated hatred in your heart for white folks and you don\u2019t sound as though you really know any. You disparage President Trump without even knowing what he is trying to do, and yet you give a pass to the last one who was in office and did nothing good for the black Americans who live in the inner cities. Eight years and he only did terrible corrupt things. He was more concerned about men being able to go into girls bathrooms. Ask the black Americans who live in Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore and other inner cities and ask them what he did for them. Nothing at all. Bring in anyone from any country and support them, but turn your back on our citizens. That is what he did. Hucksters like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson he loves. Also terrorists are his friends, but not Americans. Our new president is trying to put Americans first, or can\u2019t you see that Michael? You need to seek the truth because the truth is the only thing that will set you free. Jesus said that.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlease allow me to pray with you.\n\n\n\nDear White Jesus:\n\nI come to you, Lord, not only on my behalf, but on behalf of all my people who don\u2019t know how President Trump is saving this country. We ask you right now for your forgiveness, Lord.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForgive us for offending David, precious Caucasian savior. I know you said \u201cthe truth will set you free,\u201d which is why we are probably in this predicament right now, untanned Father. But now I finally see the light of your brave prophets, like David, who are out here fighting the good fight, alabaster Jesus. I trust him when he says he\u2019s \u201cno bigot,\u201d because I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something in your word about trusting motherfuckers who say they\u2019re not racist, precious lamb. I know it probably doesn\u2019t say \u201cmotherfucker,\u201d my Lord, and I know there\u2019s something about false prophets, but Imma ride with the \u201cno bigot\u201d thing for the rest of this prayer, Jesus.\n\nYour Highness, I thank you for saving me from choking when he talked about how great Trump is and said Barack Obama did \u201cterrible and corrupt things.\u201d\n\nLord, I need you right now!\n\nI need you to erase the notion that almost every time someone says they\u2019re not racist, then brings up Chicago, Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton and transgender bathrooms, they always turn out to be racist, Lord. But not David, sweet Jesus. He is your servant! He has shown me the love of Jesus, precious Father!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn T\u2019Challa\u2019s name, I pray.\n\nAmen\n\nAnd for our positive mail, I will give you a few pieces of mail I have featuring one recurring theme that we often receive: suggestions for names to call white people:\n\nFrom: Milkshakedave\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Two things: Dear Mr. Harriot, In your March 2 Clapback Mailbag, I read the following: \u201c...they would rather fuck up themselves and the country than admit that he was a decent president.\u201d Your assertion has been the only one I\u2019ve read that has come remotely close to explaining what I\u2019ve felt for the last couple of years is at the centre of the Trumpling mindset. (As an aside, I\u2019m very disappointed my \u2018Trumpling\u2019 insult/nickname hasn\u2019t stuck. Rhymes with \u2018dumpling\u2019. The boiled ball of dough served in gravy? Works on so many levels. Maybe it\u2019s not a thing in US cuisine.) This attitude that you expressed and I maintain is found all too frequently in domestic violence where the jilted ex pursues a murder-suicide solution by thinking \u201cIf I can\u2019t have her, no one can\u201d. In this case, the Trumplings as a collective, who because they feel threatened not being able to adapt to and cannot see themselves in a changed America, are saying: \u201cIf I can\u2019t have my America, then no one can\u201d... For what reason do Trumplings turn a blind eye to the innumerable contradictions, lies, and hypocrisy; to the unethical, unprincipled, and unlawful behaviour of Trump and the Republicans when the slightest whiff of such under Obama would have brought apoplectic screeches of outrage? Because, as you know, they do not want America to be for anyone other than themselves.\n\nFrom: Fakey McFake\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: none Hello, Mr. Harriot. I enjoy your writing on the Root. I had a stray thought that I share with you, only half jokingly. I do not feel there is an injurious-enough slur for white people. I am white. When I hear \u201chonky\u201d or \u201ccracker,\u201d I feel no insult. I do not care what a \u201chonky\u201d is, and \u201ccracker\u201d is just funny. However, if someone were to call me a \u201cTrump,\u201d I would lose my mind and turn red with anger. Perhaps one could start a campaign to install \u201cTrump\u201d as the worst possible slur one use for a white person, so that the name of this piece of human garbage will live infamy. Kind of like what the gay community did with Rick Santorum. This is probably a weird, terrible, divisive idea. In any case, keep up the great work. Don\u2019t ever call me a Trump. Highest Regards, Fakey T (Not my real name.)\n\nFrom: Charles\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: suggestions How about the word \u201c Invaders\u201d?

It started with the election of President Barack Obama, who invented racism in a Kenyan laboratory with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Saul Alinsky and that terrorist dude from the Weather Underground. (I know his name is Bill Ayers. I\u2019m just using his white-people name.)\n\nEver since Obama released this terrible plague into our society, people much smarter than I have been trying to solve the racism riddle and banish it from the planet. They\u2019ve tried sensitivity training, revising history to make the Civil War about states\u2019 rights and\u2014most notably\u2014developing an antidote called \u201creverse racism.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the scientists here at The Root have finally figured out a cure. Our researchers ran our most racist emails, tweets, comments and direct messages through our proprietary software and analyzed the results. They detected a pattern that shows racism is inversely proportional to the ability to spell, capitalize and punctuate.\n\nYes, the cure for racism is grammar lessons.\n\nToday we share our peer-reviewed study. (Although, to be fair, Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan does not consider me her peer.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: Wait .. I thought you said \u2018pear.\u2019 No, I don\u2019t consider you my pear. \u2014Yesha]\n\n(Sidenote: Instead of including our positive emails at the end, this week they will be used as control subjects for our data comparisons.)\n\nHere are our results:\n\nIn our first test case, we examined the responses to our article on O.J. Simpson:\n\nFrom: Connor\n\nTo: Michael Harriot you are such a smug racist spewing piece of shit. Don\u2019t hate white people of this generation you fuck; we did\u2019nt do shit to you or your race. stop spewing hate. the fact you celebrated OJ\u2019s acquittal shows how dumb you are. karmas a bitch. really hope someone doesn\u2019t murder someone close to you. imagine that feeling you narcissistic fuck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is an example of our typical racist reader. Notice the lack of capitalization at the beginning of each sentence, something most people learn in their early elementary school years. While I am thankful for his hope that someone close to me isn\u2019t murdered, I question his use of a semicolon instead of a period. It could be a mistake, but when I combine that oversight with the fact that he misplaced an apostrophe in \u201cdidn\u2019t\u201d and just eliminated the one in \u201ckarma\u2019s,\u201d it shows how grammar has affected his mind state.\n\nNone of this indicates that the reader is dumb because\u2014wonder of wonders\u2014he didn\u2019t misspell \u201cnarcissistic.\u201d Plus, unlike some of our most racist readers, he didn\u2019t sprinkle ellipses throughout his message.\n\nNow let\u2019s take a look at a thread from a Twitter user who doesn\u2019t appear to be racist:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, Sarah, in her egalitarian white feminism, simply wanted to inject her narrative into an article that had nothing to do with her. She wanted to discuss sexism in an article that was specifically about police brutality and black lives. She wasn\u2019t necessarily being racist. She was exemplifying the white privilege that seeks to change every conversation and divert it to a subject she wants to talk about. As such, her only mistake (other than a comma instead of a semicolon after \u201cI understand you\u201d) was spelling \u201csay\u201d as \u201cday.\u201d\n\nSee ... not as racist, better grammar.\n\nAnd, finally, this:\n\nFrom: Edith\n\nTo: Michael Harriot I really enjoyed your article on OJ. I guess I\u2019m one of the few white Americans who really thought he was innocent. I recorded but haven\u2019t watched the Fox News interview but I will now very soon. I like to think that everyone judges people by their character and not the color of their skin but I know I\u2019m wrong. At 67 it is hard to understand why in this day and age color is still so harsh a feeling by some people. I grew up while the civil rights movement was in full force and saw the injustices that were going on in Selma. I guess I have spent my life wearing those 60\u2019s \u201cRose Colored Glasses\u201d but it was easier than reality.\n\nWe now have a man in the Oval Office (I refuse to call him President) who does nothing but preach hate belittles people. He is doing everything in his power to destroy all the good things that President Obama accomplished. I voted for President Obama twice and would have voted for him a third time if I could have had that privilege. I\u2019m praying constantly for impeachment but I\u2019m not sure it will happen.\n\nI work with black women that are some of the greatest women I\u2019ve ever had the privilege of knowing. We are all nurses and they are great. How anyone can judge a person by their color instead of their character is beyond my school of thought. Throughout my career as a nurse I have had the honor of taking care of many people of color that were amazing. I have heard of the difficulties of being black from the 1930\u2019s and onward. Some stories were absolutely fascinating while others just ripped your heart out. I can\u2019t imagine how black people felt with the way they were treated.\n\nI\u2019m also very proud that I have never treated anyone the way blacks have been treated. I think my parents had a great deal to do with that. I know you probably won\u2019t read all of this and I can\u2019t say I\u2019d blame you if you didn\u2019t but I wanted you to know there are some people out here who grew up in your parents or grandparents day that didn\u2019t grow up thinking they were better than people of color. My daddy use to tell my brother and me that \u201cthere was not one person in the world better than we were and there isn\u2019t one person in the world that we are better than anyone\u201d. I just know that if we remove our skin we all look the same.\n\nYou, Mr. Harriot, have managed to be the person that I elected to send my rants and raves at because of that dummy in the Oval Office, he is the one person that we are all better than. I get so angry at his actions I find myself hoping he will meet his Lee Harvey Oswald soon and I know that\u2019s not right.\n\nPlease know that believe it or not I don\u2019t write people like this but your writing was really great. I know you have probably turned blue at the length of some of my sentences but that\u2019s ok, you\u2019re right. Keep up the good work and please pray for a Democrat win EVERYWHERE.\n\nThanks for listening. God Bless.\n\nSincerely yours\n\nEdith\n\n\n\nNow, I\u2019m not trying to grammar-shame anyone, but this is from a white woman. Notice that\u2014instead of saying that she doesn\u2019t see color\u2014she acknowledges the fact that she can actually tell the difference between black women and everyone else!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot racist. Better grammar.\n\nGood looking out, Edith.\n\nThis week, News Editor Breanna Edwards rankled a legion of white people when she wrote an article about the sentient colostomy bag who smeared her bodily fluids all over her roommate\u2019s belongings and got off Scott-free.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI honestly can\u2019t explain why they were upset ... they just were. They weren\u2019t just mad ... they were big mad. Take this comment, for example:\n\nFrom: LT1990\n\nTo: Breanna Edwards Dont even have to read the article to know that it is written by a racist bitch. Just because that nasty bitch got off with little more than a warning, it doesn\u2019t mean it had anything to do with her race. STOP RACE BAITING!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s kinda racist. You will notice that the only egregious error is the lack of an apostrophe in \u201cdon\u2019t.\u201d But it gets worse:\n\nFrom: FUCKTHEOBAMAS\n\nTo: Breanna Edwards Author is a RACIST. CUNT AND A SLAG.\n\nSee how\u2014as he or she upped the racism ante\u2014the number of capital letters increased? And what\u2019s with the random period?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, I\u2019d like to point out that, for black people, \u201ccunt\u201d is not really a thing. I understand that it\u2019s one of the worst white insults, ranking second only to \u201cwhite people.\u201d Also, what is a slag? I\u2019m sure I could look it up, but I don\u2019t know if I want to know.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t think I want that in my Google search history.\n\nHere\u2019s another one:\n\nFrom: SNOWFLAKE\n\nTo: Breanna Edwards Just goes to show you your BL DON\u2019T MATTER any more than anyone elses. Your still 2nd class. Better yet NO CLASS THATS WHY YOU LIVE IN GHETTOS ITS WERE YOU BELONG.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCase closed.\n\nAnd finally, this series of comments on the article about cultural appropriation and Bruno Mars:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: borgohugis\n\nTo: Michael Harriot One of the other hallmarks of appropriation is using someone\u2019s culture to demean, make fun of or diminish it. It\u2019s demeaning when money is made from Black music but doesn\u2019t go to Black people. It\u2019s demeaning when Black music is used to gain influence and power to a person that is not Black. It\u2019s making fun of Black people when a non-Black person pretends and is a mockery of Black music, dance and culture. It diminishes the Black legacy because Black artists aren\u2019t getting awards for the Black music they create. This deprives us of historical records and credit. Michael, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on but a pattern is emerging. A black woman broke this shit down and you said \u201cnope\u201d. When Mo\u2019Nique broke the shit down, you said \u201cnope\u201d. Why is your response \u201cnope\u201d when your argument is as weak as \u201cOr maybe they\u2019re just tired of seeing Bruno Mars\u201d. Wut?? You see fit to use your aunties as proof of Blackness but you are never here supporting the words of Black women. This shit is fucked up and you need to start thinking about what and who you are trying to support. If it isn\u2019t the words of Black women then I don\u2019t even know why you see fit to write anything especially something as weak as this. Bills must be paid and clicks must be had but damn do you really have to do it at the expense of Black women who are speaking truth?\n\nFrom: Kalx\n\nTo: borgohugis Thank you for saying this. I\u2019ve been noticing that I disagree with Michael\u2019s takes 87% of the time. It\u2019s mind numbing at this point. He\u2019s a lot like Charlemagne the Charlatan.\n\nFrom: borgohugis To: Kalx When he round about defended Charlemagne was egregious enough. Also the writing is so weak. He tries to wrap up the header in the last paragraph with the flimsiest reason after spending half the article giving evidence that goes against his argument.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest borgohugis and Kalx,\n\nI could tell you that I am the least sexist person I know and that I don\u2019t see gender. I could easily dismiss your criticism by saying that some of my best friends are black women (actually, just three; but three count as \u201csome,\u201d right?).\n\nInstead of rejecting your comments out of hand, I did what I wish some white readers would do. I examined myself and what you call \u201ca pattern\u201d that is emerging in my work. I didn\u2019t just examine myself; I examined my content. Here\u2019s what I found:\n\nIn 2018, I have written 148 stories for The Root. Twenty-five of those stories were about, or had something to do with, black women. Here is the list of black women I said \u201cnope\u201d to:\n\nSeren Sensai: Although I disagree with you on characterizing what I said as \u201cnope.\u201d I specifically said she \u201cmakes a convincing argument breaking down why Mars is a derivative artist,\u201d and that \u201cEvery single word Sensei said was correct, but none of it defined cultural appropriation.\u201d If you disagree on my interpretation, that is fine, but you should know that this article was sparked by my hearing the argument from men and women about cultural appropriation.\n\n\n\nAlthough I disagree with you on characterizing what I said as \u201cnope.\u201d I specifically said she \u201cmakes a convincing argument breaking down why Mars is a derivative artist,\u201d and that \u201cEvery single word Sensei said was correct, but none of it defined cultural appropriation.\u201d If you disagree on my interpretation, that is fine, but you should know that this article was sparked by my hearing the argument from men and women about cultural appropriation. Omarosa Manigault Newman: I admit that I wholeheartedly disagree with almost everything she does. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.\n\nI admit that I wholeheartedly disagree with almost everything she does. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.

Karima Garner: A black woman whose actions I vehemently disagreed with ... only because she killed another woman by injecting her booty with Home Depot silicone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the list.\n\nNotice that list does not include Mo\u2019Nique because when the \u201cboycott Netflix\u201d debate emerged, I was one of the first writers not only to defend her position but also to attempt to dissect it using the history and economics of Hollywood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven in the article you pointed out, I concluded:\n\nI wish I had Mo\u2019Nique\u2019s level of confidence and self-value. The idea that others cannot determine the value of your work is an important lesson. Maybe she should treat people better. Maybe she isn\u2019t as funny or as popular as she and her \u201cDaddy\u201d believes (I feel like I should put my name on the sex offender\u2019s registry every time I type that), but her willingness to say \u201cFuck your couch\u201d and stand on principle is admirable. Mo\u2019Nique is right. Black is often devalued because it is black. Women are often lowballed because they are women. It is difficult to live in that reality and reject it as a reason that she believes Netflix undervalued her. Even if she is wrong about Netflix, her larger point is also correct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t object to your characterization of my argument, even if you feel like I sided with \u201cCharlemagne the Charlatan\u201d or didn\u2019t castigate him enough. Maybe I didn\u2019t write it well enough or left it open to interpretation. Perhaps I was too evenhanded. I can accept that. I find it interesting that you think I dismissed Mo\u2019Nique while other readers thought I sided with Mo\u2019Nique too much.\n\nIn fact, one particular reader disliked my initial commentary so much that he called to explain his viewpoint as soon as the article appeared. I can\u2019t reveal our conversation, but let\u2019s just say he is a high-ranking executive for a company that rhymes with \u201cMetflix.\u201d\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t dismiss your criticism. If either of you feels that I am dismissive of black women or that I am wrong 87 percent of the time, I invite you to skip my byline. I can\u2019t imagine reading someone whose writing was \u201cso weak\u201d and was so wrong so often.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is my job to examine and critique race and culture. I try not to be too thin-skinned to accept the backlash or to ignore those who are critical of me. But Kalyx and borgohugis, I must admit that your comments made me rethink a lot of my prejudices for one reason:\n\nYour grammar was impeccable.", "keywords": ["clapback", "solved", "roots", "racism", "article", "racist", "think", "dont", "mailbag", "know", "didnt", "better", "women", "person", "black", "white"], "polarity": 0.03708051930708181, "subjectivity": 0.49681022102897116},

I\u2019m extremely disappointed that you feel the need to perpetuate the racial divide in this country. Admittedly, I\u2019m a white man. Not a white man of privilege, but a whit man nonetheless. I am a descendant of immigrants who came to this country with nothing and managed to build a lineage if success. It wasn\u2019t immediate and it wasn\u2019t easy. It took generations. I grew up on the east coast in some of the most diverse neighborhoods our nation had at the time. I shared classrooms and meals with people of color. As an adult, my home has always been open to people\u2019s of any origin, race, faith and sexual orientation. My son is gay. I admit that we all have our biases and some in this country have faced prejudices that I never will. That said, I have now read much of your work and can come to only one conclusion.. shame on you. Your work will do NOTHING to bring us together as a people. You clearly embrace the division because it gives you a platform. You are obviously an educated and articulate man. Unfortunately, you have chosen to use those abilities to perpetuate the division you claim to abhor. It is my hope that you see that your writings are not unifying or constructive. You have a platform to drive change.. instead you choose to perpetuate stereotypes.\n\nFrom: Michael G\n\nTo: Michael H.\n\nSubject Open Letter to White People Dear Michael, I find myself writing today in response to your article. I have to say that as a white man I cannot begin to understand the struggles that people of color are still going through. That being said, I wholeheartedly believe that within every individual is the ability to change their circumstances. If someone lives in the inner city and needs to get away, they can. If gangs are part of the equation, again, move. No one said this would be easy or cheap, but for the sake of children, what price? The people keeping the minorities down are the politicians and their rich friends who put just enough money into local schools so they don\u2019t close, and also they do things like dump $$ into Black Lives Matter. They want minorities to stay down. Stay angry. It\u2019s a cash cow for them. I truly wish we could all get along. Black Panther is just another cash cow for more elitist old white guys who conceptualized, bankrolled, cast, wrote, and on ad nauseum. I apologize for the rant, but I don\u2019t think that all whites are cut from the same cloth. But, being angry is usually the beginning of a fight. Thank you for your time. Michael\n\nBut of all the people who were angry, the people who believed the letter was addressed directly to them were the funniest:\n\nFrom: Tina To: Michael Don\u2019t lump. me in with white people. I have common sense. I don\u2019t lump all people of color based on lack of common Sense of the few. Famous or vocal does not equal common sense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the coup de grace:\n\nFrom: Starlene\n\nTo: Michael\n\nSubject: I\u2019m NOT THE RACIST. SEEMS YOU ARE Slept w& fell in love w/an African American and had a child. Did I give up on that child cause at that particular time, 30,some ought years ago that was not so very much liked? I lived &STILL live in that same neighborhood. Yes, it\u2019s a weathly neighborhood, buy I could care less about that. Thankfully, most of those people who said that to ME about MY child, have now passed on. R.I.P TO THEM CAUSE THEY\u2019LL NEED IT WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER JESUS CHRIST. U HAVE TO GO THROUGH JESUS CHRIST TO GET TO HIS FATHER, GOD. BET YOU DIDN\u2019T KNOW THAT, DID YOU? I know for a fact that I and my now HANDSOME WEALTHY WHITE HUSBAND are NOT RACIST. VERY FAR FROM IT. FROM WHAT I read in that 1 article,that just popped up on my phone, I simply found YOU JUST HATING WHITE PEOPLE. The white people I & My husband know are SO FAR AWAY FROM BEING RACIST, IT\u2019S NOT EVEN LAUGHABLE. But for YOU to call ME a RACIST IS SO BEYOND FUNNY, IT\u2019S NOT EVEN FUNNY. Unfortunately, by YOU CALLING ME A RACIST, MAKES YOU ONE. If you really want to GO FOR it, DO YOU GET TO HANG OUT WITH THE ROLLING STONES? BET YOU DON\u2019T. AND YES,MY HUSBAND &I HAVE BEEN ON THEIR PRIVATE JET. I HAVE LITERAL PICTURES. Darryl Jones is one of the most kind gentlemen I\u2019ve ever met. I care 4u cause I feel so sad for you. I\u2019ll bet money that you do not believe in JESUS CHRIST? Right? Yes,and my husband and I are the HOLLOWAYS. AND YES WE DO BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST, CAUSE IT\u2019S THE ONLY WAY TO GET TO HIS FATHER, GOD. WHAT\u2019S GOING TO COME OUT YOUR RACIST MOUTH NOW? I can only wonder? THE HOLLOWAYS.....And YES I\u2019ll bet I have MORE money than you do. NOT that it matters, but I\u2019ll bet IT does to YOU? Right?Again.....The HOLLOWAYS\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter I didn\u2019t answer, she wrote back:\n\nFrom: Starlene\n\nTo: Michael harriot\n\nSubject: I just reported you for calling me A RACIST. NO ONE CALLS ME A RACIST! I Will bet you money that you do not believe in JESUS CHRIST. I can practically guarantee you know nothing about JESUS CHRIST/GOD.Do u know how to get into HEAVEN?I guarantee you do not. I will pray for you,cause I already feel & know YOU need help extremely badly. I already know that you will not send me back a comment. Right? Mrs.HOLLOWAY. AND how DARE you call the HOLLOWAYS -BITCH? We ARE a Famous family that you will NEVER hear of. We are quite people. PERIOD.\n\nOK, guys, as one of the world\u2019s foremost reverse racists, I would never diminish your pain. Although I would chop off my left pinky toe for the privilege of scanning the landscape of everything that offends me and black people and deciding that the biggest act of racism is an article about a movie about a fictional character in a fictional country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt must be nice.\n\nBut I\u2019ll be honest with you guys: I\u2019m not tired of you. Your words affect me in no way, and there is a very good reason why:\n\nEven though I think the fragility of Caucasians and their unwillingness to dismantle or accept their part in creating and upholding a worldwide system of evil, oppression and hate is hilarious, it is not overwhelming. The Root receives far more positive correspondences from people\u2014both black and white\u2014who appreciate the work we do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sorry to inform you that I will not be clapping back this week. Instead, I have outsourced this week\u2019s clapback to these three individuals:\n\nFrom: Susie\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Thank You Michael, I just want to send my thanks to you because I have learned so much by reading your articles. I am a white woman who does anti-racism work with adults and children (on a multi-racial team). I thought because I did this type of work for a living I was anti-racist and doing my part. Your writing has made me realize that I have so much further to go on my journey to be anti-racist. I have been reading your column for a year now and it has made me a better person. I think of your writing and you when I make that quick decision-Should I say something? Should I show up for that? Now, I always do. Sometimes I fumble through my words and get nervous and don\u2019t always make the point I meant to-but with your words ringing in my ears I never stay silent. As a way of saying thanks, I made a donation to the #BlackPantherChallenge in your honor. I wish I could do more. With gratitude Susie\n\nAnd this:\n\nFrom: Nicholans\n\nTo: Daniele Belton\n\nSubject: Prolly Just another Chad ... But trying not to beHello Ms. Belton,I am writing you today because I have been finding myself on TheRoot.com more and more every day. While at first, I must admit that I felt as though there was a tone of reverse racism in the many articles I have read, especially from Damon Young, and Michael Harriot, I pushed through knowing that further information will conclude that I am simply another Chad who grew up color blind and not knowing I was sitting there oblivious to the atmosphere the black community as a whole is still feeling in this country. Growing up in Southern California through the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, racial tensions are nothing new to me, however, my naivety did have me thinking they had improved. Especially with the election of President Obama, and his rise to prominence being achieved not only through the black community striving to have their voices heard and their votes acknowledged, but also because of those of many other races and backgrounds getting woke by the increasingly obvious racism that has come into further light in recent years due to social media and the internet. Growing up in a predominantly black neighborhood, and a very different cultural environment, when I moved to a new place that was predominantly white, I was finally faced with white privilege, and the obliviousness that I had been so na\u00efve to in my pre-adolescent life. I looked around, and felt very suspicious of every person(read: white) I interacted with. Going back to my old neighborhood from time to time allowed me to take some of my newly learned whiteness with me and help me realize how ignorant I really had been. Yet I continued to do nothing. Nothing to further the voices I was familiar with in a new environment who had so very few. Nothing to bring to light to these people, those who are suffering just a few towns away. I believe this is called White Guilt. Hard to say though, I am white after all, and don\u2019t know all of the terms I would suspect I should know. Fast- forward 20 years, and I find myself living in New England. Rhode Island to be more specific. I am now a software engineer at a non-tech electronics distribution company, allotted with an ample amount of time on the internet. This is where I have had the privilege to find the articles on TheRoot. Being that I have never been so aware of how many people in this country are still such racist pieces of shit, TheRoot has provided me at least some solace that not everyone is like these ignorant, ass-backward, self-proclaiming colonizers who still cling to the idea that the Matflower and its ilk are the only semblance of reality that matters. Frankly, I am pretty sure 90% of these people I meet, outside of the city, have never had a real discussion with any person of color.One article in particular that truly got me thinking, and made me want to further make changes in my life regarding activism, and how to behave as a still not fully woke white dude, was Mr. Harriot\u2019s article from 8-14-17 after the events in Charlottesville titled, \u201cFor Black People Who Have to Deal With White People This Week\u201d. Not only did this article provide me with insight on what NOT to talk about, it also showed me that, just because I am naively color blind, it doesn\u2019t mean it is my place and duty as such to speak of these things. It informed me to just shut my fucking mouth and let my interactions with people of color regarding such a \u201cyuge\u201d topic, talk to me if THEY feel like it and not because I feel in my whiteness that they should talk to me about it because of my empathetic wanting to appear, well, empathetic. This article pointed me in a direction to re-read most of the articles I had read on TheRoot with a newfound vigor to understand, and dismiss my aforementioned view of \u201creverse racist undertones\u201d. Also, it allowed me to understand why I feel the ways I do when I go to other news sites, and read the so-called news about current events that are reported by other non-woke writers who are reporting as only they know how to do at this moment. It showed me a way to prevent my \u201cwhite noseyness\u201d from being my purpose, and figure out WHY I was so enthralled and intrigued to get the information further from those directly affected, and less from those who act as if they are speaking for them. These things mentioned are what allowed me to see even further beyond the reported racial undertones of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d, and how it is not just another MCU comic book movie, and see the words I have always had in my heart and soul personified on screen with some of the most beautiful, well written, and brilliantly portrayed films I have seen in a very long time. I look forward to the day I can show this movie to my children to hopefully help them build a world that exists, as T\u2019Challa so eloquently described in the film, as a place where \u201cmore connects us than separates us\u201d. I feel this goes even one step further than Jordan Peele\u2019s \u201cGet Out\u201d, if only in its more universal presentation to a public that may or may not make the attempt to see \u201cGet Out\u201d. Which in itself is a tragedy as \u201cGet Out\u201d was amazing! All the way up to the end when every single person, who was paying attention, thought the cops pulling up at the end would inevitably result in the now completely demolished, Daniel Kaluuya, being arrested and not saved. Even writing this I get chills and shakes thinking about it and Black Panther. Both films had me in tears multiple times, and had me questioning what one Chad can do to make a difference without acting like another Susan who thinks they are beyond reproach only because they themselves are not \u201cracist\u201d. In conclusion Ms. Belton, I want to know what I can do to help. Beit joining my local black community in protest or purpose, or even using what I innately have as White Privilege to benefit the movement to end segregation and help others wake the fuck up! Thank you for this site, and hopefully for reading this as \u201cfrom a man who wants to further devote himself to change\u201d, and not just another Chad, Becky or Susan who doesn\u2019t realize I am speaking out of place. Sincerest Regards, Nick PS \u2013 to Mr. Young, I do not take offense, nor condemn anything I have read that you or anyone on TheRoot have written. I just want to make that clear since it may not be as apparent in my letter as it is to Mr. Harriot. Thank you.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most of all, this, from Twitter:", "keywords": ["clapback", "clapbacks", "roots", "michael", "article", "racist", "dont", "mailbag", "know", "writing", "black", "white", "secondhand", "im", "feel"], "polarity": 0.030450332311646174, "subjectivity": 0.47322082925185116},

This week\u2019s roundup of emails, comments, tweets and direct messages comes from white people who aren\u2019t racist; they just want the writers at The Root to stick to facts.\n\nFor insight, we collected a few of the people who set aside their disdain for our obvious lack of intelligence so that they could educate us on the truth. We wanted to highlight these unseen contributors as a way of thanking them for their continued support. Without you, where would we be?\n\nLet\u2019s read some mail.\n\nOur first set of correspondence doesn\u2019t relate to any particular post. In fact, we could do a Clapback Mailbag every day if we wanted to post the messages we receive from white people who want to share data about how fucked up black people are. These are only two examples. Warning: The first one is extremely long, but we included it because it is most representative of many of the emails we get regarding this subject.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA direct message from Twitter user @RicciBicci:\n\nAfrican Americans accounted for 52.5% of all homicide offenders from 1980 to 2008. Black people make up 12.5% of the population. Let that sink in... But go on dodge, duck and use the whatever excuse you want. An no I\u2019m not a racist etc so don\u2019t even use that card. Just think you are terrible for black people.\n\nAnd this:\n\nFrom: Tyler\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Black on Black Crime Michael, Please see my proven statistical response to your roots article on black on black crime. Also, you can see in my pic I am what you would call a black man 1. Data shows that 93 percent of black homicide victims are killed by other blacks. The left\u2019s rebuttal is that that 84 percent of white homicide victims are killed by other whites, but The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Jason Riley points outthat the white crime rate is \u201cmuch lower than the black rate.\u201d 2. FBI Statistics: \u201cBlacks commit violent crimes at 7 to 10 times the rate that whites do.\u201d Blacks committed 52 percent of homicides between 1980 and 2008, despite composing just 13 percent of the population. Across the same timeframe, whites committed 45 percent of homicides while composing 77% of the population, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Here are some more statistics from the FBI: In 2013, the FBI has black criminals carrying out 38 per cent of murders, compared to 31.1 per cent for whites. The offender\u2019s race was \u201cunknown\u201d in 29.1 per cent of cases. What about violent crime more generally? FBI arrest rates are one way into this. Over the last three years of data \u2013 2011 to 2013 \u2013 38.5 per cent of people arrested for murder, manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault were black. 3. Black crime is even more prevalent in the country\u2019s largest cities and counties. Heather Mac Donald writes in her book The War on Cops: How the New Attack on Law and Order Makes Everyone Less Safe that in Chicago, IL, blacks committed 76 percent of all homicides, despite composing 35 percent of the city\u2019s population. Blacks also accounted for 78 percent of all juvenile arrests. Whites, who compose 28 percent of the city\u2019s population, committed 4 percent of its homicides and 3.5 percent of its juvenile arrests. Hispanics, who compose 30 percent of the city\u2019s population, committed 19 percent of its homicides and 18 percent of its juvenile arrests. (Another eye-opening fact from Mac Donald\u2019s research is that only 26 percent of murder cases were solved in Chicago.) Blacks are 10 percent of the population in Los Angeles, CA, but commit 42 percent of its robberies and 34 percent of its felonies. Whites make up 29 percent of the city\u2019s population, and commit 5 percent of its robberies and 13 percent of its felonies. In New York City, blacks committed \u201c75 percent of all shootings, 70 percent of all robberies, and 66 percent of all violent crime,\u201d despite only composing 23 percent of the population, said Mac Donald in a Hillsdale speech. Additionally, 2009 Bureau of Justice Statistics numbers show that in 2009, \u201cblacks were charged with 62 percent of robberies, 57 percent of murders and 45 percent of assaults in the 75 biggest counties in the country, despite only comprising roughly 15 percent of the population in these counties.\u201d 4. There were almost 6,000 blacks killed by other blacks in 2015. By contrast, only 258 blacks were killed by police gunfire that year. 5. The percentage of blacks arrested for crimes is consistent with police reports. This is according to the National Crime Victimization Survey, as well as this 1985 study: \u201cEven allowing for the existence of discrimination in the criminal justice system, the higher rates of crime among black Americans cannot be denied,\u201d wrote James Q. Wilson and Richard Herrnstein in their classic 1985 study, \u201cCrime and Human Nature.\u201d \u201cEvery study of crime using official data shows blacks to be overrepresented among persons arrested, convicted, and imprisoned for street crimes.\u201d This was true decades before the authors put it to paper, and it remains the case decades later. \u201cThe overrepresentation of blacks among arrested persons persists throughout the criminal justice system,\u201d wrote Wilson and Herrnstein. \u201cThough prosecutors and judges may well make discriminatory judgments, such decisions do not account for more than a small fraction of the overrepresentation of blacks in prison.\u201d This data disproves the notion that racism is what drives higher rates of arrests among the blacks than among whites or broader America. 6. According to the FBI, \u201cBlack crime rates were lower in the 1940s and 1950s, when black poverty was higher\u201d and \u201cracial discrimination was rampant and legal.\u201d If it\u2019s not racism and poverty that are blame for the high black crime rate, then what is? ***7. According to Mac Donald, \u201cA straight line can be drawn between family breakdown and youth violence.\u201d Hence has nothing to do with white supremacy. As economist Thomas Sowell points out, before the 1960s \u201cmost black children were raised in two-parent families.\u201d In 2013, over 72 percent of blacks were born out of wedlock. In Cook County \u2013which Chicago belongs to \u2013 79 percent of blacks were born to single mothers in 2003, while only 15 percent of whites were born to single mothers. \u201cUntil that gap closes, the crime gap won\u2019t close, either,\u201d writes Mac Donald. When are we as a people from all different color pigment will stop labeling each other as a color which diminishes our self worth and start describing ourselves as Red Blooded Americans who are either male or female that\u2019s all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, Ricci and Tyler, I\u2019ll bite. I\u2019m going to accept all of your points before I dismantle them one by one:\n\nYou\u2019re not racist: If you\u2019re not racist, then you couldn\u2019t possibly believe that black people are somehow inherently or genetically more violent than whites. We know study after study shows that crime is a socioeconomic problem, so if blacks commit more violent crimes, could it possibly be that the black population is in a worse socioeconomic position than whites? You\u2019re not racist, remember, so it can\u2019t mean blacks are lazier, less willing to work or dumber, so what accounts for the disparity in income and education?\n\nBlack-on-black crime: Again, I accept your premise that blacks are responsible for black-on-black crime. But I must have missed your follow-up email that shows where black people don\u2019t care about that fact. I missed the part where you acknowledged that there are far more \u201cStop the violence\u201d marches and organizations dedicated to neighborhood violence than there are Black Lives Matter chapters. I probably turned a blind eye to your Twitter DM about anti-gang chapters. The message you sent about news organizations ignoring fraternal organizations, charities and nonprofits in black communities addressing these problems probably went into my spam folder. Strong black families are the cure: I agree with you on this one. In fact, I am working to put an end to all the black churches, black leaders and random influential Negroes who tell black people to keep fucking and stop caring for their kids. I\u2019ve never heard anyone say that, but conservatives and racists often bring it up as if black people don\u2019t care about these things, so it must be true. I\u2019m glad you agree with me on this one. Black people can\u2019t do two things at once: When black people talk about police-brutality and mass-incarceration rates, we ignore the impact that voting, community involvement and personal responsibility can have on our plight. Apparently, you two believe that black people focus on racism instead of concentrating on these other issues, and not in conjunction with them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRicci and Tyler, my point is this: You bring up these facts as if people who talk about racism aren\u2019t aware of them. As if we ignore them because we\u2019d rather blame everything on the white man. We don\u2019t. We know that part of the reason for the plight of black people in America is that we need to do better. We are trying to help each other do better. But when people like you two regurgitate the Fox News narrative that diminishes the role that white people, racism and the history of white supremacy in America play in black oppression, it is idiotic and tone-deaf.\n\nWhen you present this bullshit to black people as a counterargument to a discussion about police brutality or white supremacy, it means that you are either unaware that black people agree with these things, too, or it means that you are racist.\n\nAnd you can\u2019t be racist.\n\nI know this because Ricci said it, and Tyler proved it by sending me this picture of himself:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI did a Google Images search for this picture and found it all over the internet, including on the cover of a book. But I\u2019m sure Ty is a male model who just happens to dabble in statistical data that shows how dumb, violent and inferior black people are.\n\nHe\u2019s not a racist, though.\n\nEarlier this week, on the birthday of President Abraham Lincoln, staff writer Monique Judge took the opportunity to remind readers of the historical fact that the president called \u201cthe Great Emancipator\u201d did not free the slaves. Again, that is not her opinion; it is a fact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt did not go well.\n\nFrom: Andre Hickman The problem the problem with this article lies in the interpretation of The Human Condition. this false narrative that there are no white people who cared about black people during slavery or anytime before or after is completely dishonest and one sided.\n\nFrom Lincoln Gaffney: Monique, I sincerely do not know what you hope to accomplish with this piece. But assuming you care about equality among humans and this nation/world continuing on the path towards a \u2018more perfect union\u2019, I believe this kind of tone and content undercuts those aims that I care deeply about myself. To say Abraham Lincoln didn\u2019t care about black people is simply and factually false. The sad but unavoidable fact is that, in 1860, pretty much all politicians\u2014 even the more enlightened and radical among them like Lincoln, Chase, Seward\u2014 did not believe in overall equality of the \u2018races\u2019 Race is a myth that has been used to oppress and divide people over time; there is but one race, the human race; if you truly care about that idea becoming a reality, I would respectfully suggest not trying to make one of the most heroic and noble leaders ever in the US out to be a racist. Unlike the current Republican President, who actually is and is kinda proud of it. Lincoln was a radical in his time, and you are making him out to be the reactionary. It is unfair and I believe also hurtful to the propagation of equality. Peace, Lincoln Gaffney\n\nDearest Andre and Lincoln:\n\nI write to you from the darkest crevices of blackness, where neither light nor white tears dare approach. It is the two thousand and eighteenth year of our lord and saviors Desus & Mero, and you have taken time out of your busy schedule to inform a black woman that white people actually \u201ccared about black people during slavery.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs evidence, you point to ... umm ... well, nothing.\n\nLincoln was not against slavery. He was against the expansion of slavery. If he did not believe that blacks were subhuman pieces of property, or shouldn\u2019t be American citizens, he would not have offered to pay reparations to slaveholders and ship black people back to Africa.\n\nSince the beginning of the history of this great country, the overwhelming majority of white people in America have spent every day of their entire lives not shedding a bead of sweat to end slavery, Jim Crow or institutional racism. Lincoln, your \u201crespectful\u201d suggestion that Monique not \u201cmake one of the most heroic and noble leaders ever in the US out to be a racist\u201d simply means that you don\u2019t understand what racism is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImagine if you lived in a house with a group of bank robbers and shared the spoils of their robberies. You spent the money they stole and lived in the houses they bought with the cash. Not only that, but you knew about the bank robberies and said nothing, even when people asked you to help them stop the bank-robbing crew. You know what you\u2019d be called?\n\nNothing.\n\nYou\u2019re white.\n\nFinally, a comment regarding the following article:\n\nFrom: Dude at a Computer Honest question. At what point will the black population let go of the past? I\u2019m not asking for everyone to forget the past but stop using it as a crutch for societal and economic woes. I understand your points you made in the article but when will it actually end? I think it would help if we (everybody) were able to put a finger on it and say \u201cwhen we get here as a society, we can stop talking about the past (but never forget)\u201c? It does not have to end tomorrow, or next year or next decade. I\u2019m just wondering at what point can/should/will it stop?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Dude,\n\nUnlike the previous morons, you actually pose a salient question.

You act like every white man hates every black man. Let me tell you something, you don\u2019t understand how not all white people are racist, just like not all germs are harmful or bad for you. So do you want to give me a better explanation about how Obama improved race relations than me just sitting through an article about uninformed statements about white people waving confederate flags and whispering racist jokes? Joe\n\nLike you, I also believe that former President Barack Obama ruined race relations in America. I have a theory that I like to call the \u201cObama effect.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBetween my sophomore and junior years in college, I had a job at a paper factory. I was the only black guy in the department where these huge paper tubes were made. I didn\u2019t know shit about paper or pulp, but I have always been pretty swift when it comes to figuring shit out.\n\nThe white guys, who had been working in the plant for years, saw me as an interloper and privileged dude who had never worked a hard job in his life. They even nicknamed me \u201cWorm\u201d because I was so skinny that my knees buckled the first time I had to lift one of those tubes.\n\nBut after a while, they also noticed that whenever there was a problem, I could help solve it pretty quickly. Soon they made me a \u201crover\u201d\u2014someone who basically wandered around the floor and helped fix shit. Whenever anything went wrong, they would call for \u201cthe Worm.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept for one guy.\n\nOne guy couldn\u2019t stand to ask for help from me. I suspect it was because he was so racist that he couldn\u2019t accept the fact that a black guy could figure out a problem that he couldn\u2019t. He would ask anyone for help except me, but they would always tell him to \u201cask Worm.\u201d This motherfucker was so resistant that he started losing his production bonus rather than ask me for help. He would rather be broke.\n\nThat\u2019s the Obama effect.\n\nI believe that much of the hate Obama received had nothing to do with politics. It was because these people had never had a black guy telling them what to do, and despite the fact that he fixed the economy, killed America\u2019s greatest enemy and gave millions of Americans health care, they would rather fuck up themselves and the country than admit that he was a decent president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s how Obama ruined race relations. For white people like you, Joe, racism was this country\u2019s secret shame, like a man with a small penis.

Your hatrid for whites exudes from every pore. It is quite entertaining to watch, but I feel embarassed for you mostly. You are clearly a sociopath with narcisstic tendencies that thinks the entire world evolves around the struggles of the American black person. Are you struggling Mike? Really? You don\u2019t know struggle Mike. But you like to throw around those old tired words such as inequality, oppressed and racist. Yawn. There are people in today\u2019s world and historically that truly experienced those things, but not you Mike. You don\u2019t know struggle Mike. The reason you will never attain any respect or credibility is because you only think that you exist. Your selfish and self centered behavior refuses to allow you to notice the hundreds of other races in the world besides your own Mike. But you cannot see it and probably do not care. So, don\u2019t ask yourself why I don\u2019t care it either. You remind me of the person that Booker T. Washington was describing when he said: \u201cThere is another class of coloured people who make a business of keeping the troubles, the wrongs, and the hardships of the Negro race before the public. Having learned that they are able to make a living out of their troubles, they have grown into the settled habit of advertising their wrongs \u2014 partly because they want sympathy and partly because it pays. Some of these people do not want the Negro to lose his grievances, because they do not want to lose their jobs.\u201d This is you Mike. You make a living off of preaching hate and fueling the fire of division. Without it, you would be forced to find a new source of income, therefore, you choose to maximize the opportunity. Without this you offer nothing to the world. Is that what scares you Mike? All the skills you posses is being a race baiter? Come on man. You are better than that right? Get over yourself Mike. You will never win until you get out of the hole you have decided to live in. There are more races than just black and white Mike. You may want to pull your head out of your rear and notice how the hispanic race is blowing by you ever so quietly with wrecklace abandon, while you whine and complain. Best, Jorge\n\nWhen Jorge received no reply, he sent another message:\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nFrom: Jorge\n\nSubject: Hi Mike\n\n\n\nSILENCE...exactly.\n\nAnd this Twitter DM came from Brent:\n\nFrom: Brent Hello, I read one of your stories today and loved the way you over exaggerated it to make the readers feel your hatred. Yes some white people are definitely messed up and horribly racist but the only way the world will change for the better is to stop trying to create sides. I\u2019ve seen messed up stories made up by both sides. Don\u2019t be that guy. Your better then that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Jorge and Brent:\n\nI would like to fill you in on how I came to hate the whites:\n\nIt has been mentioned a few times in the comments sections that I was homeschooled until the age of 11. I was raised by a mother who was a combination of flower power hippie and Black Panther (not the T\u2019Challa one; the other kind). I lived in a black neighborhood. I had black friends. Although she taught me a lot about black people through osmosis and the huge collection of books in our home (I read The Autobiography of Malcolm X at age 7, and after reading the science fiction novel Soul of the Robot, I figured that Eldridge Cleaver\u2019s Soul on Ice couldn\u2019t be much different), she never really talked about white people at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I finally went to public school, I was supposed to be placed in the fifth grade but was skipped to the seventh. For the rest of my academic career, I was surrounded by white kids.\n\nAlthough white supremacy is inescapable in America, unlike most people, I had never spent any significant time around the whites. I was a black person who had never held any reverence, fear or respect for white people. Even after joining them in a scholastic setting, from high school through college, I never really met any white people who were especially smart or gifted. Being raised in a Caucasian-free bubble allowed me to view white people objectively, even more so than an immigrant would.\n\nBecause of this, I had many white friends, many of whom I am still close to. In fact, I\u2019d probably say I have more white friends than the average black person. Some of them are probably reading this right now. Almost all of them will tell you that I sometimes speak about race, politics and our differences without a filter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI say all of that to say this:\n\nWhen you read some of the things that I write, I know that my commentary often comes off as angry or belligerent, and I even understand why it seems that way:\n\nWhite people aren\u2019t used to anyone talking to them that way.\n\nMost people fashion conversations about anything in such a manner that they will be effective at changing the person\u2019s mind and get him or her to understand their viewpoint. As such, most conversations about race are tailored to appease white sensibilities. In a land built and sustained by white supremacy, the default setting is to discuss race in a way that caters to the sensibilities of the majority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFortunately\u2014or, in your case, unfortunately\u2014my upbringing was not entrenched in that way of thinking. I do not hate white people. I am simply unencumbered by the need to sidestep their sensibilities to make my point. White people are not my enemy. White people are not my friends. White people are not special to me. They are just people.\n\nSo when I write in this unapologetic, unfiltered way, it often offends the whites because they are not accustomed to being spoken to in such a manner. Because most of them are used to people\u2014especially minorities\u2014tiptoeing around their sensitivities to make a point, they interpret truth as anger.\n\nThat is white privilege.\n\nYes, I write about race. It\u2019s my job. Aside from that, I don\u2019t really think about white people that much. Sorry to burst your bubble, but I am not obsessed with race, any more than a carpenter is obsessed with wood. If you\u2019d like to believe that I walk around with a chip on my shoulder looking for ways to be offended by racism, I apologize.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJorge, I enjoyed your quote from Booker T. Washington. For most of his career, he was at odds with W.E.B. Du Bois on how they viewed America\u2019s race problem. Du Bois said of Washington, regarding the passage that you previously quoted:\n\nHis doctrine has tended to make the whites, North and South, shift the burden of the Negro problem to the Negro\u2019s shoulders and stand aside as critical and rather pessimistic spectators; when in fact the burden belongs to the nation, and the hands of none of us are clean if we bend not our energies to righting these great wrongs.\n\nIn all of your diatribe, you neglected to point out that racism does exist. If, by chance, it disappeared from the face of the earth, I would be happy to lose my job. I would even be delighted if racism withered away to a microscopic speck of bigotry undetectable to the human eye.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat hypothetical, tiny little bit of bigotry is also the size of the fuck I give about what you think of me.\n\nI get it from my mama.\n\nBe well.\n\nAnd finally, as promised, a bit of positive mail to end this week\u2019s mailbag:", "keywords": ["clapback", "blame", "roots", "obama", "racist", "dont", "mailbag", "mama", "mike", "know", "world", "race", "black", "white", "way"], "polarity": 0.04071927915148254, "subjectivity": 0.4846882464679076},

I was entertained by your writing and found myself laughing out loud a few times. I genuinely like your style of writing and will continue to read your pieces. But, as I read further into this piece I found myself getting more and more confused by your message. There was some obvious hate directed towards white people. I am a \u201cChad.\u201d I\u2019m about as Chad as they get. Like you, a Jamal, I had only one friend who was not like me. My one black friend, Tim, was the only black kid in our school. I can vividly recall the first time I knew he was different. It\u2019s when my Dad saw him and asked if there were other black kids at my school. That one question changed everything. It made me aware that Tim was supposedly different. Parents teach their kids when they don\u2019t even know it. As someone who considers themselves not racist, I teach my kids how to not be racist, prejudice, or an asshole by not acknowledging the difference in someone who is not white, heterosexual, or different in any way. If I were to point out their differences, it would be, at the very least, condescending. And I\u2019d be doing the same thing my Dad did to me, perpetuating prejudice. Its very frustrating to read about a generalization about white people and how they feel about black people. Why can\u2019t I read your column and just be entertained? Why do I have be lumped into a small group of people or made to feel ashamed or embarrassed to be white? I hate being hated for no reason. I realize that is exactly how you must feel. And that is how you very subtlely came accross. I\u2019m aware enough to know I\u2019m missing something. I\u2019m interested in hearing your take on this because I feel like you can honestly enlighten me as to why you feel the way you do about white people. And why you feel it\u2019s okay to generalize and lump us altogether. I challenge you to respond without bringing up what our shitty forefather\u2019s did, what previous generations did, or what you\u2019ve been told to believe. I want to hear what you have personally seen and experienced that makes you so comfortable in perpetuating prejudices. Thanks, Greg\n\nDearest Greg:\n\nFirst, I want to sincerely let you know that I am sorry that you are ashamed or embarrassed about your race. Unlike you, I honestly believe it\u2019s OK to be white.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a \u201cJamaal\u201d (you spelled it wrong, but that\u2019s OK), I also want to congratulate you for having one black friend way back in elementary school. On behalf of our entire Jamaal population, I offer our collective thanks for your charitable willingness to befriend someone who is black and to be so accepting of diversity that you remember the one black guy you rescued from the wild so many years ago. It moves me to tears every time I hear a heartwarming story like yours about how you were willing to adopt a Jamaal during your youth.\n\nAs for your challenge for me to respond without bringing up something your shitty forefathers did (again, you spelled it wrong; there was no need for that random apostrophe), I need some clarification on the matter.\n\nWould your dad be considered a \u201cforefather\u201d when he pointed out the race of your pet Tim? Because if parents teach their kids without even knowing it, as you claim, then it is obvious that yours taught you well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here is what I am trying to get at, Greg/Chad.\n\nYou cannot write me letters insinuating that I perpetuate racism against white people that permeates society and infects future generations while simultaneously asking why I am lumping you in with the fucked-up people who came before you. If one Jamaal like me can somehow make black people hate white people, then imagine the effect of an entire nation of Jamaals.\n\nImagine if, instead of writing on the internet, we Jamaals did this for the next four centuries: passing our hate down to our children. Imagine if we had Jamaal-only neighborhoods and caged the Chads into certain areas with underfunded schools and endemic poverty. Imagine if we threw job applications into the trash if they had the name Chad or Becky on them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only that, but what if every person named Jamaal benefited from the simple happenstance that they were named Jamaal? What if anyone named Jamaal could live anywhere they wanted, do whatever they wished and didn\u2019t have to worry about the random pitfalls of society because their name provided them immunity and privilege?\n\n\n\nAnd then one day, one of them overheard someone named Tim ...\n\nOr Chad ...\n\nOr Michael Harriot, telling people about the Jamaals.\n\nAnd after benefiting from being named Jamaal for a quadruple century, Jamaal sat down at his desk and typed a letter explaining how he lived in such privileged isolation from everyone else that he remembered the exact motherfucking day, time and year when he first encountered one of those poor, non-Jamaal savages, and took it in like a pet hamster, finally realizing that he lived in a Jamaal-based society.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow imagine, if you will, after all of that, this douchebag had stored up so much entitlement that he had the Jamaal-dacity to say to someone ... anyone:\n\n\u201cI heard what you said and I\u2019m offended. Now explain why you feel like that without mentioning anyone named Jamaal.\u201d\n\nJamaal, please.\n\nThis next letter is regarding the little girl who saw former first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s portrait and thought she was a queen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: j40oaks\n\nTo: Anne Branigin\n\nSubject: Oh ....

Also, your previous letter calling staff writer Monique Judge \u201cone of the most racist bitches to ever breath [sic]\u201d was in all capital letters. Your embrace of lowercase letters shows growth (we\u2019re still working on the ellipses, but that\u2019s a lesson you learn in sixth-grade grammar; you\u2019ll get there), but what I\u2019d like to know is:\n\nWhy are you like this?\n\nWho hurt you, j40? Did a black guy steal your college sweetheart? Were you cut from your middle school basketball team and replaced by a Negro with a superior vertical leap?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI want to applaud you for your candor, and for the fact that you embrace your racism. The majority of our hate mail includes the caveat \u201cI\u2019m not racist,\u201d but not yours, j40. I appreciate the fact that despite your obviously low IQ, your inability to dribble and being saddled with the gut-wrenching memory of watching Amber pose for prom pictures with DeMarcus, you know who you are: an unapologetic bigot.\n\nI recognize your hate for Michelle Obama. I know she didn\u2019t sign a single piece of legislation, have any role in governing or affect your life in any measurable way. I understand that it is her blackness that offends you (what else could it be?). The fact that a little girl could admire someone black must really eat away at your nerves.\n\nI have instructed Anne to stop destroying our country with this bullshit because\u2014even though the \u201cmillennial cupcakes\u201d appreciate positive stories\u2014I see now that you can\u2019t handle it. She will do better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this one, about ... something:\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nFrom: David\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Repent Michael you are a person of the baser sort who is so full of hatred and ungodliness that you cannot even think clearly. Your articles are so vile and disgusting and you are so full of yourself that you cannot even have any other thoughts than the ones you deceive yourself into thinking you are always right. You will have your judgement day and, as you kneel before the Lord Jesus Christ on that day, you will realize how foolish you were. It is not to late to repent, but I think you will only mock me and what I have written to you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I thanked him for his letter, he wrote back:\n\nI got to you I see and I am glad. You need to repent Michael and all those Lily white liberals who are falling all over themselves to praise you also need to repent. You have a lot of people who are so in love with you or else they feel so guilty about their deep seated prejudices towards black people that they are so afraid of offending you else they fear they may be found our. It is sickening to read all of these fawners and you eat it up with a spoon. I speak truth to you Michael and I am no bigot. I have lived around all kinds of people all if my life and I can spot a phony when I see one, of which you are. You have deep seated hatred in your heart for white folks and you don\u2019t sound as though you really know any. You disparage President Trump without even knowing what he is trying to do, and yet you give a pass to the last one who was in office and did nothing good for the black Americans who live in the inner cities. Eight years and he only did terrible corrupt things. He was more concerned about men being able to go into girls bathrooms. Ask the black Americans who live in Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore and other inner cities and ask them what he did for them. Nothing at all. Bring in anyone from any country and support them, but turn your back on our citizens. That is what he did. Hucksters like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson he loves. Also terrorists are his friends, but not Americans. Our new president is trying to put Americans first, or can\u2019t you see that Michael? You need to seek the truth because the truth is the only thing that will set you free. Jesus said that.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlease allow me to pray with you.\n\n\n\nDear White Jesus:\n\nI come to you, Lord, not only on my behalf, but on behalf of all my people who don\u2019t know how President Trump is saving this country. We ask you right now for your forgiveness, Lord.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForgive us for offending David, precious Caucasian savior. I know you said \u201cthe truth will set you free,\u201d which is why we are probably in this predicament right now, untanned Father. But now I finally see the light of your brave prophets, like David, who are out here fighting the good fight, alabaster Jesus. I trust him when he says he\u2019s \u201cno bigot,\u201d because I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something in your word about trusting motherfuckers who say they\u2019re not racist, precious lamb. I know it probably doesn\u2019t say \u201cmotherfucker,\u201d my Lord, and I know there\u2019s something about false prophets, but Imma ride with the \u201cno bigot\u201d thing for the rest of this prayer, Jesus.\n\nYour Highness, I thank you for saving me from choking when he talked about how great Trump is and said Barack Obama did \u201cterrible and corrupt things.\u201d\n\nLord, I need you right now!\n\nI need you to erase the notion that almost every time someone says they\u2019re not racist, then brings up Chicago, Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton and transgender bathrooms, they always turn out to be racist, Lord. But not David, sweet Jesus. He is your servant! He has shown me the love of Jesus, precious Father!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn T\u2019Challa\u2019s name, I pray.\n\nAmen\n\nAnd for our positive mail, I will give you a few pieces of mail I have featuring one recurring theme that we often receive: suggestions for names to call white people:\n\nFrom: Milkshakedave\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Two things: Dear Mr. Harriot, In your March 2 Clapback Mailbag, I read the following: \u201c...they would rather fuck up themselves and the country than admit that he was a decent president.\u201d Your assertion has been the only one I\u2019ve read that has come remotely close to explaining what I\u2019ve felt for the last couple of years is at the centre of the Trumpling mindset. (As an aside, I\u2019m very disappointed my \u2018Trumpling\u2019 insult/nickname hasn\u2019t stuck. Rhymes with \u2018dumpling\u2019. The boiled ball of dough served in gravy? Works on so many levels. Maybe it\u2019s not a thing in US cuisine.) This attitude that you expressed and I maintain is found all too frequently in domestic violence where the jilted ex pursues a murder-suicide solution by thinking \u201cIf I can\u2019t have her, no one can\u201d. In this case, the Trumplings as a collective, who because they feel threatened not being able to adapt to and cannot see themselves in a changed America, are saying: \u201cIf I can\u2019t have my America, then no one can\u201d... For what reason do Trumplings turn a blind eye to the innumerable contradictions, lies, and hypocrisy; to the unethical, unprincipled, and unlawful behaviour of Trump and the Republicans when the slightest whiff of such under Obama would have brought apoplectic screeches of outrage? Because, as you know, they do not want America to be for anyone other than themselves.\n\nFrom: Fakey McFake\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: none Hello, Mr. Harriot. I enjoy your writing on the Root. I had a stray thought that I share with you, only half jokingly. I do not feel there is an injurious-enough slur for white people. I am white. When I hear \u201chonky\u201d or \u201ccracker,\u201d I feel no insult. I do not care what a \u201chonky\u201d is, and \u201ccracker\u201d is just funny. However, if someone were to call me a \u201cTrump,\u201d I would lose my mind and turn red with anger. Perhaps one could start a campaign to install \u201cTrump\u201d as the worst possible slur one use for a white person, so that the name of this piece of human garbage will live infamy. Kind of like what the gay community did with Rick Santorum. This is probably a weird, terrible, divisive idea. In any case, keep up the great work. Don\u2019t ever call me a Trump.

This week\u2019s roundup of emails, comments, tweets and direct messages comes from white people who aren\u2019t racist; they just want the writers at The Root to stick to facts.\n\nFor insight, we collected a few of the people who set aside their disdain for our obvious lack of intelligence so that they could educate us on the truth. We wanted to highlight these unseen contributors as a way of thanking them for their continued support. Without you, where would we be?\n\nLet\u2019s read some mail.\n\nOur first set of correspondence doesn\u2019t relate to any particular post. In fact, we could do a Clapback Mailbag every day if we wanted to post the messages we receive from white people who want to share data about how fucked up black people are. These are only two examples. Warning: The first one is extremely long, but we included it because it is most representative of many of the emails we get regarding this subject.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA direct message from Twitter user @RicciBicci:\n\nAfrican Americans accounted for 52.5% of all homicide offenders from 1980 to 2008. Black people make up 12.5% of the population. Let that sink in... But go on dodge, duck and use the whatever excuse you want. An no I\u2019m not a racist etc so don\u2019t even use that card. Just think you are terrible for black people.\n\nAnd this:\n\nFrom: Tyler\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Black on Black Crime Michael, Please see my proven statistical response to your roots article on black on black crime. Also, you can see in my pic I am what you would call a black man 1. Data shows that 93 percent of black homicide victims are killed by other blacks. The left\u2019s rebuttal is that that 84 percent of white homicide victims are killed by other whites, but The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Jason Riley points outthat the white crime rate is \u201cmuch lower than the black rate.\u201d 2. FBI Statistics: \u201cBlacks commit violent crimes at 7 to 10 times the rate that whites do.\u201d Blacks committed 52 percent of homicides between 1980 and 2008, despite composing just 13 percent of the population. Across the same timeframe, whites committed 45 percent of homicides while composing 77% of the population, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Here are some more statistics from the FBI: In 2013, the FBI has black criminals carrying out 38 per cent of murders, compared to 31.1 per cent for whites. The offender\u2019s race was \u201cunknown\u201d in 29.1 per cent of cases. What about violent crime more generally? FBI arrest rates are one way into this. Over the last three years of data \u2013 2011 to 2013 \u2013 38.5 per cent of people arrested for murder, manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault were black. 3. Black crime is even more prevalent in the country\u2019s largest cities and counties. Heather Mac Donald writes in her book The War on Cops: How the New Attack on Law and Order Makes Everyone Less Safe that in Chicago, IL, blacks committed 76 percent of all homicides, despite composing 35 percent of the city\u2019s population. Blacks also accounted for 78 percent of all juvenile arrests. Whites, who compose 28 percent of the city\u2019s population, committed 4 percent of its homicides and 3.5 percent of its juvenile arrests. Hispanics, who compose 30 percent of the city\u2019s population, committed 19 percent of its homicides and 18 percent of its juvenile arrests. (Another eye-opening fact from Mac Donald\u2019s research is that only 26 percent of murder cases were solved in Chicago.) Blacks are 10 percent of the population in Los Angeles, CA, but commit 42 percent of its robberies and 34 percent of its felonies. Whites make up 29 percent of the city\u2019s population, and commit 5 percent of its robberies and 13 percent of its felonies. In New York City, blacks committed \u201c75 percent of all shootings, 70 percent of all robberies, and 66 percent of all violent crime,\u201d despite only composing 23 percent of the population, said Mac Donald in a Hillsdale speech. Additionally, 2009 Bureau of Justice Statistics numbers show that in 2009, \u201cblacks were charged with 62 percent of robberies, 57 percent of murders and 45 percent of assaults in the 75 biggest counties in the country, despite only comprising roughly 15 percent of the population in these counties.\u201d 4. There were almost 6,000 blacks killed by other blacks in 2015. By contrast, only 258 blacks were killed by police gunfire that year. 5. The percentage of blacks arrested for crimes is consistent with police reports. This is according to the National Crime Victimization Survey, as well as this 1985 study: \u201cEven allowing for the existence of discrimination in the criminal justice system, the higher rates of crime among black Americans cannot be denied,\u201d wrote James Q. Wilson and Richard Herrnstein in their classic 1985 study, \u201cCrime and Human Nature.\u201d \u201cEvery study of crime using official data shows blacks to be overrepresented among persons arrested, convicted, and imprisoned for street crimes.\u201d This was true decades before the authors put it to paper, and it remains the case decades later. \u201cThe overrepresentation of blacks among arrested persons persists throughout the criminal justice system,\u201d wrote Wilson and Herrnstein. \u201cThough prosecutors and judges may well make discriminatory judgments, such decisions do not account for more than a small fraction of the overrepresentation of blacks in prison.\u201d This data disproves the notion that racism is what drives higher rates of arrests among the blacks than among whites or broader America. 6. According to the FBI, \u201cBlack crime rates were lower in the 1940s and 1950s, when black poverty was higher\u201d and \u201cracial discrimination was rampant and legal.\u201d If it\u2019s not racism and poverty that are blame for the high black crime rate, then what is? ***7. According to Mac Donald, \u201cA straight line can be drawn between family breakdown and youth violence.\u201d Hence has nothing to do with white supremacy. As economist Thomas Sowell points out, before the 1960s \u201cmost black children were raised in two-parent families.\u201d In 2013, over 72 percent of blacks were born out of wedlock. In Cook County \u2013which Chicago belongs to \u2013 79 percent of blacks were born to single mothers in 2003, while only 15 percent of whites were born to single mothers. \u201cUntil that gap closes, the crime gap won\u2019t close, either,\u201d writes Mac Donald. When are we as a people from all different color pigment will stop labeling each other as a color which diminishes our self worth and start describing ourselves as Red Blooded Americans who are either male or female that\u2019s all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, Ricci and Tyler, I\u2019ll bite. I\u2019m going to accept all of your points before I dismantle them one by one:\n\nYou\u2019re not racist: If you\u2019re not racist, then you couldn\u2019t possibly believe that black people are somehow inherently or genetically more violent than whites. We know study after study shows that crime is a socioeconomic problem, so if blacks commit more violent crimes, could it possibly be that the black population is in a worse socioeconomic position than whites? You\u2019re not racist, remember, so it can\u2019t mean blacks are lazier, less willing to work or dumber, so what accounts for the disparity in income and education?\n\nBlack-on-black crime: Again, I accept your premise that blacks are responsible for black-on-black crime. But I must have missed your follow-up email that shows where black people don\u2019t care about that fact. I missed the part where you acknowledged that there are far more \u201cStop the violence\u201d marches and organizations dedicated to neighborhood violence than there are Black Lives Matter chapters. I probably turned a blind eye to your Twitter DM about anti-gang chapters. The message you sent about news organizations ignoring fraternal organizations, charities and nonprofits in black communities addressing these problems probably went into my spam folder. Strong black families are the cure: I agree with you on this one. In fact, I am working to put an end to all the black churches, black leaders and random influential Negroes who tell black people to keep fucking and stop caring for their kids. I\u2019ve never heard anyone say that, but conservatives and racists often bring it up as if black people don\u2019t care about these things, so it must be true. I\u2019m glad you agree with me on this one. Black people can\u2019t do two things at once: When black people talk about police-brutality and mass-incarceration rates, we ignore the impact that voting, community involvement and personal responsibility can have on our plight. Apparently, you two believe that black people focus on racism instead of concentrating on these other issues, and not in conjunction with them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRicci and Tyler, my point is this: You bring up these facts as if people who talk about racism aren\u2019t aware of them. As if we ignore them because we\u2019d rather blame everything on the white man. We don\u2019t. We know that part of the reason for the plight of black people in America is that we need to do better. We are trying to help each other do better. But when people like you two regurgitate the Fox News narrative that diminishes the role that white people, racism and the history of white supremacy in America play in black oppression, it is idiotic and tone-deaf.\n\nWhen you present this bullshit to black people as a counterargument to a discussion about police brutality or white supremacy, it means that you are either unaware that black people agree with these things, too, or it means that you are racist.\n\nAnd you can\u2019t be racist.\n\nI know this because Ricci said it, and Tyler proved it by sending me this picture of himself:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI did a Google Images search for this picture and found it all over the internet, including on the cover of a book. But I\u2019m sure Ty is a male model who just happens to dabble in statistical data that shows how dumb, violent and inferior black people are.\n\nHe\u2019s not a racist, though.\n\nEarlier this week, on the birthday of President Abraham Lincoln, staff writer Monique Judge took the opportunity to remind readers of the historical fact that the president called \u201cthe Great Emancipator\u201d did not free the slaves. Again, that is not her opinion; it is a fact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt did not go well.\n\nFrom: Andre Hickman The problem the problem with this article lies in the interpretation of The Human Condition. this false narrative that there are no white people who cared about black people during slavery or anytime before or after is completely dishonest and one sided.\n\nFrom Lincoln Gaffney: Monique, I sincerely do not know what you hope to accomplish with this piece. But assuming you care about equality among humans and this nation/world continuing on the path towards a \u2018more perfect union\u2019, I believe this kind of tone and content undercuts those aims that I care deeply about myself. To say Abraham Lincoln didn\u2019t care about black people is simply and factually false. The sad but unavoidable fact is that, in 1860, pretty much all politicians\u2014 even the more enlightened and radical among them like Lincoln, Chase, Seward\u2014 did not believe in overall equality of the \u2018races\u2019 Race is a myth that has been used to oppress and divide people over time; there is but one race, the human race; if you truly care about that idea becoming a reality, I would respectfully suggest not trying to make one of the most heroic and noble leaders ever in the US out to be a racist. Unlike the current Republican President, who actually is and is kinda proud of it. Lincoln was a radical in his time, and you are making him out to be the reactionary. It is unfair and I believe also hurtful to the propagation of equality. Peace, Lincoln Gaffney\n\nDearest Andre and Lincoln:\n\nI write to you from the darkest crevices of blackness, where neither light nor white tears dare approach. It is the two thousand and eighteenth year of our lord and saviors Desus & Mero, and you have taken time out of your busy schedule to inform a black woman that white people actually \u201ccared about black people during slavery.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs evidence, you point to ... umm ... well, nothing.\n\nLincoln was not against slavery. He was against the expansion of slavery. If he did not believe that blacks were subhuman pieces of property, or shouldn\u2019t be American citizens, he would not have offered to pay reparations to slaveholders and ship black people back to Africa.\n\nSince the beginning of the history of this great country, the overwhelming majority of white people in America have spent every day of their entire lives not shedding a bead of sweat to end slavery, Jim Crow or institutional racism. Lincoln, your \u201crespectful\u201d suggestion that Monique not \u201cmake one of the most heroic and noble leaders ever in the US out to be a racist\u201d simply means that you don\u2019t understand what racism is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImagine if you lived in a house with a group of bank robbers and shared the spoils of their robberies. You spent the money they stole and lived in the houses they bought with the cash. Not only that, but you knew about the bank robberies and said nothing, even when people asked you to help them stop the bank-robbing crew. You know what you\u2019d be called?\n\nNothing.\n\nYou\u2019re white.\n\nFinally, a comment regarding the following article:\n\nFrom: Dude at a Computer Honest question. At what point will the black population let go of the past? I\u2019m not asking for everyone to forget the past but stop using it as a crutch for societal and economic woes. I understand your points you made in the article but when will it actually end? I think it would help if we (everybody) were able to put a finger on it and say \u201cwhen we get here as a society, we can stop talking about the past (but never forget)\u201c? It does not have to end tomorrow, or next year or next decade. I\u2019m just wondering at what point can/should/will it stop?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Dude,\n\nUnlike the previous morons, you actually pose a salient question. While I cannot give an exact date, I can give you a list of markers that will indicate when black people will ultimately let go of the past and stop using it as a crutch:\n\nwhen black children are afforded the opportunity to attend schools in black neighborhoods that are funded as well as white schools;\n\nwhen the black unemployment rate is equal to the white unemployment rate;\n\nwhen black people with the same education and experience aren\u2019t paid less than their white counterparts;\n\nwhen police don\u2019t shoot black men disproportionately regardless of the crime rate;\n\nwhen employers stop throwing r\u00e9sum\u00e9s with black-sounding names in the garbage;\n\nwhen white women in parking lots don\u2019t clutch their purses when I walk by;\n\nwhen people like you stop coming to black websites to read about racism and end up butt-hurt;\n\nwhen white people stop telling black people how to react to their oppression;\n\nwhen the history of what white people have done to blacks for 500 years is no longer regarded by whites as inconsequential as they explain away white supremacy by using the Constitution, laws and the legacy of \u201cWestern civilization\u201d;\n\nwhen I, as a black man, can finally believe that my work, my children\u2019s existence and my entire life are totally and completely unaffected by the color of my skin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil then ...\n\nI\u2019ll see you next week.", "keywords": ["clapback", "population", "roots", "blacks", "stop", "racism", "racist", "whites", "lincoln", "mailbag", "facts", "crime", "black", "white"], "polarity": -0.005896180591062515, "subjectivity": 0.4246456834941086},

Remember I loved you all!*\n\n* (Unless Yesha\u2019s reading this.)\n\nThis first item is meant to address one of the most frequent complaints received by The Root. I have been emailed by numerous white women arguing the same point, which is the most white-womanish point ever:\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nFrom L. Greenbow\n\nSubject: Your hate for white women I am numb to your treatment of white women because you want to throw stones at them so much that people don\u2019t pay attention to it anymore. What bothers me it when you keep pushing the narrative that 53% of white women voted for Trump. That is not the case. 53% of white women voters voted for Trump. Most white women did not vote for him because only a small porecetage one the population votes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd here is another comment from a reader named \u201cGet some Dak Sausage,\u201d who posted about it multiple times in a post that had nothing to do with Donald Trump, white women or even politics. They complained about Senior Editor Stephen Crockett\u2019s use of the stat in several comments:\n\nYes. I\u2019m saying that factually roughly 25% of white women voted for Trump. That\u2019s a fact. I\u2019m not talking about how complicit everyone feels the roughly half of white women that didn\u2019t vote are.\n\nDear L and Get:\n\nI apologize sincerely from the bottom of my heart. When I wrote that 53 percent of white women voted for Trump, I made a mistake. In my haste to be accurate and fair, I may have sullied the good name of the Caucasian sheroes who historically get to benefit from the conquering, colonizing white supremacist manifest destiny embedded in their male counterparts without bloodying their hands or mussing their silky blond hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI meant \u201cwhite women.\u201d\n\nI know that white women enjoy an unparalleled entitlement gifted to them at birth that follows them around for their entire lives. It\u2019s not even their fault. It\u2019s society\u2019s fault. White women are the shit. Even a balloon-shaped Becky gets to be a trophy for\u2014if no one else\u2014a self-hating black man. Our last two first ladies have been an Ivy League-educated attorney and a plain-old skinny, generic, white mail-order bride Trump got from eBay. White women have it made.\n\nBut even though they don\u2019t have to adhere to the rules of society, they at least have to acknowledge the existence of the motherfucking language. The language of politics and democracy doesn\u2019t genuflect simply because you have an oatmeal-colored vagina.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I say, \u201cThe Atlanta Falcons blew a 23-point lead in the Super Bowl,\u201d the players who didn\u2019t get in the game never email me saying: \u201cI was on the bench. I didn\u2019t have anything to do with that.\u201d When Trump says he was \u201celected by the American people,\u201d he doesn\u2019t parse it by saying, \u201cThe less-than-half who voted for me.\u201d When people say Barack Obama \u201cwon the black vote,\u201d Omarosa, Ben Carson, and Diamond and Silk didn\u2019t raise their hands to object. That\u2019s not how teams work. That\u2019s not how democracy works. That\u2019s not how anything else works.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, let\u2019s say I agreed with your premise. Doesn\u2019t that make white women more complicit? Who should I absolve? The white women who would have voted for Hillary Clinton but stayed their asses home?\n\nWhite people voted for Trump. White women voted for Trump. You should be glad Stephen and I say \u201c53 percent of white women\u201d instead of calling them by the name I suggested:\n\n\u201cThose blood-sucking, privileged-assed, low-key-racist white heauxs.\u201d\n\nFrom: Dees Nuts\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: MLK to Black people The only White people MLK did not hate were the underage prostitute whores he would beat and torture fuck.

BUT THUS FAR ONLY THE WHITE COUNTRIES ARE GENEROUS AND KNOW THE WAY OF GIVE NOT GET.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this:\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nFrom: Adolph Crackerjack\n\nSubject: The difference between white men and everyone else White men live their lives. They go about their business, and for the most part never consider their race. To a white man he is merely another human. I certainty never though much about race until I got tired of my people being denigrated at every turn. White people are the only race of people taught to hate and disrespect their own ancestors and history. But women, all women see life through the lens of being a women not a human. For black people everything centers around being black. Gays and lesbians build their entire existence around the fact they are homosexual. Muslims are completely consumed by Islam. Meanwhile, the white man is a blank slate navigating life based on logic and experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNah, the difference between white men and and everyone else is this:\n\nYou believe you get to control the world.\n\nThat\u2019s it. You think you can rape, kill, pillage, steal, colonize and enslave at your will. It is in your DNA. You are the scourge of the earth. You tortured my ancestors, raped Africa, committed genocide against the Jews, Native Americans, Haitians, every island in the Caribbean, the Aztecs, the Inca, the Aborigine and every native population on earth. You are the destruction of the planet. If the devil has a face, he is a white man. You will one day pay for your misdeeds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m just kidding.\n\nI know you two letter writers didn\u2019t do any of that, just like I know Joseph hasn\u2019t invented anything in his life. He doesn\u2019t even have the technical literacy to find the \u201ccaps lock\u201d key, so I know he\u2019s not creating anything in his garage, unless you count meth. I don\u2019t.\n\nMy point is that Joseph and Adolph don\u2019t get to live by two sets of rules. They don\u2019t get to enjoy the privilege of individuality by dissociating themselves from Nazis, domestic terrorists and white supremacists and then castigate others by lumping all other groups into a basket based on stereotypes. So I say this to all white people:\n\nPick one.\n\nEven though I am an educated black man with an IQ high enough to hit the \u201cshift\u201d key, I\u2019m fine with you thinking I might be a stupid gangbanger or a criminal. But if we are going to play that game, you have to admit your personal responsibility for every \u201cshithole\u201d around the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf I am to be a thug, then you have to admit that you are Adolf Hitler and the Ku Klux Klan. If an individual Muslim should automatically be assumed to be a terrorist, then I should assume that all white men are the same as the scum who dragged Emmett Till out of bed or slaughtered billions of babies around the world to make way for white rule.\n\nI\u2019m not accusing you, or any white person, of anything. I\u2019m just saying: If we are going to play the game, pick a set of rules so that I can know which game we are playing.\n\nAnd for God\u2019s sake, hit the goddamn \u201ccaps lock\u201d key!", "keywords": ["horribles", "clapback", "roots", "whites", "basket", "mailbag", "trump", "know", "women", "voted", "men", "black", "white", "im", "say"], "polarity": 0.0025409052312605736, "subjectivity": 0.3439361794437936},

On Tuesday the Alabama Senate race took place. Roy Moore, a repugnant alleged serial child molester who believes that women should not have the right to vote, civil rights should be scrapped and slavery was lit, lost by a hair. Doug Jones, Moore\u2019s opponent, was carried to victory by black folks\u2014specifically black women. Exit polls showed that 98 percent of black women voted for Jones, as compared with 93 percent of black men, 35 percent of white women and 27 percent of white men.\n\n\n\nListen closely. Do you hear it? That, my friend, is the sound of hundreds upon thousands of black women letting out a resounding \u201cWe tried to tell y\u2019all.\u201d\n\nEvery time there is something good in this world\u2014know that black women probably did it first, said it first, seent it first. Someone was so sure about this that they put it on a T-shirt. Conversely, most negative things in this world, black women tried to save you from.\n\nIt was Anita Hill who exposed the predatory nature of men on Capitol Hill, long before Monica Lewinsky\u2019s heels ever stepped on the carpets of the Oval Office. It was Tarana Burke who sent the first #MeToo into the world, 10 years before the movement was appropriated by white feminism. Twenty years prior to the pink pussy hats that filled the streets of our nation\u2019s capital, 750,000 black women gathered for their Million Woman March.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, black women were the only demographic that vehemently opposed the election of Donald Trump, and exemplified that in their votes. And 94 percent of black women voted for Hillary Clinton\u201412 more percentage points than black men and over 20 more percentage points than the Latina and Latino population. It is unclear why J. Cole\u2019s \u201cNo Role Modelz\u201d isn\u2019t consistently at the top of the charts\u2014because clearly, this nation don\u2019t wanna be saved.\n\nTrump\u2019s slogan betrays him because it belongs to black women. We have been trying to make America great from the jump. So much nonsense could be avoided if this nation listened to us. There is something unique about black women. Like our male counterparts, we built this nation. However, black women also raised it. We nursed and bathed its children\u2014both black and white\u2014fed its workforce and cleaned its households. We know more about black men, white men and white women than they know about themselves. Therefore, we are in a special position to predict the unknown, advise the unknowledgeable and reshape the unseen future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt would seem that these traits would make America treasure us, holding us up as a pinnacle of wisdom. Instead, as Malcolm X said:\n\nThe most disrespected person in America is the black woman. The most unprotected person in America is the black woman. The most neglected person in America is the black woman.\n\nAnd that\u2019s on a good day. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nThe most disrespected person in America is the black woman.\n\nAs black women, policed by Eurocentric beauty standards, we are routinely attacked for our appearances. Michelle Obama, Rep. Maxine Waters and Leslie Jones are just a few examples of black women whom the internet and media have dragged for filth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur spirited personalities are denounced as inappropriately dominant. Our strong leadership is constantly reduced to words like \u201ccontrolling\u201d and \u201cpushy,\u201d rather than being seen for what it is: dynamic.\n\nSojourner Truth, in her \u201cAin\u2019t I a Woman\u201d speech, conveyed that society claims that women are to be coddled, put on a pedestal and given the best treatment that society has to offer, but no one ever does that for black women. In fact, when it is done for black women, it\u2019s \u201ccorny\u201d\u2014what people call Russell Wilson\u2019s excellent treatment of Ciara. Aren\u2019t we women, too? Do we not deserve to be cherished?\n\n\n\nThe most unprotected person in America is the black woman.\n\nSince slavery, the black woman has been unprotected. We bore whips and savage rape from white slave masters. Our children were ripped away from us and sold as property. We became the targets of forced sterilization, the government\u2019s horrific plan for population control. Our households\u2019 resources waned under the strain of the systemic underemployment and mass incarceration of black men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresently, our own community has the audacity to continue this heinous legacy. Sixty percent of black girls experience sexual abuse at the hands of black men before the age of 18. Yet these perpetrators rarely face consequences, because black women instinctively protect black men from white supremacy and imprisonment. Intimate-partner violence is the leading cause of death for black women. Yet these victims are rarely depicted as innocent but, rather, as emasculating, domineering, mouthy instigators.\n\nWe are even punished if we try to protect ourselves, like Marissa Alexander, who received 20 years in prison for firing a warning shot into the air to ward off her violent ex-spouse, or Cyntoia Brown, who is serving a life sentence for shooting a man who purchased her for sex from a sex trafficking ring when she was 16.\n\nBlack Women in Alabama Saved Themselves Last Night If you\u2019ve kept up with how black women roll in American politics, what happened in Alabama last\u2026 Read more Read\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most neglected person in America is the black woman.\n\nBlack women are often erased from movements we create and/or prop up. Why is it that we can rattle off facts about Malcolm, Martin and Medgar, but rarely hear about the women of the civil rights movement? It was Amelia Boynton who wrote to Martin Luther King Jr., convincing him to come to Selma, Ala., yet there is no mention of her in most movies and textbooks. It was Autherine Lucy Foster who suggested laying Jimmie Lee Jackson\u2019s body on the steps of the Alabama state Capitol, but the idea is often credited to James Bevel. Men may have been the faces of this movement, but women were the strategists.\n\nAfter the 2016 presidential election, white women rushed to adorn Susan B. Anthony\u2019s grave with \u201cI Voted\u201d stickers, but where were the stickers for Shirley Chisholm, Fannie Lou Hamer, Sojourner Truth, Ida B. Wells and Mary Church Terrell\u2014who fought for women\u2019s right to vote even when the racist suffrage movement left them out?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is mirrored today. The Black Lives Matter movement, founded by three black women, is often tied to DeRay Mckesson and Shaun King. #MeToo was founded by Tarana Burke, a black woman, yet its appropriation by white women leaves people out who look like its very founder. White utterances of #MeToo have stripped some of the most notorious men of their power and influence, yet when Lupita Nyong\u2019o and Aurora Perrineau came forward, they were swiftly decried as liars. Black women must alway work twice as hard to get half as far and hope that no one falsely claims even that small victory for themselves.\n\nMaya Pope described America\u2019s relationship with black women best in Scandal\u2019s season 6 finale:\n\nI tell you \u2026 being a black woman. \u201cBe strong,\u201d they say. Support your men. Raise a man. Think like a man. Well, damn. I gotta do all that? Who\u2019s out here working for me? Carrying my burden? Building me up when I get down? Nobody. Black women out here trying to save everybody. We still try. Try to help all y\u2019all, even when we get nothing. God forbid you let a sista like me help you out. No, you don\u2019t want that. Don\u2019t let me put you on my back when you fall, wipe the crust out of your eye, put a pep back in your step. Because when we do, you resent us for making you better, smarter, stronger; then drop us so you can be with someone basic. Someone without all that baggage you left us with. But we still try.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nW.E.B. Du Bois once said that on judgment day, he would forgive slavery, but what he could never forgive was the \u201cpersistent insulting of black womanhood.\u201d And neither can I. There will come a day when the same nation that stepped on black women will run, shouting, at our doors to save it.

Trump is what happens when a nation lies to itself about the depth of its character.\n\nAnd as the hand-wringing \u201cHow did this happen\u201d hysteria reaches full force, that has never been more apparent than in this moment. Since August of last year, it has been clear that a Trump presidency was possible. He is neither an anomaly nor some freak of nature, but an embodiment of everything that the United States tries to pretend it is not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what we have seen in the hours since Trump\u2019s victory is white America\u2014particularly the underwhelming number of white women who showed up for Hillary Clinton\u2014refusing to admit how deeply embedded white supremacy is in the fabric of this country and how deeply racist some of their sister suffragettes are.\n\nInstead, too many of them are trying to blame anyone and anything for Hillary Clinton\u2019s Electoral College loss\u2014third parties, nonvoters, the FBI, Russia, WikiLeaks\u2014anything except whiteness.\n\nThese things may have factored into the outcome\u2014as did voter suppression across the country in the wake of the 2013 Supreme Court decision to gut the Voting Rights Act\u2014but they didn\u2019t determine the outcome. White America is supremely uncomfortable facing itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the \u201cBlack voters will be a problem for Clinton\u201d narrative was proved false, mainstream media quickly pivoted to describing working-class white voters as the victims of this election. MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews has been one the most ardent voices insisting that white voters in the Rust Belt felt \u201cabandoned\u201d and that that\u2019s the reason Trump was able to upset the Clinton establishment.\n\nWe, of course, can talk about these \u201csalt-of-the-earth\u201d white men whom Matthews and others have romanticized. We can talk about Clinton not fitting into the anti-war, anti-corporate progressive movement that is happening among white Bernie Sanders voters who have discovered revolution. But to focus solely on these two groups is a deflection from what exit polls show and what many of us already knew. Despite the prevailing liberal elitist argument that illiterate, backwoods crackers elected Trump, the lie-detector test determined that that is a lie\u2014or, at the very least, not completely true.\n\nThis nation can be under no illusions here: Trump appealed to overt white supremacy, patriarchy and hypercapitalism and turned almost the entire map red.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe won because wealthy white men wanted to solidify their power. He won because the most educated white people wanted to ensure their dominance. He won because, overwhelmingly, white women secretly hate powerful white women when they do not have that power in their own lives or in their own homes\u2014but, also, because many white women, despite their collective cries of victimhood, are also undercover white supremacists.\n\nIt is past time that these undercover, \u201cnice\u201d racists\u2014the two-faced electorate that claims blue but turns red when the lights go off\u2014are called out. More importantly, it is past time that we reckon with the reality that W.E.B. Du Bois warned us about in 1956: \u201cDemocracy has so far disappeared in the United States that no \u2018two evils\u2019 exist. There is but one evil party with two names, and it will be elected despite all I can do or say.\u201d\n\nClinton has already told her supporters to respect democracy and the \u201cpeaceful transfer of power.\u201d During her concession speech, she implored liberals and progressives to approach the next four years with an open mind and give Trump the \u201cchance to lead\u201d\u2014despite the expectation that he will sentence justice to the death penalty and women\u2019s rights to the trash bin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in his response to Trump\u2019s win, President Barack Obama said, \u201cWe have to remember that we\u2019re all on one team. This is an intramural scrimmage. We\u2019re not Democrats first. We\u2019re not Republicans first. We are Americans first. We\u2019re patriots first.\u201d\n\nSee, our so-called democracy may demand negative peace and complicity masquerading as collective advancement in order to survive, but somebody lied. We are not \u201call on one team,\u201d and we never have been. This is why this farce of a two-party system must be dismantled\u2014so Democrats and Republicans can stop scrimmaging while people\u2019s lives are at stake.\n\nThe middle ground of centrism has always included covert concessions to white supremacy, which is what makes it so dangerous for the most-targeted and vulnerable communities of color in this country. Over the course of the election cycle, the Democratic Party did all it could to ridicule and suppress progressive voices, while seeking to \u201cunderstand\u201d and create space for the \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d that have been let off their leashes across the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack activists were asking for too much; immigration activists were asking for too much; indigenous tribes were asking for too much; working-class people were asking for too much. And #NeverTrump provided a shield. White liberals didn\u2019t have to be anti-racist, they just had to be \u201cwith her,\u201d and there were many of them who became angry and condescending and as openly antagonistic as Trump supporters when they were told that just being \u201cwith her\u201d wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nContrary to popular opinion, I do not believe that Trump is a far-right-wing ideologue, and have consistently said that Mike Pence, and even Ted Cruz, were dangerous in more insidious ways. No, Trump is a morally bankrupt entertainer for sale who trafficked in racism, wallowed in corruption and incited white nationalist violence across the country to gain power.\n\nAs I wrote previously, \u201cTrump supporters are either frenzied with rage and bigotry or rationalizing rage and bigotry; there is no in-between,\u201d and the Democrats are in the market for those votes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1992, Bill Clinton siphoned white supremacist capitalist votes away from the GOP and ushered in the Democratic Party\u2019s Third Way era. He became the overseer of mass incarceration, which still has its tentacles embedded in communities of color\u2014and the strategy was to create a coalition with moderate, St. Reagan-loving Republicans who just wanted to make America great again.\n\nSo, what does that mean in today\u2019s social-political climate?\n\nIt means that white America is having a conversation with itself. People of color are welcome to join that conversation\u2014for appearances\u2014but they won\u2019t be welcome to change it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt means that welfare reform will once again become a Democratic issue, as it did under Bill Clinton. It means that for-profit prisons are back in business\u2014bigly. It means that Big Business\u2122 will openly take its seat at the Democratic table that it owns. Whatever needs to be done, whatever machinations are needed to put the party back in power in the 2018 midterms and beyond, will be employed.\n\nThe diversification of white supremacy will continue to be central to the party\u2019s strategy. There will be new black faces, new Latinx faces, new female faces, but there will be no serious campaign talk of social justice or criminal-justice reform or environmental racism because the party has picked its white pigeon to pluck. There will be no serious talk of humane and progressive immigration strategy; in fact, we\u2019ll hear more and more about enforcement. President Obama\u2019s legacy of night raids, detentions and deportations\u2014which could explain why Trump received more of the Latinx vote than Mitt Romney in 2012\u2014will continue.\n\nAs close as the vote was in battleground states, there was a chance that embracing a Poor People\u2019s Campaign in the tradition of Martin Luther King Jr. and Marian Wright Edelman would have changed the outcome for Hillary Clinton.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was a chance that a stronger anti-imperialist campaign, including a commitment to protecting the rights and lands of indigenous people, would have swayed a few votes on the left.\n\nThere was a chance that a stronger commitment to divest from police departments and make them pay the consequences of their militarized occupations in communities of color would have driven the black vote percentage up by a few points.\n\nThere was a chance that a stronger commitment to fight for health care, education and economic equity in the rural, red South would have swayed some votes Clinton\u2019s way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, in the age of Black Lives Matter; the Sanders revolution; and indigenous, immigration and global movements for freedom and justice, the Democratic Party continued to bet on lukewarm liberalism\u2014a move transparent to both the left and the right\u2014and lost to a white supremacy that never compromises. And if history tells the tale\u2014and the mainstream media narrative being spun at this very moment takes root\u2014it is clear that the party is not going to take any chances.\n\nNow, as the fox and the wolf collude in the interest of \u201cdemocracy,\u201d everyone invested in this political duopoly will have to decide which deals to make with the devil\u2014but first we must call it by name.\n\nGood morning, America.

I\u2019m extremely disappointed that you feel the need to perpetuate the racial divide in this country. Admittedly, I\u2019m a white man. Not a white man of privilege, but a whit man nonetheless. I am a descendant of immigrants who came to this country with nothing and managed to build a lineage if success. It wasn\u2019t immediate and it wasn\u2019t easy. It took generations. I grew up on the east coast in some of the most diverse neighborhoods our nation had at the time. I shared classrooms and meals with people of color. As an adult, my home has always been open to people\u2019s of any origin, race, faith and sexual orientation. My son is gay. I admit that we all have our biases and some in this country have faced prejudices that I never will. That said, I have now read much of your work and can come to only one conclusion.. shame on you. Your work will do NOTHING to bring us together as a people. You clearly embrace the division because it gives you a platform. You are obviously an educated and articulate man. Unfortunately, you have chosen to use those abilities to perpetuate the division you claim to abhor. It is my hope that you see that your writings are not unifying or constructive. You have a platform to drive change.. instead you choose to perpetuate stereotypes.\n\nFrom: Michael G\n\nTo: Michael H.\n\nSubject Open Letter to White People Dear Michael, I find myself writing today in response to your article. I have to say that as a white man I cannot begin to understand the struggles that people of color are still going through. That being said, I wholeheartedly believe that within every individual is the ability to change their circumstances. If someone lives in the inner city and needs to get away, they can. If gangs are part of the equation, again, move. No one said this would be easy or cheap, but for the sake of children, what price? The people keeping the minorities down are the politicians and their rich friends who put just enough money into local schools so they don\u2019t close, and also they do things like dump $$ into Black Lives Matter. They want minorities to stay down. Stay angry. It\u2019s a cash cow for them. I truly wish we could all get along. Black Panther is just another cash cow for more elitist old white guys who conceptualized, bankrolled, cast, wrote, and on ad nauseum. I apologize for the rant, but I don\u2019t think that all whites are cut from the same cloth. But, being angry is usually the beginning of a fight. Thank you for your time. Michael\n\nBut of all the people who were angry, the people who believed the letter was addressed directly to them were the funniest:\n\nFrom: Tina To: Michael Don\u2019t lump. me in with white people.

The white people I & My husband know are SO FAR AWAY FROM BEING RACIST, IT\u2019S NOT EVEN LAUGHABLE. But for YOU to call ME a RACIST IS SO BEYOND FUNNY, IT\u2019S NOT EVEN FUNNY.

Right?Again.....The HOLLOWAYS\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter I didn\u2019t answer, she wrote back:\n\nFrom: Starlene\n\nTo: Michael harriot\n\nSubject: I just reported you for calling me A RACIST. NO ONE CALLS ME A RACIST! I Will bet you money that you do not believe in JESUS CHRIST. I can practically guarantee you know nothing about JESUS CHRIST/GOD.Do u know how to get into HEAVEN?I guarantee you do not. I will pray for you,cause I already feel & know YOU need help extremely badly. I already know that you will not send me back a comment. Right? Mrs.HOLLOWAY. AND how DARE you call the HOLLOWAYS -BITCH? We ARE a Famous family that you will NEVER hear of. We are quite people. PERIOD.\n\nOK, guys, as one of the world\u2019s foremost reverse racists, I would never diminish your pain. Although I would chop off my left pinky toe for the privilege of scanning the landscape of everything that offends me and black people and deciding that the biggest act of racism is an article about a movie about a fictional character in a fictional country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt must be nice.\n\nBut I\u2019ll be honest with you guys: I\u2019m not tired of you. Your words affect me in no way, and there is a very good reason why:\n\nEven though I think the fragility of Caucasians and their unwillingness to dismantle or accept their part in creating and upholding a worldwide system of evil, oppression and hate is hilarious, it is not overwhelming. The Root receives far more positive correspondences from people\u2014both black and white\u2014who appreciate the work we do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sorry to inform you that I will not be clapping back this week. Instead, I have outsourced this week\u2019s clapback to these three individuals:\n\nFrom: Susie\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Thank You Michael, I just want to send my thanks to you because I have learned so much by reading your articles. I am a white woman who does anti-racism work with adults and children (on a multi-racial team). I thought because I did this type of work for a living I was anti-racist and doing my part. Your writing has made me realize that I have so much further to go on my journey to be anti-racist. I have been reading your column for a year now and it has made me a better person. I think of your writing and you when I make that quick decision-Should I say something? Should I show up for that? Now, I always do. Sometimes I fumble through my words and get nervous and don\u2019t always make the point I meant to-but with your words ringing in my ears I never stay silent. As a way of saying thanks, I made a donation to the #BlackPantherChallenge in your honor. I wish I could do more. With gratitude Susie\n\nAnd this:\n\nFrom: Nicholans\n\nTo: Daniele Belton\n\nSubject: Prolly Just another Chad ... But trying not to beHello Ms. Belton,I am writing you today because I have been finding myself on TheRoot.com more and more every day. While at first, I must admit that I felt as though there was a tone of reverse racism in the many articles I have read, especially from Damon Young, and Michael Harriot, I pushed through knowing that further information will conclude that I am simply another Chad who grew up color blind and not knowing I was sitting there oblivious to the atmosphere the black community as a whole is still feeling in this country. Growing up in Southern California through the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, racial tensions are nothing new to me, however, my naivety did have me thinking they had improved. Especially with the election of President Obama, and his rise to prominence being achieved not only through the black community striving to have their voices heard and their votes acknowledged, but also because of those of many other races and backgrounds getting woke by the increasingly obvious racism that has come into further light in recent years due to social media and the internet. Growing up in a predominantly black neighborhood, and a very different cultural environment, when I moved to a new place that was predominantly white, I was finally faced with white privilege, and the obliviousness that I had been so na\u00efve to in my pre-adolescent life. I looked around, and felt very suspicious of every person(read: white) I interacted with. Going back to my old neighborhood from time to time allowed me to take some of my newly learned whiteness with me and help me realize how ignorant I really had been. Yet I continued to do nothing. Nothing to further the voices I was familiar with in a new environment who had so very few. Nothing to bring to light to these people, those who are suffering just a few towns away. I believe this is called White Guilt. Hard to say though, I am white after all, and don\u2019t know all of the terms I would suspect I should know. Fast- forward 20 years, and I find myself living in New England. Rhode Island to be more specific. I am now a software engineer at a non-tech electronics distribution company, allotted with an ample amount of time on the internet. This is where I have had the privilege to find the articles on TheRoot. Being that I have never been so aware of how many people in this country are still such racist pieces of shit, TheRoot has provided me at least some solace that not everyone is like these ignorant, ass-backward, self-proclaiming colonizers who still cling to the idea that the Matflower and its ilk are the only semblance of reality that matters. Frankly, I am pretty sure 90% of these people I meet, outside of the city, have never had a real discussion with any person of color.One article in particular that truly got me thinking, and made me want to further make changes in my life regarding activism, and how to behave as a still not fully woke white dude, was Mr. Harriot\u2019s article from 8-14-17 after the events in Charlottesville titled, \u201cFor Black People Who Have to Deal With White People This Week\u201d. Not only did this article provide me with insight on what NOT to talk about, it also showed me that, just because I am naively color blind, it doesn\u2019t mean it is my place and duty as such to speak of these things. It informed me to just shut my fucking mouth and let my interactions with people of color regarding such a \u201cyuge\u201d topic, talk to me if THEY feel like it and not because I feel in my whiteness that they should talk to me about it because of my empathetic wanting to appear, well, empathetic. This article pointed me in a direction to re-read most of the articles I had read on TheRoot with a newfound vigor to understand, and dismiss my aforementioned view of \u201creverse racist undertones\u201d. Also, it allowed me to understand why I feel the ways I do when I go to other news sites, and read the so-called news about current events that are reported by other non-woke writers who are reporting as only they know how to do at this moment. It showed me a way to prevent my \u201cwhite noseyness\u201d from being my purpose, and figure out WHY I was so enthralled and intrigued to get the information further from those directly affected, and less from those who act as if they are speaking for them. These things mentioned are what allowed me to see even further beyond the reported racial undertones of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d, and how it is not just another MCU comic book movie, and see the words I have always had in my heart and soul personified on screen with some of the most beautiful, well written, and brilliantly portrayed films I have seen in a very long time. I look forward to the day I can show this movie to my children to hopefully help them build a world that exists, as T\u2019Challa so eloquently described in the film, as a place where \u201cmore connects us than separates us\u201d. I feel this goes even one step further than Jordan Peele\u2019s \u201cGet Out\u201d, if only in its more universal presentation to a public that may or may not make the attempt to see \u201cGet Out\u201d. Which in itself is a tragedy as \u201cGet Out\u201d was amazing! All the way up to the end when every single person, who was paying attention, thought the cops pulling up at the end would inevitably result in the now completely demolished, Daniel Kaluuya, being arrested and not saved. Even writing this I get chills and shakes thinking about it and Black Panther. Both films had me in tears multiple times, and had me questioning what one Chad can do to make a difference without acting like another Susan who thinks they are beyond reproach only because they themselves are not \u201cracist\u201d. In conclusion Ms. Belton, I want to know what I can do to help. Beit joining my local black community in protest or purpose, or even using what I innately have as White Privilege to benefit the movement to end segregation and help others wake the fuck up! Thank you for this site, and hopefully for reading this as \u201cfrom a man who wants to further devote himself to change\u201d, and not just another Chad, Becky or Susan who doesn\u2019t realize I am speaking out of place. Sincerest Regards, Nick PS \u2013 to Mr. Young, I do not take offense, nor condemn anything I have read that you or anyone on TheRoot have written. I just want to make that clear since it may not be as apparent in my letter as it is to Mr. Harriot. Thank you.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most of all, this, from Twitter:", "keywords": ["clapback", "clapbacks", "roots", "michael", "article", "racist", "dont", "mailbag", "know", "writing", "black", "white", "secondhand", "im", "feel"], "polarity": 0.030450332311646174, "subjectivity": 0.47322082925185116},

You act like every white man hates every black man. Let me tell you something, you don\u2019t understand how not all white people are racist, just like not all germs are harmful or bad for you. So do you want to give me a better explanation about how Obama improved race relations than me just sitting through an article about uninformed statements about white people waving confederate flags and whispering racist jokes? Joe\n\nLike you, I also believe that former President Barack Obama ruined race relations in America. I have a theory that I like to call the \u201cObama effect.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBetween my sophomore and junior years in college, I had a job at a paper factory. I was the only black guy in the department where these huge paper tubes were made. I didn\u2019t know shit about paper or pulp, but I have always been pretty swift when it comes to figuring shit out.\n\nThe white guys, who had been working in the plant for years, saw me as an interloper and privileged dude who had never worked a hard job in his life. They even nicknamed me \u201cWorm\u201d because I was so skinny that my knees buckled the first time I had to lift one of those tubes.\n\nBut after a while, they also noticed that whenever there was a problem, I could help solve it pretty quickly. Soon they made me a \u201crover\u201d\u2014someone who basically wandered around the floor and helped fix shit. Whenever anything went wrong, they would call for \u201cthe Worm.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept for one guy.\n\nOne guy couldn\u2019t stand to ask for help from me. I suspect it was because he was so racist that he couldn\u2019t accept the fact that a black guy could figure out a problem that he couldn\u2019t. He would ask anyone for help except me, but they would always tell him to \u201cask Worm.\u201d This motherfucker was so resistant that he started losing his production bonus rather than ask me for help. He would rather be broke.\n\nThat\u2019s the Obama effect.\n\nI believe that much of the hate Obama received had nothing to do with politics. It was because these people had never had a black guy telling them what to do, and despite the fact that he fixed the economy, killed America\u2019s greatest enemy and gave millions of Americans health care, they would rather fuck up themselves and the country than admit that he was a decent president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s how Obama ruined race relations. For white people like you, Joe, racism was this country\u2019s secret shame, like a man with a small penis. But Obama\u2019s simple existence pulled down America\u2019s pants and exposed its flaccid inferiority complex to the world.\n\nBut Joe, it\u2019s not your fault that you were born that way.

Your hatrid for whites exudes from every pore. It is quite entertaining to watch, but I feel embarassed for you mostly. You are clearly a sociopath with narcisstic tendencies that thinks the entire world evolves around the struggles of the American black person. Are you struggling Mike? Really? You don\u2019t know struggle Mike. But you like to throw around those old tired words such as inequality, oppressed and racist. Yawn. There are people in today\u2019s world and historically that truly experienced those things, but not you Mike. You don\u2019t know struggle Mike. The reason you will never attain any respect or credibility is because you only think that you exist. Your selfish and self centered behavior refuses to allow you to notice the hundreds of other races in the world besides your own Mike. But you cannot see it and probably do not care. So, don\u2019t ask yourself why I don\u2019t care it either. You remind me of the person that Booker T. Washington was describing when he said: \u201cThere is another class of coloured people who make a business of keeping the troubles, the wrongs, and the hardships of the Negro race before the public. Having learned that they are able to make a living out of their troubles, they have grown into the settled habit of advertising their wrongs \u2014 partly because they want sympathy and partly because it pays. Some of these people do not want the Negro to lose his grievances, because they do not want to lose their jobs.\u201d This is you Mike. You make a living off of preaching hate and fueling the fire of division. Without it, you would be forced to find a new source of income, therefore, you choose to maximize the opportunity. Without this you offer nothing to the world. Is that what scares you Mike? All the skills you posses is being a race baiter? Come on man. You are better than that right? Get over yourself Mike. You will never win until you get out of the hole you have decided to live in. There are more races than just black and white Mike. You may want to pull your head out of your rear and notice how the hispanic race is blowing by you ever so quietly with wrecklace abandon, while you whine and complain. Best, Jorge\n\nWhen Jorge received no reply, he sent another message:\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nFrom: Jorge\n\nSubject: Hi Mike\n\n\n\nSILENCE...exactly.\n\nAnd this Twitter DM came from Brent:\n\nFrom: Brent Hello, I read one of your stories today and loved the way you over exaggerated it to make the readers feel your hatred. Yes some white people are definitely messed up and horribly racist but the only way the world will change for the better is to stop trying to create sides. I\u2019ve seen messed up stories made up by both sides. Don\u2019t be that guy. Your better then that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Jorge and Brent:\n\nI would like to fill you in on how I came to hate the whites:\n\nIt has been mentioned a few times in the comments sections that I was homeschooled until the age of 11. I was raised by a mother who was a combination of flower power hippie and Black Panther (not the T\u2019Challa one; the other kind). I lived in a black neighborhood. I had black friends. Although she taught me a lot about black people through osmosis and the huge collection of books in our home (I read The Autobiography of Malcolm X at age 7, and after reading the science fiction novel Soul of the Robot, I figured that Eldridge Cleaver\u2019s Soul on Ice couldn\u2019t be much different), she never really talked about white people at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I finally went to public school, I was supposed to be placed in the fifth grade but was skipped to the seventh. For the rest of my academic career, I was surrounded by white kids.\n\nAlthough white supremacy is inescapable in America, unlike most people, I had never spent any significant time around the whites. I was a black person who had never held any reverence, fear or respect for white people. Even after joining them in a scholastic setting, from high school through college, I never really met any white people who were especially smart or gifted. Being raised in a Caucasian-free bubble allowed me to view white people objectively, even more so than an immigrant would.\n\nBecause of this, I had many white friends, many of whom I am still close to. In fact, I\u2019d probably say I have more white friends than the average black person. Some of them are probably reading this right now. Almost all of them will tell you that I sometimes speak about race, politics and our differences without a filter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI say all of that to say this:\n\nWhen you read some of the things that I write, I know that my commentary often comes off as angry or belligerent, and I even understand why it seems that way:\n\nWhite people aren\u2019t used to anyone talking to them that way.\n\nMost people fashion conversations about anything in such a manner that they will be effective at changing the person\u2019s mind and get him or her to understand their viewpoint. As such, most conversations about race are tailored to appease white sensibilities. In a land built and sustained by white supremacy, the default setting is to discuss race in a way that caters to the sensibilities of the majority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFortunately\u2014or, in your case, unfortunately\u2014my upbringing was not entrenched in that way of thinking. I do not hate white people. I am simply unencumbered by the need to sidestep their sensibilities to make my point. White people are not my enemy. White people are not my friends. White people are not special to me. They are just people.\n\nSo when I write in this unapologetic, unfiltered way, it often offends the whites because they are not accustomed to being spoken to in such a manner. Because most of them are used to people\u2014especially minorities\u2014tiptoeing around their sensitivities to make a point, they interpret truth as anger.\n\nThat is white privilege.\n\nYes, I write about race. It\u2019s my job. Aside from that, I don\u2019t really think about white people that much. Sorry to burst your bubble, but I am not obsessed with race, any more than a carpenter is obsessed with wood. If you\u2019d like to believe that I walk around with a chip on my shoulder looking for ways to be offended by racism, I apologize.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJorge, I enjoyed your quote from Booker T. Washington. For most of his career, he was at odds with W.E.B. Du Bois on how they viewed America\u2019s race problem. Du Bois said of Washington, regarding the passage that you previously quoted:\n\nHis doctrine has tended to make the whites, North and South, shift the burden of the Negro problem to the Negro\u2019s shoulders and stand aside as critical and rather pessimistic spectators; when in fact the burden belongs to the nation, and the hands of none of us are clean if we bend not our energies to righting these great wrongs.\n\nIn all of your diatribe, you neglected to point out that racism does exist. If, by chance, it disappeared from the face of the earth, I would be happy to lose my job. I would even be delighted if racism withered away to a microscopic speck of bigotry undetectable to the human eye.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat hypothetical, tiny little bit of bigotry is also the size of the fuck I give about what you think of me.\n\nI get it from my mama.\n\nBe well.\n\nAnd finally, as promised, a bit of positive mail to end this week\u2019s mailbag:", "keywords": ["clapback", "blame", "roots", "obama", "racist", "dont", "mailbag", "mama", "mike", "know", "world", "race", "black", "white", "way"], "polarity": 0.04071927915148254, "subjectivity": 0.4846882464679076},

Christ for a half-eaten bag of Cool Ranch Doritos, in a failed attempt to make a joke, I suggested that I was leaving The Root:\n\n\n\nIt was a joke, but the responses were both overwhelming and clapback-worthy. Some people took it seriously.\n\nOthers took the opportunity to dance on my nonexistent grave and let me know what wypipo think about me.\n\nFrom: Justin T.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Bye, nigger Good riddance! We are tired of reading your low crying about \u201cwhypipo\u201d every day. Maybe they are tired of you entitled worthless low IQ violent sexually aggressive fucking apes and we refuse to take the blame for your terrible culture and behavior anymore. Fuck you nigger\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut at least it provided me with an opening for this week\u2019s mailbag. Let us begin.\n\nOur first two pieces of correspondence come from the comments section on the article about Mansa Musa I:\n\nWhen Wakanda Was Real The reason people love superheroes is that, when done correctly, they are the perfect combination\u2026 Read more Read\n\nFrom: Rev Hillarious stuff. Reads like a joke from The Onion. All written on white man\u2019s technology, while you\u2019re safe under the roof designed by white men, built by white men, and you crawl back to your sad little existence, carrying that sad little excuse for a paycheck, signed by a white man. You want to experience all of the wonders and technology of a culture who\u2019s biggest contribution to the world was using their own as cattle? Knock yourself out, boy. I hear Liberia is LOVELY this time of year. What better place to enjoy the hard work and innovation of black people?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this one, from Midland:\n\n\u201cMansa Musa, for centuries the Mali kingdom made Western Europe look like a collection of shithole countries.\u201d As long as you are incapable of seeing great civilisations except by how they compare to Europe, you are still caught in the eurocentric trap. Also as you are not European, that is not self deprecation on your part, but weirdly aggressive xenophobia. If a European boastfully remarked at how much of a shithole xy or z non-European country was compared to a contemporary European country, you would rightfully note that person to be an idiot, so why do you ruin a very informative article by boorishly doing the same? \u201cInstead of conquering through war, he expanded his empire through annexation\u201d Because the violent conquering had already taken place and annexation is not a peaceful act anyway. Why do you feel the need to sanitise a powerful empire? Imperialism is not universally bad in all situations, it has been the human way for millenia. \u201cWhile Europe was slowly emerging from the famine, war, disease and mass poverty that killed 1 in every 10 Europeans between 1315 and 1316, Musa was building universities, mosques and city centers throughout the empire of Mali.\u201d You sound almost gleeful. Western Europe also had universities, grand cathedrals and great market centres at this time. One of the reasons famine broke out was because countries like England had boomed since 1200 and by 1300 had a population estimated at between 5-6 million with more land cultivated than even in 1900. The Mali Empire\u2019s achievements at that time were clearly superior, but there is no need to denigrate other civilisations in a typically American fashion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlow clap.\n\nJust when I thought I\u2019d seen the complete spectrum of white fragility, you come up with an entirely new category. I can only applaud your brilliance at the creative ways you find to be butt-hurt. To find a way to be offended about 14th-century historical facts is trailblazing. I honor you, sirs.\n\nI love when anyone, including Rev, refers to anything as \u201cthe white man\u2019s\u201d because it is indicative of the overarching intercontinental Caucasian pillaging mindset that has weaved its way through history. You motherfuckers will colonize anything! This may be presumptuous of me, but I\u2019m willing to bet all the money in my white man\u2019s paycheck that\u2014aside from his method of associating himself with Steve Jobs\u2019 computers and Al Gore\u2019s internet\u2014Rev hasn\u2019t invented a damn thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut you know what I\u2019m gonna do, Rev? I\u2019m going to concede your point. If I am using the white man\u2019s technology and you are a white man, I\u2019m going to allow you to share credit for it. Using the transitive property, I\u2019m also going to give you shared credit for all white things. So Rev is responsible for Taylor Swift songs, the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the rape of Africa, the presidency of Donald Trump and the destruction of the entire planet.\n\nWhich leads me to Midland.\n\nMidland, if you feel that I disparaged European countries, I apologize. But as you can see, it\u2019s not my fault. I know you are probably somewhere wrapped in a blanket, quietly weeping at how I denigrated your ancestral home team, but now you see: I be using the white man\u2019s things sometimes. According to Rev, it\u2019s your fault. Why don\u2019t you people take responsibility for your actions?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for my part in this, I am willing to share in some of the blame. I recognize that since my people invented math, science, astronomy and agriculture before your people came over to Africa to study, steal and use it for atomic bomb-making, genocide and ravaging the earth, I am partially responsible for your salty, fuckboy tears of sorrow.\n\nI apologize.\n\nThe two recent articles on Boyce Watkins stirred up a lot of controversy about a lot of things. Two things, in particular, made their way to the mailbag. The first is from some of Watkins\u2019 adherents:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the past year, I have come to understand a valuable truth about myself and one of my greatest weaknesses. Some may even call it an obsession. It is this:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can\u2019t stand to see anyone take advantage of black people.\n\nIt makes me genuinely upset, and sometimes in my furor, I attack people. When I berate white people for their participation in white supremacy, some of the people who age like buttermilk left in the back seat of a Buick on a summer day (see ... there I go again) believe that it means I hate all white people. When I call out preachers who use the Bible as a means of spreading white people\u2019s messaging while stuffing their pockets with black people\u2019s hard-earned money, some Jesus worshippers view it as an attack on Christianity.\n\nAnd, yes, when I impugn the characters of people like Umar Johnson and Boyce Watkins for using the plight of black people to enrich themselves by duping people who have fallen prey to their cult of personality, as well as to trade in homophobia, misogyny and transphobia, some see it as an attack on black people, Pan-Africanism and cultural knowledge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am fine with that.\n\nI realize that some white people believe in whiteness like some Christians believe in their pastors, like some black people believe in anyone who feeds them a fetishized bullshit narrative. Those people have faith. I will never change their minds because they believe in the people, not the ideas.\n\nBut I won\u2019t stop trying.\n\nBecause\u2014even when they\u2019re black\u2014those people are using blackness as a way to target my people. Johnson and Watkins are no different from Creflo Dollar or the Democratic Party. They mean us no good. They just want power and money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the entire time I\u2019ve written for The Root, I have never had a white person tell me what I could and couldn\u2019t write. In fact, aside from the directive from my black editors that I couldn\u2019t call Ray Lewis a \u201ccoon\u201d that one time, I have never been told by anyone what I couldn\u2019t say at The Root. No, we are not black-owned. But we are operated and run by black people and use our platform for black people. But I\u2019m sure that when you\u2019re typing your comments on white-owned Facebook\u2019s platform, Mark Zuckerberg sends you a private message telling you what you can and can\u2019t say.\n\nSo while you think you are dissing me for calling out charlatans, con men and people who scream about white supremacy only because they want the opportunity to get rich and control women, gays and transgender people, I actually take it as a compliment.\n\nFuck those guys.\n\nAnd, finally, Boyce Watkins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore last week, I had never followed Boyce Watkins and was only marginally aware of him. It was members of the Black Business School who pointed out this story to The Root and gave us the specifics, which means that if he feels attacked, he should confront his own customers.\n\n\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think Watkins is upset with The Root. He is pretending to be upset because his stream of revenue has been threatened. Who else is he going to attack\u2014the white guy and Asian guy who called him a \u201ccharacter\u201d whom they use to sell \u201chope and emotion\u201d as a \u201creligion\u201d to black people? They\u2019re his business partners. They created and control the \u201ceducational product\u201d he sells. Except for the email where he called their comments \u201crude and culturally insensitive,\u201d he has not distanced himself from the guys who said publicly, \u201cWe don\u2019t have to educate them.\u201d He remains in bed with people who don\u2019t seem to give a fuck about black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, during this whole ordeal, I gave Watkins the benefit of the doubt, as did some of the members of his organization who spoke with us. We all believed that he was being duped, too. They figured that he probably had no idea that the medicine he was selling to black people was just a placebo. But now I think differently.\n\nDespite the fact that he has not disproven a single fact in the story and, in fact, confirmed them all, Watkins has defended himself by telling his people that he was not given the opportunity to speak on the record:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe truth is this:\n\n\n\nOn Friday, Feb. 2, four days before this story went live, I sent Watkins an email inviting him to speak on the record. I sent a media request to Watkins\u2019 personal page. I sent him a message on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, he has continued to publicly say that he was not contacted, despite the fact that we posted his company\u2019s entire email response to the article. When he made these public statements, the petty part of me posted screenshots of my attempts to contact him:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe repeatedly deleted them.\n\nWatkins might not be a con man. He might be serious about helping black people achieve financial freedom. Maybe he believes that working with men who don\u2019t care about black people is the only way he can achieve his goals. But there is one thing you can be sure of:\n\n\n\nBoyce Watkins is a liar.", "keywords": ["clapback", "roots", "fact", "using", "dont", "mailbag", "rev", "black", "mans", "watkins", "apology", "white", "way", "im"], "polarity": 0.02524870962370963, "subjectivity": 0.4430071086321085},

Monique Judge for the record, Black Men have consistently explained the Gay Agenda, and if you like we can have a discussion about it. You and the other coon, Michael Harriot at root.com need to fall back from attacking Confident heterosexual Black Men. Before you call me a Hotep, save it for the person that fit the description. I am a Humanistic Atheist, I don\u2019t give a damn about any form of religion or Spirituality or the dumb Woke shit. The Gay Agenda is just as real as your hate for confident heterosexual Black Men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear IsAllah Self-Kingdom,\n\nFirst, I\u2019d like to congratulate you. Since I\u2019ve been a full-time employee at The Root, we have been arguing about the Hotepest name ever, and you win hands down. While I\u2019m sure you are a fine, upstanding citizen, your name has obviously done a nine-year bid in prison, where it converted to Islam. I bet your name wears a kufi, refers to pork as \u201cswine\u201d and fucks heavyset white girls on the low. I bet your real name is something like Parker Willoughby.\n\nSetting aside the Hotepery that is your name, I want to offer my sincerest condolences, because I know your secret:\n\nYou have a tiny penis, don\u2019t you, IsAllah?\n\nDon\u2019t be ashamed. It happens. That\u2019s probably why you don\u2019t believe in God, and I don\u2019t blame you. What kind of god would allow his people to be tortured and oppressed for 400 years and then give one of his children a pinkie-toe-sized penis?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though I don\u2019t know you, I know men like you. I know men who boast about being \u201cconfident black men,\u201d but in real life, they suffer from the perpetual anger of erectile dysfunction because they can\u2019t get a spoonful of blood to flow into their thimblelike phallus. I recognized your inadequacy because your attitude resembles that of a very stupid white supremacist who claims to be \u201cthe least racist person\u201d we\u2019ll ever meet. He claims to be very smart and says he went to the best schools. I won\u2019t embarrass him by calling his name, except to say that he is a \u201cvery stable genius,\u201d just like you are a \u201cconfident, heterosexual black man\u201d who doesn\u2019t believe in God or religion but calls himself \u201cIsAllah.\u201d\n\nEarlier today, Monique Judge was giggling at guys who talk about the \u201cgay agenda.\u201d Trust me, I don\u2019t giggle. The white man makes us believe that giggling is masculine, but I overstand because I use my fourth eye. Not my third eye, because the number 3 is a relic of Christian slavery from the Holy Trinity, the three wise men and the three blind mice. (Also, my third eye is what I call my penis.)\n\nApparently, you and others live in constant fear that \u201chomosexuals\u201d have a secret plan that could convince you to eat swine and engage in same-sex shenanigans. Don\u2019t fall prey to the gay agenda. I can tell you are a weak-minded individual worried about the prospect that acknowledging the humanity of people whose love looks different from yours could magically render you semen-thirsty. Resist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStay strong, IsAllah.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA coon.\n\nThe next clapback stems from an article at HuffPost by Dwayne Wong (Omowale) entitled \u201cStop Using Hotep as an Insult.\u201d In it, Wong says:\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, hotep is an ancient Egyptian term that means \u201cto be at peace.\u201d This is why it\u2019s distressing to me when I see people trying to use hotep as an insult\u2014some of the writers at the Root are especially at fault for helping degrade the term hotep. These people either do not know what the term means or they know and are deliberately trying to demean African history and culture. The term has been coming up a lot lately in regards to Umar Johnson. Umar has been in the headlines because he is currently under investigation and faces losing his psychology license. Umar has also been caught up in a feud with Tariq Nasheed, the director of the Hidden Colors series. Damon Young gave this definition of hotep: Over the past decade or so, the working definition of \u201cHotep\u201d has morphed into an all-encompassing term describing a person who\u2019s either a clueless parody of Afrocentricity\u2014think \u201cPreach\u201d from Don\u2019t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood\u2014or someone who\u2019s loudly, conspicuously and obnoxiously pro-black but anti-progress. As African people we have been subjected to having our history and culture degraded, distorted, and destroyed for centuries now. The people who have bastardized what hotep means are contributing to that problem. Take Michael Harriot, for example. Harriot is a writer at the Root and he is constantly using his platform there to criticize Umar Johnson. Some of these criticisms have merit, but other times they have gone so far that Harriot himself has had to apologize and admit he was wrong. In his latest article on Umar, Harriot ironically mocks Umar as being a \u201cHotepologist\u201d and miseducator, even though Harriot is operating as a miseducator himself by distorting what the term hotep means. Another article mocks the fight between Umar and Tariq as being \u201cThe Real Husbands of Hotep\u201d. Hotep means to be at peace, so how does that term fit in with the discord that we have seen being displayed between Umar and Tariq. When Umar and Seti had their feud in 2016, another writer at the Root described it as a \u201cHotep Hoedown\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Dwayne,\n\nFirst of all, I want to say: You are right.\n\nEven before I read your article, I had been conflicted about using the word \u201cHotep\u201d as a pejorative. I fully recognize the origin and the meaning of the word. As someone who came to The Root partly because of my blog NegusWhoRead [Editor\u2019s note: And because of me. \u2014Yesha], I realize the importance of taking back words that have been used against us. There is only one problem that I have:\n\nWhat will we call Hoteps?\n\nNeither Damon Young, I nor any other writer at The Root created the term \u201cHotep\u201d to describe the overly woke people who engage in misinformation and thievery against the black community. We use the word because people know what it means. But I readily admit that I fell into the trap of lazily throwing it at those who honestly seek liberation by connecting themselves with their ancestral heritage. While I do think that the default deification of everything Egyptian is problematic for a number of reasons, I recognize that \u201cHotep\u201d is a desperate clinging to a history that has been stripped away from our people by a long legacy of white supremacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTherefore, I promise that I will no longer use it in a derogatory manner. I do not speak for any other writer here, but I\u2019m going to do better. This pledge does, however, lead back to my original problem: What will we call Hoteps? (OK, that was the last time.) I have come up with a list:\n\nWhore-teps\n\n\n\nUmaricans\n\nPoor Tariq-ans\n\nAnkhologist\n\nQuack Lies Matter\n\nWokeheads\n\nNeo Not-Sees\n\nHidden Coloreds\n\nBlacksliders\n\nIsAllah Self Kingdom\n\nHopefully one of those will suffice.\n\nFrom: Justin Other Nigga\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: The Root is anti-black Hey faggot, How much do they pay you to keep bashing black men like Umar? How many people do you mentor? What are you doing for the black community? have you done anything other tna tear black men down? Why do you have so much hate for men like Umar?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Justin,\n\nLet me tell you a story.\n\nI grew up poor as fuck. Not underprivileged\u2014poor. Nights-without-electricity poor. Days-without-water poor. Cereal-and-water-for-dinner poor. I lived in a very religious household and was homeschooled until I was 12.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy first year attending school, I was excited to experience many of the things most people take for granted. I remember how incredibly pumped I was for picture day at school. When that day came, each student was supposed to bring $10 to have his or her picture taken. The night before picture day, my mother informed my sisters and me that she only had $30\u2014not enough for pictures for my three sisters and me. As the only boy in the house, I told her to let my sisters take their pictures. I was heartbroken, but I was over it by the next morning.\n\nThen a miracle happened.\n\nI swear on everything that is good and true that I exited the house on the morning of picture day, and lying on the ground was a $10 bill! I could have taken that money and had my picture taken, but I knew that the reason I couldn\u2019t take pictures was that my mother had to be dead broke. She was in her last week of college and wasn\u2019t working, so I gave her the money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was a Friday. The next day at church (we attended church on Saturdays), I watched my mother put $10 in the offering plate. I still believe that my mother put that money in the offering because she thought she was \u201csowing a seed.\u201d That\u2019s how blind, desperate faith works.\n\nAfter service that night, everyone gathered around in the church parking lot to gaze at the pastor\u2019s shiny new car. (It was a shitty Chrysler New Yorker, but to me, it was a might as well have been a Maserati.)\n\nFuck Umar Johnson and all the thieving motherfuckers sucking the souls and money from anyone hoping to sow a seed for black people because we are desperate for something ... anything. I hope they die a fiery death in the depths of hell. I want my foot to be the one that kicks them over the edge. They are worse than white supremacists. I\u2019d rather have a cross on my lawn than a hand in my pocket.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root is not making me rich. When I heard about Johnson\u2019s hearing, I was going to go whether The Root sent me or not. I had planned on paying my own way the same as I had done when I went to Ferguson, Mo.; Baltimore; Jena, Texas; and Sanford, Fla. I didn\u2019t ask a black person for a dime to go to any of those places.\n\nYes, I am a hater. I hate con men. The $10 I found on my way to school did as much good for people as the $400,000 raised by Johnson. He has never produced a business plan, budget or shred of evidence that he is starting a school. If he can prove where the money he collected went, I will take back every word I\u2019ve ever said about him. I\u2019ve done it before. I am not happy he is defrauding people who want a school for black boys. I want one, too.\n\nAs long as I have fingers to type and a platform, I will never leave him alone. So call me a faggot. I could care less about what you\u2014wait ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\n...

Per usual, black women showed up and showed out at the ballot box, helping Doug Jones win Jeff Sessions\u2019 vacated Senate seat in what was supposed to be a safe victory for Republican candidate Roy Moore.\n\nAll against robust voter-suppression efforts.\n\nA Washington Post exit poll shows that 98 percent of black women voted for Jones, compared with the 63 percent of white women who voted for Moore, a man who faces accusations from several women claiming that he sexually assaulted them as teenagers. It is clear that black women are the moral force of America. Let\u2019s keep it 100. Black women knew the stakes were high. Had Moore won, he would have been one more pro-Donald Trump degenerate black people had to contend with.\n\nBlack women said, \u201cNah, we gon\u2019 come out and take care of this mess.\u201d\n\nThey have always been enthusiastic about voting, as evidenced by the fact that they have outvoted black men since 1984 (pdf). Social protests, namely the shooting deaths of black men by police officers, have already energized black women to hit the streets. That they would harness that same energy to ensure that a racist woman hater would not win a Senate seat should surprise no one.\n\n\u201cBlack women have been leading in grassroots organizing that\u2019s been happening across the South and the nation for several years, particularly since the Trayvon Martin case,\u201d said Bree Newsome, an activist who made international news for scaling a flag post to take down a Confederate flag in South Carolina in 2015. \u201cMany interpret the resistance as having begun in January of 2017, but what we are seeing now is the electoral result of long-term organizing efforts spearheaded by black women. We were actively resisting racism and sexism before Trump and the Alabama Senate race.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComparatively, white female voters in Alabama proved, yet again, that they cannot be trusted. Essentially, as they did in the 2016 presidential election, white women chose their race over their gender. Upholding white supremacy and patriarchy is still their priority. It is understandable why so many of us declared that \u201cblack women saved America.\u201d\n\nBut let\u2019s be real. White women in Alabama did not really want to be saved. They voted for an alleged child molester. In reality, black women care about themselves and their futures. Republicans in the U.S. Senate support a tax bill that purges the middle class and rally behind a president who attacks Obamacare, which black women rely on and white women need, but they\u2019re too blinded by their racism to realize it.\n\nMeanwhile, #BlackWomen is trending on Twitter, celebrating the organizing power of black female voters. Black women took time to remind readers of what the next steps should be:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking of some of the \u201cy\u2019all,\u201d I asked Leah Wright Rigueur, a professor at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, why so many white women backed Moore despite his alleged history of sexual assault:\n\nMany do so for complicated reasons, including the fact that they\u2019ve voted Republican their entire life and can\u2019t envision voting for a Democrat. Others do so for less complicated reasons: They support the Republican agenda and therefore will support whatever candidate holds the GOP banner aloft. And then, of course, you have people that will tie themselves in knots to try and rationalize their support of Moore, when, at the end of the day, it boils down to fact that they believe what Moore believes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoom.\n\nBlack women didn\u2019t do this just for Jones or America or the Democratic Party. It\u2019s not as if the relationship is reciprocal in the first place. Black women showed up last night because they are the most eager for progressive change, even though they have historically gotten little in return for it. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) is the only black woman in the U.S. Senate, and black women make up a mere 3.6 percent of Congress, according to Higher Heights. They make up just 3.7 percent of state legislators nationwide and 14.7 percent of all female state legislators in the country. There are only two black lieutenant governors in the union (both men), and no state has ever elected a black female governor. (Ahem, Democratic National Committee, there is a black woman named Stacey Abrams running for Georgia governor.)\n\nMoreover, black women make 63 cents (pdf) of the white man\u2019s dollar, despite being head of the household for more than 50 percent of families with children under 18. They suffer the highest mortality rates after childbirth, and 12 percent (pdf) are uninsured, twice the rate of white women. It\u2019s as if black women keep investing in the Democrats\u2019 stock but get almost no cashable return.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while praise for black women on Twitter this morning abounds, people should consider how to look at black female voters beyond being mules for the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between \u2018Black women should do the work\u2019 and \u2018We need to support black women who are doing work,\u2019\u201d said L. Joy Williams, chairwoman of Higher Heights. \u201cIt needs to come with resources and actual support, and not just tweets and retweets and a hashtag.\u201d\n\nThe days of simply thanking black women for saving the day and giving them nothing in return must end. Black women running for office at all levels need money. Lots of it. The DNC needs to appoint them to positions of power in Washington, D.C., and at the local and state levels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe next step is for, not only the DNC, [but] the DCCC [Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee], DSCC [Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee] and all of the Democratic operations ... to evaluate how much of their resources they are going to invest into black women and voters in general way before we get to the end of 2018,\u201d Williams added.\n\nThat is the best thank-you the party and America could offer them.", "keywords": ["support", "saved", "senate", "alabama", "moore", "voters", "women", "night", "voted", "black", "white", "female", "democratic"], "polarity": 0.0004219077568134182, "subjectivity": 0.35432315064390524},

Yet since their inception, HBCUs have been in a war for their very existence, whether facing Congress or state legislatures.\n\nHBCUs have even found themselves repeatedly at odds with President Barack Obama. As economist and author Julianne Malveaux, former president of Bennett College, said in an interview this summer with Roland Martin on the Obama administration, \u201cThere was insensitivity to HBCUs and a sense that we didn\u2019t \u2018deserve\u2019 [federal] money.\u201d\n\nStill, during this election cycle, presidential candidates have used HBCUs as backdrops to garner the vote of black people, but none have shown dedication\u2014present or past\u2014to ensuring their sustainability and longevity. This lack of dedication to HBCUs is reflected in the policy platforms of both major political parties as well as many alternative political parties, where HBCUs are mentioned as an afterthought or not mentioned at all.\n\nFor example, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign touted its plans to make the first two years of college free at public HBCUs, as well as give $25 billion to private HBCUs. Upon deeper analysis, her plan would actually be two free years of community college open to all American students, as well as $25 billion available to all 1,600 private colleges and universities in the country.\n\nThe Green Party, with its presidential nominee Jill Stein, merely states in a one-liner that it will support HBCUs, but it offers no substantive plan for how. And there\u2019s zero mention of HBCUs by the ultraconservative Republican Party and Libertarian Party, which could mean that they\u2019d prefer the eradication of these institutions, as they plan for so many government entities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo where is the national plan of action to grow and protect our HBCUs?\n\nIn the absence of a comprehensive platform to address the needs of the black community, in August a coalition of more than 60 black-led organizations, including the Black Lives Matter Network, known collectively as the Movement for Black Lives, or M4BL, released their own platform entitled, \u201cA Vision for Black Lives,\u201d which addresses numerous inequities disproportionately affecting black people, including higher education and HBCUs. The M4BL coalition writes:\n\n\n\nIn recent years we have taken to the streets, launched massive campaigns, and impacted elections, but our elected leaders have failed to address the legitimate demands of our Movement. We can no longer wait. \u2026 We recognize that not all of our collective needs and visions can be translated into policy, but we understand that policy change is one of many tactics necessary to move us towards the world we envision.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn its policy platform, which is arranged into six sections, the Movement for Black Lives demands the following:\n\n\n\nTuition- and fee-free public college\n\nStudent-loan-debt forgiveness\n\nThe preservation of HBCUs through reauthorization of the 1965 Higher Education Act, with increased and sustained funding for both public and private HBCUs\n\nA mandate for state governments to match federal funding for HBCUs\n\nThe publicly funded expansion of undergraduate and graduate degree and certification offerings at HBCUs\n\nPublic funding for HBCUs to attract and retain staff and faculty\n\nAn increase in federal and state funding to HBCUs for building maintenance and upgrades, operational budgets and research\n\n\u201cBan the box\u201d on college-admission and student-financial-aid applications\n\nThe expansion of the Second Chance Pell Grant to all individuals (juvenile and adult) currently incarcerated\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore than 30 HBCU presidents currently support the movement, and the platform has already been endorsed by myriad other organizations, including over 67 remaining members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, who are viewed as precursors to today\u2019s black millennial organizers and activists.\n\nIn a recent interview, Ash-Lee Henderson, an organizer for Project South and member of the M4BL policy table leadership team, said, \u201c[What] we know is that there\u2019s a need for transformative justice, for demands that actually aren\u2019t just Band-Aids on the big-issue problems that our communities are facing. And so, we wanted to put together a vision, a visionary platform, with transformative demands to not just reform the problem but to transform the way that black folks are able to live and thrive and support themselves in our communities.\u201d\n\nThe Movement for Black Lives has released a timely proposal with legislative and executive actions to ensure the survival and success of our remaining 100 HBCUs. And with presidential candidates, and a soon-to-be-named president, struggling to connect with black millennials, the M4BL policy team has also given them ideas to build from if they so choose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat remains to be seen is whether our elected and appointed officials will take note and have the gumption to be allies with black people and our illustrious institutions of higher education.\n\nJ.

Just think you are terrible for black people.\n\nAnd this:\n\nFrom: Tyler\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Black on Black Crime Michael, Please see my proven statistical response to your roots article on black on black crime. Also, you can see in my pic I am what you would call a black man 1. Data shows that 93 percent of black homicide victims are killed by other blacks. The left\u2019s rebuttal is that that 84 percent of white homicide victims are killed by other whites, but The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Jason Riley points outthat the white crime rate is \u201cmuch lower than the black rate.\u201d 2. FBI Statistics: \u201cBlacks commit violent crimes at 7 to 10 times the rate that whites do.\u201d Blacks committed 52 percent of homicides between 1980 and 2008, despite composing just 13 percent of the population. Across the same timeframe, whites committed 45 percent of homicides while composing 77% of the population, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Here are some more statistics from the FBI: In 2013, the FBI has black criminals carrying out 38 per cent of murders, compared to 31.1 per cent for whites. The offender\u2019s race was \u201cunknown\u201d in 29.1 per cent of cases. What about violent crime more generally? FBI arrest rates are one way into this. Over the last three years of data \u2013 2011 to 2013 \u2013 38.5 per cent of people arrested for murder, manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault were black. 3. Black crime is even more prevalent in the country\u2019s largest cities and counties. Heather Mac Donald writes in her book The War on Cops: How the New Attack on Law and Order Makes Everyone Less Safe that in Chicago, IL, blacks committed 76 percent of all homicides, despite composing 35 percent of the city\u2019s population. Blacks also accounted for 78 percent of all juvenile arrests. Whites, who compose 28 percent of the city\u2019s population, committed 4 percent of its homicides and 3.5 percent of its juvenile arrests. Hispanics, who compose 30 percent of the city\u2019s population, committed 19 percent of its homicides and 18 percent of its juvenile arrests. (Another eye-opening fact from Mac Donald\u2019s research is that only 26 percent of murder cases were solved in Chicago.) Blacks are 10 percent of the population in Los Angeles, CA, but commit 42 percent of its robberies and 34 percent of its felonies. Whites make up 29 percent of the city\u2019s population, and commit 5 percent of its robberies and 13 percent of its felonies. In New York City, blacks committed \u201c75 percent of all shootings, 70 percent of all robberies, and 66 percent of all violent crime,\u201d despite only composing 23 percent of the population, said Mac Donald in a Hillsdale speech. Additionally, 2009 Bureau of Justice Statistics numbers show that in 2009, \u201cblacks were charged with 62 percent of robberies, 57 percent of murders and 45 percent of assaults in the 75 biggest counties in the country, despite only comprising roughly 15 percent of the population in these counties.\u201d 4. There were almost 6,000 blacks killed by other blacks in 2015. By contrast, only 258 blacks were killed by police gunfire that year. 5. The percentage of blacks arrested for crimes is consistent with police reports. This is according to the National Crime Victimization Survey, as well as this 1985 study: \u201cEven allowing for the existence of discrimination in the criminal justice system, the higher rates of crime among black Americans cannot be denied,\u201d wrote James Q. Wilson and Richard Herrnstein in their classic 1985 study, \u201cCrime and Human Nature.\u201d \u201cEvery study of crime using official data shows blacks to be overrepresented among persons arrested, convicted, and imprisoned for street crimes.\u201d This was true decades before the authors put it to paper, and it remains the case decades later. \u201cThe overrepresentation of blacks among arrested persons persists throughout the criminal justice system,\u201d wrote Wilson and Herrnstein. \u201cThough prosecutors and judges may well make discriminatory judgments, such decisions do not account for more than a small fraction of the overrepresentation of blacks in prison.\u201d This data disproves the notion that racism is what drives higher rates of arrests among the blacks than among whites or broader America. 6. According to the FBI, \u201cBlack crime rates were lower in the 1940s and 1950s, when black poverty was higher\u201d and \u201cracial discrimination was rampant and legal.\u201d If it\u2019s not racism and poverty that are blame for the high black crime rate, then what is? ***7. According to Mac Donald, \u201cA straight line can be drawn between family breakdown and youth violence.\u201d Hence has nothing to do with white supremacy. As economist Thomas Sowell points out, before the 1960s \u201cmost black children were raised in two-parent families.\u201d In 2013, over 72 percent of blacks were born out of wedlock. In Cook County \u2013which Chicago belongs to \u2013 79 percent of blacks were born to single mothers in 2003, while only 15 percent of whites were born to single mothers. \u201cUntil that gap closes, the crime gap won\u2019t close, either,\u201d writes Mac Donald. When are we as a people from all different color pigment will stop labeling each other as a color which diminishes our self worth and start describing ourselves as Red Blooded Americans who are either male or female that\u2019s all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, Ricci and Tyler, I\u2019ll bite. I\u2019m going to accept all of your points before I dismantle them one by one:\n\nYou\u2019re not racist: If you\u2019re not racist, then you couldn\u2019t possibly believe that black people are somehow inherently or genetically more violent than whites. We know study after study shows that crime is a socioeconomic problem, so if blacks commit more violent crimes, could it possibly be that the black population is in a worse socioeconomic position than whites? You\u2019re not racist, remember, so it can\u2019t mean blacks are lazier, less willing to work or dumber, so what accounts for the disparity in income and education?\n\nBlack-on-black crime: Again, I accept your premise that blacks are responsible for black-on-black crime. But I must have missed your follow-up email that shows where black people don\u2019t care about that fact. I missed the part where you acknowledged that there are far more \u201cStop the violence\u201d marches and organizations dedicated to neighborhood violence than there are Black Lives Matter chapters. I probably turned a blind eye to your Twitter DM about anti-gang chapters. The message you sent about news organizations ignoring fraternal organizations, charities and nonprofits in black communities addressing these problems probably went into my spam folder. Strong black families are the cure: I agree with you on this one. In fact, I am working to put an end to all the black churches, black leaders and random influential Negroes who tell black people to keep fucking and stop caring for their kids. I\u2019ve never heard anyone say that, but conservatives and racists often bring it up as if black people don\u2019t care about these things, so it must be true. I\u2019m glad you agree with me on this one. Black people can\u2019t do two things at once: When black people talk about police-brutality and mass-incarceration rates, we ignore the impact that voting, community involvement and personal responsibility can have on our plight. Apparently, you two believe that black people focus on racism instead of concentrating on these other issues, and not in conjunction with them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRicci and Tyler, my point is this: You bring up these facts as if people who talk about racism aren\u2019t aware of them. As if we ignore them because we\u2019d rather blame everything on the white man. We don\u2019t. We know that part of the reason for the plight of black people in America is that we need to do better. We are trying to help each other do better. But when people like you two regurgitate the Fox News narrative that diminishes the role that white people, racism and the history of white supremacy in America play in black oppression, it is idiotic and tone-deaf.\n\nWhen you present this bullshit to black people as a counterargument to a discussion about police brutality or white supremacy, it means that you are either unaware that black people agree with these things, too, or it means that you are racist.\n\nAnd you can\u2019t be racist.\n\nI know this because Ricci said it, and Tyler proved it by sending me this picture of himself:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI did a Google Images search for this picture and found it all over the internet, including on the cover of a book. But I\u2019m sure Ty is a male model who just happens to dabble in statistical data that shows how dumb, violent and inferior black people are.\n\nHe\u2019s not a racist, though.\n\nEarlier this week, on the birthday of President Abraham Lincoln, staff writer Monique Judge took the opportunity to remind readers of the historical fact that the president called \u201cthe Great Emancipator\u201d did not free the slaves. Again, that is not her opinion; it is a fact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt did not go well.\n\nFrom: Andre Hickman The problem the problem with this article lies in the interpretation of The Human Condition. this false narrative that there are no white people who cared about black people during slavery or anytime before or after is completely dishonest and one sided.\n\nFrom Lincoln Gaffney: Monique, I sincerely do not know what you hope to accomplish with this piece. But assuming you care about equality among humans and this nation/world continuing on the path towards a \u2018more perfect union\u2019, I believe this kind of tone and content undercuts those aims that I care deeply about myself. To say Abraham Lincoln didn\u2019t care about black people is simply and factually false. The sad but unavoidable fact is that, in 1860, pretty much all politicians\u2014 even the more enlightened and radical among them like Lincoln, Chase, Seward\u2014 did not believe in overall equality of the \u2018races\u2019 Race is a myth that has been used to oppress and divide people over time; there is but one race, the human race; if you truly care about that idea becoming a reality, I would respectfully suggest not trying to make one of the most heroic and noble leaders ever in the US out to be a racist. Unlike the current Republican President, who actually is and is kinda proud of it. Lincoln was a radical in his time, and you are making him out to be the reactionary. It is unfair and I believe also hurtful to the propagation of equality. Peace, Lincoln Gaffney\n\nDearest Andre and Lincoln:\n\nI write to you from the darkest crevices of blackness, where neither light nor white tears dare approach. It is the two thousand and eighteenth year of our lord and saviors Desus & Mero, and you have taken time out of your busy schedule to inform a black woman that white people actually \u201ccared about black people during slavery.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs evidence, you point to ... umm ... well, nothing.\n\nLincoln was not against slavery. He was against the expansion of slavery. If he did not believe that blacks were subhuman pieces of property, or shouldn\u2019t be American citizens, he would not have offered to pay reparations to slaveholders and ship black people back to Africa.\n\nSince the beginning of the history of this great country, the overwhelming majority of white people in America have spent every day of their entire lives not shedding a bead of sweat to end slavery, Jim Crow or institutional racism. Lincoln, your \u201crespectful\u201d suggestion that Monique not \u201cmake one of the most heroic and noble leaders ever in the US out to be a racist\u201d simply means that you don\u2019t understand what racism is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImagine if you lived in a house with a group of bank robbers and shared the spoils of their robberies. You spent the money they stole and lived in the houses they bought with the cash. Not only that, but you knew about the bank robberies and said nothing, even when people asked you to help them stop the bank-robbing crew. You know what you\u2019d be called?\n\nNothing.\n\nYou\u2019re white.\n\nFinally, a comment regarding the following article:\n\nFrom: Dude at a Computer Honest question. At what point will the black population let go of the past? I\u2019m not asking for everyone to forget the past but stop using it as a crutch for societal and economic woes. I understand your points you made in the article but when will it actually end? I think it would help if we (everybody) were able to put a finger on it and say \u201cwhen we get here as a society, we can stop talking about the past (but never forget)\u201c? It does not have to end tomorrow, or next year or next decade. I\u2019m just wondering at what point can/should/will it stop?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Dude,\n\nUnlike the previous morons, you actually pose a salient question. While I cannot give an exact date, I can give you a list of markers that will indicate when black people will ultimately let go of the past and stop using it as a crutch:\n\nwhen black children are afforded the opportunity to attend schools in black neighborhoods that are funded as well as white schools;\n\nwhen the black unemployment rate is equal to the white unemployment rate;\n\nwhen black people with the same education and experience aren\u2019t paid less than their white counterparts;\n\nwhen police don\u2019t shoot black men disproportionately regardless of the crime rate;\n\nwhen employers stop throwing r\u00e9sum\u00e9s with black-sounding names in the garbage;\n\nwhen white women in parking lots don\u2019t clutch their purses when I walk by;\n\nwhen people like you stop coming to black websites to read about racism and end up butt-hurt;\n\nwhen white people stop telling black people how to react to their oppression;\n\nwhen the history of what white people have done to blacks for 500 years is no longer regarded by whites as inconsequential as they explain away white supremacy by using the Constitution, laws and the legacy of \u201cWestern civilization\u201d;\n\nwhen I, as a black man, can finally believe that my work, my children\u2019s existence and my entire life are totally and completely unaffected by the color of my skin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil then ...\n\nI\u2019ll see you next week.", "keywords": ["clapback", "population", "roots", "blacks", "stop", "racism", "racist", "whites", "lincoln", "mailbag", "facts", "crime", "black", "white"], "polarity": -0.005896180591062515, "subjectivity": 0.4246456834941086},

I\u2019m extremely disappointed that you feel the need to perpetuate the racial divide in this country. Admittedly, I\u2019m a white man. Not a white man of privilege, but a whit man nonetheless. I am a descendant of immigrants who came to this country with nothing and managed to build a lineage if success. It wasn\u2019t immediate and it wasn\u2019t easy. It took generations. I grew up on the east coast in some of the most diverse neighborhoods our nation had at the time. I shared classrooms and meals with people of color. As an adult, my home has always been open to people\u2019s of any origin, race, faith and sexual orientation. My son is gay. I admit that we all have our biases and some in this country have faced prejudices that I never will. That said, I have now read much of your work and can come to only one conclusion.. shame on you. Your work will do NOTHING to bring us together as a people. You clearly embrace the division because it gives you a platform. You are obviously an educated and articulate man. Unfortunately, you have chosen to use those abilities to perpetuate the division you claim to abhor. It is my hope that you see that your writings are not unifying or constructive. You have a platform to drive change.. instead you choose to perpetuate stereotypes.\n\nFrom: Michael G\n\nTo: Michael H.\n\nSubject Open Letter to White People Dear Michael, I find myself writing today in response to your article. I have to say that as a white man I cannot begin to understand the struggles that people of color are still going through. That being said, I wholeheartedly believe that within every individual is the ability to change their circumstances. If someone lives in the inner city and needs to get away, they can. If gangs are part of the equation, again, move. No one said this would be easy or cheap, but for the sake of children, what price? The people keeping the minorities down are the politicians and their rich friends who put just enough money into local schools so they don\u2019t close, and also they do things like dump $$ into Black Lives Matter. They want minorities to stay down. Stay angry. It\u2019s a cash cow for them. I truly wish we could all get along. Black Panther is just another cash cow for more elitist old white guys who conceptualized, bankrolled, cast, wrote, and on ad nauseum. I apologize for the rant, but I don\u2019t think that all whites are cut from the same cloth. But, being angry is usually the beginning of a fight. Thank you for your time. Michael\n\nBut of all the people who were angry, the people who believed the letter was addressed directly to them were the funniest:\n\nFrom: Tina To: Michael Don\u2019t lump. me in with white people.

I am a white woman who does anti-racism work with adults and children (on a multi-racial team). I thought because I did this type of work for a living I was anti-racist and doing my part. Your writing has made me realize that I have so much further to go on my journey to be anti-racist. I have been reading your column for a year now and it has made me a better person. I think of your writing and you when I make that quick decision-Should I say something? Should I show up for that? Now, I always do. Sometimes I fumble through my words and get nervous and don\u2019t always make the point I meant to-but with your words ringing in my ears I never stay silent. As a way of saying thanks, I made a donation to the #BlackPantherChallenge in your honor. I wish I could do more. With gratitude Susie\n\nAnd this:\n\nFrom: Nicholans\n\nTo: Daniele Belton\n\nSubject: Prolly Just another Chad ... But trying not to beHello Ms. Belton,I am writing you today because I have been finding myself on TheRoot.com more and more every day. While at first, I must admit that I felt as though there was a tone of reverse racism in the many articles I have read, especially from Damon Young, and Michael Harriot, I pushed through knowing that further information will conclude that I am simply another Chad who grew up color blind and not knowing I was sitting there oblivious to the atmosphere the black community as a whole is still feeling in this country. Growing up in Southern California through the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, racial tensions are nothing new to me, however, my naivety did have me thinking they had improved. Especially with the election of President Obama, and his rise to prominence being achieved not only through the black community striving to have their voices heard and their votes acknowledged, but also because of those of many other races and backgrounds getting woke by the increasingly obvious racism that has come into further light in recent years due to social media and the internet. Growing up in a predominantly black neighborhood, and a very different cultural environment, when I moved to a new place that was predominantly white, I was finally faced with white privilege, and the obliviousness that I had been so na\u00efve to in my pre-adolescent life. I looked around, and felt very suspicious of every person(read: white) I interacted with. Going back to my old neighborhood from time to time allowed me to take some of my newly learned whiteness with me and help me realize how ignorant I really had been. Yet I continued to do nothing. Nothing to further the voices I was familiar with in a new environment who had so very few. Nothing to bring to light to these people, those who are suffering just a few towns away. I believe this is called White Guilt. Hard to say though, I am white after all, and don\u2019t know all of the terms I would suspect I should know. Fast- forward 20 years, and I find myself living in New England. Rhode Island to be more specific. I am now a software engineer at a non-tech electronics distribution company, allotted with an ample amount of time on the internet. This is where I have had the privilege to find the articles on TheRoot. Being that I have never been so aware of how many people in this country are still such racist pieces of shit, TheRoot has provided me at least some solace that not everyone is like these ignorant, ass-backward, self-proclaiming colonizers who still cling to the idea that the Matflower and its ilk are the only semblance of reality that matters. Frankly, I am pretty sure 90% of these people I meet, outside of the city, have never had a real discussion with any person of color.One article in particular that truly got me thinking, and made me want to further make changes in my life regarding activism, and how to behave as a still not fully woke white dude, was Mr. Harriot\u2019s article from 8-14-17 after the events in Charlottesville titled, \u201cFor Black People Who Have to Deal With White People This Week\u201d. Not only did this article provide me with insight on what NOT to talk about, it also showed me that, just because I am naively color blind, it doesn\u2019t mean it is my place and duty as such to speak of these things. It informed me to just shut my fucking mouth and let my interactions with people of color regarding such a \u201cyuge\u201d topic, talk to me if THEY feel like it and not because I feel in my whiteness that they should talk to me about it because of my empathetic wanting to appear, well, empathetic. This article pointed me in a direction to re-read most of the articles I had read on TheRoot with a newfound vigor to understand, and dismiss my aforementioned view of \u201creverse racist undertones\u201d. Also, it allowed me to understand why I feel the ways I do when I go to other news sites, and read the so-called news about current events that are reported by other non-woke writers who are reporting as only they know how to do at this moment. It showed me a way to prevent my \u201cwhite noseyness\u201d from being my purpose, and figure out WHY I was so enthralled and intrigued to get the information further from those directly affected, and less from those who act as if they are speaking for them. These things mentioned are what allowed me to see even further beyond the reported racial undertones of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d, and how it is not just another MCU comic book movie, and see the words I have always had in my heart and soul personified on screen with some of the most beautiful, well written, and brilliantly portrayed films I have seen in a very long time. I look forward to the day I can show this movie to my children to hopefully help them build a world that exists, as T\u2019Challa so eloquently described in the film, as a place where \u201cmore connects us than separates us\u201d. I feel this goes even one step further than Jordan Peele\u2019s \u201cGet Out\u201d, if only in its more universal presentation to a public that may or may not make the attempt to see \u201cGet Out\u201d. Which in itself is a tragedy as \u201cGet Out\u201d was amazing! All the way up to the end when every single person, who was paying attention, thought the cops pulling up at the end would inevitably result in the now completely demolished, Daniel Kaluuya, being arrested and not saved. Even writing this I get chills and shakes thinking about it and Black Panther. Both films had me in tears multiple times, and had me questioning what one Chad can do to make a difference without acting like another Susan who thinks they are beyond reproach only because they themselves are not \u201cracist\u201d. In conclusion Ms. Belton, I want to know what I can do to help. Beit joining my local black community in protest or purpose, or even using what I innately have as White Privilege to benefit the movement to end segregation and help others wake the fuck up! Thank you for this site, and hopefully for reading this as \u201cfrom a man who wants to further devote himself to change\u201d, and not just another Chad, Becky or Susan who doesn\u2019t realize I am speaking out of place. Sincerest Regards, Nick PS \u2013 to Mr. Young, I do not take offense, nor condemn anything I have read that you or anyone on TheRoot have written. I just want to make that clear since it may not be as apparent in my letter as it is to Mr. Harriot. Thank you.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most of all, this, from Twitter:", "keywords": ["clapback", "clapbacks", "roots", "michael", "article", "racist", "dont", "mailbag", "know", "writing", "black", "white", "secondhand", "im", "feel"], "polarity": 0.030450332311646174, "subjectivity": 0.47322082925185116},

It also gave us an outlet that wasn\u2019t limited to, \u201cCan you believe what this motherfucker just wrote me?\u201d But now that we\u2019ve been doing this for a few months, I\u2019ve realized something:\n\nRacists aren\u2019t very original.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t mean to upset the hardworking racist community out there by disparaging their work ethic. I would, in no way, demean you by besmirching the sheer volume of work put in every day by the people whose hearts are filled with what I imagine to be terrible things like black jellybeans, the crotches of Donald Trump\u2019s post-golf tighty-whities and the rag used to clean Harvey Weinstein\u2019s house plant.\n\nThe problem is that along with being not very smart, racism gets boring after a while. It\u2019s not that I am no longer offended\u2014I never really get mad at people calling me \u201cnigger\u201d anonymously; it\u2019s just that I\u2019m no longer entertained. Maybe I have become numb to racism, and every form of it has now become banal. Maybe I\u2019m just jaded like an EMT who can scrape brains off the concrete after a car wreck while eating a peanut butter and Jelly sandwich.\n\nIn any case, I\u2019m calling for all you racists out there to inject some thought, originality or at least some common sense into your correspondence. If not, we run the risk of excluding you from the mailbag totally, and no one wants that. The only other solution is, maybe you guys will stop being racist and ...\n\nNah, that\u2019ll never work.\n\nOur first correspondence concerns an article about an Air Force sergeant who went on a racist rant.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Gary\n\nTo: Anne Branigin\n\nSubject: Feedback. ..airforce sergeant under investigation for racist rant How in the hell is this racist? All she said was \u201cblack\u201d...last I checked, saying \u201cblack females \u201c is not a racial slur. Talking about getting over sensitive and over reacting. So unless you\u2019re kissing black people ass, you\u2019re a racist. Thats bullshit. I\u2019ve also ran into quite a few black people with attitude in my life,as have I ran into alot of white people with attitude. ..no difference. ..attitude is attitude. Race dont mean shit when it comes to attitude. But since shes not black...then shes a racist?? Pfft. Ok,then...good luck with that. How about Mr. Chi from SNL... he called Trump a \u201ccracker\u201d tell me, why in the hell is that NOT racist? Cracker IS a racial slur when referring to whites. How about all the blacks that call each other \u201cnigger\u201d...if black people say it, its NOT racist, but anyone else... they\u2019re racist. Fuckin double standard in this country is getting WAAAAAY out of hand. They can\u2019t have it both ways. Is it racist...or \u201ca term of endearment\u201d as Kanye West once said? Make up your minds. Either way...for a black person to call a white person \u201ccracker\u201d or \u201cwonderbread\u201d or any of the other slurs they use, thats racist and makes them fucking Hypocrites too. If we all truely want to end racism, we need to stop getting our pants in a bunch over every little thing that has the slightest possibility of being racist, as well as holding EVERYONE, regardless of race, to the SAME standards. Just an opinion Thank you for your time\n\nHey, Gary:\n\nThere\u2019s a thing you need to know about racism: I don\u2019t say this to be combative. I genuinely hope that you will share it with your friends at the rallies and cross burnings:\n\nNo one gives a fuck what your white ass thinks about racism.\n\nStop thinking you get to decide or have a voice in anything about the subject. White people thinking they get to define racism is the same thing as a person who is accused of sexual assault climbing on the witness stand and presenting this legal defense:\n\n\u201cBut it was just date rape, right? I mean ... she\u2019s given consent to other men, so why should she be so mad at what I did? I don\u2019t see anything wrong with it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, Gary, I know you\u2019re dumb, so I\u2019m going to explain to you how white supremacy works:\n\nThe woman in this particular article is an officer in the armed forces\u2014an organization that has a strict hierarchy. She also holds an innate prejudice against black women, as do many others. In her world, her feelings are so uncontroversial and widespread that she was comfortable enough to share them on the internet.\n\nI presume that the airwoman, as a member of the Air Force, will be promoted multiple times. She will undoubtedly have women of color under her command. Those women\u2019s careers and lives will depend on a woman who not only doesn\u2019t give a fuck about them but also lives in a world that confirms her prejudices. Those black women under her command won\u2019t have the same opportunities as a white man or a white woman under the same command\u2014even if the black women are as smart, talented and hardworking as their white counterparts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr maybe she won\u2019t have a long career in the military. Maybe she\u2019ll get out and do one of the jobs most popular with military vets, like becoming a teacher or working in human resources or\u2014better yet\u2014law enforcement. I\u2019m sure her racism won\u2019t matter in those places.\n\nThat\u2019s how white supremacy works.\n\nHere\u2019s another way that it works: A man with the IQ of a three-toed sloth could watch that racist rant and say to himself: \u201cHow in the hell is this racist? In fact, I think I\u2019m going to fire off a sternly worded email about this! And while I\u2019m at it ... why can\u2019t I say nigger?\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis one is a direct message from Twitter user Free Radical:\n\nHello Mike! I figure I\u2019ll get right to the point: I\u2019m a sheltered white person (Spokane is white as fuck and I\u2019m an isolated nerd) who has a question, but I\u2019m worried it might be racist to ask. For starters, I know that black people are not a monolith, and I can easily see how the very notion of \u2018asking black people\u2019 could be racist. Still, the question lingers in my head. It\u2019s probably not an original question, but Google has failed me a bit in finding a comprehensive discussion of the subject. I love The Root. I love that it challenges a lot of my notions, and I\u2019m very much a fan of your work, and you\u2019re the first person I thought of that might be able to point me in a direction in which I could educate myself. My question/issue is this: I\u2019ve been listening to \u2018To Pimp a Butterfly\u2019 a lot lately, and the more I listen to it, the more I\u2019m moved by it and the more I fall in love with it. I like to post songs and lyrics on my Facebook page and share them with my friends, and I want to share this album and these songs with my friends. My question pertains to using \u2018the n-word\u2019 when quoting black artists. On one hand, I don\u2019t want to infringe on black ownership of the word. On the other, I don\u2019t want to censor the artist\u2019s work when I\u2019m sharing it. I don\u2019t want to be one of these assholes who goes \u2018hey, if they use it, I can use it,\u2019 so I\u2019m at a bit of an internal impasse. Anyway, do you know of any big articles or videos discussing this specific subject (i.e. quoting lyrics)? Either way, thank you for your time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHey, Free:\n\nFirst, I want you to know that I honestly appreciate your question. I say this with no sarcasm intended. I think your heart is in the right place and I hope you will continue to read and learn from The Root. Here is your answer:\n\nYou can\u2019t.\n\nIntentional or not, your quandary is the ultimate embodiment of white privilege. You are not actively seeking to oppress or demean anyone. In fact, it seems as if you want to do the opposite. But the notion that you are even searching for the answer to this indicates that you mean no harm, but also illustrates how you get to live in a world where you get to raise this question.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not accusing you of being a racist, and you seem to want an honest opinion. As a white person in America, you might not be as familiar with this concept as I and many other people of color are, but there is something you need to know:\n\nThere are some things you cannot do, simply because of the color of your skin. Most white people never learn this. Almost every black person has learned this lesson.\n\nYou. Cannot. Use. The. Word. Nigger.\n\nFull stop.\n\nI know, I know. It doesn\u2019t seem fair. But you must think of it this way:\n\nAt worst, you will have to suffer through the horrible possibility that you may have to wade through life under the oppression of never being able to post a Kendrick Lamar lyric on your Facebook page, with the only upside being that you have not inadvertently dredged up the history of lynching, slavery and white supremacy for the simple purpose of showing your internet friends how you totally relate to your favorite rapper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, on the plus side, you get to keep all your teeth!\n\nFrom: God Bless All Men & Women\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Prayers from white boy I pray that Jesus enters your heart and breaks the stone off of it that He loves all races as should we all. Saying all whites are this or all blacks are this is the same damn thing dont stoop to that level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear God:\n\nIs that too informal? Should I call you Mr. or Ms. Women? Imma just stick with \u201cGod\u201d because I\u2019d like to think we\u2019re friends, being that you so lovingly reached out to me and you\u2019re praying for me and everything. After all, you love me. Shouldn\u2019t friends be on a first-name basis?\n\nWhen I refer to you as God, I hope it doesn\u2019t come off as blasphemous, as I do not mean to insinuate that I am talking to the God. I mean, even if I believed in her, I wouldn\u2019t think she\u2019d be stupid and illiterate. I\u2019d know that the true and living God wouldn\u2019t just make shit up because she was feeling so injured by the words that one of the lowly creatures that she created wrote on the internet. I\u2019d know that any God who even insinuated such a thing was a false God.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know what I\u2019d tell that God? I\u2019d say: \u201cStop making shit up, you lying-ass motherfucker!\u201d I\u2019d tell that bullshit God who you just made up in an email to criticize me and make yourself feel good to show me where I said \u201call.\u201d \u201cShow me!\u201d I\u2019d say.\n\nYou know what that stone-heart-breaking Jesus God of yours would do? She\u2019d admit she was wrong and apologize. And then your made-up God and I would keep talking, and I\u2019d ask why, if she loves \u201call races\u201d so much like the email writer says, then why is the floor of the Atlantic Ocean littered with skeletons of black people thrown from slave ships? Why are we always the ones mopping up blood in Audubon Ballrooms or picking up bits of brain and bone on Memphis, Tenn., motel balconies? Were they not praying loud enough when Dylann Roof plopped down on that Charleston, S.C., church pew?\n\nI appreciate your thoughts and prayers, and I do not want to slander or attack any religion ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut your God obviously hates me, and I ain\u2019t letting that motherfucker nowhere near my heart.", "keywords": ["clapback", "roots", "racist", "need", "jesus", "dont", "mailbag", "game", "know", "id", "thing", "racists", "god", "person", "black", "white", "im", "step"], "polarity": 0.017008326732902996, "subjectivity": 0.48562764291577837},

Your claims have been overlooked for too long. They make movies about make-believe stuff like Santa Claus, Bigfoot and Caucasians who can dance, but never took the time to address your fairy tale of reverse racism. Hell, they even made a TV show about the Great Pumpkin and a movie about a sexy rabbit, but nothing about racist writers! How could this be?\n\nWell, today we are going to address the systematic inequality directed at white people. Because black people don\u2019t control Congress, the Senate, every state legislature, the U.S. economy and the media like white people do, dedicating this\u2014our weekly look back at the emails, direct messages and tweets we receive\u2014to the topic is the best we can do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t say we didn\u2019t try.\n\nThis first tweet and email go hand in hand:\n\n\n\nFrom: J.M. and Tucker.\n\nTo: Danielle Belton\n\nSubject: Racism is evil, regardless of the source Ms. Belton, Instead of blaming \u201cwhite people (not a race by the way)\u201d for all the problems in the black community, why don\u2019t you offer some tough love to your fellow blacks? How about stay in school, don\u2019t have sex and get pregnant outside of marriage and obey the law. Or, take responsibility for your own actions, respect authority and work hard. I\u2019m sure there are black parents who are out there who are responsible and raise children who are responsible and positive contributors to society. However, there are a large percentage who do not. My parents and sisters came here from Italy with little more than the clothes on their backs. No one handed them a \u201cwhite privilege card\u201d. They worked hard, saved money and did the best they could for my family. My advice to black people is stop being blinded by a desire for vengeance against \u201cwhite people\u201d and work hard to be prosperous. As they say, \u201cliving well is the best revenge\u201d\n\nDear Bill, J.M. and Tucker:\n\nAs one of Ms. Belton\u2019s \u201cfellow blacks,\u201d I can attest to the fact that she comes to every one of the Global Organizations Dedicated to the Descendants of Africans, Moor and Negroes (GODDAMN) monthly meetings and tells the young kids to stay in school, use condoms and obey the law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe younger \u201cfellow blacks\u201d just won\u2019t listen. You know how they are. Either they are too stupid to know what Danielle is telling them (you know they have lower IQs), or it might have something to do with the fact that unwed motherhood, the dropout rate and crime are all socioeconomic phenomena, and\u2014stripped of race\u2014poor whites have the same crime rate, teenage pregnancy rate and dropout rate. Danielle probably thinks the question should be, \u201cWhy is the black poverty rate so much higher?\u201d But you\u2019re right, J.M. It\u2019s probably because she doesn\u2019t scold her \u201cfellow blacks\u201d enough.\n\nCongratulations on the success of your cousins who moved here from Italy. I\u2019m sure it was difficult for them to succeed, given the fact that Giuseppe Crow Laws were just wiped off the books 50 years ago and the people in power now were the same people in power when this country was still lynching Italians for looking white people in the eye and they could only attend historically Italian colleges, universities and public schools. I\u2019m sure your cousins simply forgot the 250 years when black people couldn\u2019t\u2014as Tucker said\u2014go to the polls when we wanted higher wages, dignified jobs and \u201cleadership that promised to put [all] Americans first, above any foreign nation or domestic interest group.\u201d I guess black people didn\u2019t need that solution to their problems.\n\nHowever, you were right when you said, \u201cLiving well is the best revenge.\u201d That is true. I just wish people like you didn\u2019t build such a high barrier to \u201cliving well\u201d and then act as if we could eliminate the obstacle by telling our kids to \u201cjust climb higher\u201d and pretend like the wall was not there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think you should consider this: Saying \u201cFuck the people who built and maintain this wall\u201d and making fun of the wall builders isn\u2019t racist. It\u2019s just a tiny, microscopic form of \u201cliving well.\u201d\n\nThanks, J.M.\n\nA Twitter direct message from xxneverdasamexx:\n\nI just read your piece about Tucker and when they asked you on his show on fox news. You want to stand on your soap box, make fun of and judge white people because they\u2019re racists? And you think it makes all the racist and bigoted stuff you write about whites ok? And your comment about the quote \u201cthrow a rock into a pack of dogs...\u201d I think that actually applies to you...Tucker called you out and the Root for being racists against whites, now your own logic and using the dog quote, amounts to that of it doesn\u2019t apply, the person will let it fly...but you didnt let it fly, you started yelling like the hit dog. You and the Root are obviously racists against whites. Now, let\u2019s take some of what you wrote about white people and said about white people...you don\u2019t think it makes you racist or that you are racist. But let\u2019s say I wrote everything you wrote, the exact same way, same words..exactly the same..but instead of white, I used black...you would label me a racist white supremacist nazi KKK pos...and you want to talk about how whites shoot up schools and wherever else you said whites do...how about I\u2019m tired of all the dumb blacks who sell heroin and crack all over my city.. how about I\u2019m tired of the dumb blacks who run around in groups, in my city, jumping and beating white people who are alone for no other reason then their white...and you\u2019re the worst type, becuase you\u2019re such a hypocrite that wants to cry and yell that whites are racist, when you spew nothing but racism. The person who see race and racism is everything, is the REAL racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Sir:\n\nYou\u2019re right, The Root shouldn\u2019t make fun of white people. We had no idea you were this fragile, and apologize for all the white tears we caused.\n\nYou are correct that if white people wrote an article making fun of black people the way I and others at The Root make fun of white people, we\u2019d call them racist. But it wouldn\u2019t be because of what you wrote or said. We would object to what you said because it is offensive in combination with how you actually treat black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wanted to clap back at you by saying that unlike your frail, delicate, unseasoned, sallow spirits, black people wouldn\u2019t give a damn what you called us if you treated us equally. But I didn\u2019t want to speak on behalf of everyone at The Root, so I posed this question to the entire staff this morning:\n\nSuppose you were the leader of all the black people in America and you were approached by the leader of all white people [I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s Donald Trump or Taylor Swift] with this proposition: White people could magically erase all inequality, racism, hate, transphobia, homophobia, etc., in the world, but black people would have to agree to one thing: White people would get to address us only as \u201cniggers.\u201d ... Would you accept?\n\nSome immediately agreed to the proposition. Some wondered how we would enforce the agreement, while others didn\u2019t think it would ever work. There was a fierce debate going on until Editor-in-Chief Danielle Belton came in and broke up the conversation and made us get back to work. (And yes, J.M., as we dispersed, she yelled, \u201cMake sure you don\u2019t get pregnant or rob anyone today!\u201d See ... she\u2019s doing her part.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here is my point: Every single person considered it because we don\u2019t give a damn what you call us if you treat us equally! White people are more hurt about some motherfucking articles on a motherfucking website than they are about actual inequality! If that was the only racism black people had to face, we would rejoice.\n\nSo if you only wrote articles about the \u201cdumb blacks\u201d in your city selling heroin (I\u2019m sure it got there on all those black-owned boats and planes) or only wrote about the \u201cdumb blacks\u201d who go around attacking whites, but you eliminated every other form of discrimination and hate, we wouldn\u2019t call you a \u201cracist white supremacist nazi, KKK\u201d piece of shit ...\n\nJust a \u201cpiece of shit.\u201d\n\nFinally, a Twitter direct message:\n\nFrom: Mike Jones\n\nTo: Michael Harriot How does it feel to be one of the biggest racists in America?\n\nI\u2019d like to accept this award on behalf of all the black people who tried their hardest to win this title by simply talking about race. I\u2019d also like to thank some of the past winners, including the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Malcolm X and President Barack Obama, who were all called racists and accused of dividing the country by bringing up the subject of race.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most of all, I\u2019d like to thank my fellow nominees for this year.\n\nTo the white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va.: I know you thought you had it in the bag this year. But just because you brought together every different kind of racist to terrorize a city doesn\u2019t mean you deserve this award. I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cBut we actually killed someone, and Michael Harriot and the staff of The Root have never laid hands on another human being because of their race.\u201d Look, man, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. You just have to work harder next year. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll think of something.\n\nTo Donald Trump: I know you\u2019re over there talking to the panel trying to convince them that there must have been some illegal voting, but let it go. Can\u2019t you see it? We\u2019re more racist than you are. You tried to ban Muslims from entering the country, painted Mexicans as rapists and murderers, and put known white supremacists in your Cabinet. But did you create the term \u201cwypipo\u201d? Did you make jokes about potato salad? No, but we did. Let this be a lesson to you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut let me tell you what makes us the proudest.\n\nIn 1983 Timothy Coggins was seen dancing with a white woman at the People\u2019s Choice nightclub in Griffin, Ga. A few white men got together and kidnapped Coggins. Two of the kidnappers were law enforcement officers. Then they beat him. Then they wrapped a chain around his neck and dragged him for over a mile. But he was still alive.\n\nSo the white men took a knife and stabbed him. They sliced him. They slit him. They took turns. When one of them was too tired, the next man would take over. Then they tied him to a truck again, dragged him a little while longer, then threw him in a ditch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEveryone in town knew who did it because they bragged about the time they killed a nigger and got away with it. One of the killers said he \u201cmissed the good old days when you could kill a black man for no reason.\u201d Another one of them told his wife, \u201cIf you keep on, you\u2019re going to wind up like that nigger in the ditch.\u201d\n\nBut no one told on these men for 34 years. The ones who kept quiet were complicit in the Coggins family\u2019s unending grief. Silence is the most despicable kind of racism there is. I wonder who Coggins\u2019 loved ones hate more: the men who killed Coggins that night, or the ones who knew but didn\u2019t give a damn about their pain and suffering?\n\nBut today I stand before you to tell you that Mike Jones, Tucker Carlson and Fox News viewers everywhere have declared that I and the rest of The Root staff, by poking fun at the flimsy, snowflakelike, thin, pearl skin of America\u2019s ruling class, are more racist than Bill Moore Sr. and Frankie Gebhardt, who allegedly killed Timothy Coggins and left him dying in a ditch, and all the white people who kept the terrible secret for 34 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThank you.", "keywords": ["clapback", "roots", "blacks", "racism", "ok", "racist", "whites", "wrote", "mailbag", "sure", "butthurt", "root", "black", "white", "im"], "polarity": 0.03796901304713804, "subjectivity": 0.39948504764911},

Roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him!\u201d\n\nTweeting is one of the president\u2019s greatest strengths, and since most of his supporters sleep in their work trucks and have trouble reading big words, the president\u2019s version of events, or \u201calternative facts,\u201d plays well with this crowd.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: The president will come out strong in favor of something, anything. Then there is a vote and the president loses. The president then takes to Twitter to claim a different version of events, and his supporters who sleep in Confederate-flag sheets and masturbate to NASCAR believe it.\n\nTuesday was a historic night for America and a gut check for the nation. In short, black women saved America from having an accused pedophile, who reportedly preyed on teens when he was a district attorney in his 30s, from joining the Senate.\n\nAn early-morning tweet from the president seemed to provide evidence that someone else is manning his Twitter account after he passes out in front of the TV with KFC crumbs and Diet Coke dribble running down his chin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m convinced that one of his aides took the phone out of his underwear waistband to send out this tweet:\n\nTrump didn\u2019t write that tweet. Look at that hyphen between \u201cwrite\u201d and \u201cin.\u201d Also look at \u201cCongratulations\u201d as the first word. We know a lot of things about the president of Midland, Texas, and one of the things that we know, unequivocally, is that he\u2019s petty as shit. The president of Ugg-boot-loving white women would not tweet this. It\u2019s too much like right.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe other tweet, the one that notes that the deck was stacked against Moore, is way more like the president of tabacky stuffers. Also, what the hell does the president mean when he says that the deck was stacked against Moore? Does he mean the list of accusers who\u2019ve noted that Moore was consistently inappropriate as the district attorney? Look, the rest of the world is screwed, but for one night Alabama (specifically, the black women of Alabama), got it right.", "keywords": ["does", "roy", "stacked", "look", "cryingface", "president", "trump", "moore", "meme", "alabama", "deck", "permanent", "women", "twitter", "loss", "shit", "jordan"], "polarity": 0.15038990402362493, "subjectivity": 0.4971945367294204},

Christ for a half-eaten bag of Cool Ranch Doritos, in a failed attempt to make a joke, I suggested that I was leaving The Root:\n\n\n\nIt was a joke, but the responses were both overwhelming and clapback-worthy. Some people took it seriously.\n\nOthers took the opportunity to dance on my nonexistent grave and let me know what wypipo think about me.\n\nFrom: Justin T.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Bye, nigger Good riddance! We are tired of reading your low crying about \u201cwhypipo\u201d every day. Maybe they are tired of you entitled worthless low IQ violent sexually aggressive fucking apes and we refuse to take the blame for your terrible culture and behavior anymore. Fuck you nigger\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut at least it provided me with an opening for this week\u2019s mailbag. Let us begin.\n\nOur first two pieces of correspondence come from the comments section on the article about Mansa Musa I:\n\nWhen Wakanda Was Real The reason people love superheroes is that, when done correctly, they are the perfect combination\u2026 Read more Read\n\nFrom: Rev Hillarious stuff. Reads like a joke from The Onion. All written on white man\u2019s technology, while you\u2019re safe under the roof designed by white men, built by white men, and you crawl back to your sad little existence, carrying that sad little excuse for a paycheck, signed by a white man. You want to experience all of the wonders and technology of a culture who\u2019s biggest contribution to the world was using their own as cattle? Knock yourself out, boy. I hear Liberia is LOVELY this time of year. What better place to enjoy the hard work and innovation of black people?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this one, from Midland:\n\n\u201cMansa Musa, for centuries the Mali kingdom made Western Europe look like a collection of shithole countries.\u201d As long as you are incapable of seeing great civilisations except by how they compare to Europe, you are still caught in the eurocentric trap. Also as you are not European, that is not self deprecation on your part, but weirdly aggressive xenophobia. If a European boastfully remarked at how much of a shithole xy or z non-European country was compared to a contemporary European country, you would rightfully note that person to be an idiot, so why do you ruin a very informative article by boorishly doing the same? \u201cInstead of conquering through war, he expanded his empire through annexation\u201d Because the violent conquering had already taken place and annexation is not a peaceful act anyway. Why do you feel the need to sanitise a powerful empire? Imperialism is not universally bad in all situations, it has been the human way for millenia. \u201cWhile Europe was slowly emerging from the famine, war, disease and mass poverty that killed 1 in every 10 Europeans between 1315 and 1316, Musa was building universities, mosques and city centers throughout the empire of Mali.\u201d You sound almost gleeful. Western Europe also had universities, grand cathedrals and great market centres at this time. One of the reasons famine broke out was because countries like England had boomed since 1200 and by 1300 had a population estimated at between 5-6 million with more land cultivated than even in 1900. The Mali Empire\u2019s achievements at that time were clearly superior, but there is no need to denigrate other civilisations in a typically American fashion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlow clap.\n\nJust when I thought I\u2019d seen the complete spectrum of white fragility, you come up with an entirely new category. I can only applaud your brilliance at the creative ways you find to be butt-hurt. To find a way to be offended about 14th-century historical facts is trailblazing. I honor you, sirs.\n\nI love when anyone, including Rev, refers to anything as \u201cthe white man\u2019s\u201d because it is indicative of the overarching intercontinental Caucasian pillaging mindset that has weaved its way through history. You motherfuckers will colonize anything! This may be presumptuous of me, but I\u2019m willing to bet all the money in my white man\u2019s paycheck that\u2014aside from his method of associating himself with Steve Jobs\u2019 computers and Al Gore\u2019s internet\u2014Rev hasn\u2019t invented a damn thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut you know what I\u2019m gonna do, Rev? I\u2019m going to concede your point. If I am using the white man\u2019s technology and you are a white man, I\u2019m going to allow you to share credit for it. Using the transitive property, I\u2019m also going to give you shared credit for all white things. So Rev is responsible for Taylor Swift songs, the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the rape of Africa, the presidency of Donald Trump and the destruction of the entire planet.\n\nWhich leads me to Midland.\n\nMidland, if you feel that I disparaged European countries, I apologize. But as you can see, it\u2019s not my fault. I know you are probably somewhere wrapped in a blanket, quietly weeping at how I denigrated your ancestral home team, but now you see: I be using the white man\u2019s things sometimes. According to Rev, it\u2019s your fault. Why don\u2019t you people take responsibility for your actions?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for my part in this, I am willing to share in some of the blame. I recognize that since my people invented math, science, astronomy and agriculture before your people came over to Africa to study, steal and use it for atomic bomb-making, genocide and ravaging the earth, I am partially responsible for your salty, fuckboy tears of sorrow.\n\nI apologize.\n\nThe two recent articles on Boyce Watkins stirred up a lot of controversy about a lot of things. Two things, in particular, made their way to the mailbag. The first is from some of Watkins\u2019 adherents:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the past year, I have come to understand a valuable truth about myself and one of my greatest weaknesses. Some may even call it an obsession. It is this:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can\u2019t stand to see anyone take advantage of black people.\n\nIt makes me genuinely upset, and sometimes in my furor, I attack people. When I berate white people for their participation in white supremacy, some of the people who age like buttermilk left in the back seat of a Buick on a summer day (see ... there I go again) believe that it means I hate all white people. When I call out preachers who use the Bible as a means of spreading white people\u2019s messaging while stuffing their pockets with black people\u2019s hard-earned money, some Jesus worshippers view it as an attack on Christianity.\n\nAnd, yes, when I impugn the characters of people like Umar Johnson and Boyce Watkins for using the plight of black people to enrich themselves by duping people who have fallen prey to their cult of personality, as well as to trade in homophobia, misogyny and transphobia, some see it as an attack on black people, Pan-Africanism and cultural knowledge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am fine with that.\n\nI realize that some white people believe in whiteness like some Christians believe in their pastors, like some black people believe in anyone who feeds them a fetishized bullshit narrative. Those people have faith. I will never change their minds because they believe in the people, not the ideas.\n\nBut I won\u2019t stop trying.\n\nBecause\u2014even when they\u2019re black\u2014those people are using blackness as a way to target my people. Johnson and Watkins are no different from Creflo Dollar or the Democratic Party. They mean us no good. They just want power and money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the entire time I\u2019ve written for The Root, I have never had a white person tell me what I could and couldn\u2019t write. In fact, aside from the directive from my black editors that I couldn\u2019t call Ray Lewis a \u201ccoon\u201d that one time, I have never been told by anyone what I couldn\u2019t say at The Root. No, we are not black-owned. But we are operated and run by black people and use our platform for black people. But I\u2019m sure that when you\u2019re typing your comments on white-owned Facebook\u2019s platform, Mark Zuckerberg sends you a private message telling you what you can and can\u2019t say.\n\nSo while you think you are dissing me for calling out charlatans, con men and people who scream about white supremacy only because they want the opportunity to get rich and control women, gays and transgender people, I actually take it as a compliment.\n\nFuck those guys.\n\nAnd, finally, Boyce Watkins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore last week, I had never followed Boyce Watkins and was only marginally aware of him. It was members of the Black Business School who pointed out this story to The Root and gave us the specifics, which means that if he feels attacked, he should confront his own customers.\n\n\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think Watkins is upset with The Root. He is pretending to be upset because his stream of revenue has been threatened. Who else is he going to attack\u2014the white guy and Asian guy who called him a \u201ccharacter\u201d whom they use to sell \u201chope and emotion\u201d as a \u201creligion\u201d to black people? They\u2019re his business partners. They created and control the \u201ceducational product\u201d he sells. Except for the email where he called their comments \u201crude and culturally insensitive,\u201d he has not distanced himself from the guys who said publicly, \u201cWe don\u2019t have to educate them.\u201d He remains in bed with people who don\u2019t seem to give a fuck about black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, during this whole ordeal, I gave Watkins the benefit of the doubt, as did some of the members of his organization who spoke with us. We all believed that he was being duped, too. They figured that he probably had no idea that the medicine he was selling to black people was just a placebo. But now I think differently.\n\nDespite the fact that he has not disproven a single fact in the story and, in fact, confirmed them all, Watkins has defended himself by telling his people that he was not given the opportunity to speak on the record:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe truth is this:\n\n\n\nOn Friday, Feb. 2, four days before this story went live, I sent Watkins an email inviting him to speak on the record. I sent a media request to Watkins\u2019 personal page. I sent him a message on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, he has continued to publicly say that he was not contacted, despite the fact that we posted his company\u2019s entire email response to the article. When he made these public statements, the petty part of me posted screenshots of my attempts to contact him:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe repeatedly deleted them.\n\nWatkins might not be a con man. He might be serious about helping black people achieve financial freedom. Maybe he believes that working with men who don\u2019t care about black people is the only way he can achieve his goals. But there is one thing you can be sure of:\n\n\n\nBoyce Watkins is a liar.", "keywords": ["clapback", "roots", "fact", "using", "dont", "mailbag", "rev", "black", "mans", "watkins", "apology", "white", "way", "im"], "polarity": 0.02524870962370963, "subjectivity": 0.4430071086321085},

This week\u2019s roundup of emails, comments, tweets and direct messages comes from white people who aren\u2019t racist; they just want the writers at The Root to stick to facts.\n\nFor insight, we collected a few of the people who set aside their disdain for our obvious lack of intelligence so that they could educate us on the truth. We wanted to highlight these unseen contributors as a way of thanking them for their continued support. Without you, where would we be?\n\nLet\u2019s read some mail.\n\nOur first set of correspondence doesn\u2019t relate to any particular post. In fact, we could do a Clapback Mailbag every day if we wanted to post the messages we receive from white people who want to share data about how fucked up black people are. These are only two examples. Warning: The first one is extremely long, but we included it because it is most representative of many of the emails we get regarding this subject.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA direct message from Twitter user @RicciBicci:\n\nAfrican Americans accounted for 52.5% of all homicide offenders from 1980 to 2008. Black people make up 12.5% of the population. Let that sink in... But go on dodge, duck and use the whatever excuse you want. An no I\u2019m not a racist etc so don\u2019t even use that card. Just think you are terrible for black people.\n\nAnd this:\n\nFrom: Tyler\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Black on Black Crime Michael, Please see my proven statistical response to your roots article on black on black crime. Also, you can see in my pic I am what you would call a black man 1. Data shows that 93 percent of black homicide victims are killed by other blacks. The left\u2019s rebuttal is that that 84 percent of white homicide victims are killed by other whites, but The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Jason Riley points outthat the white crime rate is \u201cmuch lower than the black rate.\u201d 2. FBI Statistics: \u201cBlacks commit violent crimes at 7 to 10 times the rate that whites do.\u201d Blacks committed 52 percent of homicides between 1980 and 2008, despite composing just 13 percent of the population. Across the same timeframe, whites committed 45 percent of homicides while composing 77% of the population, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Here are some more statistics from the FBI: In 2013, the FBI has black criminals carrying out 38 per cent of murders, compared to 31.1 per cent for whites. The offender\u2019s race was \u201cunknown\u201d in 29.1 per cent of cases. What about violent crime more generally? FBI arrest rates are one way into this. Over the last three years of data \u2013 2011 to 2013 \u2013 38.5 per cent of people arrested for murder, manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault were black. 3. Black crime is even more prevalent in the country\u2019s largest cities and counties. Heather Mac Donald writes in her book The War on Cops: How the New Attack on Law and Order Makes Everyone Less Safe that in Chicago, IL, blacks committed 76 percent of all homicides, despite composing 35 percent of the city\u2019s population. Blacks also accounted for 78 percent of all juvenile arrests. Whites, who compose 28 percent of the city\u2019s population, committed 4 percent of its homicides and 3.5 percent of its juvenile arrests. Hispanics, who compose 30 percent of the city\u2019s population, committed 19 percent of its homicides and 18 percent of its juvenile arrests. (Another eye-opening fact from Mac Donald\u2019s research is that only 26 percent of murder cases were solved in Chicago.) Blacks are 10 percent of the population in Los Angeles, CA, but commit 42 percent of its robberies and 34 percent of its felonies. Whites make up 29 percent of the city\u2019s population, and commit 5 percent of its robberies and 13 percent of its felonies. In New York City, blacks committed \u201c75 percent of all shootings, 70 percent of all robberies, and 66 percent of all violent crime,\u201d despite only composing 23 percent of the population, said Mac Donald in a Hillsdale speech. Additionally, 2009 Bureau of Justice Statistics numbers show that in 2009, \u201cblacks were charged with 62 percent of robberies, 57 percent of murders and 45 percent of assaults in the 75 biggest counties in the country, despite only comprising roughly 15 percent of the population in these counties.\u201d 4. There were almost 6,000 blacks killed by other blacks in 2015. By contrast, only 258 blacks were killed by police gunfire that year. 5. The percentage of blacks arrested for crimes is consistent with police reports. This is according to the National Crime Victimization Survey, as well as this 1985 study: \u201cEven allowing for the existence of discrimination in the criminal justice system, the higher rates of crime among black Americans cannot be denied,\u201d wrote James Q. Wilson and Richard Herrnstein in their classic 1985 study, \u201cCrime and Human Nature.\u201d \u201cEvery study of crime using official data shows blacks to be overrepresented among persons arrested, convicted, and imprisoned for street crimes.\u201d This was true decades before the authors put it to paper, and it remains the case decades later. \u201cThe overrepresentation of blacks among arrested persons persists throughout the criminal justice system,\u201d wrote Wilson and Herrnstein. \u201cThough prosecutors and judges may well make discriminatory judgments, such decisions do not account for more than a small fraction of the overrepresentation of blacks in prison.\u201d This data disproves the notion that racism is what drives higher rates of arrests among the blacks than among whites or broader America. 6. According to the FBI, \u201cBlack crime rates were lower in the 1940s and 1950s, when black poverty was higher\u201d and \u201cracial discrimination was rampant and legal.\u201d If it\u2019s not racism and poverty that are blame for the high black crime rate, then what is? ***7. According to Mac Donald, \u201cA straight line can be drawn between family breakdown and youth violence.\u201d Hence has nothing to do with white supremacy. As economist Thomas Sowell points out, before the 1960s \u201cmost black children were raised in two-parent families.\u201d In 2013, over 72 percent of blacks were born out of wedlock. In Cook County \u2013which Chicago belongs to \u2013 79 percent of blacks were born to single mothers in 2003, while only 15 percent of whites were born to single mothers. \u201cUntil that gap closes, the crime gap won\u2019t close, either,\u201d writes Mac Donald. When are we as a people from all different color pigment will stop labeling each other as a color which diminishes our self worth and start describing ourselves as Red Blooded Americans who are either male or female that\u2019s all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, Ricci and Tyler, I\u2019ll bite. I\u2019m going to accept all of your points before I dismantle them one by one:\n\nYou\u2019re not racist: If you\u2019re not racist, then you couldn\u2019t possibly believe that black people are somehow inherently or genetically more violent than whites. We know study after study shows that crime is a socioeconomic problem, so if blacks commit more violent crimes, could it possibly be that the black population is in a worse socioeconomic position than whites? You\u2019re not racist, remember, so it can\u2019t mean blacks are lazier, less willing to work or dumber, so what accounts for the disparity in income and education?\n\nBlack-on-black crime: Again, I accept your premise that blacks are responsible for black-on-black crime. But I must have missed your follow-up email that shows where black people don\u2019t care about that fact. I missed the part where you acknowledged that there are far more \u201cStop the violence\u201d marches and organizations dedicated to neighborhood violence than there are Black Lives Matter chapters. I probably turned a blind eye to your Twitter DM about anti-gang chapters. The message you sent about news organizations ignoring fraternal organizations, charities and nonprofits in black communities addressing these problems probably went into my spam folder. Strong black families are the cure: I agree with you on this one. In fact, I am working to put an end to all the black churches, black leaders and random influential Negroes who tell black people to keep fucking and stop caring for their kids. I\u2019ve never heard anyone say that, but conservatives and racists often bring it up as if black people don\u2019t care about these things, so it must be true. I\u2019m glad you agree with me on this one. Black people can\u2019t do two things at once: When black people talk about police-brutality and mass-incarceration rates, we ignore the impact that voting, community involvement and personal responsibility can have on our plight. Apparently, you two believe that black people focus on racism instead of concentrating on these other issues, and not in conjunction with them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRicci and Tyler, my point is this: You bring up these facts as if people who talk about racism aren\u2019t aware of them. As if we ignore them because we\u2019d rather blame everything on the white man. We don\u2019t. We know that part of the reason for the plight of black people in America is that we need to do better. We are trying to help each other do better. But when people like you two regurgitate the Fox News narrative that diminishes the role that white people, racism and the history of white supremacy in America play in black oppression, it is idiotic and tone-deaf.\n\nWhen you present this bullshit to black people as a counterargument to a discussion about police brutality or white supremacy, it means that you are either unaware that black people agree with these things, too, or it means that you are racist.\n\nAnd you can\u2019t be racist.\n\nI know this because Ricci said it, and Tyler proved it by sending me this picture of himself:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI did a Google Images search for this picture and found it all over the internet, including on the cover of a book. But I\u2019m sure Ty is a male model who just happens to dabble in statistical data that shows how dumb, violent and inferior black people are.\n\nHe\u2019s not a racist, though.\n\nEarlier this week, on the birthday of President Abraham Lincoln, staff writer Monique Judge took the opportunity to remind readers of the historical fact that the president called \u201cthe Great Emancipator\u201d did not free the slaves. Again, that is not her opinion; it is a fact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt did not go well.\n\nFrom: Andre Hickman The problem the problem with this article lies in the interpretation of The Human Condition. this false narrative that there are no white people who cared about black people during slavery or anytime before or after is completely dishonest and one sided.\n\nFrom Lincoln Gaffney: Monique, I sincerely do not know what you hope to accomplish with this piece. But assuming you care about equality among humans and this nation/world continuing on the path towards a \u2018more perfect union\u2019, I believe this kind of tone and content undercuts those aims that I care deeply about myself. To say Abraham Lincoln didn\u2019t care about black people is simply and factually false. The sad but unavoidable fact is that, in 1860, pretty much all politicians\u2014 even the more enlightened and radical among them like Lincoln, Chase, Seward\u2014 did not believe in overall equality of the \u2018races\u2019 Race is a myth that has been used to oppress and divide people over time; there is but one race, the human race; if you truly care about that idea becoming a reality, I would respectfully suggest not trying to make one of the most heroic and noble leaders ever in the US out to be a racist. Unlike the current Republican President, who actually is and is kinda proud of it. Lincoln was a radical in his time, and you are making him out to be the reactionary. It is unfair and I believe also hurtful to the propagation of equality. Peace, Lincoln Gaffney\n\nDearest Andre and Lincoln:\n\nI write to you from the darkest crevices of blackness, where neither light nor white tears dare approach. It is the two thousand and eighteenth year of our lord and saviors Desus & Mero, and you have taken time out of your busy schedule to inform a black woman that white people actually \u201ccared about black people during slavery.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs evidence, you point to ... umm ... well, nothing.\n\nLincoln was not against slavery. He was against the expansion of slavery. If he did not believe that blacks were subhuman pieces of property, or shouldn\u2019t be American citizens, he would not have offered to pay reparations to slaveholders and ship black people back to Africa.\n\nSince the beginning of the history of this great country, the overwhelming majority of white people in America have spent every day of their entire lives not shedding a bead of sweat to end slavery, Jim Crow or institutional racism. Lincoln, your \u201crespectful\u201d suggestion that Monique not \u201cmake one of the most heroic and noble leaders ever in the US out to be a racist\u201d simply means that you don\u2019t understand what racism is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImagine if you lived in a house with a group of bank robbers and shared the spoils of their robberies. You spent the money they stole and lived in the houses they bought with the cash.

You know what you\u2019d be called?\n\nNothing.\n\nYou\u2019re white.\n\nFinally, a comment regarding the following article:\n\nFrom: Dude at a Computer Honest question. At what point will the black population let go of the past? I\u2019m not asking for everyone to forget the past but stop using it as a crutch for societal and economic woes. I understand your points you made in the article but when will it actually end? I think it would help if we (everybody) were able to put a finger on it and say \u201cwhen we get here as a society, we can stop talking about the past (but never forget)\u201c? It does not have to end tomorrow, or next year or next decade. I\u2019m just wondering at what point can/should/will it stop?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Dude,\n\nUnlike the previous morons, you actually pose a salient question. While I cannot give an exact date, I can give you a list of markers that will indicate when black people will ultimately let go of the past and stop using it as a crutch:\n\nwhen black children are afforded the opportunity to attend schools in black neighborhoods that are funded as well as white schools;\n\nwhen the black unemployment rate is equal to the white unemployment rate;\n\nwhen black people with the same education and experience aren\u2019t paid less than their white counterparts;\n\nwhen police don\u2019t shoot black men disproportionately regardless of the crime rate;\n\nwhen employers stop throwing r\u00e9sum\u00e9s with black-sounding names in the garbage;\n\nwhen white women in parking lots don\u2019t clutch their purses when I walk by;\n\nwhen people like you stop coming to black websites to read about racism and end up butt-hurt;\n\nwhen white people stop telling black people how to react to their oppression;\n\nwhen the history of what white people have done to blacks for 500 years is no longer regarded by whites as inconsequential as they explain away white supremacy by using the Constitution, laws and the legacy of \u201cWestern civilization\u201d;\n\nwhen I, as a black man, can finally believe that my work, my children\u2019s existence and my entire life are totally and completely unaffected by the color of my skin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil then ...\n\nI\u2019ll see you next week.", "keywords": ["clapback", "population", "roots", "blacks", "stop", "racism", "racist", "whites", "lincoln", "mailbag", "facts", "crime", "black", "white"], "polarity": -0.005896180591062515, "subjectivity": 0.4246456834941086},

I examine them for white tears, anger and racism and formulate a response in my head. Then I look at my computer and say:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do that shit in the morning.\u201d\n\nYes, I am a \u201clate motherfucker.\u201d\n\nI am one of the precious few people who have been endowed with the special gift of never being on time. I am always late. Late motherfuckers don\u2019t enjoy being late. Instead, we have a disability that prevents us from being on time, unlike some people who wake up at the crack of dawn and start working diligently. (I won\u2019t mention any names. Let\u2019s just say she might be a deputy managing editor at The Root.) I honestly think I should get disability and one of those parking decals so I can park up front and rush in.\n\nMy late-motherfucker-ness came in handy today because this was a slow week for hate mail. Then, at the last minute, it flooded in like white tears at a Black Lives Matter rally. I say all of this to ask a favor of the haters:\n\nCan you be a little more prompt?\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: For the record, I was up at 4 a.m. today and waited hours for this post ... because Negroes are always late. I thank my Irish side for never being a late Negro. \u2014Yesha]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs an example of how being a late motherfucker works, our first item is a comment from JC-Sean, who took umbrage with me calling Post Malone a \u201ccultural appropriator\u201d in a post from a few hours ago.\n\n\u201cCultural appropriation\u201d is the very definition of hypocrisy. Our society is a mixing pot of culture, meaning everyone from every background takes some aspects of another previous society and implements them to their needs. I needn\u2019t list off the dozens of things white culture has created that black culture has taken advantage of. If Post doesn\u2019t want to be known as a rapper and simply as a musician, who are you to question him? If society relies on pure feelings as it is, then what makes his claim unjustified in comparison?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear JC-Sean:\n\nI was all set to clap back at your white nonsense about cultural appropriation. It was going to be good, too. I was going to write how you, like many others who present this ignorant argument, have no idea what cultural appropriation actually means. I was going to explain to you like you are 5 years old how cultural appropriation has nothing to do with taking \u201caspects of another previous society\u201d and using them for one\u2019s needs.\n\nDamn, JC, I was going to roast your ass for being so dumb that you think using an art form, invention or technique created by another culture is \u201ccultural appropriation.\u201d My best line was going to be, \u201cNigga, I\u2019m not accusing every motherfucker who uses fire or a wheel of stealing from Cro-Magnon man!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen I was going to rip apart your kindergarten-slow-class-like logic by explaining that there is a difference between Eminem immersing himself in a culture, respecting it and contributing to the art form and Post Malone using the art form to make millions while simultaneously saying: \u201cDon\u2019t lump me in with those niggers. I\u2019m a musician, not a rapper.\u201d Then I was going to explain how he gets to dabble in the stereotype of hip-hop while enjoying the privilege of not having to deal with the consequences.\n\nMy only problem was, I needed an analogy to illustrate my argument. If only there were some incident that could show how Malone\u2019s whiteness means that he isn\u2019t treated like the black artists he emulates with his Caucasian step-and-fetch-it-ery. I desperately needed a way to prove that Malone gets to enjoy the societal privilege of being white and pocket the money from his pseudo-black stereotype. I must admit, JC, that I was stuck.\n\nAnd then this happened:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, that is Post Malone, on video in Las Vegas, the recent site of one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history, riding around with a machine gun mounted atop a truck.\n\nPost Malone is not in jail.\n\nPost Malone is still alive.\n\nShut the fuck up, JC.\n\nOur next clapback comes from an accident:\n\n\n\nYesterday, while searching for something on the internet, Producer Danielle Young discovered that there is a whole section of YouTube devoted to black conservatives clapping back at The Root.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are two of my favorites:\n\nAnd this dude, who calls himself \u201cUncle Hotep\u201d and spends a lot of time attacking black people in videos:\n\nI must be honest: I thoroughly enjoyed these niggas, in the same way people enjoy watching Bumfights and Jackass. I actually subscribed to their channels after watching a few of their videos because I sometimes need to remind myself what the opposite of \u201cself-aware\u201d is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext week, no one will be talking about the Erykah Badu article or that wig-wearing mop bucket who called April Ryan out of her name, and I can use these videos to help me become a better person. I\u2019m just going to scroll through them every now and then, and if I ever hear any of them say anything and think to myself, \u201cYou know, that guy makes a lot of sense,\u201d then I\u2019ll know what to do next:\n\nSlit my motherfucking throat.\n\nThe next clapback comes via an email written by a reader who disagreed with the article disparaging the Democratic Party.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: DJ\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Thanks You\u2019re a racist but you\u2019re right that democrats aren\u2019t friends of struggling communities. They love poverty. They keep people addicted to crumbs without teaching/promoting how to be independently successful and self reliant. They love when writers like you promulgate victim hood because it keeps people victims. When the black Fordham law professor wtites an article saying black people are disabled(link below), they cheer. If a person is disabled or a victim, they need help. So yeah, they\u2019ll keep giving those crumbs to the victims....in exchange for votes. They won\u2019t tell the victims they can succeed through hard work and making good decisions.(see Asian and black immigrants) Then they wouldn\u2019t need the Democrat\u2019s loving help. It\u2019s ethereal whiteness that\u2019s holding people back. Hmm, something that can\u2019t be quantified so can never be proven to be ended. That\u2019s the perfect boogeyman to keep people addicted to oppression. Maybe this is your wakeup call. I hope you\u2019re not as stupid as you are racist. Sincerely, Dj\n\nDearest Dj:\n\nFirst, I\u2019d like to thank you for recognizing both my stupidity and my racism and agreeing with me that the Democratic Party is trash. When I saw your link from the Fordham professor, I also agreed with you that it is a stupid idea to equate being black with being disabled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen I read the article from the link you sent from that bullshit right-wing site and the original article from Kimani Paul-Emile, who is an associate professor of law and director of Fordham University\u2019s Center on Race, Law, and Justice. After reading all of this, I sympathized with you because I quickly realized that one of my theories is correct:\n\nWhite people can\u2019t read.\n\nI realized this because Paul-Emile specifically wrote, \u201cBlackness, of course, is not, by itself, an impairment.\u201d Then I realized, after noting that the article explains that she is using the concept of disability law because \u201cit accurately reflects what Black, as a racial designation, is and was designed to be: disabling. Racial categories were created explicitly to serve as a caste system to privilege some and disadvantage others ... ,\u201d that you probably didn\u2019t read that part, because it is in the first sentence!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is what white people like you will do.\n\nYou plant the seeds of racism in every square inch of fertile soil, and when the poisonous flowers bloom, you wonder why we\u2019re sick. You accuse people of acting like victims because they\u2019re allergic to hate.\n\nI have seen the rape, oppression, torture, thievery and hate you spread around the world. You are a scourge of humanity, Dj. You are a monster. No one is afraid of \u201cboogeymen.\u201d But to quote Kevin Spacey from the great documentary The Usual Suspects:\n\n\u201cThe greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis second greatest?\n\nCreating Dj.", "keywords": ["clapback", "roots", "article", "appropriation", "mailbag", "going", "late", "art", "post", "culture", "black", "white", "cultural", "lastminute", "malone"], "polarity": 0.027621882086167802, "subjectivity": 0.4252031368102795},

As we close out 2017, we would like to thank our haters because we don\u2019t know where we\u2019d be without you. (Actually, we do know where we\u2019d be without you. We\u2019d be fractionally happier, I\u2019d probably have a better relationship with Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan, and the writers at The Root wouldn\u2019t have a faint sense of dread every time they open an email.)\n\nBut without you, none of this would have been possible. I\u2019d probably have to spend my Friday mornings doing something besides conjuring up the spirit of Ric Flair, so from all of us to all of you, we offer a sincere thumbs-up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe finger in the middle is the thumb, right?\n\nOur first selection pertains to a piece that serves as a yearly divining rod for white tears: the 2017 Wypipo Awards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst this comment from Iceseller:\n\nHey look everyone. The racist in chief of this racist blog wrote something racist again! How edgy. Fuck off you racist piece of shit. Maybe 2018 will see you fired and have to be racist somewhere else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis email from the cleverly named U. R. Gay:\n\nFrom U.R. Gay\n\nTo: Michael Harriot What If a white person wrote something the 2017 nigger awards you would call them a racist. You are a world-class racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this comment from Kodimah:\n\nImagine being so race obsessed you write a satiric column about another race thinking you aren\u2019t a gigantic racist yourself. Sad.\n\nDearest Iceseller, Mr. or Ms. Gay, and Kodimah:\n\nFirst of all, I would like to thank Iceseller for pre-emptively naming me to the position of \u201cracist in chief,\u201d but as a firm believer in democracy, I cannot, in good conscience, accept the title without a vote of some kind. While your admiration for me is appreciated, there are candidates far more qualified who could serve in this position.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTake the aforementioned Mr. Gay, for instance (I don\u2019t want to gender-profile anyone, but I\u2019m going to go ahead and assume that U.R. Gay is a guy). He seems like a perfect nominee for the position. He said that I am a \u201cworld-class racist,\u201d which means he has apparently traveled the world ranking them. I would think that he would be a better fit to serve as the king of all racists.\n\nBut I\u2019d like to push this conversation forward by pointing out something that seems obvious to me but has obviously flown over the heads of some of our readers. The Root is a publication that covers black America. Racism against black people is a problem in America. We write about it. We are no more obsessed with race than Deadspin is obsessed with sports, The Takeout is obsessed with food, Jalopnik is obsessed with cars or Jezebel is obsessed with the fact that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote. It is literally my job to talk about race.\n\nI think Kodimah put it best when he or she said: \u201cImagine being so race obsessed you write a satiric column about another race thinking you aren\u2019t a gigantic racist yourself. Sad.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet me explain what white privilege is:\n\nImagine living in a building with a sniper waiting outside. Imagine that, every day, the sniper shot someone who was exiting your building. Sometimes the sniper was in full sight, and other days the sniper was hidden, but he kept shooting at the people who lived in the building as they walked out.\n\nWhite privilege is the ability to say, \u201cYeah, but people in other buildings get shot, too.\u201d White privilege is the penchant for residents of safer buildings to ask why you don\u2019t just move out of the building. White privilege is being able to say, \u201cYeah, snipers exist, but you can\u2019t worry about them all the time.\u201d But most of all, white privilege is the oblivious idiocy of standing on the sidewalk and asking someone who could be killed by a sniper at any minute, \u201cWhy are you so obsessed with snipers?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow imagine reading a piece of satire written by a resident of the building, making fun of snipers. There is only one reason that I can surmise why anyone would be more angry at the person making jokes about snipers than they were at actual snipers:\n\nBecause they are a sniper, too.\n\nKodimah is right.\n\nIt is sad.\n\nFrom: Stephanie\n\nTo: The Root Staff The Root, I\u2019ve been a supporter for a long time. The fact that Skip Gates is a founder spoke to me about your integrity. Lately, I\u2019ve seen way too much cussing and specifically F bombs in your posts.\n\nIt\u2019s not cute. It\u2019s not funny. It\u2019s vulgar and common.\n\nIt\u2019s BENEATH you. As professional journalists and editors, if you must cuss to get your point across, you\u2019re in the wrong profession. Tired of it,\n\nStephanie\n\nStephanie, I get your point. I really do.\n\nMy mother is a wise woman and she, too, was a writer. When I was a kid, she forbade us from using vulgar language, including calling someone a \u201cdog,\u201d a \u201cliar\u201d or \u201cstupid.\u201d She only had two exceptions:\n\nif we were telling a story and the person in the story said the vulgar word or phrase if we could make a logical case why the word was necessary\n\nThose rules are basically the same rules to which we adhere at The Root. I know I have a foul mouth, and I am often asked by the editors and copy editors if a certain word is necessary. Sometimes they change those words without even asking me. I don\u2019t even have a problem with that because I know I can be hyperbolic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if you are a regular reader of The Root, then you know we use a million creative insults, euphemisms and allusions to replace dirty words. I reject the idea that there are \u201cbad words\u201d or that using vulgar language is a sign of a lack of intelligence, and here is why:\n\nSome people are motherfuckers.\n\nThere is a difference between not giving a darn and not giving a fuck. Knocking the crap out of a person is different from slapping the shit out of someone. Sometimes the words you consider to be boorish are the ones that perfectly describe a situation or thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRacism, homophobia, discrimination and Donald Trump are vulgar. Tamping down the description of those things by playing lexical dodgeball with the vocabulary to preserve the pearls that our readers may clutch is not our job.\n\nA few days ago I wrote a story about a Sacramento, Calif., policeman named John Tennis who had a habit of trying to hit black suspects with his car. He shot multiple black people and killed at least two. Even his fellow police officers said that he often discharged his weapon when it wasn\u2019t necessary. Raheem Hosseini of the Sacramento News and Review wrote a puff piece about him that made him into a sympathetic figure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could have called them both colostomy bags filled with racism and prejudice. I could have used flowery language to explain how Tennis exemplified the persistent deadly threat posed by men whose uniforms have become a license to cosplay as executioners. I probably could have blistered Hosseini as an entitled equivocator who uses black lives as a stepladder to get closer to the spotlight while using his pen to blot out the bloodstains of the slaughtered innocent. But no ...\n\nFuck those guys.\n\nWhenever we write about Umar Johnson, we get a lot of email from his followers. Here are three:\n\nA direct Twitter message from Kwesi X:\n\nDear sir, I am from overseas and would like to let you know how sick you make me. Why you\u2019ve spent all your time gunning for Dr umar I\u2019ll never know I just want u to answer, How many kids u council? How many people u visited in jail to do free speaking events? Even if u don\u2019t like umar if u really a journalist of credibility you would have presented a balanced article not a I hate umar hit story. You are a fake black owned company that is simply marketed to black people. But your not really helping are you? Just making money on the drama You should be ashamed of yourself\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd these tweets:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear sirs,\n\nFirst of all, no one who is originally from outside the country says that he is \u201cfrom overseas.\u201d I don\u2019t believe you. You need more Hotep people.\n\nI admit that I am conflicted about using the word \u201cHotep\u201d as a derogatory term because I know the history of the word, but I will also confess that when I was assigned the Umar story, I thought, \u201cHere come the Hoteppers.\u201d I am also tired of writing about Umar Johnson, but I think it is my responsibility. I don\u2019t hate Johnson\u2019s message of \u201cblack consciousness,\u201d any more than I hate the bullshit of prosperity gospel, except for one fact:\n\nHe steals from black people.\n\nLet me be clear:\n\nI believe that black people should know their history. I believe that our connection to our ancestors is important. I believe that there should be a school for black boys with an African-centered education. I desperately hope that someone builds one. I hope there comes a day when there is one in every city and black children can learn how the great Greek philosophers had to go to Africa to get their knowledge, and how the noble, ancient Europeans were bitch-slapped by the Moors and learned agriculture, irrigation, science and astronomy from dark people. One day someone will come with a plan to build and fund this dream.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen that day comes, there will be people who say, \u201cI would donate, but the last time I gave money to something like this, a charlatan who claimed to be a descendant of Frederick Douglass conned me out of my coins.\u201d They will remember how he answered his phone while it was ringing and puffed up his chest whenever anyone asked him to show his Ph.D. People will recall how he publicly preached about the black family while fucking exotic dancers on the low-low. Some will bring up the fact that the last guy who was going to build a school would never show the receipts for how he spent the money.\n\nUmar Johnson\u2019s antics actually make it harder to build this school. If anyone ever achieves the goal of making this a reality, it will be in spite of Umar Johnson, not because of him.\n\nAnd we are not anti-Umar. When everyone doubted Johnson\u2019s degree, it was The Root that spent money to verify his Ph.D. and end the speculation. I am the one who spent days combing through yearbooks and graduation programs hoping that he was legitimate. When I found the evidence, I admitted that I was wrong. In. The. Headline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am also the one who has refused to shade him even as I am constantly contacted by people in and outside the \u201cconscious movement\u201d who claim to have personal knowledge that always turns out to be spurious because they have a beef with Johnson.\n\nNo one here hates Umar Johnson.\n\nWe just like the truth.", "keywords": ["clapback", "awards", "roots", "racist", "umar", "old", "mailbag", "know", "dont", "word", "cusswords", "sniper", "obsessed", "root", "black", "white", "friend"], "polarity": -0.019970001889644755, "subjectivity": 0.5327755247398107},

I would, in no way, demean you by besmirching the sheer volume of work put in every day by the people whose hearts are filled with what I imagine to be terrible things like black jellybeans, the crotches of Donald Trump\u2019s post-golf tighty-whities and the rag used to clean Harvey Weinstein\u2019s house plant.\n\nThe problem is that along with being not very smart, racism gets boring after a while. It\u2019s not that I am no longer offended\u2014I never really get mad at people calling me \u201cnigger\u201d anonymously; it\u2019s just that I\u2019m no longer entertained. Maybe I have become numb to racism, and every form of it has now become banal. Maybe I\u2019m just jaded like an EMT who can scrape brains off the concrete after a car wreck while eating a peanut butter and Jelly sandwich.\n\nIn any case, I\u2019m calling for all you racists out there to inject some thought, originality or at least some common sense into your correspondence. If not, we run the risk of excluding you from the mailbag totally, and no one wants that. The only other solution is, maybe you guys will stop being racist and ...\n\nNah, that\u2019ll never work.\n\nOur first correspondence concerns an article about an Air Force sergeant who went on a racist rant.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Gary\n\nTo: Anne Branigin\n\nSubject: Feedback. ..airforce sergeant under investigation for racist rant How in the hell is this racist? All she said was \u201cblack\u201d...last I checked, saying \u201cblack females \u201c is not a racial slur. Talking about getting over sensitive and over reacting. So unless you\u2019re kissing black people ass, you\u2019re a racist. Thats bullshit. I\u2019ve also ran into quite a few black people with attitude in my life,as have I ran into alot of white people with attitude. ..no difference. ..attitude is attitude. Race dont mean shit when it comes to attitude. But since shes not black...then shes a racist?? Pfft. Ok,then...good luck with that. How about Mr. Chi from SNL... he called Trump a \u201ccracker\u201d tell me, why in the hell is that NOT racist? Cracker IS a racial slur when referring to whites. How about all the blacks that call each other \u201cnigger\u201d...if black people say it, its NOT racist, but anyone else... they\u2019re racist. Fuckin double standard in this country is getting WAAAAAY out of hand. They can\u2019t have it both ways. Is it racist...or \u201ca term of endearment\u201d as Kanye West once said? Make up your minds. Either way...for a black person to call a white person \u201ccracker\u201d or \u201cwonderbread\u201d or any of the other slurs they use, thats racist and makes them fucking Hypocrites too. If we all truely want to end racism, we need to stop getting our pants in a bunch over every little thing that has the slightest possibility of being racist, as well as holding EVERYONE, regardless of race, to the SAME standards. Just an opinion Thank you for your time\n\nHey, Gary:\n\nThere\u2019s a thing you need to know about racism: I don\u2019t say this to be combative. I genuinely hope that you will share it with your friends at the rallies and cross burnings:\n\nNo one gives a fuck what your white ass thinks about racism.\n\nStop thinking you get to decide or have a voice in anything about the subject. White people thinking they get to define racism is the same thing as a person who is accused of sexual assault climbing on the witness stand and presenting this legal defense:\n\n\u201cBut it was just date rape, right? I mean ... she\u2019s given consent to other men, so why should she be so mad at what I did? I don\u2019t see anything wrong with it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, Gary, I know you\u2019re dumb, so I\u2019m going to explain to you how white supremacy works:\n\nThe woman in this particular article is an officer in the armed forces\u2014an organization that has a strict hierarchy. She also holds an innate prejudice against black women, as do many others. In her world, her feelings are so uncontroversial and widespread that she was comfortable enough to share them on the internet.\n\nI presume that the airwoman, as a member of the Air Force, will be promoted multiple times. She will undoubtedly have women of color under her command. Those women\u2019s careers and lives will depend on a woman who not only doesn\u2019t give a fuck about them but also lives in a world that confirms her prejudices. Those black women under her command won\u2019t have the same opportunities as a white man or a white woman under the same command\u2014even if the black women are as smart, talented and hardworking as their white counterparts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr maybe she won\u2019t have a long career in the military. Maybe she\u2019ll get out and do one of the jobs most popular with military vets, like becoming a teacher or working in human resources or\u2014better yet\u2014law enforcement. I\u2019m sure her racism won\u2019t matter in those places.\n\nThat\u2019s how white supremacy works.\n\nHere\u2019s another way that it works: A man with the IQ of a three-toed sloth could watch that racist rant and say to himself: \u201cHow in the hell is this racist? In fact, I think I\u2019m going to fire off a sternly worded email about this! And while I\u2019m at it ... why can\u2019t I say nigger?\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis one is a direct message from Twitter user Free Radical:\n\nHello Mike! I figure I\u2019ll get right to the point: I\u2019m a sheltered white person (Spokane is white as fuck and I\u2019m an isolated nerd) who has a question, but I\u2019m worried it might be racist to ask. For starters, I know that black people are not a monolith, and I can easily see how the very notion of \u2018asking black people\u2019 could be racist. Still, the question lingers in my head. It\u2019s probably not an original question, but Google has failed me a bit in finding a comprehensive discussion of the subject. I love The Root. I love that it challenges a lot of my notions, and I\u2019m very much a fan of your work, and you\u2019re the first person I thought of that might be able to point me in a direction in which I could educate myself. My question/issue is this: I\u2019ve been listening to \u2018To Pimp a Butterfly\u2019 a lot lately, and the more I listen to it, the more I\u2019m moved by it and the more I fall in love with it. I like to post songs and lyrics on my Facebook page and share them with my friends, and I want to share this album and these songs with my friends. My question pertains to using \u2018the n-word\u2019 when quoting black artists. On one hand, I don\u2019t want to infringe on black ownership of the word. On the other, I don\u2019t want to censor the artist\u2019s work when I\u2019m sharing it. I don\u2019t want to be one of these assholes who goes \u2018hey, if they use it, I can use it,\u2019 so I\u2019m at a bit of an internal impasse. Anyway, do you know of any big articles or videos discussing this specific subject (i.e. quoting lyrics)? Either way, thank you for your time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHey, Free:\n\nFirst, I want you to know that I honestly appreciate your question. I say this with no sarcasm intended. I think your heart is in the right place and I hope you will continue to read and learn from The Root. Here is your answer:\n\nYou can\u2019t.\n\nIntentional or not, your quandary is the ultimate embodiment of white privilege. You are not actively seeking to oppress or demean anyone. In fact, it seems as if you want to do the opposite. But the notion that you are even searching for the answer to this indicates that you mean no harm, but also illustrates how you get to live in a world where you get to raise this question.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not accusing you of being a racist, and you seem to want an honest opinion. As a white person in America, you might not be as familiar with this concept as I and many other people of color are, but there is something you need to know:\n\nThere are some things you cannot do, simply because of the color of your skin. Most white people never learn this. Almost every black person has learned this lesson.\n\nYou. Cannot. Use. The. Word. Nigger.\n\nFull stop.\n\nI know, I know. It doesn\u2019t seem fair. But you must think of it this way:\n\nAt worst, you will have to suffer through the horrible possibility that you may have to wade through life under the oppression of never being able to post a Kendrick Lamar lyric on your Facebook page, with the only upside being that you have not inadvertently dredged up the history of lynching, slavery and white supremacy for the simple purpose of showing your internet friends how you totally relate to your favorite rapper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, on the plus side, you get to keep all your teeth!\n\nFrom: God Bless All Men & Women\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Prayers from white boy I pray that Jesus enters your heart and breaks the stone off of it that He loves all races as should we all. Saying all whites are this or all blacks are this is the same damn thing dont stoop to that level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear God:\n\nIs that too informal? Should I call you Mr. or Ms. Women? Imma just stick with \u201cGod\u201d because I\u2019d like to think we\u2019re friends, being that you so lovingly reached out to me and you\u2019re praying for me and everything. After all, you love me. Shouldn\u2019t friends be on a first-name basis?\n\nWhen I refer to you as God, I hope it doesn\u2019t come off as blasphemous, as I do not mean to insinuate that I am talking to the God. I mean, even if I believed in her, I wouldn\u2019t think she\u2019d be stupid and illiterate. I\u2019d know that the true and living God wouldn\u2019t just make shit up because she was feeling so injured by the words that one of the lowly creatures that she created wrote on the internet. I\u2019d know that any God who even insinuated such a thing was a false God.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know what I\u2019d tell that God? I\u2019d say: \u201cStop making shit up, you lying-ass motherfucker!\u201d I\u2019d tell that bullshit God who you just made up in an email to criticize me and make yourself feel good to show me where I said \u201call.\u201d \u201cShow me!\u201d I\u2019d say.\n\nYou know what that stone-heart-breaking Jesus God of yours would do? She\u2019d admit she was wrong and apologize. And then your made-up God and I would keep talking, and I\u2019d ask why, if she loves \u201call races\u201d so much like the email writer says, then why is the floor of the Atlantic Ocean littered with skeletons of black people thrown from slave ships? Why are we always the ones mopping up blood in Audubon Ballrooms or picking up bits of brain and bone on Memphis, Tenn., motel balconies? Were they not praying loud enough when Dylann Roof plopped down on that Charleston, S.C., church pew?\n\nI appreciate your thoughts and prayers, and I do not want to slander or attack any religion ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut your God obviously hates me, and I ain\u2019t letting that motherfucker nowhere near my heart.", "keywords": ["clapback", "roots", "racist", "need", "jesus", "dont", "mailbag", "game", "know", "id", "thing", "racists", "god", "person", "black", "white", "im", "step"], "polarity": 0.017008326732902996, "subjectivity": 0.48562764291577837},

Christ for a half-eaten bag of Cool Ranch Doritos, in a failed attempt to make a joke, I suggested that I was leaving The Root:\n\n\n\nIt was a joke, but the responses were both overwhelming and clapback-worthy. Some people took it seriously.\n\nOthers took the opportunity to dance on my nonexistent grave and let me know what wypipo think about me.\n\nFrom: Justin T.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Bye, nigger Good riddance! We are tired of reading your low crying about \u201cwhypipo\u201d every day. Maybe they are tired of you entitled worthless low IQ violent sexually aggressive fucking apes and we refuse to take the blame for your terrible culture and behavior anymore. Fuck you nigger\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut at least it provided me with an opening for this week\u2019s mailbag. Let us begin.\n\nOur first two pieces of correspondence come from the comments section on the article about Mansa Musa I:\n\nWhen Wakanda Was Real The reason people love superheroes is that, when done correctly, they are the perfect combination\u2026 Read more Read\n\nFrom: Rev Hillarious stuff. Reads like a joke from The Onion. All written on white man\u2019s technology, while you\u2019re safe under the roof designed by white men, built by white men, and you crawl back to your sad little existence, carrying that sad little excuse for a paycheck, signed by a white man. You want to experience all of the wonders and technology of a culture who\u2019s biggest contribution to the world was using their own as cattle? Knock yourself out, boy. I hear Liberia is LOVELY this time of year. What better place to enjoy the hard work and innovation of black people?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this one, from Midland:\n\n\u201cMansa Musa, for centuries the Mali kingdom made Western Europe look like a collection of shithole countries.\u201d As long as you are incapable of seeing great civilisations except by how they compare to Europe, you are still caught in the eurocentric trap. Also as you are not European, that is not self deprecation on your part, but weirdly aggressive xenophobia. If a European boastfully remarked at how much of a shithole xy or z non-European country was compared to a contemporary European country, you would rightfully note that person to be an idiot, so why do you ruin a very informative article by boorishly doing the same? \u201cInstead of conquering through war, he expanded his empire through annexation\u201d Because the violent conquering had already taken place and annexation is not a peaceful act anyway. Why do you feel the need to sanitise a powerful empire? Imperialism is not universally bad in all situations, it has been the human way for millenia. \u201cWhile Europe was slowly emerging from the famine, war, disease and mass poverty that killed 1 in every 10 Europeans between 1315 and 1316, Musa was building universities, mosques and city centers throughout the empire of Mali.\u201d You sound almost gleeful. Western Europe also had universities, grand cathedrals and great market centres at this time. One of the reasons famine broke out was because countries like England had boomed since 1200 and by 1300 had a population estimated at between 5-6 million with more land cultivated than even in 1900. The Mali Empire\u2019s achievements at that time were clearly superior, but there is no need to denigrate other civilisations in a typically American fashion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlow clap.\n\nJust when I thought I\u2019d seen the complete spectrum of white fragility, you come up with an entirely new category. I can only applaud your brilliance at the creative ways you find to be butt-hurt. To find a way to be offended about 14th-century historical facts is trailblazing. I honor you, sirs.\n\nI love when anyone, including Rev, refers to anything as \u201cthe white man\u2019s\u201d because it is indicative of the overarching intercontinental Caucasian pillaging mindset that has weaved its way through history. You motherfuckers will colonize anything! This may be presumptuous of me, but I\u2019m willing to bet all the money in my white man\u2019s paycheck that\u2014aside from his method of associating himself with Steve Jobs\u2019 computers and Al Gore\u2019s internet\u2014Rev hasn\u2019t invented a damn thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut you know what I\u2019m gonna do, Rev? I\u2019m going to concede your point. If I am using the white man\u2019s technology and you are a white man, I\u2019m going to allow you to share credit for it. Using the transitive property, I\u2019m also going to give you shared credit for all white things. So Rev is responsible for Taylor Swift songs, the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the rape of Africa, the presidency of Donald Trump and the destruction of the entire planet.\n\nWhich leads me to Midland.\n\nMidland, if you feel that I disparaged European countries, I apologize. But as you can see, it\u2019s not my fault. I know you are probably somewhere wrapped in a blanket, quietly weeping at how I denigrated your ancestral home team, but now you see: I be using the white man\u2019s things sometimes. According to Rev, it\u2019s your fault. Why don\u2019t you people take responsibility for your actions?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for my part in this, I am willing to share in some of the blame. I recognize that since my people invented math, science, astronomy and agriculture before your people came over to Africa to study, steal and use it for atomic bomb-making, genocide and ravaging the earth, I am partially responsible for your salty, fuckboy tears of sorrow.\n\nI apologize.\n\nThe two recent articles on Boyce Watkins stirred up a lot of controversy about a lot of things. Two things, in particular, made their way to the mailbag. The first is from some of Watkins\u2019 adherents:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the past year, I have come to understand a valuable truth about myself and one of my greatest weaknesses. Some may even call it an obsession. It is this:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can\u2019t stand to see anyone take advantage of black people.\n\nIt makes me genuinely upset, and sometimes in my furor, I attack people. When I berate white people for their participation in white supremacy, some of the people who age like buttermilk left in the back seat of a Buick on a summer day (see ... there I go again) believe that it means I hate all white people. When I call out preachers who use the Bible as a means of spreading white people\u2019s messaging while stuffing their pockets with black people\u2019s hard-earned money, some Jesus worshippers view it as an attack on Christianity.\n\nAnd, yes, when I impugn the characters of people like Umar Johnson and Boyce Watkins for using the plight of black people to enrich themselves by duping people who have fallen prey to their cult of personality, as well as to trade in homophobia, misogyny and transphobia, some see it as an attack on black people, Pan-Africanism and cultural knowledge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am fine with that.\n\nI realize that some white people believe in whiteness like some Christians believe in their pastors, like some black people believe in anyone who feeds them a fetishized bullshit narrative. Those people have faith. I will never change their minds because they believe in the people, not the ideas.\n\nBut I won\u2019t stop trying.\n\nBecause\u2014even when they\u2019re black\u2014those people are using blackness as a way to target my people. Johnson and Watkins are no different from Creflo Dollar or the Democratic Party. They mean us no good. They just want power and money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the entire time I\u2019ve written for The Root, I have never had a white person tell me what I could and couldn\u2019t write. In fact, aside from the directive from my black editors that I couldn\u2019t call Ray Lewis a \u201ccoon\u201d that one time, I have never been told by anyone what I couldn\u2019t say at The Root. No, we are not black-owned. But we are operated and run by black people and use our platform for black people. But I\u2019m sure that when you\u2019re typing your comments on white-owned Facebook\u2019s platform, Mark Zuckerberg sends you a private message telling you what you can and can\u2019t say.\n\nSo while you think you are dissing me for calling out charlatans, con men and people who scream about white supremacy only because they want the opportunity to get rich and control women, gays and transgender people, I actually take it as a compliment.\n\nFuck those guys.\n\nAnd, finally, Boyce Watkins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore last week, I had never followed Boyce Watkins and was only marginally aware of him. It was members of the Black Business School who pointed out this story to The Root and gave us the specifics, which means that if he feels attacked, he should confront his own customers.\n\n\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think Watkins is upset with The Root. He is pretending to be upset because his stream of revenue has been threatened. Who else is he going to attack\u2014the white guy and Asian guy who called him a \u201ccharacter\u201d whom they use to sell \u201chope and emotion\u201d as a \u201creligion\u201d to black people? They\u2019re his business partners. They created and control the \u201ceducational product\u201d he sells. Except for the email where he called their comments \u201crude and culturally insensitive,\u201d he has not distanced himself from the guys who said publicly, \u201cWe don\u2019t have to educate them.\u201d He remains in bed with people who don\u2019t seem to give a fuck about black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, during this whole ordeal, I gave Watkins the benefit of the doubt, as did some of the members of his organization who spoke with us. We all believed that he was being duped, too. They figured that he probably had no idea that the medicine he was selling to black people was just a placebo. But now I think differently.\n\nDespite the fact that he has not disproven a single fact in the story and, in fact, confirmed them all, Watkins has defended himself by telling his people that he was not given the opportunity to speak on the record:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe truth is this:\n\n\n\nOn Friday, Feb. 2, four days before this story went live, I sent Watkins an email inviting him to speak on the record. I sent a media request to Watkins\u2019 personal page. I sent him a message on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, he has continued to publicly say that he was not contacted, despite the fact that we posted his company\u2019s entire email response to the article. When he made these public statements, the petty part of me posted screenshots of my attempts to contact him:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe repeatedly deleted them.\n\nWatkins might not be a con man. He might be serious about helping black people achieve financial freedom. Maybe he believes that working with men who don\u2019t care about black people is the only way he can achieve his goals. But there is one thing you can be sure of:\n\n\n\nBoyce Watkins is a liar.", "keywords": ["clapback", "roots", "fact", "using", "dont", "mailbag", "rev", "black", "mans", "watkins", "apology", "white", "way", "im"], "polarity": 0.02524870962370963, "subjectivity": 0.4430071086321085},

But because of my dedication to the readers of The Root, I crawled out of bed to respond to a few emails, tweets, comments and direct messages we receive during the week. (And because, when I told my editor, Yesha Callahan, about my sickness, she sympathetically said, \u201cSooo ... you gonna do the mailbag or nah?\u201d)\n\nIf the flu kills me and I die at this keyboard, know that I made this sacrifice for you. Tell my grandchildren about how I used to clap back. Avenge my death!

Remember I loved you all!*\n\n* (Unless Yesha\u2019s reading this.)\n\nThis first item is meant to address one of the most frequent complaints received by The Root. I have been emailed by numerous white women arguing the same point, which is the most white-womanish point ever:\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nFrom L. Greenbow\n\nSubject: Your hate for white women I am numb to your treatment of white women because you want to throw stones at them so much that people don\u2019t pay attention to it anymore. What bothers me it when you keep pushing the narrative that 53% of white women voted for Trump. That is not the case. 53% of white women voters voted for Trump. Most white women did not vote for him because only a small porecetage one the population votes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd here is another comment from a reader named \u201cGet some Dak Sausage,\u201d who posted about it multiple times in a post that had nothing to do with Donald Trump, white women or even politics. They complained about Senior Editor Stephen Crockett\u2019s use of the stat in several comments:\n\nYes. I\u2019m saying that factually roughly 25% of white women voted for Trump. That\u2019s a fact. I\u2019m not talking about how complicit everyone feels the roughly half of white women that didn\u2019t vote are.\n\nDear L and Get:\n\nI apologize sincerely from the bottom of my heart. When I wrote that 53 percent of white women voted for Trump, I made a mistake. In my haste to be accurate and fair, I may have sullied the good name of the Caucasian sheroes who historically get to benefit from the conquering, colonizing white supremacist manifest destiny embedded in their male counterparts without bloodying their hands or mussing their silky blond hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI meant \u201cwhite women.\u201d\n\nI know that white women enjoy an unparalleled entitlement gifted to them at birth that follows them around for their entire lives. It\u2019s not even their fault. It\u2019s society\u2019s fault. White women are the shit. Even a balloon-shaped Becky gets to be a trophy for\u2014if no one else\u2014a self-hating black man. Our last two first ladies have been an Ivy League-educated attorney and a plain-old skinny, generic, white mail-order bride Trump got from eBay. White women have it made.\n\nBut even though they don\u2019t have to adhere to the rules of society, they at least have to acknowledge the existence of the motherfucking language. The language of politics and democracy doesn\u2019t genuflect simply because you have an oatmeal-colored vagina.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I say, \u201cThe Atlanta Falcons blew a 23-point lead in the Super Bowl,\u201d the players who didn\u2019t get in the game never email me saying: \u201cI was on the bench. I didn\u2019t have anything to do with that.\u201d When Trump says he was \u201celected by the American people,\u201d he doesn\u2019t parse it by saying, \u201cThe less-than-half who voted for me.\u201d When people say Barack Obama \u201cwon the black vote,\u201d Omarosa, Ben Carson, and Diamond and Silk didn\u2019t raise their hands to object. That\u2019s not how teams work. That\u2019s not how democracy works. That\u2019s not how anything else works.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, let\u2019s say I agreed with your premise. Doesn\u2019t that make white women more complicit? Who should I absolve? The white women who would have voted for Hillary Clinton but stayed their asses home?\n\nWhite people voted for Trump.

PEOPLE JUST CANNOT HANDLE ALL THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF WHITES IN EVERY FIELD AND THE WORLD IS EXTREMELY JEALOUS OF WHITE MEN AND WHITE WOMEN. WHITES ARE GETTING RAPED AND KILLED BY NON WHITES IN FAR GREATER RATES THAN VISA VERSA. THE WHITE CHRIATIAN IS UNDER ATTACK BY THE WHOLE WORLD. JESUS PREDICTED THIS WHEN HE SAID \u201cTHEY HATED ME AND THEY WILL HATE AND PERCECUTE YOU.\u201d ISLAM IS A GARBAGE SICK VILE RELIGION THAT HONORS A MURDERER AND PEDOPHILE MOHAMMED. THEY ATTACK WHITE CHRISTIANS JUST FOR BEING WHITE CHRISTIANS; FOR NO OTHER REASON. INVTHIS COUNTRY A WHITE CANNOT WALKBINCA BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD OERIOD. THEY WILL BE UNDER ATTACK AND ROBBED RAPED OR MURDERED QUICKEY; I MYSELF HAVE BEEN BEATEN TO A RAW BLOODY PULP BY BLACKS IN BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS WHEN I TRIED TO VISIT BLACK FRIENDS. TJEY BEAT ME UP JYST BECAUSE IM WHITE AND BECAUSE THEY CAN NEVER EVER EVER WIN A DEBATE WITH ME. THE TRUTH WILL SET EVERYONE FREE. HOW IS IT RACIST FOR A WHITE PERSON TO WANT TO PRESERVE WHITE CHRISTIAN CULTURE THAT BUILT THE WHITE COUNTRIES AND THE USA AND CANADA ? LOOKCAT HAITI\u2014 IT HAS BEEN BLACK RULED FOR 200 YEARS AND IS A TOTAL VIOLENT CEESPOOL. NO ONE WANTS TO LIVE THERE. LOOK AT THE AFRICAN COUNTRIES. NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD MOVE THERE. THE PEOPLE ARE. DEMON POSSESSED. RACIST KILLERS OF WHITE CHRISTIAN PEOPLE. OH NO ?? TRY TO WALK AROUND IN AN AFRICAN COUNTRY AFTER DARK\u2014 YOU WILL BE EXECUTED FAST. YOU SAY NO ??

PEOPLE MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR SHORTCOMINGS AND PROBLEMS THEY CREATE AND NOT BLAME OTHER RACES FOR THEIR FAILURES. THE WHITE RACE HAS LITERALKY SAVED OVER ONE BILLUON LIVES BY THE HIGH TECH MEDICINE THEY HAVE DEVELOPED. NO OTHER PEOPLE ON EARTH GAVED SAVED SO MANY LUVES. THINK OF ALL THE MILLUONS OF DOSES OF LUFE SAVING MEDICINES WHITES HAVE GIVEN THE WHOLE WORLD AND SAVED HUNDREDSVOF MILLIONSOF LIVES. I REPEAT. NON WHITE MEN HAVE NOT DONE THIS YET.

They go about their business, and for the most part never consider their race. To a white man he is merely another human. I certainty never though much about race until I got tired of my people being denigrated at every turn. White people are the only race of people taught to hate and disrespect their own ancestors and history. But women, all women see life through the lens of being a women not a human. For black people everything centers around being black. Gays and lesbians build their entire existence around the fact they are homosexual. Muslims are completely consumed by Islam. Meanwhile, the white man is a blank slate navigating life based on logic and experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNah, the difference between white men and and everyone else is this:\n\nYou believe you get to control the world.\n\nThat\u2019s it. You think you can rape, kill, pillage, steal, colonize and enslave at your will. It is in your DNA. You are the scourge of the earth. You tortured my ancestors, raped Africa, committed genocide against the Jews, Native Americans, Haitians, every island in the Caribbean, the Aztecs, the Inca, the Aborigine and every native population on earth. You are the destruction of the planet. If the devil has a face, he is a white man. You will one day pay for your misdeeds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m just kidding.\n\nI know you two letter writers didn\u2019t do any of that, just like I know Joseph hasn\u2019t invented anything in his life. He doesn\u2019t even have the technical literacy to find the \u201ccaps lock\u201d key, so I know he\u2019s not creating anything in his garage, unless you count meth. I don\u2019t.\n\nMy point is that Joseph and Adolph don\u2019t get to live by two sets of rules. They don\u2019t get to enjoy the privilege of individuality by dissociating themselves from Nazis, domestic terrorists and white supremacists and then castigate others by lumping all other groups into a basket based on stereotypes. So I say this to all white people:\n\nPick one.\n\nEven though I am an educated black man with an IQ high enough to hit the \u201cshift\u201d key, I\u2019m fine with you thinking I might be a stupid gangbanger or a criminal. But if we are going to play that game, you have to admit your personal responsibility for every \u201cshithole\u201d around the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf I am to be a thug, then you have to admit that you are Adolf Hitler and the Ku Klux Klan. If an individual Muslim should automatically be assumed to be a terrorist, then I should assume that all white men are the same as the scum who dragged Emmett Till out of bed or slaughtered billions of babies around the world to make way for white rule.\n\nI\u2019m not accusing you, or any white person, of anything. I\u2019m just saying: If we are going to play the game, pick a set of rules so that I can know which game we are playing.\n\nAnd for God\u2019s sake, hit the goddamn \u201ccaps lock\u201d key!", "keywords": ["horribles", "clapback", "roots", "whites", "basket", "mailbag", "trump", "know", "women", "voted", "men", "black", "white", "im", "say"], "polarity": 0.0025409052312605736, "subjectivity": 0.3439361794437936},

This lede was gonna be funny as hell, too. I was going to explain how this week\u2019s collection of emails, tweets and direct messages were all about politics and how people insert their political assumptions into whatever they read. This sentence was supposed to make a hilarious comparison about how every presidential candidate I\u2019ve ever voted for was also the one least likely to make me throw up if I saw them naked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut because of Yesha\u2019s incessant, racist harassment of me and my below-average typing skills, y\u2019all will miss out. You deserve better than this, but you only have Yesha to blame. Anyway, since I don\u2019t have time to craft a funny lede for the mailbag, Here\u2019s some mail.\n\nIt\u2019s a half day! I\u2019m not working beyond 10 a.m. So what a half-day means 1 p.m.? \u2014Yesha\n\nMerry Christmas, motherfuckers.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s an email from a fan of both Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party concerning the article about Doug Jones:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Starr C.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Who sent you? Niggers like you are why black people can\u2019t get anywhere. First you wrote that piece of trash about Doug Jones flyer, then you bash the democratic party. Your always bashing Hillary and democrats, because you and the rest rest of the Bernie bros are still mad that she beat him FAIR AND SQUARE!!!! You at the reason Trump won. I bet you voted for him, but even if you didn\u2019t you spent so much time bashing Hillary that you paved the way for him. You don\u2019t even realize that the republicans don\u2019t mena black people no good. Every time you bash the democrats,you\u2019re helping them. You might as well be the KKK.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019re right, Starr. You figured it out. I\u2019m the reason Hillary lost.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that she took states in the Rust Belt for granted. It wasn\u2019t that she called black people \u201csuperpredators.\u201d It wasn\u2019t because she has such a long history of underhanded shenanigans that President Barack Obama\u2019s voters felt no enthusiasm for her. It wasn\u2019t that she popped up at black churches and barbershops pandering to black people with the see-through bullshittery of how one of her best friends from college \u201cis African American.\u201d\n\nIt was me the whole time.\n\nHad I been \u201cwith her,\u201d she would\u2019ve won because I would\u2019ve told her ass to stop cheating so much. I would have told her not to try to rig the primaries. I would have told the Democratic Party to stop assuming they had the black vote by default. I would have told her to put something about black lives and police brutality in her platform before Black Lives Matter literally forced her to do it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI would have told her to stop lying and fainting. I would have given her something better to wear than pastel-colored karate suits. I would have told her to stop warmongering and nation building. And lying. And fainting. I would have asked her why the fuck was she so moderate? I would have asked her why she was chasing white voters like they owed her $20. I would have made her secure the bag.\n\nMost importantly, had I been with her, I never would have made her, Doug Jones, the Democratic Party or any other white person on the face of the earth into a savior.\n\nThe reason they treat black people like shit is that too many of us believe that just because Hillary, Doug or any other Democrat is slightly better than a Republican, we should be afraid to publicly criticize them. The Democratic Party is the proverbial plantation from which black people are afraid to run because our massa is slightly more benevolent than the other slave owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am sorry Donald Trump is president, but I am not sorry that Hillary Clinton is not my president.\n\nFuck her.\n\nI do not want a slightly better slave master.\n\nI want to be free.\n\nHere\u2019s an email from a Bernie Sanders supporter:\n\n\n\nFrom: Karla P.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Bernie would of won. I loved your piece on the Cornel West feud. I just have one thing to say about your criticism of Bernie Sanders. I know the black community was pulling for Hillary because we blindly vote for whichever Democrat they give us, but her record shows that she was never going to do anything for us. She didn\u2019t do anything for us as a Senator. She didn\u2019t take a stand for us during her husband\u2019s presidency or during her campaign. What you don\u2019t realize about Bernie is that he has been fighting for us since the civil rights movement. Our allegiance to the Democratic party is what kills us politically because they take our votes for granted. The only way our votes will ever matter is if we make politicians earn it. If not for people like you Constantly kissing Hillary\u2019s ass and downing candidates like Bernie, he would of won. Stop leading your people like sheep to the slaughter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHey, Karla!\n\nThank you so much for your kind words in the first paragraph. As for the second part of your email\u2014I\u2019m sorry you feel that way.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, Karla: I am a fan of Bernie Sanders. I want to meet him one day and shake his old, wrinkled hand because I bet it feels like grabbing a pack of hot dogs wrapped in a silk handkerchief. I know it would probably give me the heaves, but I just want to see how it feels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for Bernie as a candidate? He lost, boo. You and the rest of his supporters can stop crying those socialist Democrat white tears any day now. Let that shit go! I know you think Hillary rigged the race, and so do I. But you know what? That\u2019s your fault. What the fuck is wrong with you that you sided with the one white motherfucker on the planet with too much integrity to cheat?\n\nI\u2019m why Bernie lost?\n\nOld man Sanders lost because he brought a rusty-ass, antique knife to a gunfight. I wish politics were more honest, but as long as they aren\u2019t, I want someone who\u2019s willing to slit throats, not some decrepit, counterfeit do-gooder in a J.C. Penney\u2019s suit! Do you know what would have happened if Bernie were in office? The Republican majority in the House and Senate would have eaten him alive and spit him out. Because\u2014and I\u2019m just guessing here\u2014he tastes like a sixth-grade social studies test boiled in hot dog water.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think the only hope for American politics is a true third-party candidate, so I feel no allegiance to the Democratic or Republican Party. I vote for the candidate I want to win, and 99.9 percent of the time, that candidate is a Democrat.\n\nI liked many of Bernie\u2019s ideas and political theories. But I like them in the same way I like the idea of eating a box of hot Krispy Kreme doughnuts while sitting courtside at the Staples Center during Game 7 of the NBA Finals as Lonzo Ball passes the ball to the newly signed LeBron James, who hits the game-winning shot for the Lakers. And as I\u2019m being hugged by Beyonc\u00e9, I barely have time to high-five Colin Kaepernick and congratulate him on his new job as the starting quarterback of the Carolina Diddies before Rihanna taps me on the shoulder and asks me if I want to go to the bathroom and hit the blunt with her, but I can\u2019t ... because you know how my wife gets mad because Rihanna is always sweatin\u2019 me, and I don\u2019t want to argue in the helicopter on the way home.\n\nA Bernie Sanders presidency is as unlikely as that scenario.\n\nKrispy Kreme donuts are trash. Also, I hate the way you\u2019ve just spelled \u201cdoughnuts.\u201d \u2014Yesha\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext are a series of direct messages from a Trump supporter on Twitter named Robert O. You probably wouldn\u2019t be able to understand them, but because I\u2019ve corresponded with so many low-IQ white people since I\u2019ve begun my stint at The Root, I have become fluent in the \u201calt-right\u201d dialect of English. Each one of these is actually a separate message.\n\n\n\nUr a duck\n\nI think he means \u201ccuck,\u201d which is short for \u201ccuckold,\u201d a man who likes to watch other men have sex with their wives. It\u2019s a popular term for people on the alt-right to use against other white men who aren\u2019t as racist as them. Some white people believe that if they aren\u2019t racist enough, they won\u2019t be able to stop the impending black-penis attack that \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d are planning.\n\nCuck\n\nSee, I told you.\n\nAnd a beta male\n\nA beta male is a weak man, not like a strong alpha male. Or maybe he thinks I pledged a white fraternity. Are betas a thing? Can they step?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis one I\u2019m not too sure about.\n\nUr politics are garbage\n\nWe use \u201ctrash\u201d now, Robert.\n\nBy the way, I just looked at your name, and it is one of the few names that are equidistant from both the center of blackness and whiteness. \u201cRobert\u201d isn\u2019t a black name or a white name. It\u2019s just a name. It\u2019s a manly name, though. Roberts probably work hard all day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI often try to imagine what people do just from their names and the letters they write, and I bet you wear gloves to work, Robert. You\u2019re probably employed on a highway crew or cutting meat behind the glass at a grocery store. Yeah, butcher is definitely a \u201cRobert\u201d job. You don\u2019t find many Roberts in the baking or choreographer industries. But I digress ...\n\nUr view all trump supporters are nazis is garbage\n\nThanks for helping my argument, Rob.\n\nAnd ur articles are trash\n\nThat\u2019s fair. See, I told you \u201ctrash\u201d sounds much better!\n\nYou\u2019re welcome!\n\nBlack women are ashy white women are bitchy Asian women eat cats and Hispanic women have fat asses we all have stereotypes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait, Rob, that\u2019s your list of stereotypes? I feel like you could use some help in the stereotyping department. I don\u2019t want to sound racist, but you\u2019re missing out on some good ones.\n\nAll you have for black women is that they\u2019re ashy? Also, are you sure you want to give the \u201cfat asses\u201d to Hispanic women? I would never impugn your racist credentials, but I feel like, statistically speaking ...\n\nYou know what? Imma let you have this one.\n\nSo stop being a faggot\n\nBut I thought I was a cuck? You\u2019re confusing me, Rob. Am I an amphibious bird, the husband of an adulteress or a bundle of sticks? Make up your mind! And why are you on Twitter so much? Those yellow lines aren\u2019t going to paint themselves!\n\nAnd ban me from twitter u west coast lookin. Bitch\n\nWait ... I can do that?\n\nAnd, finally, from a supporter of ... umm, white people?\n\n\n\nFrom: Mitch There\u2019s no need to take sole credit for the Black Community, Michael. Yes they contributed mightily, but so did the media, thousands of volunteers, women, college-age voters (check the campus-town votes), Republicans who refused to vote, Richard Shelby (the write-in votes alone would have made up the difference) and a shit candidate. Happy to see it all working. Let\u2019s keep it all energized for high voter turnout in 2018 and 2020. Identity politics spells losses. It\u2019s wins that count, not credit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of clapping back at Mitch, I\u2019d like to critique and highlight some of my favorite parts of this Twitter direct message.\n\nThe part about how \u201cthere\u2019s no need to take sole credit for the Black Community\u201d is good, because it insinuates that there was another community that voted for Doug Jones. White women voted for Roy Moore. White men voted for Roy Moore. Black men and women voted for Doug Jones. But history shows us that when a white person tells you \u201cthere\u2019s no need\u201d for something, they are about to steal that shit.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s another good part: \u201cYes they contributed mightily but ... \u201d Always remember that everything after the word \u201cbut\u201d is always a lie.\n\nThen there\u2019s the part where he credits \u201cthe media ... volunteers, women, college-age voters ... \u201d Again, he\u2019s white-peopleing. If he extrapolated the statistical data using this thing called \u201cmath\u201d and applied it to college-age voters, he\u2019d see that white college students voted for Roy Moore. The same is true for the campus towns, women, people named \u201cNancy,\u201d people who like hot sauce instead of honey mustard and even praise dancers. This white boy just cannot give black people their due!\n\nWait ... did this motherfucker just say, \u201cRepublicans who refused to vote\u201d? REPUBLICANS WHO REFUSED TO VOTE? He\u2019s so desperate in his white-mannery that he thinks Republicans who didn\u2019t vote are the same as the black people who caused the biggest political upset since Philip \u201cUncle Phil\u201d Banks was elected to a district court judgeship on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. According to Mitch, here\u2019s who should share the glory (in no particular order): black people who voted, white people who overwhelmingly voted for the guy who lost, people doing their motherfucking jobs and white people who did abso-fucking-lutely nothing. That might be the whitest thing ever said, but you gotta admit: It\u2019s a damn good part.\n\nYou might not have noticed the part where he said: \u201cLet\u2019s keep it all working.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s\u201d as in \u201clet us.\u201d You think Mitch has some black people in his pocket? Who the fuck is the \u201cus\u201d? You think I don\u2019t know the old Caucasian \u201cwe won\u201d trick, Mitch? I liked that part, though. If only for its sliminess.\n\nBut my favorite part? The part where this glib stool sample of alabaster arrogance said: \u201cIdentity politics spells losses. It\u2019s wins that count, not credit.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoy Moore appealing to white voters wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d Talking about protecting Confederate monuments wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d Acting as if the Lord and Savior Jesus Harrison Christ commanded those who believeth in him to vote for Moore wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d Doug Jones mailing a racist-adjacent flyer with a black man bug-a-booing on the front like a new-millennium Sambo wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019 repeated invocation of the names of the four little girls killed in the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church every time he got in front of black people, as if those victims gave him a political endorsement, wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d\n\nBut me pointing out the statistical fact that black people were the only group who supported Jones, while white people from Alabama acted like white people from Alabama always do, but they now want credit for some shit they didn\u2019t do ... I\u2019m the one playing \u201cidentity politics.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s one of my favorite parts.", "keywords": ["clapback", "roots", "told", "vote", "politics", "wasnt", "mailbag", "black", "identity", "women", "voted", "title", "insert", "white", "bernie", "clever"], "polarity": 0.0626698244677697, "subjectivity": 0.450799465628233},

Because of black people, senators might be able to stop Congress from making it rain on the top 1 percent with the GOP billionaire tax plan. Because of black people, we might be able to stop Donald Trump from appointing Simon Cowell to the Supreme Court (the Donald is a fan of the judging on American Idol, and Paula Abdul has that filthy Muslim name). Because of black people, we might finally be rid of the only white man in history suffering from acute ashiness\u2014Steve Bannon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was a close call, Alabama.

I examine them for white tears, anger and racism and formulate a response in my head. Then I look at my computer and say:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do that shit in the morning.\u201d\n\nYes, I am a \u201clate motherfucker.\u201d\n\nI am one of the precious few people who have been endowed with the special gift of never being on time. I am always late. Late motherfuckers don\u2019t enjoy being late. Instead, we have a disability that prevents us from being on time, unlike some people who wake up at the crack of dawn and start working diligently. (I won\u2019t mention any names. Let\u2019s just say she might be a deputy managing editor at The Root.) I honestly think I should get disability and one of those parking decals so I can park up front and rush in.\n\nMy late-motherfucker-ness came in handy today because this was a slow week for hate mail. Then, at the last minute, it flooded in like white tears at a Black Lives Matter rally. I say all of this to ask a favor of the haters:\n\nCan you be a little more prompt?\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: For the record, I was up at 4 a.m. today and waited hours for this post ... because Negroes are always late. I thank my Irish side for never being a late Negro. \u2014Yesha]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs an example of how being a late motherfucker works, our first item is a comment from JC-Sean, who took umbrage with me calling Post Malone a \u201ccultural appropriator\u201d in a post from a few hours ago.\n\n\u201cCultural appropriation\u201d is the very definition of hypocrisy. Our society is a mixing pot of culture, meaning everyone from every background takes some aspects of another previous society and implements them to their needs. I needn\u2019t list off the dozens of things white culture has created that black culture has taken advantage of. If Post doesn\u2019t want to be known as a rapper and simply as a musician, who are you to question him? If society relies on pure feelings as it is, then what makes his claim unjustified in comparison?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear JC-Sean:\n\nI was all set to clap back at your white nonsense about cultural appropriation. It was going to be good, too. I was going to write how you, like many others who present this ignorant argument, have no idea what cultural appropriation actually means. I was going to explain to you like you are 5 years old how cultural appropriation has nothing to do with taking \u201caspects of another previous society\u201d and using them for one\u2019s needs.\n\nDamn, JC, I was going to roast your ass for being so dumb that you think using an art form, invention or technique created by another culture is \u201ccultural appropriation.\u201d My best line was going to be, \u201cNigga, I\u2019m not accusing every motherfucker who uses fire or a wheel of stealing from Cro-Magnon man!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen I was going to rip apart your kindergarten-slow-class-like logic by explaining that there is a difference between Eminem immersing himself in a culture, respecting it and contributing to the art form and Post Malone using the art form to make millions while simultaneously saying: \u201cDon\u2019t lump me in with those niggers. I\u2019m a musician, not a rapper.\u201d Then I was going to explain how he gets to dabble in the stereotype of hip-hop while enjoying the privilege of not having to deal with the consequences.\n\nMy only problem was, I needed an analogy to illustrate my argument. If only there were some incident that could show how Malone\u2019s whiteness means that he isn\u2019t treated like the black artists he emulates with his Caucasian step-and-fetch-it-ery. I desperately needed a way to prove that Malone gets to enjoy the societal privilege of being white and pocket the money from his pseudo-black stereotype. I must admit, JC, that I was stuck.\n\nAnd then this happened:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, that is Post Malone, on video in Las Vegas, the recent site of one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history, riding around with a machine gun mounted atop a truck.\n\nPost Malone is not in jail.\n\nPost Malone is still alive.\n\nShut the fuck up, JC.\n\nOur next clapback comes from an accident:\n\n\n\nYesterday, while searching for something on the internet, Producer Danielle Young discovered that there is a whole section of YouTube devoted to black conservatives clapping back at The Root.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are two of my favorites:\n\nAnd this dude, who calls himself \u201cUncle Hotep\u201d and spends a lot of time attacking black people in videos:\n\nI must be honest: I thoroughly enjoyed these niggas, in the same way people enjoy watching Bumfights and Jackass. I actually subscribed to their channels after watching a few of their videos because I sometimes need to remind myself what the opposite of \u201cself-aware\u201d is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext week, no one will be talking about the Erykah Badu article or that wig-wearing mop bucket who called April Ryan out of her name, and I can use these videos to help me become a better person. I\u2019m just going to scroll through them every now and then, and if I ever hear any of them say anything and think to myself, \u201cYou know, that guy makes a lot of sense,\u201d then I\u2019ll know what to do next:\n\nSlit my motherfucking throat.\n\nThe next clapback comes via an email written by a reader who disagreed with the article disparaging the Democratic Party.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: DJ\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Thanks You\u2019re a racist but you\u2019re right that democrats aren\u2019t friends of struggling communities. They love poverty. They keep people addicted to crumbs without teaching/promoting how to be independently successful and self reliant. They love when writers like you promulgate victim hood because it keeps people victims. When the black Fordham law professor wtites an article saying black people are disabled(link below), they cheer. If a person is disabled or a victim, they need help. So yeah, they\u2019ll keep giving those crumbs to the victims....in exchange for votes. They won\u2019t tell the victims they can succeed through hard work and making good decisions.(see Asian and black immigrants) Then they wouldn\u2019t need the Democrat\u2019s loving help. It\u2019s ethereal whiteness that\u2019s holding people back. Hmm, something that can\u2019t be quantified so can never be proven to be ended. That\u2019s the perfect boogeyman to keep people addicted to oppression. Maybe this is your wakeup call. I hope you\u2019re not as stupid as you are racist. Sincerely, Dj\n\nDearest Dj:\n\nFirst, I\u2019d like to thank you for recognizing both my stupidity and my racism and agreeing with me that the Democratic Party is trash. When I saw your link from the Fordham professor, I also agreed with you that it is a stupid idea to equate being black with being disabled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen I read the article from the link you sent from that bullshit right-wing site and the original article from Kimani Paul-Emile, who is an associate professor of law and director of Fordham University\u2019s Center on Race, Law, and Justice. After reading all of this, I sympathized with you because I quickly realized that one of my theories is correct:\n\nWhite people can\u2019t read.\n\nI realized this because Paul-Emile specifically wrote, \u201cBlackness, of course, is not, by itself, an impairment.\u201d Then I realized, after noting that the article explains that she is using the concept of disability law because \u201cit accurately reflects what Black, as a racial designation, is and was designed to be: disabling. Racial categories were created explicitly to serve as a caste system to privilege some and disadvantage others ... ,\u201d that you probably didn\u2019t read that part, because it is in the first sentence!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is what white people like you will do.\n\nYou plant the seeds of racism in every square inch of fertile soil, and when the poisonous flowers bloom, you wonder why we\u2019re sick. You accuse people of acting like victims because they\u2019re allergic to hate.\n\nI have seen the rape, oppression, torture, thievery and hate you spread around the world. You are a scourge of humanity, Dj. You are a monster. No one is afraid of \u201cboogeymen.\u201d But to quote Kevin Spacey from the great documentary The Usual Suspects:\n\n\u201cThe greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis second greatest?\n\nCreating Dj.", "keywords": ["clapback", "roots", "article", "appropriation", "mailbag", "going", "late", "art", "post", "culture", "black", "white", "cultural", "lastminute", "malone"], "polarity": 0.027621882086167802, "subjectivity": 0.4252031368102795},

It also gave us an outlet that wasn\u2019t limited to, \u201cCan you believe what this motherfucker just wrote me?\u201d But now that we\u2019ve been doing this for a few months, I\u2019ve realized something:\n\nRacists aren\u2019t very original.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t mean to upset the hardworking racist community out there by disparaging their work ethic. I would, in no way, demean you by besmirching the sheer volume of work put in every day by the people whose hearts are filled with what I imagine to be terrible things like black jellybeans, the crotches of Donald Trump\u2019s post-golf tighty-whities and the rag used to clean Harvey Weinstein\u2019s house plant.\n\nThe problem is that along with being not very smart, racism gets boring after a while. It\u2019s not that I am no longer offended\u2014I never really get mad at people calling me \u201cnigger\u201d anonymously; it\u2019s just that I\u2019m no longer entertained. Maybe I have become numb to racism, and every form of it has now become banal. Maybe I\u2019m just jaded like an EMT who can scrape brains off the concrete after a car wreck while eating a peanut butter and Jelly sandwich.\n\nIn any case, I\u2019m calling for all you racists out there to inject some thought, originality or at least some common sense into your correspondence. If not, we run the risk of excluding you from the mailbag totally, and no one wants that. The only other solution is, maybe you guys will stop being racist and ...\n\nNah, that\u2019ll never work.\n\nOur first correspondence concerns an article about an Air Force sergeant who went on a racist rant.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Gary\n\nTo: Anne Branigin\n\nSubject: Feedback. ..airforce sergeant under investigation for racist rant How in the hell is this racist? All she said was \u201cblack\u201d...last I checked, saying \u201cblack females \u201c is not a racial slur. Talking about getting over sensitive and over reacting. So unless you\u2019re kissing black people ass, you\u2019re a racist. Thats bullshit. I\u2019ve also ran into quite a few black people with attitude in my life,as have I ran into alot of white people with attitude. ..no difference. ..attitude is attitude. Race dont mean shit when it comes to attitude. But since shes not black...then shes a racist?? Pfft. Ok,then...good luck with that. How about Mr. Chi from SNL... he called Trump a \u201ccracker\u201d tell me, why in the hell is that NOT racist? Cracker IS a racial slur when referring to whites. How about all the blacks that call each other \u201cnigger\u201d...if black people say it, its NOT racist, but anyone else... they\u2019re racist. Fuckin double standard in this country is getting WAAAAAY out of hand. They can\u2019t have it both ways. Is it racist...or \u201ca term of endearment\u201d as Kanye West once said? Make up your minds. Either way...for a black person to call a white person \u201ccracker\u201d or \u201cwonderbread\u201d or any of the other slurs they use, thats racist and makes them fucking Hypocrites too. If we all truely want to end racism, we need to stop getting our pants in a bunch over every little thing that has the slightest possibility of being racist, as well as holding EVERYONE, regardless of race, to the SAME standards. Just an opinion Thank you for your time\n\nHey, Gary:\n\nThere\u2019s a thing you need to know about racism: I don\u2019t say this to be combative. I genuinely hope that you will share it with your friends at the rallies and cross burnings:\n\nNo one gives a fuck what your white ass thinks about racism.\n\nStop thinking you get to decide or have a voice in anything about the subject. White people thinking they get to define racism is the same thing as a person who is accused of sexual assault climbing on the witness stand and presenting this legal defense:\n\n\u201cBut it was just date rape, right? I mean ... she\u2019s given consent to other men, so why should she be so mad at what I did? I don\u2019t see anything wrong with it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, Gary, I know you\u2019re dumb, so I\u2019m going to explain to you how white supremacy works:\n\nThe woman in this particular article is an officer in the armed forces\u2014an organization that has a strict hierarchy. She also holds an innate prejudice against black women, as do many others. In her world, her feelings are so uncontroversial and widespread that she was comfortable enough to share them on the internet.\n\nI presume that the airwoman, as a member of the Air Force, will be promoted multiple times. She will undoubtedly have women of color under her command. Those women\u2019s careers and lives will depend on a woman who not only doesn\u2019t give a fuck about them but also lives in a world that confirms her prejudices. Those black women under her command won\u2019t have the same opportunities as a white man or a white woman under the same command\u2014even if the black women are as smart, talented and hardworking as their white counterparts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr maybe she won\u2019t have a long career in the military. Maybe she\u2019ll get out and do one of the jobs most popular with military vets, like becoming a teacher or working in human resources or\u2014better yet\u2014law enforcement. I\u2019m sure her racism won\u2019t matter in those places.\n\nThat\u2019s how white supremacy works.\n\nHere\u2019s another way that it works: A man with the IQ of a three-toed sloth could watch that racist rant and say to himself: \u201cHow in the hell is this racist? In fact, I think I\u2019m going to fire off a sternly worded email about this! And while I\u2019m at it ... why can\u2019t I say nigger?\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis one is a direct message from Twitter user Free Radical:\n\nHello Mike! I figure I\u2019ll get right to the point: I\u2019m a sheltered white person (Spokane is white as fuck and I\u2019m an isolated nerd) who has a question, but I\u2019m worried it might be racist to ask. For starters, I know that black people are not a monolith, and I can easily see how the very notion of \u2018asking black people\u2019 could be racist. Still, the question lingers in my head. It\u2019s probably not an original question, but Google has failed me a bit in finding a comprehensive discussion of the subject. I love The Root. I love that it challenges a lot of my notions, and I\u2019m very much a fan of your work, and you\u2019re the first person I thought of that might be able to point me in a direction in which I could educate myself. My question/issue is this: I\u2019ve been listening to \u2018To Pimp a Butterfly\u2019 a lot lately, and the more I listen to it, the more I\u2019m moved by it and the more I fall in love with it. I like to post songs and lyrics on my Facebook page and share them with my friends, and I want to share this album and these songs with my friends. My question pertains to using \u2018the n-word\u2019 when quoting black artists. On one hand, I don\u2019t want to infringe on black ownership of the word. On the other, I don\u2019t want to censor the artist\u2019s work when I\u2019m sharing it. I don\u2019t want to be one of these assholes who goes \u2018hey, if they use it, I can use it,\u2019 so I\u2019m at a bit of an internal impasse. Anyway, do you know of any big articles or videos discussing this specific subject (i.e. quoting lyrics)? Either way, thank you for your time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHey, Free:\n\nFirst, I want you to know that I honestly appreciate your question. I say this with no sarcasm intended. I think your heart is in the right place and I hope you will continue to read and learn from The Root. Here is your answer:\n\nYou can\u2019t.\n\nIntentional or not, your quandary is the ultimate embodiment of white privilege. You are not actively seeking to oppress or demean anyone. In fact, it seems as if you want to do the opposite. But the notion that you are even searching for the answer to this indicates that you mean no harm, but also illustrates how you get to live in a world where you get to raise this question.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not accusing you of being a racist, and you seem to want an honest opinion. As a white person in America, you might not be as familiar with this concept as I and many other people of color are, but there is something you need to know:\n\nThere are some things you cannot do, simply because of the color of your skin. Most white people never learn this. Almost every black person has learned this lesson.\n\nYou. Cannot. Use. The. Word. Nigger.\n\nFull stop.\n\nI know, I know. It doesn\u2019t seem fair. But you must think of it this way:\n\nAt worst, you will have to suffer through the horrible possibility that you may have to wade through life under the oppression of never being able to post a Kendrick Lamar lyric on your Facebook page, with the only upside being that you have not inadvertently dredged up the history of lynching, slavery and white supremacy for the simple purpose of showing your internet friends how you totally relate to your favorite rapper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, on the plus side, you get to keep all your teeth!\n\nFrom: God Bless All Men & Women\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Prayers from white boy I pray that Jesus enters your heart and breaks the stone off of it that He loves all races as should we all.

Imma just stick with \u201cGod\u201d because I\u2019d like to think we\u2019re friends, being that you so lovingly reached out to me and you\u2019re praying for me and everything. After all, you love me. Shouldn\u2019t friends be on a first-name basis?\n\nWhen I refer to you as God, I hope it doesn\u2019t come off as blasphemous, as I do not mean to insinuate that I am talking to the God. I mean, even if I believed in her, I wouldn\u2019t think she\u2019d be stupid and illiterate. I\u2019d know that the true and living God wouldn\u2019t just make shit up because she was feeling so injured by the words that one of the lowly creatures that she created wrote on the internet. I\u2019d know that any God who even insinuated such a thing was a false God.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know what I\u2019d tell that God? I\u2019d say: \u201cStop making shit up, you lying-ass motherfucker!\u201d I\u2019d tell that bullshit God who you just made up in an email to criticize me and make yourself feel good to show me where I said \u201call.\u201d \u201cShow me!\u201d I\u2019d say.\n\nYou know what that stone-heart-breaking Jesus God of yours would do? She\u2019d admit she was wrong and apologize. And then your made-up God and I would keep talking, and I\u2019d ask why, if she loves \u201call races\u201d so much like the email writer says, then why is the floor of the Atlantic Ocean littered with skeletons of black people thrown from slave ships? Why are we always the ones mopping up blood in Audubon Ballrooms or picking up bits of brain and bone on Memphis, Tenn., motel balconies? Were they not praying loud enough when Dylann Roof plopped down on that Charleston, S.C., church pew?\n\nI appreciate your thoughts and prayers, and I do not want to slander or attack any religion ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut your God obviously hates me, and I ain\u2019t letting that motherfucker nowhere near my heart.", "keywords": ["clapback", "roots", "racist", "need", "jesus", "dont", "mailbag", "game", "know", "id", "thing", "racists", "god", "person", "black", "white", "im", "step"], "polarity": 0.017008326732902996, "subjectivity": 0.48562764291577837},

I am a Humanistic Atheist, I don\u2019t give a damn about any form of religion or Spirituality or the dumb Woke shit. The Gay Agenda is just as real as your hate for confident heterosexual Black Men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear IsAllah Self-Kingdom,\n\nFirst, I\u2019d like to congratulate you. Since I\u2019ve been a full-time employee at The Root, we have been arguing about the Hotepest name ever, and you win hands down. While I\u2019m sure you are a fine, upstanding citizen, your name has obviously done a nine-year bid in prison, where it converted to Islam. I bet your name wears a kufi, refers to pork as \u201cswine\u201d and fucks heavyset white girls on the low. I bet your real name is something like Parker Willoughby.\n\nSetting aside the Hotepery that is your name, I want to offer my sincerest condolences, because I know your secret:\n\nYou have a tiny penis, don\u2019t you, IsAllah?\n\nDon\u2019t be ashamed. It happens. That\u2019s probably why you don\u2019t believe in God, and I don\u2019t blame you.

I know men who boast about being \u201cconfident black men,\u201d but in real life, they suffer from the perpetual anger of erectile dysfunction because they can\u2019t get a spoonful of blood to flow into their thimblelike phallus. I recognized your inadequacy because your attitude resembles that of a very stupid white supremacist who claims to be \u201cthe least racist person\u201d we\u2019ll ever meet. He claims to be very smart and says he went to the best schools. I won\u2019t embarrass him by calling his name, except to say that he is a \u201cvery stable genius,\u201d just like you are a \u201cconfident, heterosexual black man\u201d who doesn\u2019t believe in God or religion but calls himself \u201cIsAllah.\u201d\n\nEarlier today, Monique Judge was giggling at guys who talk about the \u201cgay agenda.\u201d Trust me, I don\u2019t giggle. The white man makes us believe that giggling is masculine, but I overstand because I use my fourth eye. Not my third eye, because the number 3 is a relic of Christian slavery from the Holy Trinity, the three wise men and the three blind mice. (Also, my third eye is what I call my penis.)\n\nApparently, you and others live in constant fear that \u201chomosexuals\u201d have a secret plan that could convince you to eat swine and engage in same-sex shenanigans.

These people either do not know what the term means or they know and are deliberately trying to demean African history and culture. The term has been coming up a lot lately in regards to Umar Johnson. Umar has been in the headlines because he is currently under investigation and faces losing his psychology license. Umar has also been caught up in a feud with Tariq Nasheed, the director of the Hidden Colors series. Damon Young gave this definition of hotep: Over the past decade or so, the working definition of \u201cHotep\u201d has morphed into an all-encompassing term describing a person who\u2019s either a clueless parody of Afrocentricity\u2014think \u201cPreach\u201d from Don\u2019t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood\u2014or someone who\u2019s loudly, conspicuously and obnoxiously pro-black but anti-progress. As African people we have been subjected to having our history and culture degraded, distorted, and destroyed for centuries now. The people who have bastardized what hotep means are contributing to that problem. Take Michael Harriot, for example. Harriot is a writer at the Root and he is constantly using his platform there to criticize Umar Johnson. Some of these criticisms have merit, but other times they have gone so far that Harriot himself has had to apologize and admit he was wrong. In his latest article on Umar, Harriot ironically mocks Umar as being a \u201cHotepologist\u201d and miseducator, even though Harriot is operating as a miseducator himself by distorting what the term hotep means. Another article mocks the fight between Umar and Tariq as being \u201cThe Real Husbands of Hotep\u201d. Hotep means to be at peace, so how does that term fit in with the discord that we have seen being displayed between Umar and Tariq. When Umar and Seti had their feud in 2016, another writer at the Root described it as a \u201cHotep Hoedown\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Dwayne,\n\nFirst of all, I want to say: You are right.\n\nEven before I read your article, I had been conflicted about using the word \u201cHotep\u201d as a pejorative. I fully recognize the origin and the meaning of the word. As someone who came to The Root partly because of my blog NegusWhoRead [Editor\u2019s note: And because of me. \u2014Yesha], I realize the importance of taking back words that have been used against us. There is only one problem that I have:\n\nWhat will we call Hoteps?\n\nNeither Damon Young, I nor any other writer at The Root created the term \u201cHotep\u201d to describe the overly woke people who engage in misinformation and thievery against the black community. We use the word because people know what it means. But I readily admit that I fell into the trap of lazily throwing it at those who honestly seek liberation by connecting themselves with their ancestral heritage. While I do think that the default deification of everything Egyptian is problematic for a number of reasons, I recognize that \u201cHotep\u201d is a desperate clinging to a history that has been stripped away from our people by a long legacy of white supremacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTherefore, I promise that I will no longer use it in a derogatory manner. I do not speak for any other writer here, but I\u2019m going to do better. This pledge does, however, lead back to my original problem: What will we call Hoteps? (OK, that was the last time.) I have come up with a list:\n\nWhore-teps\n\n\n\nUmaricans\n\nPoor Tariq-ans\n\nAnkhologist\n\nQuack Lies Matter\n\nWokeheads\n\nNeo Not-Sees\n\nHidden Coloreds\n\nBlacksliders\n\nIsAllah Self Kingdom\n\nHopefully one of those will suffice.\n\nFrom: Justin Other Nigga\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: The Root is anti-black Hey faggot, How much do they pay you to keep bashing black men like Umar? How many people do you mentor? What are you doing for the black community? have you done anything other tna tear black men down? Why do you have so much hate for men like Umar?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Justin,\n\nLet me tell you a story.\n\nI grew up poor as fuck. Not underprivileged\u2014poor. Nights-without-electricity poor. Days-without-water poor. Cereal-and-water-for-dinner poor. I lived in a very religious household and was homeschooled until I was 12.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy first year attending school, I was excited to experience many of the things most people take for granted. I remember how incredibly pumped I was for picture day at school. When that day came, each student was supposed to bring $10 to have his or her picture taken. The night before picture day, my mother informed my sisters and me that she only had $30\u2014not enough for pictures for my three sisters and me. As the only boy in the house, I told her to let my sisters take their pictures. I was heartbroken, but I was over it by the next morning.\n\nThen a miracle happened.\n\nI swear on everything that is good and true that I exited the house on the morning of picture day, and lying on the ground was a $10 bill! I could have taken that money and had my picture taken, but I knew that the reason I couldn\u2019t take pictures was that my mother had to be dead broke. She was in her last week of college and wasn\u2019t working, so I gave her the money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was a Friday. The next day at church (we attended church on Saturdays), I watched my mother put $10 in the offering plate. I still believe that my mother put that money in the offering because she thought she was \u201csowing a seed.\u201d That\u2019s how blind, desperate faith works.\n\nAfter service that night, everyone gathered around in the church parking lot to gaze at the pastor\u2019s shiny new car. (It was a shitty Chrysler New Yorker, but to me, it was a might as well have been a Maserati.)\n\nFuck Umar Johnson and all the thieving motherfuckers sucking the souls and money from anyone hoping to sow a seed for black people because we are desperate for something ... anything. I hope they die a fiery death in the depths of hell. I want my foot to be the one that kicks them over the edge. They are worse than white supremacists. I\u2019d rather have a cross on my lawn than a hand in my pocket.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root is not making me rich. When I heard about Johnson\u2019s hearing, I was going to go whether The Root sent me or not. I had planned on paying my own way the same as I had done when I went to Ferguson, Mo.; Baltimore; Jena, Texas; and Sanford, Fla. I didn\u2019t ask a black person for a dime to go to any of those places.\n\nYes, I am a hater. I hate con men. The $10 I found on my way to school did as much good for people as the $400,000 raised by Johnson. He has never produced a business plan, budget or shred of evidence that he is starting a school. If he can prove where the money he collected went, I will take back every word I\u2019ve ever said about him. I\u2019ve done it before. I am not happy he is defrauding people who want a school for black boys. I want one, too.\n\nAs long as I have fingers to type and a platform, I will never leave him alone. So call me a faggot. I could care less about what you\u2014wait ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\n...

In fact, \u2018are\u2019, not \u2018might be\u2019, given your willingness to conflate an image of the Confederate flag with \u2018racism\u2019. Why are you attacking white people, hon? Hypocrisy really escapes you, lol? Because YOU are projecting your own racist tendencies onto anyone who rejects your embarrassingly puerile and morally and intellectually dishonest narrative. But, hey, sweets, keep it up...you are doing a fabulous job of confirming that pompously moralizing social justice warriors are nothing but self-parodying attention seekers who repel even moderate liberals. Grow up, how embarrassing for you to publicly advertise your salivating junior high mean girl malice and ignorance.\n\nFrom: Meh1234 Oh noes! Oh noes! Not the flag! Nooooooooooooo.

It\u2019s easy to blame \u201cwhites\u201d for your issues, and it\u2019s hard to actually acknowledge that your problems are created by you. The day 13% of population stops committing 50% of crimes, is the day less shooting by cops against that 13% of population will occur. Kinda like magic, really. Nothing racist about it - we\u2019re, as humans; black, white, asian, doesn\u2019t matter really, as long we don\u2019t subscribe to marxist bullshit you do - tired of your whining. The whole world is tired of your whining. Guess what? Others were \u201coppressed\u201d as well, Ottoman\u2019s Empire in Balcans was a thing for 400+ years - longer than slavery in US - and you don\u2019t hear those people whining about their ancestors and how they are owed the world, do you?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Blkk, runningnoodles and Meh1234,\n\nLook, I agree with all of you. Yesha is an oppressive racist. She makes me write that intro every week and she just asked me, \u201cWhere is the mailbag?\u201d The only reason she keeps doing this to me must be racism. #MikeLivesMatter.\n\n[It\u2019s 2:45 p.m. on Friday. I am ready to eat my edibles and drink some wine, yet here I am editing this. You are the oppressive one. \u2014Yesha]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though Blkk is right: If Keaton\u2019s mom supported \u201cthe racist BLM,\u201d Yesha would be cool with that because ... duhhh\u2014I never thought that Yesha was against white people. She even told me herself. She said to me, \u201cI have nothing against the alabasters.\u201d Obviously I\u2019m paraphrasing here, but I\u2019m pretty close. I had no reason not to believe her, but after reading your comments, I\u2019m beginning to suspect something is up with Yesha.\n\nI agree with runningnoodle\u2019s contention that Yesha\u2019s \u201cwillingness to conflate an image of the Confederate flag with \u2018racism\u2019\u201d is a little bit prejudiced. Yesha reached that spurious conclusion simply because she often sees the Ku Klux Klan waving the rebel flag during marches and skinheads proudly wearing it on their uniform. She refuses to factor in the possibility that people may use it to represent their heritage. Sure, it\u2019s a heritage of people who were willing to die so that slavery could endure, but why base her opinion on facts?\n\nThe man who designed the Confederate flag said that they were \u201cfighting to maintain the Heaven-ordained supremacy of the white man over the inferior or colored race; a white flag would thus be emblematical of our cause,\u201d but that is just another one of those \u201cfacts\u201d that Yesha factored in when she wrote about Keaton\u2019s mom. Facts are racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike when Meh1234 included the \u201cfact\u201d that police shoot black people because 13 percent of the population commits 50 percent of crimes, Meh1234 leaves out the fact that a large percentage of those crimes are drug-related arrests, and even though whites use drugs at about the same rate, blacks are 2.6 times more likely to be arrested for them. But who\u2019s counting? Obviously not Meh1234.\n\nI just want to confirm with all of you that I have notified the proper authorities and warned them that they should keep an eye on Yesha\u2019s black identity extremism. After they laughed me off the phone, I decided to keep a dossier myself. I\u2019m updating it every day, since no one else will.\n\nDespite the fact that Yesha has never killed a black boy in cold blood and walked away scot-free; even though she has never denied anyone employment or housing because of their race; in spite of the fact that she didn\u2019t create an unequal education, political or criminal-justice system, the fact that she wrote about a white woman who is willing to take handouts on the internet while vilifying black people just because it\u2019s actually her job to do that is no excuse. Yesha and her highfalutin words are the real racists. I see it now. Thanks, guys.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as for Yesha sullying innocent little Keaton, you are absolutely correct. Just because his mother is a racist and his father is a white supremacist doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Keaton will ... wait. Scratch that last point. I was about to use facts.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m watching her.\n\n[Also, I\u2019m not racist. I have white friends. I\u2019ve provided photographic evidence below.

You are a pussy!! South Carolina , what a joke and yes us northerners make fun of people taking pics of snow dusting. What a clown!! Your nostrils stretch out to the center of your eyes. Not natural!! Plantation nigger, no doubt. That is right motherfucker, we never owned slaves. Totally different generation. A bunch of excuse makers who blame others for their races dysfunctions. Facts do not care about feelings asshole. You called Trump a racist but Obama gets a pass for having Al Sharpton as a close adviser and invited BLM to the White House. The double fucking standards.

It is like black people cant think with their ,and need the fake media to think for them. You are a sheep!!! So damn easily led.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear George,\n\nYou win. Your letter is unclapbackatable. You\u2019re right. Black fathers need to stop playing sperm donors. Black people need to get an education before having children. President Barack Obama invited Black Lives Matter to the White House. I don\u2019t have a mirror in front of me right now, but my nose might actually stretch to the center of my eyes.\n\nYou are correct. By your definition of racism, neither you nor Donald Trump is a racist. You win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Kevin G\n\nTo: The Root I have been reading Jalopnik and Gizmodo for years. Recently your other articles from Kinja assets have been showing titles linking to racist articles. \u201c10 types of useless white people\u201d \u201cWhite people need to be better people\u201d And many more. I know you don\u2019t care about my opinion as a white person, but if the race of these articles were switched to any other race, YOUR teams would be shouting racism. I\u2019m sure you do this to get clicks and views, but I will no longer read anything published by your media company and it\u2019s support of racism.

I had no idea we were assaulting your delicate sensibilities with our anti-white commentary. Trust me, we are ashamed of ourselves. In our Wednesday staff meeting, we often worry about the content of our site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe live with constant concern about the flimsiness of the one-ply, Dollar Tree toilet-paper thickness of white skin. But now we understand the one thing we overlooked and the reason we have received so many complaints:\n\nWhite people can\u2019t read.\n\nCaucasian illiteracy is a growing problem in America that The Root has vowed to eliminate. After seeing the grammar and spelling in our hate mail, we realize these aren\u2019t isolated incidents; it\u2019s a national crisis equal only to the opioid epidemic, Chicago gun violence and when retail employees don\u2019t listen to a white woman who was obviously \u201ctold by AppleCare ... \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow we understand that Caucasians can\u2019t quite read the posts we write about homophobia in the black community, crime and misogyny. Now we fully see that when we criticize women like Tomi Lahren, Taylor Swift and former Officer Betty Shelby, we\u2019re being racist. But when we condemn people like Omarosa, Chrisette Michele or Arizona Police Officer Philip \u201cMitch\u201d Brailsford, who shot Daniel Shaver in cold blood, apparently white people can\u2019t read those articles.\n\nWhen we called out Ray Rice for his anti-anthem stance, Lil Wayne for his anti-Black Lives Matter comments, Migos for homophobia, Steve Harvey for joking about the Flint, Mich., water crisis, Sheriff David Clarke for the murders in his prison or Ben Carson for his support of Donald Trump, our fairer-skinned brethren didn\u2019t quite have the requisite level of reading comprehension to enjoy those pieces. When I wrote about the culture of black male silence surrounding sexual assault, I should have done it phonetically. And apparently, Damon Young\u2019s viral piece \u201cStraight Black Men Are the White People of Black People\u201d was too filled with words for our white audience.\n\nWe\u2019re going to change this, Kevin. Not just for you but for all of our white audience that accuses us of racism. I know you must be correct in your assessment of The Root because if not, it could only mean that you are being willfully ignorant and would rather call us racists than admit that there is a possibility that you pay attention only to things that confirm your own biases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know you\u2019d never do that, Kevin.\n\nI just want you to stay.

It\u2019s not even their fault. It\u2019s society\u2019s fault. White women are the shit. Even a balloon-shaped Becky gets to be a trophy for\u2014if no one else\u2014a self-hating black man. Our last two first ladies have been an Ivy League-educated attorney and a plain-old skinny, generic, white mail-order bride Trump got from eBay. White women have it made.\n\nBut even though they don\u2019t have to adhere to the rules of society, they at least have to acknowledge the existence of the motherfucking language. The language of politics and democracy doesn\u2019t genuflect simply because you have an oatmeal-colored vagina.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I say, \u201cThe Atlanta Falcons blew a 23-point lead in the Super Bowl,\u201d the players who didn\u2019t get in the game never email me saying: \u201cI was on the bench. I didn\u2019t have anything to do with that.\u201d When Trump says he was \u201celected by the American people,\u201d he doesn\u2019t parse it by saying, \u201cThe less-than-half who voted for me.\u201d When people say Barack Obama \u201cwon the black vote,\u201d Omarosa, Ben Carson, and Diamond and Silk didn\u2019t raise their hands to object. That\u2019s not how teams work. That\u2019s not how democracy works. That\u2019s not how anything else works.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, let\u2019s say I agreed with your premise. Doesn\u2019t that make white women more complicit? Who should I absolve? The white women who would have voted for Hillary Clinton but stayed their asses home?\n\nWhite people voted for Trump. White women voted for Trump. You should be glad Stephen and I say \u201c53 percent of white women\u201d instead of calling them by the name I suggested:\n\n\u201cThose blood-sucking, privileged-assed, low-key-racist white heauxs.\u201d\n\nFrom: Dees Nuts\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: MLK to Black people The only White people MLK did not hate were the underage prostitute whores he would beat and torture fuck.

You have the title.\n\nI know I\u2019ve said this to others before, but you get the championship trophy as the most racist white person ever. I\u2019ve seen hate before, but ... damn. It\u2019s not even about how anyone could despise someone who fought for freedom or equality. I can even understand why you believe the bullshit put out by J. Edgar Hoover\u2019s FBI, whose stated goal was to discredit Martin Luther King Jr. What both shocks and intrigues me about your hate is this:\n\nY\u2019all already killed him.\n\nAnd you\u2019re still mad?\n\nEnjoy your trophy.\n\nThis next two are basically the same statement on the supremacy of white men. The first is a Twitter direct message and the next is an email.\n\n\n\nFrom: Joseph B. I DISAGREE WITH MICHAEL HARRIOT OF THE ROOT TOTALLY WHEN HE SAYS WHITE PEOPLE ARE NOT UNDER ATTACK\u2014 HE HAS DUMBED EVERTHING DOWN TO HIS MENTALLITY. THE STATISTICS HE CITES ARE OK FOR WHITES BUT THEY COULD BE TEN TIMES BETTER. WHITESCARE UNDER ATTACK BY THE WHOLE WORLD JUST FOR BEING WHITE. PEOPLE JUST CANNOT HANDLE ALL THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF WHITES IN EVERY FIELD AND THE WORLD IS EXTREMELY JEALOUS OF WHITE MEN AND WHITE WOMEN. WHITES ARE GETTING RAPED AND KILLED BY NON WHITES IN FAR GREATER RATES THAN VISA VERSA. THE WHITE CHRIATIAN IS UNDER ATTACK BY THE WHOLE WORLD. JESUS PREDICTED THIS WHEN HE SAID \u201cTHEY HATED ME AND THEY WILL HATE AND PERCECUTE YOU.\u201d ISLAM IS A GARBAGE SICK VILE RELIGION THAT HONORS A MURDERER AND PEDOPHILE MOHAMMED.

PEOPLE MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR SHORTCOMINGS AND PROBLEMS THEY CREATE AND NOT BLAME OTHER RACES FOR THEIR FAILURES. THE WHITE RACE HAS LITERALKY SAVED OVER ONE BILLUON LIVES BY THE HIGH TECH MEDICINE THEY HAVE DEVELOPED. NO OTHER PEOPLE ON EARTH GAVED SAVED SO MANY LUVES. THINK OF ALL THE MILLUONS OF DOSES OF LUFE SAVING MEDICINES WHITES HAVE GIVEN THE WHOLE WORLD AND SAVED HUNDREDSVOF MILLIONSOF LIVES. I REPEAT. NON WHITE MEN HAVE NOT DONE THIS YET. I HOPE THEY DO SOME DAY. EVERYONE NEEDS TO DO THEIR PART IN HELPING HUMANITY . BUT THUS FAR ONLY THE WHITE COUNTRIES ARE GENEROUS AND KNOW THE WAY OF GIVE NOT GET.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this:\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nFrom: Adolph Crackerjack\n\nSubject: The difference between white men and everyone else White men live their lives. They go about their business, and for the most part never consider their race. To a white man he is merely another human. I certainty never though much about race until I got tired of my people being denigrated at every turn. White people are the only race of people taught to hate and disrespect their own ancestors and history. But women, all women see life through the lens of being a women not a human. For black people everything centers around being black. Gays and lesbians build their entire existence around the fact they are homosexual. Muslims are completely consumed by Islam. Meanwhile, the white man is a blank slate navigating life based on logic and experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNah, the difference between white men and and everyone else is this:\n\nYou believe you get to control the world.\n\nThat\u2019s it. You think you can rape, kill, pillage, steal, colonize and enslave at your will. It is in your DNA. You are the scourge of the earth. You tortured my ancestors, raped Africa, committed genocide against the Jews, Native Americans, Haitians, every island in the Caribbean, the Aztecs, the Inca, the Aborigine and every native population on earth. You are the destruction of the planet. If the devil has a face, he is a white man. You will one day pay for your misdeeds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m just kidding.\n\nI know you two letter writers didn\u2019t do any of that, just like I know Joseph hasn\u2019t invented anything in his life. He doesn\u2019t even have the technical literacy to find the \u201ccaps lock\u201d key, so I know he\u2019s not creating anything in his garage, unless you count meth. I don\u2019t.\n\nMy point is that Joseph and Adolph don\u2019t get to live by two sets of rules. They don\u2019t get to enjoy the privilege of individuality by dissociating themselves from Nazis, domestic terrorists and white supremacists and then castigate others by lumping all other groups into a basket based on stereotypes. So I say this to all white people:\n\nPick one.\n\nEven though I am an educated black man with an IQ high enough to hit the \u201cshift\u201d key, I\u2019m fine with you thinking I might be a stupid gangbanger or a criminal. But if we are going to play that game, you have to admit your personal responsibility for every \u201cshithole\u201d around the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf I am to be a thug, then you have to admit that you are Adolf Hitler and the Ku Klux Klan. If an individual Muslim should automatically be assumed to be a terrorist, then I should assume that all white men are the same as the scum who dragged Emmett Till out of bed or slaughtered billions of babies around the world to make way for white rule.\n\nI\u2019m not accusing you, or any white person, of anything. I\u2019m just saying: If we are going to play the game, pick a set of rules so that I can know which game we are playing.\n\nAnd for God\u2019s sake, hit the goddamn \u201ccaps lock\u201d key!", "keywords": ["horribles", "clapback", "roots", "whites", "basket", "mailbag", "trump", "know", "women", "voted", "men", "black", "white", "im", "say"], "polarity": 0.0025409052312605736, "subjectivity": 0.3439361794437936},

I examine them for white tears, anger and racism and formulate a response in my head. Then I look at my computer and say:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do that shit in the morning.\u201d\n\nYes, I am a \u201clate motherfucker.\u201d\n\nI am one of the precious few people who have been endowed with the special gift of never being on time. I am always late. Late motherfuckers don\u2019t enjoy being late. Instead, we have a disability that prevents us from being on time, unlike some people who wake up at the crack of dawn and start working diligently. (I won\u2019t mention any names. Let\u2019s just say she might be a deputy managing editor at The Root.) I honestly think I should get disability and one of those parking decals so I can park up front and rush in.\n\nMy late-motherfucker-ness came in handy today because this was a slow week for hate mail. Then, at the last minute, it flooded in like white tears at a Black Lives Matter rally. I say all of this to ask a favor of the haters:\n\nCan you be a little more prompt?\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: For the record, I was up at 4 a.m. today and waited hours for this post ... because Negroes are always late. I thank my Irish side for never being a late Negro. \u2014Yesha]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs an example of how being a late motherfucker works, our first item is a comment from JC-Sean, who took umbrage with me calling Post Malone a \u201ccultural appropriator\u201d in a post from a few hours ago.\n\n\u201cCultural appropriation\u201d is the very definition of hypocrisy. Our society is a mixing pot of culture, meaning everyone from every background takes some aspects of another previous society and implements them to their needs. I needn\u2019t list off the dozens of things white culture has created that black culture has taken advantage of. If Post doesn\u2019t want to be known as a rapper and simply as a musician, who are you to question him? If society relies on pure feelings as it is, then what makes his claim unjustified in comparison?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear JC-Sean:\n\nI was all set to clap back at your white nonsense about cultural appropriation. It was going to be good, too. I was going to write how you, like many others who present this ignorant argument, have no idea what cultural appropriation actually means. I was going to explain to you like you are 5 years old how cultural appropriation has nothing to do with taking \u201caspects of another previous society\u201d and using them for one\u2019s needs.\n\nDamn, JC, I was going to roast your ass for being so dumb that you think using an art form, invention or technique created by another culture is \u201ccultural appropriation.\u201d My best line was going to be, \u201cNigga, I\u2019m not accusing every motherfucker who uses fire or a wheel of stealing from Cro-Magnon man!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen I was going to rip apart your kindergarten-slow-class-like logic by explaining that there is a difference between Eminem immersing himself in a culture, respecting it and contributing to the art form and Post Malone using the art form to make millions while simultaneously saying: \u201cDon\u2019t lump me in with those niggers. I\u2019m a musician, not a rapper.\u201d Then I was going to explain how he gets to dabble in the stereotype of hip-hop while enjoying the privilege of not having to deal with the consequences.\n\nMy only problem was, I needed an analogy to illustrate my argument. If only there were some incident that could show how Malone\u2019s whiteness means that he isn\u2019t treated like the black artists he emulates with his Caucasian step-and-fetch-it-ery. I desperately needed a way to prove that Malone gets to enjoy the societal privilege of being white and pocket the money from his pseudo-black stereotype. I must admit, JC, that I was stuck.\n\nAnd then this happened:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, that is Post Malone, on video in Las Vegas, the recent site of one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history, riding around with a machine gun mounted atop a truck.\n\nPost Malone is not in jail.\n\nPost Malone is still alive.\n\nShut the fuck up, JC.\n\nOur next clapback comes from an accident:\n\n\n\nYesterday, while searching for something on the internet, Producer Danielle Young discovered that there is a whole section of YouTube devoted to black conservatives clapping back at The Root.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are two of my favorites:\n\nAnd this dude, who calls himself \u201cUncle Hotep\u201d and spends a lot of time attacking black people in videos:\n\nI must be honest: I thoroughly enjoyed these niggas, in the same way people enjoy watching Bumfights and Jackass. I actually subscribed to their channels after watching a few of their videos because I sometimes need to remind myself what the opposite of \u201cself-aware\u201d is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext week, no one will be talking about the Erykah Badu article or that wig-wearing mop bucket who called April Ryan out of her name, and I can use these videos to help me become a better person.

They love poverty. They keep people addicted to crumbs without teaching/promoting how to be independently successful and self reliant. They love when writers like you promulgate victim hood because it keeps people victims. When the black Fordham law professor wtites an article saying black people are disabled(link below), they cheer. If a person is disabled or a victim, they need help. So yeah, they\u2019ll keep giving those crumbs to the victims....in exchange for votes. They won\u2019t tell the victims they can succeed through hard work and making good decisions.(see Asian and black immigrants) Then they wouldn\u2019t need the Democrat\u2019s loving help. It\u2019s ethereal whiteness that\u2019s holding people back. Hmm, something that can\u2019t be quantified so can never be proven to be ended. That\u2019s the perfect boogeyman to keep people addicted to oppression. Maybe this is your wakeup call. I hope you\u2019re not as stupid as you are racist. Sincerely, Dj\n\nDearest Dj:\n\nFirst, I\u2019d like to thank you for recognizing both my stupidity and my racism and agreeing with me that the Democratic Party is trash. When I saw your link from the Fordham professor, I also agreed with you that it is a stupid idea to equate being black with being disabled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen I read the article from the link you sent from that bullshit right-wing site and the original article from Kimani Paul-Emile, who is an associate professor of law and director of Fordham University\u2019s Center on Race, Law, and Justice. After reading all of this, I sympathized with you because I quickly realized that one of my theories is correct:\n\nWhite people can\u2019t read.\n\nI realized this because Paul-Emile specifically wrote, \u201cBlackness, of course, is not, by itself, an impairment.\u201d Then I realized, after noting that the article explains that she is using the concept of disability law because \u201cit accurately reflects what Black, as a racial designation, is and was designed to be: disabling. Racial categories were created explicitly to serve as a caste system to privilege some and disadvantage others ... ,\u201d that you probably didn\u2019t read that part, because it is in the first sentence!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is what white people like you will do.\n\nYou plant the seeds of racism in every square inch of fertile soil, and when the poisonous flowers bloom, you wonder why we\u2019re sick. You accuse people of acting like victims because they\u2019re allergic to hate.\n\nI have seen the rape, oppression, torture, thievery and hate you spread around the world. You are a scourge of humanity, Dj. You are a monster. No one is afraid of \u201cboogeymen.\u201d But to quote Kevin Spacey from the great documentary The Usual Suspects:\n\n\u201cThe greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis second greatest?\n\nCreating Dj.", "keywords": ["clapback", "roots", "article", "appropriation", "mailbag", "going", "late", "art", "post", "culture", "black", "white", "cultural", "lastminute", "malone"], "polarity": 0.027621882086167802, "subjectivity": 0.4252031368102795},

Your claims have been overlooked for too long. They make movies about make-believe stuff like Santa Claus, Bigfoot and Caucasians who can dance, but never took the time to address your fairy tale of reverse racism. Hell, they even made a TV show about the Great Pumpkin and a movie about a sexy rabbit, but nothing about racist writers! How could this be?\n\nWell, today we are going to address the systematic inequality directed at white people. Because black people don\u2019t control Congress, the Senate, every state legislature, the U.S. economy and the media like white people do, dedicating this\u2014our weekly look back at the emails, direct messages and tweets we receive\u2014to the topic is the best we can do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t say we didn\u2019t try.\n\nThis first tweet and email go hand in hand:\n\n\n\nFrom: J.M. and Tucker.\n\nTo: Danielle Belton\n\nSubject: Racism is evil, regardless of the source Ms. Belton, Instead of blaming \u201cwhite people (not a race by the way)\u201d for all the problems in the black community, why don\u2019t you offer some tough love to your fellow blacks? How about stay in school, don\u2019t have sex and get pregnant outside of marriage and obey the law. Or, take responsibility for your own actions, respect authority and work hard. I\u2019m sure there are black parents who are out there who are responsible and raise children who are responsible and positive contributors to society. However, there are a large percentage who do not. My parents and sisters came here from Italy with little more than the clothes on their backs. No one handed them a \u201cwhite privilege card\u201d. They worked hard, saved money and did the best they could for my family. My advice to black people is stop being blinded by a desire for vengeance against \u201cwhite people\u201d and work hard to be prosperous. As they say, \u201cliving well is the best revenge\u201d\n\nDear Bill, J.M. and Tucker:\n\nAs one of Ms. Belton\u2019s \u201cfellow blacks,\u201d I can attest to the fact that she comes to every one of the Global Organizations Dedicated to the Descendants of Africans, Moor and Negroes (GODDAMN) monthly meetings and tells the young kids to stay in school, use condoms and obey the law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe younger \u201cfellow blacks\u201d just won\u2019t listen. You know how they are. Either they are too stupid to know what Danielle is telling them (you know they have lower IQs), or it might have something to do with the fact that unwed motherhood, the dropout rate and crime are all socioeconomic phenomena, and\u2014stripped of race\u2014poor whites have the same crime rate, teenage pregnancy rate and dropout rate. Danielle probably thinks the question should be, \u201cWhy is the black poverty rate so much higher?\u201d But you\u2019re right, J.M. It\u2019s probably because she doesn\u2019t scold her \u201cfellow blacks\u201d enough.\n\nCongratulations on the success of your cousins who moved here from Italy. I\u2019m sure it was difficult for them to succeed, given the fact that Giuseppe Crow Laws were just wiped off the books 50 years ago and the people in power now were the same people in power when this country was still lynching Italians for looking white people in the eye and they could only attend historically Italian colleges, universities and public schools. I\u2019m sure your cousins simply forgot the 250 years when black people couldn\u2019t\u2014as Tucker said\u2014go to the polls when we wanted higher wages, dignified jobs and \u201cleadership that promised to put [all] Americans first, above any foreign nation or domestic interest group.\u201d I guess black people didn\u2019t need that solution to their problems.\n\nHowever, you were right when you said, \u201cLiving well is the best revenge.\u201d That is true. I just wish people like you didn\u2019t build such a high barrier to \u201cliving well\u201d and then act as if we could eliminate the obstacle by telling our kids to \u201cjust climb higher\u201d and pretend like the wall was not there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think you should consider this: Saying \u201cFuck the people who built and maintain this wall\u201d and making fun of the wall builders isn\u2019t racist. It\u2019s just a tiny, microscopic form of \u201cliving well.\u201d\n\nThanks, J.M.\n\nA Twitter direct message from xxneverdasamexx:\n\nI just read your piece about Tucker and when they asked you on his show on fox news. You want to stand on your soap box, make fun of and judge white people because they\u2019re racists? And you think it makes all the racist and bigoted stuff you write about whites ok? And your comment about the quote \u201cthrow a rock into a pack of dogs...\u201d I think that actually applies to you...Tucker called you out and the Root for being racists against whites, now your own logic and using the dog quote, amounts to that of it doesn\u2019t apply, the person will let it fly...but you didnt let it fly, you started yelling like the hit dog. You and the Root are obviously racists against whites. Now, let\u2019s take some of what you wrote about white people and said about white people...you don\u2019t think it makes you racist or that you are racist. But let\u2019s say I wrote everything you wrote, the exact same way, same words..exactly the same..but instead of white, I used black...you would label me a racist white supremacist nazi KKK pos...and you want to talk about how whites shoot up schools and wherever else you said whites do...how about I\u2019m tired of all the dumb blacks who sell heroin and crack all over my city.. how about I\u2019m tired of the dumb blacks who run around in groups, in my city, jumping and beating white people who are alone for no other reason then their white...and you\u2019re the worst type, becuase you\u2019re such a hypocrite that wants to cry and yell that whites are racist, when you spew nothing but racism. The person who see race and racism is everything, is the REAL racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Sir:\n\nYou\u2019re right, The Root shouldn\u2019t make fun of white people. We had no idea you were this fragile, and apologize for all the white tears we caused.\n\nYou are correct that if white people wrote an article making fun of black people the way I and others at The Root make fun of white people, we\u2019d call them racist. But it wouldn\u2019t be because of what you wrote or said. We would object to what you said because it is offensive in combination with how you actually treat black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wanted to clap back at you by saying that unlike your frail, delicate, unseasoned, sallow spirits, black people wouldn\u2019t give a damn what you called us if you treated us equally. But I didn\u2019t want to speak on behalf of everyone at The Root, so I posed this question to the entire staff this morning:\n\nSuppose you were the leader of all the black people in America and you were approached by the leader of all white people [I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s Donald Trump or Taylor Swift] with this proposition: White people could magically erase all inequality, racism, hate, transphobia, homophobia, etc., in the world, but black people would have to agree to one thing: White people would get to address us only as \u201cniggers.\u201d ... Would you accept?\n\nSome immediately agreed to the proposition. Some wondered how we would enforce the agreement, while others didn\u2019t think it would ever work. There was a fierce debate going on until Editor-in-Chief Danielle Belton came in and broke up the conversation and made us get back to work. (And yes, J.M., as we dispersed, she yelled, \u201cMake sure you don\u2019t get pregnant or rob anyone today!\u201d See ... she\u2019s doing her part.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here is my point: Every single person considered it because we don\u2019t give a damn what you call us if you treat us equally! White people are more hurt about some motherfucking articles on a motherfucking website than they are about actual inequality! If that was the only racism black people had to face, we would rejoice.\n\nSo if you only wrote articles about the \u201cdumb blacks\u201d in your city selling heroin (I\u2019m sure it got there on all those black-owned boats and planes) or only wrote about the \u201cdumb blacks\u201d who go around attacking whites, but you eliminated every other form of discrimination and hate, we wouldn\u2019t call you a \u201cracist white supremacist nazi, KKK\u201d piece of shit ...\n\nJust a \u201cpiece of shit.\u201d\n\nFinally, a Twitter direct message:\n\nFrom: Mike Jones\n\nTo: Michael Harriot How does it feel to be one of the biggest racists in America?\n\nI\u2019d like to accept this award on behalf of all the black people who tried their hardest to win this title by simply talking about race. I\u2019d also like to thank some of the past winners, including the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Malcolm X and President Barack Obama, who were all called racists and accused of dividing the country by bringing up the subject of race.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most of all, I\u2019d like to thank my fellow nominees for this year.\n\nTo the white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va.: I know you thought you had it in the bag this year. But just because you brought together every different kind of racist to terrorize a city doesn\u2019t mean you deserve this award. I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cBut we actually killed someone, and Michael Harriot and the staff of The Root have never laid hands on another human being because of their race.\u201d Look, man, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. You just have to work harder next year. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll think of something.\n\nTo Donald Trump: I know you\u2019re over there talking to the panel trying to convince them that there must have been some illegal voting, but let it go. Can\u2019t you see it? We\u2019re more racist than you are. You tried to ban Muslims from entering the country, painted Mexicans as rapists and murderers, and put known white supremacists in your Cabinet. But did you create the term \u201cwypipo\u201d? Did you make jokes about potato salad? No, but we did. Let this be a lesson to you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut let me tell you what makes us the proudest.\n\nIn 1983 Timothy Coggins was seen dancing with a white woman at the People\u2019s Choice nightclub in Griffin, Ga. A few white men got together and kidnapped Coggins. Two of the kidnappers were law enforcement officers. Then they beat him. Then they wrapped a chain around his neck and dragged him for over a mile. But he was still alive.\n\nSo the white men took a knife and stabbed him. They sliced him. They slit him. They took turns. When one of them was too tired, the next man would take over. Then they tied him to a truck again, dragged him a little while longer, then threw him in a ditch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEveryone in town knew who did it because they bragged about the time they killed a nigger and got away with it. One of the killers said he \u201cmissed the good old days when you could kill a black man for no reason.\u201d Another one of them told his wife, \u201cIf you keep on, you\u2019re going to wind up like that nigger in the ditch.\u201d\n\nBut no one told on these men for 34 years. The ones who kept quiet were complicit in the Coggins family\u2019s unending grief. Silence is the most despicable kind of racism there is. I wonder who Coggins\u2019 loved ones hate more: the men who killed Coggins that night, or the ones who knew but didn\u2019t give a damn about their pain and suffering?\n\nBut today I stand before you to tell you that Mike Jones, Tucker Carlson and Fox News viewers everywhere have declared that I and the rest of The Root staff, by poking fun at the flimsy, snowflakelike, thin, pearl skin of America\u2019s ruling class, are more racist than Bill Moore Sr. and Frankie Gebhardt, who allegedly killed Timothy Coggins and left him dying in a ditch, and all the white people who kept the terrible secret for 34 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThank you.", "keywords": ["clapback", "roots", "blacks", "racism", "ok", "racist", "whites", "wrote", "mailbag", "sure", "butthurt", "root", "black", "white", "im"], "polarity": 0.03796901304713804, "subjectivity": 0.39948504764911},

It might help you understand why The Root started this weekly tradition.

I quickly quipped, \u201cThat nigga Jamaal be tripping,\u201d and everyone burst into laughter.\n\nJamaal got in my face and kindly informed me that he was going to kick my ass.

Jamaal is pretty big.\u201d\n\nThe next day, no one remembered me running home like a scared rat, but they remembered that joke I said about Jamaal.

Blame Yesha.\n\n[Thank you; that was a good fable/introduction. \u2014Yesha]\n\nThe following is a direct message from a Twitter user named P0lymorphic:\n\n\n\nFrom: P0lymorphic\n\nTo: Michael Harriot You are aware hate crimes apply to all people. Not just people of color. https://www.theroot.com/when-the-irish-weren-t-white-1793358754 \u2026 this article is offensive, remove it or I\u2019ll call your local pd and file a complaint for hate crimes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear P0lymorphic,\n\nI rarely do this, but I am reaching out to you because I am confused. A few weeks ago we published an article about Nazi furries that engendered a furtwa against me. Every day since, I have received hate mail from people who like to dress up as magenta German shepherds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can see that your Twitter bio picture is some kind of animal in a Nazi uniform. Because of the past few weeks, that\u2019s not so weird. The crazy part is this: In your direct message accusing me of a \u201chate crime,\u201d you never mentioned furries, the alt-right furry article or anything about your polymorphism!\n\nThis leaves me with some questions for you, P0lymorphic. I hope you can provide some clear answers:\n\n\n\nWhy are you dressed up like an alt-right golden retriever? Look, I get it, we all have our preferences. I am not a human supremacist. I feel like blacks, whites, Hispanics, Asians and people who want to walk around like the love child of Sonic the Hedgehog and a Teletubbie all deserve the same rights. What puzzles me is why you want to marginalize others. Who are you specifically against? Black bears? Do you want to build a wall to keep out the chihuahuas coming here to take your furry jobs? Are you Homo (sapiens) phobic?\n\nAre you Irish? The link you provided is to an article about the false notion that the Irish were slaves. Was that a mistake, or are you willing to forgive me for making fun of your predilection for polymorphism, but the fact that I wrote about the Irish upsets you? What are you going to tell the police? When they come to your home to answer the complaint, will you be wearing your SS-officer fox outfit? Are you going to ... wait. I think I just figured it out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know what\u2019s going on. You\u2019re trying to fuck a police dog, aren\u2019t you, P0lymorphic? You\u2019re using my splendid name to lure an unsuspecting K-9 officer to your home so you can make sweet love to another animal in uniform.\n\nI refuse to be a part of your sick games, P0lymorphic. I see through your little ruse. Shame on you!\n\nThe next message is from the comment section for Monique Judge\u2019s article about why emotional maturity and emotional intelligence are important in healthy relationships:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear AluNoir:\n\nMonique\u2019s definitions of emotional intelligence and emotional maturity come directly from psychological definitions, specifically, Psychology Today. But it brings up a greater point about a subject we need to discuss: I don\u2019t think you\u2019re very emotionally intelligent or mature, AluNoir. I have never met you personally, so I am basing my conjecture on one theory:\n\nHit dogs.\n\nThere is an old Southern saying that goes, \u201cA hit dog will holler,\u201d meaning that when you say or do something to a group of people, the one who is offended will let it be known. This happens often at The Root. Allow me to present you with another recent example:\n\nThis week I wrote this article:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could easily find 10 comments that objected to the article, but I think the easiest way would be to just post this letter (that\u2019s right, you are about to see a clapback inside a clapback. That\u2019s some Inception-level shit):\n\nFrom: Kristi Z\n\nTo: Michael Harriot Michael, it\u2019s hard to understand how you could write an article about Trump calling Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas being racist and then call all white women Beckies. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s just as bad? Using your logic, if Trump using a traditional native American name as a slur means he hates Indians, does this means you hate all women? I can tell youdo but I want to hear you say it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAluNoir, Kristi is a Becky.\n\nShe makes a good point that, all things being equal, calling a woman \u201cPocahontas\u201d is the same as calling a white woman a \u201cBecky.\u201d But here is the thing\u2014and I\u2019m going to type it in all caps, which, in internet parlance, means I am yelling. Because I am about to yell:\n\nALL THINGS ARE NOT EQUAL!\n\nThat is the entire point of the term \u201cBecky.\u201d That is the entire point of the term \u201cwypipo.\u201d If the infinitely small dig of \u201cBecky\u201d and \u201cwypipo\u201d upsets you, then imagine how white supremacy must feel. Imagine how being labeled a \u201cthug\u201d feels. Or \u201cunderprivileged.\u201d Or \u201curban.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most important (here is where I tie the point up in a neat little bow), anyone who objects to the the truth of a psychological definition or a hackneyed joke of a quiz is probably a hit dog.\n\nAluNoir thinks that Monique must be living in an alternate reality because she believes in psychology. AluNoir believes that anyone who uses the actual definition of a term is delusional. AluNoir is emotionally unintelligent and emotionally immature. Alu Noir is a hit dog.\n\nJust like Kristi. Kristi literally believes that anyone who makes a joke about white women must obviously hate all women. According to Kristi, that is the only possible explanation. I mean ... who could possibly dislike white women, with their entitled attitudes and their credit-card-shaped buttocks?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy Kristi\u2019s standards, either I\u2019m a hater or there are people on this earth who actually believe that there are some white women whose entire existence is predicated on their privilege. Kristi can\u2019t fathom that it could possibly be the former, so it must be the latter. Kristi is a hit dog. Kristi is a Becky.\n\nI beg of you, AuNoir ...\n\nDon\u2019t be like Kristi.\n\nThe next letter is an email to one of our female writers. I have concealed her name in case there are others out there like this:\n\n\n\nFrom: Ron E.\n\nSubject: Your worn panties Would it be possible for you to sell me your worn panties? Please let me know.\n\nThank you kindly. XOXOX Ron\n\nDear Ron,\n\nFirst of all, I am jealous. I have been writing for The Root for quite a while and no one has solicited a pair of my boxers. Even though I am disappointed, I will let it go so that I can bring up another salient point:\n\nWhy, though?\n\nWhy do you want a pair of panties? More important, what endows you with the confidence to ask?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have often wondered how men like Louis C.K., Harvey Weinstein and Mark Halperin would think that a woman would want to see them masturbate. How could they pose questions like, \u201cYou wanna see me wash my bloated, fluorescent dad bod in the shower or watch me manhandle my penis like a bicycle pump?\u201d I have come up with a theory:\n\nIt works.\n\nI can\u2019t believe that these middle-aged men would continue to ask women these obscene questions if no one, at some point, said yes. Human nature doesn\u2019t work that way. Therefore, I have come up with a solution I call the \u201cThanksgiving rule.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you are a man, every Thanksgiving, you should gather your aunts, sisters, mother and grandmother in a room and reveal your sexual proclivities. Tell them, \u201cI\u2019m trying to find a woman who likes when a man grabs her breasts without asking.\u201d Ask them if they know a nice girl at their church who might be looking for a guy to furiously masturbate into their house plant.\n\nIf they look disgusted or throw mashed potatoes in your face, take that as a sign that you shouldn\u2019t do it to strangers. If you can\u2019t do it at home, don\u2019t do it in public.\n\nI think I just solved the entire sexual-misconduct crisis.

If Alabama\u2019s Senate seat switches parties, that will effectively give the GOP a slim one-vote margin in the nation\u2019s highest legislative chamber. Sen. John McCain\u2019s last-minute return to the Senate to doom the American Health Care Act demonstrated how fragile the margin is because convincing two Republicans to defect from the party line is much easier than it is to convince three.\n\nFor these reasons, and the fact that\u2014with Donald Trump and Al Franken still in our nation\u2019s capital\u2014Roy Moore could push Washington, D.C.\u2019s per capita vagina-grabbing numbers over the legal limit, there are four things you should know about why it is important that Alabama selects Doug Jones over the allegedly child-molesting constitutional cowboy.\n\n1. It is all about the SCOTUS, baby: Much has been said about Roy Moore\u2019s love for tenth-graders and Doug Jones\u2019 prosecution of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombers. But this election will affect a bigger dream of Republicans across the country: the opportunity to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn April, Republicans changed the Senate rules to allow a simple majority instead of 60 votes to confirm U.S. Supreme Court nominees. This \u201cnuclear option\u201d means that the minority party can\u2019t reject a nominee unless it convinces at least three Republicans to join its dissent. It is much easier to convince two Republicans than three.\n\n\n\nMany of Alabama\u2019s Republicans claim to find Moore despicable, but they are willing to cast a vote for him because they desperately want to outlaw abortion. Now, Republican senators know that Roe v. Wade will probably never be overturned, but the ability to appoint a conservative justice could affect their stranglehold on power. The court will soon hear two cases about the legality of political gerrymandering, a ruling that will affect how party lines are drawn nationwide.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. White Jesus vs. Black Jesus: This is an existential battle of White Jesus vs. Black Jesus. Die-hard Republicans in Alabama actually believe that God wants Moore to go to Washington to save their country. Apparently, Moore is teaming up with Jesus Chadwick Christ to make the Ten Commandments law, cure homosexuality and stop the \u201cgay agenda\u201d from turning our boys transgender by rubbing up against them in bathrooms.\n\nBlack Jesus, on the other hand, simply hates when people use his name in vain. Oh ... and the whole molestation thing.\n\nBlack Jesus hates that, too.\n\n3. 2018 elections: The GOP stands to lose a few seats in next year\u2019s elections because of the dumpster fire that is the Trump administration. The only way Republicans could possibly save themselves is to pass legislation that appeals to their current base, and one less Republican senator makes that increasingly difficult.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoy Moore is basically a hillbilly version of Donald Trump. His presence in the Senate would mean that the White House would have another advocate in the Senate to push Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant agenda, Mike Pence\u2019s religious freedom wet dreams and Jeff Sessions\u2019 history of disenfranchising voters.\n\n\n\n4. The first \u201calt-right\u201d senator: There are Roy Moore-like politicians in the House of Representatives, like Steve King (R-Iowa) and Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), but senators tend to be more moderate because they have to rally the support of their respective state. Moore would be the first senator backed by Steve Bannon, effectively giving legitimacy to the perception that the alt-right whisperer is the next kingmaker of the Republican Party.\n\nIf Moore wins, it will send a signal to Republicans that the Trump-Bannon base of their party has enough political clout to get them elected, and that could likely shift Republican ideology further right. I know that doesn\u2019t seem possible, but when you hear about bills outlawing Shariah law, speaking \u201cMexican,\u201d sex in any position other than missionary and the White Lives Matter Protection Act of 2018, just remember I told you so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI will be updating this post throughout the evening, so check in with us for results, on-the-ground coverage and intermittent hymns begging Black Jesus, the voting gods and Beyonc\u00e9 for grace, mercy and non-pedophile-related blessings.", "keywords": ["live", "blog", "party", "prayer", "jones", "jesus", "doug", "trump", "senate", "alabama", "moore", "race", "republicans", "republican", "white", "circle", "noholdsbarred"], "polarity": 0.029985119047619056, "subjectivity": 0.4057622354497354},

Monique Judge for the record, Black Men have consistently explained the Gay Agenda, and if you like we can have a discussion about it. You and the other coon, Michael Harriot at root.com need to fall back from attacking Confident heterosexual Black Men. Before you call me a Hotep, save it for the person that fit the description. I am a Humanistic Atheist, I don\u2019t give a damn about any form of religion or Spirituality or the dumb Woke shit. The Gay Agenda is just as real as your hate for confident heterosexual Black Men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear IsAllah Self-Kingdom,\n\nFirst, I\u2019d like to congratulate you. Since I\u2019ve been a full-time employee at The Root, we have been arguing about the Hotepest name ever, and you win hands down. While I\u2019m sure you are a fine, upstanding citizen, your name has obviously done a nine-year bid in prison, where it converted to Islam. I bet your name wears a kufi, refers to pork as \u201cswine\u201d and fucks heavyset white girls on the low. I bet your real name is something like Parker Willoughby.\n\nSetting aside the Hotepery that is your name, I want to offer my sincerest condolences, because I know your secret:\n\nYou have a tiny penis, don\u2019t you, IsAllah?\n\nDon\u2019t be ashamed. It happens. That\u2019s probably why you don\u2019t believe in God, and I don\u2019t blame you. What kind of god would allow his people to be tortured and oppressed for 400 years and then give one of his children a pinkie-toe-sized penis?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though I don\u2019t know you, I know men like you. I know men who boast about being \u201cconfident black men,\u201d but in real life, they suffer from the perpetual anger of erectile dysfunction because they can\u2019t get a spoonful of blood to flow into their thimblelike phallus. I recognized your inadequacy because your attitude resembles that of a very stupid white supremacist who claims to be \u201cthe least racist person\u201d we\u2019ll ever meet. He claims to be very smart and says he went to the best schools. I won\u2019t embarrass him by calling his name, except to say that he is a \u201cvery stable genius,\u201d just like you are a \u201cconfident, heterosexual black man\u201d who doesn\u2019t believe in God or religion but calls himself \u201cIsAllah.\u201d\n\nEarlier today, Monique Judge was giggling at guys who talk about the \u201cgay agenda.\u201d Trust me, I don\u2019t giggle. The white man makes us believe that giggling is masculine, but I overstand because I use my fourth eye. Not my third eye, because the number 3 is a relic of Christian slavery from the Holy Trinity, the three wise men and the three blind mice. (Also, my third eye is what I call my penis.)\n\nApparently, you and others live in constant fear that \u201chomosexuals\u201d have a secret plan that could convince you to eat swine and engage in same-sex shenanigans. Don\u2019t fall prey to the gay agenda. I can tell you are a weak-minded individual worried about the prospect that acknowledging the humanity of people whose love looks different from yours could magically render you semen-thirsty. Resist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStay strong, IsAllah.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA coon.\n\nThe next clapback stems from an article at HuffPost by Dwayne Wong (Omowale) entitled \u201cStop Using Hotep as an Insult.\u201d In it, Wong says:\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, hotep is an ancient Egyptian term that means \u201cto be at peace.\u201d This is why it\u2019s distressing to me when I see people trying to use hotep as an insult\u2014some of the writers at the Root are especially at fault for helping degrade the term hotep. These people either do not know what the term means or they know and are deliberately trying to demean African history and culture. The term has been coming up a lot lately in regards to Umar Johnson. Umar has been in the headlines because he is currently under investigation and faces losing his psychology license. Umar has also been caught up in a feud with Tariq Nasheed, the director of the Hidden Colors series. Damon Young gave this definition of hotep: Over the past decade or so, the working definition of \u201cHotep\u201d has morphed into an all-encompassing term describing a person who\u2019s either a clueless parody of Afrocentricity\u2014think \u201cPreach\u201d from Don\u2019t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood\u2014or someone who\u2019s loudly, conspicuously and obnoxiously pro-black but anti-progress. As African people we have been subjected to having our history and culture degraded, distorted, and destroyed for centuries now. The people who have bastardized what hotep means are contributing to that problem. Take Michael Harriot, for example. Harriot is a writer at the Root and he is constantly using his platform there to criticize Umar Johnson. Some of these criticisms have merit, but other times they have gone so far that Harriot himself has had to apologize and admit he was wrong. In his latest article on Umar, Harriot ironically mocks Umar as being a \u201cHotepologist\u201d and miseducator, even though Harriot is operating as a miseducator himself by distorting what the term hotep means. Another article mocks the fight between Umar and Tariq as being \u201cThe Real Husbands of Hotep\u201d. Hotep means to be at peace, so how does that term fit in with the discord that we have seen being displayed between Umar and Tariq. When Umar and Seti had their feud in 2016, another writer at the Root described it as a \u201cHotep Hoedown\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Dwayne,\n\nFirst of all, I want to say: You are right.\n\nEven before I read your article, I had been conflicted about using the word \u201cHotep\u201d as a pejorative. I fully recognize the origin and the meaning of the word. As someone who came to The Root partly because of my blog NegusWhoRead [Editor\u2019s note: And because of me. \u2014Yesha], I realize the importance of taking back words that have been used against us. There is only one problem that I have:\n\nWhat will we call Hoteps?\n\nNeither Damon Young, I nor any other writer at The Root created the term \u201cHotep\u201d to describe the overly woke people who engage in misinformation and thievery against the black community. We use the word because people know what it means. But I readily admit that I fell into the trap of lazily throwing it at those who honestly seek liberation by connecting themselves with their ancestral heritage. While I do think that the default deification of everything Egyptian is problematic for a number of reasons, I recognize that \u201cHotep\u201d is a desperate clinging to a history that has been stripped away from our people by a long legacy of white supremacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTherefore, I promise that I will no longer use it in a derogatory manner. I do not speak for any other writer here, but I\u2019m going to do better. This pledge does, however, lead back to my original problem: What will we call Hoteps? (OK, that was the last time.) I have come up with a list:\n\nWhore-teps\n\n\n\nUmaricans\n\nPoor Tariq-ans\n\nAnkhologist\n\nQuack Lies Matter\n\nWokeheads\n\nNeo Not-Sees\n\nHidden Coloreds\n\nBlacksliders\n\nIsAllah Self Kingdom\n\nHopefully one of those will suffice.\n\nFrom: Justin Other Nigga\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: The Root is anti-black Hey faggot, How much do they pay you to keep bashing black men like Umar? How many people do you mentor? What are you doing for the black community? have you done anything other tna tear black men down? Why do you have so much hate for men like Umar?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Justin,\n\nLet me tell you a story.\n\nI grew up poor as fuck. Not underprivileged\u2014poor. Nights-without-electricity poor. Days-without-water poor. Cereal-and-water-for-dinner poor. I lived in a very religious household and was homeschooled until I was 12.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy first year attending school, I was excited to experience many of the things most people take for granted. I remember how incredibly pumped I was for picture day at school. When that day came, each student was supposed to bring $10 to have his or her picture taken. The night before picture day, my mother informed my sisters and me that she only had $30\u2014not enough for pictures for my three sisters and me. As the only boy in the house, I told her to let my sisters take their pictures. I was heartbroken, but I was over it by the next morning.\n\nThen a miracle happened.\n\nI swear on everything that is good and true that I exited the house on the morning of picture day, and lying on the ground was a $10 bill! I could have taken that money and had my picture taken, but I knew that the reason I couldn\u2019t take pictures was that my mother had to be dead broke. She was in her last week of college and wasn\u2019t working, so I gave her the money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was a Friday. The next day at church (we attended church on Saturdays), I watched my mother put $10 in the offering plate. I still believe that my mother put that money in the offering because she thought she was \u201csowing a seed.\u201d That\u2019s how blind, desperate faith works.\n\nAfter service that night, everyone gathered around in the church parking lot to gaze at the pastor\u2019s shiny new car. (It was a shitty Chrysler New Yorker, but to me, it was a might as well have been a Maserati.)\n\nFuck Umar Johnson and all the thieving motherfuckers sucking the souls and money from anyone hoping to sow a seed for black people because we are desperate for something ... anything. I hope they die a fiery death in the depths of hell. I want my foot to be the one that kicks them over the edge. They are worse than white supremacists. I\u2019d rather have a cross on my lawn than a hand in my pocket.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root is not making me rich. When I heard about Johnson\u2019s hearing, I was going to go whether The Root sent me or not. I had planned on paying my own way the same as I had done when I went to Ferguson, Mo.; Baltimore; Jena, Texas; and Sanford, Fla. I didn\u2019t ask a black person for a dime to go to any of those places.\n\nYes, I am a hater. I hate con men. The $10 I found on my way to school did as much good for people as the $400,000 raised by Johnson. He has never produced a business plan, budget or shred of evidence that he is starting a school. If he can prove where the money he collected went, I will take back every word I\u2019ve ever said about him. I\u2019ve done it before. I am not happy he is defrauding people who want a school for black boys. I want one, too.\n\nAs long as I have fingers to type and a platform, I will never leave him alone. So call me a faggot. I could care less about what you\u2014wait ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\n...

But because of my dedication to the readers of The Root, I crawled out of bed to respond to a few emails, tweets, comments and direct messages we receive during the week. (And because, when I told my editor, Yesha Callahan, about my sickness, she sympathetically said, \u201cSooo ... you gonna do the mailbag or nah?\u201d)\n\nIf the flu kills me and I die at this keyboard, know that I made this sacrifice for you. Tell my grandchildren about how I used to clap back. Avenge my death!

Remember I loved you all!*\n\n* (Unless Yesha\u2019s reading this.)\n\nThis first item is meant to address one of the most frequent complaints received by The Root. I have been emailed by numerous white women arguing the same point, which is the most white-womanish point ever:\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nFrom L. Greenbow\n\nSubject: Your hate for white women I am numb to your treatment of white women because you want to throw stones at them so much that people don\u2019t pay attention to it anymore. What bothers me it when you keep pushing the narrative that 53% of white women voted for Trump. That is not the case. 53% of white women voters voted for Trump. Most white women did not vote for him because only a small porecetage one the population votes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd here is another comment from a reader named \u201cGet some Dak Sausage,\u201d who posted about it multiple times in a post that had nothing to do with Donald Trump, white women or even politics. They complained about Senior Editor Stephen Crockett\u2019s use of the stat in several comments:\n\nYes. I\u2019m saying that factually roughly 25% of white women voted for Trump. That\u2019s a fact. I\u2019m not talking about how complicit everyone feels the roughly half of white women that didn\u2019t vote are.\n\nDear L and Get:\n\nI apologize sincerely from the bottom of my heart. When I wrote that 53 percent of white women voted for Trump, I made a mistake. In my haste to be accurate and fair, I may have sullied the good name of the Caucasian sheroes who historically get to benefit from the conquering, colonizing white supremacist manifest destiny embedded in their male counterparts without bloodying their hands or mussing their silky blond hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI meant \u201cwhite women.\u201d\n\nI know that white women enjoy an unparalleled entitlement gifted to them at birth that follows them around for their entire lives. It\u2019s not even their fault. It\u2019s society\u2019s fault. White women are the shit. Even a balloon-shaped Becky gets to be a trophy for\u2014if no one else\u2014a self-hating black man. Our last two first ladies have been an Ivy League-educated attorney and a plain-old skinny, generic, white mail-order bride Trump got from eBay. White women have it made.\n\nBut even though they don\u2019t have to adhere to the rules of society, they at least have to acknowledge the existence of the motherfucking language. The language of politics and democracy doesn\u2019t genuflect simply because you have an oatmeal-colored vagina.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I say, \u201cThe Atlanta Falcons blew a 23-point lead in the Super Bowl,\u201d the players who didn\u2019t get in the game never email me saying: \u201cI was on the bench. I didn\u2019t have anything to do with that.\u201d When Trump says he was \u201celected by the American people,\u201d he doesn\u2019t parse it by saying, \u201cThe less-than-half who voted for me.\u201d When people say Barack Obama \u201cwon the black vote,\u201d Omarosa, Ben Carson, and Diamond and Silk didn\u2019t raise their hands to object. That\u2019s not how teams work. That\u2019s not how democracy works. That\u2019s not how anything else works.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, let\u2019s say I agreed with your premise. Doesn\u2019t that make white women more complicit? Who should I absolve? The white women who would have voted for Hillary Clinton but stayed their asses home?\n\nWhite people voted for Trump. White women voted for Trump. You should be glad Stephen and I say \u201c53 percent of white women\u201d instead of calling them by the name I suggested:\n\n\u201cThose blood-sucking, privileged-assed, low-key-racist white heauxs.\u201d\n\nFrom: Dees Nuts\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: MLK to Black people The only White people MLK did not hate were the underage prostitute whores he would beat and torture fuck. He\u2019s no hero. Can\u2019t wait for the files to come out about your scumbag hero. He was a complete degenerate. Get woke about MLK, clown shoes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Dees,\n\nYou win. You have the title.\n\nI know I\u2019ve said this to others before, but you get the championship trophy as the most racist white person ever. I\u2019ve seen hate before, but ... damn. It\u2019s not even about how anyone could despise someone who fought for freedom or equality. I can even understand why you believe the bullshit put out by J. Edgar Hoover\u2019s FBI, whose stated goal was to discredit Martin Luther King Jr. What both shocks and intrigues me about your hate is this:\n\nY\u2019all already killed him.\n\nAnd you\u2019re still mad?\n\nEnjoy your trophy.\n\nThis next two are basically the same statement on the supremacy of white men. The first is a Twitter direct message and the next is an email.\n\n\n\nFrom: Joseph B. I DISAGREE WITH MICHAEL HARRIOT OF THE ROOT TOTALLY WHEN HE SAYS WHITE PEOPLE ARE NOT UNDER ATTACK\u2014 HE HAS DUMBED EVERTHING DOWN TO HIS MENTALLITY. THE STATISTICS HE CITES ARE OK FOR WHITES BUT THEY COULD BE TEN TIMES BETTER. WHITESCARE UNDER ATTACK BY THE WHOLE WORLD JUST FOR BEING WHITE. PEOPLE JUST CANNOT HANDLE ALL THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF WHITES IN EVERY FIELD AND THE WORLD IS EXTREMELY JEALOUS OF WHITE MEN AND WHITE WOMEN. WHITES ARE GETTING RAPED AND KILLED BY NON WHITES IN FAR GREATER RATES THAN VISA VERSA. THE WHITE CHRIATIAN IS UNDER ATTACK BY THE WHOLE WORLD. JESUS PREDICTED THIS WHEN HE SAID \u201cTHEY HATED ME AND THEY WILL HATE AND PERCECUTE YOU.\u201d ISLAM IS A GARBAGE SICK VILE RELIGION THAT HONORS A MURDERER AND PEDOPHILE MOHAMMED. THEY ATTACK WHITE CHRISTIANS JUST FOR BEING WHITE CHRISTIANS; FOR NO OTHER REASON. INVTHIS COUNTRY A WHITE CANNOT WALKBINCA BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD OERIOD.

TJEY BEAT ME UP JYST BECAUSE IM WHITE AND BECAUSE THEY CAN NEVER EVER EVER WIN A DEBATE WITH ME. THE TRUTH WILL SET EVERYONE FREE. HOW IS IT RACIST FOR A WHITE PERSON TO WANT TO PRESERVE WHITE CHRISTIAN CULTURE THAT BUILT THE WHITE COUNTRIES AND THE USA AND CANADA ? LOOKCAT HAITI\u2014 IT HAS BEEN BLACK RULED FOR 200 YEARS AND IS A TOTAL VIOLENT CEESPOOL. NO ONE WANTS TO LIVE THERE. LOOK AT THE AFRICAN COUNTRIES. NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD MOVE THERE.

PEOPLE MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR SHORTCOMINGS AND PROBLEMS THEY CREATE AND NOT BLAME OTHER RACES FOR THEIR FAILURES. THE WHITE RACE HAS LITERALKY SAVED OVER ONE BILLUON LIVES BY THE HIGH TECH MEDICINE THEY HAVE DEVELOPED. NO OTHER PEOPLE ON EARTH GAVED SAVED SO MANY LUVES. THINK OF ALL THE MILLUONS OF DOSES OF LUFE SAVING MEDICINES WHITES HAVE GIVEN THE WHOLE WORLD AND SAVED HUNDREDSVOF MILLIONSOF LIVES. I REPEAT. NON WHITE MEN HAVE NOT DONE THIS YET.

They go about their business, and for the most part never consider their race. To a white man he is merely another human. I certainty never though much about race until I got tired of my people being denigrated at every turn. White people are the only race of people taught to hate and disrespect their own ancestors and history. But women, all women see life through the lens of being a women not a human. For black people everything centers around being black. Gays and lesbians build their entire existence around the fact they are homosexual. Muslims are completely consumed by Islam. Meanwhile, the white man is a blank slate navigating life based on logic and experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNah, the difference between white men and and everyone else is this:\n\nYou believe you get to control the world.\n\nThat\u2019s it. You think you can rape, kill, pillage, steal, colonize and enslave at your will. It is in your DNA. You are the scourge of the earth. You tortured my ancestors, raped Africa, committed genocide against the Jews, Native Americans, Haitians, every island in the Caribbean, the Aztecs, the Inca, the Aborigine and every native population on earth. You are the destruction of the planet. If the devil has a face, he is a white man. You will one day pay for your misdeeds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m just kidding.\n\nI know you two letter writers didn\u2019t do any of that, just like I know Joseph hasn\u2019t invented anything in his life. He doesn\u2019t even have the technical literacy to find the \u201ccaps lock\u201d key, so I know he\u2019s not creating anything in his garage, unless you count meth. I don\u2019t.\n\nMy point is that Joseph and Adolph don\u2019t get to live by two sets of rules. They don\u2019t get to enjoy the privilege of individuality by dissociating themselves from Nazis, domestic terrorists and white supremacists and then castigate others by lumping all other groups into a basket based on stereotypes. So I say this to all white people:\n\nPick one.\n\nEven though I am an educated black man with an IQ high enough to hit the \u201cshift\u201d key, I\u2019m fine with you thinking I might be a stupid gangbanger or a criminal. But if we are going to play that game, you have to admit your personal responsibility for every \u201cshithole\u201d around the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf I am to be a thug, then you have to admit that you are Adolf Hitler and the Ku Klux Klan. If an individual Muslim should automatically be assumed to be a terrorist, then I should assume that all white men are the same as the scum who dragged Emmett Till out of bed or slaughtered billions of babies around the world to make way for white rule.\n\nI\u2019m not accusing you, or any white person, of anything. I\u2019m just saying: If we are going to play the game, pick a set of rules so that I can know which game we are playing.\n\nAnd for God\u2019s sake, hit the goddamn \u201ccaps lock\u201d key!", "keywords": ["horribles", "clapback", "roots", "whites", "basket", "mailbag", "trump", "know", "women", "voted", "men", "black", "white", "im", "say"], "polarity": 0.0025409052312605736, "subjectivity": 0.3439361794437936},

This sentence was supposed to make a hilarious comparison about how every presidential candidate I\u2019ve ever voted for was also the one least likely to make me throw up if I saw them naked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut because of Yesha\u2019s incessant, racist harassment of me and my below-average typing skills, y\u2019all will miss out. You deserve better than this, but you only have Yesha to blame. Anyway, since I don\u2019t have time to craft a funny lede for the mailbag, Here\u2019s some mail.\n\nIt\u2019s a half day! I\u2019m not working beyond 10 a.m. So what a half-day means 1 p.m.? \u2014Yesha\n\nMerry Christmas, motherfuckers.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s an email from a fan of both Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party concerning the article about Doug Jones:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Starr C.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Who sent you? Niggers like you are why black people can\u2019t get anywhere. First you wrote that piece of trash about Doug Jones flyer, then you bash the democratic party. Your always bashing Hillary and democrats, because you and the rest rest of the Bernie bros are still mad that she beat him FAIR AND SQUARE!!!! You at the reason Trump won. I bet you voted for him, but even if you didn\u2019t you spent so much time bashing Hillary that you paved the way for him. You don\u2019t even realize that the republicans don\u2019t mena black people no good. Every time you bash the democrats,you\u2019re helping them. You might as well be the KKK.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019re right, Starr. You figured it out. I\u2019m the reason Hillary lost.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that she took states in the Rust Belt for granted. It wasn\u2019t that she called black people \u201csuperpredators.\u201d It wasn\u2019t because she has such a long history of underhanded shenanigans that President Barack Obama\u2019s voters felt no enthusiasm for her. It wasn\u2019t that she popped up at black churches and barbershops pandering to black people with the see-through bullshittery of how one of her best friends from college \u201cis African American.\u201d\n\nIt was me the whole time.\n\nHad I been \u201cwith her,\u201d she would\u2019ve won because I would\u2019ve told her ass to stop cheating so much. I would have told her not to try to rig the primaries. I would have told the Democratic Party to stop assuming they had the black vote by default. I would have told her to put something about black lives and police brutality in her platform before Black Lives Matter literally forced her to do it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI would have told her to stop lying and fainting. I would have given her something better to wear than pastel-colored karate suits. I would have told her to stop warmongering and nation building. And lying. And fainting. I would have asked her why the fuck was she so moderate? I would have asked her why she was chasing white voters like they owed her $20. I would have made her secure the bag.\n\nMost importantly, had I been with her, I never would have made her, Doug Jones, the Democratic Party or any other white person on the face of the earth into a savior.\n\nThe reason they treat black people like shit is that too many of us believe that just because Hillary, Doug or any other Democrat is slightly better than a Republican, we should be afraid to publicly criticize them. The Democratic Party is the proverbial plantation from which black people are afraid to run because our massa is slightly more benevolent than the other slave owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am sorry Donald Trump is president, but I am not sorry that Hillary Clinton is not my president.\n\nFuck her.\n\nI do not want a slightly better slave master.\n\nI want to be free.\n\nHere\u2019s an email from a Bernie Sanders supporter:\n\n\n\nFrom: Karla P.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Bernie would of won. I loved your piece on the Cornel West feud. I just have one thing to say about your criticism of Bernie Sanders. I know the black community was pulling for Hillary because we blindly vote for whichever Democrat they give us, but her record shows that she was never going to do anything for us. She didn\u2019t do anything for us as a Senator. She didn\u2019t take a stand for us during her husband\u2019s presidency or during her campaign. What you don\u2019t realize about Bernie is that he has been fighting for us since the civil rights movement. Our allegiance to the Democratic party is what kills us politically because they take our votes for granted. The only way our votes will ever matter is if we make politicians earn it. If not for people like you Constantly kissing Hillary\u2019s ass and downing candidates like Bernie, he would of won. Stop leading your people like sheep to the slaughter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHey, Karla!\n\nThank you so much for your kind words in the first paragraph. As for the second part of your email\u2014I\u2019m sorry you feel that way.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, Karla: I am a fan of Bernie Sanders. I want to meet him one day and shake his old, wrinkled hand because I bet it feels like grabbing a pack of hot dogs wrapped in a silk handkerchief. I know it would probably give me the heaves, but I just want to see how it feels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for Bernie as a candidate? He lost, boo. You and the rest of his supporters can stop crying those socialist Democrat white tears any day now. Let that shit go! I know you think Hillary rigged the race, and so do I. But you know what? That\u2019s your fault. What the fuck is wrong with you that you sided with the one white motherfucker on the planet with too much integrity to cheat?\n\nI\u2019m why Bernie lost?\n\nOld man Sanders lost because he brought a rusty-ass, antique knife to a gunfight. I wish politics were more honest, but as long as they aren\u2019t, I want someone who\u2019s willing to slit throats, not some decrepit, counterfeit do-gooder in a J.C. Penney\u2019s suit! Do you know what would have happened if Bernie were in office? The Republican majority in the House and Senate would have eaten him alive and spit him out. Because\u2014and I\u2019m just guessing here\u2014he tastes like a sixth-grade social studies test boiled in hot dog water.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think the only hope for American politics is a true third-party candidate, so I feel no allegiance to the Democratic or Republican Party. I vote for the candidate I want to win, and 99.9 percent of the time, that candidate is a Democrat.\n\nI liked many of Bernie\u2019s ideas and political theories. But I like them in the same way I like the idea of eating a box of hot Krispy Kreme doughnuts while sitting courtside at the Staples Center during Game 7 of the NBA Finals as Lonzo Ball passes the ball to the newly signed LeBron James, who hits the game-winning shot for the Lakers. And as I\u2019m being hugged by Beyonc\u00e9, I barely have time to high-five Colin Kaepernick and congratulate him on his new job as the starting quarterback of the Carolina Diddies before Rihanna taps me on the shoulder and asks me if I want to go to the bathroom and hit the blunt with her, but I can\u2019t ... because you know how my wife gets mad because Rihanna is always sweatin\u2019 me, and I don\u2019t want to argue in the helicopter on the way home.\n\nA Bernie Sanders presidency is as unlikely as that scenario.\n\nKrispy Kreme donuts are trash. Also, I hate the way you\u2019ve just spelled \u201cdoughnuts.\u201d \u2014Yesha\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext are a series of direct messages from a Trump supporter on Twitter named Robert O. You probably wouldn\u2019t be able to understand them, but because I\u2019ve corresponded with so many low-IQ white people since I\u2019ve begun my stint at The Root, I have become fluent in the \u201calt-right\u201d dialect of English. Each one of these is actually a separate message.\n\n\n\nUr a duck\n\nI think he means \u201ccuck,\u201d which is short for \u201ccuckold,\u201d a man who likes to watch other men have sex with their wives. It\u2019s a popular term for people on the alt-right to use against other white men who aren\u2019t as racist as them. Some white people believe that if they aren\u2019t racist enough, they won\u2019t be able to stop the impending black-penis attack that \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d are planning.\n\nCuck\n\nSee, I told you.\n\nAnd a beta male\n\nA beta male is a weak man, not like a strong alpha male. Or maybe he thinks I pledged a white fraternity. Are betas a thing? Can they step?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis one I\u2019m not too sure about.\n\nUr politics are garbage\n\nWe use \u201ctrash\u201d now, Robert.\n\nBy the way, I just looked at your name, and it is one of the few names that are equidistant from both the center of blackness and whiteness. \u201cRobert\u201d isn\u2019t a black name or a white name. It\u2019s just a name. It\u2019s a manly name, though. Roberts probably work hard all day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI often try to imagine what people do just from their names and the letters they write, and I bet you wear gloves to work, Robert. You\u2019re probably employed on a highway crew or cutting meat behind the glass at a grocery store. Yeah, butcher is definitely a \u201cRobert\u201d job. You don\u2019t find many Roberts in the baking or choreographer industries. But I digress ...\n\nUr view all trump supporters are nazis is garbage\n\nThanks for helping my argument, Rob.\n\nAnd ur articles are trash\n\nThat\u2019s fair. See, I told you \u201ctrash\u201d sounds much better!\n\nYou\u2019re welcome!\n\nBlack women are ashy white women are bitchy Asian women eat cats and Hispanic women have fat asses we all have stereotypes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait, Rob, that\u2019s your list of stereotypes? I feel like you could use some help in the stereotyping department. I don\u2019t want to sound racist, but you\u2019re missing out on some good ones.\n\nAll you have for black women is that they\u2019re ashy? Also, are you sure you want to give the \u201cfat asses\u201d to Hispanic women? I would never impugn your racist credentials, but I feel like, statistically speaking ...\n\nYou know what? Imma let you have this one.\n\nSo stop being a faggot\n\nBut I thought I was a cuck? You\u2019re confusing me, Rob. Am I an amphibious bird, the husband of an adulteress or a bundle of sticks? Make up your mind! And why are you on Twitter so much? Those yellow lines aren\u2019t going to paint themselves!\n\nAnd ban me from twitter u west coast lookin. Bitch\n\nWait ... I can do that?\n\nAnd, finally, from a supporter of ... umm, white people?\n\n\n\nFrom: Mitch There\u2019s no need to take sole credit for the Black Community, Michael. Yes they contributed mightily, but so did the media, thousands of volunteers, women, college-age voters (check the campus-town votes), Republicans who refused to vote, Richard Shelby (the write-in votes alone would have made up the difference) and a shit candidate. Happy to see it all working. Let\u2019s keep it all energized for high voter turnout in 2018 and 2020. Identity politics spells losses. It\u2019s wins that count, not credit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of clapping back at Mitch, I\u2019d like to critique and highlight some of my favorite parts of this Twitter direct message.\n\nThe part about how \u201cthere\u2019s no need to take sole credit for the Black Community\u201d is good, because it insinuates that there was another community that voted for Doug Jones. White women voted for Roy Moore. White men voted for Roy Moore. Black men and women voted for Doug Jones. But history shows us that when a white person tells you \u201cthere\u2019s no need\u201d for something, they are about to steal that shit.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s another good part: \u201cYes they contributed mightily but ... \u201d Always remember that everything after the word \u201cbut\u201d is always a lie.\n\nThen there\u2019s the part where he credits \u201cthe media ... volunteers, women, college-age voters ... \u201d Again, he\u2019s white-peopleing. If he extrapolated the statistical data using this thing called \u201cmath\u201d and applied it to college-age voters, he\u2019d see that white college students voted for Roy Moore. The same is true for the campus towns, women, people named \u201cNancy,\u201d people who like hot sauce instead of honey mustard and even praise dancers. This white boy just cannot give black people their due!\n\nWait ... did this motherfucker just say, \u201cRepublicans who refused to vote\u201d? REPUBLICANS WHO REFUSED TO VOTE?

According to Mitch, here\u2019s who should share the glory (in no particular order): black people who voted, white people who overwhelmingly voted for the guy who lost, people doing their motherfucking jobs and white people who did abso-fucking-lutely nothing.

I know this sounds like some Inception-level shit where we make references to a mailbag inside a mailbag about the mailbag, so I will include some new stuff, too.\n\nLast week was a rough week for mail. I feel like you guys weren\u2019t bringing your racist A-game (the \u201ca\u201d stands for asswipe). I had to look for stuff to clap back at. I know it was the day after The Root 100 gala, and I may have awakened in my bed the next morning wearing a tuxedo jacket, formal shoes and no pants. I cannot confirm this, and also ... why are you being so nosy?\n\nLuckily, you guys really stepped up to the hate plate this week. I have received no less than 12 correspondences that contain the word \u201cnigger\u201d in them. While it does show a lack of creativity on the part of racists (400 years and \u201cnigger\u201d is the best you can do?*), it does set a new personal record for me.\n\nBravo, motherfuckers. Bravo.\n\nLet\u2019s read some mail:\n\n\n\n*I prefer the pure simplicity of \u201cporch monkey.\u201d\n\nThe following is a comment on Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan\u2019s article about a hair game, which some (white) people found very offensive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Mike Your just another niggger jealous of white people and pissed because you were born black, I would be to, you blacks snivel about everything and blame everyone else for your woes, but it is you who are to blame for the way people of all races see blacks and the way we see you is justified by the way people of all races see blacks and the way we see you is justified by the way blaks as a whole are, basically lie animals, all races really hate blacks, even blacks hate blacks and kill each other by the hunddreds every day, you wil alwasy be the scum of the earth and rightly so\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMike,\n\nIt is part of human nature to believe that everyone likes the same things and feels the same way you do. If you like a dish, how could anyone else not like it? If a joke makes you laugh, how could anyone else not think it\u2019s funny? The entire staff of The Root still can\u2019t wrap their minds around the idea that, after having tasted bacon, I think it is just \u201ca\u2019ight.\u201d They can\u2019t even process the concept. They have actually come to the conclusion that every time I\u2019ve tried it, it must have been fake bacon. Like there\u2019s an international conspiracy to slip mediocre pork products to Michael Harriot. It\u2019s probably beef lobbyists. Big beef must be behind it* (which, I must add, would be my stripper name). I said all of that to make this point, Mike:\n\nJust because you hate black people doesn\u2019t mean everyone hates black people.\n\nI know the concept is as mind-numbingly implausible as someone\u2019s being apathetic about eating pig thigh meat. I truly understand that so much hate is buried in the rancid, charcoal black muscle you call a heart that you think everyone in the world must obviously have the same despicable disposition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMike, you\u2019re not going to believe me when I say this, but trust me it\u2019s true: Not all white people are racist.\n\nNope. Trust me, it\u2019s true. In fact, I\u2019ll tell you another secret. There are even people in the world (I will admit, they\u2019re probably some kind of lexical geniuses or something) who use periods and all that fancy-schmancy punctuation shit. They even know the difference between \u201cyour\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re.\u201d\n\nNow, I\u2019m going to keep the grammar thing between you and me, because I intend to cite you as a source to every Caucasian crier who says, \u201cNot all white people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThanks, Mike.\n\nThanks,\n\nMike\n\n*That\u2019s what she said.\n\nFrom Twitter user BuildTheWall:\n\nThis comments related to article complaining to whites that bring up black on black crime. You said over 91% of blacks are killed by other blacks & most whites are murdered by other whites & failed to mention that 84% of whites are killed by other whites , blacks commit approximately 50% homicides in the U.S. every year & commit most crime at a much higher ratio / percent of other races. They burn towns / cities & then cry about needing everyone to give them something for free , they take over 35% welfare annually are only 13% - 15% of this nations population & shift the blame saying most welfare goes to whites. They are taught that only white people can be racist in some schools / colleges & this only makes race relations worse. Pointing out facts doesn\u2019t feel good does it? I am no racist & to be honest the world sucks. There will be no end to the shitholes that many poor or unemployed blacks live at in all major cities & poor black areas in general until welfare is cut off for many of them because a large percentage of them don\u2019t need it & just refuse to work like any other race. When you cut off welfare for those that can work & are just sitting home they\u2019ll to get off their asses & find a job. You have no idea how much better life would be for many people if they lost their welfare. I have seen major improvements in attitudes after they started working no matter their skin color. They were scared as hell at first & when they got a job their attitude was much better then when they were relying on welfare because they were able to get an apartment , had money to spend & got out of the shithole they were living in. My girlfriend was one of those black people that relied on welfare because she didn\u2019t want to work. I told her that she was only allowed to eat dollar store soup until she got a job & kept my food which was mainly meat & poultry was in a chest freezer. She left my food alone & found a job in only 1 week . When she got a job she was given a key to the chest freezer & allowed to eat whatever she wanted as long as she mentioned it if I was gone so I could replace it. She was also stuck at home & not able to go out until she got a job. You want to know what she did over it? She was angry at me about it until she got a job & thanked me for making her stay at home because she realized that\u2019s a little like how she was living for years & she no longer feels imprisoned like she was on welfare. She said the job gave her more freedom then she could have imagined & finally has some money to spend because of me. I overheard this when she was talking to a friend because she talks a little loud & th\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is so much to unpack here, so I won\u2019t. Instead, I would like to submit that this isn\u2019t one of the most racist things I\u2019ve ever received, but it is all the racist things I\u2019ve received. If someone wanted to know what kind of hate mail black writers get, this would be my prototype.\n\nIt is excellent in its sheer lack of fucks given about grammar. The way he refers to his arbitrarily derived statistics as \u201cfacts\u201d is baconlike in both taste and saltiness. But you know what my favorite part is? The way, smack dab in the middle of this verbal diarrhea, he says, \u201cI\u2019m no racist.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one of my favorite parts.\n\nI was actually going to include this letter in last week\u2019s mailbag, but last Friday\u2019s bag of bullshit ran pretty long, so I had totally forgotten about the part where he said he had a black girlfriend whom he trained to work and be responsible through a system of starvation and ass-whippings. (I know the DM didn\u2019t say anything about ass whippings, but y\u2019all know. ... You think this guy doesn\u2019t slap women around?) I am also still trying to wrap my head around the fact that an actual woman, with a vagina and everything, let him stick his flaccid, chicken-neck-looking, underdeveloped, thumb-shaped penis inside her. I guess even a trash can catches a steak some days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich brings me to my last point about the worst people on the planet. I know I talk about racism very often, but there is a class of people who are worse than racists: the motherfuckers who put locks on refrigerators.\n\nIf Hitler\u2019s Third Reich had been limited to these motherfuckers, he would have been hailed as a hero. I\u2019ve always heard about these people, but even this brief, momentary contact makes me want to take one of those Silkwood showers where I scrub my skin really hard with a medium-bristle wire brush and then sit on the floor of the shower with my arms wrapped around my legs thinking about the complexities of the human condition and why they don\u2019t make Pop-Tarts without the icing anymore as my tears slowly dissolve down the drain.\n\nSee what I go through for y\u2019all?\n\nThe following are two comments left on last week\u2019s mailbag from a user named Dusty. Dusty was apparently triggered by me saying, \u201cWhite people are evil.\u201d\n\nI like to pop in from time to time to see how other folks view the world who aren\u2019t like me and I have not posted until now. You write that all white people are evil and then try to make a nuanced explanation, but in the end, had a white person said \u201call black people are evil\u201d regardless of the explanation, they would immediately be branded a racist. How do you justify pointing out all the anti-black racism when many comments and articles on this site are anti-white? How do you expect a white person to act when you put your thumb in their eye at every opportunity?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDusty later wrote:\n\nSo you think saying all white people are evil is appropriate? How about all black people are evil?\n\nDearest Dusty,\n\nSorry for putting my thumb in your eye. I\u2019m also sorry that your anus is still so sore from me saying, \u201cWhite people are evil\u201d that you missed the entire point of last week\u2019s mailbag.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd you\u2019re right, by the way. If a white person had said, \u201cAll black people are evil,\u201d I would have assumed they were racist. I probably wouldn\u2019t have typed a letter or comment to the site where they said it, though. I wouldn\u2019t have done it for one particular reason:\n\nIf I were browsing that imaginary site that said, \u201cBlack people are evil,\u201d I bet it would have a million stories on it. I would imagine that it had stories about crime, racism, inequality, injustice, death, satire, politics, pop culture and even achievements. After I perused through all of the other worldviews that are different from mine, the thing I would have been offended by the least (or at least not enough to toggle me into \u201cletter-writing mode\u201d) was someone saying, \u201cBlack people are evil.\u201d Would you like to know why?\n\nBecause I am not evil.\n\nI know it\u2019s hard dealing with the racism against white people. I\u2019ve felt it, too. Last year, while filling out my taxes, I told my son to get his registration so I could see how much I paid to register his car. I walked to the garage with him, and when he fumbled around in the glove compartment searching for the right paper, I yelled at him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wasn\u2019t being mean, but in that moment, all I could think about was, \u201cWhat if the wrong cop was standing over this black kid fumbling around in his glove compartment?\u201d That stupid little moment of teenage carelessness could cost my son his life\u2014because he is black.\n\nIt is a tough thing to wrestle with, watching your children, knowing the more they grow, the more they become prey. It is scary to think about that every time they leave the house. And then I thought, I bet this is just how Dusty feels when he reads words on the internet.\n\nSee? Our battles with racism are the same, Dusty.\n\nBut there is something else in your comments that I\u2019d like to point out:\n\nI said, \u201cWhite people are evil.\u201d\n\nYou asked, \u201cSo you think saying all white people are evil is appropriate?\u201d\n\nYou also wrote, \u201cYou write that all white people are evil and then try to make a nuanced explanation ... \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you notice the difference in those sentences, Dusty?\n\nYou added an \u201call.\u201d I didn\u2019t say \u201call,\u201d Dusty. Thank you for clearing this up for me. Now I understand everything. For so long I\u2019ve been accusing the \u201cnot all white people\u201d crowd of being too sensitive and privileged, but now I understand.\n\nWhite people can\u2019t read!\n\nNow that you\u2019ve pointed it out to me, it\u2019s clear, Dusty! Thank you for that.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying that \u201call\u201d white people are illiterate. Just some. The ones who compare comments on the internet to 400 years of rape, torture, injustice, murder and inequality. The ones so dumb they actually think they can convince people that they are open-minded and sophisticated enough to cruise the internet to hear opinions different from their own, but so sensitive they can\u2019t handle opinions different from their own. The ones so privileged they think they can actually tell people that their opinions aren\u2019t \u201cappropriate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot all white people, Dusty.\n\nJust you.\n\nHey, Mike said it, not me.", "keywords": ["clapback", "evil", "roots", "mailbags", "blacks", "think", "saying", "mailbag", "know", "welfare", "black", "white", "job", "way"], "polarity": -0.06077503969763386, "subjectivity": 0.48780286426729924},

Your claims have been overlooked for too long. They make movies about make-believe stuff like Santa Claus, Bigfoot and Caucasians who can dance, but never took the time to address your fairy tale of reverse racism. Hell, they even made a TV show about the Great Pumpkin and a movie about a sexy rabbit, but nothing about racist writers! How could this be?\n\nWell, today we are going to address the systematic inequality directed at white people. Because black people don\u2019t control Congress, the Senate, every state legislature, the U.S. economy and the media like white people do, dedicating this\u2014our weekly look back at the emails, direct messages and tweets we receive\u2014to the topic is the best we can do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t say we didn\u2019t try.\n\nThis first tweet and email go hand in hand:\n\n\n\nFrom: J.M. and Tucker.\n\nTo: Danielle Belton\n\nSubject: Racism is evil, regardless of the source Ms. Belton, Instead of blaming \u201cwhite people (not a race by the way)\u201d for all the problems in the black community, why don\u2019t you offer some tough love to your fellow blacks? How about stay in school, don\u2019t have sex and get pregnant outside of marriage and obey the law. Or, take responsibility for your own actions, respect authority and work hard. I\u2019m sure there are black parents who are out there who are responsible and raise children who are responsible and positive contributors to society. However, there are a large percentage who do not. My parents and sisters came here from Italy with little more than the clothes on their backs. No one handed them a \u201cwhite privilege card\u201d. They worked hard, saved money and did the best they could for my family. My advice to black people is stop being blinded by a desire for vengeance against \u201cwhite people\u201d and work hard to be prosperous. As they say, \u201cliving well is the best revenge\u201d\n\nDear Bill, J.M. and Tucker:\n\nAs one of Ms. Belton\u2019s \u201cfellow blacks,\u201d I can attest to the fact that she comes to every one of the Global Organizations Dedicated to the Descendants of Africans, Moor and Negroes (GODDAMN) monthly meetings and tells the young kids to stay in school, use condoms and obey the law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe younger \u201cfellow blacks\u201d just won\u2019t listen. You know how they are. Either they are too stupid to know what Danielle is telling them (you know they have lower IQs), or it might have something to do with the fact that unwed motherhood, the dropout rate and crime are all socioeconomic phenomena, and\u2014stripped of race\u2014poor whites have the same crime rate, teenage pregnancy rate and dropout rate. Danielle probably thinks the question should be, \u201cWhy is the black poverty rate so much higher?\u201d But you\u2019re right, J.M. It\u2019s probably because she doesn\u2019t scold her \u201cfellow blacks\u201d enough.\n\nCongratulations on the success of your cousins who moved here from Italy. I\u2019m sure it was difficult for them to succeed, given the fact that Giuseppe Crow Laws were just wiped off the books 50 years ago and the people in power now were the same people in power when this country was still lynching Italians for looking white people in the eye and they could only attend historically Italian colleges, universities and public schools. I\u2019m sure your cousins simply forgot the 250 years when black people couldn\u2019t\u2014as Tucker said\u2014go to the polls when we wanted higher wages, dignified jobs and \u201cleadership that promised to put [all] Americans first, above any foreign nation or domestic interest group.\u201d I guess black people didn\u2019t need that solution to their problems.\n\nHowever, you were right when you said, \u201cLiving well is the best revenge.\u201d That is true. I just wish people like you didn\u2019t build such a high barrier to \u201cliving well\u201d and then act as if we could eliminate the obstacle by telling our kids to \u201cjust climb higher\u201d and pretend like the wall was not there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think you should consider this: Saying \u201cFuck the people who built and maintain this wall\u201d and making fun of the wall builders isn\u2019t racist. It\u2019s just a tiny, microscopic form of \u201cliving well.\u201d\n\nThanks, J.M.\n\nA Twitter direct message from xxneverdasamexx:\n\nI just read your piece about Tucker and when they asked you on his show on fox news. You want to stand on your soap box, make fun of and judge white people because they\u2019re racists? And you think it makes all the racist and bigoted stuff you write about whites ok? And your comment about the quote \u201cthrow a rock into a pack of dogs...\u201d I think that actually applies to you...Tucker called you out and the Root for being racists against whites, now your own logic and using the dog quote, amounts to that of it doesn\u2019t apply, the person will let it fly...but you didnt let it fly, you started yelling like the hit dog. You and the Root are obviously racists against whites. Now, let\u2019s take some of what you wrote about white people and said about white people...you don\u2019t think it makes you racist or that you are racist. But let\u2019s say I wrote everything you wrote, the exact same way, same words..exactly the same..but instead of white, I used black...you would label me a racist white supremacist nazi KKK pos...and you want to talk about how whites shoot up schools and wherever else you said whites do...how about I\u2019m tired of all the dumb blacks who sell heroin and crack all over my city.. how about I\u2019m tired of the dumb blacks who run around in groups, in my city, jumping and beating white people who are alone for no other reason then their white...and you\u2019re the worst type, becuase you\u2019re such a hypocrite that wants to cry and yell that whites are racist, when you spew nothing but racism. The person who see race and racism is everything, is the REAL racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Sir:\n\nYou\u2019re right, The Root shouldn\u2019t make fun of white people. We had no idea you were this fragile, and apologize for all the white tears we caused.\n\nYou are correct that if white people wrote an article making fun of black people the way I and others at The Root make fun of white people, we\u2019d call them racist. But it wouldn\u2019t be because of what you wrote or said. We would object to what you said because it is offensive in combination with how you actually treat black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wanted to clap back at you by saying that unlike your frail, delicate, unseasoned, sallow spirits, black people wouldn\u2019t give a damn what you called us if you treated us equally. But I didn\u2019t want to speak on behalf of everyone at The Root, so I posed this question to the entire staff this morning:\n\nSuppose you were the leader of all the black people in America and you were approached by the leader of all white people [I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s Donald Trump or Taylor Swift] with this proposition: White people could magically erase all inequality, racism, hate, transphobia, homophobia, etc., in the world, but black people would have to agree to one thing: White people would get to address us only as \u201cniggers.\u201d ... Would you accept?\n\nSome immediately agreed to the proposition. Some wondered how we would enforce the agreement, while others didn\u2019t think it would ever work. There was a fierce debate going on until Editor-in-Chief Danielle Belton came in and broke up the conversation and made us get back to work. (And yes, J.M., as we dispersed, she yelled, \u201cMake sure you don\u2019t get pregnant or rob anyone today!\u201d See ... she\u2019s doing her part.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here is my point: Every single person considered it because we don\u2019t give a damn what you call us if you treat us equally! White people are more hurt about some motherfucking articles on a motherfucking website than they are about actual inequality! If that was the only racism black people had to face, we would rejoice.\n\nSo if you only wrote articles about the \u201cdumb blacks\u201d in your city selling heroin (I\u2019m sure it got there on all those black-owned boats and planes) or only wrote about the \u201cdumb blacks\u201d who go around attacking whites, but you eliminated every other form of discrimination and hate, we wouldn\u2019t call you a \u201cracist white supremacist nazi, KKK\u201d piece of shit ...\n\nJust a \u201cpiece of shit.\u201d\n\nFinally, a Twitter direct message:\n\nFrom: Mike Jones\n\nTo: Michael Harriot How does it feel to be one of the biggest racists in America?\n\nI\u2019d like to accept this award on behalf of all the black people who tried their hardest to win this title by simply talking about race. I\u2019d also like to thank some of the past winners, including the Rev.

But just because you brought together every different kind of racist to terrorize a city doesn\u2019t mean you deserve this award. I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cBut we actually killed someone, and Michael Harriot and the staff of The Root have never laid hands on another human being because of their race.\u201d Look, man, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. You just have to work harder next year. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll think of something.\n\nTo Donald Trump: I know you\u2019re over there talking to the panel trying to convince them that there must have been some illegal voting, but let it go. Can\u2019t you see it? We\u2019re more racist than you are. You tried to ban Muslims from entering the country, painted Mexicans as rapists and murderers, and put known white supremacists in your Cabinet. But did you create the term \u201cwypipo\u201d? Did you make jokes about potato salad? No, but we did. Let this be a lesson to you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut let me tell you what makes us the proudest.\n\nIn 1983 Timothy Coggins was seen dancing with a white woman at the People\u2019s Choice nightclub in Griffin, Ga. A few white men got together and kidnapped Coggins. Two of the kidnappers were law enforcement officers. Then they beat him. Then they wrapped a chain around his neck and dragged him for over a mile. But he was still alive.\n\nSo the white men took a knife and stabbed him. They sliced him. They slit him. They took turns. When one of them was too tired, the next man would take over. Then they tied him to a truck again, dragged him a little while longer, then threw him in a ditch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEveryone in town knew who did it because they bragged about the time they killed a nigger and got away with it. One of the killers said he \u201cmissed the good old days when you could kill a black man for no reason.\u201d Another one of them told his wife, \u201cIf you keep on, you\u2019re going to wind up like that nigger in the ditch.\u201d\n\nBut no one told on these men for 34 years. The ones who kept quiet were complicit in the Coggins family\u2019s unending grief. Silence is the most despicable kind of racism there is. I wonder who Coggins\u2019 loved ones hate more: the men who killed Coggins that night, or the ones who knew but didn\u2019t give a damn about their pain and suffering?\n\nBut today I stand before you to tell you that Mike Jones, Tucker Carlson and Fox News viewers everywhere have declared that I and the rest of The Root staff, by poking fun at the flimsy, snowflakelike, thin, pearl skin of America\u2019s ruling class, are more racist than Bill Moore Sr. and Frankie Gebhardt, who allegedly killed Timothy Coggins and left him dying in a ditch, and all the white people who kept the terrible secret for 34 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThank you.", "keywords": ["clapback", "roots", "blacks", "racism", "ok", "racist", "whites", "wrote", "mailbag", "sure", "butthurt", "root", "black", "white", "im"], "polarity": 0.03796901304713804, "subjectivity": 0.39948504764911},

Monique Judge for the record, Black Men have consistently explained the Gay Agenda, and if you like we can have a discussion about it. You and the other coon, Michael Harriot at root.com need to fall back from attacking Confident heterosexual Black Men. Before you call me a Hotep, save it for the person that fit the description. I am a Humanistic Atheist, I don\u2019t give a damn about any form of religion or Spirituality or the dumb Woke shit. The Gay Agenda is just as real as your hate for confident heterosexual Black Men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear IsAllah Self-Kingdom,\n\nFirst, I\u2019d like to congratulate you. Since I\u2019ve been a full-time employee at The Root, we have been arguing about the Hotepest name ever, and you win hands down. While I\u2019m sure you are a fine, upstanding citizen, your name has obviously done a nine-year bid in prison, where it converted to Islam. I bet your name wears a kufi, refers to pork as \u201cswine\u201d and fucks heavyset white girls on the low. I bet your real name is something like Parker Willoughby.\n\nSetting aside the Hotepery that is your name, I want to offer my sincerest condolences, because I know your secret:\n\nYou have a tiny penis, don\u2019t you, IsAllah?\n\nDon\u2019t be ashamed. It happens. That\u2019s probably why you don\u2019t believe in God, and I don\u2019t blame you. What kind of god would allow his people to be tortured and oppressed for 400 years and then give one of his children a pinkie-toe-sized penis?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though I don\u2019t know you, I know men like you. I know men who boast about being \u201cconfident black men,\u201d but in real life, they suffer from the perpetual anger of erectile dysfunction because they can\u2019t get a spoonful of blood to flow into their thimblelike phallus. I recognized your inadequacy because your attitude resembles that of a very stupid white supremacist who claims to be \u201cthe least racist person\u201d we\u2019ll ever meet. He claims to be very smart and says he went to the best schools. I won\u2019t embarrass him by calling his name, except to say that he is a \u201cvery stable genius,\u201d just like you are a \u201cconfident, heterosexual black man\u201d who doesn\u2019t believe in God or religion but calls himself \u201cIsAllah.\u201d\n\nEarlier today, Monique Judge was giggling at guys who talk about the \u201cgay agenda.\u201d Trust me, I don\u2019t giggle. The white man makes us believe that giggling is masculine, but I overstand because I use my fourth eye. Not my third eye, because the number 3 is a relic of Christian slavery from the Holy Trinity, the three wise men and the three blind mice. (Also, my third eye is what I call my penis.)\n\nApparently, you and others live in constant fear that \u201chomosexuals\u201d have a secret plan that could convince you to eat swine and engage in same-sex shenanigans. Don\u2019t fall prey to the gay agenda. I can tell you are a weak-minded individual worried about the prospect that acknowledging the humanity of people whose love looks different from yours could magically render you semen-thirsty. Resist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStay strong, IsAllah.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA coon.\n\nThe next clapback stems from an article at HuffPost by Dwayne Wong (Omowale) entitled \u201cStop Using Hotep as an Insult.\u201d In it, Wong says:\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, hotep is an ancient Egyptian term that means \u201cto be at peace.\u201d This is why it\u2019s distressing to me when I see people trying to use hotep as an insult\u2014some of the writers at the Root are especially at fault for helping degrade the term hotep. These people either do not know what the term means or they know and are deliberately trying to demean African history and culture. The term has been coming up a lot lately in regards to Umar Johnson. Umar has been in the headlines because he is currently under investigation and faces losing his psychology license. Umar has also been caught up in a feud with Tariq Nasheed, the director of the Hidden Colors series. Damon Young gave this definition of hotep: Over the past decade or so, the working definition of \u201cHotep\u201d has morphed into an all-encompassing term describing a person who\u2019s either a clueless parody of Afrocentricity\u2014think \u201cPreach\u201d from Don\u2019t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood\u2014or someone who\u2019s loudly, conspicuously and obnoxiously pro-black but anti-progress. As African people we have been subjected to having our history and culture degraded, distorted, and destroyed for centuries now. The people who have bastardized what hotep means are contributing to that problem. Take Michael Harriot, for example. Harriot is a writer at the Root and he is constantly using his platform there to criticize Umar Johnson. Some of these criticisms have merit, but other times they have gone so far that Harriot himself has had to apologize and admit he was wrong. In his latest article on Umar, Harriot ironically mocks Umar as being a \u201cHotepologist\u201d and miseducator, even though Harriot is operating as a miseducator himself by distorting what the term hotep means. Another article mocks the fight between Umar and Tariq as being \u201cThe Real Husbands of Hotep\u201d. Hotep means to be at peace, so how does that term fit in with the discord that we have seen being displayed between Umar and Tariq. When Umar and Seti had their feud in 2016, another writer at the Root described it as a \u201cHotep Hoedown\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Dwayne,\n\nFirst of all, I want to say: You are right.\n\nEven before I read your article, I had been conflicted about using the word \u201cHotep\u201d as a pejorative. I fully recognize the origin and the meaning of the word. As someone who came to The Root partly because of my blog NegusWhoRead [Editor\u2019s note: And because of me. \u2014Yesha], I realize the importance of taking back words that have been used against us. There is only one problem that I have:\n\nWhat will we call Hoteps?\n\nNeither Damon Young, I nor any other writer at The Root created the term \u201cHotep\u201d to describe the overly woke people who engage in misinformation and thievery against the black community. We use the word because people know what it means. But I readily admit that I fell into the trap of lazily throwing it at those who honestly seek liberation by connecting themselves with their ancestral heritage. While I do think that the default deification of everything Egyptian is problematic for a number of reasons, I recognize that \u201cHotep\u201d is a desperate clinging to a history that has been stripped away from our people by a long legacy of white supremacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTherefore, I promise that I will no longer use it in a derogatory manner. I do not speak for any other writer here, but I\u2019m going to do better. This pledge does, however, lead back to my original problem: What will we call Hoteps? (OK, that was the last time.) I have come up with a list:\n\nWhore-teps\n\n\n\nUmaricans\n\nPoor Tariq-ans\n\nAnkhologist\n\nQuack Lies Matter\n\nWokeheads\n\nNeo Not-Sees\n\nHidden Coloreds\n\nBlacksliders\n\nIsAllah Self Kingdom\n\nHopefully one of those will suffice.\n\nFrom: Justin Other Nigga\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: The Root is anti-black Hey faggot, How much do they pay you to keep bashing black men like Umar? How many people do you mentor? What are you doing for the black community? have you done anything other tna tear black men down? Why do you have so much hate for men like Umar?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Justin,\n\nLet me tell you a story.\n\nI grew up poor as fuck. Not underprivileged\u2014poor. Nights-without-electricity poor. Days-without-water poor. Cereal-and-water-for-dinner poor. I lived in a very religious household and was homeschooled until I was 12.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy first year attending school, I was excited to experience many of the things most people take for granted. I remember how incredibly pumped I was for picture day at school. When that day came, each student was supposed to bring $10 to have his or her picture taken. The night before picture day, my mother informed my sisters and me that she only had $30\u2014not enough for pictures for my three sisters and me. As the only boy in the house, I told her to let my sisters take their pictures. I was heartbroken, but I was over it by the next morning.\n\nThen a miracle happened.\n\nI swear on everything that is good and true that I exited the house on the morning of picture day, and lying on the ground was a $10 bill! I could have taken that money and had my picture taken, but I knew that the reason I couldn\u2019t take pictures was that my mother had to be dead broke. She was in her last week of college and wasn\u2019t working, so I gave her the money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was a Friday. The next day at church (we attended church on Saturdays), I watched my mother put $10 in the offering plate. I still believe that my mother put that money in the offering because she thought she was \u201csowing a seed.\u201d That\u2019s how blind, desperate faith works.\n\nAfter service that night, everyone gathered around in the church parking lot to gaze at the pastor\u2019s shiny new car. (It was a shitty Chrysler New Yorker, but to me, it was a might as well have been a Maserati.)\n\nFuck Umar Johnson and all the thieving motherfuckers sucking the souls and money from anyone hoping to sow a seed for black people because we are desperate for something ... anything. I hope they die a fiery death in the depths of hell. I want my foot to be the one that kicks them over the edge. They are worse than white supremacists. I\u2019d rather have a cross on my lawn than a hand in my pocket.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root is not making me rich. When I heard about Johnson\u2019s hearing, I was going to go whether The Root sent me or not. I had planned on paying my own way the same as I had done when I went to Ferguson, Mo.; Baltimore; Jena, Texas; and Sanford, Fla. I didn\u2019t ask a black person for a dime to go to any of those places.\n\nYes, I am a hater. I hate con men. The $10 I found on my way to school did as much good for people as the $400,000 raised by Johnson. He has never produced a business plan, budget or shred of evidence that he is starting a school. If he can prove where the money he collected went, I will take back every word I\u2019ve ever said about him. I\u2019ve done it before. I am not happy he is defrauding people who want a school for black boys. I want one, too.\n\nAs long as I have fingers to type and a platform, I will never leave him alone. So call me a faggot. I could care less about what you\u2014wait ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\n...

I quickly quipped, \u201cThat nigga Jamaal be tripping,\u201d and everyone burst into laughter.\n\nJamaal got in my face and kindly informed me that he was going to kick my ass. Scared, I ran home and hid in the house. My mother saw the fear in my eyes, and do you know what she did? She grabbed me by my collar and said: \u201cAight. I mean ... Jamaal is pretty big.\u201d\n\nThe next day, no one remembered me running home like a scared rat, but they remembered that joke I said about Jamaal.

Blame Yesha.\n\n[Thank you; that was a good fable/introduction. \u2014Yesha]\n\nThe following is a direct message from a Twitter user named P0lymorphic:\n\n\n\nFrom: P0lymorphic\n\nTo: Michael Harriot You are aware hate crimes apply to all people. Not just people of color. https://www.theroot.com/when-the-irish-weren-t-white-1793358754 \u2026 this article is offensive, remove it or I\u2019ll call your local pd and file a complaint for hate crimes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear P0lymorphic,\n\nI rarely do this, but I am reaching out to you because I am confused. A few weeks ago we published an article about Nazi furries that engendered a furtwa against me. Every day since, I have received hate mail from people who like to dress up as magenta German shepherds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can see that your Twitter bio picture is some kind of animal in a Nazi uniform. Because of the past few weeks, that\u2019s not so weird. The crazy part is this: In your direct message accusing me of a \u201chate crime,\u201d you never mentioned furries, the alt-right furry article or anything about your polymorphism!\n\nThis leaves me with some questions for you, P0lymorphic. I hope you can provide some clear answers:\n\n\n\nWhy are you dressed up like an alt-right golden retriever? Look, I get it, we all have our preferences. I am not a human supremacist. I feel like blacks, whites, Hispanics, Asians and people who want to walk around like the love child of Sonic the Hedgehog and a Teletubbie all deserve the same rights. What puzzles me is why you want to marginalize others. Who are you specifically against? Black bears? Do you want to build a wall to keep out the chihuahuas coming here to take your furry jobs? Are you Homo (sapiens) phobic?\n\nAre you Irish? The link you provided is to an article about the false notion that the Irish were slaves. Was that a mistake, or are you willing to forgive me for making fun of your predilection for polymorphism, but the fact that I wrote about the Irish upsets you? What are you going to tell the police? When they come to your home to answer the complaint, will you be wearing your SS-officer fox outfit? Are you going to ... wait. I think I just figured it out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know what\u2019s going on. You\u2019re trying to fuck a police dog, aren\u2019t you, P0lymorphic? You\u2019re using my splendid name to lure an unsuspecting K-9 officer to your home so you can make sweet love to another animal in uniform.\n\nI refuse to be a part of your sick games, P0lymorphic. I see through your little ruse. Shame on you!\n\nThe next message is from the comment section for Monique Judge\u2019s article about why emotional maturity and emotional intelligence are important in healthy relationships:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear AluNoir:\n\nMonique\u2019s definitions of emotional intelligence and emotional maturity come directly from psychological definitions, specifically, Psychology Today. But it brings up a greater point about a subject we need to discuss: I don\u2019t think you\u2019re very emotionally intelligent or mature, AluNoir. I have never met you personally, so I am basing my conjecture on one theory:\n\nHit dogs.\n\nThere is an old Southern saying that goes, \u201cA hit dog will holler,\u201d meaning that when you say or do something to a group of people, the one who is offended will let it be known. This happens often at The Root. Allow me to present you with another recent example:\n\nThis week I wrote this article:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could easily find 10 comments that objected to the article, but I think the easiest way would be to just post this letter (that\u2019s right, you are about to see a clapback inside a clapback. That\u2019s some Inception-level shit):\n\nFrom: Kristi Z\n\nTo: Michael Harriot Michael, it\u2019s hard to understand how you could write an article about Trump calling Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas being racist and then call all white women Beckies. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s just as bad? Using your logic, if Trump using a traditional native American name as a slur means he hates Indians, does this means you hate all women? I can tell youdo but I want to hear you say it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAluNoir, Kristi is a Becky.\n\nShe makes a good point that, all things being equal, calling a woman \u201cPocahontas\u201d is the same as calling a white woman a \u201cBecky.\u201d But here is the thing\u2014and I\u2019m going to type it in all caps, which, in internet parlance, means I am yelling. Because I am about to yell:\n\nALL THINGS ARE NOT EQUAL!\n\nThat is the entire point of the term \u201cBecky.\u201d That is the entire point of the term \u201cwypipo.\u201d If the infinitely small dig of \u201cBecky\u201d and \u201cwypipo\u201d upsets you, then imagine how white supremacy must feel. Imagine how being labeled a \u201cthug\u201d feels. Or \u201cunderprivileged.\u201d Or \u201curban.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most important (here is where I tie the point up in a neat little bow), anyone who objects to the the truth of a psychological definition or a hackneyed joke of a quiz is probably a hit dog.\n\nAluNoir thinks that Monique must be living in an alternate reality because she believes in psychology. AluNoir believes that anyone who uses the actual definition of a term is delusional. AluNoir is emotionally unintelligent and emotionally immature. Alu Noir is a hit dog.\n\nJust like Kristi. Kristi literally believes that anyone who makes a joke about white women must obviously hate all women. According to Kristi, that is the only possible explanation. I mean ... who could possibly dislike white women, with their entitled attitudes and their credit-card-shaped buttocks?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy Kristi\u2019s standards, either I\u2019m a hater or there are people on this earth who actually believe that there are some white women whose entire existence is predicated on their privilege. Kristi can\u2019t fathom that it could possibly be the former, so it must be the latter. Kristi is a hit dog. Kristi is a Becky.\n\nI beg of you, AuNoir ...\n\nDon\u2019t be like Kristi.\n\nThe next letter is an email to one of our female writers. I have concealed her name in case there are others out there like this:\n\n\n\nFrom: Ron E.\n\nSubject: Your worn panties Would it be possible for you to sell me your worn panties? Please let me know.\n\nThank you kindly. XOXOX Ron\n\nDear Ron,\n\nFirst of all, I am jealous. I have been writing for The Root for quite a while and no one has solicited a pair of my boxers. Even though I am disappointed, I will let it go so that I can bring up another salient point:\n\nWhy, though?\n\nWhy do you want a pair of panties? More important, what endows you with the confidence to ask?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have often wondered how men like Louis C.K., Harvey Weinstein and Mark Halperin would think that a woman would want to see them masturbate. How could they pose questions like, \u201cYou wanna see me wash my bloated, fluorescent dad bod in the shower or watch me manhandle my penis like a bicycle pump?\u201d I have come up with a theory:\n\nIt works.\n\nI can\u2019t believe that these middle-aged men would continue to ask women these obscene questions if no one, at some point, said yes. Human nature doesn\u2019t work that way. Therefore, I have come up with a solution I call the \u201cThanksgiving rule.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you are a man, every Thanksgiving, you should gather your aunts, sisters, mother and grandmother in a room and reveal your sexual proclivities. Tell them, \u201cI\u2019m trying to find a woman who likes when a man grabs her breasts without asking.\u201d Ask them if they know a nice girl at their church who might be looking for a guy to furiously masturbate into their house plant.\n\nIf they look disgusted or throw mashed potatoes in your face, take that as a sign that you shouldn\u2019t do it to strangers. If you can\u2019t do it at home, don\u2019t do it in public.\n\nI think I just solved the entire sexual-misconduct crisis. That\u2019s what the mailbag is here for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.", "keywords": ["clapback", "tripping", "roots", "point", "hate", "article", "important", "wypipo", "think", "mailbag", "kristi", "women", "white", "jamaal", "thats"], "polarity": -0.0044653880070546735, "subjectivity": 0.49038800705467367},

It is understandable that the psychological damage due to slavery, Jim Crow and Segregation still pervades the mind of many African Americans. Moreover, the Black Elites who are taking their cues from the White Liberal Elite and Democratic Leadership are also continuing to push the premise of Black Victimization and White Supremacy. The reality is that the cafe has the right not to give Black kids candy. It is their cafe. The same way you have the right to open a cage next door that will compete against this \u201cracist cafe.\u201d Or the right not to shop at that cafe. The only way to gain your respect is to build your own and stop complaining about racism. The fact is there are no government institutions in the USA in 2017 that will block African American or Black Americans from starting a competing cafe or any other business for that matter. Yes there are individual people who are racists, but that will never change.What needs to change is the victim attitude and playing the race card. The race card is lame and no one is listening or cares cause our community is not respected. America is the greatest country for economic opportunity and mobility. Plan and work harder and smarter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMadril,\n\nI don\u2019t know how to tell you this in a tactful way, so I will just go ahead and say it because you aren\u2019t aware of the truth behind this statement:\n\nWhite people are evil.\n\nAfter reading your bullshit reasoned explanation, I was hesitant about making such a broad generalization. I even deleted and rewrote the sentence a few times. Then I realized that someone had to tell Madril. Maybe it should be me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore you get upset about me painting white people with such a broad brush, I want you to know that I don\u2019t think all white people are evil. According to my rough calculations, the percentage of evil white people is about the same as the ratio of poisonous snakes or venomous spiders to their respective populations overall. Now, I could take a course in herpetology and learn how to differentiate the killer snakes from the harmless ones, but just to be safe, I don\u2019t fuck with snakes.\n\nI know you don\u2019t want to think your people are evil, Madril. Neither do I. At first I tried to convince myself that maybe it was just Madril. Maybe Satan ejaculated into a shitbag of a human being who just happened to be ovulating, and 13 months later, out popped Madril (I think there is a longer gestation period for tiny pieces of toilet asswipe clotted with dried remnants of day-old diarrhea manifested in human form. I\u2019m pretty sure I read that in a medical journal), but then I thought, \u201cNah ... it\u2019s white people.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not your fault, Madril. You were enabled by your evil peers. I doubt that you are even aware of your evilness. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure of it. I\u2019m not shocked that you actually sat down and wrote a letter that used free-market economics to rationalize literally taking candy from babies\u2014any evil individual could do that. But you sent it to someone, Madril! The fact that you released it into the wild for all the world to see is proof that your people have normalized it until you are unaware of how vile you are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though you are a trash human being, don\u2019t despair. There is always room in this world for demons like you. I mean, it was your people who came up with the idea to combine two of the most despicable activities and ruin the world by simultaneously raping and pillaging. You used white-people-ing economics to justify colonization, genocide and the trans-Atlantic slave trade, so why not use it to explain how you fucked over babies who just wanted to trick-or-treat?\n\nSo go out there and keep shitting on toddlers, Madril. Keep on tricking. Keep on injecting poison into the world.\n\nMake your people proud.\n\nThis comment from \u201cSweetJamesJones\u201d is from The Root staffer Danielle Young\u2019s (I don\u2019t know her title, but I think it\u2019s either \u201cdope person\u201d or \u201cexecutive in charge of making fun of that one time Michael Harriot had on too much lip balm\u201d) brave article this week about her experience with famous men:\n\nAs a guy, I just want to say that this is tough. I want to be clear that the guys who did this stuff was wrong, but men are left in a Catch-22. I\u2019m sure I will be eviscerated, but here goes the reasoning. First, a lot of women love that type of attention. They feel it is complimentary, and it makes them feel wanted. Maybe all women are uncomfortable and not saying anything, but that\u2019s highly unlikely. Secondly, men have to pursue women, but there are no guidelines to doing so. All women have a different tolerance for flirting and contact. If a guy never makes an advance, he never gets a woman. If he comes in weak and respectful, some women will hate that. If he comes on strong, some women will see it as harrassment. As a guy, I\u2019m perplexed as to what to do as some women would feel uncomfortable if you simply ask them on a date. Instead of simply calling out these guys, can people actually come up with clear direction on how guys should act. Finally, Weinstein and others were clearly wrong. I am not defending that, but this seems like they simply found you attractive and wanted a chance. Its in a grey area.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSweetJamesJones,\n\nYou know how I just eviscerated Madril a few seconds ago? Well, after careful consideration, in light of the revelations about Jesse Jackson, John Singleton, Harvey Weinstein, Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore and, now, Louis C.K., I think I need to say this:\n\nMen are trash.\n\nI know women say that shit all the time as if it were a joke, but they have no idea the percentage of men who are shit bags who should be tossed on the trash heap of humanity. We ain\u2019t shit. None of us. Myself included.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYep, I ain\u2019t shit, either, SweetJamesJones. If I wasn\u2019t a piece of human garbage, my knuckles would be bleeding from punching motherfuckers like you in their fuckboy mouths. When I read about people like Bill Cosby, R. Kelly or Harvey Weinstein, I\u2019m not even shocked, because every man knows multiple other nonfamous men who do the same thing (minus the asking women if they can masturbate in front of them. That\u2019s strictly a white-boy thing). But we don\u2019t say shit because we aren\u2019t shit.\n\nSo you\u2019re saying men don\u2019t know where to draw the line for sexual harassment because some women like it? What kind of idiotic statement is that? There is a small minority of people who like everything, SweetShitJones. I know a woman who likes ketchup on her eggs, but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t an atrocity. I once saw heard about a documentary on this streaming site called Pornhub about a man who became sexually excited from women defecating on him. He liked it. So would it be OK if a woman shit in your mouth without asking you, SweetJamesJones?\n\nJames, you say there are no guidelines to pursuing women. But there are. I\u2019ll tell you where the line is:\n\nStop. Being. White. People.\n\nSexism is just like racism, James. Only white people and toxic motherfuckers like you think in those selfish terms of not giving a damn about how anyone feels as long as you can ejaculate at the end of the encounter. You can\u2019t rape and enslave whole human beings because you want to have an orgasm or own a plantation, James. That\u2019s evil, man. There is just no other way to say it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know what the fucked-up thing is, James?\n\nI believe you don\u2019t know where the line is. I believe you were being sincere. I believe Madril was being sincere. Madril doesn\u2019t feel like he hates black people, and you don\u2019t believe you hate women. At least Madril is just taking literal candy.\n\nBut just as Madril believes racism is a byproduct of normal society, you believe sexual harassment is a byproduct of your inherent male right to stick your dick into a moist hole\u2014all other humans be damned. The line is you, James. You are already across it because you think there is actually a line where you can almost sexually harass someone, but not quite!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoddamn, man, what the fuck is wrong with you?\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with us?\n\nWe ain\u2019t shit.\n\nDamn, damn, damn, James.\n\nI\u2019m out.", "keywords": ["clapback", "roots", "think", "dont", "mailbag", "area", "know", "gray", "women", "black", "white", "im", "say", "shit", "madril"], "polarity": -0.02480267748124891, "subjectivity": 0.490844671201814},

For his part, Felix said he had nothing to do with the Trump campaign. News of the Moscow real estate deal came to light this week after democrats on the House Intelligence Committee released a status report outlining dozens of leads they say they could not pursue after the republicans shut down the committee\u2019s investigation, according to Business Insider.\n\nHere is a rundown of how Sater was pursuing the Moscow deal, per Business Insider:\n\nSater and Trump\u2019s longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, were pushing for the deal with VTB in Moscow at the height of the presidential election, in late 2015 and early 2016. The revelation will likely draw sharp scrutiny from the special counsel Robert Mueller, who recently subpoenaed the Trump Organization for documents related to the Trump Tower Moscow deal. Sater first sent a non-binding letter of intent to Cohen outlining the terms of the \u201cTrump World Tower Moscow\u201d deal on October 13, 2015, The New York Times previously reported. Andrey Rozov, a Russian investor, had already signed it by the time Sater forwarded it to Cohen, and Trump signed the letter. Weeks later, the two men exchanged a series of emails gearing up to celebrate the Trump Tower Moscow deal. In the emails, obtained by The Times, Sater bragged about his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and told Cohen he would \u201cget all of Putins team to buy in\u201d on the deal. \u201cOur boy can become president of the USA and we can engineer it,\u201d Sater wrote, according to The Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBesides being a Trump associate, Sater spent the past two decades as a top US intelligence asset for the DIA, CIA and the FBI. He even claims to have pursued high-level terrorists \u2014 including Osama bin Laden.\n\nHe won\u2019t say whether or not he has been interviewed by Mueller. But it is very likely that Mueller is well aware of Sater\u2019s intelligence work because he was the FBI Director during much of the time he was working for the feds.", "keywords": ["claims", "russian", "election", "vtb", "sanctioned", "cohen", "sater", "bank", "mueller", "trump", "moscow", "pursued", "tower", "likely", "deal", "organization", "felix"], "polarity": 0.06828567055839785, "subjectivity": 0.35109974200883287},

As we close out 2017, we would like to thank our haters because we don\u2019t know where we\u2019d be without you. (Actually, we do know where we\u2019d be without you. We\u2019d be fractionally happier, I\u2019d probably have a better relationship with Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan, and the writers at The Root wouldn\u2019t have a faint sense of dread every time they open an email.)\n\nBut without you, none of this would have been possible. I\u2019d probably have to spend my Friday mornings doing something besides conjuring up the spirit of Ric Flair, so from all of us to all of you, we offer a sincere thumbs-up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe finger in the middle is the thumb, right?\n\nOur first selection pertains to a piece that serves as a yearly divining rod for white tears: the 2017 Wypipo Awards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst this comment from Iceseller:\n\nHey look everyone. The racist in chief of this racist blog wrote something racist again! How edgy. Fuck off you racist piece of shit. Maybe 2018 will see you fired and have to be racist somewhere else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis email from the cleverly named U. R. Gay:\n\nFrom U.R. Gay\n\nTo: Michael Harriot What If a white person wrote something the 2017 nigger awards you would call them a racist. You are a world-class racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this comment from Kodimah:\n\nImagine being so race obsessed you write a satiric column about another race thinking you aren\u2019t a gigantic racist yourself. Sad.\n\nDearest Iceseller, Mr. or Ms. Gay, and Kodimah:\n\nFirst of all, I would like to thank Iceseller for pre-emptively naming me to the position of \u201cracist in chief,\u201d but as a firm believer in democracy, I cannot, in good conscience, accept the title without a vote of some kind. While your admiration for me is appreciated, there are candidates far more qualified who could serve in this position.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTake the aforementioned Mr. Gay, for instance (I don\u2019t want to gender-profile anyone, but I\u2019m going to go ahead and assume that U.R. Gay is a guy). He seems like a perfect nominee for the position. He said that I am a \u201cworld-class racist,\u201d which means he has apparently traveled the world ranking them. I would think that he would be a better fit to serve as the king of all racists.\n\nBut I\u2019d like to push this conversation forward by pointing out something that seems obvious to me but has obviously flown over the heads of some of our readers. The Root is a publication that covers black America. Racism against black people is a problem in America. We write about it. We are no more obsessed with race than Deadspin is obsessed with sports, The Takeout is obsessed with food, Jalopnik is obsessed with cars or Jezebel is obsessed with the fact that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote. It is literally my job to talk about race.\n\nI think Kodimah put it best when he or she said: \u201cImagine being so race obsessed you write a satiric column about another race thinking you aren\u2019t a gigantic racist yourself. Sad.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet me explain what white privilege is:\n\nImagine living in a building with a sniper waiting outside. Imagine that, every day, the sniper shot someone who was exiting your building. Sometimes the sniper was in full sight, and other days the sniper was hidden, but he kept shooting at the people who lived in the building as they walked out.\n\nWhite privilege is the ability to say, \u201cYeah, but people in other buildings get shot, too.\u201d White privilege is the penchant for residents of safer buildings to ask why you don\u2019t just move out of the building. White privilege is being able to say, \u201cYeah, snipers exist, but you can\u2019t worry about them all the time.\u201d But most of all, white privilege is the oblivious idiocy of standing on the sidewalk and asking someone who could be killed by a sniper at any minute, \u201cWhy are you so obsessed with snipers?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow imagine reading a piece of satire written by a resident of the building, making fun of snipers. There is only one reason that I can surmise why anyone would be more angry at the person making jokes about snipers than they were at actual snipers:\n\nBecause they are a sniper, too.\n\nKodimah is right.\n\nIt is sad.\n\nFrom: Stephanie\n\nTo: The Root Staff The Root, I\u2019ve been a supporter for a long time. The fact that Skip Gates is a founder spoke to me about your integrity. Lately, I\u2019ve seen way too much cussing and specifically F bombs in your posts.\n\nIt\u2019s not cute. It\u2019s not funny. It\u2019s vulgar and common.\n\nIt\u2019s BENEATH you. As professional journalists and editors, if you must cuss to get your point across, you\u2019re in the wrong profession. Tired of it,\n\nStephanie\n\nStephanie, I get your point. I really do.\n\nMy mother is a wise woman and she, too, was a writer. When I was a kid, she forbade us from using vulgar language, including calling someone a \u201cdog,\u201d a \u201cliar\u201d or \u201cstupid.\u201d She only had two exceptions:\n\nif we were telling a story and the person in the story said the vulgar word or phrase if we could make a logical case why the word was necessary\n\nThose rules are basically the same rules to which we adhere at The Root. I know I have a foul mouth, and I am often asked by the editors and copy editors if a certain word is necessary. Sometimes they change those words without even asking me. I don\u2019t even have a problem with that because I know I can be hyperbolic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if you are a regular reader of The Root, then you know we use a million creative insults, euphemisms and allusions to replace dirty words. I reject the idea that there are \u201cbad words\u201d or that using vulgar language is a sign of a lack of intelligence, and here is why:\n\nSome people are motherfuckers.\n\nThere is a difference between not giving a darn and not giving a fuck. Knocking the crap out of a person is different from slapping the shit out of someone. Sometimes the words you consider to be boorish are the ones that perfectly describe a situation or thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRacism, homophobia, discrimination and Donald Trump are vulgar. Tamping down the description of those things by playing lexical dodgeball with the vocabulary to preserve the pearls that our readers may clutch is not our job.\n\nA few days ago I wrote a story about a Sacramento, Calif., policeman named John Tennis who had a habit of trying to hit black suspects with his car. He shot multiple black people and killed at least two. Even his fellow police officers said that he often discharged his weapon when it wasn\u2019t necessary. Raheem Hosseini of the Sacramento News and Review wrote a puff piece about him that made him into a sympathetic figure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could have called them both colostomy bags filled with racism and prejudice. I could have used flowery language to explain how Tennis exemplified the persistent deadly threat posed by men whose uniforms have become a license to cosplay as executioners. I probably could have blistered Hosseini as an entitled equivocator who uses black lives as a stepladder to get closer to the spotlight while using his pen to blot out the bloodstains of the slaughtered innocent. But no ...\n\nFuck those guys.\n\nWhenever we write about Umar Johnson, we get a lot of email from his followers. Here are three:\n\nA direct Twitter message from Kwesi X:\n\nDear sir, I am from overseas and would like to let you know how sick you make me. Why you\u2019ve spent all your time gunning for Dr umar I\u2019ll never know I just want u to answer, How many kids u council? How many people u visited in jail to do free speaking events? Even if u don\u2019t like umar if u really a journalist of credibility you would have presented a balanced article not a I hate umar hit story. You are a fake black owned company that is simply marketed to black people. But your not really helping are you? Just making money on the drama You should be ashamed of yourself\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd these tweets:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear sirs,\n\nFirst of all, no one who is originally from outside the country says that he is \u201cfrom overseas.\u201d I don\u2019t believe you. You need more Hotep people.\n\nI admit that I am conflicted about using the word \u201cHotep\u201d as a derogatory term because I know the history of the word, but I will also confess that when I was assigned the Umar story, I thought, \u201cHere come the Hoteppers.\u201d I am also tired of writing about Umar Johnson, but I think it is my responsibility. I don\u2019t hate Johnson\u2019s message of \u201cblack consciousness,\u201d any more than I hate the bullshit of prosperity gospel, except for one fact:\n\nHe steals from black people.\n\nLet me be clear:\n\nI believe that black people should know their history. I believe that our connection to our ancestors is important. I believe that there should be a school for black boys with an African-centered education. I desperately hope that someone builds one. I hope there comes a day when there is one in every city and black children can learn how the great Greek philosophers had to go to Africa to get their knowledge, and how the noble, ancient Europeans were bitch-slapped by the Moors and learned agriculture, irrigation, science and astronomy from dark people. One day someone will come with a plan to build and fund this dream.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen that day comes, there will be people who say, \u201cI would donate, but the last time I gave money to something like this, a charlatan who claimed to be a descendant of Frederick Douglass conned me out of my coins.\u201d They will remember how he answered his phone while it was ringing and puffed up his chest whenever anyone asked him to show his Ph.D. People will recall how he publicly preached about the black family while fucking exotic dancers on the low-low. Some will bring up the fact that the last guy who was going to build a school would never show the receipts for how he spent the money.\n\nUmar Johnson\u2019s antics actually make it harder to build this school. If anyone ever achieves the goal of making this a reality, it will be in spite of Umar Johnson, not because of him.\n\nAnd we are not anti-Umar. When everyone doubted Johnson\u2019s degree, it was The Root that spent money to verify his Ph.D. and end the speculation. I am the one who spent days combing through yearbooks and graduation programs hoping that he was legitimate. When I found the evidence, I admitted that I was wrong. In. The. Headline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am also the one who has refused to shade him even as I am constantly contacted by people in and outside the \u201cconscious movement\u201d who claim to have personal knowledge that always turns out to be spurious because they have a beef with Johnson.\n\nNo one here hates Umar Johnson.\n\nWe just like the truth.", "keywords": ["clapback", "awards", "roots", "racist", "umar", "old", "mailbag", "know", "dont", "word", "cusswords", "sniper", "obsessed", "root", "black", "white", "friend"], "polarity": -0.019970001889644755, "subjectivity": 0.5327755247398107},

Your claims have been overlooked for too long. They make movies about make-believe stuff like Santa Claus, Bigfoot and Caucasians who can dance, but never took the time to address your fairy tale of reverse racism. Hell, they even made a TV show about the Great Pumpkin and a movie about a sexy rabbit, but nothing about racist writers! How could this be?\n\nWell, today we are going to address the systematic inequality directed at white people. Because black people don\u2019t control Congress, the Senate, every state legislature, the U.S. economy and the media like white people do, dedicating this\u2014our weekly look back at the emails, direct messages and tweets we receive\u2014to the topic is the best we can do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t say we didn\u2019t try.\n\nThis first tweet and email go hand in hand:\n\n\n\nFrom: J.M. and Tucker.\n\nTo: Danielle Belton\n\nSubject: Racism is evil, regardless of the source Ms. Belton, Instead of blaming \u201cwhite people (not a race by the way)\u201d for all the problems in the black community, why don\u2019t you offer some tough love to your fellow blacks? How about stay in school, don\u2019t have sex and get pregnant outside of marriage and obey the law. Or, take responsibility for your own actions, respect authority and work hard. I\u2019m sure there are black parents who are out there who are responsible and raise children who are responsible and positive contributors to society. However, there are a large percentage who do not. My parents and sisters came here from Italy with little more than the clothes on their backs. No one handed them a \u201cwhite privilege card\u201d. They worked hard, saved money and did the best they could for my family. My advice to black people is stop being blinded by a desire for vengeance against \u201cwhite people\u201d and work hard to be prosperous. As they say, \u201cliving well is the best revenge\u201d\n\nDear Bill, J.M. and Tucker:\n\nAs one of Ms. Belton\u2019s \u201cfellow blacks,\u201d I can attest to the fact that she comes to every one of the Global Organizations Dedicated to the Descendants of Africans, Moor and Negroes (GODDAMN) monthly meetings and tells the young kids to stay in school, use condoms and obey the law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe younger \u201cfellow blacks\u201d just won\u2019t listen. You know how they are. Either they are too stupid to know what Danielle is telling them (you know they have lower IQs), or it might have something to do with the fact that unwed motherhood, the dropout rate and crime are all socioeconomic phenomena, and\u2014stripped of race\u2014poor whites have the same crime rate, teenage pregnancy rate and dropout rate. Danielle probably thinks the question should be, \u201cWhy is the black poverty rate so much higher?\u201d But you\u2019re right, J.M. It\u2019s probably because she doesn\u2019t scold her \u201cfellow blacks\u201d enough.\n\nCongratulations on the success of your cousins who moved here from Italy. I\u2019m sure it was difficult for them to succeed, given the fact that Giuseppe Crow Laws were just wiped off the books 50 years ago and the people in power now were the same people in power when this country was still lynching Italians for looking white people in the eye and they could only attend historically Italian colleges, universities and public schools. I\u2019m sure your cousins simply forgot the 250 years when black people couldn\u2019t\u2014as Tucker said\u2014go to the polls when we wanted higher wages, dignified jobs and \u201cleadership that promised to put [all] Americans first, above any foreign nation or domestic interest group.\u201d I guess black people didn\u2019t need that solution to their problems.\n\nHowever, you were right when you said, \u201cLiving well is the best revenge.\u201d That is true. I just wish people like you didn\u2019t build such a high barrier to \u201cliving well\u201d and then act as if we could eliminate the obstacle by telling our kids to \u201cjust climb higher\u201d and pretend like the wall was not there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think you should consider this: Saying \u201cFuck the people who built and maintain this wall\u201d and making fun of the wall builders isn\u2019t racist. It\u2019s just a tiny, microscopic form of \u201cliving well.\u201d\n\nThanks, J.M.\n\nA Twitter direct message from xxneverdasamexx:\n\nI just read your piece about Tucker and when they asked you on his show on fox news. You want to stand on your soap box, make fun of and judge white people because they\u2019re racists? And you think it makes all the racist and bigoted stuff you write about whites ok? And your comment about the quote \u201cthrow a rock into a pack of dogs...\u201d I think that actually applies to you...Tucker called you out and the Root for being racists against whites, now your own logic and using the dog quote, amounts to that of it doesn\u2019t apply, the person will let it fly...but you didnt let it fly, you started yelling like the hit dog. You and the Root are obviously racists against whites. Now, let\u2019s take some of what you wrote about white people and said about white people...you don\u2019t think it makes you racist or that you are racist. But let\u2019s say I wrote everything you wrote, the exact same way, same words..exactly the same..but instead of white, I used black...you would label me a racist white supremacist nazi KKK pos...and you want to talk about how whites shoot up schools and wherever else you said whites do...how about I\u2019m tired of all the dumb blacks who sell heroin and crack all over my city.. how about I\u2019m tired of the dumb blacks who run around in groups, in my city, jumping and beating white people who are alone for no other reason then their white...and you\u2019re the worst type, becuase you\u2019re such a hypocrite that wants to cry and yell that whites are racist, when you spew nothing but racism. The person who see race and racism is everything, is the REAL racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Sir:\n\nYou\u2019re right, The Root shouldn\u2019t make fun of white people. We had no idea you were this fragile, and apologize for all the white tears we caused.\n\nYou are correct that if white people wrote an article making fun of black people the way I and others at The Root make fun of white people, we\u2019d call them racist. But it wouldn\u2019t be because of what you wrote or said. We would object to what you said because it is offensive in combination with how you actually treat black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wanted to clap back at you by saying that unlike your frail, delicate, unseasoned, sallow spirits, black people wouldn\u2019t give a damn what you called us if you treated us equally. But I didn\u2019t want to speak on behalf of everyone at The Root, so I posed this question to the entire staff this morning:\n\nSuppose you were the leader of all the black people in America and you were approached by the leader of all white people [I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s Donald Trump or Taylor Swift] with this proposition: White people could magically erase all inequality, racism, hate, transphobia, homophobia, etc., in the world, but black people would have to agree to one thing: White people would get to address us only as \u201cniggers.\u201d ... Would you accept?\n\nSome immediately agreed to the proposition. Some wondered how we would enforce the agreement, while others didn\u2019t think it would ever work. There was a fierce debate going on until Editor-in-Chief Danielle Belton came in and broke up the conversation and made us get back to work. (And yes, J.M., as we dispersed, she yelled, \u201cMake sure you don\u2019t get pregnant or rob anyone today!\u201d See ... she\u2019s doing her part.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here is my point: Every single person considered it because we don\u2019t give a damn what you call us if you treat us equally! White people are more hurt about some motherfucking articles on a motherfucking website than they are about actual inequality! If that was the only racism black people had to face, we would rejoice.\n\nSo if you only wrote articles about the \u201cdumb blacks\u201d in your city selling heroin (I\u2019m sure it got there on all those black-owned boats and planes) or only wrote about the \u201cdumb blacks\u201d who go around attacking whites, but you eliminated every other form of discrimination and hate, we wouldn\u2019t call you a \u201cracist white supremacist nazi, KKK\u201d piece of shit ...\n\nJust a \u201cpiece of shit.\u201d\n\nFinally, a Twitter direct message:\n\nFrom: Mike Jones\n\nTo: Michael Harriot How does it feel to be one of the biggest racists in America?\n\nI\u2019d like to accept this award on behalf of all the black people who tried their hardest to win this title by simply talking about race. I\u2019d also like to thank some of the past winners, including the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Malcolm X and President Barack Obama, who were all called racists and accused of dividing the country by bringing up the subject of race.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most of all, I\u2019d like to thank my fellow nominees for this year.\n\nTo the white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va.: I know you thought you had it in the bag this year. But just because you brought together every different kind of racist to terrorize a city doesn\u2019t mean you deserve this award. I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cBut we actually killed someone, and Michael Harriot and the staff of The Root have never laid hands on another human being because of their race.\u201d Look, man, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. You just have to work harder next year. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll think of something.\n\nTo Donald Trump: I know you\u2019re over there talking to the panel trying to convince them that there must have been some illegal voting, but let it go. Can\u2019t you see it? We\u2019re more racist than you are. You tried to ban Muslims from entering the country, painted Mexicans as rapists and murderers, and put known white supremacists in your Cabinet. But did you create the term \u201cwypipo\u201d? Did you make jokes about potato salad? No, but we did. Let this be a lesson to you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut let me tell you what makes us the proudest.\n\nIn 1983 Timothy Coggins was seen dancing with a white woman at the People\u2019s Choice nightclub in Griffin, Ga. A few white men got together and kidnapped Coggins. Two of the kidnappers were law enforcement officers. Then they beat him. Then they wrapped a chain around his neck and dragged him for over a mile. But he was still alive.\n\nSo the white men took a knife and stabbed him. They sliced him. They slit him. They took turns. When one of them was too tired, the next man would take over. Then they tied him to a truck again, dragged him a little while longer, then threw him in a ditch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEveryone in town knew who did it because they bragged about the time they killed a nigger and got away with it. One of the killers said he \u201cmissed the good old days when you could kill a black man for no reason.\u201d Another one of them told his wife, \u201cIf you keep on, you\u2019re going to wind up like that nigger in the ditch.\u201d\n\nBut no one told on these men for 34 years. The ones who kept quiet were complicit in the Coggins family\u2019s unending grief. Silence is the most despicable kind of racism there is. I wonder who Coggins\u2019 loved ones hate more: the men who killed Coggins that night, or the ones who knew but didn\u2019t give a damn about their pain and suffering?\n\nBut today I stand before you to tell you that Mike Jones, Tucker Carlson and Fox News viewers everywhere have declared that I and the rest of The Root staff, by poking fun at the flimsy, snowflakelike, thin, pearl skin of America\u2019s ruling class, are more racist than Bill Moore Sr. and Frankie Gebhardt, who allegedly killed Timothy Coggins and left him dying in a ditch, and all the white people who kept the terrible secret for 34 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThank you.", "keywords": ["clapback", "roots", "blacks", "racism", "ok", "racist", "whites", "wrote", "mailbag", "sure", "butthurt", "root", "black", "white", "im"], "polarity": 0.03796901304713804, "subjectivity": 0.39948504764911},

I know this sounds like some Inception-level shit where we make references to a mailbag inside a mailbag about the mailbag, so I will include some new stuff, too.\n\nLast week was a rough week for mail. I feel like you guys weren\u2019t bringing your racist A-game (the \u201ca\u201d stands for asswipe). I had to look for stuff to clap back at. I know it was the day after The Root 100 gala, and I may have awakened in my bed the next morning wearing a tuxedo jacket, formal shoes and no pants. I cannot confirm this, and also ... why are you being so nosy?\n\nLuckily, you guys really stepped up to the hate plate this week. I have received no less than 12 correspondences that contain the word \u201cnigger\u201d in them. While it does show a lack of creativity on the part of racists (400 years and \u201cnigger\u201d is the best you can do?*), it does set a new personal record for me.\n\nBravo, motherfuckers. Bravo.\n\nLet\u2019s read some mail:\n\n\n\n*I prefer the pure simplicity of \u201cporch monkey.\u201d\n\nThe following is a comment on Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan\u2019s article about a hair game, which some (white) people found very offensive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Mike Your just another niggger jealous of white people and pissed because you were born black, I would be to, you blacks snivel about everything and blame everyone else for your woes, but it is you who are to blame for the way people of all races see blacks and the way we see you is justified by the way people of all races see blacks and the way we see you is justified by the way blaks as a whole are, basically lie animals, all races really hate blacks, even blacks hate blacks and kill each other by the hunddreds every day, you wil alwasy be the scum of the earth and rightly so\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMike,\n\nIt is part of human nature to believe that everyone likes the same things and feels the same way you do. If you like a dish, how could anyone else not like it? If a joke makes you laugh, how could anyone else not think it\u2019s funny? The entire staff of The Root still can\u2019t wrap their minds around the idea that, after having tasted bacon, I think it is just \u201ca\u2019ight.\u201d They can\u2019t even process the concept. They have actually come to the conclusion that every time I\u2019ve tried it, it must have been fake bacon. Like there\u2019s an international conspiracy to slip mediocre pork products to Michael Harriot. It\u2019s probably beef lobbyists. Big beef must be behind it* (which, I must add, would be my stripper name). I said all of that to make this point, Mike:\n\nJust because you hate black people doesn\u2019t mean everyone hates black people.\n\nI know the concept is as mind-numbingly implausible as someone\u2019s being apathetic about eating pig thigh meat. I truly understand that so much hate is buried in the rancid, charcoal black muscle you call a heart that you think everyone in the world must obviously have the same despicable disposition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMike, you\u2019re not going to believe me when I say this, but trust me it\u2019s true: Not all white people are racist.\n\nNope. Trust me, it\u2019s true. In fact, I\u2019ll tell you another secret. There are even people in the world (I will admit, they\u2019re probably some kind of lexical geniuses or something) who use periods and all that fancy-schmancy punctuation shit. They even know the difference between \u201cyour\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re.\u201d\n\nNow, I\u2019m going to keep the grammar thing between you and me, because I intend to cite you as a source to every Caucasian crier who says, \u201cNot all white people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThanks, Mike.\n\nThanks,\n\nMike\n\n*That\u2019s what she said.\n\nFrom Twitter user BuildTheWall:\n\nThis comments related to article complaining to whites that bring up black on black crime. You said over 91% of blacks are killed by other blacks & most whites are murdered by other whites & failed to mention that 84% of whites are killed by other whites , blacks commit approximately 50% homicides in the U.S. every year & commit most crime at a much higher ratio / percent of other races. They burn towns / cities & then cry about needing everyone to give them something for free , they take over 35% welfare annually are only 13% - 15% of this nations population & shift the blame saying most welfare goes to whites. They are taught that only white people can be racist in some schools / colleges & this only makes race relations worse. Pointing out facts doesn\u2019t feel good does it? I am no racist & to be honest the world sucks. There will be no end to the shitholes that many poor or unemployed blacks live at in all major cities & poor black areas in general until welfare is cut off for many of them because a large percentage of them don\u2019t need it & just refuse to work like any other race. When you cut off welfare for those that can work & are just sitting home they\u2019ll to get off their asses & find a job. You have no idea how much better life would be for many people if they lost their welfare. I have seen major improvements in attitudes after they started working no matter their skin color. They were scared as hell at first & when they got a job their attitude was much better then when they were relying on welfare because they were able to get an apartment , had money to spend & got out of the shithole they were living in. My girlfriend was one of those black people that relied on welfare because she didn\u2019t want to work. I told her that she was only allowed to eat dollar store soup until she got a job & kept my food which was mainly meat & poultry was in a chest freezer. She left my food alone & found a job in only 1 week . When she got a job she was given a key to the chest freezer & allowed to eat whatever she wanted as long as she mentioned it if I was gone so I could replace it. She was also stuck at home & not able to go out until she got a job. You want to know what she did over it? She was angry at me about it until she got a job & thanked me for making her stay at home because she realized that\u2019s a little like how she was living for years & she no longer feels imprisoned like she was on welfare. She said the job gave her more freedom then she could have imagined & finally has some money to spend because of me. I overheard this when she was talking to a friend because she talks a little loud & th\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is so much to unpack here, so I won\u2019t. Instead, I would like to submit that this isn\u2019t one of the most racist things I\u2019ve ever received, but it is all the racist things I\u2019ve received. If someone wanted to know what kind of hate mail black writers get, this would be my prototype.\n\nIt is excellent in its sheer lack of fucks given about grammar. The way he refers to his arbitrarily derived statistics as \u201cfacts\u201d is baconlike in both taste and saltiness. But you know what my favorite part is? The way, smack dab in the middle of this verbal diarrhea, he says, \u201cI\u2019m no racist.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one of my favorite parts.\n\nI was actually going to include this letter in last week\u2019s mailbag, but last Friday\u2019s bag of bullshit ran pretty long, so I had totally forgotten about the part where he said he had a black girlfriend whom he trained to work and be responsible through a system of starvation and ass-whippings. (I know the DM didn\u2019t say anything about ass whippings, but y\u2019all know. ... You think this guy doesn\u2019t slap women around?) I am also still trying to wrap my head around the fact that an actual woman, with a vagina and everything, let him stick his flaccid, chicken-neck-looking, underdeveloped, thumb-shaped penis inside her. I guess even a trash can catches a steak some days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich brings me to my last point about the worst people on the planet. I know I talk about racism very often, but there is a class of people who are worse than racists: the motherfuckers who put locks on refrigerators.\n\nIf Hitler\u2019s Third Reich had been limited to these motherfuckers, he would have been hailed as a hero. I\u2019ve always heard about these people, but even this brief, momentary contact makes me want to take one of those Silkwood showers where I scrub my skin really hard with a medium-bristle wire brush and then sit on the floor of the shower with my arms wrapped around my legs thinking about the complexities of the human condition and why they don\u2019t make Pop-Tarts without the icing anymore as my tears slowly dissolve down the drain.\n\nSee what I go through for y\u2019all?\n\nThe following are two comments left on last week\u2019s mailbag from a user named Dusty. Dusty was apparently triggered by me saying, \u201cWhite people are evil.\u201d\n\nI like to pop in from time to time to see how other folks view the world who aren\u2019t like me and I have not posted until now. You write that all white people are evil and then try to make a nuanced explanation, but in the end, had a white person said \u201call black people are evil\u201d regardless of the explanation, they would immediately be branded a racist. How do you justify pointing out all the anti-black racism when many comments and articles on this site are anti-white? How do you expect a white person to act when you put your thumb in their eye at every opportunity?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDusty later wrote:\n\nSo you think saying all white people are evil is appropriate? How about all black people are evil?\n\nDearest Dusty,\n\nSorry for putting my thumb in your eye. I\u2019m also sorry that your anus is still so sore from me saying, \u201cWhite people are evil\u201d that you missed the entire point of last week\u2019s mailbag.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd you\u2019re right, by the way. If a white person had said, \u201cAll black people are evil,\u201d I would have assumed they were racist. I probably wouldn\u2019t have typed a letter or comment to the site where they said it, though. I wouldn\u2019t have done it for one particular reason:\n\nIf I were browsing that imaginary site that said, \u201cBlack people are evil,\u201d I bet it would have a million stories on it. I would imagine that it had stories about crime, racism, inequality, injustice, death, satire, politics, pop culture and even achievements. After I perused through all of the other worldviews that are different from mine, the thing I would have been offended by the least (or at least not enough to toggle me into \u201cletter-writing mode\u201d) was someone saying, \u201cBlack people are evil.\u201d Would you like to know why?\n\nBecause I am not evil.\n\nI know it\u2019s hard dealing with the racism against white people. I\u2019ve felt it, too. Last year, while filling out my taxes, I told my son to get his registration so I could see how much I paid to register his car. I walked to the garage with him, and when he fumbled around in the glove compartment searching for the right paper, I yelled at him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wasn\u2019t being mean, but in that moment, all I could think about was, \u201cWhat if the wrong cop was standing over this black kid fumbling around in his glove compartment?\u201d That stupid little moment of teenage carelessness could cost my son his life\u2014because he is black.\n\nIt is a tough thing to wrestle with, watching your children, knowing the more they grow, the more they become prey. It is scary to think about that every time they leave the house. And then I thought, I bet this is just how Dusty feels when he reads words on the internet.\n\nSee? Our battles with racism are the same, Dusty.\n\nBut there is something else in your comments that I\u2019d like to point out:\n\nI said, \u201cWhite people are evil.\u201d\n\nYou asked, \u201cSo you think saying all white people are evil is appropriate?\u201d\n\nYou also wrote, \u201cYou write that all white people are evil and then try to make a nuanced explanation ... \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you notice the difference in those sentences, Dusty?\n\nYou added an \u201call.\u201d I didn\u2019t say \u201call,\u201d Dusty. Thank you for clearing this up for me. Now I understand everything. For so long I\u2019ve been accusing the \u201cnot all white people\u201d crowd of being too sensitive and privileged, but now I understand.\n\nWhite people can\u2019t read!\n\nNow that you\u2019ve pointed it out to me, it\u2019s clear, Dusty! Thank you for that.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying that \u201call\u201d white people are illiterate. Just some. The ones who compare comments on the internet to 400 years of rape, torture, injustice, murder and inequality. The ones so dumb they actually think they can convince people that they are open-minded and sophisticated enough to cruise the internet to hear opinions different from their own, but so sensitive they can\u2019t handle opinions different from their own. The ones so privileged they think they can actually tell people that their opinions aren\u2019t \u201cappropriate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot all white people, Dusty.\n\nJust you.\n\nHey, Mike said it, not me.", "keywords": ["clapback", "evil", "roots", "mailbags", "blacks", "think", "saying", "mailbag", "know", "welfare", "black", "white", "job", "way"], "polarity": -0.06077503969763386, "subjectivity": 0.48780286426729924},

Yes, we\u2019re making it a day of the week. The name \u201cFriday\u201d wasn\u2019t imaginative enough. Plus, it has nothing to do with frying. If they only served fried chicken and french fries, then I\u2019d be cool with the name, but I think the last day before the weekend should be reserved for clapping back.\n\nI\u2019m not just talking about how we here at The Root respond to the hateful tweets, emails or comments; I\u2019m talking about you, too. Why not use this day to clap back at everyone who fucked with you during the week? Send an anonymous note to Sheila in human resources telling her she needs to use better deodorant, if only for the one day you have team meetings. Scream \u201cFuck you\u201d to the mailman who left your packages from Amazon.com in the rain.\n\nLet this be a healing day because the end of the week should be a catharsis so that you can empty out your negative energy and absorb something positive. Because next week is going to be shitty, too. Because haters gonna hate and motherfuckers gonna motherfuck.\n\nBecause clapping back is self-care.\n\nThe following is a Twitter direct message received by staff writer Monique Judge from a reader named Patrick:\n\nSince you \u201csaid what you said\u201d I\u2019ll say what I say too: It\u2019s great and makes sense that Lion King has a predominately black cast. However you making it about race and calling people \u201cpasty faces\u201d how does that make things better? How is it not divisive? Racism is not a one way street-and your angry and hatefully-toned blog posts and replies to comments just go to show that. Racism is not an American problem, it\u2019s a human problem and honestly, minorities in America have it pretty damn good. I\u2019m not saying things are perfect, but please go to any country in the world and by comparison you will see how much more tolerant and accepting people are in the US-byfar. Just like you have nothing to be ashamed of for being black, I don\u2019t have any self-loathing tendencies for being white. It\u2019s just a shame that black people can be openly racist and think it\u2019s only an one-way street, because it\u2019s obvously not. And before you reply some angry and race-based argument about how bad being black is in America and how oppressed you are, please save it. If yo want to talk like an adult and not shout insults at people for being different than you, I\u2019m open to that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Patrick,\n\nFirst of all, Monique is racist.\n\nLet\u2019s get that out of the way. I have spoken to our HR department about her calling white people pasty faces. That\u2019s just wrong. If Monique is using Elmer\u2019s glue as a standard, I think her adjectives are offensive, too. I believe your faces have more of a biscuit-dough complexion. The good biscuits, though. Like Pillsbury or something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, I\u2019d like to thank you and all white people who have the hubris to use the \u201cIt could be worse\u201d argument. It\u2019s like telling a woman who\u2019s been beaten up and left for dead, \u201cWell, at least he didn\u2019t rape you.\u201d\n\nBut I really wanted to get to your main point, Patty. One of the things I\u2019m most confused by is the vast quantity of white people who come to a site about race, read the content and reply, \u201cWhy do you have to make everything about race?\u201d\n\nThat is literally what Monique is paid to do, Pat. Your complaint is akin to someone asking why ESPN doesn\u2019t focus on politics more often. Why does everything have to be about sports over there?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not a technical wizard by any stretch of the imagination, but let me let you in on a bit of advanced computer coding that is hidden in whatever platform you are using to read this: If you look at the top of your screen, there is a small symbol of an arrow pointing left. That is called the \u201cback button.\u201d If you click on it, miraculously you won\u2019t be forced to read Monique\u2019s words. Also, If Monique\u2019s words make you uncomfortable, then good. It\u2019s the job of everyone here to make white people uncomfortable. All white people. Uncomfortable enough to do something. Anything.\n\nSome will not feel uncomfortable at all. They will think to themselves, \u201cI\u2019m not racist, I don\u2019t participate in racism, so I\u2019m not offended by any of this because they\u2019re not talking about me.\u201d\n\nSome of them, in their discomfort, will say, \u201cFuck The Root.\u201d\n\nSome of them will say, \u201cFuck this system; I need to do something about it.\u201d\n\nAnd some, unfortunately, will feel so uncomfortable about their own subconscious racism that in hopes of absolution, they will take the time to direct-message a writer about how black people complain too much about racism as they, themselves, are whining about a motherfucking Disney movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis week, news fellow Anne Branigin wrote this story:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the article appeared, Anne received a boatload of communications. The following letter is representative of them all.\n\nFrom: ABQ\n\nTo: Anne Branigin Why dont you go in as hard on punk hillary the aristocratic bitch that used bubba to imprison millions of poor mostly black men. Or her advocacy of private prisons. And to later imply who blacks should vote for. How about shutting the fuck up bitch. What could your snow white ass come in and tell us collectively whats for our good. Im a bernie or bust voter that voted for trump cause i hated hillary and wanted an end to globalization. 8 years obama had an opportunity to adress criminal justice reform. 8 YEARS!!!!! bottom line before you go out and denounce the only person with guts to advocate for the belitttled and downtrodden do a little inbiased research your self. As a real black person, not some bitch with a platform to talk, i think that hes a ok with me. How about asking a black person before writimg about what we need pr who we feel is that person to advocate for it. It sure wasnt cunt ass hillary\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear ABQ,\n\nFirst of all ... I asked Monique, and she told me that Anne isn\u2019t pasty white or \u201csnow white.\u201d Anne confirmed that while she has seen seven dwarfs, she has never lived with seven of them. Or a prince.\n\nBut I thank you for your letter. I want to explain how this anti-Bernie bias works.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery morning, the writers at The Root compile a list of stories we will write about. Some of them are assigned to us. Some of them are newsworthy events. Some of them are our own ideas. Then we spend the rest of the day reporting, writing about or covering an issue.\n\nNone of us here at The Root are sitting around waiting for a story about Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton to surface so that we can bash either candidate. While we care about politics and how they affect minorities, when it comes to Bernie vs. Hillary, or Chrisette Michelle or most other divisive issues, we try to adhere to a strict journalistic policy known as \u201cnot giving a fuck.\u201d\n\nAnne isn\u2019t sitting around the office rocking back and forth like she\u2019s in a double Dutch competition waiting for a story so she can bash Bernie. She wrote about a quote that Bernie actually said. If you have an issue with what he said or how it was received, you should write an angry email to Bernie Sanders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou should also be aware of one other thing about Bernie Sanders (whom\u2014in the spirit of full disclosure\u2014I confess I voted for in the primaries):\n\nHe motherfucking lost.\n\nI wanted him to win. A lot of black and brown people wanted him to win. But he got his ass whipped. Very few people think that Hillary Clinton is a friend to black people or even unworthy of being called a \u201ccunt ass.\u201d (Although I do question your blackness for using that word. It\u2019s just not a thing for us.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen we write a story that reflects how actual people feel, it\u2019s not meant to be an attack. It just is. Some black and brown people just weren\u2019t down with Bernie like that. Deal with it.\n\nOr not.\n\nWe don\u2019t give a fuck.\n\nFrom: Greg T.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: You\u2019re obsession with white people Why are you so racist against white people. I think you are a good writer, but you take every opportunity to down white people. Your anti-white jokes aren\u2019t even funny anymore. Some white people don\u2019t care about race. It is people like you who are so obsessed with everything white people do or say who keep racism alive. Just like some white people need to get to know black people, you need to get to know some non-racist whites. Most white people are good people who want the same thing in life like everybody black. Sure there are some racists, but they are a small minority of white people. You need to stop focusing on them and find some non-racist white friends.

But President Trump, whose proven himself to be the pettiest of bitches, commanded his personal top cop Jeff \u201cKing Keebler\u201d Sessions to fire McCabe.\n\n\n\nSessions waited until just before 10 p.m. to announce that McCabe, who would\u2019ve been eligible for his full pension in just one day, was going to be terminated, because the Trump administration is nothing if not dramatic.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, McCabe stepped down from his second in command post at the FBI earlier this year, but was still employed and was still fighting to keep his job as recently as Thursday. The Post notes that McCabe spent some four hours inside the Justice Department pleading his case.\n\nBut, like Simba\u2019s uncle Scar before him, Trump has proven himself to be an evil bitch. He just couldn\u2019t let McCabe bow out with his money. Nope, he just had to knee-cap him on his way out the door.\n\nThe Post notes that McCabe\u2019s firing comes after a general investigation found that he \u201cauthorized the disclosure of sensitive information to the media about a Clinton-related case, then misled investigators about his actions in the matter, people familiar with the matter have said.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cConsidering McCabe\u2019s number of years at the agency and estimations of his high-level pay grade, formulas published by the US Office of Personnel Management for law enforcement officers show that his yearly payout could hit in the area of $60,000 each year, if McCabe were to retire after his birthday on Sunday,\u201d CNN reports.\n\n\n\nThe Post reports that McCabe can seek legal action to try and get his pension wages, but good luck with that. McCabe spent 20 years with the FBI and his tenure ends just days before he could have bowed out quietly.\n\nIn my best Joanne the Scammer voice I say, \u201cTrump is a messy bitch who lives for drama\u201d so much so that he couldn\u2019t wait to hop on Twitter at midnight to gloat over McCabe\u2019s firing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this is the president that 53% of white women voted against their own self-interst to put in office and so far he\u2019s doing a stellar job, assuming of course that his job is to guide America into the fiery pits of hell.", "keywords": ["mccabe", "office", "president", "trump", "pension", "fires", "mad", "mccabes", "post", "spent", "director", "screwing", "job", "petty", "proven", "fbi", "retire"], "polarity": 0.12170781893004115, "subjectivity": 0.42366255144032927},

They report on a controversial dossier that said Trump hired prostitutes to defile space where the American president and first lady had slept.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPutin and his inner circle had nothing but utter contempt for Obama and his administration \u2014 much of it cast in racist terms,\u201d Isikoff and Corn write in \u201cRussian Roulette: : The Inside Story of Putin\u2019s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cPutin and his top advisers routinely denigrated Obama and his national security team as \u2018weak\u2019 and \u2018indecisive\u2019 \u2014 and then, contradictorily, blamed him for meddling in Russia\u2019s internal affairs. In Putin\u2019s presence, Obama would be called a \u2018monkey,\u2019 and it was not uncommon for the American president to be referred to as the N-word.\u201d\n\nThe book has been No. 1 on the Amazon best-sellers list for the past two days, Brian Stelter reported Wednesday for his \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCorn and Isikoff continued, \u201cThe small number of U.S. officials privy to the reports from this source wondered if Putin and his crew truly viewed Obama in such crude terms. But the source\u2019s credibility was bolstered by a recent episode.\n\n\u201cMonths earlier, Irina Rodnina, a Russian figure skater, posted a racist tweet showing a doctored photo of Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama looking like monkeys and admiring a banana. The U.S. Embassy lodged a protest, and Rodnina claimed on Twitter that her account had been hacked. When the Sochi Olympics opened, Putin selected Rodnina, a member of his United Russia Party in the Duma, as one of two Russian athletes to light the Olympic torch. This seemed like a not-too-veiled message. . . . \u201c\n\n\u201cRussian Roulette,\u201d released Tuesday and accompanied by a blizzard of media appearances by its authors, repeats information from a dossier put together by the former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele. Steele had headed Britain\u2019s intelligence Russia desk, then started his own private investigative agency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuoting the dossier, the authors write, \u201cSource D, described as \u2018a close associate of TRUMP who had organized and managed his recent trips to Moscow,\u2019 claimed that \u2018TRUMP\u2019s (perverted) conduct in Moscow included hiring the presidential suite of the Ritz Carlton Hotel, where he knew President and Mrs. OBAMA (whom he hated) had stayed on one of their official trips to Russia, and defiling the bed where they had slept by employing a number of prostitutes to perform a \u2018golden showers\u2019 (urination) show in front of him. . . .\u201d\n\nThe Steele dossier was published in full in January 2017 by BuzzFeed, which stated that the claims were all unsubstantiated and unverified but deserved to be made public. Other media outlets accused BuzzFeed of being irresponsible. However, the material in the dossier was said to have been shown to both Trump and Obama.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe authors write that Susan Rice, Obama\u2019s national security adviser, had encouraged James Clapper, director of national intelligence, during the daily intelligence briefing to tell Obama about the \u201cgolden showers\u201d allegation.\n\n\u201cObama turned to Rice and said, \u2018Why am I hearing this?\u2019 He was incredulous,\u201d Isikoff and Corn write. \u201c \u2018What\u2019s happening?\u2019 he asked. Rice said the intelligence community had no idea if this story was true but that Obama needed to be aware the allegation was circulating. \u2018You don\u2019t really expect to hear the term \u201cgolden showers\u201d in the President [cq] Daily Brief,\u2019 a participant in this meeting later said, \u2018or that the guy who is going to become president may be a Manchurian candidate.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nThe reporters also write, \u201cWhen [Vice President Joseph P.] Biden was briefed about intelligence reports on the connections between various players in the Trump orbit and the Kremlin, he had a visceral reaction. \u2018If this is true,\u2019 he exclaimed, \u2018it\u2019s treason.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRussian Roulette\u201d has a larger focus than Obama and race, as Steven Lee Myers wrote in a review published Wednesday by the New York Times. Myers notes that its \u201csubtitle promises to reveal \u2018the inside story of Putin\u2019s war on America and the election of Donald Trump,\u2019 but adds, \u201cAlas, it does not \u2014 at least so far as offering foolproof evidence of Putin\u2019s involvement, or his motives.\u201d\n\nStill, an excerpt published in Mother Jones touches on Trump\u2019s posture toward women of color. The setting is a 2013 visit to Moscow to support the Miss Universe pageant, which he owned.\n\n\u201cFrequently, Trump would toss out finalists and replace them with others he preferred. \u2018If there were too many women of color, he would make changes,\u2019 a Miss Universe staffer later noted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnother Miss Universe staffer recalled, \u2018He often thought a woman was too ethnic or too dark-skinned. He had a particular type of woman he thought was a winner. Others were too ethnic. He liked a type. There was Olivia Culpo, Dayanara Torres [the 1993 winner], and, no surprise, East European women.\u201d On occasion, according to this staffer, Trump would reject a woman \u2018who had snubbed his advances.\u2019\n\n\u201cOnce in a while,\u201d Paula Shugart, the president of the Miss Universe Organization, \u201c would politely challenge Trump\u2019s choices. Sometimes she would win the argument, sometimes not. \u2018If he didn\u2019t like a woman because she looked too ethnic, you could sometimes persuade him by telling him she was a princess and married to a football player,\u2019 a staffer later explained. . . .\u201d\n\nPhilip Bump, Washington Post: 4.4 million 2012 Obama voters stayed home in 2016 \u2014 more than a third of them black\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid Corn and Michael Isikoff, Mother Jones: \u201cWhy the Hell Are We Standing Down?\u201d (book excerpt)\n\n\n\nDavid Corn and Michael Isikoff, Mother Jones: What Happened in Moscow: The Inside Story of How Trump\u2019s Obsession With Putin Began (book excerpt)\n\n\n\nJarvis DeBerry, NOLA.com | Times-Picayune: Steve Scalise\u2019s bizarre claim that Donald Trump\u2019s been tough on Russia\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeff Jacoby, Boston Globe: Deval Patrick for president?

Then came a loud pop as a bullet went right through Courtlin\u2019s heart, ending her life way too short of adulthood.\n\n\u2018 \u2018The last thing I told them was \u201cI love you\u201d and have a blessed day at school,\u2019 Courtlin\u2019s mom, Tynesha Tatum, who has another son and daughter in the same high school, told the Birmingham News. \u2018That was at 7:45 a.m\u2026At 3:45 p.m., I got a call that my baby got shot.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOn Wednesday, Courtlin\u2019s schoolmates \u2014 her murder still ringing in their ears \u2014 are planning to walk out of school and protest the lack of safety for teenagers trying to grow up in the most gun-crazed nation on the planet. [They did so.] If you follow the news, it\u2019s almost certain that you\u2019ve already heard about the National School Walkout Day, which has become \u2014 rightfully so \u2014 a huge story from coast to coast. But it\u2019s almost a lock that you haven\u2019t heard at all about the loss of Courtlin Arrington.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t Parkland, Florida, where the mass shooting of 17 kids in the upscale Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School upended the world of students who\u2019d been raised to expect the best things in life \u2014 and thus triggered a social revolution that is only starting to grow. No, Courtlin Arrington was killed by a handgun inside Huffman High School in Birmingham, Ala., in the kind of struggling urban district where kids have grown all too accustomed to hardship, even to violence.\n\n\u201cEven so, it was somewhat shocking that a shooting inside a school classroom received virtually no national coverage . . .\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOf course, one death may seem less impactful than one of the 10 largest mass shootings in U.S. history, but tell that to Courtlin\u2019s classmates who will be traumatized by the sound of that fatal gunshot for the rest of their lives. There\u2019s no definitive way to know how much of the ignoring of her story was simply fatigue, in a nation where gun deaths remain off the charts, and how much is because both Courtlin and her alleged killer are African-Americans. . . .\u201d\n\nJenice Armstrong, Philadelphia Daily News: We must all support Wednesday\u2019s student walkout to toughen gun laws\n\nJarvis DeBerry, NOLA.com | Times-Picayune: New Orleans students to demand gun control in National School Walkout\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditorial, Baltimore Sun: Student walkout: Protest has a price\n\n\n\nEditorial, Buffalo News: In support of the student walkout\n\n\n\nEditorial, Chicago Sun-Times: In Chicago, 79 dead of guns so far this year.

Niggers like you are why black people can\u2019t get anywhere. First you wrote that piece of trash about Doug Jones flyer, then you bash the democratic party. Your always bashing Hillary and democrats, because you and the rest rest of the Bernie bros are still mad that she beat him FAIR AND SQUARE!!!! You at the reason Trump won. I bet you voted for him, but even if you didn\u2019t you spent so much time bashing Hillary that you paved the way for him. You don\u2019t even realize that the republicans don\u2019t mena black people no good. Every time you bash the democrats,you\u2019re helping them. You might as well be the KKK.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019re right, Starr. You figured it out. I\u2019m the reason Hillary lost.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that she took states in the Rust Belt for granted. It wasn\u2019t that she called black people \u201csuperpredators.\u201d It wasn\u2019t because she has such a long history of underhanded shenanigans that President Barack Obama\u2019s voters felt no enthusiasm for her. It wasn\u2019t that she popped up at black churches and barbershops pandering to black people with the see-through bullshittery of how one of her best friends from college \u201cis African American.\u201d\n\nIt was me the whole time.\n\nHad I been \u201cwith her,\u201d she would\u2019ve won because I would\u2019ve told her ass to stop cheating so much. I would have told her not to try to rig the primaries. I would have told the Democratic Party to stop assuming they had the black vote by default. I would have told her to put something about black lives and police brutality in her platform before Black Lives Matter literally forced her to do it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI would have told her to stop lying and fainting. I would have given her something better to wear than pastel-colored karate suits. I would have told her to stop warmongering and nation building. And lying. And fainting. I would have asked her why the fuck was she so moderate? I would have asked her why she was chasing white voters like they owed her $20. I would have made her secure the bag.\n\nMost importantly, had I been with her, I never would have made her, Doug Jones, the Democratic Party or any other white person on the face of the earth into a savior.\n\nThe reason they treat black people like shit is that too many of us believe that just because Hillary, Doug or any other Democrat is slightly better than a Republican, we should be afraid to publicly criticize them. The Democratic Party is the proverbial plantation from which black people are afraid to run because our massa is slightly more benevolent than the other slave owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am sorry Donald Trump is president, but I am not sorry that Hillary Clinton is not my president.\n\nFuck her.\n\nI do not want a slightly better slave master.\n\nI want to be free.\n\nHere\u2019s an email from a Bernie Sanders supporter:\n\n\n\nFrom: Karla P.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Bernie would of won. I loved your piece on the Cornel West feud. I just have one thing to say about your criticism of Bernie Sanders. I know the black community was pulling for Hillary because we blindly vote for whichever Democrat they give us, but her record shows that she was never going to do anything for us. She didn\u2019t do anything for us as a Senator. She didn\u2019t take a stand for us during her husband\u2019s presidency or during her campaign. What you don\u2019t realize about Bernie is that he has been fighting for us since the civil rights movement. Our allegiance to the Democratic party is what kills us politically because they take our votes for granted. The only way our votes will ever matter is if we make politicians earn it. If not for people like you Constantly kissing Hillary\u2019s ass and downing candidates like Bernie, he would of won. Stop leading your people like sheep to the slaughter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHey, Karla!\n\nThank you so much for your kind words in the first paragraph. As for the second part of your email\u2014I\u2019m sorry you feel that way.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, Karla: I am a fan of Bernie Sanders. I want to meet him one day and shake his old, wrinkled hand because I bet it feels like grabbing a pack of hot dogs wrapped in a silk handkerchief. I know it would probably give me the heaves, but I just want to see how it feels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for Bernie as a candidate? He lost, boo. You and the rest of his supporters can stop crying those socialist Democrat white tears any day now. Let that shit go! I know you think Hillary rigged the race, and so do I. But you know what? That\u2019s your fault. What the fuck is wrong with you that you sided with the one white motherfucker on the planet with too much integrity to cheat?\n\nI\u2019m why Bernie lost?\n\nOld man Sanders lost because he brought a rusty-ass, antique knife to a gunfight. I wish politics were more honest, but as long as they aren\u2019t, I want someone who\u2019s willing to slit throats, not some decrepit, counterfeit do-gooder in a J.C. Penney\u2019s suit! Do you know what would have happened if Bernie were in office? The Republican majority in the House and Senate would have eaten him alive and spit him out. Because\u2014and I\u2019m just guessing here\u2014he tastes like a sixth-grade social studies test boiled in hot dog water.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think the only hope for American politics is a true third-party candidate, so I feel no allegiance to the Democratic or Republican Party. I vote for the candidate I want to win, and 99.9 percent of the time, that candidate is a Democrat.\n\nI liked many of Bernie\u2019s ideas and political theories. But I like them in the same way I like the idea of eating a box of hot Krispy Kreme doughnuts while sitting courtside at the Staples Center during Game 7 of the NBA Finals as Lonzo Ball passes the ball to the newly signed LeBron James, who hits the game-winning shot for the Lakers. And as I\u2019m being hugged by Beyonc\u00e9, I barely have time to high-five Colin Kaepernick and congratulate him on his new job as the starting quarterback of the Carolina Diddies before Rihanna taps me on the shoulder and asks me if I want to go to the bathroom and hit the blunt with her, but I can\u2019t ... because you know how my wife gets mad because Rihanna is always sweatin\u2019 me, and I don\u2019t want to argue in the helicopter on the way home.\n\nA Bernie Sanders presidency is as unlikely as that scenario.\n\nKrispy Kreme donuts are trash. Also, I hate the way you\u2019ve just spelled \u201cdoughnuts.\u201d \u2014Yesha\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext are a series of direct messages from a Trump supporter on Twitter named Robert O. You probably wouldn\u2019t be able to understand them, but because I\u2019ve corresponded with so many low-IQ white people since I\u2019ve begun my stint at The Root, I have become fluent in the \u201calt-right\u201d dialect of English. Each one of these is actually a separate message.\n\n\n\nUr a duck\n\nI think he means \u201ccuck,\u201d which is short for \u201ccuckold,\u201d a man who likes to watch other men have sex with their wives. It\u2019s a popular term for people on the alt-right to use against other white men who aren\u2019t as racist as them. Some white people believe that if they aren\u2019t racist enough, they won\u2019t be able to stop the impending black-penis attack that \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d are planning.\n\nCuck\n\nSee, I told you.\n\nAnd a beta male\n\nA beta male is a weak man, not like a strong alpha male. Or maybe he thinks I pledged a white fraternity. Are betas a thing? Can they step?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis one I\u2019m not too sure about.\n\nUr politics are garbage\n\nWe use \u201ctrash\u201d now, Robert.\n\nBy the way, I just looked at your name, and it is one of the few names that are equidistant from both the center of blackness and whiteness. \u201cRobert\u201d isn\u2019t a black name or a white name. It\u2019s just a name. It\u2019s a manly name, though. Roberts probably work hard all day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI often try to imagine what people do just from their names and the letters they write, and I bet you wear gloves to work, Robert. You\u2019re probably employed on a highway crew or cutting meat behind the glass at a grocery store. Yeah, butcher is definitely a \u201cRobert\u201d job. You don\u2019t find many Roberts in the baking or choreographer industries. But I digress ...\n\nUr view all trump supporters are nazis is garbage\n\nThanks for helping my argument, Rob.\n\nAnd ur articles are trash\n\nThat\u2019s fair. See, I told you \u201ctrash\u201d sounds much better!\n\nYou\u2019re welcome!\n\nBlack women are ashy white women are bitchy Asian women eat cats and Hispanic women have fat asses we all have stereotypes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait, Rob, that\u2019s your list of stereotypes? I feel like you could use some help in the stereotyping department. I don\u2019t want to sound racist, but you\u2019re missing out on some good ones.\n\nAll you have for black women is that they\u2019re ashy? Also, are you sure you want to give the \u201cfat asses\u201d to Hispanic women? I would never impugn your racist credentials, but I feel like, statistically speaking ...\n\nYou know what? Imma let you have this one.\n\nSo stop being a faggot\n\nBut I thought I was a cuck? You\u2019re confusing me, Rob. Am I an amphibious bird, the husband of an adulteress or a bundle of sticks? Make up your mind! And why are you on Twitter so much? Those yellow lines aren\u2019t going to paint themselves!\n\nAnd ban me from twitter u west coast lookin. Bitch\n\nWait ... I can do that?\n\nAnd, finally, from a supporter of ... umm, white people?\n\n\n\nFrom: Mitch There\u2019s no need to take sole credit for the Black Community, Michael. Yes they contributed mightily, but so did the media, thousands of volunteers, women, college-age voters (check the campus-town votes), Republicans who refused to vote, Richard Shelby (the write-in votes alone would have made up the difference) and a shit candidate. Happy to see it all working. Let\u2019s keep it all energized for high voter turnout in 2018 and 2020. Identity politics spells losses. It\u2019s wins that count, not credit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of clapping back at Mitch, I\u2019d like to critique and highlight some of my favorite parts of this Twitter direct message.\n\nThe part about how \u201cthere\u2019s no need to take sole credit for the Black Community\u201d is good, because it insinuates that there was another community that voted for Doug Jones. White women voted for Roy Moore. White men voted for Roy Moore. Black men and women voted for Doug Jones. But history shows us that when a white person tells you \u201cthere\u2019s no need\u201d for something, they are about to steal that shit.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s another good part: \u201cYes they contributed mightily but ... \u201d Always remember that everything after the word \u201cbut\u201d is always a lie.\n\nThen there\u2019s the part where he credits \u201cthe media ... volunteers, women, college-age voters ... \u201d Again, he\u2019s white-peopleing. If he extrapolated the statistical data using this thing called \u201cmath\u201d and applied it to college-age voters, he\u2019d see that white college students voted for Roy Moore. The same is true for the campus towns, women, people named \u201cNancy,\u201d people who like hot sauce instead of honey mustard and even praise dancers. This white boy just cannot give black people their due!\n\nWait ... did this motherfucker just say, \u201cRepublicans who refused to vote\u201d? REPUBLICANS WHO REFUSED TO VOTE? He\u2019s so desperate in his white-mannery that he thinks Republicans who didn\u2019t vote are the same as the black people who caused the biggest political upset since Philip \u201cUncle Phil\u201d Banks was elected to a district court judgeship on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. According to Mitch, here\u2019s who should share the glory (in no particular order): black people who voted, white people who overwhelmingly voted for the guy who lost, people doing their motherfucking jobs and white people who did abso-fucking-lutely nothing. That might be the whitest thing ever said, but you gotta admit: It\u2019s a damn good part.\n\nYou might not have noticed the part where he said: \u201cLet\u2019s keep it all working.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s\u201d as in \u201clet us.\u201d You think Mitch has some black people in his pocket? Who the fuck is the \u201cus\u201d? You think I don\u2019t know the old Caucasian \u201cwe won\u201d trick, Mitch? I liked that part, though. If only for its sliminess.\n\nBut my favorite part? The part where this glib stool sample of alabaster arrogance said: \u201cIdentity politics spells losses. It\u2019s wins that count, not credit.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoy Moore appealing to white voters wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d Talking about protecting Confederate monuments wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d Acting as if the Lord and Savior Jesus Harrison Christ commanded those who believeth in him to vote for Moore wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d Doug Jones mailing a racist-adjacent flyer with a black man bug-a-booing on the front like a new-millennium Sambo wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019 repeated invocation of the names of the four little girls killed in the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church every time he got in front of black people, as if those victims gave him a political endorsement, wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d\n\nBut me pointing out the statistical fact that black people were the only group who supported Jones, while white people from Alabama acted like white people from Alabama always do, but they now want credit for some shit they didn\u2019t do ... I\u2019m the one playing \u201cidentity politics.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s one of my favorite parts.", "keywords": ["clapback", "roots", "told", "vote", "politics", "wasnt", "mailbag", "black", "identity", "women", "voted", "title", "insert", "white", "bernie", "clever"], "polarity": 0.0626698244677697, "subjectivity": 0.450799465628233},

As we close out 2017, we would like to thank our haters because we don\u2019t know where we\u2019d be without you. (Actually, we do know where we\u2019d be without you. We\u2019d be fractionally happier, I\u2019d probably have a better relationship with Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan, and the writers at The Root wouldn\u2019t have a faint sense of dread every time they open an email.)\n\nBut without you, none of this would have been possible. I\u2019d probably have to spend my Friday mornings doing something besides conjuring up the spirit of Ric Flair, so from all of us to all of you, we offer a sincere thumbs-up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe finger in the middle is the thumb, right?\n\nOur first selection pertains to a piece that serves as a yearly divining rod for white tears: the 2017 Wypipo Awards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst this comment from Iceseller:\n\nHey look everyone. The racist in chief of this racist blog wrote something racist again! How edgy. Fuck off you racist piece of shit. Maybe 2018 will see you fired and have to be racist somewhere else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis email from the cleverly named U. R. Gay:\n\nFrom U.R. Gay\n\nTo: Michael Harriot What If a white person wrote something the 2017 nigger awards you would call them a racist. You are a world-class racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this comment from Kodimah:\n\nImagine being so race obsessed you write a satiric column about another race thinking you aren\u2019t a gigantic racist yourself. Sad.\n\nDearest Iceseller, Mr. or Ms. Gay, and Kodimah:\n\nFirst of all, I would like to thank Iceseller for pre-emptively naming me to the position of \u201cracist in chief,\u201d but as a firm believer in democracy, I cannot, in good conscience, accept the title without a vote of some kind. While your admiration for me is appreciated, there are candidates far more qualified who could serve in this position.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTake the aforementioned Mr. Gay, for instance (I don\u2019t want to gender-profile anyone, but I\u2019m going to go ahead and assume that U.R. Gay is a guy). He seems like a perfect nominee for the position. He said that I am a \u201cworld-class racist,\u201d which means he has apparently traveled the world ranking them. I would think that he would be a better fit to serve as the king of all racists.\n\nBut I\u2019d like to push this conversation forward by pointing out something that seems obvious to me but has obviously flown over the heads of some of our readers. The Root is a publication that covers black America. Racism against black people is a problem in America. We write about it. We are no more obsessed with race than Deadspin is obsessed with sports, The Takeout is obsessed with food, Jalopnik is obsessed with cars or Jezebel is obsessed with the fact that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote. It is literally my job to talk about race.\n\nI think Kodimah put it best when he or she said: \u201cImagine being so race obsessed you write a satiric column about another race thinking you aren\u2019t a gigantic racist yourself. Sad.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet me explain what white privilege is:\n\nImagine living in a building with a sniper waiting outside. Imagine that, every day, the sniper shot someone who was exiting your building. Sometimes the sniper was in full sight, and other days the sniper was hidden, but he kept shooting at the people who lived in the building as they walked out.\n\nWhite privilege is the ability to say, \u201cYeah, but people in other buildings get shot, too.\u201d White privilege is the penchant for residents of safer buildings to ask why you don\u2019t just move out of the building. White privilege is being able to say, \u201cYeah, snipers exist, but you can\u2019t worry about them all the time.\u201d But most of all, white privilege is the oblivious idiocy of standing on the sidewalk and asking someone who could be killed by a sniper at any minute, \u201cWhy are you so obsessed with snipers?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow imagine reading a piece of satire written by a resident of the building, making fun of snipers. There is only one reason that I can surmise why anyone would be more angry at the person making jokes about snipers than they were at actual snipers:\n\nBecause they are a sniper, too.\n\nKodimah is right.\n\nIt is sad.\n\nFrom: Stephanie\n\nTo: The Root Staff The Root, I\u2019ve been a supporter for a long time. The fact that Skip Gates is a founder spoke to me about your integrity. Lately, I\u2019ve seen way too much cussing and specifically F bombs in your posts.\n\nIt\u2019s not cute. It\u2019s not funny. It\u2019s vulgar and common.\n\nIt\u2019s BENEATH you. As professional journalists and editors, if you must cuss to get your point across, you\u2019re in the wrong profession. Tired of it,\n\nStephanie\n\nStephanie, I get your point. I really do.\n\nMy mother is a wise woman and she, too, was a writer. When I was a kid, she forbade us from using vulgar language, including calling someone a \u201cdog,\u201d a \u201cliar\u201d or \u201cstupid.\u201d She only had two exceptions:\n\nif we were telling a story and the person in the story said the vulgar word or phrase if we could make a logical case why the word was necessary\n\nThose rules are basically the same rules to which we adhere at The Root. I know I have a foul mouth, and I am often asked by the editors and copy editors if a certain word is necessary. Sometimes they change those words without even asking me. I don\u2019t even have a problem with that because I know I can be hyperbolic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if you are a regular reader of The Root, then you know we use a million creative insults, euphemisms and allusions to replace dirty words. I reject the idea that there are \u201cbad words\u201d or that using vulgar language is a sign of a lack of intelligence, and here is why:\n\nSome people are motherfuckers.\n\nThere is a difference between not giving a darn and not giving a fuck. Knocking the crap out of a person is different from slapping the shit out of someone. Sometimes the words you consider to be boorish are the ones that perfectly describe a situation or thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRacism, homophobia, discrimination and Donald Trump are vulgar. Tamping down the description of those things by playing lexical dodgeball with the vocabulary to preserve the pearls that our readers may clutch is not our job.\n\nA few days ago I wrote a story about a Sacramento, Calif., policeman named John Tennis who had a habit of trying to hit black suspects with his car. He shot multiple black people and killed at least two. Even his fellow police officers said that he often discharged his weapon when it wasn\u2019t necessary. Raheem Hosseini of the Sacramento News and Review wrote a puff piece about him that made him into a sympathetic figure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could have called them both colostomy bags filled with racism and prejudice. I could have used flowery language to explain how Tennis exemplified the persistent deadly threat posed by men whose uniforms have become a license to cosplay as executioners. I probably could have blistered Hosseini as an entitled equivocator who uses black lives as a stepladder to get closer to the spotlight while using his pen to blot out the bloodstains of the slaughtered innocent. But no ...\n\nFuck those guys.\n\nWhenever we write about Umar Johnson, we get a lot of email from his followers. Here are three:\n\nA direct Twitter message from Kwesi X:\n\nDear sir, I am from overseas and would like to let you know how sick you make me. Why you\u2019ve spent all your time gunning for Dr umar I\u2019ll never know I just want u to answer, How many kids u council? How many people u visited in jail to do free speaking events? Even if u don\u2019t like umar if u really a journalist of credibility you would have presented a balanced article not a I hate umar hit story. You are a fake black owned company that is simply marketed to black people. But your not really helping are you? Just making money on the drama You should be ashamed of yourself\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd these tweets:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear sirs,\n\nFirst of all, no one who is originally from outside the country says that he is \u201cfrom overseas.\u201d I don\u2019t believe you. You need more Hotep people.\n\nI admit that I am conflicted about using the word \u201cHotep\u201d as a derogatory term because I know the history of the word, but I will also confess that when I was assigned the Umar story, I thought, \u201cHere come the Hoteppers.\u201d I am also tired of writing about Umar Johnson, but I think it is my responsibility. I don\u2019t hate Johnson\u2019s message of \u201cblack consciousness,\u201d any more than I hate the bullshit of prosperity gospel, except for one fact:\n\nHe steals from black people.\n\nLet me be clear:\n\nI believe that black people should know their history. I believe that our connection to our ancestors is important. I believe that there should be a school for black boys with an African-centered education. I desperately hope that someone builds one. I hope there comes a day when there is one in every city and black children can learn how the great Greek philosophers had to go to Africa to get their knowledge, and how the noble, ancient Europeans were bitch-slapped by the Moors and learned agriculture, irrigation, science and astronomy from dark people. One day someone will come with a plan to build and fund this dream.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen that day comes, there will be people who say, \u201cI would donate, but the last time I gave money to something like this, a charlatan who claimed to be a descendant of Frederick Douglass conned me out of my coins.\u201d They will remember how he answered his phone while it was ringing and puffed up his chest whenever anyone asked him to show his Ph.D. People will recall how he publicly preached about the black family while fucking exotic dancers on the low-low. Some will bring up the fact that the last guy who was going to build a school would never show the receipts for how he spent the money.\n\nUmar Johnson\u2019s antics actually make it harder to build this school. If anyone ever achieves the goal of making this a reality, it will be in spite of Umar Johnson, not because of him.\n\nAnd we are not anti-Umar. When everyone doubted Johnson\u2019s degree, it was The Root that spent money to verify his Ph.D. and end the speculation. I am the one who spent days combing through yearbooks and graduation programs hoping that he was legitimate. When I found the evidence, I admitted that I was wrong. In. The. Headline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am also the one who has refused to shade him even as I am constantly contacted by people in and outside the \u201cconscious movement\u201d who claim to have personal knowledge that always turns out to be spurious because they have a beef with Johnson.\n\nNo one here hates Umar Johnson.\n\nWe just like the truth.", "keywords": ["clapback", "awards", "roots", "racist", "umar", "old", "mailbag", "know", "dont", "word", "cusswords", "sniper", "obsessed", "root", "black", "white", "friend"], "polarity": -0.019970001889644755, "subjectivity": 0.5327755247398107},

I think someone slipped a headache into my drink last night at The Root 100 gala. It\u2019s either a hangover or I have sudden-onset brain cancer. That\u2019s not a thing, is it?\n\nOr maybe it was Social Media Editor Corey Townsend screaming the lyrics to Cardi B\u2019s \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d at me. Can I call the police? I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s a hate crime. Or terrorism. Or white supremacy.\n\nAnyway, there are many people who doubt the veracity of some of the mailbag letters because they apparently don\u2019t think people could be so shitty in real life. There are some who think the hate letters, emails and tweets we receive are from people who are trolling because they want to be featured in the mailbag. Some people even think we fabricate the letters and this whole \u201cmailbag\u201d thing is a ruse.\n\nNah, nigga. This shit is real.\n\nIn fact, this week, instead of hate mail, let\u2019s just look at some actual comments from the site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is an actual comment \u201cMadril\u201d left on a story about a caf\u00e9 that refused to give candy to black kids on Halloween:\n\nSome of you will take this the wrong way because AA or Black Americans have been conditioned to be the victim in America. It is understandable that the psychological damage due to slavery, Jim Crow and Segregation still pervades the mind of many African Americans. Moreover, the Black Elites who are taking their cues from the White Liberal Elite and Democratic Leadership are also continuing to push the premise of Black Victimization and White Supremacy. The reality is that the cafe has the right not to give Black kids candy. It is their cafe. The same way you have the right to open a cage next door that will compete against this \u201cracist cafe.\u201d Or the right not to shop at that cafe. The only way to gain your respect is to build your own and stop complaining about racism. The fact is there are no government institutions in the USA in 2017 that will block African American or Black Americans from starting a competing cafe or any other business for that matter. Yes there are individual people who are racists, but that will never change.What needs to change is the victim attitude and playing the race card. The race card is lame and no one is listening or cares cause our community is not respected. America is the greatest country for economic opportunity and mobility. Plan and work harder and smarter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMadril,\n\nI don\u2019t know how to tell you this in a tactful way, so I will just go ahead and say it because you aren\u2019t aware of the truth behind this statement:\n\nWhite people are evil.\n\nAfter reading your bullshit reasoned explanation, I was hesitant about making such a broad generalization. I even deleted and rewrote the sentence a few times. Then I realized that someone had to tell Madril. Maybe it should be me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore you get upset about me painting white people with such a broad brush, I want you to know that I don\u2019t think all white people are evil. According to my rough calculations, the percentage of evil white people is about the same as the ratio of poisonous snakes or venomous spiders to their respective populations overall. Now, I could take a course in herpetology and learn how to differentiate the killer snakes from the harmless ones, but just to be safe, I don\u2019t fuck with snakes.\n\nI know you don\u2019t want to think your people are evil, Madril. Neither do I. At first I tried to convince myself that maybe it was just Madril. Maybe Satan ejaculated into a shitbag of a human being who just happened to be ovulating, and 13 months later, out popped Madril (I think there is a longer gestation period for tiny pieces of toilet asswipe clotted with dried remnants of day-old diarrhea manifested in human form. I\u2019m pretty sure I read that in a medical journal), but then I thought, \u201cNah ... it\u2019s white people.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not your fault, Madril. You were enabled by your evil peers. I doubt that you are even aware of your evilness. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure of it. I\u2019m not shocked that you actually sat down and wrote a letter that used free-market economics to rationalize literally taking candy from babies\u2014any evil individual could do that. But you sent it to someone, Madril! The fact that you released it into the wild for all the world to see is proof that your people have normalized it until you are unaware of how vile you are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though you are a trash human being, don\u2019t despair. There is always room in this world for demons like you. I mean, it was your people who came up with the idea to combine two of the most despicable activities and ruin the world by simultaneously raping and pillaging. You used white-people-ing economics to justify colonization, genocide and the trans-Atlantic slave trade, so why not use it to explain how you fucked over babies who just wanted to trick-or-treat?\n\nSo go out there and keep shitting on toddlers, Madril. Keep on tricking. Keep on injecting poison into the world.\n\nMake your people proud.\n\nThis comment from \u201cSweetJamesJones\u201d is from The Root staffer Danielle Young\u2019s (I don\u2019t know her title, but I think it\u2019s either \u201cdope person\u201d or \u201cexecutive in charge of making fun of that one time Michael Harriot had on too much lip balm\u201d) brave article this week about her experience with famous men:\n\nAs a guy, I just want to say that this is tough. I want to be clear that the guys who did this stuff was wrong, but men are left in a Catch-22. I\u2019m sure I will be eviscerated, but here goes the reasoning. First, a lot of women love that type of attention. They feel it is complimentary, and it makes them feel wanted. Maybe all women are uncomfortable and not saying anything, but that\u2019s highly unlikely. Secondly, men have to pursue women, but there are no guidelines to doing so. All women have a different tolerance for flirting and contact. If a guy never makes an advance, he never gets a woman. If he comes in weak and respectful, some women will hate that. If he comes on strong, some women will see it as harrassment. As a guy, I\u2019m perplexed as to what to do as some women would feel uncomfortable if you simply ask them on a date. Instead of simply calling out these guys, can people actually come up with clear direction on how guys should act. Finally, Weinstein and others were clearly wrong. I am not defending that, but this seems like they simply found you attractive and wanted a chance. Its in a grey area.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSweetJamesJones,\n\nYou know how I just eviscerated Madril a few seconds ago? Well, after careful consideration, in light of the revelations about Jesse Jackson, John Singleton, Harvey Weinstein, Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore and, now, Louis C.K., I think I need to say this:\n\nMen are trash.\n\nI know women say that shit all the time as if it were a joke, but they have no idea the percentage of men who are shit bags who should be tossed on the trash heap of humanity. We ain\u2019t shit. None of us. Myself included.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYep, I ain\u2019t shit, either, SweetJamesJones. If I wasn\u2019t a piece of human garbage, my knuckles would be bleeding from punching motherfuckers like you in their fuckboy mouths. When I read about people like Bill Cosby, R. Kelly or Harvey Weinstein, I\u2019m not even shocked, because every man knows multiple other nonfamous men who do the same thing (minus the asking women if they can masturbate in front of them. That\u2019s strictly a white-boy thing). But we don\u2019t say shit because we aren\u2019t shit.\n\nSo you\u2019re saying men don\u2019t know where to draw the line for sexual harassment because some women like it? What kind of idiotic statement is that? There is a small minority of people who like everything, SweetShitJones. I know a woman who likes ketchup on her eggs, but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t an atrocity. I once saw heard about a documentary on this streaming site called Pornhub about a man who became sexually excited from women defecating on him. He liked it. So would it be OK if a woman shit in your mouth without asking you, SweetJamesJones?\n\nJames, you say there are no guidelines to pursuing women. But there are. I\u2019ll tell you where the line is:\n\nStop. Being. White. People.\n\nSexism is just like racism, James. Only white people and toxic motherfuckers like you think in those selfish terms of not giving a damn about how anyone feels as long as you can ejaculate at the end of the encounter. You can\u2019t rape and enslave whole human beings because you want to have an orgasm or own a plantation, James. That\u2019s evil, man. There is just no other way to say it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know what the fucked-up thing is, James?\n\nI believe you don\u2019t know where the line is. I believe you were being sincere. I believe Madril was being sincere. Madril doesn\u2019t feel like he hates black people, and you don\u2019t believe you hate women. At least Madril is just taking literal candy.\n\nBut just as Madril believes racism is a byproduct of normal society, you believe sexual harassment is a byproduct of your inherent male right to stick your dick into a moist hole\u2014all other humans be damned. The line is you, James. You are already across it because you think there is actually a line where you can almost sexually harass someone, but not quite!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoddamn, man, what the fuck is wrong with you?\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with us?\n\nWe ain\u2019t shit.\n\nDamn, damn, damn, James.\n\nI\u2019m out.", "keywords": ["clapback", "roots", "think", "dont", "mailbag", "area", "know", "gray", "women", "black", "white", "im", "say", "shit", "madril"], "polarity": -0.02480267748124891, "subjectivity": 0.490844671201814},

Way to demonize white people when your own shit race is responsible for the most crime in the country despite being only somewhere between 12-15% of the population. Go educate yourself so you can have some context the next time you feel like you want to speak about something you are so clearly ignorant in.\u2019\n\nDear Mr. YouAreStupid:\n\nFirst, I and my \u201cshit race\u201d would like to thank you for going on Twitter, creating an account and naming it \u201cMichael YouAreStupid.\u201d I wish I had that much time on my hands, but bravo to you. You are obviously good at whatever you do ... and racism. You are very good at racism.\n\nSecond, I\u2019m glad you brought to my attention how much less advanced my \u201cshit race\u201d is than every other race. Your intense research of stupid internet memes instantly trumps the nondebatable historical facts that every advancement in ancient European society was stolen from Africa.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you have an \u201calt-right\u201d meme about how the things you hold dear for having been created by \u201cWestern civilization\u201d and white men were remnants of knowledge we donated to the savage palefaces who traveled to Egypt to learn science, astronomy and architecture? Is there a Twitter pic that shows how Socrates, Plato and Aristotle were really just hacks regurgitating remnants of philosophy they learned in Africa?\n\nDoes your meme research include any captions that talk about how the now decrepit Greek and Roman buildings were constructed centuries after the pyramids? Is there one that explains how Europeans thought the Earth was flat and the sun revolved around the Earth and didn\u2019t know how to navigate with compasses or by the stars until someone from the \u201cdark continent\u201d told them: \u201cHold up, you silly white man. Let me show you something\u201d?\n\nOr maybe you might be able to find a photo that represents the idea that Africans are living in huts because thirsty, greedy white men arrived on the shores of Africa ready to rape, pillage and plunder everything on the continent because ... well ... that\u2019s just what white people do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr, just to see what it would look like, maybe you could show a collage comparison of the Native Americans, Africans, Aborigines, Aztecs, Mayans, Taino and Inuit to illustrate what happens when white people show up.\n\nNah, that\u2019s just too many \u201cshit race\u201d boxes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrianboz, there are a lot of black people who immediately dismiss the idea of reverse racism. I do not. I believe that it exists because I once met a white guy who explained to me how he grew up poor in an all-black neighborhood and was constantly picked on. I stand against all racism, even the reverse kind. It is demeaning, and no one should have to endure it.\n\nI think affirmative action is definitely a form of reverse racism. I also think that reverse racism is actually worse than regular, American-made, throwback racism, because no one acknowledges it, and it is harder to deal with.\n\nB-Boz, I understand that being white is like being a piece of delicate crystal\u2014you are easily broken. Someone so fragile shouldn\u2019t have to experience the horror of bigotry. I mean, black people have the luxury of having had their skin and psyches weathered and hardened by centuries of dealing with prejudice. It hurts so much more when you must deal with it once or twice in a lifetime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome people would say that crying about reverse racism is like whining about how much it hurts when lightning strikes, but not me, Boz. I feel your pain. I understand how affirmative action probably gave the two minority Fortune 500 CEOs their jobs, but the other 498 \u201cworked their way to the top.\u201d I believe you are right to direct accusations of reverse racism toward college admissions boards who want diverse institutions. I can\u2019t imagine how bad you feel when you are excluded from a job because a company wants to hire more minorities.\n\nBut I have a question for you, Brian B: Do you feel the same pain in your panties-bunched anal region when you conveniently ignore the biased testing, unequal education system, and history of segregation and exclusion that created the need for those programs? Are your white tears as salty when you think about how the black unemployment rate has been double that of whites for more than 50 years? When you hear how r\u00e9sum\u00e9s with black names are tossed in the trash, or how black people are paid less than white people regardless of education or experience, do you have the same level of butt-hurtedness?\n\nOne more question, Brian: Would you like to hear how I know the concept of \u201creverse racism\u201d is a bullshit product of white fragility, white tears and idiotic, unaware cognitive dissonance?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause\u2014unlike the original-recipe racism that black people deal with every day\u2014\u201creverse racism\u201d happens so infrequently to white people that when it does, they actually remember it.\n\nThe following tweets are in response to the new Nas-and-Jay-Z-like beef between me and Megan McArdle in this article:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSabrina, don\u2019t listen to Doug. He is wrong. I do actually respect you. Contrary to popular belief, I don\u2019t hate white people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sure Doug thinks I do. There are many people who assume that I dislike white people as a whole, and I want to assure you that I do not. This next analogy is going to sound fucked up at first, but I pray you\u2019ll understand.\n\nI treat white people like my sister treats dogs.\n\nWhen my sisters and I were growing up, there were homes with mean dogs scattered throughout my neighborhood. One day, one of them got loose and bit my sister on the leg. She has been afraid of dogs ever since.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy sister is smart. She knows that not every dog bites. She understands that most dogs won\u2019t bite her. But there is no way to distinguish the ones who will bite from the ones who won\u2019t, so she just stays away from dogs. She doesn\u2019t trust them.\n\nHere\u2019s the funny thing: My sister has a rescue dog named Lola that she absolutely loves. Actually, she loves Lola more than people should love animals. She takes her dog to dog church and treats it like a human. She knows Lola won\u2019t bite her because she knows Lola.\n\nSabrina, when I write about \u201cwhite people,\u201d I\u2019m writing about the mean ones. I\u2019m writing about the racist ones. I\u2019m not talking about all white people when I talk about race. I know that there are some white people who don\u2019t hold malice and racism in their hearts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut imagine how you would feel if you were attacked by dogs every day for 400 years. If you have been bitten by them at civil rights marches. If you have seen them chase you off their lawns. Imagine centuries of watching them maul people who look like you. Imagine knowing that they are trained by society to attack you. Wouldn\u2019t that make you leery of dogs?\n\nBut Doug would have you believe that I hate them. I do not. I don\u2019t even think that all, or even most, will bite. I just try to deconstruct the reasons dogs are like this. I want the training to stop so that I don\u2019t get nervous every time a dog sees me. I don\u2019t hate dogs.\n\nBut I know they all have teeth.", "keywords": ["clapback", "reverse", "questions", "unanswered", "roots", "racism", "dogs", "dont", "mailbag", "know", "race", "black", "white", "im", "feel"], "polarity": 0.019458046194687433, "subjectivity": 0.41400055203490305},

In fact, \u2018are\u2019, not \u2018might be\u2019, given your willingness to conflate an image of the Confederate flag with \u2018racism\u2019. Why are you attacking white people, hon? Hypocrisy really escapes you, lol? Because YOU are projecting your own racist tendencies onto anyone who rejects your embarrassingly puerile and morally and intellectually dishonest narrative. But, hey, sweets, keep it up...you are doing a fabulous job of confirming that pompously moralizing social justice warriors are nothing but self-parodying attention seekers who repel even moderate liberals. Grow up, how embarrassing for you to publicly advertise your salivating junior high mean girl malice and ignorance.\n\nFrom: Meh1234 Oh noes! Oh noes! Not the flag! Nooooooooooooo. And OMG, you made an article about it! That means you, not just support it, but actively encourage it! Yeah, grow a pair; whichever ones you prefer. And she\u2019s right, btw. If you aren\u2019t bleeding, no bones are sticking out & you can breathe, STOP crying. It\u2019s easy to blame \u201cwhites\u201d for your issues, and it\u2019s hard to actually acknowledge that your problems are created by you. The day 13% of population stops committing 50% of crimes, is the day less shooting by cops against that 13% of population will occur. Kinda like magic, really. Nothing racist about it - we\u2019re, as humans; black, white, asian, doesn\u2019t matter really, as long we don\u2019t subscribe to marxist bullshit you do - tired of your whining. The whole world is tired of your whining. Guess what? Others were \u201coppressed\u201d as well, Ottoman\u2019s Empire in Balcans was a thing for 400+ years - longer than slavery in US - and you don\u2019t hear those people whining about their ancestors and how they are owed the world, do you?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Blkk, runningnoodles and Meh1234,\n\nLook, I agree with all of you. Yesha is an oppressive racist. She makes me write that intro every week and she just asked me, \u201cWhere is the mailbag?\u201d The only reason she keeps doing this to me must be racism. #MikeLivesMatter.\n\n[It\u2019s 2:45 p.m. on Friday. I am ready to eat my edibles and drink some wine, yet here I am editing this. You are the oppressive one. \u2014Yesha]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though Blkk is right: If Keaton\u2019s mom supported \u201cthe racist BLM,\u201d Yesha would be cool with that because ... duhhh\u2014I never thought that Yesha was against white people. She even told me herself. She said to me, \u201cI have nothing against the alabasters.\u201d Obviously I\u2019m paraphrasing here, but I\u2019m pretty close. I had no reason not to believe her, but after reading your comments, I\u2019m beginning to suspect something is up with Yesha.\n\nI agree with runningnoodle\u2019s contention that Yesha\u2019s \u201cwillingness to conflate an image of the Confederate flag with \u2018racism\u2019\u201d is a little bit prejudiced. Yesha reached that spurious conclusion simply because she often sees the Ku Klux Klan waving the rebel flag during marches and skinheads proudly wearing it on their uniform. She refuses to factor in the possibility that people may use it to represent their heritage. Sure, it\u2019s a heritage of people who were willing to die so that slavery could endure, but why base her opinion on facts?\n\nThe man who designed the Confederate flag said that they were \u201cfighting to maintain the Heaven-ordained supremacy of the white man over the inferior or colored race; a white flag would thus be emblematical of our cause,\u201d but that is just another one of those \u201cfacts\u201d that Yesha factored in when she wrote about Keaton\u2019s mom. Facts are racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike when Meh1234 included the \u201cfact\u201d that police shoot black people because 13 percent of the population commits 50 percent of crimes, Meh1234 leaves out the fact that a large percentage of those crimes are drug-related arrests, and even though whites use drugs at about the same rate, blacks are 2.6 times more likely to be arrested for them. But who\u2019s counting? Obviously not Meh1234.\n\nI just want to confirm with all of you that I have notified the proper authorities and warned them that they should keep an eye on Yesha\u2019s black identity extremism. After they laughed me off the phone, I decided to keep a dossier myself. I\u2019m updating it every day, since no one else will.\n\nDespite the fact that Yesha has never killed a black boy in cold blood and walked away scot-free; even though she has never denied anyone employment or housing because of their race; in spite of the fact that she didn\u2019t create an unequal education, political or criminal-justice system, the fact that she wrote about a white woman who is willing to take handouts on the internet while vilifying black people just because it\u2019s actually her job to do that is no excuse. Yesha and her highfalutin words are the real racists. I see it now. Thanks, guys.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as for Yesha sullying innocent little Keaton, you are absolutely correct. Just because his mother is a racist and his father is a white supremacist doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Keaton will ... wait. Scratch that last point. I was about to use facts.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m watching her.\n\n[Also, I\u2019m not racist. I have white friends. I\u2019ve provided photographic evidence below. Ash\u00e9. \u2014Yesha]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis next letter comes from a Facebook user. I don\u2019t know specifically what he\u2019s talking about, but his rant was epic.

Black kids graduate high school. Black mothers graduate college and get married before you pop out 3 kids with 3 different men before you are 25. Black people are their own worst enemy. You are a pussy!! South Carolina , what a joke and yes us northerners make fun of people taking pics of snow dusting. What a clown!! Your nostrils stretch out to the center of your eyes. Not natural!! Plantation nigger, no doubt. That is right motherfucker, we never owned slaves. Totally different generation. A bunch of excuse makers who blame others for their races dysfunctions. Facts do not care about feelings asshole. You called Trump a racist but Obama gets a pass for having Al Sharpton as a close adviser and invited BLM to the White House. The double fucking standards. Black home ownership is the highest it has ever been under Trump. Keep drinking that Kool Aid.. Black people from the south might be the dumbest people ever. Simple mineed fools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo hours later, when he received no response, he sent this:\n\nEqual rights comes with equal responsibility to respect the rights of those who do not agree with you. Guess who said that asshole. MLK!! Funny that Donald Trump did business in NYC for 40 years and he received awards from the NAACP and other groups and even Jesse Jackson praised his work on behalf of minorities, but he suddenly became a racist when he ran for president and sheep like you fall for it hook, line and sinker. It is like black people cant think with their ,and need the fake media to think for them. You are a sheep!!! So damn easily led.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear George,\n\nYou win. Your letter is unclapbackatable. You\u2019re right. Black fathers need to stop playing sperm donors. Black people need to get an education before having children. President Barack Obama invited Black Lives Matter to the White House. I don\u2019t have a mirror in front of me right now, but my nose might actually stretch to the center of my eyes.\n\nYou are correct. By your definition of racism, neither you nor Donald Trump is a racist. You win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Kevin G\n\nTo: The Root I have been reading Jalopnik and Gizmodo for years. Recently your other articles from Kinja assets have been showing titles linking to racist articles. \u201c10 types of useless white people\u201d \u201cWhite people need to be better people\u201d And many more. I know you don\u2019t care about my opinion as a white person, but if the race of these articles were switched to any other race, YOUR teams would be shouting racism. I\u2019m sure you do this to get clicks and views, but I will no longer read anything published by your media company and it\u2019s support of racism. You should be ashamed of yourselves.\n\nNo, Kevin!\n\nDon\u2019t go. I\u2019m begging you. Please stay. On behalf of all of the employees at The Root, I\u2019d like to offer my sincerest apologies. I had no idea we were assaulting your delicate sensibilities with our anti-white commentary. Trust me, we are ashamed of ourselves. In our Wednesday staff meeting, we often worry about the content of our site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe live with constant concern about the flimsiness of the one-ply, Dollar Tree toilet-paper thickness of white skin. But now we understand the one thing we overlooked and the reason we have received so many complaints:\n\nWhite people can\u2019t read.\n\nCaucasian illiteracy is a growing problem in America that The Root has vowed to eliminate. After seeing the grammar and spelling in our hate mail, we realize these aren\u2019t isolated incidents; it\u2019s a national crisis equal only to the opioid epidemic, Chicago gun violence and when retail employees don\u2019t listen to a white woman who was obviously \u201ctold by AppleCare ... \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow we understand that Caucasians can\u2019t quite read the posts we write about homophobia in the black community, crime and misogyny. Now we fully see that when we criticize women like Tomi Lahren, Taylor Swift and former Officer Betty Shelby, we\u2019re being racist. But when we condemn people like Omarosa, Chrisette Michele or Arizona Police Officer Philip \u201cMitch\u201d Brailsford, who shot Daniel Shaver in cold blood, apparently white people can\u2019t read those articles.\n\nWhen we called out Ray Rice for his anti-anthem stance, Lil Wayne for his anti-Black Lives Matter comments, Migos for homophobia, Steve Harvey for joking about the Flint, Mich., water crisis, Sheriff David Clarke for the murders in his prison or Ben Carson for his support of Donald Trump, our fairer-skinned brethren didn\u2019t quite have the requisite level of reading comprehension to enjoy those pieces. When I wrote about the culture of black male silence surrounding sexual assault, I should have done it phonetically. And apparently, Damon Young\u2019s viral piece \u201cStraight Black Men Are the White People of Black People\u201d was too filled with words for our white audience.\n\nWe\u2019re going to change this, Kevin. Not just for you but for all of our white audience that accuses us of racism. I know you must be correct in your assessment of The Root because if not, it could only mean that you are being willfully ignorant and would rather call us racists than admit that there is a possibility that you pay attention only to things that confirm your own biases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know you\u2019d never do that, Kevin.\n\nI just want you to stay. We\u2019ll do better, Kevin. I promise. Don\u2019t leave us. We are going to miss your one or two page views per week. We might have to close up shop. Don\u2019t think I\u2019m being sarcastic or facetious. I care about you.

It wasn\u2019t that she called black people \u201csuperpredators.\u201d It wasn\u2019t because she has such a long history of underhanded shenanigans that President Barack Obama\u2019s voters felt no enthusiasm for her. It wasn\u2019t that she popped up at black churches and barbershops pandering to black people with the see-through bullshittery of how one of her best friends from college \u201cis African American.\u201d\n\nIt was me the whole time.\n\nHad I been \u201cwith her,\u201d she would\u2019ve won because I would\u2019ve told her ass to stop cheating so much. I would have told her not to try to rig the primaries. I would have told the Democratic Party to stop assuming they had the black vote by default. I would have told her to put something about black lives and police brutality in her platform before Black Lives Matter literally forced her to do it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI would have told her to stop lying and fainting. I would have given her something better to wear than pastel-colored karate suits. I would have told her to stop warmongering and nation building. And lying. And fainting. I would have asked her why the fuck was she so moderate? I would have asked her why she was chasing white voters like they owed her $20. I would have made her secure the bag.\n\nMost importantly, had I been with her, I never would have made her, Doug Jones, the Democratic Party or any other white person on the face of the earth into a savior.\n\nThe reason they treat black people like shit is that too many of us believe that just because Hillary, Doug or any other Democrat is slightly better than a Republican, we should be afraid to publicly criticize them. The Democratic Party is the proverbial plantation from which black people are afraid to run because our massa is slightly more benevolent than the other slave owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am sorry Donald Trump is president, but I am not sorry that Hillary Clinton is not my president.\n\nFuck her.\n\nI do not want a slightly better slave master.\n\nI want to be free.\n\nHere\u2019s an email from a Bernie Sanders supporter:\n\n\n\nFrom: Karla P.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Bernie would of won. I loved your piece on the Cornel West feud. I just have one thing to say about your criticism of Bernie Sanders. I know the black community was pulling for Hillary because we blindly vote for whichever Democrat they give us, but her record shows that she was never going to do anything for us. She didn\u2019t do anything for us as a Senator. She didn\u2019t take a stand for us during her husband\u2019s presidency or during her campaign. What you don\u2019t realize about Bernie is that he has been fighting for us since the civil rights movement. Our allegiance to the Democratic party is what kills us politically because they take our votes for granted. The only way our votes will ever matter is if we make politicians earn it. If not for people like you Constantly kissing Hillary\u2019s ass and downing candidates like Bernie, he would of won. Stop leading your people like sheep to the slaughter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHey, Karla!\n\nThank you so much for your kind words in the first paragraph. As for the second part of your email\u2014I\u2019m sorry you feel that way.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, Karla: I am a fan of Bernie Sanders. I want to meet him one day and shake his old, wrinkled hand because I bet it feels like grabbing a pack of hot dogs wrapped in a silk handkerchief. I know it would probably give me the heaves, but I just want to see how it feels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for Bernie as a candidate? He lost, boo. You and the rest of his supporters can stop crying those socialist Democrat white tears any day now. Let that shit go! I know you think Hillary rigged the race, and so do I. But you know what? That\u2019s your fault. What the fuck is wrong with you that you sided with the one white motherfucker on the planet with too much integrity to cheat?\n\nI\u2019m why Bernie lost?\n\nOld man Sanders lost because he brought a rusty-ass, antique knife to a gunfight. I wish politics were more honest, but as long as they aren\u2019t, I want someone who\u2019s willing to slit throats, not some decrepit, counterfeit do-gooder in a J.C. Penney\u2019s suit! Do you know what would have happened if Bernie were in office? The Republican majority in the House and Senate would have eaten him alive and spit him out. Because\u2014and I\u2019m just guessing here\u2014he tastes like a sixth-grade social studies test boiled in hot dog water.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think the only hope for American politics is a true third-party candidate, so I feel no allegiance to the Democratic or Republican Party. I vote for the candidate I want to win, and 99.9 percent of the time, that candidate is a Democrat.\n\nI liked many of Bernie\u2019s ideas and political theories. But I like them in the same way I like the idea of eating a box of hot Krispy Kreme doughnuts while sitting courtside at the Staples Center during Game 7 of the NBA Finals as Lonzo Ball passes the ball to the newly signed LeBron James, who hits the game-winning shot for the Lakers. And as I\u2019m being hugged by Beyonc\u00e9, I barely have time to high-five Colin Kaepernick and congratulate him on his new job as the starting quarterback of the Carolina Diddies before Rihanna taps me on the shoulder and asks me if I want to go to the bathroom and hit the blunt with her, but I can\u2019t ... because you know how my wife gets mad because Rihanna is always sweatin\u2019 me, and I don\u2019t want to argue in the helicopter on the way home.\n\nA Bernie Sanders presidency is as unlikely as that scenario.\n\nKrispy Kreme donuts are trash. Also, I hate the way you\u2019ve just spelled \u201cdoughnuts.\u201d \u2014Yesha\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext are a series of direct messages from a Trump supporter on Twitter named Robert O. You probably wouldn\u2019t be able to understand them, but because I\u2019ve corresponded with so many low-IQ white people since I\u2019ve begun my stint at The Root, I have become fluent in the \u201calt-right\u201d dialect of English. Each one of these is actually a separate message.\n\n\n\nUr a duck\n\nI think he means \u201ccuck,\u201d which is short for \u201ccuckold,\u201d a man who likes to watch other men have sex with their wives. It\u2019s a popular term for people on the alt-right to use against other white men who aren\u2019t as racist as them. Some white people believe that if they aren\u2019t racist enough, they won\u2019t be able to stop the impending black-penis attack that \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d are planning.\n\nCuck\n\nSee, I told you.\n\nAnd a beta male\n\nA beta male is a weak man, not like a strong alpha male. Or maybe he thinks I pledged a white fraternity. Are betas a thing? Can they step?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis one I\u2019m not too sure about.\n\nUr politics are garbage\n\nWe use \u201ctrash\u201d now, Robert.\n\nBy the way, I just looked at your name, and it is one of the few names that are equidistant from both the center of blackness and whiteness. \u201cRobert\u201d isn\u2019t a black name or a white name. It\u2019s just a name. It\u2019s a manly name, though. Roberts probably work hard all day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI often try to imagine what people do just from their names and the letters they write, and I bet you wear gloves to work, Robert. You\u2019re probably employed on a highway crew or cutting meat behind the glass at a grocery store. Yeah, butcher is definitely a \u201cRobert\u201d job. You don\u2019t find many Roberts in the baking or choreographer industries. But I digress ...\n\nUr view all trump supporters are nazis is garbage\n\nThanks for helping my argument, Rob.\n\nAnd ur articles are trash\n\nThat\u2019s fair. See, I told you \u201ctrash\u201d sounds much better!\n\nYou\u2019re welcome!\n\nBlack women are ashy white women are bitchy Asian women eat cats and Hispanic women have fat asses we all have stereotypes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait, Rob, that\u2019s your list of stereotypes? I feel like you could use some help in the stereotyping department. I don\u2019t want to sound racist, but you\u2019re missing out on some good ones.\n\nAll you have for black women is that they\u2019re ashy? Also, are you sure you want to give the \u201cfat asses\u201d to Hispanic women? I would never impugn your racist credentials, but I feel like, statistically speaking ...\n\nYou know what? Imma let you have this one.\n\nSo stop being a faggot\n\nBut I thought I was a cuck? You\u2019re confusing me, Rob. Am I an amphibious bird, the husband of an adulteress or a bundle of sticks? Make up your mind! And why are you on Twitter so much? Those yellow lines aren\u2019t going to paint themselves!\n\nAnd ban me from twitter u west coast lookin. Bitch\n\nWait ... I can do that?\n\nAnd, finally, from a supporter of ... umm, white people?\n\n\n\nFrom: Mitch There\u2019s no need to take sole credit for the Black Community, Michael. Yes they contributed mightily, but so did the media, thousands of volunteers, women, college-age voters (check the campus-town votes), Republicans who refused to vote, Richard Shelby (the write-in votes alone would have made up the difference) and a shit candidate. Happy to see it all working. Let\u2019s keep it all energized for high voter turnout in 2018 and 2020. Identity politics spells losses. It\u2019s wins that count, not credit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of clapping back at Mitch, I\u2019d like to critique and highlight some of my favorite parts of this Twitter direct message.\n\nThe part about how \u201cthere\u2019s no need to take sole credit for the Black Community\u201d is good, because it insinuates that there was another community that voted for Doug Jones. White women voted for Roy Moore. White men voted for Roy Moore. Black men and women voted for Doug Jones. But history shows us that when a white person tells you \u201cthere\u2019s no need\u201d for something, they are about to steal that shit.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s another good part: \u201cYes they contributed mightily but ... \u201d Always remember that everything after the word \u201cbut\u201d is always a lie.\n\nThen there\u2019s the part where he credits \u201cthe media ... volunteers, women, college-age voters ... \u201d Again, he\u2019s white-peopleing. If he extrapolated the statistical data using this thing called \u201cmath\u201d and applied it to college-age voters, he\u2019d see that white college students voted for Roy Moore. The same is true for the campus towns, women, people named \u201cNancy,\u201d people who like hot sauce instead of honey mustard and even praise dancers. This white boy just cannot give black people their due!\n\nWait ... did this motherfucker just say, \u201cRepublicans who refused to vote\u201d? REPUBLICANS WHO REFUSED TO VOTE? He\u2019s so desperate in his white-mannery that he thinks Republicans who didn\u2019t vote are the same as the black people who caused the biggest political upset since Philip \u201cUncle Phil\u201d Banks was elected to a district court judgeship on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. According to Mitch, here\u2019s who should share the glory (in no particular order): black people who voted, white people who overwhelmingly voted for the guy who lost, people doing their motherfucking jobs and white people who did abso-fucking-lutely nothing. That might be the whitest thing ever said, but you gotta admit: It\u2019s a damn good part.\n\nYou might not have noticed the part where he said: \u201cLet\u2019s keep it all working.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s\u201d as in \u201clet us.\u201d You think Mitch has some black people in his pocket? Who the fuck is the \u201cus\u201d? You think I don\u2019t know the old Caucasian \u201cwe won\u201d trick, Mitch? I liked that part, though. If only for its sliminess.\n\nBut my favorite part? The part where this glib stool sample of alabaster arrogance said: \u201cIdentity politics spells losses. It\u2019s wins that count, not credit.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoy Moore appealing to white voters wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d Talking about protecting Confederate monuments wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d Acting as if the Lord and Savior Jesus Harrison Christ commanded those who believeth in him to vote for Moore wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d Doug Jones mailing a racist-adjacent flyer with a black man bug-a-booing on the front like a new-millennium Sambo wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019 repeated invocation of the names of the four little girls killed in the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church every time he got in front of black people, as if those victims gave him a political endorsement, wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d\n\nBut me pointing out the statistical fact that black people were the only group who supported Jones, while white people from Alabama acted like white people from Alabama always do, but they now want credit for some shit they didn\u2019t do ... I\u2019m the one playing \u201cidentity politics.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s one of my favorite parts.", "keywords": ["clapback", "roots", "told", "vote", "politics", "wasnt", "mailbag", "black", "identity", "women", "voted", "title", "insert", "white", "bernie", "clever"], "polarity": 0.0626698244677697, "subjectivity": 0.450799465628233},

Yes, we\u2019re making it a day of the week. The name \u201cFriday\u201d wasn\u2019t imaginative enough. Plus, it has nothing to do with frying. If they only served fried chicken and french fries, then I\u2019d be cool with the name, but I think the last day before the weekend should be reserved for clapping back.\n\nI\u2019m not just talking about how we here at The Root respond to the hateful tweets, emails or comments; I\u2019m talking about you, too. Why not use this day to clap back at everyone who fucked with you during the week? Send an anonymous note to Sheila in human resources telling her she needs to use better deodorant, if only for the one day you have team meetings. Scream \u201cFuck you\u201d to the mailman who left your packages from Amazon.com in the rain.\n\nLet this be a healing day because the end of the week should be a catharsis so that you can empty out your negative energy and absorb something positive. Because next week is going to be shitty, too. Because haters gonna hate and motherfuckers gonna motherfuck.\n\nBecause clapping back is self-care.\n\nThe following is a Twitter direct message received by staff writer Monique Judge from a reader named Patrick:\n\nSince you \u201csaid what you said\u201d I\u2019ll say what I say too: It\u2019s great and makes sense that Lion King has a predominately black cast. However you making it about race and calling people \u201cpasty faces\u201d how does that make things better? How is it not divisive? Racism is not a one way street-and your angry and hatefully-toned blog posts and replies to comments just go to show that. Racism is not an American problem, it\u2019s a human problem and honestly, minorities in America have it pretty damn good. I\u2019m not saying things are perfect, but please go to any country in the world and by comparison you will see how much more tolerant and accepting people are in the US-byfar. Just like you have nothing to be ashamed of for being black, I don\u2019t have any self-loathing tendencies for being white. It\u2019s just a shame that black people can be openly racist and think it\u2019s only an one-way street, because it\u2019s obvously not. And before you reply some angry and race-based argument about how bad being black is in America and how oppressed you are, please save it. If yo want to talk like an adult and not shout insults at people for being different than you, I\u2019m open to that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Patrick,\n\nFirst of all, Monique is racist.\n\nLet\u2019s get that out of the way. I have spoken to our HR department about her calling white people pasty faces. That\u2019s just wrong. If Monique is using Elmer\u2019s glue as a standard, I think her adjectives are offensive, too. I believe your faces have more of a biscuit-dough complexion. The good biscuits, though. Like Pillsbury or something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, I\u2019d like to thank you and all white people who have the hubris to use the \u201cIt could be worse\u201d argument. It\u2019s like telling a woman who\u2019s been beaten up and left for dead, \u201cWell, at least he didn\u2019t rape you.\u201d\n\nBut I really wanted to get to your main point, Patty. One of the things I\u2019m most confused by is the vast quantity of white people who come to a site about race, read the content and reply, \u201cWhy do you have to make everything about race?\u201d\n\nThat is literally what Monique is paid to do, Pat. Your complaint is akin to someone asking why ESPN doesn\u2019t focus on politics more often. Why does everything have to be about sports over there?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not a technical wizard by any stretch of the imagination, but let me let you in on a bit of advanced computer coding that is hidden in whatever platform you are using to read this: If you look at the top of your screen, there is a small symbol of an arrow pointing left. That is called the \u201cback button.\u201d If you click on it, miraculously you won\u2019t be forced to read Monique\u2019s words. Also, If Monique\u2019s words make you uncomfortable, then good. It\u2019s the job of everyone here to make white people uncomfortable. All white people. Uncomfortable enough to do something. Anything.\n\nSome will not feel uncomfortable at all. They will think to themselves, \u201cI\u2019m not racist, I don\u2019t participate in racism, so I\u2019m not offended by any of this because they\u2019re not talking about me.\u201d\n\nSome of them, in their discomfort, will say, \u201cFuck The Root.\u201d\n\nSome of them will say, \u201cFuck this system; I need to do something about it.\u201d\n\nAnd some, unfortunately, will feel so uncomfortable about their own subconscious racism that in hopes of absolution, they will take the time to direct-message a writer about how black people complain too much about racism as they, themselves, are whining about a motherfucking Disney movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis week, news fellow Anne Branigin wrote this story:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the article appeared, Anne received a boatload of communications. The following letter is representative of them all.\n\nFrom: ABQ\n\nTo: Anne Branigin Why dont you go in as hard on punk hillary the aristocratic bitch that used bubba to imprison millions of poor mostly black men. Or her advocacy of private prisons. And to later imply who blacks should vote for. How about shutting the fuck up bitch. What could your snow white ass come in and tell us collectively whats for our good. Im a bernie or bust voter that voted for trump cause i hated hillary and wanted an end to globalization. 8 years obama had an opportunity to adress criminal justice reform. 8 YEARS!!!!! bottom line before you go out and denounce the only person with guts to advocate for the belitttled and downtrodden do a little inbiased research your self. As a real black person, not some bitch with a platform to talk, i think that hes a ok with me. How about asking a black person before writimg about what we need pr who we feel is that person to advocate for it. It sure wasnt cunt ass hillary\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear ABQ,\n\nFirst of all ... I asked Monique, and she told me that Anne isn\u2019t pasty white or \u201csnow white.\u201d Anne confirmed that while she has seen seven dwarfs, she has never lived with seven of them. Or a prince.\n\nBut I thank you for your letter. I want to explain how this anti-Bernie bias works.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery morning, the writers at The Root compile a list of stories we will write about. Some of them are assigned to us. Some of them are newsworthy events. Some of them are our own ideas. Then we spend the rest of the day reporting, writing about or covering an issue.\n\nNone of us here at The Root are sitting around waiting for a story about Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton to surface so that we can bash either candidate. While we care about politics and how they affect minorities, when it comes to Bernie vs. Hillary, or Chrisette Michelle or most other divisive issues, we try to adhere to a strict journalistic policy known as \u201cnot giving a fuck.\u201d\n\nAnne isn\u2019t sitting around the office rocking back and forth like she\u2019s in a double Dutch competition waiting for a story so she can bash Bernie. She wrote about a quote that Bernie actually said. If you have an issue with what he said or how it was received, you should write an angry email to Bernie Sanders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou should also be aware of one other thing about Bernie Sanders (whom\u2014in the spirit of full disclosure\u2014I confess I voted for in the primaries):\n\nHe motherfucking lost.\n\nI wanted him to win. A lot of black and brown people wanted him to win. But he got his ass whipped. Very few people think that Hillary Clinton is a friend to black people or even unworthy of being called a \u201ccunt ass.\u201d (Although I do question your blackness for using that word. It\u2019s just not a thing for us.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen we write a story that reflects how actual people feel, it\u2019s not meant to be an attack. It just is. Some black and brown people just weren\u2019t down with Bernie like that. Deal with it.\n\nOr not.\n\nWe don\u2019t give a fuck.\n\nFrom: Greg T.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: You\u2019re obsession with white people Why are you so racist against white people. I think you are a good writer, but you take every opportunity to down white people. Your anti-white jokes aren\u2019t even funny anymore. Some white people don\u2019t care about race. It is people like you who are so obsessed with everything white people do or say who keep racism alive. Just like some white people need to get to know black people, you need to get to know some non-racist whites. Most white people are good people who want the same thing in life like everybody black. Sure there are some racists, but they are a small minority of white people. You need to stop focusing on them and find some non-racist white friends. Or maybe you can\u2019t because your the one whose the racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGreg,\n\nFirst of all ... what anti-white jokes? I was being serious. Every single time.\n\nI\u2019m glad you sent this. I have often been accused of being a racist. So often, in fact, that I decided to be proactive about it. The following is a letter that I hand out to anyone who accuses me of racism:\n\nDear Sir or Madam;\n\nThis letter certifies that the holder, Michael Harriot, can\u2019t be racist. We have verified that he, indeed, has at least one white friend, which exempts him from all claims of reverse racism, regular racism, anti-whiteness or hatred of Caucasians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe undersigned signatories hereby vouch for Mr. Harriot that they are his white friends, and he has never complained about their dance skills, demeaned their potato salad or asked them why they kiss their dogs in the mouth.\n\nSigned,\n\nB.

First, I would like to apologize to the readers who trusted me to bring them the latest and best clapbacks of the week. Next, I want to issue my deepest regrets to all the idiots, racists and people with generally bad grammar who feel ignored. I have failed you.\n\nThis week, through the magic of the great technical team at Fusion Media Group, I discovered that I have overlooked some of you for far too long. I discovered that I have whole-ass accounts to which fans have been sending tons of messages hate mail. First I received a notification to check my company email, to which I replied: \u201cI have company email?\u201d\n\nWhile explaining how to access this alleged email account (\u201calleged\u201d means that you don\u2019t have to believe in something\u2014even if it actually exists, correct? I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s right), the \u201cengineer\u201d (I prefer to call them \u201cscience magicians\u201d*) joked that I missed out on these emails like people miss out on their filtered-Facebook-message inbox.\n\nAgain, I said, \u201cWhatchootalmboutwillis?\u201d\n\nThe 20-something didn\u2019t get the joke, proving that inane trivia about \u201980s sitcoms is far more important than useless bullshit like algebra and information technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n*Seriously, I think all engineers know magic. The only other explanation is that they know math, science and how computers actually work, and there\u2019s no way I believe that bullshit. It\u2019s literally impossible. Next you\u2019ll be trying to convince me to believe in bullshit like unicorns, Bigfoot, climate change and evolution.\n\nYeah, right.\n\nAnyway, here are the clapbacks we have missed because I never learned the correct spells and incantations necessary to conjure up computer stuff (that\u2019s the technical term, I think).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Ray O.\n\nTo: Anne Branigin\n\nSubject: Too Many Commies In This Country You sound like a stupid, commie bi#@#h that simply repeats what she heard from her indoctrinated professors . To think colleges and universities used to be institutions of higher education. The insults you throw at the president of the United States and other politicians simply demonstrates that you graduated from kindergarten (maybe) and have no respect for this country. Please return to Iran or Yemen or whatever \u201craghead\u201d country you probably still call home. Do not pass \u201cgo\u201d, do not collect your passport, you won\u2019t need it any longer. The true Americans don\u2019t want you here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThanks for your reply, Ray. It\u2019s obvious that you and I are kindred spirits. While I love Anne, I, too, think she far too often writes about issues and news with a bias toward that nonsense people learn in college. I have spoken with her privately about using things like facts, scientific studies and research. She will never get anywhere in life doing that.\n\nDuring our impromptu counseling sessions, I\u2019ve told her that if she wants to be a \u201ctrue American\u201d like you, she must learn to get the truth from the one place where all real Americans find it: their guts.\n\nBut I could tell she was confused. See, Anne can\u2019t shake free from the indoctrination she received by getting an actual master\u2019s degree in journalism and instead adhere to the journalistic integrity of random yahoos who email her to tell her to go back to countries she\u2019s not from. You see, Anne has not come to the realization that there is a difference between \u201cthe truth\u201d and \u201cmy truth.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe has yet to comprehend the fact that we live in a post-truth society where one can deny climate change because it feels colder, or white people can grab tiki torches and commit acts of terror because they feel oppressed. I continue to work with Anne on this, but there\u2019s one other question that I\u2019d like to ask you:\n\nWhy did you feel the need to censor the word \u201cbitch\u201d? Did you think a woman would be OK with your calling her a \u201cstupid commie\u201d or a \u201craghead\u201d but then clutch her pearls when she read the word \u201cbitch\u201d? Are racism and xenophobia OK in your circle, but sexism is going too far? You\u2019re such a fucking gentleman, Ray.\n\nBut let\u2019s get back to Anne and what it means to be a \u201ctrue American,\u201d because I don\u2019t know what that means. When your parents, grandparents or great-grandparents came to this country, did they not become \u201ctrue Americans\u201d? How long does it take? Must Anne do something like steal land, kidnap blacks, rape, commit genocide or write asterisk-laced racist diatribes to people she disagrees with before she gets an invitation into your club of lying, murdering, raping, reneging thieves?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m asking for a Native American friend.\n\nOh and one more thing:\n\nYour mama\u2019s a b***h.\n\nDon\u2019t be offended; I didn\u2019t type it out. Plus, look at her son.\n\nHey man, that\u2019s just \u201cmy truth.\u201d\n\nThe next message was found in the hidden double-secret, filtered-message inbox:\n\nFrom: Shane G.

Plus, I would never insert my penis into the dry, wrinkled hole that gave life to anything like you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Jo\n\nSubject: No longer following NFL\n\nTo: Stephen Crocket Obviously that is a lie. Starting with a lie is a bad foundation. I am positive you never served your country in any way shape or form as Mr. Kaep has also not served. Also I am sure you will not allow me to tell you how to spend your money. Just as you can not tell any NFL owner how to spend theirs. NFL owners do not have to put out a good product because it is not necessary for them to do so to make millions. They have blind follows. It is always about money. I do not watch The NFL nor do I support what they stand for because starting from the owners, coaches and players they are all over paid for whatever skill,or talent people feel they have there by creating all this ego and false value. Just like writers like yourself and those you work with who continually spew out their praises. I understand Mr Kaep\u2019s cause and realize it is a worthy one but he should have picked a different a venue to express himself. Get a life and write about something else. Oh yes try to tell the truth a forgotten area in your chosen profession\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Jo,\n\nThank you for your service. (I don\u2019t know if you have ever served in the military\u2014I\u2019m talking about your service to whiteness.)\n\nHere\u2019s a surprise: I actually agree with you. You have every right to disagree with the Colin Kaepernick protest. It is supposed to upset you. That is the point of a protest. However ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat does not mean anyone has to give a fuck.\n\nDo you think Rosa Parks gave a fuck about the people who were going to be late on that Montgomery, Ala., bus? I bet Harriet Tubman never considered the slave owners\u2019 financial losses; nor did civil rights workers worry about the people who wanted to sit down and eat their grilled-cheese sandwiches at segregated lunch counters. When state troopers cracked John Lewis\u2019 skull open on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., I\u2019m sure, as he faded into darkness, that there is one thought that never crossed his mind:\n\n\u201cDamn, this is really going to screw up traffic.\u201d\n\nSo I\u2019m sorry that you wish Kaepernick had picked a different venue to protest. The next time a black mother is crying over the body of her son as the blood spills onto the concrete from the bullet piercings, I will be sure to send her a note asking:\n\n\u201cCan you pick a different venue to mourn?\u201d\n\nOne year ago this week, I was asked to mediate a microscopic difference of opinion (it wasn\u2019t really a beef) about the film The Birth of a Nation after a prominent news anchor (Roland Martin) disagreed with a writer at The Root (Yesha Callahan) who said that the film was a flop, saying that she was dancing on the film\u2019s grave. His comments resembled the sentiments of many black men that black feminists had doomed the movie, so I wrote this article:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter that piece was published, I received a lot of backlash, including this voice message, which is exactly 1 year old today.

But President Trump, whose proven himself to be the pettiest of bitches, commanded his personal top cop Jeff \u201cKing Keebler\u201d Sessions to fire McCabe.\n\n\n\nSessions waited until just before 10 p.m. to announce that McCabe, who would\u2019ve been eligible for his full pension in just one day, was going to be terminated, because the Trump administration is nothing if not dramatic.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, McCabe stepped down from his second in command post at the FBI earlier this year, but was still employed and was still fighting to keep his job as recently as Thursday. The Post notes that McCabe spent some four hours inside the Justice Department pleading his case.\n\nBut, like Simba\u2019s uncle Scar before him, Trump has proven himself to be an evil bitch. He just couldn\u2019t let McCabe bow out with his money. Nope, he just had to knee-cap him on his way out the door.\n\nThe Post notes that McCabe\u2019s firing comes after a general investigation found that he \u201cauthorized the disclosure of sensitive information to the media about a Clinton-related case, then misled investigators about his actions in the matter, people familiar with the matter have said.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cConsidering McCabe\u2019s number of years at the agency and estimations of his high-level pay grade, formulas published by the US Office of Personnel Management for law enforcement officers show that his yearly payout could hit in the area of $60,000 each year, if McCabe were to retire after his birthday on Sunday,\u201d CNN reports.\n\n\n\nThe Post reports that McCabe can seek legal action to try and get his pension wages, but good luck with that. McCabe spent 20 years with the FBI and his tenure ends just days before he could have bowed out quietly.\n\nIn my best Joanne the Scammer voice I say, \u201cTrump is a messy bitch who lives for drama\u201d so much so that he couldn\u2019t wait to hop on Twitter at midnight to gloat over McCabe\u2019s firing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this is the president that 53% of white women voted against their own self-interst to put in office and so far he\u2019s doing a stellar job, assuming of course that his job is to guide America into the fiery pits of hell.", "keywords": ["mccabe", "office", "president", "trump", "pension", "fires", "mad", "mccabes", "post", "spent", "director", "screwing", "job", "petty", "proven", "fbi", "retire"], "polarity": 0.12170781893004115, "subjectivity": 0.42366255144032927},

But Trump has been gushing privately for weeks about using the death penalty in drug cases in which the user dies. Because Trump can\u2019t stop campaigning, he\u2019s even praised countries that execute drug lords, The Hill reports:\n\n\u201cIf you go to Singapore, I said, \u2018Mr. President, what happens with your drugs?\u2019 \u2018We don\u2019t have a problem.

It might help you understand why The Root started this weekly tradition.

Introductions are important! \u2014Yesha].\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I was 11 years old, a bully named Jamaal was about to beat up one of my friends when Jamaal tripped and fell on the sidewalk. I quickly quipped, \u201cThat nigga Jamaal be tripping,\u201d and everyone burst into laughter.\n\nJamaal got in my face and kindly informed me that he was going to kick my ass.

Jamaal is pretty big.\u201d\n\nThe next day, no one remembered me running home like a scared rat, but they remembered that joke I said about Jamaal. That\u2019s when I realized: A smart, witty retort is even better than kicking someone\u2019s ass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, that story is 100 percent fake. The following emails are 100 percent real. Blame Yesha.\n\n[Thank you; that was a good fable/introduction. \u2014Yesha]\n\nThe following is a direct message from a Twitter user named P0lymorphic:\n\n\n\nFrom: P0lymorphic\n\nTo: Michael Harriot You are aware hate crimes apply to all people. Not just people of color. https://www.theroot.com/when-the-irish-weren-t-white-1793358754 \u2026 this article is offensive, remove it or I\u2019ll call your local pd and file a complaint for hate crimes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear P0lymorphic,\n\nI rarely do this, but I am reaching out to you because I am confused. A few weeks ago we published an article about Nazi furries that engendered a furtwa against me. Every day since, I have received hate mail from people who like to dress up as magenta German shepherds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can see that your Twitter bio picture is some kind of animal in a Nazi uniform. Because of the past few weeks, that\u2019s not so weird. The crazy part is this: In your direct message accusing me of a \u201chate crime,\u201d you never mentioned furries, the alt-right furry article or anything about your polymorphism!\n\nThis leaves me with some questions for you, P0lymorphic. I hope you can provide some clear answers:\n\n\n\nWhy are you dressed up like an alt-right golden retriever? Look, I get it, we all have our preferences. I am not a human supremacist. I feel like blacks, whites, Hispanics, Asians and people who want to walk around like the love child of Sonic the Hedgehog and a Teletubbie all deserve the same rights. What puzzles me is why you want to marginalize others. Who are you specifically against? Black bears? Do you want to build a wall to keep out the chihuahuas coming here to take your furry jobs? Are you Homo (sapiens) phobic?\n\nAre you Irish? The link you provided is to an article about the false notion that the Irish were slaves. Was that a mistake, or are you willing to forgive me for making fun of your predilection for polymorphism, but the fact that I wrote about the Irish upsets you? What are you going to tell the police? When they come to your home to answer the complaint, will you be wearing your SS-officer fox outfit? Are you going to ... wait. I think I just figured it out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know what\u2019s going on. You\u2019re trying to fuck a police dog, aren\u2019t you, P0lymorphic? You\u2019re using my splendid name to lure an unsuspecting K-9 officer to your home so you can make sweet love to another animal in uniform.\n\nI refuse to be a part of your sick games, P0lymorphic. I see through your little ruse. Shame on you!\n\nThe next message is from the comment section for Monique Judge\u2019s article about why emotional maturity and emotional intelligence are important in healthy relationships:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear AluNoir:\n\nMonique\u2019s definitions of emotional intelligence and emotional maturity come directly from psychological definitions, specifically, Psychology Today. But it brings up a greater point about a subject we need to discuss: I don\u2019t think you\u2019re very emotionally intelligent or mature, AluNoir. I have never met you personally, so I am basing my conjecture on one theory:\n\nHit dogs.\n\nThere is an old Southern saying that goes, \u201cA hit dog will holler,\u201d meaning that when you say or do something to a group of people, the one who is offended will let it be known. This happens often at The Root. Allow me to present you with another recent example:\n\nThis week I wrote this article:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could easily find 10 comments that objected to the article, but I think the easiest way would be to just post this letter (that\u2019s right, you are about to see a clapback inside a clapback. That\u2019s some Inception-level shit):\n\nFrom: Kristi Z\n\nTo: Michael Harriot Michael, it\u2019s hard to understand how you could write an article about Trump calling Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas being racist and then call all white women Beckies. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s just as bad? Using your logic, if Trump using a traditional native American name as a slur means he hates Indians, does this means you hate all women? I can tell youdo but I want to hear you say it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAluNoir, Kristi is a Becky.\n\nShe makes a good point that, all things being equal, calling a woman \u201cPocahontas\u201d is the same as calling a white woman a \u201cBecky.\u201d But here is the thing\u2014and I\u2019m going to type it in all caps, which, in internet parlance, means I am yelling. Because I am about to yell:\n\nALL THINGS ARE NOT EQUAL!\n\nThat is the entire point of the term \u201cBecky.\u201d That is the entire point of the term \u201cwypipo.\u201d If the infinitely small dig of \u201cBecky\u201d and \u201cwypipo\u201d upsets you, then imagine how white supremacy must feel. Imagine how being labeled a \u201cthug\u201d feels. Or \u201cunderprivileged.\u201d Or \u201curban.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most important (here is where I tie the point up in a neat little bow), anyone who objects to the the truth of a psychological definition or a hackneyed joke of a quiz is probably a hit dog.\n\nAluNoir thinks that Monique must be living in an alternate reality because she believes in psychology. AluNoir believes that anyone who uses the actual definition of a term is delusional. AluNoir is emotionally unintelligent and emotionally immature. Alu Noir is a hit dog.\n\nJust like Kristi. Kristi literally believes that anyone who makes a joke about white women must obviously hate all women. According to Kristi, that is the only possible explanation. I mean ... who could possibly dislike white women, with their entitled attitudes and their credit-card-shaped buttocks?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy Kristi\u2019s standards, either I\u2019m a hater or there are people on this earth who actually believe that there are some white women whose entire existence is predicated on their privilege. Kristi can\u2019t fathom that it could possibly be the former, so it must be the latter. Kristi is a hit dog. Kristi is a Becky.\n\nI beg of you, AuNoir ...\n\nDon\u2019t be like Kristi.\n\nThe next letter is an email to one of our female writers. I have concealed her name in case there are others out there like this:\n\n\n\nFrom: Ron E.\n\nSubject: Your worn panties Would it be possible for you to sell me your worn panties? Please let me know.\n\nThank you kindly. XOXOX Ron\n\nDear Ron,\n\nFirst of all, I am jealous. I have been writing for The Root for quite a while and no one has solicited a pair of my boxers. Even though I am disappointed, I will let it go so that I can bring up another salient point:\n\nWhy, though?\n\nWhy do you want a pair of panties? More important, what endows you with the confidence to ask?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have often wondered how men like Louis C.K., Harvey Weinstein and Mark Halperin would think that a woman would want to see them masturbate. How could they pose questions like, \u201cYou wanna see me wash my bloated, fluorescent dad bod in the shower or watch me manhandle my penis like a bicycle pump?\u201d I have come up with a theory:\n\nIt works.\n\nI can\u2019t believe that these middle-aged men would continue to ask women these obscene questions if no one, at some point, said yes. Human nature doesn\u2019t work that way. Therefore, I have come up with a solution I call the \u201cThanksgiving rule.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you are a man, every Thanksgiving, you should gather your aunts, sisters, mother and grandmother in a room and reveal your sexual proclivities. Tell them, \u201cI\u2019m trying to find a woman who likes when a man grabs her breasts without asking.\u201d Ask them if they know a nice girl at their church who might be looking for a guy to furiously masturbate into their house plant.\n\nIf they look disgusted or throw mashed potatoes in your face, take that as a sign that you shouldn\u2019t do it to strangers. If you can\u2019t do it at home, don\u2019t do it in public.\n\nI think I just solved the entire sexual-misconduct crisis. That\u2019s what the mailbag is here for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.", "keywords": ["clapback", "tripping", "roots", "point", "hate", "article", "important", "wypipo", "think", "mailbag", "kristi", "women", "white", "jamaal", "thats"], "polarity": -0.0044653880070546735, "subjectivity": 0.49038800705467367},

She even told me herself. She said to me, \u201cI have nothing against the alabasters.\u201d Obviously I\u2019m paraphrasing here, but I\u2019m pretty close. I had no reason not to believe her, but after reading your comments, I\u2019m beginning to suspect something is up with Yesha.\n\nI agree with runningnoodle\u2019s contention that Yesha\u2019s \u201cwillingness to conflate an image of the Confederate flag with \u2018racism\u2019\u201d is a little bit prejudiced. Yesha reached that spurious conclusion simply because she often sees the Ku Klux Klan waving the rebel flag during marches and skinheads proudly wearing it on their uniform. She refuses to factor in the possibility that people may use it to represent their heritage. Sure, it\u2019s a heritage of people who were willing to die so that slavery could endure, but why base her opinion on facts?\n\nThe man who designed the Confederate flag said that they were \u201cfighting to maintain the Heaven-ordained supremacy of the white man over the inferior or colored race; a white flag would thus be emblematical of our cause,\u201d but that is just another one of those \u201cfacts\u201d that Yesha factored in when she wrote about Keaton\u2019s mom. Facts are racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike when Meh1234 included the \u201cfact\u201d that police shoot black people because 13 percent of the population commits 50 percent of crimes, Meh1234 leaves out the fact that a large percentage of those crimes are drug-related arrests, and even though whites use drugs at about the same rate, blacks are 2.6 times more likely to be arrested for them. But who\u2019s counting? Obviously not Meh1234.\n\nI just want to confirm with all of you that I have notified the proper authorities and warned them that they should keep an eye on Yesha\u2019s black identity extremism. After they laughed me off the phone, I decided to keep a dossier myself. I\u2019m updating it every day, since no one else will.\n\nDespite the fact that Yesha has never killed a black boy in cold blood and walked away scot-free; even though she has never denied anyone employment or housing because of their race; in spite of the fact that she didn\u2019t create an unequal education, political or criminal-justice system, the fact that she wrote about a white woman who is willing to take handouts on the internet while vilifying black people just because it\u2019s actually her job to do that is no excuse. Yesha and her highfalutin words are the real racists. I see it now. Thanks, guys.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as for Yesha sullying innocent little Keaton, you are absolutely correct. Just because his mother is a racist and his father is a white supremacist doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Keaton will ... wait. Scratch that last point. I was about to use facts.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m watching her.\n\n[Also, I\u2019m not racist. I have white friends. I\u2019ve provided photographic evidence below. Ash\u00e9. \u2014Yesha]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis next letter comes from a Facebook user. I don\u2019t know specifically what he\u2019s talking about, but his rant was epic. Enjoy.\n\n\n\nFrom: George S.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot Fuck black lives matter nigger boy.. Always playing the fucking victims. Here is some good advice. Black fathers, stop being sperm donors. Black kids graduate high school. Black mothers graduate college and get married before you pop out 3 kids with 3 different men before you are 25. Black people are their own worst enemy. You are a pussy!! South Carolina , what a joke and yes us northerners make fun of people taking pics of snow dusting. What a clown!! Your nostrils stretch out to the center of your eyes. Not natural!! Plantation nigger, no doubt. That is right motherfucker, we never owned slaves. Totally different generation. A bunch of excuse makers who blame others for their races dysfunctions. Facts do not care about feelings asshole. You called Trump a racist but Obama gets a pass for having Al Sharpton as a close adviser and invited BLM to the White House. The double fucking standards. Black home ownership is the highest it has ever been under Trump. Keep drinking that Kool Aid.. Black people from the south might be the dumbest people ever. Simple mineed fools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo hours later, when he received no response, he sent this:\n\nEqual rights comes with equal responsibility to respect the rights of those who do not agree with you. Guess who said that asshole. MLK!! Funny that Donald Trump did business in NYC for 40 years and he received awards from the NAACP and other groups and even Jesse Jackson praised his work on behalf of minorities, but he suddenly became a racist when he ran for president and sheep like you fall for it hook, line and sinker. It is like black people cant think with their ,and need the fake media to think for them. You are a sheep!!! So damn easily led.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear George,\n\nYou win. Your letter is unclapbackatable. You\u2019re right. Black fathers need to stop playing sperm donors. Black people need to get an education before having children. President Barack Obama invited Black Lives Matter to the White House. I don\u2019t have a mirror in front of me right now, but my nose might actually stretch to the center of my eyes.\n\nYou are correct. By your definition of racism, neither you nor Donald Trump is a racist. You win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Kevin G\n\nTo: The Root I have been reading Jalopnik and Gizmodo for years. Recently your other articles from Kinja assets have been showing titles linking to racist articles. \u201c10 types of useless white people\u201d \u201cWhite people need to be better people\u201d And many more. I know you don\u2019t care about my opinion as a white person, but if the race of these articles were switched to any other race, YOUR teams would be shouting racism. I\u2019m sure you do this to get clicks and views, but I will no longer read anything published by your media company and it\u2019s support of racism. You should be ashamed of yourselves.\n\nNo, Kevin!\n\nDon\u2019t go. I\u2019m begging you. Please stay. On behalf of all of the employees at The Root, I\u2019d like to offer my sincerest apologies. I had no idea we were assaulting your delicate sensibilities with our anti-white commentary. Trust me, we are ashamed of ourselves. In our Wednesday staff meeting, we often worry about the content of our site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe live with constant concern about the flimsiness of the one-ply, Dollar Tree toilet-paper thickness of white skin. But now we understand the one thing we overlooked and the reason we have received so many complaints:\n\nWhite people can\u2019t read.\n\nCaucasian illiteracy is a growing problem in America that The Root has vowed to eliminate. After seeing the grammar and spelling in our hate mail, we realize these aren\u2019t isolated incidents; it\u2019s a national crisis equal only to the opioid epidemic, Chicago gun violence and when retail employees don\u2019t listen to a white woman who was obviously \u201ctold by AppleCare ... \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow we understand that Caucasians can\u2019t quite read the posts we write about homophobia in the black community, crime and misogyny. Now we fully see that when we criticize women like Tomi Lahren, Taylor Swift and former Officer Betty Shelby, we\u2019re being racist. But when we condemn people like Omarosa, Chrisette Michele or Arizona Police Officer Philip \u201cMitch\u201d Brailsford, who shot Daniel Shaver in cold blood, apparently white people can\u2019t read those articles.\n\nWhen we called out Ray Rice for his anti-anthem stance, Lil Wayne for his anti-Black Lives Matter comments, Migos for homophobia, Steve Harvey for joking about the Flint, Mich., water crisis, Sheriff David Clarke for the murders in his prison or Ben Carson for his support of Donald Trump, our fairer-skinned brethren didn\u2019t quite have the requisite level of reading comprehension to enjoy those pieces. When I wrote about the culture of black male silence surrounding sexual assault, I should have done it phonetically. And apparently, Damon Young\u2019s viral piece \u201cStraight Black Men Are the White People of Black People\u201d was too filled with words for our white audience.\n\nWe\u2019re going to change this, Kevin. Not just for you but for all of our white audience that accuses us of racism. I know you must be correct in your assessment of The Root because if not, it could only mean that you are being willfully ignorant and would rather call us racists than admit that there is a possibility that you pay attention only to things that confirm your own biases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know you\u2019d never do that, Kevin.\n\nI just want you to stay. We\u2019ll do better, Kevin. I promise. Don\u2019t leave us. We are going to miss your one or two page views per week. We might have to close up shop. Don\u2019t think I\u2019m being sarcastic or facetious. I care about you. More important, I don\u2019t want you to become the one thing that apparently offends you most:\n\nA useless white person.", "keywords": ["clapback", "yesha", "real", "roots", "racism", "fact", "racist", "dont", "flag", "mailbag", "racists", "root", "black", "white", "im"], "polarity": 0.045220941238519365, "subjectivity": 0.44795817245817227},

Way to demonize white people when your own shit race is responsible for the most crime in the country despite being only somewhere between 12-15% of the population. Go educate yourself so you can have some context the next time you feel like you want to speak about something you are so clearly ignorant in.\u2019\n\nDear Mr. YouAreStupid:\n\nFirst, I and my \u201cshit race\u201d would like to thank you for going on Twitter, creating an account and naming it \u201cMichael YouAreStupid.\u201d I wish I had that much time on my hands, but bravo to you. You are obviously good at whatever you do ... and racism. You are very good at racism.\n\nSecond, I\u2019m glad you brought to my attention how much less advanced my \u201cshit race\u201d is than every other race. Your intense research of stupid internet memes instantly trumps the nondebatable historical facts that every advancement in ancient European society was stolen from Africa.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you have an \u201calt-right\u201d meme about how the things you hold dear for having been created by \u201cWestern civilization\u201d and white men were remnants of knowledge we donated to the savage palefaces who traveled to Egypt to learn science, astronomy and architecture? Is there a Twitter pic that shows how Socrates, Plato and Aristotle were really just hacks regurgitating remnants of philosophy they learned in Africa?\n\nDoes your meme research include any captions that talk about how the now decrepit Greek and Roman buildings were constructed centuries after the pyramids? Is there one that explains how Europeans thought the Earth was flat and the sun revolved around the Earth and didn\u2019t know how to navigate with compasses or by the stars until someone from the \u201cdark continent\u201d told them: \u201cHold up, you silly white man. Let me show you something\u201d?\n\nOr maybe you might be able to find a photo that represents the idea that Africans are living in huts because thirsty, greedy white men arrived on the shores of Africa ready to rape, pillage and plunder everything on the continent because ... well ... that\u2019s just what white people do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr, just to see what it would look like, maybe you could show a collage comparison of the Native Americans, Africans, Aborigines, Aztecs, Mayans, Taino and Inuit to illustrate what happens when white people show up.\n\nNah, that\u2019s just too many \u201cshit race\u201d boxes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrianboz, there are a lot of black people who immediately dismiss the idea of reverse racism. I do not. I believe that it exists because I once met a white guy who explained to me how he grew up poor in an all-black neighborhood and was constantly picked on. I stand against all racism, even the reverse kind. It is demeaning, and no one should have to endure it.\n\nI think affirmative action is definitely a form of reverse racism. I also think that reverse racism is actually worse than regular, American-made, throwback racism, because no one acknowledges it, and it is harder to deal with.\n\nB-Boz, I understand that being white is like being a piece of delicate crystal\u2014you are easily broken. Someone so fragile shouldn\u2019t have to experience the horror of bigotry. I mean, black people have the luxury of having had their skin and psyches weathered and hardened by centuries of dealing with prejudice. It hurts so much more when you must deal with it once or twice in a lifetime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome people would say that crying about reverse racism is like whining about how much it hurts when lightning strikes, but not me, Boz. I feel your pain. I understand how affirmative action probably gave the two minority Fortune 500 CEOs their jobs, but the other 498 \u201cworked their way to the top.\u201d I believe you are right to direct accusations of reverse racism toward college admissions boards who want diverse institutions. I can\u2019t imagine how bad you feel when you are excluded from a job because a company wants to hire more minorities.\n\nBut I have a question for you, Brian B: Do you feel the same pain in your panties-bunched anal region when you conveniently ignore the biased testing, unequal education system, and history of segregation and exclusion that created the need for those programs? Are your white tears as salty when you think about how the black unemployment rate has been double that of whites for more than 50 years? When you hear how r\u00e9sum\u00e9s with black names are tossed in the trash, or how black people are paid less than white people regardless of education or experience, do you have the same level of butt-hurtedness?\n\nOne more question, Brian: Would you like to hear how I know the concept of \u201creverse racism\u201d is a bullshit product of white fragility, white tears and idiotic, unaware cognitive dissonance?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause\u2014unlike the original-recipe racism that black people deal with every day\u2014\u201creverse racism\u201d happens so infrequently to white people that when it does, they actually remember it.\n\nThe following tweets are in response to the new Nas-and-Jay-Z-like beef between me and Megan McArdle in this article:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSabrina, don\u2019t listen to Doug. He is wrong. I do actually respect you. Contrary to popular belief, I don\u2019t hate white people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sure Doug thinks I do. There are many people who assume that I dislike white people as a whole, and I want to assure you that I do not. This next analogy is going to sound fucked up at first, but I pray you\u2019ll understand.\n\nI treat white people like my sister treats dogs.\n\nWhen my sisters and I were growing up, there were homes with mean dogs scattered throughout my neighborhood. One day, one of them got loose and bit my sister on the leg. She has been afraid of dogs ever since.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy sister is smart. She knows that not every dog bites. She understands that most dogs won\u2019t bite her. But there is no way to distinguish the ones who will bite from the ones who won\u2019t, so she just stays away from dogs. She doesn\u2019t trust them.\n\nHere\u2019s the funny thing: My sister has a rescue dog named Lola that she absolutely loves. Actually, she loves Lola more than people should love animals. She takes her dog to dog church and treats it like a human. She knows Lola won\u2019t bite her because she knows Lola.\n\nSabrina, when I write about \u201cwhite people,\u201d I\u2019m writing about the mean ones. I\u2019m writing about the racist ones. I\u2019m not talking about all white people when I talk about race. I know that there are some white people who don\u2019t hold malice and racism in their hearts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut imagine how you would feel if you were attacked by dogs every day for 400 years. If you have been bitten by them at civil rights marches. If you have seen them chase you off their lawns. Imagine centuries of watching them maul people who look like you. Imagine knowing that they are trained by society to attack you. Wouldn\u2019t that make you leery of dogs?\n\nBut Doug would have you believe that I hate them. I do not. I don\u2019t even think that all, or even most, will bite. I just try to deconstruct the reasons dogs are like this. I want the training to stop so that I don\u2019t get nervous every time a dog sees me. I don\u2019t hate dogs.\n\nBut I know they all have teeth.", "keywords": ["clapback", "reverse", "questions", "unanswered", "roots", "racism", "dogs", "dont", "mailbag", "know", "race", "black", "white", "im", "feel"], "polarity": 0.019458046194687433, "subjectivity": 0.41400055203490305},

It\u2019s just that answering more than one piece of email this week would be redundant and stupid, and here is why:\n\nThis week we received the greatest piece of hate mail of all time.\n\nI don\u2019t like overhyping things. When guys, say, tell women they are going to \u201cmake you scream all night,\u201d they usually take the woman home, give her 4 minutes and 30 seconds of frantic \u201cWhose pussy is this?\u201d thrusting, followed by a deep slumber.

It is not so much hate mail as it is white mail.\n\nOK, to be honest, it is pretty hateful, but it also embodies every piece of whiteness that has ever existed. It is a condensation of every microscopic molecule of Caucasianness. When I talk about \u201cwypipo,\u201d this is who I meant. We now have a mascot. The email is epic in its level of paleness and lack of melaninity. It is all the white things! When you read it, you will feel ...\n\nYou know what? Let\u2019s just read the letter.\n\nFrom: Nancy\n\nTo: Michael\n\nSubject: Your vile, sick, self deluded article Hey Michael Regarding your hateful rant about white people. If you think we are so bad you really need to go back to your African homeland where your own tribal leaders and ancestors pimped you for profit to jewish ship owners. Nothing to do with white europeans you despise so much. In Africa your honeland youll find they still never got civilized but there are cannibal warlords in Liberia. As Ben Carson said, a decent black man who excelled in a white mans world.\u201d the best thing that ever happen to the black man was slavery as it gave them the opportunity they would have never had in Africa\u201d you guys benefit from our civilization and our inventions. Cars, planes, trains, phones, electricity, tv, radio, archetecture. Roman and greek civlization is western civilization and Im sorry your ancestors are sad ass voo doo cannibals who never made a civlization.. Deal with it instead of hate and blame. Obama is a MuslIm which is very odd as Islam are the first to enslave your black ass. Go to Islam see what they still do to blacks today. So you should be thanking white men. We let you become millionairs in our society, Presidents, educated. Your complaining is vile and makes you unworthy. As far as crime. Lets face the facts. 40, 000 white women arr raped a year by black mren. White men dont rape black women. Wonder why? 300,000 black on white crimes a year. It is racial targeted hate. We cant help we are a beautiful intelligent race. But your acts of violence are transparent. We dont protest the way you people do as we have jobs. Not on welfare. In Japan during Fukishmi not one act of violence or looting. An honorable people. Katrina and other Us disaster its your breathen doing the looting not whites. It appears to me \u201cMichael\u201d sadly the name of a great warrior archangel you disgrace with your racial hate, jealosy, lies, and most import self delusions. What you are inciting with your so called \u201cpoetry\u201d is that of your voo doo ancestors demonic verbal diarrhea . Id like to look you in the eys and expel your bullshit out of you. Your a disgrace to humanity and ungrateful trash. Like your islamic Breathen foul and unholy Obama.You will fall from your throne of hate and deceit and lies soon enough by the wrath of God. May i suggest you go to church and pray rather than hating on white peopke and twisting the reality. You could never make a civlization absent us and now think your going to slander us the hijack and get unearned credit. Well try. When we fight back I assure you we will win as we always do since the history of time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHey, Nancy,\n\nFirst of all, when you talk about my vile, racist rant against white people, it would be helpful if you pointed out which one. How am I supposed to know? That would be like going to a place where white people go (like Yankee Candle or wherever y\u2019all buy those Caucasian-fit jeans) and asking, \u201cMay I speak to a racist?\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not why I selected your letter for mailbag honors. I chose this letter because I love you, Nancy. I want to meet you and marry you. I want you by my side for the rest of my life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd not for any romantic reasons, Nancy. My love for you is really selfish. From here to eternity, whenever I speak about racism, hate and the laughable fragility of wypipo and someone objects, I only wish that I would be able to say, \u201cHave you met my wife, Nancy?\u2019\n\nThe way your well-greased whiteness slid effortlessly from a \u201cGo back to Africa\u201d into a diatribe about black rapists, directly into a \u201cYou were better off as slaves,\u201d then transitioned into a lazy, welfare-nigga stereotype, may have been the most difficult combination of fucktastic bigotry I have ever witnessed on a page. I allowed David Duke to read your letter, and he was like, \u201cDamn, that bitch is racist!\u201d\n\nAnd where the fuck did the \u201cObama is a Muslim\u201d part come in? I gotta admit, Nancy, that shit came out of nowhere. It surprised me because I thought you were going in a whole different direction, but then you pivoted on me and wedged a little Islamophobia in there. And you prefaced it with a Ben Carson reference. And the subtle anti-Semitism of blaming slavery on the Jews was revelatory. It\u2019s rare to find respectability, white supremacy, Jew hate and Muslim hate right next to one another, without a new paragraph or anything. Well played, Nancy. Well played.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, Nancy, I hate to point this out, but they would fire me at The Root if I didn\u2019t. If I didn\u2019t ask the following question, Editor-in-Chief Danielle Belton would call me into her office and ask me what the hell was wrong with me. She would probably stage an intervention, so I am compelled to ask:\n\nWhere the fuck is Islam?\n\nYou said I should \u201c[g]o to Islam and see what they still do to blacks today\u201d? How? I went on Travelocity and couldn\u2019t find a direct flight to Islam. Could you tell me the nearest airport? Do they have hotels, or would I need an Airbnb? There are so many questions I have, but we don\u2019t have enough time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf I were to clap back at this letter (which I won\u2019t because I\u2019m praying that you and I become pen pals), I would dispel that whole notion about the scourge of black men raping white women by telling you to read this article:\n\nBut I would never do that, because I know you don\u2019t read, Nancy. Plus, I\u2019m not clapping back at you, remember? If I were, I\u2019d ask you how you could tell black people that you are not responsible for the sins of your ancestors and then turn around and take credit for all of Western civilization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt defies logic, but then again, I know you didn\u2019t enslave me, Nancy. I am 100 percent clear that you had nothing to do with slavery, even though you somehow made slavery Barack Obama\u2019s fault. (Again, I can\u2019t stop thinking about the Obama part. Bravo, Nancy.)\n\nYou know what else I know, Nancy? I know you didn\u2019t invent shit, either. You couldn\u2019t build a boat, a house or a civilization. You can barely build a shitty email.\n\nI\u2019ll admit that you have personally never done anything to me, but I know you have done something to someone black, Nancy, simply by existing. Simply by believing that you \u201clet\u201d us be millionaires and president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore I go, since we are in the mood to take credit, allow me to take credit for something my people have given to mediocre white women whom Darwinian evolution should have stamped out long ago. Allow me to pat myself on the back for the one thing that my people have \u201clet\u201d vile, disgusting, barely literate bitches like you be:\n\nAlive.", "keywords": ["clapback", "nancy", "roots", "hate", "dont", "mailbag", "know", "read", "didnt", "women", "whitest", "email", "black", "white", "im"], "polarity": -0.050368051260908424, "subjectivity": 0.4903705421562561},

That\u2019s the lowest monthly average for any yearlong period since at least 2000; under President Obama, the same sections together averaged more than a half-dozen cases a month. Cases begin when the Justice Department starts investigating whether a person or organization violated the law. Following the investigation, DOJ attorneys send a letter or complaint detailing the allegations against them and their findings. For example, after Freddie Gray\u2019s death in Baltimore police custody in 2015, the division initiated an investigation into the department, which resulted in a findings letter the next year. Another way to measure the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights enforcement activity is to look at legal agreements reached with people, companies, and organizations accused of discrimination. These agreements are one of the most common ways a case ends, and they typically come with fines or concessions. In Baltimore, the Justice Department imposed a court-monitored consent decree that listed goals for the police to meet before it could be lifted. Under Trump, the division has reached about six of these kinds of agreements per month, on average, the fewest since at least 2000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2017 the Justice Department announced that it would be reviewing 2017\u2019s white supremacist violence and protests in Charlottesville, Va., but provided little information about where the investigation is now. Good money is on the Department of Justice finding that there are good people on both sides and that the tiki-torch-wielding white supremacists are really misunderstood, good kids just finding their way.\n\nVice News notes that a spokesman for the DOJ refused to provide the number of active investigations being pursued by the department.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason not to say,\u201d Lhamon told Vice News. \u201cWhat are they hiding?\u201d\n\nWell, for one, Sessions has yet to explain how, after all of these years, he and several of his workers have been able to make delicious cookies in a fucking tree, so there is that. It should shock no one that this administration is less concerned with the treatment of minorities, immigration rights or employment litigation\u2014all areas handled by the DOJ.

In fact, he\u2019s a pathological liar with a history of lying and then just nonchalantly acting as if what he\u2019s doing isn\u2019t lying.\n\n\n\nDuring one stretch from Jan 21. to Feb. 27, the New York Times found that the president lied publicly some 38 times. He lied about not being a fan of the Iraq War, which he totally was. He lied about how many times he appeared on Time magazine\u2019s cover; he claimed that he\u2019d been on the cover more than anyone else, but turns out he\u2019d been on the cover 15 times and former President Richard Nixon had appeared 55 times. He even lied about about two people getting shot in Chicago the same day President Barack Obama was in town making a speech; reports confirmed that no one was shot the day Obama delivered his speech.\n\nTrump lies; it\u2019s just what he does. While his lies are easily disproved, it\u2019s rare that he will readily admit that he lied, much less admit it to another world leader. The Washington Post got its hands on a fundraising speech Trump made Wednesday in which he openly admitted to making up claims during his meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. He just randomly spouted that the United States runs a trade deficit with Canada without even knowing whether that was true.\n\nHere\u2019s how the Post breaks down the audio of Trump speaking during a private event:\n\n\u201cTrudeau came to see me. He\u2019s a good guy, Justin. He said, \u2018No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please,\u2019 \u201d Trump said, mimicking Trudeau. [...] \u201cNice guy, good-looking guy, comes in \u2014 \u2018Donald, we have no trade deficit.\u2019 He\u2019s very proud because everybody else, you know, we\u2019re getting killed. \u201c ... So, he\u2019s proud. I said, \u2018Wrong, Justin, you do.\u2019 I didn\u2019t even know. ... I had no idea. I just said, \u2018You\u2019re wrong.\u2019 You know why? Because we\u2019re so stupid. \u2026 And I thought they were smart. I said, \u2018You\u2019re wrong, Justin.\u2019 He said, \u2018Nope, we have no trade deficit.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, in that case, I feel differently,\u2019 I said, \u2018but I don\u2019t believe it.\u2019 I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out, I said, \u2018Check, because I can\u2019t believe it.\u2019 \u2018Well, sir, you\u2019re actually right. We have no deficit, but that doesn\u2019t include energy and timber. \u2026 And when you do, we lose $17 billion a year.\u2019 It\u2019s incredible.\u201d The Office of the United States Trade Representative says the United States has a trade surplus with Canada. It reports that in 2016, the United States exported $12.5 billion more in goods and services than it imported from Canada, leading to a trade surplus, not a deficit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Trump\u2019s a notorious liar who actually believes his own lies, he took to Twitter on Thursday to double down on his totally false and made-up accusation.\n\nBruce Heyman, the U.S. ambassador to Canada from 2014 to 2017, blasted Trump over his remarks, tweeting that the president was \u201ccreating a crisis where none existed,\u201d USA Today reports: \u201cLying to your friends only hurts the relationship. Canada has been there for us thru thick and thin. How can you casually damage this realtionship [sic]? Shame on you!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the tape obtained by the Post, Trump attacked the North American Free Trade Agreement, reached by the U.S., Canada and Mexico, which is currently being renegotiated. And he openly mocked other politicians for wanting to keep NAFTA. He called Mexico \u201cspoiled\u201d and added that Canada had outsmarted the United States. \u201cThe best deal is to terminate it and make a new deal,\u201d he said, according to USA Today.\n\nClearly, Trump doesn\u2019t understand how any of this works.

Instead of clapping back at the people who send emails, tweets and direct messages, we would like to thank our haters, because without them, where would we be?\n\nAs you sit back munching on your leftover dressing and sweet-potato-pie sandwich (don\u2019t judge me; I\u2019m just trying to eliminate waste by recycling), remember that whatever you do in life, if you don\u2019t have haters, you\u2019re doing it wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet us commence with the clapping:\n\nOur first correspondences this week refer to a story we recently published about Nazi furries. The community of furries (not to be confused with the furry community\u2014people with an excessive amount of back hair) was very upset about our post on the trend of alt-right anthropomorphic cosplayers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Buddy\n\nTo: The Root Tips First off spreading lies about something you have little to no information about, and using a photo completely out of context, On of the suiters is a partially deaf gay man, there is just as much Nazi propaganda in the furry community and there is in a loaf of bread. This is why only certain news outlets grow enough to recognised, they don\u2019t lie nor spread rumor to get attenchen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Furries:\n\nFirst, allow me to thank you for reaching out to me. I am delighted to share this open dialogue with you and your community. I hope The Root can become a place where people of all costumes can come together and exist in unity, no matter their fur or made-up species.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, I would like to say that, as an equal opportunity site, we would never limit people from doing what they believe. As such, I want to clarify our belief that the phenomenon of \u201cwhite-people shit\u201d is not limited to people of the Caucasian persuasion. Yes, a nonwhite gay man can, indeed, participate in white-people shit.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the term was not coined to besmirch the activities enjoyed by taupe Americans. It was meant to praise their imagination, unfettered by the fear of being marginalized or categorized. Our wish for humanity is that we all, one day, can enjoy the privilege of participating in white-people shit.\n\nI do, however, object to your belief that having sex with a black man means that you cannot be a racist. History is filled with examples to the contrary. Slaveholders routinely had sex with slaves while upholding the tenets of white supremacy. There are many incidents of white women who had consensual sex with black men and then pointed lynch mobs in the direction of their lovers. Racism and interracial sex are not mutually exclusive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI, on the other hand, uphold your right to have sex with whomever you choose. Whether it be a black man or a fuchsia fox wearing a Nazi-inspired armband, if you like it, I love it.\n\nJust remember to use protection. I don\u2019t want you to get rabies.\n\nFrom: Chantel\n\nTo: Michael Harriot I read your article on Black Thanksgiving. I love your writing, but would like you to know that not everything is about race.Stuff like Thanksgiving is universal. Your aritcles about black thanksgiving is so similar to white thanksgiving. We might not eat the same kind of food, and our relatives might be slightly diferent in the way we treat each other, but everything els is exactly alike. I am white, but I recognized almost everything in your article. If The only difference in me and you is what we call our aunts and how we like our macarone, then we might not be so different afger all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Chantel,\n\nYou might want to look up the definition of the words \u201cexactly alike.\u201d\n\nThanks.\n\nFrom: Bill S.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot Hello Michael, I\u2019d like to apologize for contracting you on your personal email address.\n\nTried to find a method of contact on the site, but an email address for writing submissions was all I could find in the way of contact. I also posted this in reply to your last Clapback posting, but I\u2019m a member of the Greys and with a last name like S., Ill likely never not be on The Root. Ok let\u2019s get to my application.\n\nI think I have finally figured out what irks me about your writing Michael. Well actually I shouldn\u2019t say writing, as you are a damn fine writer. I guess I should say, the content in your writing.\n\nI\u2019m not poor ol Dusty from the last set of clapbacks, and Im not gonna get offended by comments that you make. I\u2019m honestly too damn busy trying to pay my bills every month to get riled by an internet comment.\n\nWith that said, I think the issue I have with your writing is that you\u2019re coming across as just another provocateur, in what seems like an ever growing sea of provocateurs. A provocateur as I see it, only serves one purpose, and that\u2019s to stir the pot. Honestly I dont have any problem with stirring the pot, because that needs to happen from time to time, and it would seem it needs to happen often when it comes to social issues. The problem with provocateurs is that they never stop stirring for long enough for the change they provocate for to actually take place.\n\nNow obviously Im not saying that if you stop now, all of a sudden all of the racist bullshit out there is instantly going to vanish. That obviously does not hinge on your writing. What I am saying is that I wish the provocative nature of your writing could take a back seat more often now that the site has a pretty good base. I wish there was more writing on here about ideas to bring about change now that you have a voice with a platform and base that will hear you.\n\nYou can keep writing about the evils of Whitey till the sun burns out, and we both know it will continue to work from a blogging perspective. What it does not do however, is make a damn bit of difference. You and I are both now old enough to recognise that pointing out a wrong and getting people to recognize said wrong, does not mean that the wrong will be righted. I swear, if I hear one more god damn millennial say \u201cyou need to recognize...\u201d, I\u2019m going to lose my goddamn mind. As if their generation is the first to be cognisant of racial and social injustices, or that the simple recognition of those injustices will fix anything.\n\nWe now have roughly 3 generations of people that were brought up to recognise racial and social injustice. I think its safe to say that we have the numbers to bring on some level of change. Continuing to to simply ask for recognition at this point is about as useless as poor ol Dusty comment to you.\n\nI want to be clear that I am not trying to tell you what you should be doing with regard to your writing. I am trying to voice what I wish you and the rest of the writers at The Root would do more often. As I see it you can be content with being Flavor Flav, or you can be Public Enemy.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBill,\n\nThank you for finally enlightening me on this subject.\n\nI have received a million letters like yours, but you, in your eloquence, finally solved a puzzle that I have been unable to decipher.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am often asked this question or presented with this argument in various forms. Some of the most popular are:\n\nWhy must you always talk about racism all the time?\n\n\n\nWhy not offer solutions?\n\n\n\nTalking about race and prejudice only leads to more divisiveness.\n\n\n\nBut you\u2019ve figured it out for me, Bill. Because of your letter, I finally understand:\n\nWhite people have amnesia.\n\nYou\u2019re partially right, Bill: I often point the finger at white people when it comes to racism. But the idea that I or any writer at The Root never speaks about solutions is either a blatant attempt to ignore the facts or a goddamn lie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI will not call you a liar, Billy.\n\nBut if you are not a liar, then you are either stupid or you have a strain of forgetfulness I like to call sudden-onset Caucasian amnesia. Let\u2019s examine the facts:\n\nWhen I, or other writers, talk about the blatant, systematic racism in the criminal-justice system, white people accuse us of \u201cplaying the victim\u201d and not offering solutions. Either they are making the argument up, or white people\u2019s Wi-Fi can\u2019t download the incessant number of articles I and others writers here have written about how to change the criminal-justice system by voting, electing local prosecutors, getting engaged in activism, reorganizing the bail system and organizing communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow to Change the World We are so often overwhelmed with complex issues and bad news that it is easy to forget the impact\u2026 Read more Read\n\nWhen we talk about education disparities, apparently you skipped by the posts about HBCUs, reforming school districts or community-based education projects. We tried to make it simple for your white mind, Bill, by highlighting our list of black children excelling in education with our Young Futurists series. We put it on our banner. We shone a light on them. Perhaps you aren\u2019t an overly sensitive snowflake crying every time you see the word \u201cwhite people\u201d on a black site. Maybe you just missed it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen we talk about police violence, we offer solutions. When we discuss mass incarceration, we talk about ideas. We have written articles specifically aimed at white people who want to combat white supremacy.\n\nIn fact, there is not one single subject we have tackled here at The Root for which we have not addressed our own community about solving the problem among ourselves, whether it is inner-city crime, gang violence or bringing our own seasoning to white gatherings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour letter reminds me of the people who are anti-Black Lives Matter. Anyone who has ever lived in a black neighborhood will tell you that for every #BlackLivesMatter march, there are 10 Stop the Violence rallies. But Fox News never shows up at those events. Media outlets don\u2019t give them publicity, but they will point the camera at any white face willing to ask, \u201cBut what about black-on-black crime?\u201d\n\nEvery single day this place focuses on black excellence and highlights those who are engaged in eliminating white supremacy. We have criticized both black and white alike. If you don\u2019t see it, it\u2019s because you have chosen to remain willfully ignorant.\n\nOr maybe you\u2019re a goddamn liar.", "keywords": ["clapback", "sex", "roots", "dont", "talk", "mailbag", "writing", "root", "black", "white", "thanksgiving", "im", "say"], "polarity": 0.0361974573780129, "subjectivity": 0.4478799235743681},

I quickly quipped, \u201cThat nigga Jamaal be tripping,\u201d and everyone burst into laughter.\n\nJamaal got in my face and kindly informed me that he was going to kick my ass.

Jamaal is pretty big.\u201d\n\nThe next day, no one remembered me running home like a scared rat, but they remembered that joke I said about Jamaal. That\u2019s when I realized: A smart, witty retort is even better than kicking someone\u2019s ass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, that story is 100 percent fake. The following emails are 100 percent real. Blame Yesha.\n\n[Thank you; that was a good fable/introduction. \u2014Yesha]\n\nThe following is a direct message from a Twitter user named P0lymorphic:\n\n\n\nFrom: P0lymorphic\n\nTo: Michael Harriot You are aware hate crimes apply to all people. Not just people of color. https://www.theroot.com/when-the-irish-weren-t-white-1793358754 \u2026 this article is offensive, remove it or I\u2019ll call your local pd and file a complaint for hate crimes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear P0lymorphic,\n\nI rarely do this, but I am reaching out to you because I am confused. A few weeks ago we published an article about Nazi furries that engendered a furtwa against me. Every day since, I have received hate mail from people who like to dress up as magenta German shepherds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can see that your Twitter bio picture is some kind of animal in a Nazi uniform. Because of the past few weeks, that\u2019s not so weird. The crazy part is this: In your direct message accusing me of a \u201chate crime,\u201d you never mentioned furries, the alt-right furry article or anything about your polymorphism!\n\nThis leaves me with some questions for you, P0lymorphic. I hope you can provide some clear answers:\n\n\n\nWhy are you dressed up like an alt-right golden retriever? Look, I get it, we all have our preferences. I am not a human supremacist. I feel like blacks, whites, Hispanics, Asians and people who want to walk around like the love child of Sonic the Hedgehog and a Teletubbie all deserve the same rights. What puzzles me is why you want to marginalize others. Who are you specifically against? Black bears? Do you want to build a wall to keep out the chihuahuas coming here to take your furry jobs? Are you Homo (sapiens) phobic?\n\nAre you Irish? The link you provided is to an article about the false notion that the Irish were slaves. Was that a mistake, or are you willing to forgive me for making fun of your predilection for polymorphism, but the fact that I wrote about the Irish upsets you? What are you going to tell the police? When they come to your home to answer the complaint, will you be wearing your SS-officer fox outfit? Are you going to ... wait. I think I just figured it out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know what\u2019s going on. You\u2019re trying to fuck a police dog, aren\u2019t you, P0lymorphic? You\u2019re using my splendid name to lure an unsuspecting K-9 officer to your home so you can make sweet love to another animal in uniform.\n\nI refuse to be a part of your sick games, P0lymorphic. I see through your little ruse. Shame on you!\n\nThe next message is from the comment section for Monique Judge\u2019s article about why emotional maturity and emotional intelligence are important in healthy relationships:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear AluNoir:\n\nMonique\u2019s definitions of emotional intelligence and emotional maturity come directly from psychological definitions, specifically, Psychology Today. But it brings up a greater point about a subject we need to discuss: I don\u2019t think you\u2019re very emotionally intelligent or mature, AluNoir. I have never met you personally, so I am basing my conjecture on one theory:\n\nHit dogs.\n\nThere is an old Southern saying that goes, \u201cA hit dog will holler,\u201d meaning that when you say or do something to a group of people, the one who is offended will let it be known. This happens often at The Root. Allow me to present you with another recent example:\n\nThis week I wrote this article:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could easily find 10 comments that objected to the article, but I think the easiest way would be to just post this letter (that\u2019s right, you are about to see a clapback inside a clapback. That\u2019s some Inception-level shit):\n\nFrom: Kristi Z\n\nTo: Michael Harriot Michael, it\u2019s hard to understand how you could write an article about Trump calling Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas being racist and then call all white women Beckies. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s just as bad? Using your logic, if Trump using a traditional native American name as a slur means he hates Indians, does this means you hate all women? I can tell youdo but I want to hear you say it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAluNoir, Kristi is a Becky.\n\nShe makes a good point that, all things being equal, calling a woman \u201cPocahontas\u201d is the same as calling a white woman a \u201cBecky.\u201d But here is the thing\u2014and I\u2019m going to type it in all caps, which, in internet parlance, means I am yelling. Because I am about to yell:\n\nALL THINGS ARE NOT EQUAL!\n\nThat is the entire point of the term \u201cBecky.\u201d That is the entire point of the term \u201cwypipo.\u201d If the infinitely small dig of \u201cBecky\u201d and \u201cwypipo\u201d upsets you, then imagine how white supremacy must feel. Imagine how being labeled a \u201cthug\u201d feels. Or \u201cunderprivileged.\u201d Or \u201curban.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most important (here is where I tie the point up in a neat little bow), anyone who objects to the the truth of a psychological definition or a hackneyed joke of a quiz is probably a hit dog.\n\nAluNoir thinks that Monique must be living in an alternate reality because she believes in psychology. AluNoir believes that anyone who uses the actual definition of a term is delusional. AluNoir is emotionally unintelligent and emotionally immature. Alu Noir is a hit dog.\n\nJust like Kristi. Kristi literally believes that anyone who makes a joke about white women must obviously hate all women. According to Kristi, that is the only possible explanation. I mean ... who could possibly dislike white women, with their entitled attitudes and their credit-card-shaped buttocks?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy Kristi\u2019s standards, either I\u2019m a hater or there are people on this earth who actually believe that there are some white women whose entire existence is predicated on their privilege. Kristi can\u2019t fathom that it could possibly be the former, so it must be the latter. Kristi is a hit dog. Kristi is a Becky.\n\nI beg of you, AuNoir ...\n\nDon\u2019t be like Kristi.\n\nThe next letter is an email to one of our female writers. I have concealed her name in case there are others out there like this:\n\n\n\nFrom: Ron E.\n\nSubject: Your worn panties Would it be possible for you to sell me your worn panties? Please let me know.\n\nThank you kindly. XOXOX Ron\n\nDear Ron,\n\nFirst of all, I am jealous. I have been writing for The Root for quite a while and no one has solicited a pair of my boxers. Even though I am disappointed, I will let it go so that I can bring up another salient point:\n\nWhy, though?\n\nWhy do you want a pair of panties? More important, what endows you with the confidence to ask?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have often wondered how men like Louis C.K., Harvey Weinstein and Mark Halperin would think that a woman would want to see them masturbate. How could they pose questions like, \u201cYou wanna see me wash my bloated, fluorescent dad bod in the shower or watch me manhandle my penis like a bicycle pump?\u201d I have come up with a theory:\n\nIt works.\n\nI can\u2019t believe that these middle-aged men would continue to ask women these obscene questions if no one, at some point, said yes. Human nature doesn\u2019t work that way. Therefore, I have come up with a solution I call the \u201cThanksgiving rule.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you are a man, every Thanksgiving, you should gather your aunts, sisters, mother and grandmother in a room and reveal your sexual proclivities. Tell them, \u201cI\u2019m trying to find a woman who likes when a man grabs her breasts without asking.\u201d Ask them if they know a nice girl at their church who might be looking for a guy to furiously masturbate into their house plant.\n\nIf they look disgusted or throw mashed potatoes in your face, take that as a sign that you shouldn\u2019t do it to strangers. If you can\u2019t do it at home, don\u2019t do it in public.\n\nI think I just solved the entire sexual-misconduct crisis. That\u2019s what the mailbag is here for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.", "keywords": ["clapback", "tripping", "roots", "point", "hate", "article", "important", "wypipo", "think", "mailbag", "kristi", "women", "white", "jamaal", "thats"], "polarity": -0.0044653880070546735, "subjectivity": 0.49038800705467367},

While I love Anne, I, too, think she far too often writes about issues and news with a bias toward that nonsense people learn in college. I have spoken with her privately about using things like facts, scientific studies and research. She will never get anywhere in life doing that.\n\nDuring our impromptu counseling sessions, I\u2019ve told her that if she wants to be a \u201ctrue American\u201d like you, she must learn to get the truth from the one place where all real Americans find it: their guts.\n\nBut I could tell she was confused. See, Anne can\u2019t shake free from the indoctrination she received by getting an actual master\u2019s degree in journalism and instead adhere to the journalistic integrity of random yahoos who email her to tell her to go back to countries she\u2019s not from. You see, Anne has not come to the realization that there is a difference between \u201cthe truth\u201d and \u201cmy truth.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe has yet to comprehend the fact that we live in a post-truth society where one can deny climate change because it feels colder, or white people can grab tiki torches and commit acts of terror because they feel oppressed. I continue to work with Anne on this, but there\u2019s one other question that I\u2019d like to ask you:\n\nWhy did you feel the need to censor the word \u201cbitch\u201d? Did you think a woman would be OK with your calling her a \u201cstupid commie\u201d or a \u201craghead\u201d but then clutch her pearls when she read the word \u201cbitch\u201d? Are racism and xenophobia OK in your circle, but sexism is going too far? You\u2019re such a fucking gentleman, Ray.\n\nBut let\u2019s get back to Anne and what it means to be a \u201ctrue American,\u201d because I don\u2019t know what that means. When your parents, grandparents or great-grandparents came to this country, did they not become \u201ctrue Americans\u201d? How long does it take? Must Anne do something like steal land, kidnap blacks, rape, commit genocide or write asterisk-laced racist diatribes to people she disagrees with before she gets an invitation into your club of lying, murdering, raping, reneging thieves?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m asking for a Native American friend.\n\nOh and one more thing:\n\nYour mama\u2019s a b***h.\n\nDon\u2019t be offended; I didn\u2019t type it out. Plus, look at her son.\n\nHey man, that\u2019s just \u201cmy truth.\u201d\n\nThe next message was found in the hidden double-secret, filtered-message inbox:\n\nFrom: Shane G. Hey Michael, The things you are sharing are inappropriate and should not be on Facebook. Please take them down. You are a dumb prick who writes bullshit articles on a back ally site Also go fuck ya mother and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGotdammit, Shane!\n\nI wish I had gotten this message before I had that threesome with your mother and Ray O\u2019s! Now I\u2019m pretty much done with mother-fucking for the year.\n\nI blame Obama.\n\nP.S. This is just a joke. I don\u2019t want to be sued for slander or libel. Despite her numerous pleas, I have never had sexual intercourse with your mother. Plus, I would never insert my penis into the dry, wrinkled hole that gave life to anything like you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Jo\n\nSubject: No longer following NFL\n\nTo: Stephen Crocket Obviously that is a lie. Starting with a lie is a bad foundation. I am positive you never served your country in any way shape or form as Mr. Kaep has also not served. Also I am sure you will not allow me to tell you how to spend your money. Just as you can not tell any NFL owner how to spend theirs. NFL owners do not have to put out a good product because it is not necessary for them to do so to make millions. They have blind follows. It is always about money. I do not watch The NFL nor do I support what they stand for because starting from the owners, coaches and players they are all over paid for whatever skill,or talent people feel they have there by creating all this ego and false value. Just like writers like yourself and those you work with who continually spew out their praises. I understand Mr Kaep\u2019s cause and realize it is a worthy one but he should have picked a different a venue to express himself. Get a life and write about something else. Oh yes try to tell the truth a forgotten area in your chosen profession\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Jo,\n\nThank you for your service. (I don\u2019t know if you have ever served in the military\u2014I\u2019m talking about your service to whiteness.)\n\nHere\u2019s a surprise: I actually agree with you. You have every right to disagree with the Colin Kaepernick protest. It is supposed to upset you. That is the point of a protest. However ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat does not mean anyone has to give a fuck.\n\nDo you think Rosa Parks gave a fuck about the people who were going to be late on that Montgomery, Ala., bus? I bet Harriet Tubman never considered the slave owners\u2019 financial losses; nor did civil rights workers worry about the people who wanted to sit down and eat their grilled-cheese sandwiches at segregated lunch counters. When state troopers cracked John Lewis\u2019 skull open on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., I\u2019m sure, as he faded into darkness, that there is one thought that never crossed his mind:\n\n\u201cDamn, this is really going to screw up traffic.\u201d\n\nSo I\u2019m sorry that you wish Kaepernick had picked a different venue to protest. The next time a black mother is crying over the body of her son as the blood spills onto the concrete from the bullet piercings, I will be sure to send her a note asking:\n\n\u201cCan you pick a different venue to mourn?\u201d\n\nOne year ago this week, I was asked to mediate a microscopic difference of opinion (it wasn\u2019t really a beef) about the film The Birth of a Nation after a prominent news anchor (Roland Martin) disagreed with a writer at The Root (Yesha Callahan) who said that the film was a flop, saying that she was dancing on the film\u2019s grave. His comments resembled the sentiments of many black men that black feminists had doomed the movie, so I wrote this article:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter that piece was published, I received a lot of backlash, including this voice message, which is exactly 1 year old today.

But President Trump, whose proven himself to be the pettiest of bitches, commanded his personal top cop Jeff \u201cKing Keebler\u201d Sessions to fire McCabe.\n\n\n\nSessions waited until just before 10 p.m. to announce that McCabe, who would\u2019ve been eligible for his full pension in just one day, was going to be terminated, because the Trump administration is nothing if not dramatic.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, McCabe stepped down from his second in command post at the FBI earlier this year, but was still employed and was still fighting to keep his job as recently as Thursday. The Post notes that McCabe spent some four hours inside the Justice Department pleading his case.\n\nBut, like Simba\u2019s uncle Scar before him, Trump has proven himself to be an evil bitch. He just couldn\u2019t let McCabe bow out with his money. Nope, he just had to knee-cap him on his way out the door.\n\nThe Post notes that McCabe\u2019s firing comes after a general investigation found that he \u201cauthorized the disclosure of sensitive information to the media about a Clinton-related case, then misled investigators about his actions in the matter, people familiar with the matter have said.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cConsidering McCabe\u2019s number of years at the agency and estimations of his high-level pay grade, formulas published by the US Office of Personnel Management for law enforcement officers show that his yearly payout could hit in the area of $60,000 each year, if McCabe were to retire after his birthday on Sunday,\u201d CNN reports.\n\n\n\nThe Post reports that McCabe can seek legal action to try and get his pension wages, but good luck with that.

I know this sounds like some Inception-level shit where we make references to a mailbag inside a mailbag about the mailbag, so I will include some new stuff, too.\n\nLast week was a rough week for mail. I feel like you guys weren\u2019t bringing your racist A-game (the \u201ca\u201d stands for asswipe). I had to look for stuff to clap back at. I know it was the day after The Root 100 gala, and I may have awakened in my bed the next morning wearing a tuxedo jacket, formal shoes and no pants. I cannot confirm this, and also ... why are you being so nosy?\n\nLuckily, you guys really stepped up to the hate plate this week. I have received no less than 12 correspondences that contain the word \u201cnigger\u201d in them. While it does show a lack of creativity on the part of racists (400 years and \u201cnigger\u201d is the best you can do?*), it does set a new personal record for me.\n\nBravo, motherfuckers. Bravo.\n\nLet\u2019s read some mail:\n\n\n\n*I prefer the pure simplicity of \u201cporch monkey.\u201d\n\nThe following is a comment on Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan\u2019s article about a hair game, which some (white) people found very offensive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Mike Your just another niggger jealous of white people and pissed because you were born black, I would be to, you blacks snivel about everything and blame everyone else for your woes, but it is you who are to blame for the way people of all races see blacks and the way we see you is justified by the way people of all races see blacks and the way we see you is justified by the way blaks as a whole are, basically lie animals, all races really hate blacks, even blacks hate blacks and kill each other by the hunddreds every day, you wil alwasy be the scum of the earth and rightly so\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMike,\n\nIt is part of human nature to believe that everyone likes the same things and feels the same way you do. If you like a dish, how could anyone else not like it? If a joke makes you laugh, how could anyone else not think it\u2019s funny? The entire staff of The Root still can\u2019t wrap their minds around the idea that, after having tasted bacon, I think it is just \u201ca\u2019ight.\u201d They can\u2019t even process the concept. They have actually come to the conclusion that every time I\u2019ve tried it, it must have been fake bacon. Like there\u2019s an international conspiracy to slip mediocre pork products to Michael Harriot. It\u2019s probably beef lobbyists. Big beef must be behind it* (which, I must add, would be my stripper name). I said all of that to make this point, Mike:\n\nJust because you hate black people doesn\u2019t mean everyone hates black people.\n\nI know the concept is as mind-numbingly implausible as someone\u2019s being apathetic about eating pig thigh meat. I truly understand that so much hate is buried in the rancid, charcoal black muscle you call a heart that you think everyone in the world must obviously have the same despicable disposition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMike, you\u2019re not going to believe me when I say this, but trust me it\u2019s true: Not all white people are racist.\n\nNope. Trust me, it\u2019s true. In fact, I\u2019ll tell you another secret. There are even people in the world (I will admit, they\u2019re probably some kind of lexical geniuses or something) who use periods and all that fancy-schmancy punctuation shit. They even know the difference between \u201cyour\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re.\u201d\n\nNow, I\u2019m going to keep the grammar thing between you and me, because I intend to cite you as a source to every Caucasian crier who says, \u201cNot all white people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThanks, Mike.\n\nThanks,\n\nMike\n\n*That\u2019s what she said.\n\nFrom Twitter user BuildTheWall:\n\nThis comments related to article complaining to whites that bring up black on black crime. You said over 91% of blacks are killed by other blacks & most whites are murdered by other whites & failed to mention that 84% of whites are killed by other whites , blacks commit approximately 50% homicides in the U.S. every year & commit most crime at a much higher ratio / percent of other races. They burn towns / cities & then cry about needing everyone to give them something for free , they take over 35% welfare annually are only 13% - 15% of this nations population & shift the blame saying most welfare goes to whites. They are taught that only white people can be racist in some schools / colleges & this only makes race relations worse. Pointing out facts doesn\u2019t feel good does it? I am no racist & to be honest the world sucks. There will be no end to the shitholes that many poor or unemployed blacks live at in all major cities & poor black areas in general until welfare is cut off for many of them because a large percentage of them don\u2019t need it & just refuse to work like any other race. When you cut off welfare for those that can work & are just sitting home they\u2019ll to get off their asses & find a job. You have no idea how much better life would be for many people if they lost their welfare. I have seen major improvements in attitudes after they started working no matter their skin color. They were scared as hell at first & when they got a job their attitude was much better then when they were relying on welfare because they were able to get an apartment , had money to spend & got out of the shithole they were living in. My girlfriend was one of those black people that relied on welfare because she didn\u2019t want to work. I told her that she was only allowed to eat dollar store soup until she got a job & kept my food which was mainly meat & poultry was in a chest freezer. She left my food alone & found a job in only 1 week . When she got a job she was given a key to the chest freezer & allowed to eat whatever she wanted as long as she mentioned it if I was gone so I could replace it. She was also stuck at home & not able to go out until she got a job. You want to know what she did over it? She was angry at me about it until she got a job & thanked me for making her stay at home because she realized that\u2019s a little like how she was living for years & she no longer feels imprisoned like she was on welfare. She said the job gave her more freedom then she could have imagined & finally has some money to spend because of me. I overheard this when she was talking to a friend because she talks a little loud & th\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is so much to unpack here, so I won\u2019t. Instead, I would like to submit that this isn\u2019t one of the most racist things I\u2019ve ever received, but it is all the racist things I\u2019ve received. If someone wanted to know what kind of hate mail black writers get, this would be my prototype.\n\nIt is excellent in its sheer lack of fucks given about grammar. The way he refers to his arbitrarily derived statistics as \u201cfacts\u201d is baconlike in both taste and saltiness. But you know what my favorite part is? The way, smack dab in the middle of this verbal diarrhea, he says, \u201cI\u2019m no racist.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one of my favorite parts.\n\nI was actually going to include this letter in last week\u2019s mailbag, but last Friday\u2019s bag of bullshit ran pretty long, so I had totally forgotten about the part where he said he had a black girlfriend whom he trained to work and be responsible through a system of starvation and ass-whippings. (I know the DM didn\u2019t say anything about ass whippings, but y\u2019all know. ... You think this guy doesn\u2019t slap women around?) I am also still trying to wrap my head around the fact that an actual woman, with a vagina and everything, let him stick his flaccid, chicken-neck-looking, underdeveloped, thumb-shaped penis inside her. I guess even a trash can catches a steak some days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich brings me to my last point about the worst people on the planet. I know I talk about racism very often, but there is a class of people who are worse than racists: the motherfuckers who put locks on refrigerators.\n\nIf Hitler\u2019s Third Reich had been limited to these motherfuckers, he would have been hailed as a hero. I\u2019ve always heard about these people, but even this brief, momentary contact makes me want to take one of those Silkwood showers where I scrub my skin really hard with a medium-bristle wire brush and then sit on the floor of the shower with my arms wrapped around my legs thinking about the complexities of the human condition and why they don\u2019t make Pop-Tarts without the icing anymore as my tears slowly dissolve down the drain.\n\nSee what I go through for y\u2019all?\n\nThe following are two comments left on last week\u2019s mailbag from a user named Dusty. Dusty was apparently triggered by me saying, \u201cWhite people are evil.\u201d\n\nI like to pop in from time to time to see how other folks view the world who aren\u2019t like me and I have not posted until now. You write that all white people are evil and then try to make a nuanced explanation, but in the end, had a white person said \u201call black people are evil\u201d regardless of the explanation, they would immediately be branded a racist. How do you justify pointing out all the anti-black racism when many comments and articles on this site are anti-white? How do you expect a white person to act when you put your thumb in their eye at every opportunity?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDusty later wrote:\n\nSo you think saying all white people are evil is appropriate? How about all black people are evil?\n\nDearest Dusty,\n\nSorry for putting my thumb in your eye. I\u2019m also sorry that your anus is still so sore from me saying, \u201cWhite people are evil\u201d that you missed the entire point of last week\u2019s mailbag.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd you\u2019re right, by the way. If a white person had said, \u201cAll black people are evil,\u201d I would have assumed they were racist. I probably wouldn\u2019t have typed a letter or comment to the site where they said it, though. I wouldn\u2019t have done it for one particular reason:\n\nIf I were browsing that imaginary site that said, \u201cBlack people are evil,\u201d I bet it would have a million stories on it. I would imagine that it had stories about crime, racism, inequality, injustice, death, satire, politics, pop culture and even achievements. After I perused through all of the other worldviews that are different from mine, the thing I would have been offended by the least (or at least not enough to toggle me into \u201cletter-writing mode\u201d) was someone saying, \u201cBlack people are evil.\u201d Would you like to know why?\n\nBecause I am not evil.\n\nI know it\u2019s hard dealing with the racism against white people. I\u2019ve felt it, too. Last year, while filling out my taxes, I told my son to get his registration so I could see how much I paid to register his car. I walked to the garage with him, and when he fumbled around in the glove compartment searching for the right paper, I yelled at him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wasn\u2019t being mean, but in that moment, all I could think about was, \u201cWhat if the wrong cop was standing over this black kid fumbling around in his glove compartment?\u201d That stupid little moment of teenage carelessness could cost my son his life\u2014because he is black.\n\nIt is a tough thing to wrestle with, watching your children, knowing the more they grow, the more they become prey. It is scary to think about that every time they leave the house. And then I thought, I bet this is just how Dusty feels when he reads words on the internet.\n\nSee? Our battles with racism are the same, Dusty.\n\nBut there is something else in your comments that I\u2019d like to point out:\n\nI said, \u201cWhite people are evil.\u201d\n\nYou asked, \u201cSo you think saying all white people are evil is appropriate?\u201d\n\nYou also wrote, \u201cYou write that all white people are evil and then try to make a nuanced explanation ... \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you notice the difference in those sentences, Dusty?\n\nYou added an \u201call.\u201d I didn\u2019t say \u201call,\u201d Dusty. Thank you for clearing this up for me. Now I understand everything. For so long I\u2019ve been accusing the \u201cnot all white people\u201d crowd of being too sensitive and privileged, but now I understand.\n\nWhite people can\u2019t read!\n\nNow that you\u2019ve pointed it out to me, it\u2019s clear, Dusty! Thank you for that.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying that \u201call\u201d white people are illiterate. Just some. The ones who compare comments on the internet to 400 years of rape, torture, injustice, murder and inequality. The ones so dumb they actually think they can convince people that they are open-minded and sophisticated enough to cruise the internet to hear opinions different from their own, but so sensitive they can\u2019t handle opinions different from their own. The ones so privileged they think they can actually tell people that their opinions aren\u2019t \u201cappropriate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot all white people, Dusty.\n\nJust you.\n\nHey, Mike said it, not me.", "keywords": ["clapback", "evil", "roots", "mailbags", "blacks", "think", "saying", "mailbag", "know", "welfare", "black", "white", "job", "way"], "polarity": -0.06077503969763386, "subjectivity": 0.48780286426729924},

Crockett Jr. and me:\n\nFrom: Peanut the Stepchild\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: You aint shit I read your article calling Malcolm Jenkins a sellout. What i need to know is how is he a sellout? He got $100 millions ofdollars for black causes? That money will help alot of people. Maybe you\u2019re the sellout. I know you\u2019re an Omega, as is he. How could you sell your frat brother out for clicks? What I\u2019d like to know is: what are you doing for black people besides bitching on the internet. It is brothers like you who criticize your own people that keep us down, not Malcolm Jenkins who is trying to solve the problem. Maybe if you get off your ass and do something he wouldn\u2019t have to \u201csell us out\u201d as you call it. Coons like you are the worst.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this direct message from Twitter:\n\nFrom: DamnDamnDamnJames I liked your argument about the NFL players alot. I\u2019m #teammicheal on this one. Niggas like Stephen Crockett should just die so real niggas can actually make some moves. Don\u2019t fuck with that nigga. Porch monkeys like him will sell you out like he thinks the players should sell out. Keep doint your thing black man.\n\nHey, James, calm down. As far as the NFL players are concerned, Stephen and I are in agreement: The players shouldn\u2019t have taken the money. I don\u2019t understand how they even came to that conclusion. When I initially found out about it, I contacted Stephen (because he is our sports editor) and we had a long conversation about it into the wee hours of the night. Actually, it was about 11 p.m., but still.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth of us were conflicted on the subject, and we thought the best way to enunciate both sides of the issue was to pick a side and debate it. Stephen just lost the coin flip. In truth, Stephen asked me which side I wanted to write because he knew he was good enough to write either side. That shit kinda threw me off for a minute, like when a dude smiles and nicely invites you outside to fight.\n\nAnd Peanut (may I call you Peanut, or is it Mr. Stepchild?), what the hell will $100 million do for injustice and inequality? Here\u2019s what you should do: Call Sybrina Fulton and ask her how much it would take for her to stop crying at the image of her son in a casket. Ask Michael Brown Sr. if it would have made everything OK if Darren Wilson had written him a check before pumping bullets into his son\u2019s body.\n\nNot everything is for sale. The only people who think like that are broke motherfuckers and white people. However, I don\u2019t blame you or the owners. Both of you fit into one of those two categories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore I close, I would like to recommend that both of you come up with better slurs. In this new age of white supremacy, \u201cporch monkey\u201d and \u201ccoon\u201d are so pedestrian. I think you can do better. How about \u201cmoon cricket\u201d? No one ever says \u201cmoon cricket\u201d anymore. Or better yet, I think the trendy new term \u201cdindu\u201d might fit even better. White people love it because\u2014as they say\u2014when black thugs are arrested, they always say, \u201cI dindu nuthin\u2019.\u201d\n\nFinally, I won\u2019t comment on the part about me criticizing my fraternity brother. When I criticize white people, white people call me racist. When I criticize black people, black people call me a sellout. But absolutely no one will call me a Kappa. I won\u2019t stand for it.\n\nDespite your passion, we take your criticism with a grain of salt. There is, however, one very important thing I wanted to point out about both of your messages that absolutely infuriated both Stephen and me:\n\n\u201cAlot\u201d is not a word.\n\nMany people were mad about the article explaining why Donald Trump was racist for using the name \u201cPocahontas\u201d as a slur.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this direct message from a friend of mine:\n\nFrom: Baby Team, there will be no outcry at all if President Obama had called her the same thing. I find it disingenuous on her part to claim Indian Heritage and then get mad when she is referred to by the name of an Indian heroine. IJS\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Dawn, LoDuv and Baby,\n\nMy article was not about the hypocrisy of Elizabeth Warren. She grates on my nerve simply because she talks like a kindergarten teacher trying to show you how to write a cursive letter \u201cB,\u201d but that was not the point of this piece.\n\nI can\u2019t get mad at Elizabeth Warren when I know at least 137 black people who say they have \u201cIndian\u201d in them with no proof except what their grandparents or parents told them. Plus, they have a good grade of hair, so they must be Cherokee. I was writing about the slur, not Warren.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as for the claim that Warren uses Pocahontas.com, someone else did that. Anyone can redirect traffic to a site. In fact, I might forward all tweets from Dawn and LoDuv to StupidMotherFuckersWhoComeAtMeOnTwitter.com.\n\nLet me check to see if the domain name is available.\n\nFrom: Che\n\nTo: Michael H. I think you are funny, but I don\u2019t get why you coon for white people when you write. That thanksgiving writeup was funny, but it makes black people look bad. We are not a monolith.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChe,\n\nYou could\u2019ve stopped at \u201cThat thanksgiving writeup was funny.\u201d I understand how some think it reduces us to a stereotype. I try not to do that, but some things are true. White people make worse potato salad. Black people like sweet potato pie. I am often criticized for using black tropes because of something I like to call \u201clow black esteem.\u201d\n\nLow black esteem is a term I coined to explain when black people feel the need to polish the black parts of themselves to make themselves palatable for white people. We won\u2019t eat fried chicken in public. We cut watermelon into cubes. We code-switch. We turn the volume down on our blackness, not because white people will be offended, but because we want to be simply seen as human. Colorless. Like them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere is the thing, Che:\n\nI am not like them.\n\nI do not feel the need to filter my blackness with a soft lens or hide it behind the gossamer curtain of respectability. Here is the premise of the \u201cCaucasian Guides\u201d and every joke I tell: We are not different. They are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s it. I don\u2019t have low black esteem. I believe our culture, and black people in general, to be the standard upon which everything is built (or stolen from). I don\u2019t talk \u201cblack.\u201d They talk white. I feel no need to suppress anything about myself, no matter how stereotypical it may seem. I love black people so much, I wish I could kiss every gloriously thick, syrupy part of blackness, including our Hotep cousins and our drunk uncles. It is not a joke. It is real. That\u2019s what makes it funny. And if you don\u2019t think it is ...\n\nI bet I won\u2019t catch you eating their potato salad.", "keywords": ["clapback", "write", "roots", "players", "potato", "pocahontas", "need", "dont", "think", "mailbag", "know", "porch", "salad", "black", "white", "stephen", "monkeys", "wont"], "polarity": 0.006496645847790896, "subjectivity": 0.4777775023958227},

It\u2019s not that we didn\u2019t receive a lot of hate mail this week. (Don\u2019t worry; we won\u2019t ever run out of shitty comments from disgruntled readers of The Root\u2014ever). It\u2019s just that answering more than one piece of email this week would be redundant and stupid, and here is why:\n\nThis week we received the greatest piece of hate mail of all time.\n\nI don\u2019t like overhyping things. When guys, say, tell women they are going to \u201cmake you scream all night,\u201d they usually take the woman home, give her 4 minutes and 30 seconds of frantic \u201cWhose pussy is this?\u201d thrusting, followed by a deep slumber. That is not what we are doing here today.\n\nSometimes, for comic effect or to make a point, I will use hyperbole, but I\u2019m for real this time\u2014you about to read the whitest email ever written. It is not so much hate mail as it is white mail.\n\nOK, to be honest, it is pretty hateful, but it also embodies every piece of whiteness that has ever existed. It is a condensation of every microscopic molecule of Caucasianness. When I talk about \u201cwypipo,\u201d this is who I meant. We now have a mascot. The email is epic in its level of paleness and lack of melaninity. It is all the white things! When you read it, you will feel ...\n\nYou know what? Let\u2019s just read the letter.\n\nFrom: Nancy\n\nTo: Michael\n\nSubject: Your vile, sick, self deluded article Hey Michael Regarding your hateful rant about white people. If you think we are so bad you really need to go back to your African homeland where your own tribal leaders and ancestors pimped you for profit to jewish ship owners. Nothing to do with white europeans you despise so much. In Africa your honeland youll find they still never got civilized but there are cannibal warlords in Liberia. As Ben Carson said, a decent black man who excelled in a white mans world.\u201d the best thing that ever happen to the black man was slavery as it gave them the opportunity they would have never had in Africa\u201d you guys benefit from our civilization and our inventions. Cars, planes, trains, phones, electricity, tv, radio, archetecture. Roman and greek civlization is western civilization and Im sorry your ancestors are sad ass voo doo cannibals who never made a civlization.. Deal with it instead of hate and blame. Obama is a MuslIm which is very odd as Islam are the first to enslave your black ass. Go to Islam see what they still do to blacks today. So you should be thanking white men. We let you become millionairs in our society, Presidents, educated. Your complaining is vile and makes you unworthy. As far as crime. Lets face the facts. 40, 000 white women arr raped a year by black mren. White men dont rape black women. Wonder why? 300,000 black on white crimes a year. It is racial targeted hate. We cant help we are a beautiful intelligent race. But your acts of violence are transparent. We dont protest the way you people do as we have jobs. Not on welfare. In Japan during Fukishmi not one act of violence or looting. An honorable people. Katrina and other Us disaster its your breathen doing the looting not whites. It appears to me \u201cMichael\u201d sadly the name of a great warrior archangel you disgrace with your racial hate, jealosy, lies, and most import self delusions. What you are inciting with your so called \u201cpoetry\u201d is that of your voo doo ancestors demonic verbal diarrhea . Id like to look you in the eys and expel your bullshit out of you. Your a disgrace to humanity and ungrateful trash. Like your islamic Breathen foul and unholy Obama.You will fall from your throne of hate and deceit and lies soon enough by the wrath of God. May i suggest you go to church and pray rather than hating on white peopke and twisting the reality. You could never make a civlization absent us and now think your going to slander us the hijack and get unearned credit. Well try. When we fight back I assure you we will win as we always do since the history of time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHey, Nancy,\n\nFirst of all, when you talk about my vile, racist rant against white people, it would be helpful if you pointed out which one. How am I supposed to know? That would be like going to a place where white people go (like Yankee Candle or wherever y\u2019all buy those Caucasian-fit jeans) and asking, \u201cMay I speak to a racist?\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not why I selected your letter for mailbag honors. I chose this letter because I love you, Nancy. I want to meet you and marry you. I want you by my side for the rest of my life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd not for any romantic reasons, Nancy. My love for you is really selfish. From here to eternity, whenever I speak about racism, hate and the laughable fragility of wypipo and someone objects, I only wish that I would be able to say, \u201cHave you met my wife, Nancy?\u2019\n\nThe way your well-greased whiteness slid effortlessly from a \u201cGo back to Africa\u201d into a diatribe about black rapists, directly into a \u201cYou were better off as slaves,\u201d then transitioned into a lazy, welfare-nigga stereotype, may have been the most difficult combination of fucktastic bigotry I have ever witnessed on a page. I allowed David Duke to read your letter, and he was like, \u201cDamn, that bitch is racist!\u201d\n\nAnd where the fuck did the \u201cObama is a Muslim\u201d part come in? I gotta admit, Nancy, that shit came out of nowhere. It surprised me because I thought you were going in a whole different direction, but then you pivoted on me and wedged a little Islamophobia in there. And you prefaced it with a Ben Carson reference. And the subtle anti-Semitism of blaming slavery on the Jews was revelatory. It\u2019s rare to find respectability, white supremacy, Jew hate and Muslim hate right next to one another, without a new paragraph or anything. Well played, Nancy. Well played.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, Nancy, I hate to point this out, but they would fire me at The Root if I didn\u2019t. If I didn\u2019t ask the following question, Editor-in-Chief Danielle Belton would call me into her office and ask me what the hell was wrong with me. She would probably stage an intervention, so I am compelled to ask:\n\nWhere the fuck is Islam?\n\nYou said I should \u201c[g]o to Islam and see what they still do to blacks today\u201d? How? I went on Travelocity and couldn\u2019t find a direct flight to Islam. Could you tell me the nearest airport? Do they have hotels, or would I need an Airbnb? There are so many questions I have, but we don\u2019t have enough time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf I were to clap back at this letter (which I won\u2019t because I\u2019m praying that you and I become pen pals), I would dispel that whole notion about the scourge of black men raping white women by telling you to read this article:\n\nBut I would never do that, because I know you don\u2019t read, Nancy. Plus, I\u2019m not clapping back at you, remember? If I were, I\u2019d ask you how you could tell black people that you are not responsible for the sins of your ancestors and then turn around and take credit for all of Western civilization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt defies logic, but then again, I know you didn\u2019t enslave me, Nancy. I am 100 percent clear that you had nothing to do with slavery, even though you somehow made slavery Barack Obama\u2019s fault. (Again, I can\u2019t stop thinking about the Obama part. Bravo, Nancy.)\n\nYou know what else I know, Nancy? I know you didn\u2019t invent shit, either. You couldn\u2019t build a boat, a house or a civilization. You can barely build a shitty email.\n\nI\u2019ll admit that you have personally never done anything to me, but I know you have done something to someone black, Nancy, simply by existing. Simply by believing that you \u201clet\u201d us be millionaires and president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore I go, since we are in the mood to take credit, allow me to take credit for something my people have given to mediocre white women whom Darwinian evolution should have stamped out long ago. Allow me to pat myself on the back for the one thing that my people have \u201clet\u201d vile, disgusting, barely literate bitches like you be:\n\nAlive.", "keywords": ["clapback", "nancy", "roots", "hate", "dont", "mailbag", "know", "read", "didnt", "women", "whitest", "email", "black", "white", "im"], "polarity": -0.050368051260908424, "subjectivity": 0.4903705421562561},

But President Trump, whose proven himself to be the pettiest of bitches, commanded his personal top cop Jeff \u201cKing Keebler\u201d Sessions to fire McCabe.\n\n\n\nSessions waited until just before 10 p.m. to announce that McCabe, who would\u2019ve been eligible for his full pension in just one day, was going to be terminated, because the Trump administration is nothing if not dramatic.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, McCabe stepped down from his second in command post at the FBI earlier this year, but was still employed and was still fighting to keep his job as recently as Thursday. The Post notes that McCabe spent some four hours inside the Justice Department pleading his case.\n\nBut, like Simba\u2019s uncle Scar before him, Trump has proven himself to be an evil bitch. He just couldn\u2019t let McCabe bow out with his money. Nope, he just had to knee-cap him on his way out the door.\n\nThe Post notes that McCabe\u2019s firing comes after a general investigation found that he \u201cauthorized the disclosure of sensitive information to the media about a Clinton-related case, then misled investigators about his actions in the matter, people familiar with the matter have said.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cConsidering McCabe\u2019s number of years at the agency and estimations of his high-level pay grade, formulas published by the US Office of Personnel Management for law enforcement officers show that his yearly payout could hit in the area of $60,000 each year, if McCabe were to retire after his birthday on Sunday,\u201d CNN reports.\n\n\n\nThe Post reports that McCabe can seek legal action to try and get his pension wages, but good luck with that.

The reality is that the cafe has the right not to give Black kids candy. It is their cafe. The same way you have the right to open a cage next door that will compete against this \u201cracist cafe.\u201d Or the right not to shop at that cafe. The only way to gain your respect is to build your own and stop complaining about racism. The fact is there are no government institutions in the USA in 2017 that will block African American or Black Americans from starting a competing cafe or any other business for that matter. Yes there are individual people who are racists, but that will never change.What needs to change is the victim attitude and playing the race card. The race card is lame and no one is listening or cares cause our community is not respected. America is the greatest country for economic opportunity and mobility. Plan and work harder and smarter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMadril,\n\nI don\u2019t know how to tell you this in a tactful way, so I will just go ahead and say it because you aren\u2019t aware of the truth behind this statement:\n\nWhite people are evil.\n\nAfter reading your bullshit reasoned explanation, I was hesitant about making such a broad generalization. I even deleted and rewrote the sentence a few times. Then I realized that someone had to tell Madril. Maybe it should be me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore you get upset about me painting white people with such a broad brush, I want you to know that I don\u2019t think all white people are evil. According to my rough calculations, the percentage of evil white people is about the same as the ratio of poisonous snakes or venomous spiders to their respective populations overall. Now, I could take a course in herpetology and learn how to differentiate the killer snakes from the harmless ones, but just to be safe, I don\u2019t fuck with snakes.\n\nI know you don\u2019t want to think your people are evil, Madril. Neither do I. At first I tried to convince myself that maybe it was just Madril. Maybe Satan ejaculated into a shitbag of a human being who just happened to be ovulating, and 13 months later, out popped Madril (I think there is a longer gestation period for tiny pieces of toilet asswipe clotted with dried remnants of day-old diarrhea manifested in human form. I\u2019m pretty sure I read that in a medical journal), but then I thought, \u201cNah ... it\u2019s white people.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not your fault, Madril. You were enabled by your evil peers. I doubt that you are even aware of your evilness. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure of it. I\u2019m not shocked that you actually sat down and wrote a letter that used free-market economics to rationalize literally taking candy from babies\u2014any evil individual could do that. But you sent it to someone, Madril! The fact that you released it into the wild for all the world to see is proof that your people have normalized it until you are unaware of how vile you are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though you are a trash human being, don\u2019t despair. There is always room in this world for demons like you. I mean, it was your people who came up with the idea to combine two of the most despicable activities and ruin the world by simultaneously raping and pillaging. You used white-people-ing economics to justify colonization, genocide and the trans-Atlantic slave trade, so why not use it to explain how you fucked over babies who just wanted to trick-or-treat?\n\nSo go out there and keep shitting on toddlers, Madril. Keep on tricking. Keep on injecting poison into the world.\n\nMake your people proud.\n\nThis comment from \u201cSweetJamesJones\u201d is from The Root staffer Danielle Young\u2019s (I don\u2019t know her title, but I think it\u2019s either \u201cdope person\u201d or \u201cexecutive in charge of making fun of that one time Michael Harriot had on too much lip balm\u201d) brave article this week about her experience with famous men:\n\nAs a guy, I just want to say that this is tough. I want to be clear that the guys who did this stuff was wrong, but men are left in a Catch-22. I\u2019m sure I will be eviscerated, but here goes the reasoning. First, a lot of women love that type of attention. They feel it is complimentary, and it makes them feel wanted. Maybe all women are uncomfortable and not saying anything, but that\u2019s highly unlikely. Secondly, men have to pursue women, but there are no guidelines to doing so. All women have a different tolerance for flirting and contact. If a guy never makes an advance, he never gets a woman. If he comes in weak and respectful, some women will hate that. If he comes on strong, some women will see it as harrassment. As a guy, I\u2019m perplexed as to what to do as some women would feel uncomfortable if you simply ask them on a date. Instead of simply calling out these guys, can people actually come up with clear direction on how guys should act. Finally, Weinstein and others were clearly wrong. I am not defending that, but this seems like they simply found you attractive and wanted a chance. Its in a grey area.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSweetJamesJones,\n\nYou know how I just eviscerated Madril a few seconds ago? Well, after careful consideration, in light of the revelations about Jesse Jackson, John Singleton, Harvey Weinstein, Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore and, now, Louis C.K., I think I need to say this:\n\nMen are trash.\n\nI know women say that shit all the time as if it were a joke, but they have no idea the percentage of men who are shit bags who should be tossed on the trash heap of humanity. We ain\u2019t shit. None of us. Myself included.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYep, I ain\u2019t shit, either, SweetJamesJones. If I wasn\u2019t a piece of human garbage, my knuckles would be bleeding from punching motherfuckers like you in their fuckboy mouths. When I read about people like Bill Cosby, R. Kelly or Harvey Weinstein, I\u2019m not even shocked, because every man knows multiple other nonfamous men who do the same thing (minus the asking women if they can masturbate in front of them. That\u2019s strictly a white-boy thing). But we don\u2019t say shit because we aren\u2019t shit.\n\nSo you\u2019re saying men don\u2019t know where to draw the line for sexual harassment because some women like it? What kind of idiotic statement is that? There is a small minority of people who like everything, SweetShitJones. I know a woman who likes ketchup on her eggs, but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t an atrocity. I once saw heard about a documentary on this streaming site called Pornhub about a man who became sexually excited from women defecating on him. He liked it. So would it be OK if a woman shit in your mouth without asking you, SweetJamesJones?\n\nJames, you say there are no guidelines to pursuing women. But there are. I\u2019ll tell you where the line is:\n\nStop. Being. White. People.\n\nSexism is just like racism, James. Only white people and toxic motherfuckers like you think in those selfish terms of not giving a damn about how anyone feels as long as you can ejaculate at the end of the encounter. You can\u2019t rape and enslave whole human beings because you want to have an orgasm or own a plantation, James. That\u2019s evil, man. There is just no other way to say it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know what the fucked-up thing is, James?\n\nI believe you don\u2019t know where the line is. I believe you were being sincere. I believe Madril was being sincere. Madril doesn\u2019t feel like he hates black people, and you don\u2019t believe you hate women. At least Madril is just taking literal candy.\n\nBut just as Madril believes racism is a byproduct of normal society, you believe sexual harassment is a byproduct of your inherent male right to stick your dick into a moist hole\u2014all other humans be damned. The line is you, James. You are already across it because you think there is actually a line where you can almost sexually harass someone, but not quite!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoddamn, man, what the fuck is wrong with you?\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with us?\n\nWe ain\u2019t shit.\n\nDamn, damn, damn, James.\n\nI\u2019m out.", "keywords": ["clapback", "roots", "think", "dont", "mailbag", "area", "know", "gray", "women", "black", "white", "im", "say", "shit", "madril"], "polarity": -0.02480267748124891, "subjectivity": 0.490844671201814},

Instead of clapping back at the people who send emails, tweets and direct messages, we would like to thank our haters, because without them, where would we be?\n\nAs you sit back munching on your leftover dressing and sweet-potato-pie sandwich (don\u2019t judge me; I\u2019m just trying to eliminate waste by recycling), remember that whatever you do in life, if you don\u2019t have haters, you\u2019re doing it wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet us commence with the clapping:\n\nOur first correspondences this week refer to a story we recently published about Nazi furries. The community of furries (not to be confused with the furry community\u2014people with an excessive amount of back hair) was very upset about our post on the trend of alt-right anthropomorphic cosplayers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Buddy\n\nTo: The Root Tips First off spreading lies about something you have little to no information about, and using a photo completely out of context, On of the suiters is a partially deaf gay man, there is just as much Nazi propaganda in the furry community and there is in a loaf of bread. This is why only certain news outlets grow enough to recognised, they don\u2019t lie nor spread rumor to get attenchen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Furries:\n\nFirst, allow me to thank you for reaching out to me. I am delighted to share this open dialogue with you and your community. I hope The Root can become a place where people of all costumes can come together and exist in unity, no matter their fur or made-up species.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, I would like to say that, as an equal opportunity site, we would never limit people from doing what they believe. As such, I want to clarify our belief that the phenomenon of \u201cwhite-people shit\u201d is not limited to people of the Caucasian persuasion. Yes, a nonwhite gay man can, indeed, participate in white-people shit.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the term was not coined to besmirch the activities enjoyed by taupe Americans. It was meant to praise their imagination, unfettered by the fear of being marginalized or categorized. Our wish for humanity is that we all, one day, can enjoy the privilege of participating in white-people shit.\n\nI do, however, object to your belief that having sex with a black man means that you cannot be a racist. History is filled with examples to the contrary. Slaveholders routinely had sex with slaves while upholding the tenets of white supremacy. There are many incidents of white women who had consensual sex with black men and then pointed lynch mobs in the direction of their lovers. Racism and interracial sex are not mutually exclusive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI, on the other hand, uphold your right to have sex with whomever you choose. Whether it be a black man or a fuchsia fox wearing a Nazi-inspired armband, if you like it, I love it.\n\nJust remember to use protection. I don\u2019t want you to get rabies.\n\nFrom: Chantel\n\nTo: Michael Harriot I read your article on Black Thanksgiving. I love your writing, but would like you to know that not everything is about race.Stuff like Thanksgiving is universal. Your aritcles about black thanksgiving is so similar to white thanksgiving. We might not eat the same kind of food, and our relatives might be slightly diferent in the way we treat each other, but everything els is exactly alike. I am white, but I recognized almost everything in your article. If The only difference in me and you is what we call our aunts and how we like our macarone, then we might not be so different afger all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Chantel,\n\nYou might want to look up the definition of the words \u201cexactly alike.\u201d\n\nThanks.\n\nFrom: Bill S.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot Hello Michael, I\u2019d like to apologize for contracting you on your personal email address.\n\nTried to find a method of contact on the site, but an email address for writing submissions was all I could find in the way of contact. I also posted this in reply to your last Clapback posting, but I\u2019m a member of the Greys and with a last name like S., Ill likely never not be on The Root. Ok let\u2019s get to my application.\n\nI think I have finally figured out what irks me about your writing Michael. Well actually I shouldn\u2019t say writing, as you are a damn fine writer. I guess I should say, the content in your writing.\n\nI\u2019m not poor ol Dusty from the last set of clapbacks, and Im not gonna get offended by comments that you make. I\u2019m honestly too damn busy trying to pay my bills every month to get riled by an internet comment.\n\nWith that said, I think the issue I have with your writing is that you\u2019re coming across as just another provocateur, in what seems like an ever growing sea of provocateurs. A provocateur as I see it, only serves one purpose, and that\u2019s to stir the pot. Honestly I dont have any problem with stirring the pot, because that needs to happen from time to time, and it would seem it needs to happen often when it comes to social issues. The problem with provocateurs is that they never stop stirring for long enough for the change they provocate for to actually take place.\n\nNow obviously Im not saying that if you stop now, all of a sudden all of the racist bullshit out there is instantly going to vanish. That obviously does not hinge on your writing. What I am saying is that I wish the provocative nature of your writing could take a back seat more often now that the site has a pretty good base. I wish there was more writing on here about ideas to bring about change now that you have a voice with a platform and base that will hear you.\n\nYou can keep writing about the evils of Whitey till the sun burns out, and we both know it will continue to work from a blogging perspective. What it does not do however, is make a damn bit of difference. You and I are both now old enough to recognise that pointing out a wrong and getting people to recognize said wrong, does not mean that the wrong will be righted. I swear, if I hear one more god damn millennial say \u201cyou need to recognize...\u201d, I\u2019m going to lose my goddamn mind. As if their generation is the first to be cognisant of racial and social injustices, or that the simple recognition of those injustices will fix anything.\n\nWe now have roughly 3 generations of people that were brought up to recognise racial and social injustice. I think its safe to say that we have the numbers to bring on some level of change. Continuing to to simply ask for recognition at this point is about as useless as poor ol Dusty comment to you.\n\nI want to be clear that I am not trying to tell you what you should be doing with regard to your writing. I am trying to voice what I wish you and the rest of the writers at The Root would do more often. As I see it you can be content with being Flavor Flav, or you can be Public Enemy.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBill,\n\nThank you for finally enlightening me on this subject.\n\nI have received a million letters like yours, but you, in your eloquence, finally solved a puzzle that I have been unable to decipher.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am often asked this question or presented with this argument in various forms. Some of the most popular are:\n\nWhy must you always talk about racism all the time?\n\n\n\nWhy not offer solutions?\n\n\n\nTalking about race and prejudice only leads to more divisiveness.\n\n\n\nBut you\u2019ve figured it out for me, Bill. Because of your letter, I finally understand:\n\nWhite people have amnesia.\n\nYou\u2019re partially right, Bill: I often point the finger at white people when it comes to racism. But the idea that I or any writer at The Root never speaks about solutions is either a blatant attempt to ignore the facts or a goddamn lie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI will not call you a liar, Billy.\n\nBut if you are not a liar, then you are either stupid or you have a strain of forgetfulness I like to call sudden-onset Caucasian amnesia. Let\u2019s examine the facts:\n\nWhen I, or other writers, talk about the blatant, systematic racism in the criminal-justice system, white people accuse us of \u201cplaying the victim\u201d and not offering solutions. Either they are making the argument up, or white people\u2019s Wi-Fi can\u2019t download the incessant number of articles I and others writers here have written about how to change the criminal-justice system by voting, electing local prosecutors, getting engaged in activism, reorganizing the bail system and organizing communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow to Change the World We are so often overwhelmed with complex issues and bad news that it is easy to forget the impact\u2026 Read more Read\n\nWhen we talk about education disparities, apparently you skipped by the posts about HBCUs, reforming school districts or community-based education projects. We tried to make it simple for your white mind, Bill, by highlighting our list of black children excelling in education with our Young Futurists series. We put it on our banner. We shone a light on them. Perhaps you aren\u2019t an overly sensitive snowflake crying every time you see the word \u201cwhite people\u201d on a black site. Maybe you just missed it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen we talk about police violence, we offer solutions. When we discuss mass incarceration, we talk about ideas. We have written articles specifically aimed at white people who want to combat white supremacy.\n\nIn fact, there is not one single subject we have tackled here at The Root for which we have not addressed our own community about solving the problem among ourselves, whether it is inner-city crime, gang violence or bringing our own seasoning to white gatherings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour letter reminds me of the people who are anti-Black Lives Matter. Anyone who has ever lived in a black neighborhood will tell you that for every #BlackLivesMatter march, there are 10 Stop the Violence rallies. But Fox News never shows up at those events. Media outlets don\u2019t give them publicity, but they will point the camera at any white face willing to ask, \u201cBut what about black-on-black crime?\u201d\n\nEvery single day this place focuses on black excellence and highlights those who are engaged in eliminating white supremacy. We have criticized both black and white alike. If you don\u2019t see it, it\u2019s because you have chosen to remain willfully ignorant.\n\nOr maybe you\u2019re a goddamn liar.", "keywords": ["clapback", "sex", "roots", "dont", "talk", "mailbag", "writing", "root", "black", "white", "thanksgiving", "im", "say"], "polarity": 0.0361974573780129, "subjectivity": 0.4478799235743681},

The GOP has accused him of a conflict of interest in that case because his wife accepted nearly $500,000 in political donations from Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe in a state legislature bid that predated the investigation. The Washington Post reported, in December, McCabe\u2019s intention to retire when he became eligible for pension benefits in early March. Trump, who has been among McCabe\u2019s fiercest critics, characterized the move as \u201cracing the clock to retire with full benefits.\u201d A spokesperson for the FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump, as early as July, had called for McCabe\u2019s ouster, demanding, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t A.G. Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation?\u201d \u201cHow can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin\u2019 James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife\u2019s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?\u201d he tweeted in December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Washington Post reports that after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, he asked McCabe during a closed-door meeting whom he voted for during the 2016 election.\n\nThe Hill notes that because McCabe is a civil servant, it was almost impossible to fire him unless there was clear evidence that he\u2019d done something wrong.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why McCabe decided to retire just months from his retirement, or whether scrutiny over his tenure had intensified. According to CNN, there have been conflicting reports as to what actually took place:\n\nVarious sources described McCabe\u2019s departure as a mutual decision, while others said it was the result of pressure to step down. One source briefed on the matter said McCabe announced his decision to senior executives and portrayed it as his choice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne source told the news network that McCabe\u2019s sudden announcement was not in the plans as of Friday. \u201cHe had enough of being undermined and criticized,\u201d another source said. But Trump and the administration were \u201cnot happy\u201d with him, the same source said, CNN reports.\n\nTrump did not respond when questioned about McCabe\u2019s \u201cstepping aside\u201d\u2014which appears to be the company line.\n\n\n\nClearly, this was never going to work.

Racism is not a one way street-and your angry and hatefully-toned blog posts and replies to comments just go to show that. Racism is not an American problem, it\u2019s a human problem and honestly, minorities in America have it pretty damn good. I\u2019m not saying things are perfect, but please go to any country in the world and by comparison you will see how much more tolerant and accepting people are in the US-byfar. Just like you have nothing to be ashamed of for being black, I don\u2019t have any self-loathing tendencies for being white. It\u2019s just a shame that black people can be openly racist and think it\u2019s only an one-way street, because it\u2019s obvously not.

One of the things I\u2019m most confused by is the vast quantity of white people who come to a site about race, read the content and reply, \u201cWhy do you have to make everything about race?\u201d\n\nThat is literally what Monique is paid to do, Pat. Your complaint is akin to someone asking why ESPN doesn\u2019t focus on politics more often. Why does everything have to be about sports over there?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not a technical wizard by any stretch of the imagination, but let me let you in on a bit of advanced computer coding that is hidden in whatever platform you are using to read this: If you look at the top of your screen, there is a small symbol of an arrow pointing left. That is called the \u201cback button.\u201d If you click on it, miraculously you won\u2019t be forced to read Monique\u2019s words. Also, If Monique\u2019s words make you uncomfortable, then good. It\u2019s the job of everyone here to make white people uncomfortable. All white people. Uncomfortable enough to do something. Anything.\n\nSome will not feel uncomfortable at all. They will think to themselves, \u201cI\u2019m not racist, I don\u2019t participate in racism, so I\u2019m not offended by any of this because they\u2019re not talking about me.\u201d\n\nSome of them, in their discomfort, will say, \u201cFuck The Root.\u201d\n\nSome of them will say, \u201cFuck this system; I need to do something about it.\u201d\n\nAnd some, unfortunately, will feel so uncomfortable about their own subconscious racism that in hopes of absolution, they will take the time to direct-message a writer about how black people complain too much about racism as they, themselves, are whining about a motherfucking Disney movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis week, news fellow Anne Branigin wrote this story:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the article appeared, Anne received a boatload of communications. The following letter is representative of them all.\n\nFrom: ABQ\n\nTo: Anne Branigin Why dont you go in as hard on punk hillary the aristocratic bitch that used bubba to imprison millions of poor mostly black men. Or her advocacy of private prisons. And to later imply who blacks should vote for. How about shutting the fuck up bitch. What could your snow white ass come in and tell us collectively whats for our good. Im a bernie or bust voter that voted for trump cause i hated hillary and wanted an end to globalization. 8 years obama had an opportunity to adress criminal justice reform. 8 YEARS!!!!! bottom line before you go out and denounce the only person with guts to advocate for the belitttled and downtrodden do a little inbiased research your self. As a real black person, not some bitch with a platform to talk, i think that hes a ok with me. How about asking a black person before writimg about what we need pr who we feel is that person to advocate for it. It sure wasnt cunt ass hillary\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear ABQ,\n\nFirst of all ... I asked Monique, and she told me that Anne isn\u2019t pasty white or \u201csnow white.\u201d Anne confirmed that while she has seen seven dwarfs, she has never lived with seven of them. Or a prince.\n\nBut I thank you for your letter. I want to explain how this anti-Bernie bias works.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery morning, the writers at The Root compile a list of stories we will write about. Some of them are assigned to us. Some of them are newsworthy events. Some of them are our own ideas. Then we spend the rest of the day reporting, writing about or covering an issue.\n\nNone of us here at The Root are sitting around waiting for a story about Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton to surface so that we can bash either candidate. While we care about politics and how they affect minorities, when it comes to Bernie vs. Hillary, or Chrisette Michelle or most other divisive issues, we try to adhere to a strict journalistic policy known as \u201cnot giving a fuck.\u201d\n\nAnne isn\u2019t sitting around the office rocking back and forth like she\u2019s in a double Dutch competition waiting for a story so she can bash Bernie. She wrote about a quote that Bernie actually said. If you have an issue with what he said or how it was received, you should write an angry email to Bernie Sanders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou should also be aware of one other thing about Bernie Sanders (whom\u2014in the spirit of full disclosure\u2014I confess I voted for in the primaries):\n\nHe motherfucking lost.\n\nI wanted him to win. A lot of black and brown people wanted him to win. But he got his ass whipped. Very few people think that Hillary Clinton is a friend to black people or even unworthy of being called a \u201ccunt ass.\u201d (Although I do question your blackness for using that word. It\u2019s just not a thing for us.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen we write a story that reflects how actual people feel, it\u2019s not meant to be an attack. It just is. Some black and brown people just weren\u2019t down with Bernie like that. Deal with it.\n\nOr not.\n\nWe don\u2019t give a fuck.\n\nFrom: Greg T.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: You\u2019re obsession with white people Why are you so racist against white people. I think you are a good writer, but you take every opportunity to down white people. Your anti-white jokes aren\u2019t even funny anymore. Some white people don\u2019t care about race. It is people like you who are so obsessed with everything white people do or say who keep racism alive. Just like some white people need to get to know black people, you need to get to know some non-racist whites. Most white people are good people who want the same thing in life like everybody black. Sure there are some racists, but they are a small minority of white people. You need to stop focusing on them and find some non-racist white friends. Or maybe you can\u2019t because your the one whose the racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGreg,\n\nFirst of all ... what anti-white jokes? I was being serious. Every single time.\n\nI\u2019m glad you sent this. I have often been accused of being a racist. So often, in fact, that I decided to be proactive about it. The following is a letter that I hand out to anyone who accuses me of racism:\n\nDear Sir or Madam;\n\nThis letter certifies that the holder, Michael Harriot, can\u2019t be racist. We have verified that he, indeed, has at least one white friend, which exempts him from all claims of reverse racism, regular racism, anti-whiteness or hatred of Caucasians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe undersigned signatories hereby vouch for Mr. Harriot that they are his white friends, and he has never complained about their dance skills, demeaned their potato salad or asked them why they kiss their dogs in the mouth.\n\nSigned,\n\nB.

I know this sounds like some Inception-level shit where we make references to a mailbag inside a mailbag about the mailbag, so I will include some new stuff, too.\n\nLast week was a rough week for mail. I feel like you guys weren\u2019t bringing your racist A-game (the \u201ca\u201d stands for asswipe). I had to look for stuff to clap back at. I know it was the day after The Root 100 gala, and I may have awakened in my bed the next morning wearing a tuxedo jacket, formal shoes and no pants. I cannot confirm this, and also ... why are you being so nosy?\n\nLuckily, you guys really stepped up to the hate plate this week. I have received no less than 12 correspondences that contain the word \u201cnigger\u201d in them. While it does show a lack of creativity on the part of racists (400 years and \u201cnigger\u201d is the best you can do?*), it does set a new personal record for me.\n\nBravo, motherfuckers. Bravo.\n\nLet\u2019s read some mail:\n\n\n\n*I prefer the pure simplicity of \u201cporch monkey.\u201d\n\nThe following is a comment on Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan\u2019s article about a hair game, which some (white) people found very offensive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Mike Your just another niggger jealous of white people and pissed because you were born black, I would be to, you blacks snivel about everything and blame everyone else for your woes, but it is you who are to blame for the way people of all races see blacks and the way we see you is justified by the way people of all races see blacks and the way we see you is justified by the way blaks as a whole are, basically lie animals, all races really hate blacks, even blacks hate blacks and kill each other by the hunddreds every day, you wil alwasy be the scum of the earth and rightly so\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMike,\n\nIt is part of human nature to believe that everyone likes the same things and feels the same way you do. If you like a dish, how could anyone else not like it? If a joke makes you laugh, how could anyone else not think it\u2019s funny? The entire staff of The Root still can\u2019t wrap their minds around the idea that, after having tasted bacon, I think it is just \u201ca\u2019ight.\u201d They can\u2019t even process the concept. They have actually come to the conclusion that every time I\u2019ve tried it, it must have been fake bacon. Like there\u2019s an international conspiracy to slip mediocre pork products to Michael Harriot. It\u2019s probably beef lobbyists. Big beef must be behind it* (which, I must add, would be my stripper name). I said all of that to make this point, Mike:\n\nJust because you hate black people doesn\u2019t mean everyone hates black people.\n\nI know the concept is as mind-numbingly implausible as someone\u2019s being apathetic about eating pig thigh meat. I truly understand that so much hate is buried in the rancid, charcoal black muscle you call a heart that you think everyone in the world must obviously have the same despicable disposition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMike, you\u2019re not going to believe me when I say this, but trust me it\u2019s true: Not all white people are racist.\n\nNope. Trust me, it\u2019s true. In fact, I\u2019ll tell you another secret. There are even people in the world (I will admit, they\u2019re probably some kind of lexical geniuses or something) who use periods and all that fancy-schmancy punctuation shit. They even know the difference between \u201cyour\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re.\u201d\n\nNow, I\u2019m going to keep the grammar thing between you and me, because I intend to cite you as a source to every Caucasian crier who says, \u201cNot all white people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThanks, Mike.\n\nThanks,\n\nMike\n\n*That\u2019s what she said.\n\nFrom Twitter user BuildTheWall:\n\nThis comments related to article complaining to whites that bring up black on black crime. You said over 91% of blacks are killed by other blacks & most whites are murdered by other whites & failed to mention that 84% of whites are killed by other whites , blacks commit approximately 50% homicides in the U.S. every year & commit most crime at a much higher ratio / percent of other races. They burn towns / cities & then cry about needing everyone to give them something for free , they take over 35% welfare annually are only 13% - 15% of this nations population & shift the blame saying most welfare goes to whites. They are taught that only white people can be racist in some schools / colleges & this only makes race relations worse. Pointing out facts doesn\u2019t feel good does it? I am no racist & to be honest the world sucks. There will be no end to the shitholes that many poor or unemployed blacks live at in all major cities & poor black areas in general until welfare is cut off for many of them because a large percentage of them don\u2019t need it & just refuse to work like any other race. When you cut off welfare for those that can work & are just sitting home they\u2019ll to get off their asses & find a job. You have no idea how much better life would be for many people if they lost their welfare. I have seen major improvements in attitudes after they started working no matter their skin color. They were scared as hell at first & when they got a job their attitude was much better then when they were relying on welfare because they were able to get an apartment , had money to spend & got out of the shithole they were living in. My girlfriend was one of those black people that relied on welfare because she didn\u2019t want to work. I told her that she was only allowed to eat dollar store soup until she got a job & kept my food which was mainly meat & poultry was in a chest freezer. She left my food alone & found a job in only 1 week . When she got a job she was given a key to the chest freezer & allowed to eat whatever she wanted as long as she mentioned it if I was gone so I could replace it. She was also stuck at home & not able to go out until she got a job. You want to know what she did over it? She was angry at me about it until she got a job & thanked me for making her stay at home because she realized that\u2019s a little like how she was living for years & she no longer feels imprisoned like she was on welfare. She said the job gave her more freedom then she could have imagined & finally has some money to spend because of me. I overheard this when she was talking to a friend because she talks a little loud & th\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is so much to unpack here, so I won\u2019t. Instead, I would like to submit that this isn\u2019t one of the most racist things I\u2019ve ever received, but it is all the racist things I\u2019ve received. If someone wanted to know what kind of hate mail black writers get, this would be my prototype.\n\nIt is excellent in its sheer lack of fucks given about grammar. The way he refers to his arbitrarily derived statistics as \u201cfacts\u201d is baconlike in both taste and saltiness. But you know what my favorite part is? The way, smack dab in the middle of this verbal diarrhea, he says, \u201cI\u2019m no racist.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one of my favorite parts.\n\nI was actually going to include this letter in last week\u2019s mailbag, but last Friday\u2019s bag of bullshit ran pretty long, so I had totally forgotten about the part where he said he had a black girlfriend whom he trained to work and be responsible through a system of starvation and ass-whippings. (I know the DM didn\u2019t say anything about ass whippings, but y\u2019all know. ... You think this guy doesn\u2019t slap women around?) I am also still trying to wrap my head around the fact that an actual woman, with a vagina and everything, let him stick his flaccid, chicken-neck-looking, underdeveloped, thumb-shaped penis inside her. I guess even a trash can catches a steak some days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich brings me to my last point about the worst people on the planet. I know I talk about racism very often, but there is a class of people who are worse than racists: the motherfuckers who put locks on refrigerators.\n\nIf Hitler\u2019s Third Reich had been limited to these motherfuckers, he would have been hailed as a hero. I\u2019ve always heard about these people, but even this brief, momentary contact makes me want to take one of those Silkwood showers where I scrub my skin really hard with a medium-bristle wire brush and then sit on the floor of the shower with my arms wrapped around my legs thinking about the complexities of the human condition and why they don\u2019t make Pop-Tarts without the icing anymore as my tears slowly dissolve down the drain.\n\nSee what I go through for y\u2019all?\n\nThe following are two comments left on last week\u2019s mailbag from a user named Dusty. Dusty was apparently triggered by me saying, \u201cWhite people are evil.\u201d\n\nI like to pop in from time to time to see how other folks view the world who aren\u2019t like me and I have not posted until now. You write that all white people are evil and then try to make a nuanced explanation, but in the end, had a white person said \u201call black people are evil\u201d regardless of the explanation, they would immediately be branded a racist. How do you justify pointing out all the anti-black racism when many comments and articles on this site are anti-white? How do you expect a white person to act when you put your thumb in their eye at every opportunity?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDusty later wrote:\n\nSo you think saying all white people are evil is appropriate? How about all black people are evil?\n\nDearest Dusty,\n\nSorry for putting my thumb in your eye. I\u2019m also sorry that your anus is still so sore from me saying, \u201cWhite people are evil\u201d that you missed the entire point of last week\u2019s mailbag.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd you\u2019re right, by the way. If a white person had said, \u201cAll black people are evil,\u201d I would have assumed they were racist. I probably wouldn\u2019t have typed a letter or comment to the site where they said it, though. I wouldn\u2019t have done it for one particular reason:\n\nIf I were browsing that imaginary site that said, \u201cBlack people are evil,\u201d I bet it would have a million stories on it. I would imagine that it had stories about crime, racism, inequality, injustice, death, satire, politics, pop culture and even achievements. After I perused through all of the other worldviews that are different from mine, the thing I would have been offended by the least (or at least not enough to toggle me into \u201cletter-writing mode\u201d) was someone saying, \u201cBlack people are evil.\u201d Would you like to know why?\n\nBecause I am not evil.\n\nI know it\u2019s hard dealing with the racism against white people. I\u2019ve felt it, too. Last year, while filling out my taxes, I told my son to get his registration so I could see how much I paid to register his car. I walked to the garage with him, and when he fumbled around in the glove compartment searching for the right paper, I yelled at him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wasn\u2019t being mean, but in that moment, all I could think about was, \u201cWhat if the wrong cop was standing over this black kid fumbling around in his glove compartment?\u201d That stupid little moment of teenage carelessness could cost my son his life\u2014because he is black.\n\nIt is a tough thing to wrestle with, watching your children, knowing the more they grow, the more they become prey. It is scary to think about that every time they leave the house. And then I thought, I bet this is just how Dusty feels when he reads words on the internet.\n\nSee? Our battles with racism are the same, Dusty.\n\nBut there is something else in your comments that I\u2019d like to point out:\n\nI said, \u201cWhite people are evil.\u201d\n\nYou asked, \u201cSo you think saying all white people are evil is appropriate?\u201d\n\nYou also wrote, \u201cYou write that all white people are evil and then try to make a nuanced explanation ... \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you notice the difference in those sentences, Dusty?\n\nYou added an \u201call.\u201d I didn\u2019t say \u201call,\u201d Dusty. Thank you for clearing this up for me. Now I understand everything. For so long I\u2019ve been accusing the \u201cnot all white people\u201d crowd of being too sensitive and privileged, but now I understand.\n\nWhite people can\u2019t read!\n\nNow that you\u2019ve pointed it out to me, it\u2019s clear, Dusty! Thank you for that.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying that \u201call\u201d white people are illiterate. Just some. The ones who compare comments on the internet to 400 years of rape, torture, injustice, murder and inequality. The ones so dumb they actually think they can convince people that they are open-minded and sophisticated enough to cruise the internet to hear opinions different from their own, but so sensitive they can\u2019t handle opinions different from their own. The ones so privileged they think they can actually tell people that their opinions aren\u2019t \u201cappropriate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot all white people, Dusty.\n\nJust you.\n\nHey, Mike said it, not me.", "keywords": ["clapback", "evil", "roots", "mailbags", "blacks", "think", "saying", "mailbag", "know", "welfare", "black", "white", "job", "way"], "polarity": -0.06077503969763386, "subjectivity": 0.48780286426729924},

Since that time, Trump has openly antagonized, insulted and bullied Sessions, both in conversation and on social media.\n\nSources have told the Washington Post that special counsel Robert Mueller has taken a keen interest in Trump\u2019s belittling of Sessions. Specifically, Mueller wants to know if Trump has been attempting to drive Sessions from his job and whether that is part of a pattern of attempted obstruction of justice.\n\nMueller\u2019s team has reportedly questioned witnesses in recent months about Trump\u2019s comments and state of mind when he wrote negative tweets about Sessions in July and August of last year.\n\nWas Trump trying to push Sessions out so he could appoint someone else who could control the Russia investigation?

They filibustered, claimed they didn\u2019t like the public forum and noted that they felt that answering certain questions was inappropriate.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe noted that they had never been asked to intervene in an ongoing investigation. Both National Security Agency Director Adm.

King wanted to know why they weren\u2019t answering questions as to whether they had had conversations with the president, or whether or not they had conversations with now former FBI Director James Comey about Trump.\n\n\u201cIs there some prohibition in the law that I\u2019m not familiar with that you can\u2019t discuss an item that you\u2019ve been asked directly?\u201d King asked McCabe, Mediate reports.\n\nMcCabe replied that it wasn\u2019t appropriate for him to answer the question. King stayed on him until it was clear that he wasn\u2019t going to answer anything, and then King turned his attention to Roger and Coats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKing wanted to know why Rogers wasn\u2019t answering, since he hadn\u2019t exercised executive privilege and the questions being asked weren\u2019t classified.\n\nRogers said, \u201cI feel it is inappropriate.\u201d\n\n\n\nKing shot back: \u201cWhat you feel isn\u2019t relevant, Admiral.

Way to demonize white people when your own shit race is responsible for the most crime in the country despite being only somewhere between 12-15% of the population. Go educate yourself so you can have some context the next time you feel like you want to speak about something you are so clearly ignorant in.\u2019\n\nDear Mr. YouAreStupid:\n\nFirst, I and my \u201cshit race\u201d would like to thank you for going on Twitter, creating an account and naming it \u201cMichael YouAreStupid.\u201d I wish I had that much time on my hands, but bravo to you. You are obviously good at whatever you do ... and racism. You are very good at racism.\n\nSecond, I\u2019m glad you brought to my attention how much less advanced my \u201cshit race\u201d is than every other race. Your intense research of stupid internet memes instantly trumps the nondebatable historical facts that every advancement in ancient European society was stolen from Africa.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you have an \u201calt-right\u201d meme about how the things you hold dear for having been created by \u201cWestern civilization\u201d and white men were remnants of knowledge we donated to the savage palefaces who traveled to Egypt to learn science, astronomy and architecture? Is there a Twitter pic that shows how Socrates, Plato and Aristotle were really just hacks regurgitating remnants of philosophy they learned in Africa?\n\nDoes your meme research include any captions that talk about how the now decrepit Greek and Roman buildings were constructed centuries after the pyramids? Is there one that explains how Europeans thought the Earth was flat and the sun revolved around the Earth and didn\u2019t know how to navigate with compasses or by the stars until someone from the \u201cdark continent\u201d told them: \u201cHold up, you silly white man. Let me show you something\u201d?\n\nOr maybe you might be able to find a photo that represents the idea that Africans are living in huts because thirsty, greedy white men arrived on the shores of Africa ready to rape, pillage and plunder everything on the continent because ... well ... that\u2019s just what white people do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr, just to see what it would look like, maybe you could show a collage comparison of the Native Americans, Africans, Aborigines, Aztecs, Mayans, Taino and Inuit to illustrate what happens when white people show up.\n\nNah, that\u2019s just too many \u201cshit race\u201d boxes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrianboz, there are a lot of black people who immediately dismiss the idea of reverse racism. I do not. I believe that it exists because I once met a white guy who explained to me how he grew up poor in an all-black neighborhood and was constantly picked on. I stand against all racism, even the reverse kind. It is demeaning, and no one should have to endure it.\n\nI think affirmative action is definitely a form of reverse racism. I also think that reverse racism is actually worse than regular, American-made, throwback racism, because no one acknowledges it, and it is harder to deal with.\n\nB-Boz, I understand that being white is like being a piece of delicate crystal\u2014you are easily broken. Someone so fragile shouldn\u2019t have to experience the horror of bigotry. I mean, black people have the luxury of having had their skin and psyches weathered and hardened by centuries of dealing with prejudice. It hurts so much more when you must deal with it once or twice in a lifetime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome people would say that crying about reverse racism is like whining about how much it hurts when lightning strikes, but not me, Boz. I feel your pain. I understand how affirmative action probably gave the two minority Fortune 500 CEOs their jobs, but the other 498 \u201cworked their way to the top.\u201d I believe you are right to direct accusations of reverse racism toward college admissions boards who want diverse institutions. I can\u2019t imagine how bad you feel when you are excluded from a job because a company wants to hire more minorities.\n\nBut I have a question for you, Brian B: Do you feel the same pain in your panties-bunched anal region when you conveniently ignore the biased testing, unequal education system, and history of segregation and exclusion that created the need for those programs? Are your white tears as salty when you think about how the black unemployment rate has been double that of whites for more than 50 years? When you hear how r\u00e9sum\u00e9s with black names are tossed in the trash, or how black people are paid less than white people regardless of education or experience, do you have the same level of butt-hurtedness?\n\nOne more question, Brian: Would you like to hear how I know the concept of \u201creverse racism\u201d is a bullshit product of white fragility, white tears and idiotic, unaware cognitive dissonance?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause\u2014unlike the original-recipe racism that black people deal with every day\u2014\u201creverse racism\u201d happens so infrequently to white people that when it does, they actually remember it.\n\nThe following tweets are in response to the new Nas-and-Jay-Z-like beef between me and Megan McArdle in this article:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSabrina, don\u2019t listen to Doug. He is wrong. I do actually respect you. Contrary to popular belief, I don\u2019t hate white people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sure Doug thinks I do. There are many people who assume that I dislike white people as a whole, and I want to assure you that I do not. This next analogy is going to sound fucked up at first, but I pray you\u2019ll understand.\n\nI treat white people like my sister treats dogs.\n\nWhen my sisters and I were growing up, there were homes with mean dogs scattered throughout my neighborhood. One day, one of them got loose and bit my sister on the leg. She has been afraid of dogs ever since.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy sister is smart. She knows that not every dog bites. She understands that most dogs won\u2019t bite her. But there is no way to distinguish the ones who will bite from the ones who won\u2019t, so she just stays away from dogs. She doesn\u2019t trust them.\n\nHere\u2019s the funny thing: My sister has a rescue dog named Lola that she absolutely loves. Actually, she loves Lola more than people should love animals. She takes her dog to dog church and treats it like a human. She knows Lola won\u2019t bite her because she knows Lola.\n\nSabrina, when I write about \u201cwhite people,\u201d I\u2019m writing about the mean ones. I\u2019m writing about the racist ones. I\u2019m not talking about all white people when I talk about race. I know that there are some white people who don\u2019t hold malice and racism in their hearts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut imagine how you would feel if you were attacked by dogs every day for 400 years. If you have been bitten by them at civil rights marches. If you have seen them chase you off their lawns. Imagine centuries of watching them maul people who look like you. Imagine knowing that they are trained by society to attack you. Wouldn\u2019t that make you leery of dogs?\n\nBut Doug would have you believe that I hate them. I do not. I don\u2019t even think that all, or even most, will bite. I just try to deconstruct the reasons dogs are like this. I want the training to stop so that I don\u2019t get nervous every time a dog sees me. I don\u2019t hate dogs.\n\nBut I know they all have teeth.", "keywords": ["clapback", "reverse", "questions", "unanswered", "roots", "racism", "dogs", "dont", "mailbag", "know", "race", "black", "white", "im", "feel"], "polarity": 0.019458046194687433, "subjectivity": 0.41400055203490305},

This shit is real.\n\nIn fact, this week, instead of hate mail, let\u2019s just look at some actual comments from the site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is an actual comment \u201cMadril\u201d left on a story about a caf\u00e9 that refused to give candy to black kids on Halloween:\n\nSome of you will take this the wrong way because AA or Black Americans have been conditioned to be the victim in America. It is understandable that the psychological damage due to slavery, Jim Crow and Segregation still pervades the mind of many African Americans. Moreover, the Black Elites who are taking their cues from the White Liberal Elite and Democratic Leadership are also continuing to push the premise of Black Victimization and White Supremacy. The reality is that the cafe has the right not to give Black kids candy. It is their cafe. The same way you have the right to open a cage next door that will compete against this \u201cracist cafe.\u201d Or the right not to shop at that cafe. The only way to gain your respect is to build your own and stop complaining about racism. The fact is there are no government institutions in the USA in 2017 that will block African American or Black Americans from starting a competing cafe or any other business for that matter. Yes there are individual people who are racists, but that will never change.What needs to change is the victim attitude and playing the race card. The race card is lame and no one is listening or cares cause our community is not respected. America is the greatest country for economic opportunity and mobility. Plan and work harder and smarter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMadril,\n\nI don\u2019t know how to tell you this in a tactful way, so I will just go ahead and say it because you aren\u2019t aware of the truth behind this statement:\n\nWhite people are evil.\n\nAfter reading your bullshit reasoned explanation, I was hesitant about making such a broad generalization. I even deleted and rewrote the sentence a few times. Then I realized that someone had to tell Madril. Maybe it should be me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore you get upset about me painting white people with such a broad brush, I want you to know that I don\u2019t think all white people are evil. According to my rough calculations, the percentage of evil white people is about the same as the ratio of poisonous snakes or venomous spiders to their respective populations overall. Now, I could take a course in herpetology and learn how to differentiate the killer snakes from the harmless ones, but just to be safe, I don\u2019t fuck with snakes.\n\nI know you don\u2019t want to think your people are evil, Madril. Neither do I. At first I tried to convince myself that maybe it was just Madril. Maybe Satan ejaculated into a shitbag of a human being who just happened to be ovulating, and 13 months later, out popped Madril (I think there is a longer gestation period for tiny pieces of toilet asswipe clotted with dried remnants of day-old diarrhea manifested in human form. I\u2019m pretty sure I read that in a medical journal), but then I thought, \u201cNah ... it\u2019s white people.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not your fault, Madril. You were enabled by your evil peers. I doubt that you are even aware of your evilness. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure of it. I\u2019m not shocked that you actually sat down and wrote a letter that used free-market economics to rationalize literally taking candy from babies\u2014any evil individual could do that. But you sent it to someone, Madril! The fact that you released it into the wild for all the world to see is proof that your people have normalized it until you are unaware of how vile you are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though you are a trash human being, don\u2019t despair. There is always room in this world for demons like you. I mean, it was your people who came up with the idea to combine two of the most despicable activities and ruin the world by simultaneously raping and pillaging. You used white-people-ing economics to justify colonization, genocide and the trans-Atlantic slave trade, so why not use it to explain how you fucked over babies who just wanted to trick-or-treat?\n\nSo go out there and keep shitting on toddlers, Madril. Keep on tricking. Keep on injecting poison into the world.\n\nMake your people proud.\n\nThis comment from \u201cSweetJamesJones\u201d is from The Root staffer Danielle Young\u2019s (I don\u2019t know her title, but I think it\u2019s either \u201cdope person\u201d or \u201cexecutive in charge of making fun of that one time Michael Harriot had on too much lip balm\u201d) brave article this week about her experience with famous men:\n\nAs a guy, I just want to say that this is tough. I want to be clear that the guys who did this stuff was wrong, but men are left in a Catch-22. I\u2019m sure I will be eviscerated, but here goes the reasoning. First, a lot of women love that type of attention. They feel it is complimentary, and it makes them feel wanted. Maybe all women are uncomfortable and not saying anything, but that\u2019s highly unlikely. Secondly, men have to pursue women, but there are no guidelines to doing so. All women have a different tolerance for flirting and contact. If a guy never makes an advance, he never gets a woman. If he comes in weak and respectful, some women will hate that. If he comes on strong, some women will see it as harrassment. As a guy, I\u2019m perplexed as to what to do as some women would feel uncomfortable if you simply ask them on a date. Instead of simply calling out these guys, can people actually come up with clear direction on how guys should act. Finally, Weinstein and others were clearly wrong. I am not defending that, but this seems like they simply found you attractive and wanted a chance. Its in a grey area.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSweetJamesJones,\n\nYou know how I just eviscerated Madril a few seconds ago? Well, after careful consideration, in light of the revelations about Jesse Jackson, John Singleton, Harvey Weinstein, Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore and, now, Louis C.K., I think I need to say this:\n\nMen are trash.\n\nI know women say that shit all the time as if it were a joke, but they have no idea the percentage of men who are shit bags who should be tossed on the trash heap of humanity. We ain\u2019t shit. None of us. Myself included.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYep, I ain\u2019t shit, either, SweetJamesJones. If I wasn\u2019t a piece of human garbage, my knuckles would be bleeding from punching motherfuckers like you in their fuckboy mouths. When I read about people like Bill Cosby, R. Kelly or Harvey Weinstein, I\u2019m not even shocked, because every man knows multiple other nonfamous men who do the same thing (minus the asking women if they can masturbate in front of them. That\u2019s strictly a white-boy thing). But we don\u2019t say shit because we aren\u2019t shit.\n\nSo you\u2019re saying men don\u2019t know where to draw the line for sexual harassment because some women like it? What kind of idiotic statement is that? There is a small minority of people who like everything, SweetShitJones. I know a woman who likes ketchup on her eggs, but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t an atrocity. I once saw heard about a documentary on this streaming site called Pornhub about a man who became sexually excited from women defecating on him. He liked it. So would it be OK if a woman shit in your mouth without asking you, SweetJamesJones?\n\nJames, you say there are no guidelines to pursuing women. But there are. I\u2019ll tell you where the line is:\n\nStop. Being. White. People.\n\nSexism is just like racism, James. Only white people and toxic motherfuckers like you think in those selfish terms of not giving a damn about how anyone feels as long as you can ejaculate at the end of the encounter. You can\u2019t rape and enslave whole human beings because you want to have an orgasm or own a plantation, James. That\u2019s evil, man. There is just no other way to say it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know what the fucked-up thing is, James?\n\nI believe you don\u2019t know where the line is. I believe you were being sincere. I believe Madril was being sincere. Madril doesn\u2019t feel like he hates black people, and you don\u2019t believe you hate women. At least Madril is just taking literal candy.\n\nBut just as Madril believes racism is a byproduct of normal society, you believe sexual harassment is a byproduct of your inherent male right to stick your dick into a moist hole\u2014all other humans be damned. The line is you, James. You are already across it because you think there is actually a line where you can almost sexually harass someone, but not quite!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoddamn, man, what the fuck is wrong with you?\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with us?\n\nWe ain\u2019t shit.\n\nDamn, damn, damn, James.\n\nI\u2019m out.", "keywords": ["clapback", "roots", "think", "dont", "mailbag", "area", "know", "gray", "women", "black", "white", "im", "say", "shit", "madril"], "polarity": -0.02480267748124891, "subjectivity": 0.490844671201814},

A suit that looked like it was made specially for him. A matching pocket square and tie. Nice shoes. An air of confidence that was noticeable but not put on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI had to come over here because I spotted you and that lipstick from all the way across the room,\u201d he said, smiling. His teeth were perfect.\n\nI smiled but said nothing.\n\nHe leaned a little closer, his voice lower this time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be funny, but you looking like a whole snack. Can I eat you?\u201d he asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI laughed and said \u201cSir\u201d loudly.\n\nMy girl laughed. He turned, unshaken, to look at her. He flashed a grin at her, then turned back toward me and looked expectantly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the most expensive dish on the menu, sir,\u201d I said. My girl laughed again. This time, I joined her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithout missing a beat, he said, \u201cIt ain\u2019t tricking if you got it.\u201d\n\nThe next giggle caught in my throat.\n\nListen. If you are quick on your feet with the witty comebacks, you are well on your way to winning with me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe had my attention.\n\nWe bantered back and forth for a few minutes. I signaled the bartender for my check as he flirted with me.\n\nHe was smooth, and the lines he came with after that first one were clever and flattering. He never took his eyes off me, even when his friend walked up and stood just off to the side of us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the bartender put my check down, he immediately snatched it up.\n\n\u201cI got it,\u201d he said. He took out an American Express card and slipped it inside without even looking at the bill.\n\nMe and my girl looked at each other and smirked.\n\nIt was a player move. He wanted us to know that the amount of the bill was of no consequence to him; he carries no balances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe see you, sir, I thought to myself.\n\n\u201cWe can pay for our own check,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cNo, please,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me.\u201d\n\nMore banter. As we talked, I had my phone in my hand because I was live-tweeting everything that was happening. In that moment, everything is funny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAre you texting your boyfriend?\u201d he asked.\n\nI laughed and looked back at my girl again, who was giving me the look. She slowly rolled her eyes to the left, and I took in his homeboy for the first time.\n\nHe. Was. Not. Cute.\n\nMy girl could tell I was warming up to my guy, and she gave me the look, like, Bitch, you better not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Man had signed the bill and was already asking me what we were planning to do next.\n\nI made up some vague story about us having another spot to hit, and he continued smooth-talking me and my girl until we were convinced to go along with them to another bar, where we were joined by his brother.\n\nIn an effort to both give me and my girl a moment to ourselves and not look like a creep, he arranged for us to ride in two separate Lyfts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy girl was only slightly annoyed, but she warned me that if his brother wasn\u2019t cute, we were leaving the next bar as soon as we walked in.\n\nHis brother was very cute.\n\nWe hung out with the three of them until very late, drinking, laughing, listening to music and having a good time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr. Man and his brother invited us back to their hotel suite. It\u2019s clich\u00e9 and probably a little dangerous, but we went anyway because it was summertime in New York City; we were buzzed off of alcohol, laughter and good vibes; and the mood was right.\n\nWe started out sitting in the living area as a group, but slowly broke off into pairs.\n\nWe lay side by side on his bed talking about everything from my career as a writer to his lifestyle as a lawyer in Miami.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe massaged my scalp, gave me a back rub and played with my feet.\n\nI licked his lips, got high off of his scent and fell asleep with my face smushed into his chest.\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t drool once, thankfully.\n\nThe next day, as we parted ways, we exchanged phone numbers.\n\nHe saved me as \u201cTo Be Continued\u201d in his phone.\n\nI saved him as \u201cHe Did That\u201d in mine\u2014because he did, in fact, do that.\n\nBut it would take an entirely new column just to explain how ...\n\n(To be continued next Friday)", "keywords": ["incidents", "took", "laughed", "looking", "looked", "turned", "serial", "look", "wasnt", "girl", "life", "nonmonogamist", "sir", "way"], "polarity": 0.15045436045436042, "subjectivity": 0.4349194324194323},

You\u2019d think at this point that the president would understand that while he gets to appoint the attorney general, the appointee is not his personal lawyer and therefore can do whatever he or she wants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop Donald Trump from blasting Jeff \u201cKing Keebler\u201d Sessions\u2019 decision-making because he loves undermining his own appointee.\n\nThe funniest part of all this is that Trump slapped King Keebler down, when clearly this investigation was an attempt to appease the president. The president was reacting to news on Tuesday that Big Keebler, the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general, will investigate allegations that the FBI and DOJ bypassed the law in efforts to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants. That somehow the Obama administration didn\u2019t go through FISA when bugging folks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s how The Hill explains this fuss fight over more rumored shit that most likely didn\u2019t happen:\n\nTrump has publicly pressed Sessions to open up an investigation into potential abuses of the program, which allows U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies to obtain secret surveillance orders on individuals in the U.S. suspected of being foreign terrorists or spies. The president claimed last year that the Obama administration improperly wiretapped members of his presidential campaign and transition team, though the White House has not provided any evidence to support that claim. Allegations of FISA abuses surfaced again last month, when Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee released a controversial memo alleging that FBI and Justice Department officials misused their authority to obtain a surveillance order on Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo King Keebler Klaus\u2014or KKK, for short\u2014finally said, \u201cFine. \u2018I\u2019ll fake-look into it.\u201d Basically, he was throwing the president a bone, and even that pissed off the president because nothing is good enough for this man.

In November, as the Post previously reported, she and her 7-year-old child presented themselves to border agents in San Diego, where they passed a screening interview with an asylum officer.\n\nHowever, days later, the daughter was forcibly taken from her mother and the two were placed in separate detention centers thousands of miles apart. The mother was detained in a center in San Diego; the daughter was shipped to a Chicago detention center, where she has been kept for the past four months.\n\nNow the mother has been released, but she has yet to receive word on the status of her daughter, with whom she\u2019s only had a few phone conversations since they were torn apart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stark details of the case\u2014immigration authorities have never provided any real justification for separating the mother and child\u2014prompted the American Civil Liberties Union to file a lawsuit against the U.S. government, charging that it violated the family\u2019s constitutional rights. The suit also calls for the two to be reunited immediately.\n\nSeparating a family seeking refuge is the sort of bureaucratic cruelty that\u2019s been the calling card of Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policy (while Barack Obama\u2019s track record on deportations is nothing to exalt, it was policy under his administration for women and children to be held together at detention centers). But as the Post\u2019s op-ed pointed out, what makes this case and others like it particularly heinous is that immigration officials can\u2019t get their stories straight about why they would separate parents from their child.\n\n\u201cA year ago, then-Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly said publicly that his department might separate children from parents caught crossing the border, including those fleeing violence and seeking asylum, as a punitive means of deterring others who might follow,\u201d the Post\u2019s editorial board wrote, adding that Kelly\u2019s successor, Kirstjen Nielsen, floated a similar idea again in December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut DHS officials now claim that they would only separate minors from their parents for the child\u2019s protection. In the case of the Congolese mother and the ACLU lawsuit, one DHS official told the Post in a statement that the department doesn\u2019t \u201ccurrently have a policy of separating women and children,\u201d but noted that the department may do so, \u201cparticularly to protect a child from potential smuggling and trafficking activities.\u201d\n\nOf course, that clearly isn\u2019t the case for the Congolese mother and her daughter\u2014otherwise, why would the former have been released? For now, the administration is maintaining its silence on the matter, and the two still have no idea why they were separated, and whether they will be reunited.\n\n\u201cEach time S.S.\u201d\u2014the 7-year-old daughter\u2014\u201cis able to speak with her mother on the phone, she is crying,\u201d reads the ACLU lawsuit. \u201cEvery day that S.S. is separated from her mother causes her greater emotional and psychological harm and could potentially lead to permanent emotional trauma.\u201d", "keywords": ["seeking", "parents", "policy", "explain", "mother", "refuge", "daughter", "report", "congolese", "apart", "torn", "border", "separate", "post", "lawsuit", "immigration", "case", "detention"], "polarity": 0.038505747126436785, "subjectivity": 0.4295977011494253},

Yes, we\u2019re making it a day of the week. The name \u201cFriday\u201d wasn\u2019t imaginative enough. Plus, it has nothing to do with frying. If they only served fried chicken and french fries, then I\u2019d be cool with the name, but I think the last day before the weekend should be reserved for clapping back.\n\nI\u2019m not just talking about how we here at The Root respond to the hateful tweets, emails or comments; I\u2019m talking about you, too. Why not use this day to clap back at everyone who fucked with you during the week? Send an anonymous note to Sheila in human resources telling her she needs to use better deodorant, if only for the one day you have team meetings. Scream \u201cFuck you\u201d to the mailman who left your packages from Amazon.com in the rain.\n\nLet this be a healing day because the end of the week should be a catharsis so that you can empty out your negative energy and absorb something positive. Because next week is going to be shitty, too. Because haters gonna hate and motherfuckers gonna motherfuck.\n\nBecause clapping back is self-care.\n\nThe following is a Twitter direct message received by staff writer Monique Judge from a reader named Patrick:\n\nSince you \u201csaid what you said\u201d I\u2019ll say what I say too: It\u2019s great and makes sense that Lion King has a predominately black cast. However you making it about race and calling people \u201cpasty faces\u201d how does that make things better? How is it not divisive? Racism is not a one way street-and your angry and hatefully-toned blog posts and replies to comments just go to show that. Racism is not an American problem, it\u2019s a human problem and honestly, minorities in America have it pretty damn good. I\u2019m not saying things are perfect, but please go to any country in the world and by comparison you will see how much more tolerant and accepting people are in the US-byfar. Just like you have nothing to be ashamed of for being black, I don\u2019t have any self-loathing tendencies for being white. It\u2019s just a shame that black people can be openly racist and think it\u2019s only an one-way street, because it\u2019s obvously not. And before you reply some angry and race-based argument about how bad being black is in America and how oppressed you are, please save it. If yo want to talk like an adult and not shout insults at people for being different than you, I\u2019m open to that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Patrick,\n\nFirst of all, Monique is racist.\n\nLet\u2019s get that out of the way. I have spoken to our HR department about her calling white people pasty faces. That\u2019s just wrong. If Monique is using Elmer\u2019s glue as a standard, I think her adjectives are offensive, too. I believe your faces have more of a biscuit-dough complexion. The good biscuits, though. Like Pillsbury or something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, I\u2019d like to thank you and all white people who have the hubris to use the \u201cIt could be worse\u201d argument. It\u2019s like telling a woman who\u2019s been beaten up and left for dead, \u201cWell, at least he didn\u2019t rape you.\u201d\n\nBut I really wanted to get to your main point, Patty. One of the things I\u2019m most confused by is the vast quantity of white people who come to a site about race, read the content and reply, \u201cWhy do you have to make everything about race?\u201d\n\nThat is literally what Monique is paid to do, Pat. Your complaint is akin to someone asking why ESPN doesn\u2019t focus on politics more often. Why does everything have to be about sports over there?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not a technical wizard by any stretch of the imagination, but let me let you in on a bit of advanced computer coding that is hidden in whatever platform you are using to read this: If you look at the top of your screen, there is a small symbol of an arrow pointing left. That is called the \u201cback button.\u201d If you click on it, miraculously you won\u2019t be forced to read Monique\u2019s words. Also, If Monique\u2019s words make you uncomfortable, then good. It\u2019s the job of everyone here to make white people uncomfortable. All white people. Uncomfortable enough to do something. Anything.\n\nSome will not feel uncomfortable at all. They will think to themselves, \u201cI\u2019m not racist, I don\u2019t participate in racism, so I\u2019m not offended by any of this because they\u2019re not talking about me.\u201d\n\nSome of them, in their discomfort, will say, \u201cFuck The Root.\u201d\n\nSome of them will say, \u201cFuck this system; I need to do something about it.\u201d\n\nAnd some, unfortunately, will feel so uncomfortable about their own subconscious racism that in hopes of absolution, they will take the time to direct-message a writer about how black people complain too much about racism as they, themselves, are whining about a motherfucking Disney movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis week, news fellow Anne Branigin wrote this story:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the article appeared, Anne received a boatload of communications. The following letter is representative of them all.\n\nFrom: ABQ\n\nTo: Anne Branigin Why dont you go in as hard on punk hillary the aristocratic bitch that used bubba to imprison millions of poor mostly black men. Or her advocacy of private prisons. And to later imply who blacks should vote for. How about shutting the fuck up bitch. What could your snow white ass come in and tell us collectively whats for our good. Im a bernie or bust voter that voted for trump cause i hated hillary and wanted an end to globalization. 8 years obama had an opportunity to adress criminal justice reform. 8 YEARS!!!!! bottom line before you go out and denounce the only person with guts to advocate for the belitttled and downtrodden do a little inbiased research your self. As a real black person, not some bitch with a platform to talk, i think that hes a ok with me. How about asking a black person before writimg about what we need pr who we feel is that person to advocate for it. It sure wasnt cunt ass hillary\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear ABQ,\n\nFirst of all ... I asked Monique, and she told me that Anne isn\u2019t pasty white or \u201csnow white.\u201d Anne confirmed that while she has seen seven dwarfs, she has never lived with seven of them. Or a prince.\n\nBut I thank you for your letter. I want to explain how this anti-Bernie bias works.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery morning, the writers at The Root compile a list of stories we will write about. Some of them are assigned to us. Some of them are newsworthy events. Some of them are our own ideas. Then we spend the rest of the day reporting, writing about or covering an issue.\n\nNone of us here at The Root are sitting around waiting for a story about Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton to surface so that we can bash either candidate. While we care about politics and how they affect minorities, when it comes to Bernie vs. Hillary, or Chrisette Michelle or most other divisive issues, we try to adhere to a strict journalistic policy known as \u201cnot giving a fuck.\u201d\n\nAnne isn\u2019t sitting around the office rocking back and forth like she\u2019s in a double Dutch competition waiting for a story so she can bash Bernie. She wrote about a quote that Bernie actually said. If you have an issue with what he said or how it was received, you should write an angry email to Bernie Sanders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou should also be aware of one other thing about Bernie Sanders (whom\u2014in the spirit of full disclosure\u2014I confess I voted for in the primaries):\n\nHe motherfucking lost.\n\nI wanted him to win. A lot of black and brown people wanted him to win. But he got his ass whipped. Very few people think that Hillary Clinton is a friend to black people or even unworthy of being called a \u201ccunt ass.\u201d (Although I do question your blackness for using that word. It\u2019s just not a thing for us.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen we write a story that reflects how actual people feel, it\u2019s not meant to be an attack. It just is. Some black and brown people just weren\u2019t down with Bernie like that. Deal with it.\n\nOr not.\n\nWe don\u2019t give a fuck.\n\nFrom: Greg T.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: You\u2019re obsession with white people Why are you so racist against white people. I think you are a good writer, but you take every opportunity to down white people. Your anti-white jokes aren\u2019t even funny anymore. Some white people don\u2019t care about race. It is people like you who are so obsessed with everything white people do or say who keep racism alive. Just like some white people need to get to know black people, you need to get to know some non-racist whites. Most white people are good people who want the same thing in life like everybody black. Sure there are some racists, but they are a small minority of white people. You need to stop focusing on them and find some non-racist white friends. Or maybe you can\u2019t because your the one whose the racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGreg,\n\nFirst of all ... what anti-white jokes? I was being serious. Every single time.\n\nI\u2019m glad you sent this. I have often been accused of being a racist. So often, in fact, that I decided to be proactive about it. The following is a letter that I hand out to anyone who accuses me of racism:\n\nDear Sir or Madam;\n\nThis letter certifies that the holder, Michael Harriot, can\u2019t be racist. We have verified that he, indeed, has at least one white friend, which exempts him from all claims of reverse racism, regular racism, anti-whiteness or hatred of Caucasians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe undersigned signatories hereby vouch for Mr. Harriot that they are his white friends, and he has never complained about their dance skills, demeaned their potato salad or asked them why they kiss their dogs in the mouth.\n\nSigned,\n\nB.

So we intend to enforce our laws.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomeone might want to let Sessions know that Nikolas Cruz, the accused gunman in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School mass shooting, purchased his gun legally, which proves that current gun laws might be ineffective.\n\nBut Sessions wouldn\u2019t be Sessions if he didn\u2019t find a way to bring up gang violence\u2014which, unless Sessions is talking about the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d gang, which Cruz appeared to belong to, really has no place in this discussion.\n\n\u201cWhen parents once again go to sleep fearful that their kids will not be safe, even when they go to school\u2014parents have told me in gang-infested neighborhoods that children can no longer stand at the bus stop by themselves\u2014they take turns, parents do, of being out there every morning and afternoon,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve gotta confront the problem. There\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI guess it doesn\u2019t matter to Sessions that Parkland is not a place terrorized by gang violence. Or that Parkland was just named Florida\u2019s safest city in 2017, according to an analysis by the Washington-based National Council for Home Safety and Security.\n\nI don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so hard for the Trump administration to call homegrown terrorism by its name. If I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d think that the current administration emboldens this brand of hate and then preys on white America\u2019s fear by pulling out tired tropes about gang violence to avoid the obvious issues of homegrown hate and unbridled access to guns.\n\nWatch below:", "keywords": ["school", "nonsensical", "symphony", "jeff", "racist", "laws", "gun", "think", "know", "violence", "whistles", "parkland", "speech", "florida", "way", "gang", "sessions", "shooting"], "polarity": -0.06926666666666667, "subjectivity": 0.5059333333333333},

I had come for a work event, and ended up with some extra time on my hands in the city.\n\nI should have been on a plane on my way back home to Los Angeles, but the way my airline was set up, they overbooked the flight and offered me a travel voucher plus a hotel room for the night if I took a flight the next day instead.\n\nMy girlfriend and I were having a light dinner and drinks at a bar in midtown. We\u2019d consumed plenty of tequila and were laughing and talking when I saw him out of the corner of my eye.\n\nYou can always tell when someone is sizing you up\u2014at least, I can. I could feel him looking at me even before I turned to see who it was. His silhouette was already commanding a presence in my peripheral.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI turned, ever so slightly, to glance at him. He was looking right back at me. I flashed my cutest and slyest smize before returning my attention to my drink.\n\nIt worked.\n\nHe made his way over to us, and I pretended not to notice him as I laughed at something my friend said that wasn\u2019t even that funny. Corny, I know, but that worked, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe leaned toward me and said, \u201cExcuse me.\u201d\n\nHis voice was deep and smooth. I turned toward him and took a good look at him.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d I said and gave him a once-over.\n\nTall\u2014over 6 feet. Thick, full beard. Bald head. Chocolate skin. A suit that looked like it was made specially for him. A matching pocket square and tie. Nice shoes. An air of confidence that was noticeable but not put on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI had to come over here because I spotted you and that lipstick from all the way across the room,\u201d he said, smiling. His teeth were perfect.\n\nI smiled but said nothing.\n\nHe leaned a little closer, his voice lower this time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be funny, but you looking like a whole snack. Can I eat you?\u201d he asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI laughed and said \u201cSir\u201d loudly.\n\nMy girl laughed. He turned, unshaken, to look at her. He flashed a grin at her, then turned back toward me and looked expectantly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the most expensive dish on the menu, sir,\u201d I said. My girl laughed again. This time, I joined her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithout missing a beat, he said, \u201cIt ain\u2019t tricking if you got it.\u201d\n\nThe next giggle caught in my throat.\n\nListen. If you are quick on your feet with the witty comebacks, you are well on your way to winning with me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe had my attention.\n\nWe bantered back and forth for a few minutes. I signaled the bartender for my check as he flirted with me.\n\nHe was smooth, and the lines he came with after that first one were clever and flattering. He never took his eyes off me, even when his friend walked up and stood just off to the side of us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the bartender put my check down, he immediately snatched it up.\n\n\u201cI got it,\u201d he said. He took out an American Express card and slipped it inside without even looking at the bill.\n\nMe and my girl looked at each other and smirked.\n\nIt was a player move. He wanted us to know that the amount of the bill was of no consequence to him; he carries no balances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe see you, sir, I thought to myself.\n\n\u201cWe can pay for our own check,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cNo, please,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me.\u201d\n\nMore banter. As we talked, I had my phone in my hand because I was live-tweeting everything that was happening. In that moment, everything is funny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAre you texting your boyfriend?\u201d he asked.\n\nI laughed and looked back at my girl again, who was giving me the look. She slowly rolled her eyes to the left, and I took in his homeboy for the first time.\n\nHe. Was. Not. Cute.\n\nMy girl could tell I was warming up to my guy, and she gave me the look, like, Bitch, you better not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Man had signed the bill and was already asking me what we were planning to do next.\n\nI made up some vague story about us having another spot to hit, and he continued smooth-talking me and my girl until we were convinced to go along with them to another bar, where we were joined by his brother.\n\nIn an effort to both give me and my girl a moment to ourselves and not look like a creep, he arranged for us to ride in two separate Lyfts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy girl was only slightly annoyed, but she warned me that if his brother wasn\u2019t cute, we were leaving the next bar as soon as we walked in.\n\nHis brother was very cute.\n\nWe hung out with the three of them until very late, drinking, laughing, listening to music and having a good time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr. Man and his brother invited us back to their hotel suite. It\u2019s clich\u00e9 and probably a little dangerous, but we went anyway because it was summertime in New York City; we were buzzed off of alcohol, laughter and good vibes; and the mood was right.\n\nWe started out sitting in the living area as a group, but slowly broke off into pairs.\n\nWe lay side by side on his bed talking about everything from my career as a writer to his lifestyle as a lawyer in Miami.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe massaged my scalp, gave me a back rub and played with my feet.\n\nI licked his lips, got high off of his scent and fell asleep with my face smushed into his chest.\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t drool once, thankfully.\n\nThe next day, as we parted ways, we exchanged phone numbers.\n\nHe saved me as \u201cTo Be Continued\u201d in his phone.\n\nI saved him as \u201cHe Did That\u201d in mine\u2014because he did, in fact, do that.\n\nBut it would take an entirely new column just to explain how ...\n\n(To be continued next Friday)", "keywords": ["incidents", "took", "laughed", "looking", "looked", "turned", "serial", "look", "wasnt", "girl", "life", "nonmonogamist", "sir", "way"], "polarity": 0.15045436045436042, "subjectivity": 0.4349194324194323},

Even with multiple states legalizing the use of medicinal and/or recreational marijuana, the U.S. attorney general has made it his personal mission to squash that industry and those who participate in it like a bug. He even issued an order last month encouraging prosecutors to aggressively enforce federal marijuana laws.\n\nSessions\u2019 dedication to preventing anyone from being able to use marijuana legally is now being challenged in court. A federal lawsuit filed against Sessions and the Drug Enforcement Administration in New York City in July hit the docket Wednesday, the New York Times reports, and now both sides will have the opportunity to present their case before a judge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe plaintiffs in the case include former NFL player Marvin Washington, who says his business interests in states where marijuana is legal are being impeded by the Controlled Substances Act. Washington argues that the act violates the Constitution\u2019s commerce clause. The second plaintiff is 12-year-old Alexis Bortell, who has epilepsy and says the law makes it impossible for her to travel legally with the only medication that has helped control her seizures.\n\nThe third plaintiff is the nonprofit Cannabis Cultural Association, a group that assists minorities in the marijuana industry. It claims that the Controlled Substances Act has been used to discriminate against minorities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoseph A. Bondy, one of the lawyers who brought the suit, told the Times: \u201cIt\u2019s the first time a young child who needs lifesaving medicine has stood up to the government to be able to use it. It\u2019s the first time that a group of young millennials of color has stood up to the government and said the marijuana law is wrong and has destroyed their communities.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit also points out blatant hypocrisy on the part of the U.S. government when it comes to marijuana. While the government claims that pot is a dangerous substance, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services obtained a patent on the compounds in marijuana in 2003 to protect against brain damage. In 2015, former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said publicly that marijuana has medical benefits.\n\nOn Wednesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Samuel Dolinger asked Judge Alvin Hellerstein to dismiss the case because \u201ccourts around the country have considered similar or identical claims and have rejected them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Hiller, lead counsel for plaintiffs in the case, told reporters after the hearing: \u201cThere is a well-established body of case law that when the facts change, the courts have to change, too. If you only decided case law based upon what people thought years before, we would never have Brown v. Board of Education. \u2026 We would never have Windsor. We wouldn\u2019t have marriage equality.\u201d\n\nJudge Hellerstein openly admitted in court that marijuana does not meet one of the three requirements for Schedule I drug status.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYour clients are living proof of the medical applications of marijuana,\u201d Hellerstein said to Hiller during the hearing. \u201cI have to take the plausible allegations in your complaint as true. How could anyone say that your clients\u2019 lives have not been saved by marijuana? How can anyone say that your clients\u2019 pain and suffering has not been alleviated by marijuana? You can\u2019t, right?\u201d\n\nBut Hellerstein also questioned whether the DOJ\u2019s decision should be challenged in district court.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of things district judges have to do,\u201d Hellerstein said. \u201cWhen agencies are set up to do the very kind of thing that you want me to do, I think the right thing is to defer to the agency.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHellerstein did, however, delay making a decision on the government\u2019s request to dismiss the case.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to consider the issues over the next several days or weeks until he comes to a conclusion,\u201d Hiller said.\n\nLet\u2019s hope the judge allows the suit to move forward, because making marijuana a Schedule I drug is one of the more ridiculous moves our government has made.", "keywords": ["claims", "hiller", "act", "begins", "young", "jeff", "vs", "hellerstein", "battle", "court", "federal", "drug", "clients", "case", "marijuana", "sessions", "law"], "polarity": 0.07758658008658008, "subjectivity": 0.3954274891774892},

Sadly, the frat\u2019s January 2017 inauguration probate show at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., was poorly attended despite the fact that Chrisette Michele performed at the after-party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike most frat houses, the MAGA house is littered with McDonald\u2019s wrappers, guys who don\u2019t mind forcing themselves on pretty freshmen and a collection of party animals who never worry about studying. But they are highly regarded because their frat parties are epic.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never been to a Toupee Dawg party at Mar-a-Lago, they are legendary pussy-grabbing-paloozas. People come from as far as China to attend the homecoming bash. I tried to get into one of the toga parties, but they wouldn\u2019t let me in.\n\nAt least I think it was a toga party, because everyone was wearing white sheets ... and white hoods. They were all gathered around this beautiful campfire in the shape of a lowercase \u201ct,\u201d saying something about \u201cYou will not replace us,\u201d which is probably one of their secret fraternity songs. It looked like a lot of fun!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is speculation that the entire fraternity could be kicked off the yard because of an ongoing investigation by Robert Mueller. Allegations of sexual misconduct and fixing chapter elections have swirled around Grand Basileus Donald Trump, who didn\u2019t pledge because he is a legacy.\n\nTrump serves as dean of pledges despite the fact that he is considered \u201cpaper.\u201d He is known as one of the toughest, most unhinged members of the frat, who loves to \u201cbreak out the wood,\u201d according to former pledges, insiders and Stormy Daniels.

Although I survived, I was paralyzed and, soon thereafter, charged with aggravated assault and resisting arrest, charges that were thrown out three years later.\n\n\n\nSince that fateful incident, which began as a \u201croutine\u201d traffic stop, I\u2019ve chosen to use my platform as an activist and a motivational speaker to promote greater police accountability, and to call for an end to racist policing practices that continue to keep black and brown communities under siege.\n\n\n\nThis is one of many reasons that I find Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 latest dog-whistling to be so alarming.\n\n\n\nThis week, Sessions spoke before a meeting at the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association, where he praised the office\u2019s \u201cAnglo-American heritage.\u201d His remarks were a thinly veiled reference to law enforcement\u2019s well-documented and persisting link to the Ku Klux Klan and its history of suppressing black Americans and other people of color through physical and systemic violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe deeply problematic context behind his words was best summed up in a tweet sent out later that morning by Bernice King, daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, who vocally opposed Sessions\u2019 judgeship back in 1986.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nPredictably, a Department of Justice spokesperson attempted to convince the public otherwise, saying that Sessions was merely using an antiquated legal term used by lawyers and legal scholars. Perhaps that explanation would have flown if Sessions\u2019 comments were not the latest in a long string of examples demonstrating his use of the attorney general\u2019s office to promote a white supremacist agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Sessions\u2019 mention of Anglo-Americanism as separate from other aspects of American heritage was obviously intended to celebrate only white sheriffs and police officers.\n\n\n\nThe auspicious timing of Sessions\u2019 remarks is also telling. Just last week, Mapping Police Violence and Boston University published new data highlighting the connection between structural racism and racial disparities in fatal police shootings. Key findings from the first-of-its-kind study show that:\n\nOf 1,147 people killed by police in the U.S. in 2017, 25 percent, or 282 people, were black, despite making up only 13 percent of the population.\n\n30 percent of black people killed by police in 2015 were unarmed, compared with 21 percent of white victims.\n\nA strong association was found between the racial disparity in fatal police shootings of unarmed people and structural racism in states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis data drives home the inherent truth behind Sessions\u2019 speech: Black and brown communities are being disproportionately targeted and killed because America\u2019s justice system continues to be governed by people with a vast lineage of racial subjugation and violence. The attorney general\u2019s comments only reinforce the dangerous notion that law enforcement is bound not just by duty but also by racial and ethnic heritage to exert power in any way it sees fit, while using racial profiling, intimidation and abuse as its tried-and-true policing tools.\n\n\n\nThis is the legacy that allows structural inequities to persist, and for cases like mine and countless others across the country to happen. Despite Sessions\u2019 romanticized interpretation of history, racism and white supremacy are firmly baked in our nation\u2019s DNA. To accomplish real, lasting transformation of our deeply flawed criminal-justice system, other lawmakers and the whole of society must meet this hard truth head-on and break all ties with the torchbearers of America\u2019s racist past.\n\n\n\nLeon Ford is a police-violence survivor, activist and author of the forthcoming book Untold.

Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), affectionately known as \u201cAuntie Maxine.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom day one, Auntie Maxine has been adamant that she had no interest in working with an administration that wades deep in the waters of bigotry, racism and xenophobia.\n\n\u201cMy feet are firmly planted on the ground and dealing with the reality of things and what\u2019s happening and what\u2019s going on,\u201d she told The Root shortly after the president took office. \u201cIt has not been difficult; I just know that we are now going to have a new president. I don\u2019t care for him, I don\u2019t trust him and I know what I\u2019ve got to do.\u201d\n\nAuntie Maxine has been true to her word, whether it\u2019s been on the House Financial Services Committee, where she challenged Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to actually answer her questions\u2014it was this moment that spawned the heartfelt viral Auntie Maxine \u201creclaiming my time\u201d meme\u2014or speaking out against the atrocities of this administration whenever a microphone is in front of her. She has been adamant about Trump\u2019s impeachment and has constantly referred to the president as a con man.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows who this bully is,\u201d Waters told MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes on Monday, the Daily Beast reports. \u201cThis is a dishonorable human. He is a con man. He came to this job as a con man.

She was the only woman and person of color to graduate from her University of Virginia Medical School\u2019s Class of 1967, and most notably, she went on to become the director of the Office of Research on Women\u2019s Health at the National Institutes of Health, a position she retired from in 2011.\n\n\u201cAnd to then think,\u201d Pinn continued, \u201cthat more than 50 years later, I\u2019d come back here [Charlottesville, Va.] to see a major building with my name on it is pretty amazing.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 13, 2017, UVA renamed the medical education and research building (formerly known as Jordan Hall) Pinn Hall (schedule conflicts delayed the change that was initially planned for 2016).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s amazing indeed, given the past and present context of race relations in Charlottesville. Just one month earlier, torch-toting racists, Klansmen and Confederate sympathizers marched on the University of Virginia\u2019s campus there during a deadly weekend of protests around the removal of a Confederate monument. Three people died before that rally ended.\n\nThe built environment is so much more than shelter, urban planning and architecture\u2014it reflects our very commitment to democracy. Our statues are monuments to the state of our democracy as much as they honor our beloved. Our willingness to take down racist traitors also signifies.\n\nTo be clear, Confederate monuments are a myopic aggrandizement of a warped historical narrative\u2014a storyline that rationalizes past and present oppression. White House chief of staff John Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general, no less, perpetuated the Confederate fable in an interview last week by saying that Robert E. Lee, the traitor who fought against the Union and whose statue was at the center of the protest in Charlottesville, was an \u201chonorable man\u201d and that the Civil War was brought about by a \u201clack of an ability to compromise.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUVA has come a long way in honoring Pinn, but the calamities that transpired a month earlier in Charlottesville show how much further our democracy has to go.\n\n\u201cI hope the image of my name on a building is not seen as a representation of my personal accomplishment,\u201d said Pinn. \u201cI hope it represents inspiration for black women who face similar battles today to what I dealt with in the past.\u201d\n\nShe knows that her success, while important, cannot substitute for social change that goes beyond individual acceptance and assimilation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a black woman, Pinn navigated a white, male-dominated field to serve her country by literally healing victims of physical and social ailments at the NIH.\n\nIt\u2019s more than a notion to think that racism and sexism kill more people than diabetes. Middle-class, educated black women exhibit worse health outcomes than their white peers. Black women can\u2019t educate or buy their way to better health outcomes, because racism and sexism are like airborne pollutants, affecting everyone who comes in contact with them.\n\nWe have to change the social, political and, yes, the built environment that reflects our world, to improve conditions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUVA, a public university, rightly showed gratitude to Pinn and democracy by naming a building after an authentic hero.\n\nPinn trained hundreds of physicians in her academic appointments at Howard University College of Medicine, Harvard Medical School and Tufts University. As a director at NIH, she mentored researchers and advanced policies that would improve outcomes for women. As past president of the National Medical Association, a nonprofit professional organization representing black doctors and their patients, she projected the voice of disenfranchised communities.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine how much worse off women would be without Pinn\u2019s life\u2019s work, which gets us closer to a more perfect union. We need that UVA hall to bear Pinn\u2019s name, to remind us of the values we should honor and celebrate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fight around monuments is an extension of blacks\u2019 perpetual struggle with claiming space\u2014our existential battle for control and representation. From our resistance against highways being built on top of black communities to shuttle whites into suburbs to whites gentrifying formerly redlined districts, the fight to claim space and democracy goes well beyond which monuments are taken down.\n\n\n\nTake \u2019Em Down NOLA, a group instrumental in the removal of four Confederate monuments in New Orleans, also demands that the city of New Orleans \u201cdevelop a community-driven process [emphasis our own] for the removal of the monuments and the choosing of their replacements,\u201d according to the organization\u2019s website.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFacing death threats and other acts of intimidation, such activists should be considered modern-day heroes worthy of more than a page in the history books. It\u2019s past time we made room in public spaces for people who actually deserve our respect. The removal of Confederate monuments from public spaces isn\u2019t about erasing history; it\u2019s about honoring the people who make it.\n\nThis story was produced by the Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education, in partnership with The Root.", "keywords": ["honors", "monuments", "uva", "past", "pinn", "magic", "democracy", "removal", "medical", "women", "vivian", "university", "black", "fables", "replacing", "blackgirl", "confederate"], "polarity": 0.09348519388413003, "subjectivity": 0.3459384882257224},

About 5,360 people participated in the large-sample poll.\n\nRespondents were asked to express varying levels of agreement or disagreement with different prompts. They also had the option of selecting a neutral answer, \u201cNeither agree nor disagree,\u201d as well as \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nAttacks on White People\n\nA central tenet of white nationalism is the belief that white people are under attack in this country, whether it be by losing their status as a majority group (this is the basis of so-called white genocide) or by perceived \u201creverse racism.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn total, 39 percent of respondents agreed to some extent that white people were currently \u201cunder attack\u201d in the U.S. Only 29 percent of white people disagreed with the statement, compared with more than half of nonwhites (54 percent).\n\nNearly a third of total respondents (31 percent) agreed that the country needs to \u201cprotect and preserve its White European heritage.\u201d The percentage of people who disagreed was only slightly higher at 34 percent.\n\nThere was also a clear partisan divide.\n\nA strong majority of Republicans agreed to some extent that white people are under attack in this country (63 percent), which isn\u2019t altogether surprising given the racially charged\u2014and just outright racist\u2014rhetoric the GOP has employed through the years. But while the rate of Democrats who agreed that whites are under attack was comparatively low, at 21 percent, that still indicates that a fifth of \u201cprogressive\u201d respondents subscribe to one of the so-called alt-right\u2019s core beliefs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupport for Black Lives Matter\n\nMost of the survey\u2019s respondents felt that \u201call races should be treated equally\u201d (89 percent) and that people of different races should be allowed to live wherever they choose (70 percent).\n\nBut survey participants didn\u2019t express that same positivity toward Black Lives Matter, a group that advocates for the fair and equal treatment of black people under the law. Less than a third of respondents said they supported the organization\u2014an additional 24 percent said they had neutral feelings about the group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, the percentage of people who opposed Black Lives Matter (37 percent) was similar to those who opposed anti-fascists, or antifa (39 percent).\n\nKeeping Confederate Monuments in Place\n\nConfederate monuments throughout the U.S. have become a cultural flashpoint. As for white supremacists, preserving these statues is central to their drive to \u201cprotect and preserve\u201d white European heritage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe majority of total respondents\u2014three-fifths\u2014expressed that Confederate monuments should remain in public spaces, compared with a quarter who said they should be removed.\n\nMore than half of black Americans said that the statues should be taken down (54 percent), but a greater portion of white people (67 percent) indicated that the monuments should stay in place.\n\n\u201cNeutral in the Face of Oppression\u201d\n\n\n\nThe UVA report notes that the amount of \u201cmiddling\u201d answers\u2014that is, respondents who neither agreed nor disagreed with statements\u2014was striking, especially given today\u2019s polarized political climate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut one of the Ipso pollsters, Julia Clark, noted that neutrality isn\u2019t quite what it appears on first glance.

The new neo-Nazis then left the area without incident.\n\nAfter the report was made public, UT President Greg Fenves issued a statement detailing the incident, adding:\n\nThe University of Texas is committed to free speech and the robust exchange of ideas among students, employees and invited visitors\u2014but our campus is not open for non-university-affiliated groups to stage protests or gatherings. Those that have been warned about these rules and do not leave or who return to campus are subject to arrest.

For someone as obsessed with basketball as I am, this might seem odd. But I have a few perfectly rational reasons for this lack of viewership:\n\nThe second draft of my book is due soon, which means that some days I\u2019m working from 9:30 a.m.-ish to 5 p.m.-ish (on VSB stuff) and then from 9 p.m.-ish to 2 a.m.-ish (on book stuff).\n\nThe team that\u2019s usually my favorite to watch (the University of Pittsburgh) might have been the worst team in major Division I basketball this year.\n\nI\u2019m playing basketball three times a week now.\n\nMy nephew is the starting point guard for his high school team, and I\u2019ve been to several of his games.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve watched enough to have a general idea of who is good, and I know enough to know who the top NBA prospects are. So when I filled out my bracket this year, I went with Arizona\u2014the team that has the best NBA prospect (DeAndre Ayton) and three other players (Rawle Alkins, Dusan Ristic and maybe Allonzo Trier) who might be in the league.\n\nAnd then Arizona got blown the fuck out.\n\nUsually, when a lower seed beats a high seed that\u2019s thought to be a title contender, it\u2019s because the lower-seeded team shot the lights out. Or the higher-seeded team couldn\u2019t hit shit. Or maybe the game showed that the teams were actually a bit more equal than the seeds would suggest. But Buffalo beat Arizona like they were a No. 1 seed and Arizona was a 16. They didn\u2019t just beat them. They punked them. In the last five minutes of the game, Arizona just gave up. It was such a display that even though it ruined my bracket, I was rooting for Buffalo to run up the score.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now, the day after that\u2014and the day after Trae Young was knocked out, too\u2014I want everyone\u2019s brackets to be as fucked as mine is.

I want to see Texas Southern and Trae Jefferson (my new favorite player in college basketball) in the championship game.\n\n(Also, if you have a minute, watch these clips of Jefferson in high school. You won\u2019t be disappointed.)\n\nBefore Arizona lost, I was normal and well-adjusted Damon. I was Damon with dreams and goals and a savings account.

According to the Post, the comment was written last week in response to a Facebook post about a Black Lives Matter event in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nSince the comment came to light, officials at the university have issued statements blasting Muir's comments and distancing themselves from the lecturer.

In doing so, they make the American Dream seem attainable. If we just fix ourselves, we can achieve our goals. For some people, the American dream is attainable, but to understand the chances for everyone, we need to look dispassionately at the factors that shape success. . . .\u201d\n\nFor Lithwick, writing for Slate, such contemplation might be beside the point. \u201cI have no idea whether Winfrey plans to run for the Oval Office in 2020,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAccording to reports, she is \u2018actively\u2019 considering it.

What I do believe is that tribal officials must create systems within our government that will foster transparency and accountability. The only way this can be done is by helping our elected officials and program heads to be more accessible to the media. I am giving away some industry secrets, but the functionality of our tribal government is that important.\n\n\u201cA more effective method of delivering information about the inner workings of any institution is through [unbiased] third-party journalists who are working for established media outlets. . . .\u201d\n\nShort Takes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupport Journal-isms Go Fund Me page.\n\nJoin the list of supporters.\n\nRichard Prince\u2019s Journal-isms originates from Washington.

At least that\u2019s the conclusion of \u201cWhy It\u2019s Hard for Conservatives to Date in D.C. Right Now,\u201d a piece in The Washingtonian magazine that\u2019s become all the talk in Washington circles this week. Or at least some Washington circles.\n\nConservatives (mostly men) in the article lament that D.C. liberals would rather swipe left than settle in for a night of Tucker Carlson and chill. The dating deficit isn\u2019t just affecting the men, though. Conservative women who\u2019ve swarmed D.C. since Donald Trump got into office are forced to alter their dating choices, too. From The Washingtonian:\n\n\n\nConversely, a young White House staffer says she typically looks for someone from the South when swiping through profiles, as she thinks they\u2019ll be more receptive to her support of the President.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: She\u2019s looking for a white guy from the South. I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s not on BlackSinglesMeet.com scrolling for alumni from FAMU. Which got me thinking: Are black conservatives having the same dating problems as white conservatives in D.C.? Is there some lonely black Republican guy out there wondering why Lisa, Angela, Pamela and Renee never responded to his Diamond and Silk Chit Chat Live Evite? Is there some black Republican woman out there trying to turn men\u2019s heads who\u2019s frustrated because everyone thinks her \u201cLock Her Up\u201d T-shirt is advertising a new spot on 14th Street to get their braids done? I took an unofficial survey of every black Republican I know to get to the bottom of this mystery.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObviously, this polling has some limitations\u2014most of the black Republicans I know are already married, and it was hard finding LGBT black Republicans. I know a few, but to this day, I have yet to meet a black lesbian Republican. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re out there, riding unicorns and paying for Janelle Mon\u00e1e tickets with four-leaf clovers dipped in vibranium, but I couldn\u2019t find any before deadline.\n\nThe vast majority of people I spoke to said that being a conservative or a Republican didn\u2019t hurt their D.C. dating prospects at all. If anything, it may have helped. The people I spoke to agreed to share their stories on the condition that their identities be kept secret. So The Root promised to be one of the few outlets in D.C. that WON\u2019T leak Republican testimony.\n\n\u201cMy boys introduce me as \u2018That\u2019s my Republican friend,\u2019 and women are, like, intrigued,\u201d said one prominent GOP state party member in his late 40s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI know Republicans who get play, and I know some that are wack,\u201d said a Gen X Republican married to a woman who worked on former President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign. \u201cI mean, most folks don\u2019t bang with 45 like that, so if that\u2019s how you start and end every conversation, what do you expect?\u201d\n\nThe emerging theme was that being a black Republican wasn\u2019t as big a problem so long as:\n\nYou focused on the black part.\n\nYou weren\u2019t a Trump-supporting black person.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been a problem for me,\u201d a millennial black Republican who works in media said. \u201cI mean, my girlfriend knows I\u2019m a black man. She knows that the lens through which I live my conservative politics is as a black man. Besides, her momma said, \u2018As long as he isn\u2019t one of those TRUMP conservatives,\u2019 and I definitely am not!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve dated lots of men I don\u2019t agree with,\u201d said a 40-something black woman who works as a newspaper editor. \u201cBut Trump supporters are assholes!\u201d She noted that a co-worker set her up with a Trumper about a year ago.\n\n\u201cHe was very handsome, successful, but so arrogant,\u201d she said. \u201cHe went on and on about how journalists should be locked up and how immigrants are ruining America.\u201d Clearly lapsing into the worst date of her life, \u201cAnd you know the worst part? He was a Jamaican immigrant!\u201d\n\nA lot of what I was hearing spoke to the way that black folks navigate \u201cparty\u201d politics versus universal issues when it comes to dating and mating. For many, being a Republican is like a form of code-switching, and potential dates accept that, but \u201cTrumpism\u201d is a lifestyle choice that will get you no love. I swear on a stack of secondhand copies of Gifted Hands that most black men and women in Washington would go on a date with a small-government, lower-taxes, pro-life potential bae, and even listen to some shading of Obama, but there are limits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI went on a few dates with a black Republican soon after I moved to D.C. Everything was cool until we started talking about Black Lives Matter and she turned into Stacey Dash. Not the \u201cAll Falls Down\u201d Stacey Dash, but Fox News, \u201cWe should cancel Black History Month and I hate BET even though I used to twerk in their videos,\u201d hypocritical Stacey Dash.\n\nI think this woman found political debates to be sexy, but by the time she was explaining why black folks shouldn\u2019t be given access to police dashcam and bodycam video because we\u2019d \u201cjust go crazy and riot,\u201d it was a wrap. I wanted to just give her a prepaid Metro card back to the sunken place, but I was too much of a gentleman; and besides, she probably would have liked it.\n\nMy extensive survey and lab work could only lead to one conclusion: Conservative white, Trump-loving people must suck at dating in D.C., because black conservatives aren\u2019t having these problems. Also, this isn\u2019t just a Trump issue; Breitbart complained about the same thing during the Obama administration, and Tomi Lahren\u2019s living Dorian Gray painting, Ann Coulter, said the same thing under Bush.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo why a whole article about it? What would compel a few \u201cMAGA\u201d-hat-wearing men and women to whine to The Washingtonian that their weekends are as empty as a Trump Christmas party?\n\n\u201cThat was just some \u2018woe is me\u2019 white-boy stuff right there,\u201d said the GOP state official. \u201cThey think they\u2019re entitled, but look, you enabled this guy [Trump]; you\u2019re complicit in what this country is going through. Why should anybody throw you the box?\u201d\n\nNever fear, though, young white conservatives. There are still some options for the less-than-discerning, Trump-supporting D.C. dater. Just know that the first 20 minutes might cost you about $130,000, but you definitely won\u2019t be judged for riding the Trump train.", "keywords": ["chill", "carlson", "ones", "dating", "know", "trump", "tucker", "black", "republican", "dc", "women", "men", "date", "white", "doing", "fine", "conservatives"], "polarity": -0.026833694083694067, "subjectivity": 0.4630097402597401},

No one gets any work done anyway, he said, so why not just give everyone those two days off? This was not the first and will not be the last time I'll hear someone make a similar joke. March Madness will have such a grip on our country in the next couple of weeks that, while it'll never, ever, ever happen, it's not completely illogical to give everyone a few days off of work. The joke is also accidentally apropos. What better, more American way to honor this annual celebration of athletes working for free than to not work and still get paid?\n\nAh yes. You knew it was coming. Just as the NCAA tournament receives our national focus, this is also the time of the year where the discussion about student-athletes getting paid reaches a critical mass. It often goes the same way. A smart take on the NCAA will publish on The Atlantic or Grantland or Deadspin. The ridiculous amount of money made from the NCAA tournament (not sure of the exact amount, but I think it's roughly $17 trillion an hour) will get cited, as well as all the people making millions (the schools, the coaches, the school administrations, etc) off of the labor of the athletes who see none of that cash. Sure, the piece will also note, athletes get a free college education. But then it'll also include the fact that saying \"Hey, we gave you something that's worth $40,000 for free!\" while cashing a $17 trillion dollar check is like, I don't know, someone saying \"A tsunami is about to hit our island. Can you help?\" and someone else saying \"Well, here's an umbrella.\" Also, the piece will cite the numerous academic scandals at high profile universities as more proof that many of these trillion dollar check cashing schools have no interest in making sure their athletes actually receive an education. It might even mention that \"four year scholarships\" are actually one year renewable. Meaning that an athlete's scholarship can get revoked after one year for any reason. And, if it mentions that, it might cite example of athletes dropped from their scholarships because of injury or because the coach just needed an extra scholarship to give to someone else.\n\nSome people will listen to this conversation and agree that this is an injustice. They'll concede that student-athletes are being exploited and should be allowed to receive some sort of compensation for their work. We'll call these people Group A. Today, as these types of conversations about the NCAA seem to be more prevalent, Group A seems to be growing. I don't have any numbers in front of me, but it feels like there are more people in 2015 in favor of student-athletes receiving compensation than there would have been in 1995.\n\nHowever, three groups still remain strong.\n\nGroup B: The people who agree that student-athletes are being exploited, but just don't give a fuck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGroup C: The people who do not agree that student-athletes are being exploited, and believe that a free college education is acceptable compensation. They also don't give a fuck, but their don't-give-a-fuckness is principle-driven.\n\nGroup D: The people who stand to profit from the NCAA's current economic model, and do not want any change.\n\nOf these, Group D is both the most hypocritical and the most understandable. If your income is directly tied to other's lack of income, it makes perfect sense why you'd be invested in the status quo. Group B and Group C, however, make less sense. Especially when considering that these are often otherwise intelligent and thoughtful people who recognize inequality and injustice in other ways but, for whatever reason, have a blind spot when it comes to college athletes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, it makes less logical sense. Emotional sense, however, is different. And this is where the blind spot comes from.\n\nAlthough there are dozens of NCAA sports, football and men's basketball are the ones at the center of this conversation. NCAA football and men's basketball teams are filled with 18 to 22 year old young men. Many of whom are Black, some of whom would not be anywhere close to a college campus if not for sports, and all of whom were stars in high school and are likely among the preferred class of students in college. Being part of the preferred class of college students means they receive lots of perks; some social (women, automatic elevated social status, etc) and some academic (free books, better meal plans, first dibs with class and dorm selections, etc). And, on top of that, they go to school for free! Basically, their lives seem to be much better than the lives of 99% of college students. And, because their lives seem to be much better than the lives of 99% of college students, some people \u2014 often people who were part of that 99% \u2014 have a very difficult time conjuring much sympathy for any type of \"injustice\" they might be facing.\n\nWhen you think about this, it makes sense why some of these same people could refuse to buy Nikes or shop at Walmart because of how they treat their workforce, but have no fucks left to give about college athletes getting exploited. It's the exact same concept, the only difference being that the Walmart workers and the people in the Nike sweatshops are presumed to be poor and powerless while supporting NCAA reform means you're basically saying that you're in favor of this 6'3, 220 pound superstar athlete with free classes, free tutors, free food, free pussy, and free social status also getting paid. But, that only difference is a huge fucking difference. Maybe not logically. But emotionally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the bright side, March is already halfway over. Which means we're all a couple weeks away from giving absolutely no fucks about this conversation for another 11 months. In the mean time, fill out those brackets.

Because Sessions straight up lied during his Senate confirmation hearing, claiming that he\u2019d never met with Russian officials, he recused himself from all Russia-related matters.\n\nNow, according to several reports, Trump was not only pissed that Sessions recused himself from the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into potential ties between Russia and the Trump campaign, but he reportedly ordered his top lawyer to try to stop Sessions from doing so.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, White House counsel Don McGahn, acting on orders from the president, tried but failed to persuade Sessions not to recuse himself.\n\nNBC News reports that McGahn and several White House officials called Sessions to insist that he not recuse himself, but Sessions had already made up his mind after reports surfaced that Sessions had conveniently forgotten to disclose contacts he\u2019d had with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter recusing himself in March, Sessions would suddenly remember several interactions he had with Russians during Senate committee hearings in June and October.\n\nA White House lawyer for Trump, Ty Cobb, told NBC News that he had no comment on the Times report.\n\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that the Trump administration has been vocal about Sessions\u2019 recusal. In fact, during a July press conference, Trump blatantly stated that he didn\u2019t believe that Sessions should have taken himself out of the investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe should not have recused himself from the Russia investigation almost immediately after he took office, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me prior to taking office, and I would have quite simply picked somebody else,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to the presidency.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne thing has been consistent since Trump took office, and that\u2019s the fact that skullduggery, lying and Russia\u2019s raiding of the White House fridge at ungodly hours is the new state of the nation.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what comes out of this administration; at this point, this is how I feel about every claim lobbed at the president:\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the New York Times and NBC News.", "keywords": ["recuse", "probe", "house", "persuade", "jeff", "recused", "trump", "investigation", "reports", "report", "urged", "russia", "white", "times", "lawyer", "sessions"], "polarity": 0.020730027548209365, "subjectivity": 0.3796700773973502},

As long as the weed smoker wasn\u2019t attached to a cartel or distributing the drug to minors, police could basically behave like security at a Cypress Hill concert.\n\nNo one knows how Sessions plans to proceed because, like most things with this Azealia Banks-ass administration, rescinding Obama policy seems to be the only focus.

She lifts the shirt over her head to reveal a white woman in a cream-colored shirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ad hit a sore spot for black people. For years, soap companies advertised their products as being able to wash the black off of people.

The speech painted a dystopian image of an America riddled with violent crime and promised a higher \u201ctooth-to-tail ratio\u201d in combating it.\n\nSessions\u2019 remarks gave criminal-justice-reform advocates plenty of reasons to worry: The thrust of the Department of Justice\u2019s efforts to curtail violent crime would focus on drug arrests and prosecution, including adding 40 new federal prosecutors, according to Fox 6 Milwaukee.\n\nSessions began by hyping up his boss, whose carnage-filled vision of America was mirrored in Sessions\u2019 own speech.\n\n\n\n\u201cPresident Trump was elected as the law-and-order president. He was elected to make America safe again and to have the backs of our men and women in blue,\u201d Sessions said, according to Fox 6 Milwaukee.\n\nHe also congratulated law enforcement on the 20-year decline in crime rates before harping on a recent two-year uptick in violent crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat trend has reversed. The violent crime rate is up by nearly 7 percent. Robberies are up. Assaults are up nearly 10 percent,\u201d Sessions told the room. \u201cRape is up by nearly 11 percent. Murder is up by more than 20 percent.\u201d\n\nAbsent, of course, was any context for these numbers\u2014whether Sessions was talking about arrests or reports was unclear, for example. And an \u201cincrease in rape reports and arrests\u201d (which are notoriously under-reported anyway) doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate that more rapes are happening. Sessions also failed to mention that these increases, while troubling, are still low when viewed within the 20-year period Sessions had just praised.\n\nEarly reports from the Brennan Center for Justice (pdf) also indicate that 2017 may see a reduction in the violent-crime rate, which is being attributed to lower crime rates in Washington, D.C., and Chicago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions was unconcerned with the facts, though, choosing instead to push his favorite pet theories: that drug use is driving homicide rates and that aggressive policing and prosecution would rein in the problem.\n\nCiting a 2015 DOJ study, Sessions told Milwaukee law enforcement that \u201cnearly a quarter of the increase in homicides\u201d were drug-related.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s why I keep saying that drug trafficking is an inherently violent business,\u201d Sessions added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions didn\u2019t mention how many of those homicides were carried out with a trafficked gun\u2014but why would he? He\u2019s repeatedly made clear that he has no interest in imposing harsher punishments for gun violations, because fidelity to the Second Amendment is more important than driving down the homicide rate.\n\nSessions also shared statistics about the increase in deaths from drug overdoses\u2014a tangent that mostly served to underscore Sessions\u2019 rationale for reigniting a war on drugs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in case you were wondering how Sessions plans to bring violent crime rates to heel\u2014and who will suffer\u2014the attorney general made it abundantly clear in the following lines (emphasis mine):\n\nBut let me tell you this: we will not allow the progress made by our women and men in blue over the past two decades to simply slip through our fingers now. Plain and simple: We will not cede a community, a block, or a street corner to violent thugs or poison peddlers.\n\nThis is a call-to-arms for the law enforcement community to double down on drug offenders\u2014and the use of the word \u201cthugs\u201d here makes it very clear who\u2019s first on Sessions\u2019 list. That a nationwide increase in violent offenses has been exaggerated by the administration makes this all the more worrisome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, Sessions will be in North Carolina, where he\u2019s scheduled to formally announce the DOJ\u2019s strategies to combat violent crime.\n\nRead more at Fox 6 Milwaukee.", "keywords": ["dishonest", "drug", "increase", "nearly", "continues", "hook", "enforcement", "violent", "crime", "rates", "safe", "sessions", "watch", "america", "tour", "law"], "polarity": -0.05507908213790566, "subjectivity": 0.5412173556291204},

Yet when members of the Justice Department appeared before the House Judiciary Committee, no one seemed to be able to explain exactly what the document is or how or why it was created.\n\nHere\u2019s how columnist Clarence Page described the document for the Chicago Tribune:\n\nPrepared by the FBI\u2019s Domestic Terrorism Analysis Unit in August and first reported last month by Foreign Policy\u2019s website, the report singles out a \u201cBlack Identity Extremist\u201d movement, or \u201cBIE,\u201d as a violent threat motivated by \u201cperceptions of unjust treatment of African-Americans and the perceived unchallenged illegitimate actions of law enforcement.\u201d And who is this movement? The report describes a half-dozen highly publicized killings of police officers by black perpetrators in various cities and links them under the \u201cBIE\u201d label based on no other apparent connection but their reported hatred for police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem with the report is everything. The FBI, the nation\u2019s top law enforcement agency, doesn\u2019t seem to know anything about it; nor does the Department of Justice. Not only does no one seem to be able to explain who \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d are, but they have been considered and noted as domestic terrorists.\n\n\u201cThe FBI assesses it is very likely Black Identity Extremist (BIE) perceptions of police brutality against African Americans spurred an increase in premeditated, retaliatory lethal violence against law enforcement and will very likely serve as justification for such violence,\u201d reads the report, marked for official use only and obtained by Foreign Policy.\n\n\u201cThe FBI assesses it is very likely incidents of alleged police abuse against African Americans since then have continued to feed the resurgence in ideologically motivated, violent criminal activity within the BIE movement,\u201d the report states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet the only person who seems to be holding top brass accountable is Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), who left Attorney General Jeff Sessions befuddled and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein speechless.\n\nDuring a House Judiciary Committee hearing in November, Bass pressed Sessions to explain the report.

The #MeToo movement has inspired victims of sexual misconduct to come forward with their stories of abuse, and we\u2019ve seen some (only some) horrible, powerful people face consequences for their actions. It hasn\u2019t, however, translated to the music industry, and it certainly hasn\u2019t benefited women of color.\n\nA new BuzzFeed report addresses that head-on through the story of Jerhonda Pace\u2014the 24-year-old mom of three who came forward with her story of being physically and sexually abused by R. Kelly in August 2017, a few months before the Weinstein news. Maybe it\u2019s poor timing, but R. Kelly continues to exist within the industry, completely unperturbed. Will Pace ever see justice? Will any of R. Kelly\u2019s victims, for that matter, with some abuses dating back to 2000?\n\nWhen Pace was 15, she met her idol outside the court where his child-pornography trial was held in 2008. Abuses followed, and she waited to tell her story until 2017 because of a series of nondisclosure agreements she signed in exchange for cash.\n\nPace told BuzzFeed about coming forward before the Weinstein news and watching the fallout afterward:\n\nI was livid, because when their stories came out, they received so much attention. It was just crazy, and I was like, \u201cWhat about R. Kelly\u2019s victims? What about us?\u201d Nothing happened for us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also recounted all the conversations she\u2019s had with FBI agents and the experience of not being believed:\n\nI really think that it\u2019s something that has not been taken as seriously as it should \u2026 I didn\u2019t feel that [any of the investigators] were passionate about it and that they were going to pursue it the way that it needed to be pursued. I was told that they want more witnesses to corroborate my story, which makes no sense: I\u2019m the victim; I have the proof: He was paying me, I have the contract he signed, I gave them the DNA T-shirt, I gave them everything proving I was there, and they were like, \u201cWe need more people to say that they saw you [with Kelly].\u201d\n\nAll the while, R. Kelly continues not only to exist without consequence\u2014he thrives. Kelly performed at the Little Caesars Arena in Detroit on Feb. 21, and last year he hit the Billboard charts when he recorded \u201cJuicy Booty,\u201d with Jhen\u00e9 Aiko and Chris Brown, another known abuser.

I didn\u2019t smoke weed in front of her. What I actually did was whip out a joint and tell her I was going to smoke it in her bathroom, where she regularly smokes her cigarettes to keep her apartment from smelling like tobacco. So I was actually trying to be respectful by hotboxing her bathroom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen she saw the joint, she made that face mothers make right before they say, \u201cWhat you not gon\u2019 do \u2026 \u201d But my mother didn\u2019t say anything. She just shook her head and walked away.\n\n\n\nNow, my mom kinda suspected that I was a weed smoker. But when California finally legalized recreational marijuana\u2014or adult use of marijuana, which some pro-cannabis activists prefer because, honestly, no one ever says \u201crecreational alcohol\u201d or \u201crecreational cigarettes\u201d about the two legal vices enjoyed and consumed by grown-ass people\u2014I thought it was time to clear the air, so to speak, and make it plain that I do enjoy legal weed, just as she enjoys her legal cigarettes.\n\nI mention this story because it appears that Attorney General Jeff Sessions might be back on that bullshit about cracking down on marijuana. On Friday he met with a group of anti-legalization activists behind closed doors, and I\u2019m pretty sure they weren\u2019t swapping Christmas-cookie recipes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs far as we know, Sessions has never met with pro-pot activists during his first year in office. And last week, a video emerged showing Sessions in full asshole mode mocking a Department of Justice intern about her stance on marijuana while making a few misleading statements of his own (more on that later).\n\nSessions, who\u2019s been pretty wishy-washy about marijuana policy as attorney general, has famously said, \u201cGood people don\u2019t smoke marijuana.\u201d But that statement defies logic when you consider that 29 states have legalized medical marijuana and seven states plus Washington, D.C., have co-signed recreational weed. Maybe he doesn\u2019t know any good people, which isn\u2019t hard to believe, to be honest.\n\nBut Sessions aside, there is still a pretty strong social stigma around people who use weed. The image of the stoner stuck on a couch eating Cheetos is probably the first thing that comes to mind for most people when they think of a weed smoker, which is why it\u2019s time for the good, weed-smoking people of America to let it be known that they happily puff-puff-pass while still managing to contribute to society.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvidence has shown that weed is less dangerous than alcohol and tobacco, yet the federal government classifies it as a Schedule I drug, the highest classification, which puts marijuana on par with heroin. Our government thinks weed is more dangerous than Schedule II drugs cocaine and crystal meth, which is fucking bananas.\n\nSessions once even claimed that marijuana was \u201conly less awful than heroin,\u201d which is utter horseshit when you consider that the number of overdoses from opioids like heroin and prescription painkillers skyrocketed in 2016. (Sessions just recently conceded that weed isn\u2019t as bad as heroin. Gee, thanks, little buddy!)\n\nYou know how many people have died from a marijuana overdose in the history of marijuana? Zero.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA recent study even suggested that opiate-related deaths went down after Colorado legalized recreational marijuana, and some experts believe that cannabis could actually help ease the abuse of opioids, which account for 63 percent of all drug-related deaths.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of opioids, in that video with the intern, Sessions claimed that last year was the first time that drugs rather than alcohol caused more fatal car accidents. He\u2019s basically correct on that point (the year was actually 2015), except the issue is more nuanced than that.\n\nSince police still don\u2019t have a reliable DUI test for weed (officers are mainly just judging behavior to determine if a driver is high), it\u2019s difficult to know what role, if any, weed may have played in an accident, especially since marijuana stays in your system awhile after actual use. But what Sessions failed to mention is that there\u2019s also been a huge spike in prescription-opioid-related fatal car crashes (however, the same rule about no reliable DUI test also applies to opioids).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions also asked that intern to check with the American Medical Association about the dangers of marijuana. Again, while Sessions is right that the AMA says marijuana is a dangerous drug and recreational weed should not be legalized, he didn\u2019t mention that the organization has also called for more research on both the positive and negative effects of cannabis. Because legalization is moving way faster than research, rescheduling the drug to open up scientific study makes even more sense from a public health point of view.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that black and brown people are still getting arrested at higher rates for marijuana possession, even in states with legal weed, so coming out wholeheartedly as a weed smoker still carries some real-life consequences (the prohibition of weed has always been primarily about race).\n\nBut really, the best way to destroy the stereotypical image of a pothead is to replace it with an image that looks more like you and me.

One of his major policies since becoming attorney general has been green-lighting policy that allows police to take the cash and/or property of people suspected of but not charged with crimes.

It\u2019s as valid as the First Amendment.\u201d The attorney general knocked the notion that marijuana is \u201charmless\u201d and \u201cdoes no damage.\u201d \u201cMarijuana is not a healthy substance, in my opinion,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerican Medical Association is crystal clear on that.

The #MeToo founder has been rightfully getting her shine since the movement bearing the name she coined caught Hollywood\u2019s attention last fall. In the months since, she has appeared on red carpets, been honored in Time magazine, and become a regular on the talk and news show circuits.\n\nBut amid all the fanfare, the one thing Burke has never neglected is her mission to support and protect black and brown girls and women, a point she made abundantly clear when she appeared on Comedy Central\u2019s The Opposition With Jordan Klepper on Thursday\u2014her segment begins at the 15:31 mark.\n\n\u201cWe started #MeToo because it was an exchange of empathy between survivors, to let them know that they\u2019re not alone,\u201d she said.\n\nSince Klepper\u2019s show is satirical, he naturally played devil\u2019s advocate when discussing the need and motives of #MeToo, voicing the increasingly irrational concerns of men who likely feel that the movement endangers their right to sexual entitlement. When asked by Klepper about the danger of conflating sexual harassment and assault under the umbrella of a single hashtag, Burke illustrated the larger danger of ignoring the insidious nature of sexual harassment:\n\nThere\u2019s no conflation; there\u2019s actually a spectrum. And so, sexual harassment and sexual abuse and sexual violence are on a spectrum. On one end, we have sexual harassment, which creates hostile environments and make people uncomfortable and really open a gateway for more intense violence. So they can all live under the same hashtag.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe went on to point out that #MeToo\u2019s actual mission is \u201cempowerment through empathy\u201d\u2014a mission that we share here at The Glow Up. When Klepper playfully quipped that he thought empathy to be synonymous with weakness, Burke very seriously replied:\n\nEmpathy is actually the opposite of weakness; it is the power between two people. ... When one person says to another person, \u201cMe too,\u201d that person has shared something about a trauma that they experienced. The other person is empowered by that; it\u2019s the power in knowing that you\u2019re not alone, it\u2019s the power in knowing that somebody believes you, and hears you, and sees you, and is there for you.\n\nBut ever the comedian, Klepper wasn\u2019t done, ribbing Burke on why she continues to fix her social media gaze upon alleged serial sexual abuser and pedophile R. Kelly. Through Klepper\u2019s satirical lens, Kelly\u2019s only relevance should be related to his record releases. Burke coolly responded with the clapback of the night: \u201cYou know what else he hasn\u2019t released? The women that he\u2019s holding captive in houses in Atlanta and Chicago.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I tell you that I stood up and applauded and whooped with the studio audience! And as always, Burke brought the movement back to black and brown girls and their specific vulnerability\u2014and invisibility\u2014in discussions of sexual abuse.\n\n[P]eople tend to not care about things that affect the most marginalized amongst us. [Kelly\u2019s] victims, the people who he seeks out are vulnerable girls who come from vulnerable communities, and they look like me, mostly. ... [N]ow\u2014largely because of this movement\u2014we are bringing more attention to people like R. Kelly and hoping that we can take him down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll in all, in our current era of catchphrases, memes and passing trends, Burke\u2019s appearance on The Opposition was a cogent reminder that our collective work must continue, even\u2014no, especially\u2014amid all the well-deserved attention.

I wish all the people I represent the very best in all their future endeavors,\u201d Cirrincione said a statement to Deadline.\n\nBerry had reportedly dropped Cirrincione some years back over allegations that he used her name to come on to up-and-coming actresses.\n\nEarlier:\n\n\n\nA prominent manager of African-American talent that once included Halle Berry and currently includes Taraji P. Henson is the latest man in Hollywood to be accused of sexual harassment. This time, nine women of color\u2014eight black, one Asian\u2014have accused Vincent Cirrincione of unwanted sexual advances (and, of course, public masturbation) over a period beginning in 1993 and ending in 2011.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Washington Post broke the story Friday. Cirrincione allegedly used his prominence to \u201cprey upon young women of color seeking an entry into Hollywood,\u201d according to the report.\n\nThe first woman cited in the article, Tamika Lamison, says that she was 27 years old when she was at Cirrincione\u2019s hotel room for an impromptu audition after the Tony Awards when Berry called. Cirrincione put the star on speaker. The Post reports:\n\nWhen the call ended, Lamison began reciting a poem she had written. Midway through her performance, she said Cirrincione grabbed her and started kissing her, sticking his tongue in her mouth. She said he told her that he could take her on as a client, on the condition that he would get to see her for sex whenever he wanted. She said she pushed him away and left.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf the nine women, three say that Cirrincione pushed for sex as a condition of representing them, and that he did not take them on when they refused. A fourth said that he offered to help advance her career if she agreed to have sex with him monthly. A fifth actress said that he masturbated in front of her in his office during the years he managed her.\n\nBerry reportedly cut ties with Cirrincione three years ago after hearing about the allegations against him.\n\n\n\n\u201cOver three years ago, a woman was on the radio saying that Halle Berry\u2019s manager was her worst casting couch experience ever.

But even with his denial, something didn\u2019t feel right in my spirit, and with the possibility that it could be true, I immediately ended our over-25-year relationship,\u201d she told the Post.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Post reports that Cirrincione and Berry co-produced Introducing Dorothy Dandridge for HBO in 1999.\n\nOn Friday, Berry spoke out again on Instagram, saying she\u2019s \u201clivid that [Cirrincione] used me.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBerry said that the manager had never made an inappropriate gesture toward her.\n\n\n\nHenson, who has been managed by Cirrincione for two decades, said that she never heard of or witnessed any inappropriate behavior by Cirrincione toward women.\n\nIn fact, she says, he really helped her when she was struggling.\n\n\u201cHe saw a single mother trying to make her dreams come true, and he nurtured that,\u201d Henson told the Post. \u201cHe wrote checks and wouldn\u2019t ask for anything in return. It wasn\u2019t coming from a creepy place. If anything, it empowered me. Like, this man believes in me. I love him for that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs with Berry, Cirrincione has also been Henson\u2019s producing partner; Henson\u2019s publicist, Pam Sharp, is Cirrincione\u2019s longtime girlfriend, according to the Post.\n\nIn a statement, Cirrincione responded to the criticisms:\n\nWe live in a time where men are being confronted with a very real opportunity to take responsibility for their actions. I support this movement wholeheartedly. I have had female clients and employees my entire career in this industry. I have built a reputation for advancing the careers of women of color. I have had affairs while in committed relationships, ones I am now ashamed to say are coming to light and shading my past and my reputation. I can say without a doubt that I have never used favors, sexual or otherwise, as a reason for managing anyone. I want to make it clear that not one of those relationships were anything but consensual. I take responsibility for my part in the situation and I am not here to diminish anyone\u2019s feelings or experiences. I apologize to these women, my past and present partner, my clients and employees for the pain this is bringing them. I was under the impression I was living my life as a supportive man to women. It is with a heavy heart that I see now I was wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of the nine women make accusations of rape or criminal misconduct.

Years before her success as a television host, she dominated New York City radio as a shock jock obsessed with celebrity gossip and provocative chitchat.\n\nShe spat vitriol that scathed her targets and caused many of them to retaliate, most notably Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs back in 1998, after she spread rumors that he was gay. The hip-hop mogul flexed his influence so hard, Williams was blackballed in her industry, bringing her career to a full stop for a number of years. But it was as clear then as it is today that she gives zero fucks about what rolls off her tongue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of this #MeToo movement,\u201d she said during her show\u2019s \u201cHot Topics\u201d segment. \u201cI love that people are speaking up for the first time and coming out and everything, but now it\u2019s got\u2014I look at all men like, \u2018You\u2019re a #MeToo.\u2019 All of them. All of them, which is not fair.\u201d\n\nAnd in response to the recent #MuteRKelly campaign, Williams had this to say: \u201cWhat is this, 10 years too late? It\u2019s not going to work. Black people aren\u2019t really good at protesting. Not since the King march ... R. Kelly wasn\u2019t a \u2018me too.\u2019 Aaliyah voluntarily married him when she was 15 years old. Her parents voluntarily let her do it.\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019 recent comments in response to the #MeToo and #MuteRKelly campaigns are, in my opinion, her most vile and disgusting to date. Not only did she de-emphasize the activists\u2019 initiative to aggressively protest at R. Kelly performances (at whatever point in time), but she argued on the crooner\u2019s behalf. Williams basically absolved Kelly, co-signed his statutory conduct and lambasted the young women who were linked to him.\n\n\n\nHer level of victim-blaming is both disturbing and reckless. Williams chided late songstress Aaliyah\u2014and, inaccurately, her parents\u2014for consenting to marriage with the R&B pervert. She also claimed that the teen girls who are currently part of Kelly\u2019s harem are willing participants\u2014and faulted their parents for that, too. And perhaps worst of all, the host also told her viewers that the 13-year-old girl allegedly featured in Kelly\u2019s sex tape\u2014whom he purportedly urinated on\u2014\u201cwas down with it.\u201d All because Williams is \u201csick of the #MeToo movement.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrankly, I am sick of Wendy Williams.\n\nWilliams\u2019 statements and defense of R. Kelly are a slap in the face to female survivors of sexual abuse, vulnerable girls and the movements that advocate for them. She is one of many black women whose thinking is so patriarchal, they engage in a brand of misogynoir that is not only foul AF, but downright dangerous.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s internalized racism and internalized misogyny,\u201d Stacey Patton told The Glow Up. Patton is assistant professor of multimedia journalism at Morgan State University and the author of Spare the Kids: Why Whupping Children Won\u2019t Save Black America. She said:\n\nThere\u2019s a long tradition of this, deeply tied to the history of slavery and racism. One of the core features of the racialization of black bodies is to create this narrative that they\u2019re sexual deviants. Black [women] have participated in that discourse, softly believing that if they adhere to rules about what it means to be a virtuous woman, that somehow it makes us more acceptable to society. So we can\u2019t, even in our imagination, believe young black girls can be victimized in this way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams\u2019 narrative reeks of toxic femininity. In many black communities and households alike, young girls are emotionally victimized\u2014largely by women, long before they encounter men. They are unfairly sexualized according to their attitudes, bodies and mannerisms. Some of us may be familiar with the term \u201cacting womanish\u201d being directed at black girls. For those who are not, Dorothy Randall Tsuruta made it plain in her article for the Western Journal of Black Studies, where she explained:\n\n[The] culturally-derived concept, womanish (\u201cmannish\u201d for boys) is rooted in the social practice of Black adults, especially Black women, setting boundaries for Black girls.\n\nThough writer Alice Walker is sympathetic in redefining the expression to embolden young girls with womanish characteristics, many women remain stuck on its original connotations. They wax old toxic philosophies onto innocent girls\u2014much as Williams does, when she faults underage girls for their engagement with Kelly\u2014knowing full well that the law and power dynamics involved clearly define them as prey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t divorce that shaming of young black girls from the [parent] shaming we see online,\u201d Patton said, speaking of the extremes some women will go to to guilt their daughters.\n\nNothing good comes from this toxic policing of our girls. It upholds the patriarchal idea that black girls are fast-ass Jezebels who are sexually mature beyond their years and need to be subdued. It denies them the opportunity to be exactly who they are\u2014young girls. This castigation chips away their confidence, diminishes their self-esteem and stunts their agency. It robs them of the tools needed to protect themselves from being exploited\u2014sexually or otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams\u2019 dismissal of black women\u2019s agency is akin to silencing them. In a broader context, it contributes to the erasure of black women\u2014as if patriarchy, white feminism and the world at-large don\u2019t already have that task covered.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this before\u2014when the FBI, white liberals and activist groups tried to suppress the female voices of #BlackLivesMatter by co-opting their agenda. More recently, we saw it when ESPN suspended Jemele Hill for \u201ca second violation of social media guidelines\u201d\u2014also known as expressing her views as a black woman about a \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d president. The attempt to quiet black women is overwhelming, and where we don\u2019t need it is in spaces or conversations among our own.\n\nThe #MuteRKelly campaign is long overdue. For over 20 years, Kelly has reportedly engaged in felonious sex with underage women and allegedly continues to do so with impunity. This is mainly because the black community has not held Kelly or other sexual miscreants like him accountable. The fact that the #MuteRKelly campaign\u2019s creators, Kenyette Barnes and Oronike Odeleye, have come through to do the extreme lifting that no one else bothered to do speaks volumes to their commitment to black woman and girls. That Williams denigrates their efforts by stating, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work,\u201d further confirms that she does not value the voices of black women or their resistance.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOdeleye considers the slight a plus, telling The Glow Up:\n\nBy bringing up the #MuteRKelly discussion on the national stage, Wendy Williams helped spread the message that there are black women nationwide standing united to end the sexual, physical and mental abuse of our young black women. . .Wherever R. Kelly is performing, we\u2019ll be there. We won\u2019t rest until we have, at the very least, ended his career. We are working with the victims, victims\u2019 families and attorneys to bring yet another criminal case against him. We plan to be a needle in his side until he\u2019s in the poor house, a mental facility or a jail cell.\n\nTarana Burke, founder of the Me Too movement, also feels that Kelly\u2019s time is up and that he should not be \u201cconveniently\u201d left out of conversations on sexual assault, especially among black women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlack women are just as vocal about giving R. Kelly a chance. I\u2019ve seen Facebook statuses that say, \u2018I don\u2019t care who [R. Kelly] is fucking, I\u2019m going to see him tonight\u2014I\u2019m buying my ticket,\u2019\u201d Burke stated in a phone interview with The Glow Up.\n\nThe Me Too movement founded by Burke in 2006 is not be confused with the latest #MeToo movement tied to the sexual harassment and rape of women in Hollywood. Although the two intersect today, initially they did not. Burke\u2019s movement was specifically started for underserved black girls from low-income communities who were sexually victimized and in need of supportive healing.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Burke responded to Williams\u2019 inflammatory comments:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSexual violence knows no race, color, class or gender, but the response to sexual violence does,\u201d Burke said in our interview. \u201cThe response to sexual violence is highly gendered and highly racialized and definitely defined by class.\u201d\n\nYeah, that part.\n\nIt is this nuance that allows R. Kelly to get off scot-free. Williams is reckless and clearly driven by her black female antagonism in not making these distinctions. That Williams (and black women of the same ilk) can afford to be so \u201csick of\u201d #MeToo is really quite disconcerting. In the same vein as Kelly, she is both a trigger and the gun, busting shots at black women, exploiting them and denying their humanity. Like R. Kelly, Wendy is out here wildin\u2019, and she, too, needs to be put on mute.", "keywords": ["muterkelly", "r", "wildin", "williams", "black", "assault", "sexual", "wendy", "women", "metoo", "comes", "girls", "twisted", "kelly", "young"], "polarity": 0.01676189520560382, "subjectivity": 0.48182343778370257},

Black women showed up and showed out in various ways. Black men put their careers and livelihoods on the line to speak out against racial injustice, police violence, and sexual assault and harassment. Creative artists experienced amazing glow ups, and black teenagers all over the country showed that no matter what, still we rise. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the biggest winners of 2017.\n\nBlack Activism\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a year that began with us getting the worst president in the world, black activists continued to do the work to help black people stay alive and get free. That activism took on many forms\u2014from protests both loud and silent to creative arts projects to writing\u2014and it was prolific in the year 2017.\n\nBlack people fought and continued to fight for clean water for the people of Flint, Mich., as well as other cities; social justice; economic justice; and an end to the state-sanctioned murder of black people at the hands of police. These fights are not over, and if 2017 was any indication, our voices will only get louder in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyonc\u00e9\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 broke the internet in February when she announced that she was pregnant with twins via an Instagram post, and her year went on an upswing that has not ended. Although we know she has plenty of haters, it\u2019s hard to understand how you can hate on someone so graceful, so beautiful, so talented and so free in her own black womanhood. Her pregnancy led to the birth of beautiful twins\u2014 which she has blessed us with time and time again. Oh, and Sir and Rumi were cute, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer charity and generosity are not always made public, but she gives from the heart when it matters most. Not to mention, her after-pregnancy snapback was real and an inspiration to us all. Deep down inside, she is just a \u201cTexas bama\u201d who has her fangirl moments just like the rest of us, and we are here for it. Long live Queen Bey.\n\nFenty Beauty\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all have our own favorite makeup brands, but when Rihanna announced that she would be launching Fenty Beauty in September, black girls (and the rest of y\u2019all) went crazy. No, she didn\u2019t make it just for us, but she made it for us in that she kept black girls in mind when creating the color ranges. The products flew off the shelves faster than they could be stocked.\n\nFenty had other beauty lines shook time and time again because Fenty had the range. Just one month in, Fenty had $72 million in earned media value, showing us that the combination of Black Girl Magic and black-girl social media capital is a guaranteed win. Right on, Fenty. Right on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack High School Seniors Accepted to College\n\nDespite being told by America every single day that their lives don\u2019t matter, black students continued to push forward and show that yes, the hell they do. Even as people tried to call them underachievers and say they are destined to a life of nothingness, black kids stood up and loudly proclaimed, \u201cYes, we can!\u201d Whether they were getting accepted to all eight Ivy League schools, heading off to Harvard or fulfilling their dream of going to their favorite HBCU, black high school seniors did the damn thing in 2017, and we are proud of y\u2019all. Keep pushing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardi B\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe don\u2019t dance no more, she makes money moves. If you look up the phrase \u201cglow up\u201d in the dictionary, right after the definition of the new vertical on The Root, there will be a picture of Cardi B, her tongue hanging out and the look of win on her face, because she seriously glowed up in 2017. Regardless of how you may feel about her, your hate and a Grammy snub won\u2019t stop her shine. She signed big deals, had one of the biggest hits of the year (my current theme song/anthem), got big props from the Queen herself\u2014and despite rumors of a potential breakup, her boo Offset proposed to her with an 8-carat diamond ring. Cardi did 2017 big as hell, and we can only expect that will continue in 2018.\n\nTerry Crews\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt takes a black man who is strong in will and mind to display restraint and not beat the shit out of a perverted white man who gropes his genitals in full view of everyone at a Hollywood party. It takes an even stronger black man to come forward during the #MeToo storm and admit that he, too, was sexually violated by a powerful white man in Hollywood. That strong black man was Terry Crews.\n\nWhile some questioned why he didn\u2019t just pummel Adam Venit when the Hollywood power broker allegedly grabbed his genitals at a party, Crews showed that it\u2019s a game of chess, not checkers, and in the end, the sound mind wins. He filed a police report, filed a lawsuit and spoke out against sexual assault in Hollywood, letting everyone know that he would not be a victim. He was named one of Time magazine\u2019s \u201csilence breakers.\u201d He dropped WME\u2014the agency Venit worked for that basically did nothing to protect Crews and everything to protect Venit\u2014and moved on to new representation, all without being the stereotypical angry black man that everyone wanted or expected him to be.\n\nThat is the very definition of winning. Kudos, Terry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarack Obama\n\nBarack Obama won 2017 the day he left office as the president of the United States. I am very sure it was like when Scarface quit his job in Half Baked.\n\nOur president started wearing less and going out more. He sent his wife a cute Valentine\u2019s Day tweet. He got crowds and applause just for being a regular-ass dude. People wanted so much more of him, the bidding war over his memoirs reached $60 million. He received the 2017 JFK Profile in Courage Award. He even reported for jury duty in Chicago. He basically showed everyone that leaving the presidency hasn\u2019t stopped his shine or his charisma, and your orange-colored Oompa Loompa of a president could never. Come through, Barack. Come through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColin Kaepernick\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNFL ratings are down, and league officials don\u2019t know what to do about it. Good. The NFL deserves whatever \u201cL\u2019s\u201d it gets because the NFL turned its back on Colin Kaepernick. Meanwhile, Kaepernick continues to shine. When he started his silent protests during the national anthem last year, he was widely criticized by people who didn\u2019t understand his need and desire to fight for black lives or the recognition he got for it. None of that matters. Despite it all, Kaepernick is living his best life. He has gotten award after award, and he is even considering buying an NFL team. Take that, NFL. Long live Colin Kaepernick.\n\nBlack Women\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2017 was the year of the black woman. From your Auntie Maxine Waters to Serena Williams winning the Australian Open while pregnant to Karen Bass\u2019 hilarious takedown of Jeff Sessions to black women showing up to guarantee Roy Moore did not win in Alabama to Tarana Burke and the #MeToo movement, black women were here for you.

Some of the stories shared through the #MeToo movement have triggered a range of emotions and questions; some may have come off as \u201cgray areas.\u201d How do we actually know when we\u2019re giving or given consent?\n\nSo glad you asked. Sexual consent is when both parties agree to have sex\u2014throughout the encounter. Let\u2019s start with the basics\u2014we\u2019ll call it \u201cConsent 101\u201d\u2014and then explore some less orthodox situations:\n\n\n\nDo I Really Need to Hear a \u201cYes\u201d?\n\nWell, yeah. You do. Hearing \u201cyes\u201d from your partner is\u2014and should be\u2014sexy as fuck. Speaking personally, nothing turns me on more than a partner who respects my wishes and wants to know my needs. When the chemistry is there, then ask questions like, \u201cIs it OK to touch ___?\u201d or \u201cDo you mind if I ___?\u201d Some people might consider this a mood killer, but guess what? Jail time and being heavily judged by your peers as a rapist are definite libido killers.\n\nIf You\u2019re Not Sure, Question It\u2014and Actually Get a Confirmation\n\nThey didn\u2019t say no, but they didn\u2019t say yes, either. Again: You NEED confirmation from your partner. To assume is making an ass out of you and me; so take away the doubt and question it. And don\u2019t stop there\u2014actually get a solid answer. Most times, body language can tell you a lot, even without words. If your partner is getting tense, ask again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsent Isn\u2019t Only Given by a Woman\n\nAllow me to burst a few bubbles: Consent isn\u2019t something that\u2019s gender-specific. If you think women are exempt from being sexual predators, think again. And if you think men are excluded from being victims, you\u2019re delusional.\n\nHere are some alarming statistics: According to the Connecticut Alliance to End Sexual Assault, 1 in 6 men will be sexually assaulted in their lifetimes\u2014and 1 in 4 of those victims are under the age of 12. These statistics are not mentioned to make women feel that their issues don\u2019t matter, but we need to acknowledge that men can be affected by sexual trauma, too. And we definitely cannot exclude the transgender, genderqueer or nonconforming populace from the conversation\u2014a 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey (pdf) found that 47 percent of transgender people are assaulted in their lifetimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing the Same Sex Doesn\u2019t Give You a Hall Pass\n\nFrom personal experience, I\u2019ve lost count of how many women I\u2019ve had to check for attempting to disrespect my personal space. As a bisexual woman who owns her sexuality, I\u2019ve found that some people fetishize my sexual orientation.\n\nOne night, while barhopping with friends, a plus-one from our outing put her hand on my breasts. Startled, I jumped back and immediately questioned her motives. Despite expressing how her repulsive actions made me feel, she instantly dismissed my feelings, suggesting that I \u201cget over it.\u201d She even pointed to my vagina, to imply that we have the same body parts. It ruined my night, and thankfully, others no longer felt comfortable bringing her to future functions. Violation of anyone\u2019s personal space, same sex or not, is wrong\u2014on a moral and legal level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsent for One Thing Doesn\u2019t Mean Everything Is Covered\n\nJust because I agreed to one sexual act doesn\u2019t mean I consent to do other things. Also, what\u2019s comfortable today may not serve as a kink tomorrow. Frankly, we can be in bed together in the buff, and it doesn\u2019t warrant that we proceed any further than cuddling. If you can\u2019t handle that, state your boundaries up front, too.\n\nAnd While We\u2019re at It, I Can Stop at Any Time\n\nHold tight to your barf bag, boys and girls, because there are plenty of people who believe that if you start, both parties are obligated to finish the act. I don\u2019t care if you are five minutes away from climaxing; when I say stop, it means STOP. And it doesn\u2019t make me a prude or selfish; no simply means no. If there\u2019s even a possibility that your partner may want to slow down or is having second thoughts, with or without explanations, respect their wishes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in the BDSM World, No May Mean Yes\n\nDespite the stereotypes, BDSM is a lot more than just whips and chains. It is heavily dependent on trust in your partner. For those unfamiliar with the abbreviation, it\u2019s broken down into bondage, discipline/dominance, submission/sadism and masochism. As a \u201cswitch,\u201d I learned quickly about the importance of safe words when engaging in sexual activities with partners. Prior to the act, you should truly know your partner\u2019s desires and dislikes.\n\nMost important, establish safe words and touches and understand their body language. Without this discussion, things can go terribly wrong fairly quickly. Because words such as \u201cno\u201d and \u201cstop\u201d can be viewed as \u201cyes\u201d in the submissive and domination community, these terms are typically avoided as cues to stop during the act. Words like \u201cred,\u201d \u201cyellow\u201d and \u201cgreen\u201d\u2014reminiscent of traffic lights\u2014are great word selections. Know the difference between BDSM play and assault.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust a Thought: Avoid Vulnerable Partners\n\nAs an FYI, a heavily inebriated or exceptionally high partner cannot reliably give you consent. If your partner isn\u2019t coherent and you perform sexual acts with this person, this can later be considered equivalent to rape. Alcohol and drugs can impair someone\u2019s judgment severely. If the connection is truly there, ask and wait for validation when the other person is sober.\n\n\n\nIf They\u2019re Not of Legal Age, Guess What?\n\nDo I have to mention that minors also aren\u2019t legally allowed to consent to sexual relations with an adult? On that note: Parents should consider having conversations with teens before they enter junior high school. On average, Americans lose their virginity at 17 years old, but they are experimenting far earlier, so it\u2019s worth gradually sparking conversations about sex, protection and consent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParents: Don\u2019t view it as giving your children permission to lose their virginity, but more about their safety. Sexual education in school is on the decline, and caretakers should feel comfortable taking the responsibility to answer questions that their children may or may not have considered.\n\nRape and Sexual Harassment Are NOT Your Fault\n\nAbove all, know that you didn\u2019t ask for it. Rape and sexual harassment are not your fault. If you were raped or are uncertain whether you were sexually assaulted, please don\u2019t hesitate to seek assistance from organizations like RAINN, which will connect you to support groups or a talk therapist. Reach out to local authorities if you ever feel unsafe from a sexual predator. Know that you\u2019re not alone and that there are a host of places willing to help you through your trauma.

The #MeToo founder has been rightfully getting her shine since the movement bearing the name she coined caught Hollywood\u2019s attention last fall. In the months since, she has appeared on red carpets, been honored in Time magazine, and become a regular on the talk and news show circuits.\n\nBut amid all the fanfare, the one thing Burke has never neglected is her mission to support and protect black and brown girls and women, a point she made abundantly clear when she appeared on Comedy Central\u2019s The Opposition With Jordan Klepper on Thursday\u2014her segment begins at the 15:31 mark.\n\n\u201cWe started #MeToo because it was an exchange of empathy between survivors, to let them know that they\u2019re not alone,\u201d she said.\n\nSince Klepper\u2019s show is satirical, he naturally played devil\u2019s advocate when discussing the need and motives of #MeToo, voicing the increasingly irrational concerns of men who likely feel that the movement endangers their right to sexual entitlement. When asked by Klepper about the danger of conflating sexual harassment and assault under the umbrella of a single hashtag, Burke illustrated the larger danger of ignoring the insidious nature of sexual harassment:\n\nThere\u2019s no conflation; there\u2019s actually a spectrum. And so, sexual harassment and sexual abuse and sexual violence are on a spectrum. On one end, we have sexual harassment, which creates hostile environments and make people uncomfortable and really open a gateway for more intense violence. So they can all live under the same hashtag.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe went on to point out that #MeToo\u2019s actual mission is \u201cempowerment through empathy\u201d\u2014a mission that we share here at The Glow Up. When Klepper playfully quipped that he thought empathy to be synonymous with weakness, Burke very seriously replied:\n\nEmpathy is actually the opposite of weakness; it is the power between two people. ... When one person says to another person, \u201cMe too,\u201d that person has shared something about a trauma that they experienced. The other person is empowered by that; it\u2019s the power in knowing that you\u2019re not alone, it\u2019s the power in knowing that somebody believes you, and hears you, and sees you, and is there for you.\n\nBut ever the comedian, Klepper wasn\u2019t done, ribbing Burke on why she continues to fix her social media gaze upon alleged serial sexual abuser and pedophile R. Kelly. Through Klepper\u2019s satirical lens, Kelly\u2019s only relevance should be related to his record releases. Burke coolly responded with the clapback of the night: \u201cYou know what else he hasn\u2019t released? The women that he\u2019s holding captive in houses in Atlanta and Chicago.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I tell you that I stood up and applauded and whooped with the studio audience! And as always, Burke brought the movement back to black and brown girls and their specific vulnerability\u2014and invisibility\u2014in discussions of sexual abuse.\n\n[P]eople tend to not care about things that affect the most marginalized amongst us. [Kelly\u2019s] victims, the people who he seeks out are vulnerable girls who come from vulnerable communities, and they look like me, mostly. ... [N]ow\u2014largely because of this movement\u2014we are bringing more attention to people like R. Kelly and hoping that we can take him down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll in all, in our current era of catchphrases, memes and passing trends, Burke\u2019s appearance on The Opposition was a cogent reminder that our collective work must continue, even\u2014no, especially\u2014amid all the well-deserved attention. She also made sure that The Opposition\u2019s audience left knowing that #MeToo is far more than a hashtag:\n\n\u201cThe #MeToo movement is here to stay,\u201d said Burke.", "keywords": ["keeps", "focused", "keeper", "movement", "klepper", "sisters", "tarana", "burke", "sexual", "power", "metoo", "harassment", "person", "knowing", "mission"], "polarity": 0.14142149003260113, "subjectivity": 0.49962408990186763},

I shouldn\u2019t have such a high bar for the content of conversations I overhear in a busy food court, particularly in the section immediately adjacent to Panda Express. But alas, I still have the Obama hopey-changey bug, so I ate my orange chicken bowl and smiled warmly at the two suited men who sat next to me. Until they started talking.\n\n\u201cThey got James Franco, too? You can\u2019t even tell a woman she looks nice without getting #MeToo\u2019ed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe gotta be more careful out here. Where\u2019s our safe space?!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one iteration of a conversation I\u2019ve heard from men in the past few months that rests on a bed of balderdash more egregious than Panda\u2019s claim of authentic Chinese food. This particular myth is that:\n\n1. Men are being fired/prosecuted/publicly shamed for innocuous acts like a polite compliment.\n\nThis simply isn\u2019t true. Workplace harassment doesn\u2019t include pleasant niceties. The men who claim as much are either willfully ignorant or painfully stupid. There\u2019s \u201cHi, Sandra, you look nice today,\u201d and then there\u2019s \u201cWow, Sandra, you really filled out that dress well,\u201d which is typically accompanied with a lewd appraisal and delayed stare. Stop this gaslighting now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis idea is often paired with another nasty notion I\u2019ve heard repeated by both men and women (but let\u2019s be honest; according to my unofficial GroupMe survey, it\u2019s 95 percent men):\n\n2. It\u2019s only harassment when the harasser is unattractive or undesirable (e.g., Harvey Weinstein).\n\nFalse. Harassment has nothing to do with the appearance of the harasser and everything to do with the behavior of the harasser (and the fact that the recipient is uncomfortable, nonconsenting or simply not interested).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only do people presume that you want generic Idris Elba from your office\u2014you know, the guy with the confidence of Stringer Bell minus the accent and with a stare that\u2019s more dehumanizing than smoldering\u2014but they presume that your response is an indication of whether or not the act is harassment. Which brings me to the next misconception:\n\n3. If a person doesn\u2019t immediately denounce a harasser or, worse, dares to laugh along, he or she must have liked it.\n\nWrong again. In the \u201950s and \u201960s, when domestics were asked by their employers, \u201cWhat do you think of all this civil rights stuff? We treat you good, right?\u201d they often replied something to the effect of, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t fool with that. I don\u2019t want anything to do with that trouble.\u201d They didn\u2019t mean it then, and women don\u2019t always mean it now when we laugh off men\u2019s harassment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy nature of the power that a harasser often has over a woman\u2014whether it be their seniority, their popularity in the office or simply their ability to make you look like an aggressive woman (and, for some of us, an angry black woman)\u2014women are often left with few choices. So if you hear a conversation like this:\n\nHim: You should wear skirts more often; you\u2019ve got such great legs! No wonder the client loves you. Her: It\u2019s either that or my ability to turn around contracts in record time. Total toss-up! Haha!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s no need for you to conclude that she appreciated it. For one, consider how infuriating it is for women in the workplace, corporate or otherwise, to have to consistently assert to others that we should be judged based on the work we do versus how we look.\n\nSecond, think about the consequences a woman faces for calling out the fan of her skirts. She could be ostracized, viewed as aggressive, dragged through a lengthy HR process that ends in little or no action aside from a waste of her time, or, worse, passed up for opportunities because she didn\u2019t go along to get along.\n\nI realize that most of my examples are related to men harassing women. But that brings me to the next myth:\n\n4. Women are the only recipients of workplace harassment, and the perpetrators are always men.\n\nNope. My husband likes to joke that before he introduces himself to people, he tells them he\u2019s married, just so there\u2019s \u201cno confusion.\u201d While the sexual harassment he\u2019s experienced likely pales in comparison with my own experiences, it doesn\u2019t negate his. He attended a holiday party with me a few years back, and I recall a complete stranger squeezing his bicep while cooing, \u201cI wish my husband would go to the gym.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNah, sis. Keep your hands, feet and all other objects to yourself because I can\u2019t control my reflexes and your health depends on it. (That\u2019s the rule we learned in kindergarten, right?)\n\nIn short, with all that women have to deal with in the workplace\u2014and I\u2019m not even speaking to the unimaginable horrors endured by working-class women and domestic workers who often have no recourse\u2014I can assure you that the majority of us really aren\u2019t interested in entertaining anyone\u2019s advances while there, whether the pursuer is Michael B. Jordan or Flavor Flav, at least not on the clock. The men who know better really aren\u2019t about that life, either.\n\nBe friendly, not flirty. Be fierce, not forceful.

What\u2019s currently prevalent in the pieces responding to Babe\u2019s Ansari story are hyperbole, intellectual dishonesty and red herrings.\n\nIn her response to Babe\u2019s article, \u201cAziz Ansari Is Guilty. Of Not Being a Mind Reader,\u201d the New York Times\u2019 Bari Weiss shrieks, \u201cThe insidious attempts by some women to criminalize awkward, gross, and entitled sex takes women back to the days of smelling salts, and fainting couches.\u201d The Los Angeles Times, unafraid to ask the \u201ctough\u201d questions, pondered, \u201cIs Aziz Ansari a Victim or Perpetrator?\u201d\n\nNot to be outdone in the histrionics competition, The Atlantic published \u201cThe Humiliation of Aziz Ansari,\u201d in which writer Caitlin Flanagan calls Babe\u2019s piece \u201c3,000 words of revenge porn\u201d and eagerly paints \u201cGrace\u201d as a nefarious, resentful, mean girl hell-bent on making Ansari pay for rejecting her, declaring, \u201cTogether, [Grace and Babe writer Katie Way] may have destroyed Ansari\u2019s career.\u201d\n\nIronically, the same parties who stress the necessity of having stringent qualifications for proper claims of sexual assault and victimhood\u2014of which they deem Grace unworthy\u2014have less demanding standards of proof when it comes to bestowing Ansari with their own thorny crowns of victimization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir flimsy concern about \u201cinfantilizing\u201d women is nothing short of laughable as they indulge in their anti-fourth-wave-feminism hysterics and pull a 34-year-old man to their heaving bosoms like vigilant caretakers, rendering him incapable of anything more malignant than simply being a creepy and inattentive sexual partner.\n\nReality is much less fantastical. Babe\u2019s piece, flawed as it may be, did not send society as we know it into a tailspin of anomie. Scores of hapless men who merely attempt conversation or interaction with women who pique their sexual interest are not being apprehended by a feminist gestapo for crimes of rape; nor did it \u201cderail\u201d the #MeToo movement for parties who weren\u2019t already looking for an excuse to dismiss it.\n\nWe do not live in a society where published allegations of sexual assault alone ruin one\u2019s career. If it\u2019s any consolation for the Weisses and Flanagans of the world, they may simply look to the likes of R. Kelly and the current president of the United States for solace in how little such accusations hinder powerful men from thriving.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo date, Ansari\u2014much like most of the celebrities and industry insiders who have recently been accused of assault and misconduct\u2014has not been destroyed by modern-day, bloodthirsty-feminist witch hunts, excommunicated from human civilization or criminalized (pending police investigations into allegations involving Harvey Weinstein and Russell Simmons notwithstanding).\n\n\n\nGrace\u2019s account\u2014one that toggles between acquiescing to certain sexual acts and withdrawing from others\u2014is a pervasive experience. While many seem to direct their ire at Grace for her decisions and at Babe for its treatment of the story, few are expressing resentment toward the societal conditions that demand we present infallible victims with accounts of sexual abuse enshrouded in an impenetrable armor of credibility to even be taken seriously in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s time to be honest: We are a society\u2014a country especially\u2014that despises victims for having the audacity to \u201callow\u201d themselves to be victimized. When Grace describes her reaction to Ansari\u2019s advances\u2014\u201cI stopped moving my lips and went cold\u201d\u2014it was hard for me to imagine that many of us couldn\u2019t relate to that kind of dissociation. When she mentions taking a while to concede to the feeling that she\u2019d been violated, I understood her reluctance to arrive there.\n\n\n\nVictimhood is work. Acknowledging it, vocalizing it, deciding if it merits pressing charges, following through with seeking punitive recourse or any recourse, healing from it, moving on and preparing for the onslaught of interrogation from parties who are more than eager to discredit it\u2014it\u2019s arduous and painful work.\n\nThe choice to \u201cfight back\u201d when you are being pressured or overpowered during sexual interaction makes it all the more real that an assault is happening and could escalate, and the consequential stigma of victimhood all the more imminent. It\u2019s no wonder so many people resent it and try to deny their own proximity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFew sins are worse in America than being powerless. Many of us, especially those of us who may have already cobbled ourselves together after recovering from prior experiences with assault, would rather dissociate and delude ourselves into believing that our own experiences with sexual coercion were just \u201caggressive\u201d or \u201cawkward\u201d instances that we gave into\u2014to avoid having to add another instance of sexual assault to an already loaded plate of trauma.\n\nThe takeaway from Grace\u2019s anecdote isn\u2019t that we should consider every regrettable or uncomfortable sexual interaction as assault (though this anecdote described more than mere discomfort; remember, sexual assault encompasses more than rape). This isn\u2019t about bad sex. It\u2019s about examining how dysfunctional our sexual socialization is for us to read that instance and chalk it up to merely being a \u201cnormal\u201d and clumsy sexual experience. There should be nothing \u201cnormal\u201d about leaving a date in tears because you feel violated, and we shouldn\u2019t be so content and flippant with characterizing it as such.\n\n\n\nUltimately, this is an incident in which many truths can exist; we can acknowledge that it\u2019s probable Ansari\u2019s celebrity and his public persona played a part in Grace wanting to give Ansari a chance to redeem himself during that evening, and even desiring his kindness after he made her uncomfortable. It\u2019s just as probable that Ansari was fully aware of the leverage his celebrity granted him over a green young woman 10 years his junior who was visibly eager to go out on a date with a popular star.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also very likely that a man who has written a book about modern dating in which he elaborates on his habit of determining if a woman is uninterested in him simply by the tone and response time of her text messages is capable of gauging that a woman who recoils from his attempts of getting her to touch his dick for 30 minutes and verbally expresses that she doesn\u2019t \u201cwant to feel forced\u201d is probably not excited about having sex with him, and consent is not static.\n\nFurthermore, claims that men in general are unable to read nonverbal cues and that anything other than a clear \u201cno\u201d confuses them have been debunked in recent studies; researchers conclude (pdf) that men are, in fact, perfectly capable of reading and recognizing nonverbal cues from women who are resistant to sex. The problem isn\u2019t that they don\u2019t understand; they just don\u2019t like the answer.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s OK to feel unsure if what Grace described as the worst night of her life neatly matches with your understanding of assault. That discussion needs to be had if we are to have a rigorous examination of our sexual politics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, accusations of sexual abuse are not all going to look like scandalous, easy-to-condemn, jaw-dropping accounts of egregious brutality and predation, and alleged victims are not always going to behave in ways we understand. Nor should they have to for us to engage them responsibly.\n\nDisingenuous, lazy claims about the \u201cambiguity\u201d of both consent and resistance allow sexual assault to remain ubiquitous. If nothing else, we are a society that firmly believes in questioning the credibility of alleged victims with way more fervor than we do the actions of their alleged abusers.\n\nWe have ample leg room to, instead, fix our gaze on proper ways to handle the stories and best interest of people alleging sexual assault. We can also stand to focus a harsher lens on men like Ansari who pursue rigid sexual compliance in the face of resistance and to admonish their team of toxic acolytes who are more than eager to dismiss their harmfulness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we are to push forward conversations about sexual abuse and all of its variations, we need to be prepared to be uncomfortable, unsure and conflicted. It\u2019s not a precursor to anarchy or a disservice to the movement if we question what we have accepted to be normal and entertain the possibility that we have been harmed or may have also caused harm during the course of our sexual experiences.\n\nRest assured, we have not strayed that far from the status quo.

On Wednesday, the magazine announced that \u201cthe silence breakers\u201d\u2014the victims of sexual harassment and assault who have come forward to tell their stories\u2014had earned the distinction of being its Person of the Year for 2017.\n\nTime Editor-in-Chief Edward Felsenthal told the Today show in an interview Wednesday morning that this year\u2019s #MeToo movement represented the \u201cfastest-moving social change we\u2019ve seen in decades, and it began with individual acts of courage by women and some men too.\u201d\n\nTime\u2019s article features an array of women and men from all backgrounds and walks of life. There are the celebrities who initially grabbed headlines, like actress Ashley Judd, who was the first to go on the record to accuse Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment. But there is also a hospital worker, an engineer, a strawberry picker, a housekeeper, an entrepreneur\u2014all of whom had their portraits taken for the piece.\n\nWhile prominent public figures like Judd and Terry Crews drove the conversation about sexual harassment and sexual assault to the forefront, the article is arguably most effective in showing the scope of a pervasive, global problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Time writes:\n\nThe women and men who have broken their silence span all races, all income classes, all occupations and virtually all corners of the globe. They might labor in California fields, or behind the front desk at New York City\u2019s regal Plaza Hotel, or in the European Parliament. They\u2019re part of a movement that has no formal name. But now they have a voice.\n\nTime magazine says its team spent six weeks compiling stories of harassment and assault, interviewing dozens of men and women in a windowless room in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District. Following Time\u2019s announcement of the Person of the Year, Charlotte Alter, a national correspondent for the outlet, noted on Twitter that the piece was \u201cconceived, reported and written by women.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was fact-checked by women,\u201d Alter added. \u201cThe video was shot and edited by women. The layout and photo spread were designed by women.\u201d\n\nA conspicuous absence on Time magazine\u2019s front cover, though, is that of Tarana Burke, who originally used the phrase \u201cme too\u201d to build solidarity among survivors of sexual abuse more than a decade ago. Burke is featured in both the promotional video for the story and within the article itself.\n\n\u201cSexual harassment does bring shame,\u201d Burke told the magazine. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s really powerful that this transfer is happening, that these women are able not just to share their shame but to put the shame where it belongs: on the perpetrator.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTime does note that people of color\u2014as well as immigrants, people with disabilities, low-income workers and LGBTQ people\u2014face \u201cmany types of dread\u201d when they come forward to report sexual abuse.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf they raised their voices, would they be fired?\u201d the article notes. \u201cWould their communities turn against them? Would they be killed?\u201d\n\nAmong the people of color whose experiences are profiled are Crystal Washington, one of seven employees of the Plaza Hotel who have filed a sexual harassment suit against the hotel; and Adama Iwu, a lobbyist who organized an open letter exposing harassment in the California Legislature. Terry Crews, the most recognizable man to come forward with sexual harassment claims, is also shown prominently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNobody questions the predator,\u201d Crews told Time. \u201cYou know why? Because they just expect it. And I expect it. And I just said, \u2018No more.\u2019\u201d\n\nOf course, not everyone who\u2019s come forward with their stories has been embraced. Anita Hill is rightfully mentioned as a predecessor to the #MeToo movement who did not receive the same groundswell of public support. And among the most conspicuous celebrity absences may be that of actress Lupita Nyong\u2019o, who is among the dozens of women who came forward with stories of Weinstein\u2019s predatory and harassing behavior toward them\u2014and the only one whose story he specifically disputed.\n\nAnd it turns out, Donald Trump, who claimed he would \u201cprobably\u201d have been Time person of the year, did get a mention\u2014as the sexual harasser in chief.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSusan Fowler, a former engineer at Uber, cited the president as a reason she decided to blow the whistle on her former employer.\n\n\u201cI remember feeling powerless and like there was no one looking out for us because we had an admitted harasser in the White House,\u201d Fowler told Time. \u201cI felt like I had to take action.\u201d\n\nRead more at Time.", "keywords": ["come", "names", "silence", "told", "article", "movement", "harassment", "sexual", "women", "magazine", "breakers", "forward", "person", "men"], "polarity": 0.20022434163059163, "subjectivity": 0.4746978715728715},

Years before her success as a television host, she dominated New York City radio as a shock jock obsessed with celebrity gossip and provocative chitchat.\n\nShe spat vitriol that scathed her targets and caused many of them to retaliate, most notably Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs back in 1998, after she spread rumors that he was gay. The hip-hop mogul flexed his influence so hard, Williams was blackballed in her industry, bringing her career to a full stop for a number of years. But it was as clear then as it is today that she gives zero fucks about what rolls off her tongue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of this #MeToo movement,\u201d she said during her show\u2019s \u201cHot Topics\u201d segment. \u201cI love that people are speaking up for the first time and coming out and everything, but now it\u2019s got\u2014I look at all men like, \u2018You\u2019re a #MeToo.\u2019 All of them. All of them, which is not fair.\u201d\n\nAnd in response to the recent #MuteRKelly campaign, Williams had this to say: \u201cWhat is this, 10 years too late? It\u2019s not going to work. Black people aren\u2019t really good at protesting. Not since the King march ... R. Kelly wasn\u2019t a \u2018me too.\u2019 Aaliyah voluntarily married him when she was 15 years old. Her parents voluntarily let her do it.\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019 recent comments in response to the #MeToo and #MuteRKelly campaigns are, in my opinion, her most vile and disgusting to date. Not only did she de-emphasize the activists\u2019 initiative to aggressively protest at R. Kelly performances (at whatever point in time), but she argued on the crooner\u2019s behalf. Williams basically absolved Kelly, co-signed his statutory conduct and lambasted the young women who were linked to him.\n\n\n\nHer level of victim-blaming is both disturbing and reckless. Williams chided late songstress Aaliyah\u2014and, inaccurately, her parents\u2014for consenting to marriage with the R&B pervert. She also claimed that the teen girls who are currently part of Kelly\u2019s harem are willing participants\u2014and faulted their parents for that, too. And perhaps worst of all, the host also told her viewers that the 13-year-old girl allegedly featured in Kelly\u2019s sex tape\u2014whom he purportedly urinated on\u2014\u201cwas down with it.\u201d All because Williams is \u201csick of the #MeToo movement.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrankly, I am sick of Wendy Williams.\n\nWilliams\u2019 statements and defense of R. Kelly are a slap in the face to female survivors of sexual abuse, vulnerable girls and the movements that advocate for them. She is one of many black women whose thinking is so patriarchal, they engage in a brand of misogynoir that is not only foul AF, but downright dangerous.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s internalized racism and internalized misogyny,\u201d Stacey Patton told The Glow Up. Patton is assistant professor of multimedia journalism at Morgan State University and the author of Spare the Kids: Why Whupping Children Won\u2019t Save Black America. She said:\n\nThere\u2019s a long tradition of this, deeply tied to the history of slavery and racism. One of the core features of the racialization of black bodies is to create this narrative that they\u2019re sexual deviants. Black [women] have participated in that discourse, softly believing that if they adhere to rules about what it means to be a virtuous woman, that somehow it makes us more acceptable to society. So we can\u2019t, even in our imagination, believe young black girls can be victimized in this way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams\u2019 narrative reeks of toxic femininity. In many black communities and households alike, young girls are emotionally victimized\u2014largely by women, long before they encounter men. They are unfairly sexualized according to their attitudes, bodies and mannerisms. Some of us may be familiar with the term \u201cacting womanish\u201d being directed at black girls. For those who are not, Dorothy Randall Tsuruta made it plain in her article for the Western Journal of Black Studies, where she explained:\n\n[The] culturally-derived concept, womanish (\u201cmannish\u201d for boys) is rooted in the social practice of Black adults, especially Black women, setting boundaries for Black girls.\n\nThough writer Alice Walker is sympathetic in redefining the expression to embolden young girls with womanish characteristics, many women remain stuck on its original connotations. They wax old toxic philosophies onto innocent girls\u2014much as Williams does, when she faults underage girls for their engagement with Kelly\u2014knowing full well that the law and power dynamics involved clearly define them as prey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t divorce that shaming of young black girls from the [parent] shaming we see online,\u201d Patton said, speaking of the extremes some women will go to to guilt their daughters.\n\nNothing good comes from this toxic policing of our girls. It upholds the patriarchal idea that black girls are fast-ass Jezebels who are sexually mature beyond their years and need to be subdued. It denies them the opportunity to be exactly who they are\u2014young girls. This castigation chips away their confidence, diminishes their self-esteem and stunts their agency. It robs them of the tools needed to protect themselves from being exploited\u2014sexually or otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams\u2019 dismissal of black women\u2019s agency is akin to silencing them. In a broader context, it contributes to the erasure of black women\u2014as if patriarchy, white feminism and the world at-large don\u2019t already have that task covered.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this before\u2014when the FBI, white liberals and activist groups tried to suppress the female voices of #BlackLivesMatter by co-opting their agenda. More recently, we saw it when ESPN suspended Jemele Hill for \u201ca second violation of social media guidelines\u201d\u2014also known as expressing her views as a black woman about a \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d president. The attempt to quiet black women is overwhelming, and where we don\u2019t need it is in spaces or conversations among our own.\n\nThe #MuteRKelly campaign is long overdue. For over 20 years, Kelly has reportedly engaged in felonious sex with underage women and allegedly continues to do so with impunity. This is mainly because the black community has not held Kelly or other sexual miscreants like him accountable. The fact that the #MuteRKelly campaign\u2019s creators, Kenyette Barnes and Oronike Odeleye, have come through to do the extreme lifting that no one else bothered to do speaks volumes to their commitment to black woman and girls. That Williams denigrates their efforts by stating, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work,\u201d further confirms that she does not value the voices of black women or their resistance.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOdeleye considers the slight a plus, telling The Glow Up:\n\nBy bringing up the #MuteRKelly discussion on the national stage, Wendy Williams helped spread the message that there are black women nationwide standing united to end the sexual, physical and mental abuse of our young black women. . .Wherever R. Kelly is performing, we\u2019ll be there. We won\u2019t rest until we have, at the very least, ended his career. We are working with the victims, victims\u2019 families and attorneys to bring yet another criminal case against him. We plan to be a needle in his side until he\u2019s in the poor house, a mental facility or a jail cell.\n\nTarana Burke, founder of the Me Too movement, also feels that Kelly\u2019s time is up and that he should not be \u201cconveniently\u201d left out of conversations on sexual assault, especially among black women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlack women are just as vocal about giving R. Kelly a chance. I\u2019ve seen Facebook statuses that say, \u2018I don\u2019t care who [R. Kelly] is fucking, I\u2019m going to see him tonight\u2014I\u2019m buying my ticket,\u2019\u201d Burke stated in a phone interview with The Glow Up.\n\nThe Me Too movement founded by Burke in 2006 is not be confused with the latest #MeToo movement tied to the sexual harassment and rape of women in Hollywood. Although the two intersect today, initially they did not. Burke\u2019s movement was specifically started for underserved black girls from low-income communities who were sexually victimized and in need of supportive healing.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Burke responded to Williams\u2019 inflammatory comments:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSexual violence knows no race, color, class or gender, but the response to sexual violence does,\u201d Burke said in our interview. \u201cThe response to sexual violence is highly gendered and highly racialized and definitely defined by class.\u201d\n\nYeah, that part.\n\nIt is this nuance that allows R. Kelly to get off scot-free. Williams is reckless and clearly driven by her black female antagonism in not making these distinctions. That Williams (and black women of the same ilk) can afford to be so \u201csick of\u201d #MeToo is really quite disconcerting. In the same vein as Kelly, she is both a trigger and the gun, busting shots at black women, exploiting them and denying their humanity. Like R. Kelly, Wendy is out here wildin\u2019, and she, too, needs to be put on mute.", "keywords": ["muterkelly", "r", "wildin", "williams", "black", "assault", "sexual", "wendy", "women", "metoo", "comes", "girls", "twisted", "kelly", "young"], "polarity": 0.01676189520560382, "subjectivity": 0.48182343778370257},

But only a brief year before, a judge had ruled against pop star Kesha in her own exhaustive sexual abuse trial in favor of Sony Music and her alleged abuser, producer Dr. Luke.\n\nIn this watershed moment, what would the music industry have to offer when its own moment of reckoning has so far seemed muted, at best? This was the concern shared by Voices in Entertainment, a grassroots group initiated by female music execs concerned that the movement wasn\u2019t effectively reaching the music industry. Their first initiative? An email encouraging Grammy Awards attendees to wear white roses, in what would hopefully become the music industry\u2019s version of the #TimesUp blackout on the Golden Globes red carpet.\n\nBut while there were many white roses and #TimesUp pins among the designer finery on the Grammys red carpet, the most powerful moment of the night would be onstage. During her introduction of what would be an emotional performance by Kesha, musician and actress Janelle Mon\u00e1e gave a compelling speech, reminding the audience assembled at New York City\u2019s Madison Square Garden and abroad:\n\nTonight, I am proud to stand in solidarity as not just an artist, but a young woman, with my fellow sisters in this room who make up the music industry. Artists, writers, assistants, publicists, CEOs, producers, engineers and women from all sectors of the business. We are also daughters, wives, mothers, sisters and human beings. We come in peace, but we mean business. And to those who would dare try to silence us, we offer you two words: Time\u2019s up.

After rolling my eyes so hard they could be on a river, I decided to take a gander.\n\nIn the article, several industry players dropped their commentary around a reportedly growing fear that sexy or erotic films will become a thing of the past unless they have a \u201cfeminist\u201d spin.\n\nAside from agreeing that audiences may be less tolerant of explicit sex in films, I couldn\u2019t help noticing the sheer avoidance of the rape-culture-colored elephant in the room. One particular quote that expressed a sentiment I was ... expecting, to tell the truth, stood out. It was from entertainment attorney Mark Simon: \u201cThere may be a concern in this zero tolerance climate that creativity and creative opportunity could be restrained because individuals may become unwilling to put themselves in situations that could be misinterpreted or misconstrued in the creative process.\u201d\n\n*Rubs temples.* OK ...\n\nThe skittishness surrounding whether or not films can be produced with sex scenes really reeks of cishet men whining about, \u201cCAN WE EVEN COMPLIMENT Y\u2019ALL EVER?? DAMN!\u201d whenever women lament about sexual harassment. They can\u2019t fathom the fact that a compliment doesn\u2019t entitle them to a damn thing\u2014nope, not even a smile\u2014because they can\u2019t hear any actual logical thoughts around the tantrums thrown atop their IKEA \u201cTocksick Masculinitee\u201d Booster Seat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: Workplace sexual harassment and assault happen all up and through every single industry, so it has less to do with actors not being able to control their hormones while re-enacting sex scenes and more to do with the need to focus on creating a safe work environment, period. Novel idea!!\n\nAnyone who has ever been on a set knows that producing sex scenes is, in fact, not sexy. The blaring set lights are searing into the actors\u2019 skin as they try to remember their blocking while simultaneously attempting to ignore the critical gaze of the director, cinematographer, production assistants, grips, gaffers and a partridge in a pear tree. Very, very awkward and\u2014I repeat\u2014not sexy. However, it is up to the director to create a safe space that elicits the most vulnerable and impassioned portrayals from their actors. It\u2019s not only good for the product; it\u2019s good for the person.\n\nEven as someone fully ingrained in climbing the ladder toward Hollywood success, I still can\u2019t wrap my head around the idea that my priority should be concern for whether creativity will be stifled, just because masculinity is that fucking fragile. When I think about the #MeToo movement, I don\u2019t think about whether or not Hollywood will continue to be \u201csexy.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think about a female former co-worker who was subject to advances to join a high-level attorney in his hotel room during a corporate holiday party. I think about Danielle Young\u2019s strained smile standing next to Jesse Jackson, an image that has been etched into my brain forever, especially because I recognize it.\n\nI think about the woman who chose to be nice to a passerby on the street who endlessly flirted with her and followed her home, and who had to grapple with the fact that if she had chosen to be \u201cstandoffish and cold,\u201d it could\u2019ve cost her her life. I think about the little girl who first noticed her hips and thighs because an old man creepily grunted under his breath while peering through her pants. And I think about how I have to look at that girl in the mirror every day.\n\nEliminating or avoiding sex culture in Hollywood is only placing a Sexy Snoopy Band-Aid on the issue. What is the action plan here? Make only G-rated films until the trendiness of #MeToo dies down? Extreme reactions like the quote from the attorney above are why I become cynical regarding everyone\u2019s dedication to the true betterment of our society. We all know that the real work begins when we have to actually reinforce a healthy sex culture. Don\u2019t worry; we can keep the sexy. Sexy ain\u2019t the issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, I happen to think that consent is sexy as fuck. Hell, let\u2019s level that up: Enthusiastic consent is sexy as fuck.

I, at least, understood that he wanted to touch my leg and, likely, my pussy\u2014and ole boy understood that he could.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where dudes get it twisted.\n\nMany men presume that it is OK to project onto women their sexual impulses and violence in physical ways. And patriarchy is mostly to blame.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this week\u2019s episode of patriarchal fuckery, actor-comedian Aziz Ansari was accused of hypersexual insensitivity. A now exhaustively debated expos\u00e9 published by online magazine Babe tells the story of an anonymous woman, given the pseudonym Grace, who claims to have found herself in a compromising position with the entertainer.\n\nAllegedly, after a speedy dinner date, the 22-year-old woman accompanied Ansari to his apartment and engaged in mutual oral sex with him, after being \u201cclawed,\u201d fingered and pounced upon\u2014and even after \u201cgetting up and moving and him following and sticking his fingers down [her] throat again.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy her own admission, Grace acquiesced to sexual activity with Ansari, although she also acknowledges that she did not want to. The nature of what occurred between the two might not constitute sexual assault, but it puts the focus on fundamental glitches in modern dating and the normality of sexual misconduct.\n\nAnsari quickly issued a statement emphatically stating that \u201cby all indications [the encounter] was completely consensual,\u201d likely because everything appeared OK to him. He does not readily recognize his overtures as inappropriate. His claim absolves him of any intent to cause harm\u2014yet, by default, Grace is left to blame for her own distress.\n\nA male acquaintance of mine who has asked to remain anonymous stated, \u201cI would think that while the man is bearing all of the responsibility, she as a woman of agency and nonambiguity should advocate for herself and do what she has to in order to not let more bad happen.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an on-air attack, Wendy Williams blasted Grace: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just bite it and leave? \u2026 Why didn\u2019t you just grab your coat and leave, dummy?\u201d Williams asked scornfully.\n\nPerhaps they are all missing the point. Perhaps she liked him enough to renege on her usual self-standards. Perhaps she thought they\u2019d make a good couple with beautiful babies. Perhaps she was a groupie. Who knows? What we do know is that Grace was physically violated well before she took a position, well before she was browbeaten into giving a blow job and well before she gave in. Much like what happened in my situation, the point of consent was bypassed. None was given, but even worse, none was sought. It was a non-muthafuckin-factor.\n\nPeople must ask themselves why consent and communication are such an inconvenience.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe must also ask why we continue to court a tradition in which boys will be boys and men will be men, no matter their indiscretions, while women are held to a five-star standard of awareness, action and responsibility. We are centuries invested in men\u2019s entitlement and audacity, and their retarded understanding of and disrespect for women\u2019s bodily rights. We live in a society where patriarchy is well-established and chronically practiced.\n\nAuthor Kiese Laymon, a professor of English and African-American studies at the University of Mississippi, asserted this idea in an interview:\n\nThe nation encourages boys and men to \u201cget\u201d sex from women by any means necessary. We are trained to believe \u201cno\u201d means \u201cnot yet.\u201d And most of all, we are also trained not to care [for] or respect the millions of women who have taught us that consent is integral to healthy sex. We allow ourselves to be trained by patriarchy and not radical black feminism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile many people are adamant about the conjecture that Grace should have acted differently, several publications\u2014particularly The Guardian and The New York Times\u2014ran pieces that also accused Grace of undermining the #MeToo movement and lamenting a failed come up. Scores of social media users have questioned her choice to perform and receive head\u2014and then still call foul.\n\nFar too many conflate Grace\u2019s actions with permission, but that is a function of patriarchy. Giving in is not synonymous with giving consent\u2014although sometimes it is entirely necessary. Being a black woman, in particular, has its cost. According to the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research, black women are affected by violence\u2014physical and sexual\u2014at a much higher rate than women of other races. Navigating common spaces as a black woman informs me that speaking up and taking agency is not always in my best interest. Revisiting my own situation proved this.\n\nMy date that long-ago night was amused by my subtle rejection. He thought I was being coy. He drove to the nearest Holiday Inn, parked, checked in, then returned for me, hotel key in hand. I finally found the words: \u201cNah, I\u2019m good.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo his surprise, I rebuffed his expectation. To my surprise, his demeanor changed; his jawbone stiffened and he shut down. He drove off. We rode along a vacant Queens Boulevard in a thick silence. \u201cYou good?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s bitches like you that always shit on a good nigga that treats her right, but give ain\u2019t-shit niggas the pussy.\u201d\n\nI asked to be let out of the car. He refused. At a red light, I opened the car door and let myself out\u2014he got out, too. He followed me, apologized and insisted that I stop being dramatic and get back in the car. I refused. He hauled back and slapped the shit out of me. His handprint was pressed into the side of my face\u2014literally. He rescued my body from the ground and whispered, \u201cGet the fuck in the car and don\u2019t say a word, before this shit gets worse.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI got back into the car. He drove back to the hotel. He fucked me. I did not utter a word, and neither did he. What wasn\u2019t said was thoroughly communicated.\n\nContrary to popular opinion, women can remain silent or vocal, stay put or take flight, hold out or put out, and still get screwed. Many times, our decision to do so boils down to matters of life or death, or both. Despite what Wendy Williams proclaims, it is far from easy to bite a man\u2019s penis and flee from the scene without bodily harm. Yet with all things considered, women are still culpable for placing themselves in bad situations\u2014men, not so much. That is patriarchy at work.\n\nThis worldview, this flawed attitude, is due for serious change. Pushing the narrative of consent and communication is not about an indictment of \u201call men\u201d but, rather, about the predatory practice of too many. Consent isn\u2019t about suppressing sexual energy; it\u2019s about respecting a woman\u2019s right to sexually engage on her terms. Communication cannot rest solely on a set of cues. And the work cannot be left solely to women and the #MeToo movement. The responsibility rests upon all of our shoulders, especially those of men.

Confronting a man who almost killed your wife and child isn\u2019t the same as confronting the guy who made a throwaway joke about a situation you caused. The latent point, however, is that they both exist on the same spectrum of justifiable responses to disrespect, just on different ends of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey do not.\n\nLook, as anyone who has ever been in a committed romantic relationship knows, sometimes adversity happens. Sometimes it\u2019s external, and sometimes it\u2019s caused by the actions of one (or both) of the people in the relationship. Shit happens, and how you choose to deal with it is up to you as a couple.\n\nBut when that self-induced adversity hits and you decide to share it with the public\u2014whether on TV or radio or in a status message or a tweet\u2014people might form opinions. People might have commentary. People might make jokes. People might take sides. People might decide to just not fuck with you anymore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNaturally, if this happens, you might be in your feelings. Especially if you\u2019ve worked past the adversity. (Or at least you\u2019re telling people you have.) And this is your right! Feelings are good! Yay, feelings! But you\u2019re no longer on the justifiable-response spectrum. You jumped off of it when you decided to give everyone a snapshot of your mess, inviting us into what you now wish was private, and now you just have to swallow those feelings or maybe take a spa day or something.

Some of the stories shared through the #MeToo movement have triggered a range of emotions and questions; some may have come off as \u201cgray areas.\u201d How do we actually know when we\u2019re giving or given consent?\n\nSo glad you asked. Sexual consent is when both parties agree to have sex\u2014throughout the encounter. Let\u2019s start with the basics\u2014we\u2019ll call it \u201cConsent 101\u201d\u2014and then explore some less orthodox situations:\n\n\n\nDo I Really Need to Hear a \u201cYes\u201d?\n\nWell, yeah. You do. Hearing \u201cyes\u201d from your partner is\u2014and should be\u2014sexy as fuck. Speaking personally, nothing turns me on more than a partner who respects my wishes and wants to know my needs. When the chemistry is there, then ask questions like, \u201cIs it OK to touch ___?\u201d or \u201cDo you mind if I ___?\u201d Some people might consider this a mood killer, but guess what? Jail time and being heavily judged by your peers as a rapist are definite libido killers.\n\nIf You\u2019re Not Sure, Question It\u2014and Actually Get a Confirmation\n\nThey didn\u2019t say no, but they didn\u2019t say yes, either. Again: You NEED confirmation from your partner. To assume is making an ass out of you and me; so take away the doubt and question it. And don\u2019t stop there\u2014actually get a solid answer. Most times, body language can tell you a lot, even without words. If your partner is getting tense, ask again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsent Isn\u2019t Only Given by a Woman\n\nAllow me to burst a few bubbles: Consent isn\u2019t something that\u2019s gender-specific. If you think women are exempt from being sexual predators, think again. And if you think men are excluded from being victims, you\u2019re delusional.\n\nHere are some alarming statistics: According to the Connecticut Alliance to End Sexual Assault, 1 in 6 men will be sexually assaulted in their lifetimes\u2014and 1 in 4 of those victims are under the age of 12. These statistics are not mentioned to make women feel that their issues don\u2019t matter, but we need to acknowledge that men can be affected by sexual trauma, too. And we definitely cannot exclude the transgender, genderqueer or nonconforming populace from the conversation\u2014a 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey (pdf) found that 47 percent of transgender people are assaulted in their lifetimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing the Same Sex Doesn\u2019t Give You a Hall Pass\n\nFrom personal experience, I\u2019ve lost count of how many women I\u2019ve had to check for attempting to disrespect my personal space. As a bisexual woman who owns her sexuality, I\u2019ve found that some people fetishize my sexual orientation.\n\nOne night, while barhopping with friends, a plus-one from our outing put her hand on my breasts. Startled, I jumped back and immediately questioned her motives. Despite expressing how her repulsive actions made me feel, she instantly dismissed my feelings, suggesting that I \u201cget over it.\u201d She even pointed to my vagina, to imply that we have the same body parts. It ruined my night, and thankfully, others no longer felt comfortable bringing her to future functions. Violation of anyone\u2019s personal space, same sex or not, is wrong\u2014on a moral and legal level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsent for One Thing Doesn\u2019t Mean Everything Is Covered\n\nJust because I agreed to one sexual act doesn\u2019t mean I consent to do other things. Also, what\u2019s comfortable today may not serve as a kink tomorrow. Frankly, we can be in bed together in the buff, and it doesn\u2019t warrant that we proceed any further than cuddling. If you can\u2019t handle that, state your boundaries up front, too.\n\nAnd While We\u2019re at It, I Can Stop at Any Time\n\nHold tight to your barf bag, boys and girls, because there are plenty of people who believe that if you start, both parties are obligated to finish the act. I don\u2019t care if you are five minutes away from climaxing; when I say stop, it means STOP. And it doesn\u2019t make me a prude or selfish; no simply means no. If there\u2019s even a possibility that your partner may want to slow down or is having second thoughts, with or without explanations, respect their wishes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in the BDSM World, No May Mean Yes\n\nDespite the stereotypes, BDSM is a lot more than just whips and chains. It is heavily dependent on trust in your partner. For those unfamiliar with the abbreviation, it\u2019s broken down into bondage, discipline/dominance, submission/sadism and masochism. As a \u201cswitch,\u201d I learned quickly about the importance of safe words when engaging in sexual activities with partners. Prior to the act, you should truly know your partner\u2019s desires and dislikes.\n\nMost important, establish safe words and touches and understand their body language. Without this discussion, things can go terribly wrong fairly quickly. Because words such as \u201cno\u201d and \u201cstop\u201d can be viewed as \u201cyes\u201d in the submissive and domination community, these terms are typically avoided as cues to stop during the act. Words like \u201cred,\u201d \u201cyellow\u201d and \u201cgreen\u201d\u2014reminiscent of traffic lights\u2014are great word selections. Know the difference between BDSM play and assault.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust a Thought: Avoid Vulnerable Partners\n\nAs an FYI, a heavily inebriated or exceptionally high partner cannot reliably give you consent. If your partner isn\u2019t coherent and you perform sexual acts with this person, this can later be considered equivalent to rape. Alcohol and drugs can impair someone\u2019s judgment severely. If the connection is truly there, ask and wait for validation when the other person is sober.\n\n\n\nIf They\u2019re Not of Legal Age, Guess What?\n\nDo I have to mention that minors also aren\u2019t legally allowed to consent to sexual relations with an adult? On that note: Parents should consider having conversations with teens before they enter junior high school. On average, Americans lose their virginity at 17 years old, but they are experimenting far earlier, so it\u2019s worth gradually sparking conversations about sex, protection and consent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParents: Don\u2019t view it as giving your children permission to lose their virginity, but more about their safety. Sexual education in school is on the decline, and caretakers should feel comfortable taking the responsibility to answer questions that their children may or may not have considered.\n\nRape and Sexual Harassment Are NOT Your Fault\n\nAbove all, know that you didn\u2019t ask for it. Rape and sexual harassment are not your fault. If you were raped or are uncertain whether you were sexually assaulted, please don\u2019t hesitate to seek assistance from organizations like RAINN, which will connect you to support groups or a talk therapist. Reach out to local authorities if you ever feel unsafe from a sexual predator. Know that you\u2019re not alone and that there are a host of places willing to help you through your trauma.

Leveraging their popular podcast into TV stardom, \u201cthe Bodega Boys\u201d riff on popular culture, politics and (mostly) white people. They\u2019ve become the popular destination for the coolest guests because their show is basically The Daily Show if Trevor Noah were a pair of weed-smoking, 40-ounce-drinking dudes from the Bronx, N.Y..\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bodega Boys\u2019 beef with DJ Envy began when text messages surfaced of DJ Envy (who is married) chatting with someone who suggested butt play with the Power 105.1 FM host. As usual, Desus and Mero became the hood version of CNN, exposing the story:\n\nThe dispute continued when DJ Envy appeared on an episode of The Real with his wife, seemingly trying to contain the damage. The couple were very honest about the radio host\u2019s past indiscretions, making it appear that they had fixed all of their problems. Desus and Mero, who never shy away from controversy, made fun of the appearance by Envy and his wife because ... well, that\u2019s what they do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, on Thursday morning, Desus and Mero appeared on The Breakfast Club. Envy was in his feelings from the time the men walked in, and there was nothing wrong with that except the men didn\u2019t realize there was a beef.\n\n\n\nAfter introducing his guests as \u201cDickhead\u201d and \u201cPussy,\u201d which is mad passive-aggressive and totally light-skinned, Envy began to explain the impetus behind his beige rage. (Oh, did I mention that Envy was sporting a \u201cMy God vs. My Enemies\u201d hat, which was totally planned because isn\u2019t it just like a light-skinned man to wear passive-aggressive clothing to a fuss fight?)\n\n\u201cYou owe my wife an apology,\u201d Envy said to a baffled Desus and Mero. \u201cWhen you insinuated that she was there for the check.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen DJ Envy played the clip in which Desus and Mero totally insinuated that Envy\u2019s wife was sticking around for the check. Envy wasn\u2019t going full light-skinned for being mad about that. It was a low blow for the talk show guests to take shots at Envy\u2019s wife. Envy explained that wives and children were off-limits, and the guests agreed and apologized.\n\nWhere Envy drove his Jeep Grand Cherokee off the road (yes, Jeep Grand Cherokees are the preferred cars of light-skinned men; just ask any Kappa) was when he couldn\u2019t let it go. He literally stewed in his anger like a spoiled child unable to accept that he\u2019d actually gotten his way. Not sure if Envy came into work looking for a fight, but what he found was an apology, and that wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nEnvy proceeded to hard-chew his gum (totally light-skinned and passive-aggressive), and make snide remarks before he went full Sinbad and walked off the show, undoing all of Matt Barnes\u2019 good work to dispel the myth that light-skinned men will walk off the air.\n\nAt that point, if Envy was still upset, he should\u2019ve reached across the table and taken a swing at Desus (because Mero is heavier; Dominican\u2014which means there is a 62 percent chance he had a razor under his tongue; and because I\u2019m not here for light-skinned-on-light-skinned crime).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know, because that is what rapper Casanova 2x would\u2019ve done. He is my spiritual guide whenever I\u2019m trying to sort out whether or not I\u2019m inside my light-skinned bag. I can\u2019t see Casanova 2x pushing the microphone away and storming out of the interview after receiving an apology, if for no other reason than he made this song and you can\u2019t get passive-aggressive after rhyming that you would punch someone\u2019s teeth out.\n\nMy sources tell me that Envy walked off the air and into his office, where he took a few swings at the air and then curled up on the floor in the fetal position and had a good cry, and it was well-earned. (And by \u201csources,\u201d I mean my imagination, which is definitely a source.)\n\nEnvy wasn\u2019t wrong for sticking up for his wife\u2019s honor. That\u2019s the commendable part of what he did. Hell, owning up to his cheating on national radio and national television is a real look at grown-man shit.

What\u2019s currently prevalent in the pieces responding to Babe\u2019s Ansari story are hyperbole, intellectual dishonesty and red herrings.\n\nIn her response to Babe\u2019s article, \u201cAziz Ansari Is Guilty. Of Not Being a Mind Reader,\u201d the New York Times\u2019 Bari Weiss shrieks, \u201cThe insidious attempts by some women to criminalize awkward, gross, and entitled sex takes women back to the days of smelling salts, and fainting couches.\u201d The Los Angeles Times, unafraid to ask the \u201ctough\u201d questions, pondered, \u201cIs Aziz Ansari a Victim or Perpetrator?\u201d\n\nNot to be outdone in the histrionics competition, The Atlantic published \u201cThe Humiliation of Aziz Ansari,\u201d in which writer Caitlin Flanagan calls Babe\u2019s piece \u201c3,000 words of revenge porn\u201d and eagerly paints \u201cGrace\u201d as a nefarious, resentful, mean girl hell-bent on making Ansari pay for rejecting her, declaring, \u201cTogether, [Grace and Babe writer Katie Way] may have destroyed Ansari\u2019s career.\u201d\n\nIronically, the same parties who stress the necessity of having stringent qualifications for proper claims of sexual assault and victimhood\u2014of which they deem Grace unworthy\u2014have less demanding standards of proof when it comes to bestowing Ansari with their own thorny crowns of victimization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir flimsy concern about \u201cinfantilizing\u201d women is nothing short of laughable as they indulge in their anti-fourth-wave-feminism hysterics and pull a 34-year-old man to their heaving bosoms like vigilant caretakers, rendering him incapable of anything more malignant than simply being a creepy and inattentive sexual partner.\n\nReality is much less fantastical. Babe\u2019s piece, flawed as it may be, did not send society as we know it into a tailspin of anomie. Scores of hapless men who merely attempt conversation or interaction with women who pique their sexual interest are not being apprehended by a feminist gestapo for crimes of rape; nor did it \u201cderail\u201d the #MeToo movement for parties who weren\u2019t already looking for an excuse to dismiss it.\n\nWe do not live in a society where published allegations of sexual assault alone ruin one\u2019s career. If it\u2019s any consolation for the Weisses and Flanagans of the world, they may simply look to the likes of R. Kelly and the current president of the United States for solace in how little such accusations hinder powerful men from thriving.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo date, Ansari\u2014much like most of the celebrities and industry insiders who have recently been accused of assault and misconduct\u2014has not been destroyed by modern-day, bloodthirsty-feminist witch hunts, excommunicated from human civilization or criminalized (pending police investigations into allegations involving Harvey Weinstein and Russell Simmons notwithstanding).\n\n\n\nGrace\u2019s account\u2014one that toggles between acquiescing to certain sexual acts and withdrawing from others\u2014is a pervasive experience. While many seem to direct their ire at Grace for her decisions and at Babe for its treatment of the story, few are expressing resentment toward the societal conditions that demand we present infallible victims with accounts of sexual abuse enshrouded in an impenetrable armor of credibility to even be taken seriously in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s time to be honest: We are a society\u2014a country especially\u2014that despises victims for having the audacity to \u201callow\u201d themselves to be victimized. When Grace describes her reaction to Ansari\u2019s advances\u2014\u201cI stopped moving my lips and went cold\u201d\u2014it was hard for me to imagine that many of us couldn\u2019t relate to that kind of dissociation. When she mentions taking a while to concede to the feeling that she\u2019d been violated, I understood her reluctance to arrive there.\n\n\n\nVictimhood is work. Acknowledging it, vocalizing it, deciding if it merits pressing charges, following through with seeking punitive recourse or any recourse, healing from it, moving on and preparing for the onslaught of interrogation from parties who are more than eager to discredit it\u2014it\u2019s arduous and painful work.\n\nThe choice to \u201cfight back\u201d when you are being pressured or overpowered during sexual interaction makes it all the more real that an assault is happening and could escalate, and the consequential stigma of victimhood all the more imminent. It\u2019s no wonder so many people resent it and try to deny their own proximity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFew sins are worse in America than being powerless. Many of us, especially those of us who may have already cobbled ourselves together after recovering from prior experiences with assault, would rather dissociate and delude ourselves into believing that our own experiences with sexual coercion were just \u201caggressive\u201d or \u201cawkward\u201d instances that we gave into\u2014to avoid having to add another instance of sexual assault to an already loaded plate of trauma.\n\nThe takeaway from Grace\u2019s anecdote isn\u2019t that we should consider every regrettable or uncomfortable sexual interaction as assault (though this anecdote described more than mere discomfort; remember, sexual assault encompasses more than rape). This isn\u2019t about bad sex. It\u2019s about examining how dysfunctional our sexual socialization is for us to read that instance and chalk it up to merely being a \u201cnormal\u201d and clumsy sexual experience. There should be nothing \u201cnormal\u201d about leaving a date in tears because you feel violated, and we shouldn\u2019t be so content and flippant with characterizing it as such.\n\n\n\nUltimately, this is an incident in which many truths can exist; we can acknowledge that it\u2019s probable Ansari\u2019s celebrity and his public persona played a part in Grace wanting to give Ansari a chance to redeem himself during that evening, and even desiring his kindness after he made her uncomfortable. It\u2019s just as probable that Ansari was fully aware of the leverage his celebrity granted him over a green young woman 10 years his junior who was visibly eager to go out on a date with a popular star.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also very likely that a man who has written a book about modern dating in which he elaborates on his habit of determining if a woman is uninterested in him simply by the tone and response time of her text messages is capable of gauging that a woman who recoils from his attempts of getting her to touch his dick for 30 minutes and verbally expresses that she doesn\u2019t \u201cwant to feel forced\u201d is probably not excited about having sex with him, and consent is not static.\n\nFurthermore, claims that men in general are unable to read nonverbal cues and that anything other than a clear \u201cno\u201d confuses them have been debunked in recent studies; researchers conclude (pdf) that men are, in fact, perfectly capable of reading and recognizing nonverbal cues from women who are resistant to sex. The problem isn\u2019t that they don\u2019t understand; they just don\u2019t like the answer.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s OK to feel unsure if what Grace described as the worst night of her life neatly matches with your understanding of assault. That discussion needs to be had if we are to have a rigorous examination of our sexual politics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, accusations of sexual abuse are not all going to look like scandalous, easy-to-condemn, jaw-dropping accounts of egregious brutality and predation, and alleged victims are not always going to behave in ways we understand. Nor should they have to for us to engage them responsibly.\n\nDisingenuous, lazy claims about the \u201cambiguity\u201d of both consent and resistance allow sexual assault to remain ubiquitous. If nothing else, we are a society that firmly believes in questioning the credibility of alleged victims with way more fervor than we do the actions of their alleged abusers.\n\nWe have ample leg room to, instead, fix our gaze on proper ways to handle the stories and best interest of people alleging sexual assault. We can also stand to focus a harsher lens on men like Ansari who pursue rigid sexual compliance in the face of resistance and to admonish their team of toxic acolytes who are more than eager to dismiss their harmfulness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we are to push forward conversations about sexual abuse and all of its variations, we need to be prepared to be uncomfortable, unsure and conflicted. It\u2019s not a precursor to anarchy or a disservice to the movement if we question what we have accepted to be normal and entertain the possibility that we have been harmed or may have also caused harm during the course of our sexual experiences.\n\nRest assured, we have not strayed that far from the status quo.

Nudity doesn\u2019t have to be sexual.\u2019 If we asked questions or hesitated, we were the ones making it weird,\u201d Kim added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe women said that once they were lured into the hot tub, Vereen asked them personal questions.\n\n\u201cHe was acting as my mentor, asking me about my parents; then that same night, he put me on his lap while I was crying, and I felt his erection,\u201d Terpstra recalled.\n\n\u201cHe asked me, \u2018Feel that?\u2019 It was terrifying. I said, \u2018Feel what?\u2019 I wanted to act like I didn\u2019t. I pushed myself off with a laugh. Then later, he asked, \u2018Do you think I want to fuck you?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yes,\u2019 and he got angry. He said, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t, and that\u2019s unfortunate.\u2019 He made me feel like I had my mind in the gutter.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKim said that while she was in the hot tub with Vereen, things went even further after he asked her to perform oral sex and left her feeling \u201cconfused.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just think at the time, I didn\u2019t feel like I had a choice. I didn\u2019t want to do it, but I was intimidated and scared. He was being very intense and angry. He seemed very angry and offended. I had seen him behave this way toward others in the tribe during circle,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI just felt powerless because I thought I really needed his help and guidance. And when he said nudity doesn\u2019t have to be sexual, I was like, \u2018OK, maybe this isn\u2019t even sexual,\u2019\u201d Kim added. \u201cNow I understand it was a power play. It was so calculated. It was like we were putty in his hands.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Daily News notes:\n\nIn his statement, Vereen said he gained new perspective on his behavior in the last two years. \u201cWhile it was my intention to create an environment that replicated the themes of that musical during the rehearsal process, I have since come to understand that it is my conduct, not my intentions, which are relevant here. So I am not going to make any excuses because the only thing that matters here is acknowledging and apologizing for the effects of my conduct on the lives of these women,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing forward, my having come to terms with my past conduct will inform all my future interactions not only with women, but with all individuals. I hope these women will find it in their hearts to accept my sincere apology and forgive me,\u201d his statement read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKim acknowledged that she eventually became involved in a relationship with Vereen, saying that she told herself it was more spiritual than sexual.\n\nAnother actress, Ariella Pizarro, accused Vereen of pressing himself against her one night as he hugged her goodbye, before later texting her, \u201cYo (sic) felt so good tonight.\u201d\n\nFrom the Daily News:\n\nThe News obtained a copy of the text message sent by Vereen and confirmed the number was listed in his name. Pizarro said Vereen also randomly kissed her on the lips in the first few weeks of rehearsals, when she was 22 years old. \u201cWe were in a music rehearsal, and he was just walking around, and then he walked up and kissed me on the lips. It was so weird. We all knew Hair was going to be a different kind of production, like in the \u201960s, but he didn\u2019t even ask first. He just kissed me. I was shocked, for sure,\u201d Pizarro said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t shove his tongue down my throat, but it gave me an uneasy feeling. Then he moved on. I didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom that point on, I kept myself at arm\u2019s length with Ben.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCast members also recalled an uncomfortable moment when they had to strip for a rehearsal exercise and Vereen decided he would get naked, too.\n\n\u201cIt was uncomfortable, to say the least,\u201d Pizarro noted.\n\nAs for Venice Theatre, which was supposed to be watching out for these young women, officials said they only became fully aware of the extent of the allegations after Terpstra posted on Facebook about the experience back in November.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe theater reached out to every member of the Hair cast, getting in contact with all but six of the 32 individuals.\n\n\u201cWe have learned recently that during our 2015 production of Hair, more than one female cast member was asked to join Mr. Vereen at his residence. Some of those visits resulted in compromising situations for at least two of the actresses,\u201d Executive Director Murray Chase said in a statement. \u201cWe are working to strengthen our sexual harassment policies and procedures, including the reporting of them, to prevent any future occurrences.\u201d\n\nThat being said, Terpstra said that Chase had to step in during one particularly volatile confrontation with Vereen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Daily News reports:\n\nTerpstra said she\u2019s not sure exactly what she told [Chase], but she thinks she mentioned at least one forced kiss. She said Chase later sat in on the final dress rehearsal, but Vereen was not banned from the building. Chase told the News he remembered the hallway incident but thought it was isolated. \u201cWhile we were aware of an altercation between Ben Vereen and Ms. Terpstra, we have now learned of additional situations,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth Terpstra and Kim said that the experience with Vereen had lasting effects on their careers, with neither having acted in a production since, although both have stayed in the creative fields, with Terpstra going toward burlesque, while Kim returned to a job at the Venice Theatre to \u201credefine that space.\u201d", "keywords": ["assaulting", "production", "feel", "actresses", "vereen", "sexually", "broadway", "didnt", "daily", "hair", "asked", "women", "sexual", "star", "terpstra", "ben", "young"], "polarity": 0.029034894398530763, "subjectivity": 0.4628856749311295},

Kelly\u2019s music on the list of things black people say they\u2019re boycotting but still support on the down low (because, as the great pedophile purveyor of pee-pee once sang: \u201cNobody has to knoooow\u201d).\n\nMo\u2019 evoked her age, her award r\u00e9sum\u00e9, her status as a legend, the history of black women and even the civil rights struggle in her well-laid-out argument on why she considered CandyCorn Face tha God\u2019s use of \u201cdonkey\u201d disrespectful. She, unfortunately, dismantled her logic-based assertions every time she publicly referred to her husband-manager (who was on the phone) as \u201cDaddy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharlamagne tha Lawd listened intently and presented his own reasons for why he felt she deserved to be called a \u201cdonkey\u201d for overvaluing her worth as a celebrity and boycott kickstarter. The entire exchange was compelling, and both sides came away from it looking simultaneously petulant and convincing in the disagreement.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. Maybe they were both right.\n\nCharlamagne talks on the radio for a living. Besides providing a platform for Negro-hating white women, and calibrating his disdain for black women based on the amount of melanin in their skin (to be fair, long before he dismissed Amara La Negra\u2019s colorism claims, Charlamagne tha Goddamn Fool explained that \u201cwhite girls are poppin\u2019 right now\u201d), his primary job is as a shade thrower and shit starter. He does it well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo his credit, Charlie was willing to face his critics, and anything he said in their absence, he will say in their presence\u2014most famously to Birdman, who forever blessed us with a never-expiring meme when the Cash Money millionaire implored Charlamagne tha Bomb Pop face to \u201cput some respeck\u201d on his name.\n\nRegardless of my feelings about Charlamagne, some people respeck him for that. In his hometown of Moncks Corner, S.C. (the home of my mother), that is the law. You can say anything about anyone, as long as you are willing to say it to their face. He tried to explain why he called Mo\u2019Nique a donkey while she was present.\n\nAnd even though Charlamagne tha Messiah is often problematic, he didn\u2019t run. Like Erik Killmonger and people who can\u2019t stop themselves from dancing to the remix to \u201cIgnition,\u201d he handled it the wrong way, which she told him in private, after the mics were off:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever you feel about Mo\u2019Nique, it is impossible to deny her credentials. She is one of the few black female comedians to have ever entered the stratosphere of the top echelon of joke tellers\u2014black or white. Lest we forget, she has a little thing I like to call an \u201cAcademy Award.\u201d\n\n\n\nHer dispute with Netflix aside, one cannot reach the levels of success that she has achieved without talent and hard work. Her unwillingness to accept an offer that she feels devalues her as a performer and a human being shouldn\u2019t be dismissed in the equation. Whether or not anyone else feels she has overestimated her value is inconsequential.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish I had Mo\u2019Nique\u2019s level of confidence and self-value. The idea that others cannot determine the value of your work is an important lesson. Maybe she should treat people better. Maybe she isn\u2019t as funny or as popular as she and her \u201cDaddy\u201d believes (I feel like I should put my name on the sex offender\u2019s registry every time I type that), but her willingness to say \u201cFuck your couch\u201d and stand on principle is admirable.\n\nMo\u2019Nique is right. Black is often devalued because it is black. Women are often lowballed because they are women. It is difficult to live in that reality and reject it as a reason that she believes Netflix undervalued her.

Women like Mary J. Blige have revealed that they were molested at 5 years old and throughout their adolescence.

That\u2019s right. Charges of abuse of at least 140 girls and young women went ignored and unnoticed for years. Young black women like Biles and Gabby Douglas, who\u2019ve made history on our television screens, were allegedly violated repeatedly by a person who was paid to ensure their health.

I love the Super Bowl. I love how we pretend that it truly matters in the grand scheme of things. I love the commercials and the halftime shows and all that jazz. I even love that Justin Timberlake\u2019s halftime show caught the same critical treatment as his album. Spoiler alert: They\u2019re both basura.\n\n\n\nAnyway, as I made my preparations (read: treated Super Bowl Sunday like any ol\u2019 Sunday), I decided I\u2019d spend the day watching movies. Early in the day, I watched Get Out. Then I watched Sleepers. This was all before the Super Bowl. Because I got some early movie watching in, I felt like I could do it with ease. Sure, I\u2019d miss the commercials that I love, but I mean, this is principle. I could do this.\n\nI pulled up my Netflix queue and watched Morris From America, which was a little bit like Get Out but with teenagers. It was also not funny and I only watched it because the description had Craig Robinson and hip-hop in it. That took me right into what would have been the first quarter, probably, of the Super Bowl. Once that wrapped and after searching for what seemed like forever, I landed on Message From the King, starring Chadwick Boseman. I think I watched a solid 2.5 minutes of that before ending up in a family discussion about wedding venues, love languages and what constitutes \u201ca drink.\u201d That conversation lasted way longer than it should have.\n\n\n\nAt about 8 p.m., my girl went upstairs and took my sons with her to put them to bed. I started scrolling through my Amazon Prime queue and then it happened: I got a phone alert letting me know that the Eagles were up 22 to 12 at halftime. And then I started itching.\n\nI hate the New England Patriots, possibly irrationally. I hate Tom Brady even though I respect him, Bill Belichick and the organization\u2019s winning ways. They\u2019re winners, and that\u2019s nice for them. But I don\u2019t ever want them to win shit ever again for eternity. Sadly, I felt like they\u2019d win this game. But something felt different about that halftime alert. I thought, \u201cCould it be?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI checked out the USA Today game breakdown, and between the two teams, they\u2019d amassed over 650 offensive yards\u2014I guess the defenses didn\u2019t feel like playing yesterday\u2014by halftime. I LOVE offensive contests. LOVE LOVE LOVE. And THIS is the Super Bowl I\u2019m missing? Le sigh.\n\nBut I held fast. I knew Timberlake was about to perform and hopefully shit the bed (success), and I mean, the Pats were probably gon\u2019 Pat (and make a comeback). But I couldn\u2019t shake the lingering feeling that maybe the Eagles could pull it out. I refused to watch the game, though. Instead, I kept attempting to watch what amounted to the shittiest list of bad black movies known to man.\n\nI started with Flowers. Literally made it one minute and was like, \u201cNope.\u201d Then I tried to watch Living With No Regrets because Clifton Powell was on the cover art. But that movie looked like it was filmed on a Razr EVEN THOUGH it came out in 2015. I should have known something was up when I kept seeing the name \u201cDoItAll Kelly\u201d pop up for every important role and function. Listen\u2014for all of those people who feel like there aren\u2019t enough black movies out there, that\u2019s not true. There are TONS. Most are just REALLY, REALLY, REALLY bad. I watch them all for you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt some point I started getting random text messages from people like, \u201cBruh ... you watching this?\u201d I ignored them. USA Today even kept sending me alerts ever so rudely. I caught a text about the Tide commercial, then about the one with Odell Beckham, Eli Manning and Dirty Dancing, which\u2014until I watched the commercial this morning\u2014might be in the top 10 most confusing texts messages I\u2019ve ever received in life and had me entirely wrapped up in the possibilities for at least seven minutes. Though after I watched the commercial, it made so much sense. I, too, love that commercial.\n\nListen\u2014I managed to make it through the whole game without watching a single down, but you know how you can tell a game or event is getting better by the number of texts you start receiving from people who never text you or watch those games or events? That happened. I went from itching heavily while oddly watching PJ Masks\u2014it\u2019s a Disney show; I\u2019m not really sure how I ended up there\u2014to having an eye twitch. I picked up my remote control and then threw it under the couch. I lay down and put my face on a pillow on my couch, and the next thing I knew, I was being woken up by my woman yelling from upstairs asking if I was asleep.\n\nI\u2019ve always found that question odd. Anyway, that woke me up and I checked my phone and saw that the Eagles of Philadelphia had flown high. From USA Today: \u201cEagles dethrone Patriots 41-33 to win first Super Bowl in franchise history.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m not an Eagles fan, but I was so happy to see that alert. Like, for five minutes I felt like a bandwagon Eagles fan JUST because they beat the Patriots, and nothing makes me happier than Patriot losses in the Super Bowl. Remember\u2014I have an irrational hatred. So while I was happy that I didn\u2019t betray my protest and watch the Super Bowl, I REALLY wished I\u2019d seen that shit happen in real time so I could jump up and down and run around and shoot the bird to Tom Brady in hopes he\u2019d feel the supernatural force of my disdain through my television. I\u2019m proud of myself and happy that the Patriots lost. So I suppose it was a good night.\n\nAnd because it\u2019s Philadelphia, at 11:18 p.m., I received this alert from Bleacher Report: \u201cPhiladelphia is literally on fire after Eagles shock Patriots to win Super Bowl LII.\u201d\n\nAnd all was right with the world.", "keywords": ["heres", "successfully", "looked", "super", "halftime", "patriots", "didnt", "2018", "love", "watching", "watch", "watched", "struggle", "really", "bowl", "eagles"], "polarity": 0.11258361921097768, "subjectivity": 0.5437079011135614},

Leveraging their popular podcast into TV stardom, \u201cthe Bodega Boys\u201d riff on popular culture, politics and (mostly) white people. They\u2019ve become the popular destination for the coolest guests because their show is basically The Daily Show if Trevor Noah were a pair of weed-smoking, 40-ounce-drinking dudes from the Bronx, N.Y..\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bodega Boys\u2019 beef with DJ Envy began when text messages surfaced of DJ Envy (who is married) chatting with someone who suggested butt play with the Power 105.1 FM host. As usual, Desus and Mero became the hood version of CNN, exposing the story:\n\nThe dispute continued when DJ Envy appeared on an episode of The Real with his wife, seemingly trying to contain the damage. The couple were very honest about the radio host\u2019s past indiscretions, making it appear that they had fixed all of their problems. Desus and Mero, who never shy away from controversy, made fun of the appearance by Envy and his wife because ... well, that\u2019s what they do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, on Thursday morning, Desus and Mero appeared on The Breakfast Club. Envy was in his feelings from the time the men walked in, and there was nothing wrong with that except the men didn\u2019t realize there was a beef.\n\n\n\nAfter introducing his guests as \u201cDickhead\u201d and \u201cPussy,\u201d which is mad passive-aggressive and totally light-skinned, Envy began to explain the impetus behind his beige rage. (Oh, did I mention that Envy was sporting a \u201cMy God vs. My Enemies\u201d hat, which was totally planned because isn\u2019t it just like a light-skinned man to wear passive-aggressive clothing to a fuss fight?)\n\n\u201cYou owe my wife an apology,\u201d Envy said to a baffled Desus and Mero. \u201cWhen you insinuated that she was there for the check.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen DJ Envy played the clip in which Desus and Mero totally insinuated that Envy\u2019s wife was sticking around for the check. Envy wasn\u2019t going full light-skinned for being mad about that. It was a low blow for the talk show guests to take shots at Envy\u2019s wife. Envy explained that wives and children were off-limits, and the guests agreed and apologized.\n\nWhere Envy drove his Jeep Grand Cherokee off the road (yes, Jeep Grand Cherokees are the preferred cars of light-skinned men; just ask any Kappa) was when he couldn\u2019t let it go. He literally stewed in his anger like a spoiled child unable to accept that he\u2019d actually gotten his way. Not sure if Envy came into work looking for a fight, but what he found was an apology, and that wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nEnvy proceeded to hard-chew his gum (totally light-skinned and passive-aggressive), and make snide remarks before he went full Sinbad and walked off the show, undoing all of Matt Barnes\u2019 good work to dispel the myth that light-skinned men will walk off the air.\n\nAt that point, if Envy was still upset, he should\u2019ve reached across the table and taken a swing at Desus (because Mero is heavier; Dominican\u2014which means there is a 62 percent chance he had a razor under his tongue; and because I\u2019m not here for light-skinned-on-light-skinned crime).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know, because that is what rapper Casanova 2x would\u2019ve done. He is my spiritual guide whenever I\u2019m trying to sort out whether or not I\u2019m inside my light-skinned bag. I can\u2019t see Casanova 2x pushing the microphone away and storming out of the interview after receiving an apology, if for no other reason than he made this song and you can\u2019t get passive-aggressive after rhyming that you would punch someone\u2019s teeth out.\n\nMy sources tell me that Envy walked off the air and into his office, where he took a few swings at the air and then curled up on the floor in the fetal position and had a good cry, and it was well-earned. (And by \u201csources,\u201d I mean my imagination, which is definitely a source.)\n\nEnvy wasn\u2019t wrong for sticking up for his wife\u2019s honor. That\u2019s the commendable part of what he did. Hell, owning up to his cheating on national radio and national television is a real look at grown-man shit. But come on, bruh, Vin Diesel didn\u2019t threaten to beat up Dwayne \u201cthe Rock\u201d Johnson in real life for you to match your hat to your emotions.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is only one way that Envy can undo this: He\u2019s going to have to fight Charlamagne tha God in a caged death match or admit on the air that he went full light-skinned and then apologize to his guests.\n\nOr, maybe, to redeem his credentials and escape the official censure at the next meeting of #TeamLightSkinned, he can go on Desus and Mero\u2019s show as a guest and fight them both.\n\nWatch out for the razor, though.", "keywords": ["envys", "radio", "totally", "real", "dj", "passiveaggressive", "moment", "lightskinned", "history", "men", "desus", "walkoff", "envy", "wife", "tantrum", "mero"], "polarity": 0.09482704402515722, "subjectivity": 0.5569444444444446},

Weinstein had not only donated millions of dollars to the Democratic Party but had also hosted fundraisers that the Obamas attended. But the allegations hit particularly close to home for the Obamas because Malia had just wrapped up a coveted internship with the mogul\u2019s production company a few months ago.\n\nFrom CBS News:\n\nMichelle and I have been disgusted by the recent reports about Harvey Weinstein. Any man who demeans and degrades women in such fashion needs to be held accountable, regardless of wealth or status. We should celebrate the courage of women who come forward to tell these painful stories. And we all need to build a culture \u2014 including by empowering our girls and teaching our boys decency and respect \u2014 so we can make such behavior less prevalent in the future.\n\nMalia landed her internship with the Weinstein Co. earlier this year, working with the production and development department. Many have speculated about what the 19-year-old may have known about the Hollywood producer\u2019s alleged predatory behavior.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, actresses Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie joined the growing list of women who claim that Weinstein harassed or abused them.\n\nOne of the stronger condemnations of Hollywood\u2019s treatment of women came from Black Panther director Ryan Coogler. The director\u2019s debut, Fruitvale Station, about the death of Oscar Grant at the hands of a Bay Area Rapid Transit officer in 2009, was released by the Weinstein Co.\n\nShadow and Act released Coogler\u2019s statement in full. The acclaimed filmmaker said he was \u201cdisturbed and saddened\u201d by the news, adding that he was unaware of Weinstein\u2019s behavior but felt a responsibility to speak on the issue because of his connection to the producer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Coogler didn\u2019t stop there:\n\nI love working as a storyteller. But I work in an industry that too many times has proven to not be a safe space for women. I make it a priority to ensure that there is gender equity and an inclusive work environment on every project I am involved with. However, just minding our business sometimes isn\u2019t enough. It goes without saying, but I will state it now: sexual harassment is a human rights violation, sexual assault is a human rights violation, rape is a human rights violation. The entertainment industry, like many others, has a historic imbalance of power among gender that allows these violations to run rampant. As men we sit in positions of privilege. It is our responsibility to leverage our position, and be allies to the women in our industry. We need to do everything we can to make sure violations like these don\u2019t continue to happen. The first step is to listen. Salute to the brave women who came forward. I could never imagine how difficult that must be.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo his credit, Coogler has been walking the talk on gender inclusivity in Hollywood, unlike some of the actors and directors who have given lukewarm expressions of shock at the Weinstein allegations.\n\nThe scandal, long regarded as an \u201copen secret\u201d in Hollywood, according to some reports, has forced the entertainment industry to confront the ways it enables and reinforces systems of abuse and exploitation. The Weinstein story in particular has prompted many big names to come out about harassment they\u2019ve suffered. On Tuesday, former NFL player and comedic actor Terry Crews opened up about being groped at a party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHollywood is not the only business [where] this happens,\u201d Crews warned. \u201cAnd to the casualties of this behavior\u2014you are not alone.\u201d\n\nRead more at CBS News.", "keywords": ["rights", "obamas", "weinstein", "human", "hollywood", "industry", "harvey", "sexual", "women", "released", "say", "violation"], "polarity": 0.07222222222222222, "subjectivity": 0.46475308641975305},

It is a dangerous, albeit relatable, thought for many people who have experienced romantic love. Although I will not commit this thought to action, it tells me that toxic things are taking place in both my environment and the dynamic of my relationship. Thoughts are intangible, but they are far from inconsequential. It is thoughts that create presidencies and sustain toxic cultures.\n\nKeith Boykin recently wrote an article titled \u201cIn Defense of Lust\u201d as a response to an article by writer Darnell Moore titled \u201cThe Bodies of Others Are Not Mine.\u201d\n\nMoore wrote poetically about fundamental feminist truths around queer men and our objectification of one another. Moore interrogates his own habits when interacting with other men and invites gay men to do the same for themselves. The idea of his essay was to push and queer the conversation around rape culture past the heteronormative lens through which we\u2019ve been looking at it ever since the Hollywood sex scandals around Harvey Weinstein penetrated the public consciousness.\n\nBoykin\u2019s article challenges Moore\u2019s and states the case that thoughts can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be policed\u2014that as long as no action is being committed, there is no offense to apologize for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a post-The Secret world, it was surprising to read words, especially from a writer, that attempted to declaw the power of thought. Boykin writes: \u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental distinction between thought and behavior, and this is what concerns me most about policing our imagination. Sexual misconduct is a serious societal problem that deserves the attention of men of all sexual orientations, but in our effort to eradicate sexual assault and rape culture, we need not rid ourselves of desire and lust.\u201d\n\nThought and behavior do not live separately; in fact, they depend on each other. Thoughts create behavior. And behaviors, practiced enough, create environments and culture.\n\nInside of spaces for queer men, patriarchal thoughts are accepted\u2014thoughts like the fantasies void of consent, like what Boykins wrote about Moore: \u201cI turn him toward the tree and enter him from behind, holding his neck down for balance and dominance.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not just a fantasy detailing an erotic wish; this is a fantasy detailing assault\u2014shared publicly with an alarming lack of awareness of how its publishing alone could make its subject uncomfortable or unsafe.\n\nPatriarchal behavior is constantly excused and often fetishized. There are countless articles demonstrating how stereotypical toxic masculine behavior, which includes everything from exhibiting violent behaviors when mad to touching people with no consent, is preferred by a large portion of gay men. Because of this, a patriarchal culture and environment are created. And one of the symptoms of this patriarchal environment is rape culture. This is the culture that made Boykin think that expressing his more-toxic fantasies was a just rebuttal to an article about queerness and objectification.\n\nMy second thought when reading Boykin\u2019s article was how people\u2014especially those who claim a radical queer or gay politic\u2014must elevate the conversation around desire, lust and the erotic. Whom you lust over and how you lust and how you express desire for another man is not created in a vacuum; it is informed by everything you\u2019ve experienced up until that lustful moment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Moore was pushing us to think about with his article is what informs these \u201crandom\u201d moments of dehumanizing someone who has the same gender, sexuality and race experience as oneself.\n\nMoments where black men can\u2019t engage with other black men beyond their body, face or sexuality disturb me because it reminds me of the narrative of black men\u2019s history in America. It reminds me that even between two black men, the physical appraisal of someone takes priority over a type of intellectual or nonsexual emotional engagement with each other.\n\nIt reminds me of the auction block, where black people were mules being looked over. It reminds me of the rape and castration of black men and the narrative that the sum of black men\u2019s worth is in their sexuality, their labor and their usefulness inside of the white supremacist patriarchy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, your wet dream fantasy is not harmless. It strips black men of humanity and instead demonizes and eroticizes them beyond recognition.\n\nFinally, there was a total lack of any kind of analysis on power. As I read the cases against Harvey Weinstein as well as Bill Cosby, one common thread I found was their power to change environments\u2014to turn professional spaces into sexual ones. To transform friendly outings into dangerous, predatory moments.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that before a Cosby places a drug inside a martini, or before a Weinstein pulls his dick out of his pants, a sexual, erotic fantasy often occurs that involves the rapist in power and the victim submitting. They act on that fantasy and quickly change the environment from a safe moment to a dangerous, predatory moment. One\u2019s ability to do that as a man still exists, even if the one being pursued is another man. That is something to agitate, interrogate and\u2014perhaps\u2014even police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven inside my own experiences with rape, sexual assault, harassment and molestation, it is clear that the untamed male imagination is what activated those violent moments in my life. I know transgender people who were killed because of a cisgender man\u2019s untamed imagination and his shame around it. From experience, I have undergone rape and assault because of closeted, masculine men\u2019s untamed imaginations.\n\nThe imagination is something to take seriously. Writers and intellectuals especially should know this, since so much of our work is rooted in the imagination and our ability to capture that of the public.\n\nMy boyfriend is alive, but in those toxic moments when I thought about harm and violence, I thought about what else was lurking. I found that a struggle for power and an insecurity informed by patriarchal standards lived in our relationship dynamic, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a way, Boykin is correct: Thoughts and the imagination are not things to be policed, but they are something to be examined, and in some cases, they hold hints to where the soul needs healing.

He blistered at N.O.R.E.\u2019s penchant for continually hounding him about a deal he botched as a young lawyer, schooled me on interviewing techniques, gushed over his favorite podcasting equipment and shared a sneak preview of his next endeavor, Mogul, which was released earlier this year to universal acclaim.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmazed that I was able to get this kind of one-on-one time with him, I told him how much of a profound impact he had on me and how he was directly responsible for my own show even existing. Before I knew it, nearly two hours had passed. And as much as I appreciated chopping it up on some barbershop shit, it was time to shoot my shot.\n\nI prattled off about how we tackle difficult subjects within our community but infuse humor in order to make them more digestible. How our show was exactly what his network was missing and how we fit a need. He was impressed at our list of guests. \u201cY\u2019all did that yourself?\u201d Yup.\n\nBut before I could stunt on Instagram and commemorate our new partnership with obnoxious selfies and imaginary bottles of Champagne, I heard three fateful words: \u201cHolla at Matt.\u201d Matt, of course, being the innocuous white guy who, thanks to no formal introduction courtesy of Combat Jack, had no idea I had just spent the last two hours talking to his boss. Matt would also be the one to kill my dreams of throwing on that Loud Speakers jersey by referring me to the contact form on their website. \u201cSubmit your show on there and we\u2019ll check it out.\u201d Ouch. Thanks, Matt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the time, I was devastated, but in hindsight, I realized I wasn\u2019t heavy enough in the podcast game to just waltz up to Combat Jack and expect him to snatch up my show. Dejected, I remember walking back to my car afterward promising myself that the next time I saw him, he would know who the hell I was.\n\nOver the next nine months, I proceeded to bust my ass building momentum for my podcast. Our social media following skyrocketed to over 80,000 followers; we joined forces with the big homies Panama Jackson and Damon Young for a watch party in Washington, D.C., for BET\u2019s The New Edition Story; got shoutouts in numerous publications, including Bitch Media and the New York Times; got invited to SXSW to perform a live episode of our show; announced a partnership with streaming media juggernaut TuneIn; and got nominated for Best Society and Culture Podcast in the People\u2019s Choice Podcast Awards. A bunch of other accolades and opportunities fell into our laps as a direct result of our success. So when I heard that Combat Jack was returning to Los Angeles for BET Weekend in June to do another live show, I was ready this time.\n\nAbout 20 minutes before his show started, I ran into him inside the venue. Much to my surprise, he rolled up on me. \u201cYo, it\u2019s Jay, right?\u201d Wait, what? He must have me confused with somebody else. I started to remind him of how we met at Now Hear This, but he shut me down quick: \u201cYo, I wanna come on your show. I leave on Monday. Let\u2019s make it happen.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhoa.\n\nKnowing how much he prided himself on preparing for his interviews (a trait I inherited from him) and realizing that him coming on to my show was essentially my audition for the Loud Speakers Network, I knew rushing to record that weekend was a terrible idea. Much to even my own surprise, I declined. Instead, I offered to bring him on in a few weeks. To which he replied, \u201cBet. No bullshit. I wanna come on. Y\u2019all moving out here.\u201d He snatched my phone out of my hand, plugged his number in, asked someone to get a picture of us, dapped me up, then dissolved into the crowd. Thankfully, Matt was nowhere to be found this time.\n\nAfter locking in his interview, I was so amped I took my ass straight home after his show and stayed up until 3 a.m. researching him on the internet. Over the course of the next few weeks, I called or texted various people who had personal relationships with him and dragged tidbits of information out of them to craft questions around. After an absurd amount of research and preparation, I was 100 percent confident I would deliver his best interview ever. But sadly, fate had other plans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough we texted back and forth trying to lock in a date, his schedule was bananas. First it was Vegas, then it was family. Soon it was becoming painfully obvious that the opportunity to interview the man who single-handedly changed my life and so many others was diminishing. But our failure to lock in his interview doesn\u2019t upset me at all. It\u2019s the fact that I never had the opportunity to thank him.\n\nSimply put, in launching the Loud Speakers Network, Combat Jack provided so many of us with a voice. In a world consumed with diluting, disparaging and disposing of any semblance of blackness, he created a platform for us to be our unapologetic selves. And while he wasn\u2019t the first black podcaster, he was easily the most influential. You can literally pinpoint the trajectory of podcasting before and after the birth of the Loud Speakers Network.\n\nIn fact, if you eliminate his contributions and influence, many of your favorite comedians, entertainers and media personalities wouldn\u2019t be where they are today. That\u2019s a fact. The argument can even be made that SoundCloud is only being kept afloat because podcasters funnel so much money into it. Though SoundCloud is widely maligned in podcasting circles, an overwhelming majority of podcasters of color host their own shows on the platform anyway in order to emulate Loud Speakers Network\u2019s formula.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut for creatives such as myself, he provided us with far more than just a voice. He gave us our calling. After moving to Los Angeles in 2014 to jump-start my own writing career, I quickly realized that instead of pounding the pavement to work my way up the food chain, the fastest way to reel in the writing opportunities I wanted was to leverage my personality into popularity.\n\nAs such, podcasting has allowed me to reach millions of people I otherwise never would. It\u2019s allowed me to travel the country and generate awareness around important issues such as mental health in the black community, social justice and the pervasiveness of toxic masculinity. It\u2019s allowed me to change lives, speak in schools and on panels, and celebrate the agency and accomplishments of people of color. Podcasting has provided me with invaluable relationships and has opened countless doors that would otherwise have remained closed. In short, podcasting has given me\u2014and countless others\u2014purpose.\n\nAnd that\u2019s solely because of Combat Jack.\n\nHis death teaches us not only that one man has the power to move mountains but also why it\u2019s important that we champion our heroes while they\u2019re still here to move them. May his spirit live on in each of us.", "keywords": ["live", "jack", "ode", "network", "matt", "media", "podcasting", "combat", "heroes", "podcast", "loud", "speakers"], "polarity": 0.12977480751203374, "subjectivity": 0.4925250945323938},

That\u2019s just kind of what it does. White America acts as if Kaepernick pulled a Josh Howard. Who is Josh Howard and what did he do?

Leveraging their popular podcast into TV stardom, \u201cthe Bodega Boys\u201d riff on popular culture, politics and (mostly) white people. They\u2019ve become the popular destination for the coolest guests because their show is basically The Daily Show if Trevor Noah were a pair of weed-smoking, 40-ounce-drinking dudes from the Bronx, N.Y..\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bodega Boys\u2019 beef with DJ Envy began when text messages surfaced of DJ Envy (who is married) chatting with someone who suggested butt play with the Power 105.1 FM host. As usual, Desus and Mero became the hood version of CNN, exposing the story:\n\nThe dispute continued when DJ Envy appeared on an episode of The Real with his wife, seemingly trying to contain the damage. The couple were very honest about the radio host\u2019s past indiscretions, making it appear that they had fixed all of their problems. Desus and Mero, who never shy away from controversy, made fun of the appearance by Envy and his wife because ... well, that\u2019s what they do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, on Thursday morning, Desus and Mero appeared on The Breakfast Club. Envy was in his feelings from the time the men walked in, and there was nothing wrong with that except the men didn\u2019t realize there was a beef.\n\n\n\nAfter introducing his guests as \u201cDickhead\u201d and \u201cPussy,\u201d which is mad passive-aggressive and totally light-skinned, Envy began to explain the impetus behind his beige rage. (Oh, did I mention that Envy was sporting a \u201cMy God vs. My Enemies\u201d hat, which was totally planned because isn\u2019t it just like a light-skinned man to wear passive-aggressive clothing to a fuss fight?)\n\n\u201cYou owe my wife an apology,\u201d Envy said to a baffled Desus and Mero. \u201cWhen you insinuated that she was there for the check.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen DJ Envy played the clip in which Desus and Mero totally insinuated that Envy\u2019s wife was sticking around for the check. Envy wasn\u2019t going full light-skinned for being mad about that. It was a low blow for the talk show guests to take shots at Envy\u2019s wife. Envy explained that wives and children were off-limits, and the guests agreed and apologized.\n\nWhere Envy drove his Jeep Grand Cherokee off the road (yes, Jeep Grand Cherokees are the preferred cars of light-skinned men; just ask any Kappa) was when he couldn\u2019t let it go. He literally stewed in his anger like a spoiled child unable to accept that he\u2019d actually gotten his way. Not sure if Envy came into work looking for a fight, but what he found was an apology, and that wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nEnvy proceeded to hard-chew his gum (totally light-skinned and passive-aggressive), and make snide remarks before he went full Sinbad and walked off the show, undoing all of Matt Barnes\u2019 good work to dispel the myth that light-skinned men will walk off the air.\n\nAt that point, if Envy was still upset, he should\u2019ve reached across the table and taken a swing at Desus (because Mero is heavier; Dominican\u2014which means there is a 62 percent chance he had a razor under his tongue; and because I\u2019m not here for light-skinned-on-light-skinned crime).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know, because that is what rapper Casanova 2x would\u2019ve done. He is my spiritual guide whenever I\u2019m trying to sort out whether or not I\u2019m inside my light-skinned bag. I can\u2019t see Casanova 2x pushing the microphone away and storming out of the interview after receiving an apology, if for no other reason than he made this song and you can\u2019t get passive-aggressive after rhyming that you would punch someone\u2019s teeth out.\n\nMy sources tell me that Envy walked off the air and into his office, where he took a few swings at the air and then curled up on the floor in the fetal position and had a good cry, and it was well-earned.

For it was Kaep, your holiness, who took that knee for the people, and because of that knee, I turned my channel to other things on Sunday, amazingly gaining what felt like an extra entire day of my life every week.\n\nWhile I have appreciated that extra full day, I have fallen short of the glory a few times.

And if I had to break my fast for any reason, thank you Lord for placing me in a spot showing the end of the New Orleans #BlewDat game against the Vikings of Minnesota to let me know that you, DaGawd, have a sense of epic-ality since, I mean, wow.

I\u2019m calling it 28-17.\n\nLord, please help those of us who aren\u2019t going to engage with the Super Bowl find faith and fellowship in other means that are Super Bowl-tangential, like parties where we watch Panther (somebody has to have the DVD) and Eyes on the Prize or even\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014movies starring Taye Diggs or Nia Long.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHelp us feel vindication in our veracity as we attempt to talk about everything but the Super Bowl while we pretend to check our phones for Scripture while refreshing a sports-score app. Not me, heavens no, spiritual sir\u2014I won\u2019t be checking the score, though I cannot pretend I won\u2019t view any updates my phone sends to me on its own.\n\nFather, thank you for giving me resolve and Sunday, Monday and Thursday strength and for giving me purpose and prescience to stay woke; niggas are creepin\u2019.

Envy, Charlamagne tha God and Angela Yee.\n\nHill not only talked about his road to success\u2014from dropping out of Morehouse to homelessness, from selling incense on the streets of Atlanta to receiving a Ph.D.\u2014but also made it clear that when it comes to the 2016 presidential election, there is no \"lesser of two evils\" in our current political duopoly.\n\nW.E.B. Du Bois said in 1956, \u201cI believe that democracy has so far disappeared in the United States that no \u2018two evils\u2019 exist.\u201d Hill takes that philosophy and makes it plain.\n\n\n\nThe DNC disappointed me because it looked like a Republican convention. \u2026 \u201c[Democrats] tried to take the patriotism language that the Republicans usually use in their conferences and used it for their own. They talked about war. They talked about the economy in a way that sounded like Republicans from 20 years ago. Part of the reason it was so easy for Melania to jack Michelle Obama\u2019s speech is because they\u2019re all saying the same stuff. I'm not scared of Trump. I'm scared of us as a country moving in the wrong direction. \u2026 Republicans are always talking about terrorism, but Democrats are playing on a certain kind of terrorism, too. They're essentially saying, \u2018If you don't vote for us, then you're going to have Donald Trump and your life will be ruined.\u2019 If you frame that as the choice, you never get to demand what you actually deserve and what you actually want.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen D.J. Envy asked did Hill \"like\" Hillary Clinton, he responded unapologetically:\n\n\n\nI wouldn't vote for her. I'm voting for the Green Party. \u2026 They're not going to win this election. But if the differences between the two candidates aren't vast enough, then I would rather introduce a third candidate to build a movement. Because every four years we say, 'The third party can't win.' So we never invest in the third party. We never grow the third party. If they get 5 percent of the vote, they can be in the debates. And if they're in the debates, now we can change the conversation.\n\nAfter Envy said that Democrats voting third party would take votes away from Clinton, ultimately paving the way for a Donald Trump presidency, Hill laid the truth on the table:\n\n\n\nI would rather have Trump be president for four years and build a real left-wing movement that can get us what we deserve as a people, than to let Hillary be president and we stay locked in the same space where we don't get what we want.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHill went on to say that he would rather Trump not be president, period, but that we can't keep investing in \"imperfect Democrats who don't take us anywhere.\"\n\n\n\nWe can afford to lose an election; we can't afford to lose our values.\n\nWatch below for Hill talking more Trump, \"black-on-black\" crime as pathology and Drake's \"light-skin\" music:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso on The Root: \u201cDear Centrists: The Left Has Something to Say Whether You Like It or Not\u201d", "keywords": ["values", "election", "party", "hill", "vote", "talked", "voting", "president", "trump", "green", "afford", "republicans", "democrats", "lamont", "theyre", "say", "lose", "marc"], "polarity": 0.07415824915824916, "subjectivity": 0.40971620971620976},

And, while, no, Charlamagne didn\u2019t talk about killing trans women, Ashlee Marie Preston said that Charlamagne was the ringleader of Lil Duval\u2019s transphobic rhetoric on The Breakfast Club Friday morning.\n\nShe said there was no reason to ask the comedian about Donald Trump\u2019s ban on transgender troops serving in the military, which led to his using a transphobic slur that starts with a \u201ct.\u201d In addition, Lil Duval isn\u2019t particularly known for his insights on military policy. Breakfast Club co-host DJ Envy further exacerbated the drama by asking how Lil Duval would respond if a woman revealed that she was transgender after four months of dating. His reply that she would end up dead was one Charlamagne and crew surely expected.\n\n\u201cThey brought that up knowing he would have a reaction,\u201d said Preston, who staged an action against Charlamagne at Politicon in Pasadena, Calif., on Sunday. \u201cThey know we\u2019re in the age of pro-trans identity, of doing better and being decent people. So they still wanted to get that buzz when they were the ones making those statements directly. But they wanted to use Lil Duval as the voice for what they really wanted to say.\u201d\n\nThe Breakfast Club co-hosts defended themselves Monday morning, with Charlamagne defiantly saying, \u201cI\u2019m not apologizing for the words of Lil Duval.\u201d\n\nPreston said that\u2019s a cop-out. The co-hosts knew that asking the comedian about trans issues would evoke a controversial statement, making them equally accountable, she said. Preston, who is the first transgender editor in chief of the intersectional feminist magazine Wear Your Voice, is joining other trans activists in trying to force The Breakfast Club to confront what they say is its casual acceptance of transphobic behavior. Elle Hearns, founder and executive director of the Marsha P. Johnson Institute, started a petition to boycott The Breakfast Club. Raquel Willis started #TransFolksAreNotJokes on Saturday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn interviews with The Root, transgender activists said that they are organizing efforts to force iHeartRadio, the company that owns The Breakfast Club, to apologize. The petition organized by Hearns goes further, demanding that Charlamagne apologize for allowing a transphobic conversation to take place and that iHeartRadio cancel the show.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that any person who is born with any kind of consciousness could ever take joy in watching people be hurt,\u201d Hearns said. \u201cHe has a long history of anti-black rhetoric with black women. To watch black trans women be disrespected is to also watch black women be disrespected. And we\u2019ve seen that behavior from him many times before, which is why he, in particular, has become a target because of his unwillingness to acknowledge that he is wrong.\u201d\n\nWhat neither Charlamagne nor his co-hosts seem to understand is that the very passive tone of their conversation with Lil Duval creates a culture where violence against trans women is accepted, the activists told me. Human Rights Watch reports that 22 trans women have been killed in the United States so far in 2017, with most of them being trans women of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I asked if the activists would be willing to speak with Charlamagne, some of them kept that door open, citing one exception: not on his show. Giving The Breakfast Club ratings isn\u2019t something they\u2019re interested in. Besides, they say they are not very optimistic that talking to him will do that much good. Days before Lil Duval\u2019s transphobic appearance, Janet Mock spoke with the co-hosts about being transgender. A few days later, Charlamagne used her as a sexual prop for Lil Duval\u2019s sick humor by raising her name in his discussion with Duval.\n\nIn Allure, Mock spoke out against the show\u2019s treatment of her.\n\n\u201cHe was completely dismissive of that experience and allowed her to be a punch line and material for a comedian,\u201d Willis said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put myself in that situation. If it was outside of the show, if it was a panel or a discussion between us two, I would go to an event like that and be a part of that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lil Duval episode is about trans black women, but there is a larger, overarching issue concerning what they feel is Charlamagne\u2019s anti-black woman rhetoric, L\u2019lerr\u00e9t Ailith, communications director for Black Youth Project 100, told me. Charlamagne likes to project an image of wokeness, she said, given his support of the Black Lives Matter movement and his political engagement in the 2016 election, though he seems to fail when it comes to gender.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to continue to cape for Charlamagne and say he just needs to be educated,\u201d Ailith said. \u201cJanet Mock was just on his show. As she wrote in her article, she doesn\u2019t do Trans 101, but she did it for them. She went step by step, educating them on the basics of what it means to be a trans person very eloquently, and Charlamagne still refuses to take that lesson and incorporate it into his politics. I don\u2019t think he is really willing to relinquish himself the bigotry he internalized.\u201d\n\nIn December he sparked controversy when he tweeted that more black women need to build platforms like Tomi Lahren, the young white woman who used her time at TheBlaze to direct racist diatribes at black people for mass white supremacist consumption. He didn\u2019t help quell reactions from black women by having her on his show, either. Media executive Jamilah Lemieux and social-justice activist Amber Phillips appeared on his show in an attempt to explain why giving Lahren a platform was ill-advised.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, like clockwork, it appears to have done little good. Charlamagne continues to propagate anti-trans behavior, which is why the activists aren\u2019t backing down from their demands that his show be held accountable. Twitter users are continuing to upload videos of support to #TransFolksAreNotJokes. The #BreakfastClubBoycott petition is gaining stream, and Preston is planning further actions against The Breakfast Club this week.\n\nTrying to reason with Charlamagne\u2019s indignation is pointless, she said.\n\n\u201cThere need to be consequences.\u201d Preston said. \u201cIf we just tell people, \u2018You should be a better person and you should feel different,\u2019 what is that? We\u2019re still going to lose our lives. They are still going to say problematic things and reinforcing ideologies that put us in danger. What we\u2019re learning is that some of the strongest forms of activism is when you hit a muthafucka in their pockets. Period.

At the time, he was 22; his victim, Jules Woodson, was 17.\n\nOn Thursday night, Highpoint Church\u2019s lead pastor, Chris Conlee, announced in a statement that the church had issued Savage a leave of absence to begin immediately.\n\nEarlier:\n\nToday we bring you two accounts of pastors accused of sexually assaulting minors\u2014with two very different endings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn one case coming out of Fayetteville, N.C., a former pastor has been charged with 142 charges of child sex crimes, including the rapes of four children. According to WTVD-TV, Glenn Tyrone Collins has been accused of repeatedly sexually abusing children between 1996 and 2009.\n\nThe TV outlet notes that one of the alleged victims was Collins\u2019 neighbor. But a look at the charges against Collins\u2014namely, 39 counts of sexual activity by a parent\u2014indicates that Collins is also accused of abusing one or more of his own children or, at the very least, someone for whom he was the primary guardian.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice say that they picked up the case after one of Collins\u2019 accusers came forward, describing the alleged abuse as years of emotional torture, according to WTVD-TV. Collins turned himself in to police on Monday after a warrant was issued for his arrest.\n\nAt a bond hearing, Collins pleaded with a judge for his release, defended his reputation as a pillar in the community and told the court that he wasn\u2019t \u201cguilty of this stuff.\u201d\n\nAs of Tuesday, the former pastor was being held at the Cumberland County Jail on a $3.75 million bond.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs North Carolina police were securing warrants against Collins, in Memphis, Tenn., a pastor of a megachurch there received a standing ovation from his congregation Sunday after admitting to his abuse of a child.\n\nAndy Savage admitted to his flock that he had engaged in a \u201csexual incident\u201d with a teenage girl he drove home from church 20 years ago. He was a youth minister at a church in suburban Houston at the time.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the New York Times:\n\n[Savage] did not tell the congregation at Highpoint Church what took place in 1998, but he said that he had sinned, taken responsibility for it and never kept it a secret from church leaders. He said that before [his accuser] took her story public, he believed that the episode had been \u201cdealt with in Texas.\u201d \u201cUntil now, I did not know there was unfinished business with Jules,\u201d Mr. Savage, 42, said during the service, which was streamed live online. \u201cJules, I am deeply sorry for my actions 20 years ago. I remain committed to cooperate with you toward forgiveness and healing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, Savage didn\u2019t come forward with his \u201csin\u201d of his own volition. His accuser, Jules Woodson, went public just days before, writing a blog post that detailed his assault against her.\n\nIn the blog, which highlights sexual abuse within the church, Woodson says that Savage offered to take her home from church, where she had gone after school. Instead of dropping her off at her house, though, Savage drove past to a secluded area and had Woodson perform oral sex on him. Later, she says, Savage got out of the car and went to her passenger-side door, getting on his knees and begging her not to tell anyone what happened.\n\nAccording to Woodson, the man of Gold told her, \u201cYou can\u2019t tell anyone, Jules, please. You have to take this to the grave with you.\u201d She was 17 years old at the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWoodson says that she reached out to Savage following news of Matt Lauer\u2019s firing from NBC for sexual abuse, asking him in an email if he remembered that night, and the sexual assault that took place.\n\nSavage never responded to her. After a month of no reply, reports the Times, Woodson decided that it was time to go public with her story.\n\nWoodson also told the Times that she had reported the incident to an associate pastor at the church back in \u201998. Instead of reporting the incident to authorities, Woodson says that Larry Cotton, a pastor at Woodlands Parkway Baptist Church, advised her to stay quiet and said that the church would address the issue itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the Times:\n\nAfter Ms. Woodson told Mr. Cotton about her story in 1998, she said the church sent Mr. Savage to apologize to her mother. But he never told her mother explicitly what had happened, leaving the impression that they had only kissed. In Sunday\u2019s service, Mr. Savage said that at the time he handled the situation in a \u201cbiblical way\u201d and resigned from the church and returned to his hometown, Memphis.\ufeff\n\nWhere, as we know, Savage simply went on to another church.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d like to know specifically what \u201cbiblical way\u201d Savage took to address this situation. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t wandering in the desert for 40 years. And I must have missed the part in the Bible where a man of God takes advantage of a teenage girl, gets called out on his behavior and then just bounces to another, bigger church where he receives a 20-second standing ovation for admitting he abused his power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe that\u2019s in Deuteronomy, or maybe Jesus only wanted teenage girls in dark, secluded places to touch the hem of his garment.\n\nEither way, Highpoint Church says it\u2019s standing by its man.\n\nRead more at WTDV-TV and the New York Times.", "keywords": ["assaulting", "admitted", "teen", "jules", "woodson", "savage", "told", "took", "sexually", "pastor", "church", "sexual", "mr", "collins", "leave"], "polarity": 0.09166528925619834, "subjectivity": 0.44981031090121987},

Today I am here to admit to white America that I was totally wrong about Orenthal James Simpson. (I know using \u201cwhite\u201d as an adjective to describe \u201cAmerica\u201d is redundant, but I just want to make sure I acknowledge the Caucasians who \u201cbuilt this country\u201d because\u2014aside from history books, movies, television, literature, the national narrative and Donald Trump rallies\u2014you rarely receive the credit you are due. Big ups to you.)\n\nOn Sunday night, Fox News reignited the ire of white people who are still dumbstruck that a man could get away with an obvious murder when the decidedly unfair and mentally imbalanced network aired a decade-old interview of O.J. Simpson appearing to confess, in which he laid out how he might have, theoretically, murdered his ex-wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite America, I am now on your side. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. You were right all along.\n\nWhite people hate O.J. For them, he is evil incarnate. After all, if a black man could get away with killing a white woman in a wealthy neighborhood, how could anyone feel safe?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can\u2019t fathom how black-hearted I must have seemed back in 1995 when I applauded the O.J. verdict. I now realize how upset you guys must have felt to see a cold-blooded killer like O.J. get set free. Well, actually, I forgot that I felt those same emotions after the George Zimmerman acquittal.\n\nAnd the Betty Shelby trial.\n\nAnd the Philando Castile decision.\n\nAnd the decision not to indict Darren Wilson for the shooting death of Michael Brown Jr.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the acquittal of Jeronimo Yanez.\n\nOK, I also now realize that saying \u201cI now realize\u201d was probably a bad choice of words.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: I always believed O.J. did that shit.\n\n\n\nWhen black people celebrated the O.J. acquittal in 1995, it was not because we thought he was a symbol of innocence and purity who was preparing to buy NBC. It was because the O.J. case exposed the bigotry that permeates the entire justice system in America and how\u2014despite his celebrity, wealth and resources\u2014a black man could be deemed guilty simply from an outpouring of alabaster outrage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe believed that he was a murderer and we believed the Los Angeles Police Department tried to frame him by tampering with evidence. Both things were probably true. Given black people\u2019s relationship with cops, the then-recent Rodney King verdict, the criminal-justice system and the legacy of black men who were lynched for breathing in the direction of white women, I\u2019m sure you could understand why we celebrated the O.J. verdict. We weren\u2019t on O.J.\u2019s team. We were Team JohnnyCochran. We were #TeamFuckTheLAPD.\n\nThis Lying, Murdering Whore Called America Today\u2014almost a year after a man who took an oath to protect and serve sent a bullet into the skull\u2026 Read more Read\n\nBut before Fox\u2019s O.J. special, I had never seen someone give a detailed explanation of how they murdered an innocent human being with a straight face and showing no remorse. To be fair, I missed George Zimmerman\u2019s interview on Hannity. I also forgot to DVR his appearance on CNN. Oh, and that Daily Beast article where he said that Trayvon Martin\u2019s parents \u201cdidn\u2019t raise him right\u201d and treated him \u201clike a dog without a leash\u201d\u2014I never got around to reading it. So this was my first time witnessing something like this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut now that O.J. has hypothetically confessed on national television, I understand how you feel that our system shouldn\u2019t let an unrepentant killer walk around white women all willy-nilly. He may have been found not guilty in a court of law, but that doesn\u2019t mean he is innocent. What if he\u2019s triggered by a different pair of thin upper lips or oblate buttocks and goes on another killing spree? We just watched him confess!\n\nI felt the same way about Betty Shelby, who admitted on 60 Minutes that Terence Crutcher was not belligerent and not aggressive and had his hands up with his back to her when she shot him in Tulsa, Okla. Shelby is now back patrolling the streets as a law enforcement officer. So is Daniel Pantaleo, the man whose arms just happened to be wrapped around Eric Garner\u2019s throat in a loving caress when Garner died on a New York City sidewalk.\n\nI haven\u2019t heard any white outrage about the potential of someone becoming a victim of those two not-convicted killers, but I\u2019m sure white people are equally concerned. I probably missed it because I was still giddy from dancing at the secret, black O.J. victory party. Pantaleo and Shelby are still paid to carry guns and \u201cuphold the law.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut O.J., though.\n\nI recognize that my change of heart may be long overdue, but you know what they say: Better late than never. (Actually, I don\u2019t know if \u201cthey\u201d really say that, but I hope the teller says it with a smile on that glorious day when I\u2019m at the bank filling out the slip to deposit my reparations check.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause I now identify with your outrage after watching a murderer hypothetically confess to a theoretical crime for which he will never be punished. When I see you at the Black Lives Matter march the next time a police officer murders an innocent person of color and gets away with it, I will be sure to apologize to your face. Or maybe I\u2019ll do it when I see you applauding NFL players who are kneeling in hopes that it will bring attention to the kinds of injustice that you are surprisingly so upset about.\n\nAfter all, if you\u2019re mad at O.J., you should be mad at anyone who kills an innocent, unarmed, defenseless human being and gets away with it. If Fox News viewers are incensed about O.J., then the only way they couldn\u2019t be equally infuriated about the disproportionate killing of innocent black people by obviously guilty police officers is if they were racist. But they are not, because all lives matter ...\n\nHypothetically.", "keywords": ["away", "confession", "innocent", "wrong", "black", "watching", "realize", "sure", "hypothetical", "white", "simpson", "shelby", "oj", "america", "man", "right"], "polarity": 0.040153122455102656, "subjectivity": 0.48566481648164816},

And the NFL our biggest and most popular sports league. But while the NFL\u2019s status as the king of America\u2019s sports hill remains, I don\u2019t remember its position ever being as precarious. To wit, each of the biggest NFL-related stories of the year has been extremely unflattering to the league.\n\nThere\u2019s all of the Colin Kaepernick-related stories (the protests, the reactions from the fans and the front offices and the freakin president to the protests, the boycotts, and the possible collusion to blackball him). And, then, the action on the field has been overshadowed by the conversations about what the action on the field is doing to the brains and bodies of the players.\n\nThe NFL\u2019s ratings have reflected this, falling 9.7 percent this year after falling 8 percent last year\u2014a dip that was then attributed to the election. This decline has led to a $300 million drop in ad revenue. Which, for a multibillion-dollar behemoth, isn\u2019t the end of the world. I doubt anyone in the league\u2019s front office is panicking. But I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the whiskeys they order at their pre-Super Bowl meetings and parties this weekend were doubles.\n\nNaturally, there are myriad possible reasons for this decline in viewership. Most notable is the fact that there are just too many things to watch and too many ways to consume media. People are just doing other things.\n\nIt is interesting, though, that a week before the Super Bowl\u2014the biggest sports and television event of the year\u2014the stories dominating the national sports conversation have nothing to do with the NFL. Instead, we\u2019re discussing, debating and arguing about a draft. A draft for the NBA All-Star Game. A draft that wasn\u2019t even televised. A motherfucking conference call. A Skype conversation between LeBron James and Steph Curry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, I\u2019m sure by this time next week (as the actual game nears), the NFL will be back at the center of our public and cultural consciousness. Especially as the country puts our collective psychic powers together to band against Tom Brady and his merry crew of\u201cMAGA\u201d Patriots.\n\nAnd like every other year, there will be Super Bowl parties, where many people will be only tangentially interested in the actual game.

Leveraging their popular podcast into TV stardom, \u201cthe Bodega Boys\u201d riff on popular culture, politics and (mostly) white people. They\u2019ve become the popular destination for the coolest guests because their show is basically The Daily Show if Trevor Noah were a pair of weed-smoking, 40-ounce-drinking dudes from the Bronx, N.Y..\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bodega Boys\u2019 beef with DJ Envy began when text messages surfaced of DJ Envy (who is married) chatting with someone who suggested butt play with the Power 105.1 FM host. As usual, Desus and Mero became the hood version of CNN, exposing the story:\n\nThe dispute continued when DJ Envy appeared on an episode of The Real with his wife, seemingly trying to contain the damage. The couple were very honest about the radio host\u2019s past indiscretions, making it appear that they had fixed all of their problems. Desus and Mero, who never shy away from controversy, made fun of the appearance by Envy and his wife because ... well, that\u2019s what they do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, on Thursday morning, Desus and Mero appeared on The Breakfast Club. Envy was in his feelings from the time the men walked in, and there was nothing wrong with that except the men didn\u2019t realize there was a beef.\n\n\n\nAfter introducing his guests as \u201cDickhead\u201d and \u201cPussy,\u201d which is mad passive-aggressive and totally light-skinned, Envy began to explain the impetus behind his beige rage. (Oh, did I mention that Envy was sporting a \u201cMy God vs. My Enemies\u201d hat, which was totally planned because isn\u2019t it just like a light-skinned man to wear passive-aggressive clothing to a fuss fight?)\n\n\u201cYou owe my wife an apology,\u201d Envy said to a baffled Desus and Mero. \u201cWhen you insinuated that she was there for the check.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen DJ Envy played the clip in which Desus and Mero totally insinuated that Envy\u2019s wife was sticking around for the check. Envy wasn\u2019t going full light-skinned for being mad about that. It was a low blow for the talk show guests to take shots at Envy\u2019s wife. Envy explained that wives and children were off-limits, and the guests agreed and apologized.\n\nWhere Envy drove his Jeep Grand Cherokee off the road (yes, Jeep Grand Cherokees are the preferred cars of light-skinned men; just ask any Kappa) was when he couldn\u2019t let it go. He literally stewed in his anger like a spoiled child unable to accept that he\u2019d actually gotten his way. Not sure if Envy came into work looking for a fight, but what he found was an apology, and that wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nEnvy proceeded to hard-chew his gum (totally light-skinned and passive-aggressive), and make snide remarks before he went full Sinbad and walked off the show, undoing all of Matt Barnes\u2019 good work to dispel the myth that light-skinned men will walk off the air.\n\nAt that point, if Envy was still upset, he should\u2019ve reached across the table and taken a swing at Desus (because Mero is heavier; Dominican\u2014which means there is a 62 percent chance he had a razor under his tongue; and because I\u2019m not here for light-skinned-on-light-skinned crime).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know, because that is what rapper Casanova 2x would\u2019ve done. He is my spiritual guide whenever I\u2019m trying to sort out whether or not I\u2019m inside my light-skinned bag. I can\u2019t see Casanova 2x pushing the microphone away and storming out of the interview after receiving an apology, if for no other reason than he made this song and you can\u2019t get passive-aggressive after rhyming that you would punch someone\u2019s teeth out.\n\nMy sources tell me that Envy walked off the air and into his office, where he took a few swings at the air and then curled up on the floor in the fetal position and had a good cry, and it was well-earned. (And by \u201csources,\u201d I mean my imagination, which is definitely a source.)\n\nEnvy wasn\u2019t wrong for sticking up for his wife\u2019s honor. That\u2019s the commendable part of what he did. Hell, owning up to his cheating on national radio and national television is a real look at grown-man shit. But come on, bruh, Vin Diesel didn\u2019t threaten to beat up Dwayne \u201cthe Rock\u201d Johnson in real life for you to match your hat to your emotions.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is only one way that Envy can undo this: He\u2019s going to have to fight Charlamagne tha God in a caged death match or admit on the air that he went full light-skinned and then apologize to his guests.\n\nOr, maybe, to redeem his credentials and escape the official censure at the next meeting of #TeamLightSkinned, he can go on Desus and Mero\u2019s show as a guest and fight them both.\n\nWatch out for the razor, though.", "keywords": ["envys", "radio", "totally", "real", "dj", "passiveaggressive", "moment", "lightskinned", "history", "men", "desus", "walkoff", "envy", "wife", "tantrum", "mero"], "polarity": 0.09482704402515722, "subjectivity": 0.5569444444444446},

Not only did he donate $1 million of his own money, but he did this while unemployed. It isn\u2019t likely that Kaepernick will be receiving endorsement deals. It doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s a job on the horizon, and yet he\u2019s put his money where his mouth is. Not to mention, Kaepernick is using his celebrity cachet to encourage other famous folks to match his donation.\n\nHere\u2019s how ESPN breaks down the donations:\n\n\n\nThe first charity announced was Silicon Valley De-Bug, a community organization in San Jose and Northern California\u2019s South Bay that benefits youth, immigrants and low-wage workers. The match to Kaepernick\u2019s $10,000 comes courtesy of Golden State Warriors forward Kevin Durant. The $20,000 total will go toward travel stipends for families to visit their loved ones in prison; raising awareness of a campaign for a law that would increase protections to young people in prison; funding pretrial release for those who can\u2019t make bail; and supporting initiatives that seek to end bail. Since October 2016, Kaepernick has donated to more than 30 charitable recipients ranging from Mothers Against Police Brutality to the I Will Not Die Young Campaign. His donations have been earmarked for everything from clothing for the needy to caskets for the dead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to ESPN, Kaepernick made $12.3 million in 2016, which may sadly turn out to be his final year in the NFL. In October, Kaepernick filed a lawsuit alleging collusion among league owners to keep him off the field.\n\nBut tell me again, 53 percent of white women who voted against their self-interests to nominate the racist in chief, about how Kaepernick\u2019s kneeling was un-American, after he\u2019s done more than the U.S. president for the 99 percent of us who don\u2019t benefit from the president\u2019s tax break for the wealthy.\n\nRead more at ESPN.", "keywords": ["states", "99", "espn", "nfl", "tell", "president", "million", "colin", "kaepernick", "kaepernicks", "kfc", "isnt", "united", "final"], "polarity": 0.06709876543209876, "subjectivity": 0.5960493827160492},

Kelly\u2019s music on the list of things black people say they\u2019re boycotting but still support on the down low (because, as the great pedophile purveyor of pee-pee once sang: \u201cNobody has to knoooow\u201d).\n\nMo\u2019 evoked her age, her award r\u00e9sum\u00e9, her status as a legend, the history of black women and even the civil rights struggle in her well-laid-out argument on why she considered CandyCorn Face tha God\u2019s use of \u201cdonkey\u201d disrespectful. She, unfortunately, dismantled her logic-based assertions every time she publicly referred to her husband-manager (who was on the phone) as \u201cDaddy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharlamagne tha Lawd listened intently and presented his own reasons for why he felt she deserved to be called a \u201cdonkey\u201d for overvaluing her worth as a celebrity and boycott kickstarter. The entire exchange was compelling, and both sides came away from it looking simultaneously petulant and convincing in the disagreement.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. Maybe they were both right.\n\nCharlamagne talks on the radio for a living. Besides providing a platform for Negro-hating white women, and calibrating his disdain for black women based on the amount of melanin in their skin (to be fair, long before he dismissed Amara La Negra\u2019s colorism claims, Charlamagne tha Goddamn Fool explained that \u201cwhite girls are poppin\u2019 right now\u201d), his primary job is as a shade thrower and shit starter. He does it well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo his credit, Charlie was willing to face his critics, and anything he said in their absence, he will say in their presence\u2014most famously to Birdman, who forever blessed us with a never-expiring meme when the Cash Money millionaire implored Charlamagne tha Bomb Pop face to \u201cput some respeck\u201d on his name.\n\nRegardless of my feelings about Charlamagne, some people respeck him for that. In his hometown of Moncks Corner, S.C. (the home of my mother), that is the law. You can say anything about anyone, as long as you are willing to say it to their face. He tried to explain why he called Mo\u2019Nique a donkey while she was present.\n\nAnd even though Charlamagne tha Messiah is often problematic, he didn\u2019t run. Like Erik Killmonger and people who can\u2019t stop themselves from dancing to the remix to \u201cIgnition,\u201d he handled it the wrong way, which she told him in private, after the mics were off:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever you feel about Mo\u2019Nique, it is impossible to deny her credentials. She is one of the few black female comedians to have ever entered the stratosphere of the top echelon of joke tellers\u2014black or white. Lest we forget, she has a little thing I like to call an \u201cAcademy Award.\u201d\n\n\n\nHer dispute with Netflix aside, one cannot reach the levels of success that she has achieved without talent and hard work. Her unwillingness to accept an offer that she feels devalues her as a performer and a human being shouldn\u2019t be dismissed in the equation. Whether or not anyone else feels she has overestimated her value is inconsequential.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish I had Mo\u2019Nique\u2019s level of confidence and self-value. The idea that others cannot determine the value of your work is an important lesson. Maybe she should treat people better. Maybe she isn\u2019t as funny or as popular as she and her \u201cDaddy\u201d believes (I feel like I should put my name on the sex offender\u2019s registry every time I type that), but her willingness to say \u201cFuck your couch\u201d and stand on principle is admirable.\n\nMo\u2019Nique is right. Black is often devalued because it is black. Women are often lowballed because they are women. It is difficult to live in that reality and reject it as a reason that she believes Netflix undervalued her. Even if she is wrong about Netflix, her larger point is also correct.\n\nTalent and ability mean a little less when you are black and belligerent in a Caucasian industry. Despite the fact that Ben Shapiro, Dinesh D\u2019Souza and even Milo Yiannopoulos had lucrative book deals, I\u2019m sure there won\u2019t be a bidding war for a satirical tome about white people. The probable lack of interest from publishers won\u2019t be based on numbers, analytics or a r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany of them will probably be apprehensive because, like Mo\u2019Nique and Charlamagne, I have a history of publicly pissing off white people. And I, like them, wholeheartedly believe everything I say is entertaining, honest and\u2014most important\u2014correct. But it will probably cost me. I\u2019m fine with that.\n\nI guess what I\u2019m trying to say is this:\n\nHey, my loves,\n\nBecause of discrimination and bias, I\u2019m calling for us to come together as a people and stand with me in this boycott against all books and everything white, including Apple chargers, Q-Tips and granulated sugar, until a publisher presents me with a check for $10 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI love us, for real.", "keywords": ["netflix", "alert", "tha", "answer", "monique", "wrong", "spoiler", "face", "charlamagne", "women", "black", "white", "donkey", "im", "say", "calling"], "polarity": 0.06354760006075795, "subjectivity": 0.4925099206349207},

Black women showed up and showed out in various ways. Black men put their careers and livelihoods on the line to speak out against racial injustice, police violence, and sexual assault and harassment. Creative artists experienced amazing glow ups, and black teenagers all over the country showed that no matter what, still we rise. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the biggest winners of 2017.\n\nBlack Activism\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a year that began with us getting the worst president in the world, black activists continued to do the work to help black people stay alive and get free. That activism took on many forms\u2014from protests both loud and silent to creative arts projects to writing\u2014and it was prolific in the year 2017.\n\nBlack people fought and continued to fight for clean water for the people of Flint, Mich., as well as other cities; social justice; economic justice; and an end to the state-sanctioned murder of black people at the hands of police. These fights are not over, and if 2017 was any indication, our voices will only get louder in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyonc\u00e9\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 broke the internet in February when she announced that she was pregnant with twins via an Instagram post, and her year went on an upswing that has not ended. Although we know she has plenty of haters, it\u2019s hard to understand how you can hate on someone so graceful, so beautiful, so talented and so free in her own black womanhood. Her pregnancy led to the birth of beautiful twins\u2014 which she has blessed us with time and time again. Oh, and Sir and Rumi were cute, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer charity and generosity are not always made public, but she gives from the heart when it matters most. Not to mention, her after-pregnancy snapback was real and an inspiration to us all. Deep down inside, she is just a \u201cTexas bama\u201d who has her fangirl moments just like the rest of us, and we are here for it. Long live Queen Bey.\n\nFenty Beauty\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all have our own favorite makeup brands, but when Rihanna announced that she would be launching Fenty Beauty in September, black girls (and the rest of y\u2019all) went crazy. No, she didn\u2019t make it just for us, but she made it for us in that she kept black girls in mind when creating the color ranges. The products flew off the shelves faster than they could be stocked.\n\nFenty had other beauty lines shook time and time again because Fenty had the range. Just one month in, Fenty had $72 million in earned media value, showing us that the combination of Black Girl Magic and black-girl social media capital is a guaranteed win. Right on, Fenty. Right on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack High School Seniors Accepted to College\n\nDespite being told by America every single day that their lives don\u2019t matter, black students continued to push forward and show that yes, the hell they do. Even as people tried to call them underachievers and say they are destined to a life of nothingness, black kids stood up and loudly proclaimed, \u201cYes, we can!\u201d Whether they were getting accepted to all eight Ivy League schools, heading off to Harvard or fulfilling their dream of going to their favorite HBCU, black high school seniors did the damn thing in 2017, and we are proud of y\u2019all. Keep pushing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardi B\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe don\u2019t dance no more, she makes money moves. If you look up the phrase \u201cglow up\u201d in the dictionary, right after the definition of the new vertical on The Root, there will be a picture of Cardi B, her tongue hanging out and the look of win on her face, because she seriously glowed up in 2017. Regardless of how you may feel about her, your hate and a Grammy snub won\u2019t stop her shine. She signed big deals, had one of the biggest hits of the year (my current theme song/anthem), got big props from the Queen herself\u2014and despite rumors of a potential breakup, her boo Offset proposed to her with an 8-carat diamond ring. Cardi did 2017 big as hell, and we can only expect that will continue in 2018.\n\nTerry Crews\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt takes a black man who is strong in will and mind to display restraint and not beat the shit out of a perverted white man who gropes his genitals in full view of everyone at a Hollywood party. It takes an even stronger black man to come forward during the #MeToo storm and admit that he, too, was sexually violated by a powerful white man in Hollywood. That strong black man was Terry Crews.\n\nWhile some questioned why he didn\u2019t just pummel Adam Venit when the Hollywood power broker allegedly grabbed his genitals at a party, Crews showed that it\u2019s a game of chess, not checkers, and in the end, the sound mind wins. He filed a police report, filed a lawsuit and spoke out against sexual assault in Hollywood, letting everyone know that he would not be a victim. He was named one of Time magazine\u2019s \u201csilence breakers.\u201d He dropped WME\u2014the agency Venit worked for that basically did nothing to protect Crews and everything to protect Venit\u2014and moved on to new representation, all without being the stereotypical angry black man that everyone wanted or expected him to be.\n\nThat is the very definition of winning. Kudos, Terry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarack Obama\n\nBarack Obama won 2017 the day he left office as the president of the United States. I am very sure it was like when Scarface quit his job in Half Baked.\n\nOur president started wearing less and going out more. He sent his wife a cute Valentine\u2019s Day tweet. He got crowds and applause just for being a regular-ass dude. People wanted so much more of him, the bidding war over his memoirs reached $60 million. He received the 2017 JFK Profile in Courage Award. He even reported for jury duty in Chicago. He basically showed everyone that leaving the presidency hasn\u2019t stopped his shine or his charisma, and your orange-colored Oompa Loompa of a president could never. Come through, Barack. Come through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColin Kaepernick\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNFL ratings are down, and league officials don\u2019t know what to do about it. Good. The NFL deserves whatever \u201cL\u2019s\u201d it gets because the NFL turned its back on Colin Kaepernick. Meanwhile, Kaepernick continues to shine. When he started his silent protests during the national anthem last year, he was widely criticized by people who didn\u2019t understand his need and desire to fight for black lives or the recognition he got for it. None of that matters. Despite it all, Kaepernick is living his best life. He has gotten award after award, and he is even considering buying an NFL team. Take that, NFL. Long live Colin Kaepernick.\n\nBlack Women\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2017 was the year of the black woman. From your Auntie Maxine Waters to Serena Williams winning the Australian Open while pregnant to Karen Bass\u2019 hilarious takedown of Jeff Sessions to black women showing up to guarantee Roy Moore did not win in Alabama to Tarana Burke and the #MeToo movement, black women were here for you.

Ms. Patti Patti and I try to figure out why and how the Goldilocks of racism became a thing and why Trevor Noah sent her cupcakes.

She talks about working with Pharrell Williams on the Hidden Figures soundtrack and being vocally awesome, and I had Danielle challenge her to a run-off, in which she tries to out-sing Ms. Burrell.

And the buxom, gray-eyed, Afro-rocking, melanin-poppin\u2019 recording artist is making major waves online, mostly because of the criticism surrounding her dark skin and kinky hair.\n\nBefore you check your calendar, yes, I can confirm that it is indeed 2018 and we\u2019re still talking about skin tones and hair textures not fitting into society\u2019s limited beauty standards.\n\nAmara recently appeared on The Breakfast Club, and the first question one of the show\u2019s hosts, Charlamagne tha God, asked her was, \u201cWhat are you? Racewise?\u201d I should have known from there that the interview would take an ignorant turn.\n\n\n\nOnce she said that she was Dominican and called herself an Afro-Latina, The Breakfast Club co-host DJ Envy chimed in with, \u201cWhat is Afro-Latina? I thought it was half-black and something else, half-Latina.\u201d I couldn\u2019t handle DJ Envy\u2019s views of Amara\u2019s background when he said that he thought Dominicans didn\u2019t really mess with blacks or Puerto Ricans.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want to be black and they didn\u2019t want to be Puerto Rican,\u201d DJ Envy so eloquently deduced. This guy. I\u2019m not even going to dig into that; I just wanted you to know that\u2019s something this man said ... out loud.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo which Charlamagne offered Amara, \u201cYou can say you\u2019re a Latina with an Afro.\u201d\n\nWell, gee, can I?!\n\n\n\nAmara appeared poised throughout the entire interview, during which she spoke about her (and society\u2019s) issues with colorism, some producer named Young Hollywood and why representation matters. Young Hollywood is a Love & Hip Hop: Miami castmate whose biggest claim to fame, as it stands, is his ignorant critique of Amara\u2019s image.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the show, Young Hollywood has urged Amara to consider making her look more Beyonc\u00e9 and less Macy Gray. We all know how much representation matters, and even though Love & Hip Hop: Miami may not be the most savory form of representation, you can\u2019t deny how smart the show\u2019s creator and producer, Mona Scott-Young, is for opening up this problematic dialogue to the show\u2019s demographic.\n\nColorism is a hot-button topic that many of us debate, but allowing this subject to take root in a (dare I say it) shallow pond of viewers who are mostly watching to see who splashes what in whose face is golden.\n\n\n\nI find it interesting that Amara is becoming the face of the colorism debate in the Latinx community, but I find it appalling that someone like Charlamagne tha God would ask her, \u201cYou sure it\u2019s not in your mind?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs. He. Serious?\n\n\n\nI respect Charlamagne, despite his problematic nature. The last time we spoke was in The Root\u2019s offices, where I asked him about his opinion about black women. The conversation was enlightening, to say the least, and it made me a believer in Charlamagne\u2019s mission of keeping black excellence on full display. But his thoughts on Amara\u2019s plight as a dark-skinned Dominican woman gave me pause.\n\nHe said, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard this conversation until just now.\u201d And when he went on to ask, \u201cWhat is the struggle that you\u2019re facing?\u201d I almost couldn\u2019t believe that this man who\u2019s had issues with the pigmentation of his own skin would ask this Afro-Latina woman what struggle she\u2019s facing, as if he has no idea what colorism is and how it affects people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo add insult to, well, insult, Charlamagne brought up Cardi B and her success as a measure of how far we\u2019ve come in accepting people who aren\u2019t cookie-cutter. Sure, but using Cardi B as an example in this conversation about colorism isn\u2019t valid because Cardi B isn\u2019t a dark-skinned Afro-Latina.\n\nMost of the interview was ignorant and irresponsible. It was a missed opportunity to continue a dialogue around representation and colorism in the entertainment industry on the mega platform that is The Breakfast Club.

Kimberly Foster built up For Harriet with nothing but grit and started creating regular video content. Ava DuVernay is making award-winning films and documentaries and addictive TV shows. (Editor's note: There's also Morgan Debaun, Evelyn From The Internets, Another Round, Aisha Harris's Represent podcast at Slate, my cousin sarah huny young\u2026)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyond that, there are hundreds of Black women who work their asses off to get a voice in this uber-competitive field but there\u2019s this little thing called WHITE PRIVILEGE THAT MAKES IT KINDA HARD FOR BLACK WOMEN TO RECEIVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AND CHANCES AND CHANCES TO FAIL THAT WHITE WOMEN DO.\n\n3. Charlamagne is Anti-Ciara Twitter personified\n\nCTG is the type of nigga who gets mad at a Black woman for dealing with an ain\u2019t-shit dude and also for moving on from said dude. Basically, he's chair, CEO, and majority owner of Future Hive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf a Black women rants regularly in the media, she's angry. If we move like Gs in silence like lasagna, we're not being loud enough. For men like him, we can't ever do right. (Unless you're his dermatologist. He whips out mentions of homegirl like she's the token Black best friend.)\n\nNot only do the Donkey Every Day's comments smack of ignorance, but they display the type of vitriol some Black dudes can have for Black women regardless of what we do. His original tweet\u2014which started the firestorm of clapbacks against him\u2014 wasn\u2019t an innocent observation. It was an accusation. Bruh used \u201cwoke\u201d in quotes as if we just \u201cplay-play\u201d getting angry and starting movements and marching in streets and working in non-profits for his dumbass just for shits and giggles.\n\nBoy just say you don\u2019t like Black women and gone about your day. Save them extras characters on Twitter. It'll give you more time to re-up your \"exfoliation\" regimen and fit in with the Tomis of the world. By \"exfoliation\" I mean \"whatever it is you're doing that is literally and figuratively rubbing off your blackness.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe got too many folk tryna Dolezal their way into being The African Americans, and we full.

And, while, no, Charlamagne didn\u2019t talk about killing trans women, Ashlee Marie Preston said that Charlamagne was the ringleader of Lil Duval\u2019s transphobic rhetoric on The Breakfast Club Friday morning.\n\nShe said there was no reason to ask the comedian about Donald Trump\u2019s ban on transgender troops serving in the military, which led to his using a transphobic slur that starts with a \u201ct.\u201d In addition, Lil Duval isn\u2019t particularly known for his insights on military policy. Breakfast Club co-host DJ Envy further exacerbated the drama by asking how Lil Duval would respond if a woman revealed that she was transgender after four months of dating. His reply that she would end up dead was one Charlamagne and crew surely expected.\n\n\u201cThey brought that up knowing he would have a reaction,\u201d said Preston, who staged an action against Charlamagne at Politicon in Pasadena, Calif., on Sunday. \u201cThey know we\u2019re in the age of pro-trans identity, of doing better and being decent people. So they still wanted to get that buzz when they were the ones making those statements directly. But they wanted to use Lil Duval as the voice for what they really wanted to say.\u201d\n\nThe Breakfast Club co-hosts defended themselves Monday morning, with Charlamagne defiantly saying, \u201cI\u2019m not apologizing for the words of Lil Duval.\u201d\n\nPreston said that\u2019s a cop-out. The co-hosts knew that asking the comedian about trans issues would evoke a controversial statement, making them equally accountable, she said. Preston, who is the first transgender editor in chief of the intersectional feminist magazine Wear Your Voice, is joining other trans activists in trying to force The Breakfast Club to confront what they say is its casual acceptance of transphobic behavior. Elle Hearns, founder and executive director of the Marsha P. Johnson Institute, started a petition to boycott The Breakfast Club. Raquel Willis started #TransFolksAreNotJokes on Saturday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn interviews with The Root, transgender activists said that they are organizing efforts to force iHeartRadio, the company that owns The Breakfast Club, to apologize. The petition organized by Hearns goes further, demanding that Charlamagne apologize for allowing a transphobic conversation to take place and that iHeartRadio cancel the show.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that any person who is born with any kind of consciousness could ever take joy in watching people be hurt,\u201d Hearns said. \u201cHe has a long history of anti-black rhetoric with black women. To watch black trans women be disrespected is to also watch black women be disrespected. And we\u2019ve seen that behavior from him many times before, which is why he, in particular, has become a target because of his unwillingness to acknowledge that he is wrong.\u201d\n\nWhat neither Charlamagne nor his co-hosts seem to understand is that the very passive tone of their conversation with Lil Duval creates a culture where violence against trans women is accepted, the activists told me. Human Rights Watch reports that 22 trans women have been killed in the United States so far in 2017, with most of them being trans women of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I asked if the activists would be willing to speak with Charlamagne, some of them kept that door open, citing one exception: not on his show. Giving The Breakfast Club ratings isn\u2019t something they\u2019re interested in. Besides, they say they are not very optimistic that talking to him will do that much good. Days before Lil Duval\u2019s transphobic appearance, Janet Mock spoke with the co-hosts about being transgender. A few days later, Charlamagne used her as a sexual prop for Lil Duval\u2019s sick humor by raising her name in his discussion with Duval.\n\nIn Allure, Mock spoke out against the show\u2019s treatment of her.\n\n\u201cHe was completely dismissive of that experience and allowed her to be a punch line and material for a comedian,\u201d Willis said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put myself in that situation. If it was outside of the show, if it was a panel or a discussion between us two, I would go to an event like that and be a part of that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lil Duval episode is about trans black women, but there is a larger, overarching issue concerning what they feel is Charlamagne\u2019s anti-black woman rhetoric, L\u2019lerr\u00e9t Ailith, communications director for Black Youth Project 100, told me. Charlamagne likes to project an image of wokeness, she said, given his support of the Black Lives Matter movement and his political engagement in the 2016 election, though he seems to fail when it comes to gender.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to continue to cape for Charlamagne and say he just needs to be educated,\u201d Ailith said. \u201cJanet Mock was just on his show. As she wrote in her article, she doesn\u2019t do Trans 101, but she did it for them. She went step by step, educating them on the basics of what it means to be a trans person very eloquently, and Charlamagne still refuses to take that lesson and incorporate it into his politics. I don\u2019t think he is really willing to relinquish himself the bigotry he internalized.\u201d\n\nIn December he sparked controversy when he tweeted that more black women need to build platforms like Tomi Lahren, the young white woman who used her time at TheBlaze to direct racist diatribes at black people for mass white supremacist consumption. He didn\u2019t help quell reactions from black women by having her on his show, either. Media executive Jamilah Lemieux and social-justice activist Amber Phillips appeared on his show in an attempt to explain why giving Lahren a platform was ill-advised.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, like clockwork, it appears to have done little good. Charlamagne continues to propagate anti-trans behavior, which is why the activists aren\u2019t backing down from their demands that his show be held accountable. Twitter users are continuing to upload videos of support to #TransFolksAreNotJokes. The #BreakfastClubBoycott petition is gaining stream, and Preston is planning further actions against The Breakfast Club this week.\n\nTrying to reason with Charlamagne\u2019s indignation is pointless, she said.\n\n\u201cThere need to be consequences.\u201d Preston said. \u201cIf we just tell people, \u2018You should be a better person and you should feel different,\u2019 what is that? We\u2019re still going to lose our lives. They are still going to say problematic things and reinforcing ideologies that put us in danger.

Since calendars have been around since some prehistoric cave dweller figured out that future days could be charted, I\u2019m not buying this. You\u2019re telling me this billion-dollar business didn\u2019t have the foresight to realize before now that the final Sunday-night game was on New Year\u2019s Eve?\n\n\n\nAccording to CNN, the last time the NFL aired a game on New Year\u2019s Eve was in 2006, when the Chicago Bears took on the Green Bay Packers. Here\u2019s how the news station breaks down the NFL\u2019s decision:\n\nIt was expected to be quarterback Brett Favre\u2019s last game with the Packers (and widely expected to be his last game ever). Still, only 13.4 million people watched that game, about a quarter fewer than the average Sunday Night Football game that season. Since the last Sunday night football game also happens to be the final game of the season, the NFL tries to schedule a game that will definitely have playoff implications for one or both of the teams playing. (A team that already made the playoffs might sit their starters, leading to an exceptionally boring game.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe league claims that no games met this criterion, and since it hadn\u2019t announced which teams were going to play, the NFL just decided to cut the game altogether.\n\nInstead, the league that wants some 70 percent-African-American players to risk their lives chasing a damn ball but doesn\u2019t want them to protest black death at the hands of police will run seven games at 1 p.m. and nine games at 4:25 p.m.\n\n\u201cWe felt that both from a competitive standpoint and from a fan perspective, the most fair thing to do is to schedule all Week 17 games in either the 1 p.m. or 4:25 p.m. windows,\u201d said Howard Katz, the NFL\u2019s broadcasting chief, in a prepared statement, CNN reports.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ratings for this NFL season are down 9 percent from last year, and whether it\u2019s from the #NFLblackout or white fans who just couldn\u2019t handle black protest, the ratings are tanking, and that\u2019s a good thing.\n\n\n\nRead more at CNN.", "keywords": ["football", "nfl", "sundaynight", "cnn", "teams", "week", "game", "season", "cancels", "night", "trash", "games", "league", "ratings", "final"], "polarity": -0.09533377250768559, "subjectivity": 0.4384003074220466},

South Africans were generally friendly, but I was struck by how optimistic they were about the future of the country even though apartheid had only ended, like, 15 minutes ago (1991, to be exact). I couldn\u2019t understand why they weren\u2019t more enraged and bitter. One night at dinner, I asked one of my colleagues why.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here in a restaurant that you couldn\u2019t eat at when you were 16 years old because of apartheid. That\u2019s not ancient history. That\u2019s high school. Doesn\u2019t that make you angry still?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe last \u2018Whites Only\u2019 sign was probably taken down 10 years before I was born\u2014but black Americans are still pissed about racism, past and ongoing.\u201d\n\nShe considered my question for a minute, probably thinking of a way to explain a lot of complicated history to an American outsider.\n\n\u201cWell, we got our country back,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re home; it\u2019s our land. You fought and you\u2019re still in a place that doesn\u2019t want you.\u201d\n\nThat simple conversation explains a lot about the current social media flap about conservative host Tomi Lahren, The Daily Show host Trevor Noah and radio personality Charlamagne tha God from The Breakfast Club. Sometimes our legitimate black anger doesn\u2019t let us see what\u2019s going on and blinds us to how blacks in the Diaspora view American race relations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Trevor Noah interviewed the Blaze\u2019s Tomi Lahren last week, no one predicted that it would create so many trending hot takes. Objectively, Noah\u2019s interview with Lahren was pretty good. Many of his longtime, mostly white, media critics turned away from their Jon Stewart memorial shrines long enough to praise Noah for coming into his own. Many black pundits and Twitterati did drive-by analyses of the interview after it went viral (because let\u2019s be honest; The Daily Show audience doesn\u2019t boast a regular large black viewership). The general consensus was either 1) Noah let Lahren off too easy or 2) he never should\u2019ve given her bigoted views a platform to begin with.\n\nSome of this early criticism by black Twitter wasn\u2019t exactly fair, since, unless you\u2019re a fan of his work, judging Trevor Noah\u2019s comedy and progressive chops by his one interview with Tomi Lahren is akin to judging Dave Chappelle by his \u201cGive Trump a chance\u201d monologue on Saturday Night Live and ignoring anything else he\u2019s done in comedy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA week later, when Charlamagne tha God, faux woke comedian and professional troll from the radio show The Breakfast Club, was caught playing Instagram footsie angling for an interview with Lauren, black Twitter called the Drop Squad. Suddenly Charlamagne, and Noah, were sellouts, seduced by a White She-Devil and unwittingly giving a platform to increasingly bold white supremacists in this post-Trump America.\n\nTrevor Noah, relatively new to this game, is being dragged by Twitter for something he never did.\n\nI am a huge fan of Noah\u2019s brand of political humor and have been ever since I saw the documentary about his life, You Laugh but It\u2019s True, at a film festival in 2012. Since he took over The Daily Show in 2015, his critics have accused him of, basically, not being Jon Stewart. Trevor Noah doesn\u2019t embody the East Coast white liberal outrage that other Daily Show alums like John Oliver and Samantha Bee have honed with laserlike efficiency. For black folks wanting searing racial political humor, Larry Wilmore was on Comedy Central for a year picking up the slack. Noah didn\u2019t have the burden of being both black and white America\u2019s political-comedy catharsis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of that is different now with the election of white-nationalist-sympathizing Donald Trump. Black people are legitimately scared. In this age of creeping white nationalism, if a liberal host (especially a black one) has a conservative guest, anything short of a gladiator-style verbal evisceration, followed by a slow thumbs-down and a tossing of bloody rhetorical entrails to the audience for sport, is tantamount to collusion with the enemy.\n\nBut that\u2019s not Trevor Noah\u2019s style, and it doesn\u2019t have to be. He\u2019s more Yakov Smirnoff than Paul Mooney. He\u2019s an outsider more bemused than enraged by our politics.\n\nIf there is any criticism I have of Noah in the wake of this fake controversy, it\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t spend enough time sharing how his worldview differs from the audience's. His best comedy is when he flips our flawed democracy into typical politics throughout Africa. As a child, he lived through apartheid, which was like the Batman of white supremacy; it took the best parts of racism from around the world and perfected it \u2026 at the expense of 85 percent of the population for 70 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust because Noah\u2019s comedy is more driven by the philosophy of the Truth and Reconciliation Committee than our Western notions of getting revenge and getting even doesn\u2019t make him soft on bigotry. Treating Lahren nicely after his show is no worse a crime than my South African colleagues tipping a white waiter in a restaurant that used to not serve blacks. Sometimes you show power by not letting bigots dictate your behavior.\n\nOver the next four (likely eight) years, there will be plenty of white-nationalist-sympathizing conservatives out there, and plenty of black media people who will try to suck up to them. Charlamagne tha God is a professional provocateur who thought he\u2019d get some clicks and some good trolling out of dangling a \u201cpretty white girl\u201d in front of his mostly black audience. But even he realized that he was playing himself.\n\nNoah, who perforated Lahren\u2019s bigotry for 20 minutes, shouldn\u2019t be caught in the crossfire of shade bullets aimed at Charlamagne. He\u2019s bringing good comedy and satire from a perspective that could do us some good in these coming trying times. Perhaps next time, black Twitter should listen to more than his comedy highlights before burying him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJason Johnson, political editor at The Root, is a professor of political science at Morgan State\u2019s School of Global Journalism and Communication and is a frequent guest on MSNBC, CNN, Al-Jazeera International, Fox Business News and SiriusXM Satellite Radio.

My grandmother and one of her sisters attended St. Augustine School, which was actually walking distance from their home, but Witherspoon hired a carriage and driver to take them around the corner every Sunday and return them from school on Fridays.\n\nCan you please help me to learn more about the origins of Mary Elizabeth Fogg and Hal Witherspoon? \u2014Nedra Farrar Swift\n\nThe paper trail we found on your great-grandmother Mary Elizabeth Fogg and Hal Witherspoon suggests two people who went to great lengths to be near each other during a time in American history when interracial relationships were taboo and marriage across the color line was illegal in many states. In their home state of North Carolina, whites were prohibited from marrying black or Native American people until the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Loving v. Virginia decision overturned that ban in 1967 and legalized interracial marriage nationwide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDid They Have Two Households or One?\n\nLike you, we started with census records to learn as much as we could about Hal Weatherspoon and Mary Elizabeth Fogg. One of the first things we noted is that according to census records, his first name was William and middle name Henry. Hal was clearly a nickname. Also, in various records, his surname was spelled Witherspoon or Weatherspoon.\n\nIn 1920, Mary and her son, Samuel, were residing at 719 S. East St. in Raleigh, Wake County, N.C. (via FamilySearch; free registration required). Directly next door at 721 S. East St. lived Wm. Henry Weatherspoon, who was born about 1859 at North Carolina. This census recorded that Mary was born in Georgia about 1868 and was a widow. Keep in mind that \u201cwidow\u201d was often a term used on census records for women who had been abandoned by their husbands or perhaps had never married but had children, which, based on your family story, may be the case in this situation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTen years later, William H. Weatherspoon and Mary Elizabeth Fogg were recorded as neighbors in Raleigh, Wake County, N.C. William H. was 71 years old, placing his birth about 1859 at North Carolina. Mary Elizabeth was 55 years old, placing her birth about 1875. This census also tells you that William H. owned his home and that Mary Elizabeth rented her home, possibly from Hal, based on the proximity. The marital status of each suggests a previous relationship for both parties, with William H. recorded as divorced and Mary Elizabeth recorded as a widow. Mary\u2019s son, Samuel K. Fogg, born about 1903, was also residing in her household.\n\nIn 1940, William H. Weatherspoon was still residing on South East Street in Raleigh, Wake County, N.C., though Mary Elizabeth Fogg is not recorded anywhere near him. William was recorded as being born about 1859 at North Carolina and was divorced, which matched the other records we located for him.\n\nWe located a death record for W. Hal Weatherspoon on March 8, 1943, at Raleigh, Wake County, N.C. The record states that he was born in January 1859 at Wake County and that his parents were Benjamin Weatherspoon and Carolina Barber. His address at the time of his death was 721 S. East St., and he was buried at the City Cemetery in Raleigh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe searched the Wake County Grantors Index for a land record that might mention the land he left to his children, but we did not locate a transfer of land from William Hal Witherspoon. Working the other direction, we also did not locate a deed in which a person with the surname \u201cFogg\u201d received land from anyone with the surname \u201cWitherspoon.\u201d Since the land transfer was not recorded in a deed, you will likely want to search for a probate record for William Hal Weatherspoon, since he may have bequeathed the property in his will.\n\nWe tried to work backward in time, too. We located Mary E. Fogg residing at 719 S. East St., Raleigh, in 1910 with her children, Bessie, David and Samuel, but William Hal Witherspoon is not residing in or near the household. We know from other records that this is an address associated with him, so perhaps Mary and her children were residing on his property.\n\nWe could not locate William Hal Weatherspoon in the 1910 census in Wake County, regardless of how we searched. It could be that his name was transcribed into a database incorrectly, so you may want to browse the census page by page for anyone around Mary Elizabeth Fogg who could be William Hal Witherspoon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Possible Origin of a Familiar Name\n\nWith the information about William Hal Witherspoon\u2019s mother from his death record, we located him residing with his mother, Caroline Weatherspoon, at 719 S. East St. in 1900. It is very likely that your grandmother Caroline \u201cCarrie\u201d Fogg was named for William Hal\u2019s mother. This record again records that William Hal was divorced. His mother, Caroline, was born in November 1829 at North Carolina and had borne four children, three of which were still living in 1900, meaning that William Hal had siblings you could investigate further to learn more about the family. That same year, Mary Elizabeth Fogg was residing at East Cabarrus Street in Raleigh, very close to South East Street. She had six children living with her, including your grandmother Carrie, though the record states she had eight children living.\n\nWilliam Hal resided with his mother as a young man as well. In 1880 he was 21 years old and living in the household of his mother, Caroline Weatherspoon, in South East Raleigh, Wake County. It seems likely that Hal remained on the same location his entire life, perhaps on the same property. We located a Mary Fogg that year who was a single mother of two young children: Annie Fogg, born about 1876, and Delman Dewight, born about 1879. She is in the right place and of the right age to be your Mary Fogg, and both children would have been old enough in 1900 to have resided outside of her home. Given that Delman has a different surname, this may be a child from a previous relationship prior to her relationship with William Hal Witherspoon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorking further back, we located William Hal as an infant in the household of Simpson Weatherspoon at the North Western District of Wake County, N.C., with his mother, Caroline. Though William Hal\u2019s death record named his father as \u201cBenjamin,\u201d it seems likely that this is the right family and that perhaps Simpson went by a middle name or that by the time of William Hal\u2019s death, the name had been remembered by the informant incorrectly. This record includes two elder sisters for William: Eliza and Nora.\n\nThere is a marriage record for Simpson Weatherspoon and Caroline Barly in Wake County, N.C., on July 4, 1850. As newlyweds, the couple were residing with Clarky Barby in Wake County in 1850. Because Barby or Barbee is a family name in Wake County, it is likely that her surname in her marriage record was a poorly written \u201cBarby.\u201d This gives you yet another generation to search for more information.\n\nWe were unable to definitively take Mary E. Fogg\u2019s line back any further, but you will want to investigate three close matches to her description in the 1870 U.S. census to see if you can determine which one may be her. To do this, trace the families forward to see if you can find one of these Mary Foggs living somewhere when you have a record of your Mary Fogg living elsewhere. This will mean that you can rule them out as a possible match. Anyone you cannot trace forward may be your Mary Fogg and could help you uncover another generation on your Fogg family tree.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Complicated Question of Mary Fogg\u2019s Identity\n\nAs for whether your great-grandmother was \u201c100 percent Cherokee,\u201d the only records we located for Mary Elizabeth Fogg identify her race only as black or \u201cmulatto.\u201d Since race in census records was often determined by the census taker, this could just be due to a judgment based on the pigment of her skin. However, it could also mean that she was not self-identifying as Cherokee.\n\nAn additional explanation is possible: As we noted in our previous column \u201cWhere Did My Infamous Ancestor Come From?\u201d a 1910 petition by the Croatan Indians of Sampson County, N.C. (roughly 70 miles from Wake County, where Mary Fogg lived), reveals that the white population in the area commonly classified members of the Native population as being black. Read Stacey Ricketts\u2019 posting of \u201cThe Mulatto Classification of Indian Families and Related Laws\u201d for more context.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith that in mind, we noted a number of people with the surname Fogg included on Cherokee Enrollment records. Many of the applications include detailed interviews about their families and where they originated. We did not locate anyone named Mary mentioned in the few records we reviewed, and it appears that some of these Foggs were from Arkansas, a location we have never seen associated with your Mary Elizabeth Fogg. However, we suggest that you closely examine the records yourself to see if you can find any family details that may connect to your Mary Elizabeth Fogg.\n\nWe also suggest that you take an autosomal DNA test to determine if you have Native American ancestry, if you have not already. These tests are available through companies such as 23andMe, Family Tree DNA and Ancestry.com.\n\nFurthermore, if you identify and connect with living descendants of William Hal Witherspoon\u2019s siblings and they are willing to have their DNA tested (or share the results of DNA tests they have already taken), you could confirm the family connection. The aforementioned companies currently also offer autosomal DNA cousin matching. If you have blood relatives in the Witherspoon family, their DNA may already be in the databases of one or more of these services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHenry Louis Gates Jr. is the Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and founding director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard University.

Congrats!\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s say you just started a new job, or maybe your kid made a new friend at school, or perhaps some black people even just moved into your neighborhood, and now you want to make nice with them. Cool. You\u2019re trying to make friends with black people, but you\u2019ve never really made friends with black people. I mean, you\u2019ve known some black people throughout your life, but never enough to really call them \u201cfriends.\u201d\n\nBut these black people, they\u2019re different. You feel a kinship, a connection, a bond. You feel like you want to really get to know them, have them be a part of your life and truly open up to them.\n\nHow do you do it?\n\n\n\nHow do you cross the uncomfortable divide of race and culture and make a genuine connection with your new black friend (hopefully) without it getting weird?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorry not, because we\u2019re here to help. For you as a not-black person trying to ingratiate yourself with the soul and get you properly down with the browns. If you are black, you can print this out for your new white friends as a quick read to help cultivate your burgeoning friendship.\n\nI wonder if they know the other black person that I know; should I ask them?\n\nProbably not, for two reasons. The first being that it\u2019s a dead giveaway that you do not know many black people, if any, and that you have no idea just how many black people there are (hint: There are 47 million of us in America). Second, it\u2019s a weak way to start up a conversation, and it lets us know you assume that we don\u2019t have any other mutual interests beyond, well, beyond the fact that we both know some black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSurprisingly, you\u2019ve got a lot more in common with the black folks around you than you think. We all eat food, we all got families and we all watch Game of Thrones (yo, black people love some Thrones, y\u2019all). So start there instead of dragging Sheila from accounts payable at your old job into this relationship.\n\n(Sidenote: We think we know Sheila, though. I mean, we probably do. She sounds mad familiar, but don\u2019t just jump to conclusions about that shit, man. It\u2019s not cool.)\n\n\n\nShould I tell them about the black person I dated briefly in college?\n\nPlease don\u2019t.\n\nDo we have to talk about race all the time?\n\nIf it makes you uncomfortable, yes. Yes, we do, for that reason.\n\nDid you watch that O.J. Simpson 30 for 30 documentary?\n\nHell yeah! That shit was great. Man, there hasn\u2019t been an exploration into the intersections of race, class, celebrity and the fault lines of the criminal-justice system like that in the history of television.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI mean, white people who like The Wire get props in our book, but if you actually watched that O.J. doc and really and genuinely walked away from it with some informed understanding of how African Americans view the police and our historic relationship with law enforcement, then more power to you. That\u2019s worth a solid fist bump with a lower lip bite, homey.\n\nSee, THAT\u2019S how you let us know where you stand on things. Don\u2019t just come at O.J. like he was some kind of savage or unrepentant murderer who just indiscriminately killed people on a whim. There\u2019s a whole story there.\n\nBut do you think that O.J. did it?\n\nOh yeah, he totally did that shit.\n\nI voted for Trump. How do I talk about this with my new black friend?\n\nNah.\n\nDon\u2019t.\n\nYou\u2019re probably not ready for a black friend right now. Just back away from black people and deal with your own shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo everyone who voted for Trump is a racist?\n\nIf you aren\u2019t, then you\u2019re OK with racism. You were cool with the prospect of racism perniciously impacting people you now want to call friends. Racist shit wasn\u2019t a disqualifying factor for you, sooooo \u2026\n\nI\u2019m having a dinner party at my house. What should I ask them to bring?\n\nMacaroni and cheese. Trust me. Black people excel in the macaroni arts. That or potato salad if you plan on having it served. Otherwise, we won\u2019t eat the potato salad, and your macaroni game is gonna come up short.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlay to your black friend\u2019s strengths. In fact, you should plan the meal in anticipation of some bomb-ass macaroni and work from there. If your new black friend makes shitty macaroni, chances are they don\u2019t have many black friends, either, and y\u2019all were never gonna work out anyway.\n\nThey\u2019ve invited me over to a barbecue. What should I bring?\n\nThis one\u2019s dicey because, in your mind, you\u2019re probably thinking that you should answer their call as if it\u2019s some kind of cultural exchange where you\u2019ll have some of their native dishes and you\u2019ll bring one of yours in kind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t do that.\n\nWhen it comes to how the food is seasoned, prepared, cooked and presented, you gotta really have a thorough understanding of the black folks you\u2019re dealing with before you just start showing up with random shit. Is this a pork house or a nonpork house? Are they cool with coleslaw? Is this a Hennessy or a Remy family? Too many variables, man. Don\u2019t chance it. Besides, they\u2019re going to ask you to bring a nonperishable item to keep it simple for you, so chances are you\u2019re getting plates anyway.\n\n\n\nBut if you do start feeling inspired and want to make your Oma\u2019s special-recipe green-bean-and-wheat salad, stop. Don\u2019t bring that shit. No one\u2019s gonna touch it because we\u2019re not that polite.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext thing you know, the party\u2019s over and there\u2019s a whole uneaten casserole sitting on the counter and you done hurt your own feelings. Just bring cups and napkins. Black folks love napkins. You can never go wrong with napkins \u2026 or ice, \u2019cause we know Marvin an\u2019nem always forget that shit.\n\nWhen do I get to use the n-word?\n\nNever. The answer is never. Not even if you stay friends for the next 55 years and find yourselves sitting next to each other in the home whilst Wu-Tang plays in the background of your bingo game. It\u2019s \u201cShame on a nuh\u201d for you forever. Forever.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you want to keep your black friend, don\u2019t ever use that word.\n\nI don\u2019t see race, so why should I treat my black friend(s) any differently?\n\nSee, that\u2019s where you fucked up from the jump. Anybody who cops the \u201cI don\u2019t see race\u201d plea is immediately suspect to all black people. Saying that you don\u2019t see race is essentially admitting that you\u2019re so willing to deny your own biases that you\u2019ll revoke part of someone else\u2019s identity to make you feel better about your inadequacies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t believe me? Allow me to put it another way.\n\nWould you trust a doctor who said they didn\u2019t see or believe in cancer? Hell nah, you wouldn\u2019t. Anybody who denies that an illness exists is immediately disqualified from treating said illness. So if you\u2019re trying to be our white friend but ignore our blackness, how you gonna stand on our side when we actually have to confront racism?\n\nYou can\u2019t and you won\u2019t because you\u2019re choosing your own comfort over our struggle. We\u2019ll never really be friends, but we will let you order the fight and bring five of our other black-that-you-don\u2019t-see homies to your crib with one six-pack between us and pillage your snack table off GP.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t take black folks for granted, and we won\u2019t have to take you to task.", "keywords": ["youve", "friends", "bring", "dont", "youre", "know", "race", "person", "really", "black", "guide", "friend", "decided", "beginners", "shit"], "polarity": 0.022966471753785193, "subjectivity": 0.47086954297775147},

Maxine Waters: Breaker of Chains, Reclaimer of Time\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter having to suffer the devastating dishonor of having an orange buffoon in the White House, black people have pretty much been fed up since before 2017. And no person illustrated this \u201cfed-uppedness\u201d more than longtime career politician Rep. Maxine Waters.\n\n\n\nMadame Waters (D-Calif.) was, quite frankly, the mood of 2017. From her hilarious and biting tweets to her determination to see Donald Trump impeached, she simply had no fucks to give. And the greatest example of this was when her legitimate question about 45\u2019s financial ties to Russia was interrupted by wayward Caucasian American Steven Mnuchin. The deflection did not deter her and she instead repeated \u201cReclaiming my time\u201d over and over again until he eventually shut the fuck up.\n\nShe\u2019s a boss. You know it. I know it. And 2017 knew it.\n\n2. Michelle Obama and the Side Eye Seen\u2019t Around the World\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch despair was felt through the force when it was announced that Agent Orange was gonna waltz his baked-Cheeto, dusty ass into the White House. And while that was bad enough, most of us couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how little time we had left to spend with the Obamas. So imagine our surprise when Michelle Obama gifted us with enough side eye during Inauguration Day to help us power through the rest of 2017.\n\nYes, before she would walk into the sunset with her beloved Barack and say goodbye to us forever, our good sis Michelle gave the best side eye ever after getting a gift from Melania and listening to all the Inauguration Day malarkey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was her final act as first lady. And what an act it was.\n\n3. Anika Noni Rose Lovingly Encouraging Cicely Tyson at the Emmys\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have a love-hate relationship with the Emmys, mostly based on how Caucasian the nomination lineups are for the night. However, I luckily caught a few moments from the 2017 Emmys. And I\u2019m glad I did because had I not, I would have missed one of the greatest moments in Black Girl Magic history.\n\n\n\nThe moment includes both Anika Noni Rose and Cicely Tyson going up to announce the winner for Outstanding Limited Series. The immortal Tyson paused right before recalling her role in Roots, and instead of awkwardly standing there until Tyson remembered, Rose leaned over and whispered an encouragement in Tyson\u2019s ears.\n\n\n\nIt was one of the simplest yet greatest acts of black sisterhood and solidarity that I had seen in a while. And in a year that was as brutal as 2017, it was sorely needed.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. World Stop: Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Pregnancy Announcement\n\nGreatness begets greatness. I don\u2019t know who said that, and I don\u2019t care to ask, but just know that it has been and always will be applied to Her Majesty King Beyonc\u00e9, First and Only of Her Name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter having a fantastic year in 2016, Beyonc\u00e9 blew our black minds when she surprise-announced her pregnancy on Instagram with the radiance and grace of a black Madonna. And while gracing us with her otherworldliness, she managed to piss off white women and white conservatives and inspire low-budget Great Value copycats in one wild swoop.\n\nNever change, Bey. Never change.\n\n5. Black Twitter Gathering Kendall Jenner\u2019s Edges Over That Pepsi Commercial\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlenty of black folx had a fantastic year. Cardi B had a fantastic year. Issa Rae had a phenomenal year. Rihanna had a spectacular year. New Edition had an amazing year. And Tiffany Haddish had an astounding year.\n\n\n\nThe list of black people laughing in the face of 2017 is very long. But such a list would be incomplete without the collective that is Black Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Twitter has been a respected entity for a while now. But it truly cemented itself as a cultural force for change when it single-handedly got Kendall Jenner\u2019s tone-deaf-ass Pepsi commercial yoinked from the TV airwaves. Indeed, Jenner thought she was doing all of us a favor by throwing some dusty Party City wig at a fellow sista in the commercial (an apt self-dragging of white feminism) before hijacking black and brown traditions of protest, and Black Twitter, of course, said, \u201cNot today, Satan.\u201d\n\n\n\nCombine this with other cultural moments like spurring on (along with Black Tumblr) Netflix to make that Rihanna-Lupita Nyong\u2019o Heist movie, penned by Issa Rae and directed by Ava DuVernay, a reality and exposing the hell out of Keaton Jones\u2019 white supremacist family, and it is very clear that Black Twitter is here to stay and suffers no fools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Black Women in Alabama Telling Roy Moore, \u201cYou Thought!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou probably notice how I keep mentioning that 2017 was a tough-ass year. This is most certainly true, especially politically.\n\nSince the Over-Inflated Tangerine was voted into office by white women, it\u2019s been a yearlong battle to make sure that our legislators, quite frankly, do not kill us. This has been true concerning the Affordable Care Act, the GOP tax plan, net neutrality and so much more. So you can say, politically, we really needed a win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd black women gave us exactly that in the election battle between Roy Moore and Doug Jones for a U.S. Senate seat representing Alabama.\n\nThe choice was between an accused child-molesting, homophobic bigot and a Democrat, Doug Jones, and white people almost purposely screwed the pooch again by voting in the alleged child molester because he was \u201ccloser to God\u201d (cue an eye roll). Of course, black women did not allow this to pass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a nod to the 94 percent who showed us they had common sense during the general election, and it proved that, yes, even states like Alabama (where black people live, too, Bernie Sanders) can have competitive elections if given the fucking chance.\n\nBlack women, I salute you. Truly.\n\n7. It Ain\u2019t Over Till It\u2019s Over: Moonlight\n\nIn that same vein, 2017 must have been the year of \u201cHold up, wait a minute,\u201d because not only did black people pull off the upset in Alabama this year, but we managed to pull it off during Oscar season, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this year, La La Land was heavily projected to win the Oscar for Best Picture over Moonlight, and despite all the queer black people everywhere giving Goku our energy for a spirit bomb, it looked like La La Land would indeed win. And that much was confirmed when B(La)h B(La)h Land was crowned winner.\n\nThat is ... until it was un-crowned.\n\nIn one of the most confusing moments of 2017, La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz snatched the card from the dazed and confused presenter and clarified that it was Moonlight that had actually won Best Picture. I\u2019m always gonna wonder who I need to drag for low-key stealing Moonlight\u2019s moment, but this should be a lesson to us as a people that it is not over until we say it\u2019s over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Colin Kaepernick Has the Last Laugh\n\nColin Kaepernick\u2019s long, hard-fought battle to call out police brutality and systemic injustice started out in 2016 when he, a San Francisco 49ers quarterback at the time, sat down during the playing of the national anthem at a preseason game versus the Green Bay Packers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, the football player and activist has been the center of an intense, national debate on racial and social injustice, and because he continued to walk and talk the talk, the powers that be decided that Kaepernick would enter the year as an unsigned free agent, despite being more talented than plenty of other current quarterbacks (*stares at Jay Cutler*).\n\n\n\nAnd these racist NFL owners probably had a good chuckle over it all ... until it was announced that Kaepernick was suing the shit out of all of them, of course.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only did Kaepernick decide to bring a case against them, but he also went on to become GQ\u2019s Citizen of the Year, and he\u2019s currently mulling over the prospect of maybe owning the Carolina Panthers alongside Diddy and Steph Curry.\n\nClearly, Kaepernick is just getting started.\n\n9. Black People Do Do Horror: On Get Out Being a Success\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn times of trial and tribulation, black art has risen like a phoenix and thrived in the face of uncertainty, and Get Out was certainly not an exception this year.\n\n\n\nJordan Peele\u2019s directorial debut and smash hit changed the game forever this year.\n\nNot only did it make bank with a film budget that sounded like the movie-producing equivalent of $3, but its biting social commentary on racial relations in America presented in the horror genre reminded us of how multifaceted black people are and how it\u2019s about damn time that black creatives get to flex our muscles in genre movies (another great example of this is Dee Rees\u2019 Mudbound, which no doubt counts as a Western/period piece).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd not even the Golden Globes\u2019 outdated genre system can take this win away from us.\n\n10. LeBron James Calling Donald Trump by His Name: \u201cBum\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the year when white people continued to show their asses and black people made a conscious and collective decision to stop giving a singular fuck, no such person illustrated this big mood quite like LeBron R. James.\n\nJames, a three-time NBA champ, has proved time and time again that he doesn\u2019t concern himself with the opinions of sheep, but he took this attitude to the next level when the Expired Squash got in his Twitter feelings about Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors\u2019 declining his booty-ass invite to visit the White (Supremacist) House.\n\nTrump was about five more seconds from going full Mean Girls on Curry (which included uninviting them) when James became sick of the bullshit and fired off the tweet heard around the world:\n\nHe called 45 a \u201cbum.\u201d\n\nThe legendary tweet is still on James\u2019 Twitter page. To this day. And I am hoping that it continues to serve as a visible reminder that black people from all walks of life are never too busy to speak truth to power and call a spade a spade. All while having a good and necessary laugh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s that on that.", "keywords": ["la", "2017", "twitter", "land", "kaepernick", "tyson", "women", "black", "white", "won", "moments"], "polarity": 0.10843534659042689, "subjectivity": 0.4960628438703303},

She says abhorrent and hateful things, and has leveraged this abhorrence and hate to give herself a larger platform to infect more people with it and make more money off of it. She is willfully and dangerously ignorant, is either unaware of or unconcerned with historical context, and also seems to have no problem inciting violence against people protesting and brutalized by it. If Heaven exists \u2014 and I believe it does \u2014 and what we believe to be true about Heaven is actually true, if she died today she would not be there tomorrow.\n\nShe is also young, petite, and very blonde; characteristics that, in tandem, are considered by very many people to be the three most desirable things a woman can be. If she appeared on screen and the TV happened to be on mute and you happened to not be paying much attention to it, you could easily mistake her for Kristen Bell or Emilia Clarke.\n\nThis \u2014 her appearance and youth and physical presence \u2014 seems to be incongruent with who she actually is. It's not at all, of course. She is, again, a terrible fucking person. (Do not forget this.) But everything America encourages us to believe about how terrible and dangerous people are supposed to look and sound (not like Tomi Lahren) and the type of people people who look like Tomi Lahren are supposed to be (not terrible and dangerous) suggests otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis particular strain of socialization also ignores history. Tomi Lahrens are directly responsible for false arrests, beatings, whippings, lynchings, and even executions. If you watch the footage of Ruby Bridges desegregating William Frantz Elementary, or Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford, Jefferson Thomas, Terrence Roberts, Carlotta Walls LaNier Minnijean Brown, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Thelma Mothershed, and Melba Pattillo Beals desegregating Little Rock Central High, you'll see dozens of Tomi Lahrens on the front lines, clutching signs, hurling stones, and spewing hate; their pretty little blonde fucking faces twisted, evil, and cruel.\n\nBut their looks have granted them the privilege of consideration. Sometimes even kindness. (And sometimes even cupcakes.) Because women that young, that blonde, that petite just can't possibly also be that hateful. It's unfathomable that they could genuinely be this vile and wicked. So maybe a conversation might sway them. Or an invitation to a show. Or a hug. Or a drink. Or a date even. Or a dick inside of them. Or, shit, maybe even having a kid with them might do it. It never does, of course. Never, ever, ever, ever, ever. But that doesn't stop us from trying. (If it's not obvious already, \"us\" in this context is \"Black men.\")\n\nWhile both history and the present inform us that we should be impervious to whichever charms we believe they possess \u2014 that our lives can literally depend on refusing to be seduced by them \u2014 we still allow it to happen. We still want to acknowledge and engage them. We still want to be nice to them. Perhaps with the hope that they'll acknowledge and engage us in return. But all this does is validate them. It gives them credibility for engaging us; which, in the eyes of their friends and fans and followers, is effectively and bravely slumming. It promotes their brands and boosts their platforms. It buys them more airtime and unlimited bleach. It provides them an alibi for their hate. Because Tomi Lahren can't really be racist if she's getting drinks with Trevor and mean mugging with Charlamagne.

The entire thing had moved way, way beyond that. It had gone tribal, to use a jail metaphor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI credit Ezra Edelman and his seminal O.J.: Made in America documentary for giving me empathy for Brown Simpson. As noted in his The Root 100 bio last year:\n\nMade in America took one of the most specific, racially divisive trials of the 20th century and expanded its lens beyond Simpson and onto celebrity, criminal justice, race and gender in Los Angeles.

He was a living representation of a criminal-justice system that has doled out relentless travesty to African Americans since time immemorial (\u201cTwo for 2 million?\u201d is how one black woman put it).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIntersectionality is rarely neat.\n\nI\u2019m over it. O.J. is nothing but spectacle, and we have quite enough of that in reality. What\u2019s next? O.J. Simpson endorses Donald Trump? O.J. gets in a ring with Trump after he\u2019s impeached?

Diddy\u201d Combs and Colin Kaepernick\u2019s interest in purchasing the Carolina Panthers appears to be far more legitimate than a couple of boastful tweets. Kaepernick and Combs have already discussed the role that the former quarterback might play in Combs\u2019 new-look NFL team. And Combs has also begun reaching out to other wealthy individuals about forming an ownership group.\n\n\n\nThese two definitely want to own and operate an NFL team, but they have some major obstacles in their way. Most notably: Kaepernick is not the most popular guy right now among NFL executives, and while Diddy might be the richest rapper on the planet, his net worth of just over $800 million pales in comparison with the wealth of the many multibillionaires who own NFL teams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Panthers\u2019 estimated net worth is $2.5 billion, and the controlling share that Combs and Kaepernick are interested in buying should cost around $1.3 billion. Panthers owner Jerry Richardson is putting his controlling ownership up for sale following sexual-misconduct allegations against him. Combs and Kaepernick alone can\u2019t purchase Richardson\u2019s shares, so these two will need to get creative if they are to create a viable proposal.\n\nI\u2019m sure that Combs knows enough rich people to cobble together the funds, but the NFL prefers owners who can purchase teams without outside help. Also, he\u2019s not bringing on Kaepernick if he wants to merely create a new revenue stream. Combs obviously wants his team to stand for something. Kaepernick has already told Combs that he\u2019d like the Panthers\u2019 front office to resemble more closely the demographics of NFL players, which is 70 percent African American.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo in this vein of needing to build an innovative ownership structure and wanting to build a football team that is more than just a football team, I think Combs and Kaepernick should look across the Atlantic and apply the approach of one of the world\u2019s greatest soccer teams: F.C. Barcelona.\n\nF.C. Barcelona\u2019s ownership and organizational structure depend on the club\u2019s members. (F.C. stands for \u201cF\u00fatbol Club.\u201d) Barcelona, just like countless other soccer clubs, has always relied on membership for survival. These international and incredibly lucrative soccer teams in many cases started as local athletic clubs that needed membership dues to stay afloat. As soccer has become more lucrative, the financial dependence on membership dues has decreased, but the importance of membership has not.\n\nMembers keep the club rooted in their community, and members have various levels of authority within a soccer club. At Barcelona, members elect the president who will run the club. When election season comes, businessmen from all across the city declare their candidacy. They run campaigns and even promise to sign specific players if they are elected. Barcelona\u2019s archrival Real Madrid has a similar structure, and during one particularly contentious election season, Florentino Perez, a candidate for Real Madrid\u2019s presidency, promised to buy Barcelona\u2019s best player\u2014at the time, Luis Figo\u2014if he won. To his surprise, and especially Figo\u2019s, he won, and Figo forever became persona non grata to all Barcelona fans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt other clubs, members can select representatives to conduct discussions with the top brass of the soccer club. These representatives may not have official power inside the club, but they provide the voice of the fan base to management. And this helps clubs best serve their members.\n\nThe potential Combs-and-Kaepernick Panthers haven\u2019t even solidified their organizational structure, so talk of elections might be premature, but membership and membership dues could be an amazing way to raise the funds to buy the team.\n\nAnd while membership could be a new-look approach to fundraising for American football, which European teams have used for over a century, the biggest lesson from F.C. Barcelona could be that team\u2019s commitment to being more than just a soccer club. Its slogan is \u201cMes que un club,\u201d or \u201cmore than a club,\u201d and F.C. Barcelona legitimately views itself as a symbol of Spain\u2019s Catalan culture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis year the soccer club has had a significant role in providing a voice for the Catalan people as they discussed their potential independence from Spain, and this is only one of many examples of how this club has become an essential voice in Spanish politics.\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, F.C. Barcelona became a symbol of strength for the Catalan people as they fought against Gen. Francisco Franco. In addition, the Catalan region of Spain speaks Catalan and not Castilian Spanish, and the soccer club has always been a de facto representative of the Catalan language.\n\nF.C. Barcelona even has a page on its official website explaining the importance of its members in forming the identity of the club, as well as the club\u2019s four pillars: Catalan identity, universality, social commitment and democracy. F.C. Barcelona has over 170,000 members.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Combs and Kaepernick employ Barcelona\u2019s model, they could revolutionize the NFL for the better. Sports and politics are becoming more interwoven by the day, so we need to incorporate models that can allow this dynamic in order to thrive.\n\n\n\nCurrently, Combs and Kaepernick want to promote a social justice and racial-equity message on the field and in the front office, and membership will allow them to do so throughout their entire fan base. And by being \u201cmore than a club,\u201d they could attract members who actually support other teams but love their message. Membership could be as little as $20 a year, and it shouldn\u2019t have any tiers. All members are equal. I\u2019m from Atlanta and support the Falcons, but I\u2019d pay $20 to become a member of the Combs-and-Kaepernick Panthers. I bet a lot of other African Americans would, too.\n\nAlso, we can\u2019t forget that the Panthers\u2019 current owner is selling his shares because he\u2019s been accused of sexual misconduct, so incorporating gender equality and combating domestic violence into the stated ethos of the new-look Panthers should be a given.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrently, my guess is that it\u2019s a long shot for Combs and Kaepernick to control the Panthers, so they need to make their appeal about something more than just money. This team needs to be structured in a way that can benefit society. Most likely, the NFL will reject anything these two send its way, but at least this strategy would put the NFL in a difficult position.\n\nImagine if Combs and Kaepernick quickly established a membership base of well over 100,000, with each fan committed to giving $20 a year. If the NFL rejected this proposal, it would have openly rejected social justice, racial equity, gender equality and an elevated fan involvement so that it could keep the white-dominated status quo that denies minorities a seat at the table.\n\nThe idea of Combs and Kaepernick owning an NFL team is a bold move, and in order for them to see it through, they need an equally bold vision.", "keywords": ["panthers", "bold", "diddy", "nfl", "colin", "kaepernick", "combs", "kaepernicks", "carolina", "soccer", "membership", "club", "barcelona", "team", "members", "plan", "strategy"], "polarity": 0.17559574382004284, "subjectivity": 0.46491416164313354},

(Sidenote: How does a video vixen retire? Does she turn in her performance thong and wedges? Just wondering.)\n\n\n\nSomehow, unbeknownst to any black person with a high school diploma or an equivalency degree, O.J. became the symbolic embodiment of black people, as far as white people were concerned. Maybe it was because he wanted so badly to be appreciated by them; maybe it was because during his trial on charges of killing Nicole Simpson and Goldman, black America embraced O.J. in a way that even took O.J. aback. Truthfully, what black America was embracing was an opportunity to challenge a racist, oppressive judicial system that continuously feeds on black and brown bodies, and O.J. just happened to be in the right place at the right time.\n\nBut on this Thursday, on this day of Our Lord and Savior Stephen Curry, let me let white folks in on a little secret: Black folks don\u2019t fuck with O.J. Truthfully, we never really did. In fact, we didn\u2019t care if O.J. served 200 years inside the sunken place, inside a boot that was placed squarely up his own ass.

In fact, we were taking bets on whether Orenthal J. Simpson was going to walk out a free man after serving almost nine years in prison for, get this, taking his own shit back!\n\nI know that the law calls this stealing, but what has always been troubling to me is how someone can steal O.J.\u2019s stuff, which the men who were robbed admitted to doing; then O.J. not only finds out that the stuff is stolen but goes to get it back, and the state awards him all the items, which he reportedly \u201cstole,\u201d but O.J. still gets 33 years in prison. That\u2019s ultimate white justice. Black folks knew that this was payback for the acquittal on the murder charges. And soon, O.J. will be free, which means he will go back to being O.J., and, sadly, he\u2019s black America\u2019s George Zimmerman, but more charming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, during his parole hearing, which was televised, O.J. reached into his Naked Gun acting trick bag to pull out a few moves that would make young Denzel, before the big-teeth memes, jealous. O.J. was affable and funny and remorseful and convincing. He was dinner-party O.J. at his finest because O.J. can\u2019t stop O.J.-ing, which means I give him three days after his release before he\u2019s caught on a TMZ video saying some freakishly dumb shit. I give him a few weeks before he\u2019s on the golf course, and a few years before O.J. is back in jail because the one telling sign that O.J. hasn\u2019t changed one bit came when he was drilled on whether or not he attended Alcoholics Anonymous classes as instructed during his last parole hearing in 2013.\n\nO.J. waxed on about being a Christian and how he hadn\u2019t gone to AA but had found other classes that he thought were better, like conflict resolution. Point is: O.J. is still doing whatever the fuck O.J. wants to do, and we\u2019ve seen how it turns out when he\u2019s left to his own devices.", "keywords": ["shocked", "fact", "manages", "prison", "hes", "folks", "video", "black", "white", "simpson", "oj", "america", "parole", "trumps"], "polarity": 0.01740761653805132, "subjectivity": 0.43302136269527586},

Jermaine Shoemake is the self-proclaimed \u201cPrince of Pan-Africanism\u201d who goes by that name. A blood relative of Frederick Douglass, he is a school psychologist who travels the country lecturing on the education of black boys, African culture and the need for African-centered education. He donates most of his time to raising money so that he can open a school for black boys.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat sounds incredible!\n\nIndeed it does, except that none of the shit in that previous paragraph is true.\n\nWait ... what?\n\nFor starters, no one has been able to find any evidence that Jermaine Shoemake (or Umar\u2014the name he gave himself) has a doctoral degree. Either he is lying about his Ph.D. in psychology, or he matriculated at the same educational institution as Dr. Dre, Dr. J and Nasir Jones, who achieved his advanced degree in 1999 and proudly proclaimed himself \u201cDr. Knockboot.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter his Breakfast Club appearance, someone on Twitter did offer a valid explanation for Shoemake\u2019s claims:\n\nWhy would Frederick Douglass\u2019 grandnephew do this?\n\nBecause that was a lie, too. While it is impossible to confirm that no Douglass blood flows through Shoemake\u2019s veins, in 2016 the descendants of Douglass issued a statement:\n\nThe family of Frederick Douglass has received numerous inquiries about Umar Johnson questioning his relationship to Frederick Douglass. There have also been questions about the legitimacy of his PhD and handling of the donations he\u2019s received for a school he is promoting. We can tell you with 100% certainty that he is not a descendant of Frederick Douglass. With that being said, Mr. Johnson is very careful not to bill himself as a \u201cdescendant\u201d, but he doesn\u2019t correct people when they refer to him in this way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMan, that is disappointing. It\u2019s sad that he had to create a false history to build a school for black boys, because ... wait. Why are you looking at me like that? Are you about to tell me that the school is bullshit, too?\n\nNo, I\u2019m not.\n\nOK, I\u2019m kidding. The school is bullshit, too. After historically black St. Paul\u2019s College closed its doors in 2014, Shoemake began a campaign to raise money to buy the property with the purpose of opening a school for black boys. People donated what is estimated to be at least $100,000 to bring this dream to fruition, but no one has seen a school. No one has seen a business plan for a school. No certifying educational organization has seen an application. No one knows what happened to the money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn his recent appearance on The Breakfast Club, he told Charlamagne that he recently saw some land in South Carolina, but quickly told tha God that he\u2019d talk about it \u201coff air.\u201d\n\nWhat happened in The Breakfast Club interview?\n\nLike always, Shoemake made a lot of salient points about interracial marriage, economic empowerment and racism. But like the huckster he is, he sullied his message with dubious claims, nonfacts and flat-out lies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike what?\n\nLike when he said Chinese is now an official language of South Africa (It isn\u2019t);\n\n\n\nOr when he explained how black men marry out of their race more than all other races combined (they don\u2019t);\n\n\n\nOr when he talked about his six degrees (maybe he was talking about his thermostat);\n\n\n\nOr when he explained how \u201cBuddha\u201d is translated as \u201cthe black face\u201d (also untrue);\n\n\n\nOr when he talked about how Frederick Douglass marred his legacy by marrying a white woman, beginning the sentence with, \u201cTake my ancestor Frederick Douglass\u201d\u2014a clever sleight of hand that averted the term \u201cdescendant.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo why do people listen to him?\n\nBecause, like the story of the angels who followed Satan to Earth when he told them how beautiful their voices sounded, Johnson is charismatic, charming and flattering. No one ever tells black people how beautiful their voices are, so many people are eager to join Johnson\u2019s choir.\n\nThe worst part about charlatans like him is that black people\u2019s voices are beautiful, and it is an indictment of America that a snake-oil salesman can sweet-talk so many people into believing whatever he says. There are people who take his words as fact. Right now, in a barbershop somewhere in America, someone is explaining that Buddha\u2019s last name was Jenkins, and how General Tso was a South African leader of the apartheid movement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo one would be mad at Johnson if he stood in front of audiences and simply said, \u201cThis is what I believe.\u201d His opinions are valid, and many of them reflect the thoughts of the black community as a whole. But he undercuts himself by building his house on a bed of lies.\n\nAnd he steals.\n\nThat\u2019s why he is dangerous. Hypothetically, it would be cool as fuck to hang out with Dracula if all he wanted to do was stay out all night and sleep all day. I\u2019d love to have a homeboy thousands of years old who knows how to talk women into letting him come over to their place. Plus, I\u2019ve always wanted to wear a cape, and it wouldn\u2019t look so out of place if I hung out with an entire crew of cape wearers who weren\u2019t doing superhero cosplay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, like all vampires, what Dr. Umar Jermaine Shoemake Johnson really wants is to suck the blood out of the black community. He is a con man who rains slick-mouthed compliments down on angels so that he can befriend the black community and suck them dry. Even though it makes our people feel empowered, it is ultimately the worst kind of evil.\n\nBut just like when Satan sings a solo\u2014it sounds so beautiful.", "keywords": ["school", "dr", "ask", "shoemake", "umar", "afraid", "know", "douglass", "seen", "club", "black", "johnson", "wanted", "memes", "frederick"], "polarity": 0.0428313030638612, "subjectivity": 0.5170358065706903},

Collins turned himself in to police on Monday after a warrant was issued for his arrest.\n\nAt a bond hearing, Collins pleaded with a judge for his release, defended his reputation as a pillar in the community and told the court that he wasn\u2019t \u201cguilty of this stuff.\u201d\n\nAs of Tuesday, the former pastor was being held at the Cumberland County Jail on a $3.75 million bond.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs North Carolina police were securing warrants against Collins, in Memphis, Tenn., a pastor of a megachurch there received a standing ovation from his congregation Sunday after admitting to his abuse of a child.\n\nAndy Savage admitted to his flock that he had engaged in a \u201csexual incident\u201d with a teenage girl he drove home from church 20 years ago. He was a youth minister at a church in suburban Houston at the time.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the New York Times:\n\n[Savage] did not tell the congregation at Highpoint Church what took place in 1998, but he said that he had sinned, taken responsibility for it and never kept it a secret from church leaders. He said that before [his accuser] took her story public, he believed that the episode had been \u201cdealt with in Texas.\u201d \u201cUntil now, I did not know there was unfinished business with Jules,\u201d Mr. Savage, 42, said during the service, which was streamed live online. \u201cJules, I am deeply sorry for my actions 20 years ago. I remain committed to cooperate with you toward forgiveness and healing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, Savage didn\u2019t come forward with his \u201csin\u201d of his own volition. His accuser, Jules Woodson, went public just days before, writing a blog post that detailed his assault against her.\n\nIn the blog, which highlights sexual abuse within the church, Woodson says that Savage offered to take her home from church, where she had gone after school. Instead of dropping her off at her house, though, Savage drove past to a secluded area and had Woodson perform oral sex on him. Later, she says, Savage got out of the car and went to her passenger-side door, getting on his knees and begging her not to tell anyone what happened.\n\nAccording to Woodson, the man of Gold told her, \u201cYou can\u2019t tell anyone, Jules, please. You have to take this to the grave with you.\u201d She was 17 years old at the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWoodson says that she reached out to Savage following news of Matt Lauer\u2019s firing from NBC for sexual abuse, asking him in an email if he remembered that night, and the sexual assault that took place.\n\nSavage never responded to her. After a month of no reply, reports the Times, Woodson decided that it was time to go public with her story.\n\nWoodson also told the Times that she had reported the incident to an associate pastor at the church back in \u201998. Instead of reporting the incident to authorities, Woodson says that Larry Cotton, a pastor at Woodlands Parkway Baptist Church, advised her to stay quiet and said that the church would address the issue itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the Times:\n\nAfter Ms. Woodson told Mr. Cotton about her story in 1998, she said the church sent Mr. Savage to apologize to her mother. But he never told her mother explicitly what had happened, leaving the impression that they had only kissed. In Sunday\u2019s service, Mr. Savage said that at the time he handled the situation in a \u201cbiblical way\u201d and resigned from the church and returned to his hometown, Memphis.\ufeff\n\nWhere, as we know, Savage simply went on to another church.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d like to know specifically what \u201cbiblical way\u201d Savage took to address this situation. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t wandering in the desert for 40 years. And I must have missed the part in the Bible where a man of God takes advantage of a teenage girl, gets called out on his behavior and then just bounces to another, bigger church where he receives a 20-second standing ovation for admitting he abused his power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe that\u2019s in Deuteronomy, or maybe Jesus only wanted teenage girls in dark, secluded places to touch the hem of his garment.\n\nEither way, Highpoint Church says it\u2019s standing by its man.\n\nRead more at WTDV-TV and the New York Times.", "keywords": ["assaulting", "admitted", "teen", "jules", "woodson", "savage", "told", "took", "sexually", "pastor", "church", "sexual", "mr", "collins", "leave"], "polarity": 0.09166528925619834, "subjectivity": 0.44981031090121987},

That\u2019s the list.\n\nOn Monday morning, Philadelphia Eagles fans were understandably verklempt when head coach Doug Pederson announced that Eagles starting quarterback Carson Wentz was out for the season with a torn ACL (anterior cruciate ligament). Wentz had led the Philadelphia franchise to the best record in football (tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers) and was a top MVP candidate for the 2017 season.\n\nAs soon as Philly fans stopped crying into their greasy cheesesteaks, they began speculating about who the team would sign to replace Wentz. Nick Foles is listed on the depth chart as Wentz\u2019s backup, but he is just one of the many trash quarterbacks collecting checks for sitting on the bench. Foles will likely replace Wentz until Philadelphia realizes that his talent is as nonexistent as Lena Dunham\u2019s jawline.\n\nEven if Foles succeeds, the Eagles still need to sign a quarterback to back him up, and many are advocating that Colin Kaepernick is just the person to do it. NFL Hall of Famer Cris Carter tweeted about it:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEliot Shorr-Parks, the Eagles beat writer for NJ.com, places Kaepernick atop the list of available quarterbacks, and the Philly Voice\u2019s Kyle Neubeck wrote that it would be a \u201cdisservice\u201d to not even have a conversation with Kaepernick. Even Philadelphia fans are recommending that their team sign the quarterback who led the San Francisco 49ers to the Super Bowl.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKaepernick is reportedly working out and training every day, just in case he gets a call from a team. He currently resides in New York City, a short train ride from Philly, and has stayed mum on his plans to continue his protest against racial injustice if he returns to the NFL.\n\nOn the other side of the argument, here are the reasons the Eagles wouldn\u2019t sign Kaepernick:\n\n1. They\u2019re protecting the environment: If Kaepernick joined a team and made it to the Super Bowl, can you imagine the superstorm caused by the deluge of warm, salty white tears that would flow all across this country? We don\u2019t have a levee big enough.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. They are patriots: I think everyone knows that Kaepernick wasn\u2019t protesting the flag or the national anthem when he took a knee against injustice and inequality. Like Beyonc\u00e9 said when she presented Kaepernick with the Sports Illustrated Muhammad Ali Legacy Award: \u201cRacism is so American that when we protest racism, they think we\u2019re protesting America.\u201d\n\nBut Donald Trump would die. His heart would stop pumping his Diet Coke-rich blood through his veins as soon as he heard the news.\n\n3. Maybe Foles is really good: Maybe Foles is an adequate quarterback and could lead the Eagles through the playoffs. Could you back up from your computer for a second? I want to laugh heartily and I don\u2019t want to get any snot on your shirt. Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahah!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was a good one.\n\n4. The NFL is colluding to keep Kaepernick out: The Jacksonville Jaguars have one of the best defenses in the league, a beast at running back and Blake Bortles at quarterback\u2014the second-worst play-caller in the history of the world. (Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign manager is the worst.) The Minnesota Vikings signed Wes Lunt. I don\u2019t know who he is, but his name is Wesley. Wesley! The Bills\u2019 backup quarterback is so bad, after watching him play, I couldn\u2019t eat Buffalo wings for a week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf that\u2019s not proof of collusion, I don\u2019t know what is.\n\n\n\n5.

According to multiple outlets, an \u201calternative religious group\u201d in Cumberland County, N.C., has been forcing children as young as 9 to work full time at the group\u2019s fish markets to help fund the organization\u2019s operations.\n\nThe children were residents of the McCollum Ranch, a communal property owned and operated by John C. McCollum, a minister.

The children are performing labor such as lifting heavy boxes/shipments (reportedly some weighing approximately 50 lbs), keeping fish iced, cutting fish and cleaning; additionally, many of the children were performing construction and maintenance on the mobile grills after fish market hours. The former residents also informed investigators that the children were not attending school and were being denied adequate education and care.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice have been investigating the ranch since last year after a 15-year-old boy escaped from the compound in March, the News and Observer reports. Several of the children\u2019s mothers were managers at the fish markets, and authorities say they believe that some of the children may be second-generation victims of McCollum.\n\nAs if that weren\u2019t enough, officers say they discovered that one of the compound\u2019s residents, Brenda Joyce Hall, had been running a fake institution, Knowledge Home School. Using the names of various McCollum Ranch residents, Hall used the school to produce fake high school transcripts and enroll the ranch\u2019s residents in online programs at local community colleges. As the News and Observer reports, \u201cThe records were then used to secure financial aid that was used by the criminal operation at McCollum Ranch.\u201d\n\nLt. Sean Swain, a public information officer for the Cumberland County Sheriff\u2019s Office, says that the department has investigated McCollum at least four times before. McCollum has also pleaded guilty to misdemeanor child abuse before: In 1990, McCollum was charged with beating children with an automotive fan so badly that it left scars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWRAL-TV and other outlets also report that McCollum was a traveling minister, hosting tent revivals throughout North Carolina and other states. Police believe it was through those tent revivals that McCollum, who has been preaching since the \u201980s, recruited people to live on his ranch. Police have so far found 120 people, not including children, who lived at the ranch over the years.\n\nAs of Wednesday, McCollum was still at the Cumberland County Jail, being held on $1.1. million bond.", "keywords": ["children", "school", "religious", "group", "run", "bust", "mccollum", "using", "ranch", "observer", "residents", "labor", "child", "cumberland", "fish", "markets", "slave", "north"], "polarity": -0.060731658692185005, "subjectivity": 0.41358395989974933},

Despite Rocky\u2019s claim in an interview Wednesday with Power 105.1\u2019s The Breakfast Club, reading the TimeOut interview in full will do little to alleviate any frustrations with his thought process. And before that radio interview, the Harlem rapper, who now lives in \u201cf\u2014king Soho and Beverly Hills,\u201d said something equally clueless while speaking before the Debate Society of Oxford University. During that conversation, Rocky said, \u201cWhy are we exploiting the beef between the urban community and the police force when 60 people got shot on a Friday and Saturday [on a July 2014 holiday weekend] in Chicago in black-on-black crime?\u201d\n\nA$AP Rocky\u2019s issue is not that he was misquoted or that his remarks were received differently than intended; it\u2019s that his words have come back to haunt him several months later. They haunt him because as state-sanctioned violence against black people in this country continues to happen, those who enjoy a platform but do not advocate on behalf of black people are widely viewed as part of the problem. In his more recent radio interview, Rocky did not so much offer clarity about previous comments made as he tried to parse his words.\n\nIn his initial response to the social media pile-on, he took to Twitter to take shots at those finding the TimeOut interview late, though he did now acknowledge \u201call this social injustice makes me f\u2014king sick, tho I\u2019m still no politician.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn The Breakfast Club, he said, \"I feel terrible as a black man, as an American. It's crazy. This Donald Trump s\u2014t \u2026 I just don't understand how they keep saying a dark-skinned n\u2014ga don't like black people.\"\n\nStill, he asked, \u201cHow come black lives only matter when a police officer takes it? It should matter when a black life take it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat said, there was one somewhat better explanation about why he does not speak on police brutality:\n\n\n\nYour favorite rappers today\u2014I don't know if it's [Young] Thug, Future, Drake, anybody\u2014you don't always hear their content being about the political s\u2014t going on or all the other s\u2014t. I feel like, why put me on a pedestal for that, especially when I'm not asking for that? I want to make music, I want to inspire, I want to promote peace because at a time like this, I don't have all the answers. I'm not trying to run for Congress or office. I don't have all the answers. I want to promote prosperity especially for black people, especially for just young people, ambitious people, underprivileged. I'm not here to talk about supremacy, who's dominant. It's f\u2014ked up.\n\nAn inconvenient truth is that, as helpful as it is for each of us\u2014especially those with huge platforms\u2014to advocate on behalf of black people in the wake of what\u2019s happening to so many of us, it is still by and large a choice. Moreover, it is a choice that some may elect to do but are unfortunately not equipped to handle. A$AP Rocky can talk about many things with precision: fashion, his flawless skin, the women he screws, the friends he\u2019s lost along the way and whatever else involves his private life. Unfortunately, as he\u2019s made it painfully clear over and over again, social unrest, police brutality and racism are not his forte.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe people who conflate \u201cblack-on-black crime\u201d with state-sanctioned violence are of the Stacey Dash school of thinking. It is a pool as deep as a wad of spit on a New York City sidewalk on a hot day in July. There are many other celebrities\u2014namely those minority ones who mistakenly invoke \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d\u2014just like Rocky. They don\u2019t know any better, and while we hope they get better, in the meantime, it\u2019s probably better off for all parties involved if they shut up.\n\nMaybe we shouldn\u2019t put certain celebrities on pedestals and expect more than what they can give intellectually. Even so, if you go out of your way not only to misrepresent the movement but also to lend your black face to a white-contrarian narrative seeking to discount the racism happening in this country, as A$AP Rocky did, then you deserve whatever comes your way.\n\nAct accordingly.\n\nMichael Arceneaux hails from Houston, lives in Harlem and praises Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s name wherever he goes.

This is basically like that one bad cousin/friend you had growing up whom your parents didn\u2019t really fuck with but tolerated coming over so long as it wasn\u2019t often and there was some sort of supervision.\n\nWhen asked about whether Kaepernick ought to be playing in the NFL, Goodell demurred.\n\n\u201cEach and every club\u2019s got to make those decisions,\u201d Goodell told CNBC. \u201cThey make those decisions based on a lot of factors that are best for their football team. And when they do that, that\u2019s what\u2019s in the best interest.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompletely coincidentally, each team just figured that Kaepernick, a free agent, wasn\u2019t in their \u201cbest interest\u201d despite being a statistically far better player than quite a few current starting quarterbacks.\n\nConsider this Washington Post article from earlier this year, which found that 15 starting quarterbacks were statistically worse than Kaepernick. Apparently, if you\u2019re the Miami Dolphins, the Baltimore Ravens or the Tennessee Titans, winning just isn\u2019t in your best interest.\n\nIn October, Kaepernick filed a grievance against the NFL that accuses NFL owners of the obvious\u2014that they colluded to bar him from playing in the league again. In November, a report from ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter revealed that Goodell would be deposed in Kaepernick\u2019s lawsuit, meaning that the commissioner would have to turn over email and cellphone records that relate to Kaepernick\u2019s collusion case against the NFL.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the NFL\u2019s bullshit, Kaepernick has been living his best life this year. Last week, none other than the queen mother, Beyonc\u00e9, honored him with Sports Illustrated\u2019s Muhammad Ali Legacy Award for his protests during the 2016 NFL season. Before that, he was honored as GQ\u2019s Citizen of the Year, a decision that unleashed a nationwide torrent of white tears.\n\nRead more at CNBC.", "keywords": ["goodell", "blackballed", "told", "statistically", "nfl", "wasnt", "best", "kaepernick", "team", "kaepernicks", "claim", "doubles", "isnt", "cnbc"], "polarity": 0.21908602150537632, "subjectivity": 0.3932795698924731},

Harvey Levin and TMZ. The nascent Kardashian brand. Just to name a few. And these same folks sneer at him now, now that he is exposed as the same black beast he always was in the collective imagination.\n\nSimpson, who has been behind bars in a Nevada prison for almost nine years, is eligible for parole Thursday. We have bets in the office about whether or not this dude is getting out. I, the eternal optimist, and believer in the good in humanity (who usually winds up getting my teeth knocked in), think he\u2019s getting out.

Galanter represented Simpson during the 2008 trial when he got hit for nine years minimum and 33 years maximum for a dubious but dumb-AF kidnapping charge. \u201cParole in the state of Nevada is really based on how you behave in prison, and by all accounts he\u2019s been a model prisoner,\u201d he said.\n\nInterestingly, Galanter also said, \u201cThere are no absolutes anytime you\u2019re dealing with administrative boards, but this is as close to a nonpersonal decision as you can get.\u2019\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut given the notoriety of the Simpson trial and O.J.

Parole is largely determined by a point system, and how the commissioners feel about Simpson\u2014or his acquittal in the murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ron Goldman\u2014can have no impact on parole, according to Galanter. \u201cIt really is based on points,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cHow long have you served, what your disciplinary record is, what the likelihood of committing another crime is, their age, the facts and the circumstances of the case.\u2019\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimpson is currently locked up because he broke into a Las Vegas hotel room on Sept. 13, 2007, and stole at gunpoint sports memorabilia he claimed was his.

Our team that year went undefeated and won the Pittsburgh Diocese, and our only close game that season came during the championship, which we won on a last-second touchdown caught by yours truly\u2014a catch that is still my favorite sports memory and my most inexplicable one (I\u2019d only caught eight passes all year up to that point, and 25 years later, I\u2019m still shocked our coaches called that play for me).\n\nThere\u2019s a certain level of sadism and brutality inherent with dominant football teams, particularly at the grade school and high school levels. While standout basketball and baseball teams can embarrass and shame outmatched opponents, superior football teams also fucking pummel them, physically. It is literally dangerous to be on the field if you\u2019re on a shitty football team, and this point was driven home, in brutal, terrifying and tragic fashion, during a game midway through that undefeated season.\n\nWe were forced to punt for only the fifth time all season. And I remember, as we ran downfield, converging on the other team\u2019s punt returner, thinking about how helpless and vulnerable he was down there, waiting for this ball to drop from the sky while 11 kids bigger and faster than he were all sprinting toward him. And then he caught the ball. And then three or four of my teammates \u201ctackled\u201d him. (And \u201ctackled\u201d is in quotes because the right word for what happened is \u201cannihilated.\u201d)\n\nAnd then I heard a voice screaming from the bottom of the pile: \u201cGET OFF ME! GET OFF ME! GET OFF ME!\u201d And then everyone jumped up. Although gang tackles were common and violent and painful, hearing someone screaming like that as a result of one was rare. And then we saw why he was screaming. One of his legs had been broken and twisted and mangled into a fucking pretzel. It was, and still is, the most horrifying thing I\u2019ve seen in person.\n\nWe later learned that he tore every ligament in his knee and his tibia had a compound fracture. And by the time all the surgeries that were necessary were performed, one of his legs was a half-inch shorter than the other one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore then, I was considering playing football in high school. Basketball was my first love, but I did enjoy football, too. But that was it for me. The last game of that season would be the last time I put on any pads. While, as Gordon Hayward and Paul George and Kevin Ware have recently proved, gruesome injuries are very obviously possible in basketball, they\u2019re freak occurrences and not the inevitabilities that they are in a sport that requires you to collide, dozens of times a game, with people wearing hard plastic and running 15 mph.\n\nThis\u2014the inevitably of terrible injuries\u2014exists in some sort of paradoxical symbiosis with NFL fans. Not only do we know that they are possible, but we know that they cannot not be possible with these insanely giant men crashing into one another at insane speeds and with insane ferocity.\n\nConcussions and broken limbs are inexorable and inescapable. But we don\u2019t actively think about that while watching. Because if we did, very many of us wouldn\u2019t be able to watch. But ... we do actually think about it. It lurks, subconsciously, and gives the game more meaning and context. The amazing feats of athleticism and endurance that occur on those Sundays matter because of that relentless violence and that unceasing threat of terrible injury.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then something like what happened to Ryan Shazier happens, and that inevitability shifts from a paradoxical symbiosis to a reality. To the only thing that matters.\n\nSo, I have a confession to make: While the rest of the woke universe is boycotting the NFL\u2014well, supposedly boycotting the NFL\u2014I\u2019ve been secretly watching Pittsburgh Steelers games. I\u2019m not interested in the NFL as a whole\u2014an apathy that\u2019s been gradually building over the last decade\u2014but I still have an emotional and spiritual investment with the Steelers.\n\nThat Colin Kaepernick is very obviously being blackballed just isn\u2019t enough for me to go cold turkey. Because, to be frank, the NFL has been guilty of much, much, much, much worse\u2014Kaepernick and the reactions to the protests happening during the anthem are basically seagulls on the tip of the NFL\u2019s fuck-shit iceberg\u2014and I\u2019ve managed to turn enough of a blind eye to that shit to continue watching. Comparatively speaking, Kaepernick is, well, small potatoes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I think I might be done now.\n\nThe Steelers\u2019 linebacker Shazier almost died Monday night, and I just cannot get that out of my head. Not so much that he, specifically, almost died, but that the inevitably of terrible injuries that we (NFL fans) accept as part of the viewing experience is also an inevitability of death. It\u2019s not hyperbolic at all to say that watching someone literally die on the football field as a result of a collision is a very real possibility.\n\nOf course, I\u2019m aware that the randomness of death can find its way to any athletic endeavor. I remember, as a kid, crying when first hearing about the deaths of Hank Gathers and Reggie Lewis\u2014both of whom died while playing because of heart-related conditions. I also had a college teammate and great, great friend, Richard Jones, die during a postseason workout with the coaches.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut these deaths were due to defects; pre-existing conditions that could have been exacerbated with any strenuous athletic activity. Shazier has a broken spine because of the naturally occurring dynamic of the sport he was playing. He almost died specifically because he was doing his job exactly how it\u2019s supposed to be done. And I\u2019m just not equipped to possess the level of cognitive dissonance necessary for me to find any sort of enjoyment and thrill and vicarious victory from a thing I enjoy watching on TV when I believe that the actual death of one of its participants is an inevitable byproduct of it.\n\nInterestingly enough, I actually wasn\u2019t watching the Steelers game when Shazier got hurt. I was in my hotel room in New York City, headed out to hang out with a friend, and while I did have the game on in my room, I fell asleep for a half hour or so and missed the entire first quarter. And once I woke up and heard what happened, I immediately lost interest in the game. (I still haven\u2019t seen the play where he got hurt. And hopefully will never.)\n\nI left the hotel, met up with my friend, had a drink and some food, and went back to my room. It was the first time in a long time that I just decided not to watch an entire Steelers game. And while I missed the game, I didn\u2019t actually miss it.", "keywords": ["school", "forget", "football", "nfl", "steelers", "think", "dont", "die", "game", "kaepernick", "colin", "watching", "died", "watch", "im", "teams", "shazier"], "polarity": -0.1144274831144579, "subjectivity": 0.5555050505050505},

Franklin, who directly confronted America\u2019s racist history and helped shaped the discourse around America\u2019s legacy of slavery. The stretch of road was dedicated to the influential scholar Monday afternoon at the Hayti Heritage Center.\n\n\n\nAs the Raleigh News and Observer notes, Franklin\u2019s name on a Southern roadway, which will now be called Dr. John H. Franklin Highway, is significant, particularly in North Carolina. It wasn\u2019t that long ago when visitors and residents entering the Tar Heel State were confronted with a welcome sign from the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClick here to view this www.newsobserver.com embed.\n\nFranklin, who died in 2009, was described by fellow historian Nell Irvin Painter as \u201cthe first great American historian to reckon the price [America] owed in violence, autocracy and militarism.\u201d\n\nFranklin meticulously documented African-American history. In 1947 he published From Slavery to Freedom: A History of African-Americans, described in his New York Times obituary as \u201cone of the definitive historical surveys of the American black experience\u201d and by Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert W. Fogel as \u201ca landmark in the interpretation of American civilization.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former Duke University professor was among the first American scholars to confront the hypocrisy of America\u2019s ideals against its history of white supremacy. In one of his final works, a 2007 article for the Atlantic Monthly, Franklin wrote that \u201cif the American idea was to fight every war from the beginning of colonization to the middle of the 20th century with Jim Crow armed forces, in the belief that this would promote the American idea of justice and equality, then the American idea was an unmitigated disaster and a denial of the very principles that this country claimed as its rightful heritage.\u201d\n\nAs the Times wrote, Franklin earned many \u201cfirsts\u201d throughout his storied career. He was the first black president of the American Historical Association and the first black person to present a paper at the Southern Historical Association, which was segregated at the time (the group later elected him as its president). He was also the first black professor to serve as department chair in a majority-white institution (Brooklyn College).\n\nFranklin also applied his gifts as a scholar to the fight for civil rights, working on Thurgood Marshall\u2019s legal team in the Brown v. Board of Education case, the landmark Supreme Court case that struck down \u201cseparate but equal\u201d schooling in 1954. For his contributions, Franklin received the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, from Bill Clinton in 1995.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFranklin was originally from Oklahoma, but North Carolina became his adopted home state.\n\n\u201cDurham and the entire state of North Carolina were blessed to become his home,\u201d North Carolina Gov.

The fifth commissioner, Mike Criscoe, said that he did not sign the letter because although he did agree with removing the flag, he did not want to take away funding from the department that is needed to keep citizens\u2014and the firefighters themselves\u2014safe, according to the Courier-Tribune.\n\n\u201cI do feel like the flag, people see it as hate,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like to see the flag removed, but it could have been handled more diplomatically. This could have a snowball effect. If they build a new station, the volunteers probably wouldn\u2019t go along. The county may have to pay firefighters.

Tyson was tried and convicted in 1992. He was released in 1995, his six-year sentence cut in half because of good behavior.\n\nTo this day, Tyson continues to say that he was innocent of the crime. Here\u2019s what Washington said after Tyson\u2019s conviction:\n\nAmong Tyson\u2019s supporters was his billionaire friend Donald Trump, who actually attempted a scheme that would have prevented Tyson from going to prison after his conviction. At the time, Trump said he thought that Washington wanted Tyson\u2019s sexual attention and that Tyson was the actual victim.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Tyson\u2019s release in 1995, a few months before the Million Man March, the newly converted Muslim boxer got a somewhat muted welcome-back rally in Harlem, the home of Malcolm X and Marcus Garvey. Civil rights leader the Rev. Al Sharpton and Percy Sutton, the former Manhattan borough president\u2014and, back in the day, Malcolm\u2019s lawyer\u2014expressed public support for the former champ. Jill Nelson, a prominent New York-based writer and activist, was among the black female notables protesting this. It didn\u2019t help matters that Tyson turned down a request to speak to Nelson\u2019s anti-violence black women\u2019s group, choosing instead to shop. Boxing promoter Don King was happy about Tyson\u2019s redemption and return to the ring: He had a big fight lined up.\n\nSupport for Tyson then by many factions of the black community must be put in historical context, one that is relevant as black America continues to debate about Nate Parker.\n\nDuring the 1990s, prominent black men in the public eye were seen by many black (male) opinion-makers and activists to be under attack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n*The Rev. Benjamin Chavis, who, as executive director of the NAACP, had upset many whites when he attempted to unify the radical and moderate wings of the black movement, got ousted in 1994 for privately agreeing to use NAACP funds to settle a lawsuit filed by a female staffer in which he had had an affair. Chavis, like Tyson, also did a hasty conversion to Islam after his fall\u2014but Iron Mike chose orthodox Islam, while Chavis chose to join the Nation of Islam, a base from which he attempted redemption by organizing the Million Man March. Chavis left the Nation a few years after.\n\n*Mel Reynolds, a black Chicago congressman, had to resign his office in 1995 after his indictment for being sexually involved with a 16-year-old girl. Convicted of 12 counts of sexual assault, solicitation of child pornography and obstruction of justice, he was sentenced to five years in prison. Ironically, this opened the door for Jesse Jackson Jr., who went to jail in 2013 for wire and mail fraud, to win Reynolds\u2019 seat.\n\n*And then there was the Rev. Henry Lyons, who in 1999 was kicked out of his top post at the National Baptist Convention for embezzling $4 million spent on mistresses and luxury items. The news came out when his understandably upset wife set fire to a house Lyons co-owned with one of his side honeys. He was convicted of grand theft and racketeering and also served prison time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n*And do I have to mention O.J. Simpson and Michael Jackson?\n\nNone of these cases are similar. But in the 1990s, black people on the street, in the black-newspaper press, and on local and national black-oriented talk radio were clear on how blacks\u2014particularly their most prominent, influential men\u2014had been historically smeared, so they reacted accordingly.\n\nNate Parker\u2019s guilt or innocence aside, a friend of mine pointed out the following to me while I was writing this: Isn\u2019t it interesting that Parker\u2014who, unlike Tyson, was acquitted\u2014is being portrayed as the black-rapist-of-white-girl of the original Birth of a Nation film? Rightly or wrongly, I keep thinking of this should-we-support-Parker\u2019s-film controversy as, ironically, the 21st-century version of the late-1960s furor over white novelist William Styron\u2019s fictionalized maligning of Nat Turner. Again a great anti-slavery hero is being tarnished in the public domain, obscuring Turner\u2019s braveheart contribution via white supremacy\u2019s fog.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSadly, Parker was supposed to fix all of this, not get caught up.\n\nBut history should never be used to excuse abuse by black men. Admittedly, this idea is\u2014and perhaps should be\u2014a hard sell in a country created by still-celebrated white male robbers and rapists.\n\nBlack youths, particularly black males, are constantly warned to avoid the traps set for them by white America and the police, its state agents. So at the risk of \u201cmansplaining,\u201d it\u2019s clearly past time to add male entitlement, including and especially sexual entitlement, to the Talk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is new is that black women are no longer on the sidelines of these discussions, and black male abuses\u2014even ones seen to be historically exploited by whites trying to damage the black public sphere\u2014are no longer tolerated in 2016. *Cough*\u2014Bill Cosby\u2014*cough.* Sisters are tired of taking one for the red-black-and-green team when they have to constantly leave the field bloodied, sexually abused and humiliated. Now they speak out\u2014openly, directly and powerfully\u2014online and on campus. The web, not even fully developed when Desiree Washington was attacked by Tyson, continues to hold black Twitter\u2019s internationally seen explosions over Parker.\n\nMike Tyson\u2019s advantage is that no one ever expected anything significant from him, then or now. Parker is clearly a different story. With the incredible pressure the filmmaker is now under, he will have to do more, much more, than just issue a statement of semiapology\u2014well surpassing the minuscule and unsatisfying efforts of Chavis, Lyons, Reynolds and others of the dial-up-modem era.\n\nParker might have to enter into the public-arena ring, gloves on\u2014fighting not for himself or his historically explosive art, but for the history and current state of black people, for future young black men and black women who will one day soon, fairly or not, judge him and his work by what happens next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTodd Steven Burroughs, an independent researcher and writer based in Newark, N.J., is the author of Son-Shine on Cracked Sidewalks, an audiobook on Amiri Baraka and Ras Baraka through the eyes of the 2014 Newark mayoral campaign.

Simpson appears on the television screen, I wind up remembering that he is still alive. That after all he has gone through, O.J. is not yet at the point where white people are spitting and urinating on his grave.\n\nThe latest time this happened was just Friday, the day of Muhammad Ali\u2019s public memorial, when PBS\u2019 Charlie Rose show had a segment on the 10-hour, five-part documentary series O.J.: Made in America, which debuts tonight on ABC and continues next week on ESPN. It\u2019s the latest product of ESPN\u2019s popular 30 for 30 documentary series.\n\nThe early reviews are very positive, with thumbs-up blurbs galore: \u201cthe ultimate intersection of race, class and the city of Los Angeles\u201d; \u201cplenty of American reinvention and denial\u201d; \u201chow the criminal justice system and the court of public opinion actually work.\u201d\n\nMy memories of this period are pretty stark. Cable television had exploded from a 60-channel universe to a 100-channel one. CNN had new 24-hour competition in MSNBC, and more coming. Overseas television news bureaus were being cut, and television newsmagazines\u2014not sober, international investigative ones like CBS\u2019 60 Minutes, but ones dealing with sensational domestic issues, especially murder and mayhem\u2014began to proliferate.\n\nTV\u2019s new use of extensive, wall-to-wall coverage, heretofore used only during assassinations and attempted assassinations of U.S. presidents, was perfected during the 1991 Gulf War. That moneymaking momentum had to continue. So extensive and sensational coverage of lurid public events\u2014the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill sexual harassment hearings of 1991; the publicly exposed sexual exploits of 1992 presidential candidate Bill Clinton; the case of figure skaters Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan in 1994 and child-molestation charges against Michael Jackson the previous year\u2014had allowed cost-conscious television news to create a tabloid television culture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then in June of 1994 came former football star, TV pitchman and movie actor O.J. Simpson. Accused of murdering his white, blond ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman, Simpson was broadcast live on TV being chased by police in a white Bronco. The next 16 months of television were swallowed by what local and national television outlets were calling \u201cThe Trial of the Century.\u201d (My nickname for it back then was \u201cOthello.\u201d) Cable and local weekday non-network-affiliate TV programming was practically suspended during the weekday as the live feed kept the nation informed of every (mostly) boring minute.\n\nAmerica learned about O.J.\u2019s high-powered legal team, especially Robert Kardashian (the now-dead patriarch of the reality-TV clan) and a very well-dressed, very articulate black man named Johnnie Cochran.\n\nThe October 1995 verdict, O.J.\u2019s acquittal, created what was then called a \u201cwhite riot\u201d\u2014angry whites writing newspaper and magazine articles, late-night TV hosts joking about Simpson being a murderer for the next year, and Rush Limbaugh and other right-wing radio hosts exploding in popularity. (Much of black America saw a black lawyer achieving a victory over a white racist judicial system and a white racist Los Angeles Police Department.) This \u201cwhite riot\u201d over Simpson\u2014a politically and socially \u201ccolorless\u201d black man and the ultimate assimilator\u2014ironically fed the fire for black men to assemble for the first Million Man March.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have tried very hard to forget this time. The period between the end of the Cold War and 9/11 had a ridiculous level of promise. It was largely squandered. The smoke from the 1992 Los Angeles disturbances still in the air, the culture became shallow while Clinton fought to get in and remain in office. Politically conscious rap got its lunch eaten by The Chronic, a herald for a coming decade of gangsta hip-hop music. It was the kind of period where recently freed Nelson Mandela was photographed with the Spice Girls. Wall Street was booming, and consumption and increased entertainment were in vogue.\n\nOne historian even said that it was the end of history, while an increasingly popular black scholar said that black America had developed a nihilistic streak. America\u2019s optimists were convinced that the entire planet was going to drive on the \u201cInformation superhighway\u201d (as it was then called), and a new realm of world social equality was, somehow, going to be born from that experience.\n\nO.J. stands at the center of the 1990s, essentially a frat-party decade for America\u2019s rulers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPost-9/11 society has been less forgiving. Simpson, in jail since 2008 for robbery and kidnapping, has changed American 21st-century culture in fundamental ways. Forever parodied as \u201cJackie Chiles\u201d on never-ending Seinfeld reruns (the sitcom \u201cabout nothing\u201d being the quintessential 1990s product!), Cochran became a household name in black communities thanks to the O.J. trial, and the trusted brand of an injury law firm that was a fixture among weekday local TV commercials. Orange juice permanently lost its nickname. Murder trials covered live on cable television no longer have a special appeal. And professional black athletes are \u201cfree\u201d to be as misogynist and domestically violent as their sports leagues, the courts and the American public will allow.\n\nPost-O.J. culture is one without the illusion of innocence, and Simpson has gone from colorless to invisible.

Sadly, though, this is America and the White House is run by one of the most evil characters ever known to man: White Satan.\n\n\n\nWhite Satan does not care about domestic violence charges, unless domestic violence charges were connected to, say, a Latino-and-African-American football player who kneels during the national anthem; then the president would really care about domestic violence issues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow reports are emerging that Rob Porter, the disgraced former White House secretary who handled classified documents although he never had security clearance, was lobbying for a higher position in Trump\u2019s administration at the time he abruptly resigned.\n\nHere\u2019s how CNN explains the White House\u2019s love affair with Porter:\n\nHis anticipated elevation further highlights how top White House officials were willing to overlook indications from the FBI that there were potential abuse allegations in his background in exchange for professional competence in a tumultuous West Wing. Porter had been actively lobbying to take on new policy portfolios outside the traditional scope of the staff secretary, one person familiar with the matter said, which included speechwriting duties and a role in planning policy rollouts. Neither of those tasks is traditionally carried out by the staff secretary. One of the areas Porter was set to delve further into was trade policy, according to the person. Porter was a regular attendee at a weekly trade meeting among top-level administration officials. He was also being considered for the deputy chief of staff position, another source familiar with the situation said. CNN reported Friday that Jim Carroll, who served as the deputy chief of staff for less than three months, was stepping down to helm the Office of National Drug Control Policy. Several White House officials, including chief of staff John Kelly, were receptive to promoting Porter. Kelly had told associates that Porter was one of the few competent professionals on his staff and wanted to ensure that he was being used to his full potential. CNN has reported that Kelly was aware for months of the potential that Porter\u2019s ex-wives could present damaging information on him. Kelly \u201cdefinitely wanted to expand his role,\u201d a source familiar tells CNN.\n\nIf only there were a group of superhuman women who could have stopped White Satan from getting into a office. A powerful group of women who donned magical pink pussy hats and who marched in force. If only those women had a candidate who spoke to their issues and rallied behind their causes, maybe the world would be in better shape and we wouldn\u2019t know Rob Porter as anything other than the scum he is accused of being.

That, and Tuskegee, COINTELPRO, segregation, gentrification, piss-poor education, mass incarceration\u2014all of the \u201cshuns.\u201d\n\nAnd so when CNN reported that no fewer than six states\u2014North Dakota, North Carolina, Florida, Tennessee, Texas and Rhode Island\u2014have tried to enact protections for drivers who run over protesters, many with \u201cnearly identical\u201d language, even those of us who know what time it is were taken aback by the actions of what my parents used to call \u201cthe man.\u201d\n\nPurportedly because demonstrations inconvenience real Americans with the reality of black people dying\u2014or, in the case of North Dakota and the Dakota Access Pipeline, big businesses from destroying sacred grounds\u2014these bills would offer protections for drivers who cause injury or death to protesters.\n\nMany of the bills were introduced after specific demonstrations or actions; many also contain language saying that the driver\u2019s liability hinges on whether the protesters have a permit for such demonstrations.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s where they now stand:\n\nSenate Bill 1096 was introduced in the Florida Senate in February, and a similar bill, House Bill 1419, was introduced in the Florida House in March. The language of the legislation notes that the driver must \u201cexercise due care,\u201d but if he or she maims or kills someone, the burden of proof lies with the injured person, not the driver, to prove that the driver\u2019s actions were intentional. Both bills died in subcommittees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn North Carolina, H.B. 330 excuses drivers from liability if they injure a protester who is blocking traffic. The bill was introduced in March after thousands took to the streets over the police killing of Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte, N.C. The bill actually passed the House and is now in subcommittee before it goes to the state Senate.\n\nNorth Dakota\u2019s H.B. 1203 was introduced in February in response to Dakota Access Pipeline protests. According to its provisions, a driver who caused injury or death to someone blocking a roadway while \u201cexercising reasonable care\u201d would not be held liable for damages. The bill did not pass the House.\n\nIn Rhode Island, H.B. 5690, introduced in March, protected drivers who are \u201cexercising due care\u201d and who injure a protester blocking the road. If the driver \u201cpurposefully\u201d injures a protester, then he or she can be held liable, but you know that is dependent on the driver\u2019s word (and if that\u2019s anything like the police\u2019s word, you know where this is going). The bill now is \u201cunder further study,\u201d as recommended by the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Tennessee, like Florida, there were two bills introduced\u2014one in the House and one in the Senate. S.B. 944 and H.B. 668 would protect drivers from being held liable if they injure a protester who is blocking traffic in a public roadway. Again, the driver would face charges only if he or she hits the person \u201cpurposefully.\u201d The House bill failed in committee; the Senate one is currently awaiting the approval of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nTexas introduced H.B. 250 last month. As in Florida, under this bill, drivers cannot be held liable if they were \u201cexercising due care\u201d at the time they injured a person if that person was participating in a protest. The bill was referred to the House Judiciary and Civil Jurisprudence Committee in July but seems to have ended there.\n\nIt goes without saying that in light of the heinous death of Heather Heyer\u2014who was killed in Charlottesville, Va., by a driver who drove through a protest and, as CNN also reports, may have done so at the urging of right-wing news outlets (which later deleted the posts)\u2014these bills are particularly dangerous. They are indicative of a state that will excuse bodily harm against those who wish to exercise the rights of free speech and peaceable assembly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough none have so far been passed into law, it is legislation such as this that underscores the need to be vigilant about what is happening in increasingly Republican-led state legislatures and assemblies across the country. It behooves us to fight these perilous bills vigorously, or to run for office to have a seat at these tables.\n\nRead more at CNN.", "keywords": ["states", "language", "house", "run", "protesters", "protester", "enact", "bill", "protections", "senate", "drivers", "bills", "tried", "driver", "florida", "introduced", "hb"], "polarity": 0.014743589743589745, "subjectivity": 0.39316239316239315},

In fact, before he even took office, his team proposed eliminating the Justice Department\u2019s violence-against-women grant programs that allocate funds to organizations that deal with sexual assault and domestic abuse.\n\nAs a woman, I\u2019m not sure how Suckabee reconciles her staunch defense of the president and his bullshit in the wake of the #MeToo movement.

Sorensen denies those allegations and claims that he was victimized by Corbett.\n\nThe White House says that it learned of the allegations against Sorensen on Thursday night, before the Post made inquiries about it.\n\nIn a statement Friday evening, deputy White House press secretary Raj Shah said, \u201cWe immediately confronted the staffer; he denied the allegations and he resigned today.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSorensen told the Post in a text message that he resigned because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want the White House to have to deal with this distraction.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt should be able to focus on continuing President Trump\u2019s historic accomplishments for the American people,\u201d Sorensen said in the text.\n\nMm-hm.

The FBI declined the Post\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nFrom the Post:\n\nCorbett first contacted The Post a week before Porter\u2019s case became public. She said that during her marriage to Sorensen, he ran a car over her foot, put out a cigarette on her hand, threw her into a wall and grasped her menacingly by her hair while they were alone on their boat in remote waters off Maine\u2019s coast, an incident she said left her fearing for her life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd:\n\nShe said she did not report her abuse allegations to police because of Sorensen\u2019s connections to law enforcement officials.

What is the truth?\n\nI personally believe it is unlikely that anyone would resign if the allegations against them were false, but that is my opinion as a person who has never been accused of physically abusing a partner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis administration seems to be full of serial abusers.

Heilemann said that Kelly\u2019s recent actions exposed a \u201ccertain cultural and racial simpatico-ness with Donald Trump.\u201d A few seconds later, national security expert Mieke Ouyang added:\n\nBut the thing that\u2019s most disappointing to me about John Kelly in all of this is that I have known him my entire career. And I\u2019ve always thought of him as a man of integrity who would not tolerate this kind of violence ... and watching him do this, I\u2019m not quite sure who he\u2019s become.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is apparent who John Kelly has become. The Caucasian confusion is only because he is now unencumbered by the restrictions of his old uniform and the protocol of the U.S. military. He has not changed. He has become an unfiltered version of who he has always been:\n\nJohn Kelly is a white man.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cOK, this is the part where Michael Harriot uses whiteness, and white men in particular, as a metaphor for Trump supporters, racists or how Caucasians, in general, have unmasked themselves in the Trumpian era. He will now equate Kelly with the cold, unfeeling audacity of whiteness and its unrelenting need for power and control, even if it achieves it by crushing the windpipes of any opposition. If sunshine is a metaphor for truth and freedom, then Kelly represents the cool, dark malevolence of whitemannery. Go on, Michael.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNah, B. This ain\u2019t no metaphor.\n\nI hate to use the phrase, but it is what it is. To expect some level of noblesse or unwavering integrity from him or any other white man is foolish. It ignores the example of history. I wish there were a more complex, nuanced meaning that I could extrapolate from this, but it\u2019s too uncomplicated to muddy with similes. The simplest explanation is always the most likely, and he is doing what white men do. He is doing what white men have always done. He is a man. He is white. Case closed.\n\nWhen Kelly assumed his role as chief of staff, from the way in which political analysts confidently explained how the decorated war hero would bring order and logic to the White House, I assumed that the Trump administration had mastered a secret DNA-altering process that would transform Kelly into something other than what he was. Men who have honor or integrity don\u2019t willingly get in bed with the devil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet Kelly left mouths agape when he blatantly lied on Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.) after she revealed Trump\u2019s crass treatment of the widow of war hero La David Johnson. He called Wilson an \u201cempty barrel.\u201d People could not believe that Kelly cast aside his credibility to dishonor a veteran, a widow and an elected official for the sake of politics.\n\nWhere the hell have those people been? Maybe I\u2019m the one who\u2019s delusional, but I can\u2019t recall a single point in history when white men haven\u2019t willingly thrown a black woman under an oncoming bus and willingly changed history to make themselves look better. Have they forgotten about the white men who called the cops on Rosa Parks, bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church or dragged Sandra Bland across the concrete?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen has a white man ever given a damn about a black woman\u2019s feelings, well-being or life? Can you name one incident when they have not been willing to lie and manipulate history to sidestep any responsibility on their part?\n\nWhen Kelly said, in an October 2017 interview, that Robert E. Lee was an \u201chonorable man,\u201d people thought that Kelly\u2019s background as a student of military history should have precluded him from making such an idiotic statement.\n\nJohn Kelly grew up in Boston. He has no ties to the South and is supposedly a patriot and a scholar. There is only one thing that could possibly give Kelly the warm and fuzzies about a traitor to the country he spent his career serving. One thing, and one thing only, connects him to the national assortment of Confederate sympathizers and rebel-flag wavers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t know if I said this earlier, and I don\u2019t feel like hitting the scroll bar, but have I mentioned that John Kelly is a white man?\n\nWhite men have the privilege of disregarding facts that show undocumented immigrants work harder, commit fewer crimes and pay more in taxes. Black and brown people don\u2019t have the means or the need to create alternate versions of history or trade in demeaning stereotypes. When Kelly the Creator disparaged immigrants as \u201clazy,\u201d it was a luxury only white men are afforded.\n\nAnd none of this is to say that John Kelly wants to travel around the country lopping off the heads of Negroes, Mexicans and Muslims, just as there is no indication that Kelly ever possessed an unusual amount of the virtue and integrity for which he is so often attributed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe didn\u2019t set aside his principles when he joined the Trump administration; he has always been this guy. He has always been the recipient of the respect and admiration that any stone-faced white guy in a starched white shirt is accorded. That\u2019s essentially what privilege is: dignity by default.\n\nKelly\u2019s military career is laudable because he led brave men who defended this country. But his current career of leading a xenophobic group of racists intent on tearing this country apart is equally important. Neither of those facts means that Kelly is uniquely special or worthy of praise.\n\nHe\u2019s just white.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: A previous version of this story incorrectly attributed to White House chief of staff John Kelly a tweet regarding Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9.

However, on the day he was meant to give the speech, the principal of the Pinetops, N.C., high school, with no explanation given, told him that he would instead have to deliver a short-paragraph speech that had been prepared by administrators at the school.\n\n\u201cI felt robbed of a chance to say my own words,\u201d the 18-year-old told the Post.\n\nHowever, encouraged by his mother, classmates and teacher, Wright decided to give his speech anyway. So when he arrived onstage later Friday, he pushed aside the folder that contained the school\u2019s prepared remarks and whipped out his cellphone on which his own address was stored.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Post notes, in video of the incident, the principal, Craig Harris, can be seen turning to another staff member and whispering in what appears to be disapproval as soon as Wright begins his own speech.\n\nHowever, Wright\u2019s speech goes off without a hitch, with the audience clapping, cheering and laughing.\n\nEverything seemed fine after that\u2014that is, until all of the students went to line up to receive their official diplomas. Wright\u2019s was missing, and his senior adviser told him that the principal had removed it because he had read the wrong speech, the Post reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAll my friends were outside with their big yellow folders taking pictures, and I was still inside, trying to get my diploma,\u201d Wright told the Post. \u201cI was really hurt and embarrassed, basically humiliated.\u201d\n\nWright and his mother, Jokita Wright, blasted the school for censoring a student\u2019s words and then retaliating. When his mother complained to the principal, it was explained to her that her son had missed a deadline to submit the speech to the school. Marvin Wright said that he never heard about any deadline.\n\nIt took another two days before he got his diploma, when the principal dropped it off at his home at the request of the superintendent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Edgecombe County Schools superintendent later called Wright to apologize about the way the situation had been handled.\n\n\u201cI have communicated with the family to apologize on behalf of the school,\u201d Superintendent John Farrelly said in a statement. \u201cThe diploma never should have been taken from the student.\u201d\n\nFarrelly said there were no issues with the content of Wright\u2019s speech, but that it was more of a concern that he used his cellphone and, of course, decided to change course at the last minute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere is an expectation that is communicated to all graduation speakers that the prepared and practiced speech is the speech to be delivered during the ceremony,\u201d Farrelly said. \u201cThat was made extremely clear to the speakers. The student did not follow those expectations.\u201d\n\nWright said that when he was elected senior class president and was told he would have to write a graduation speech, he wasn\u2019t given any guidance. He merely asked for advice from the previous year\u2019s senior class president and listened to commencement speeches online to get ideas. He said that his English teacher gave him a thumbs-up for the speech, and then he left a copy of his speech on his principal\u2019s desk for review the day of the ceremony.\n\nNonetheless, the administrators handed him their own remarks to deliver.\n\nDespite the setback, the Post reports, Wright did get his diploma just in time for when he needed it most.

Sarah Palin, allegedly broke into his parents\u2019 home and beat up his father.\n\nAccording to a police affidavit the Times acquired, the confrontation began when Track returned to the family home in Wasilla, Alaska., to pick up a truck. The report indicates that Track\u2019s father, Todd Palin, told his son not to enter the home because Track was under the influence\u2014a mix of alcohol and pain medication. Enraged, Track insisted on entering and threatened to \u201cbeat his [father\u2019s] ass,\u201d according to the report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe confrontation escalated when Todd met his son at the door with a pistol. At one point, the Times reports, Track \u201cpleaded with his father to shoot him,\u201d but the elder Palin refused. The 28-year-old Iraq War veteran then broke a window, entered the family home and began beating his father, according to court filings.\n\nSarah Palin called the police at 8:30 p.m. When police met Track at the home, he reportedly called them \u201cpeasants\u201d and told the cops to lay down their weapons. Eventually they took him into custody (what a world, indeed).\n\nTrack Palin remains in police custody on $5,000 bail. No word yet on whether the Palins will blame Barack Obama for this, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier:\n\nFormer Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin\u2019s eldest son, Track, was arrested on domestic violence charges Saturday. While it\u2019s still unclear exactly what happened, Reuters reports that the 28-year-old was arraigned over the weekend for felony burglary, misdemeanor reckless assault and misdemeanor criminal mischief. (On the final count, online court records show that he caused up to $500 worth of property damage.)\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe charges all involved domestic violence and stem from a single incident in the Palins\u2019 hometown of Wasilla, Alaska.\n\n\n\nThis is the second time in two years that Track Palin has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence. As the Los Angeles Times reports, court records from 2016 show that he was \u201csuspected of punching his girlfriend, who then became concerned that Palin was going to shoot himself with a rifle.\u201d\n\nPalin took a plea deal following the abuse incident that led to some of the charges being dismissed. He ended up pleaded guilty to possessing a firearm while intoxicated, a misdemeanor. The case was resolved in a special veterans\u2019 court, according to Reuters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPalin\u2019s girlfriend later filed for custody of their child, and in January of this year she asked for a protective order against him.\n\nSarah Palin has blamed Trash Track\u2019s violent run-ins with the law on post-traumatic stress disorder (he served in Iraq). Sarah even used Track\u2019s repeated violent behavior to question whether there was enough support and respect for military veterans while she was campaigning for Donald Trump last year (some military vets were absolutely not here for her scapegoating).\n\nOf course, Sarah Palin\u2019s compassion is nothing if not convenient. She has long boasted about being tough on crime, advocating giving criminals \u201ctougher, defensible sentences.\u201d Her son, meanwhile, never got charged in a 2014 drunken brawl that involved other members of the Palin family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Sarah Palin\u2019s concern about support and respect certainly doesn\u2019t extend to people of color: She has unapologetically referred to Black Lives Matter protesters as \u201cthugs\u201d and \u201crioters.\u201d\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon, Track Palin was still being detained at Mat-Su Pretrial Facility in Palmer, Alaska, multiple outlets report. The Palins have asked that \u201cthe family\u2019s privacy is respected during this challenging situation just as others dealing with a struggling family member would also request.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMmm-hmmm.\n\nRead more at Raw Story and the Los Angeles Times.", "keywords": ["arresting", "palin", "son", "alaska", "officers", "sarah", "allegedly", "track", "violence", "peasants", "tracks", "court", "beat", "palins", "called", "times", "father"], "polarity": -0.056196581196581184, "subjectivity": 0.37759724402581546},

Is a \u201cu up\u201d text basically the equivalent of a Chris Brown song, i.e., super unromantic?\n\nAaron keeps sending Zoey \u201cu up\u201d texts, and she\u2019s perplexed as to whether it means that he\u2019s in love with her or that she\u2019s just the \u201c\u2018u up\u2019 bitch.\u201d This sets off an interesting discussion about the romanticness of such a text. See, depending on who you are and where you grew up, the infamous \u201cu up\u201d text\u2014which is nowhere NEAR limited to college; some of you are preparing your \u201cu up\u201d texts right now and you have already pulled money from your 401(k) without penalty\u2014can either be sweet or effectively a last-ditch effort to reel in whatever booty you can get when all else has failed on the night\u2019s booty quest.\n\nI tend to side with the latter\u2014last-ditch booty-procurement quest\u2014which I do think firmly makes it a Chris Brown song, i.e., nonromantic. Chris Brown songs are all about that action at this point with no attempt at romance, subtlety or pretense. You want a song about drugs, sex and R&B gangbanging (of the Blood or Crip variety, though I suppose of the Bang Bros variety, too) that doesn\u2019t look to make any woman feel special? Well, Chris Brown is your guy. In that case, a \u201cu up\u201d text and a Chris Brown song are the same shit. I\u2019m surprised he doesn\u2019t have a song called \u201cU Up.\u201d (He doesn\u2019t; I checked.)\n\n\n\n2. What time is \u201cho time\u201d?\n\n2:30 in the morning.\n\n3. What does \u201chooking up\u201d mean?\n\nAfter Zoey receives her fourth \u201cu up\u201d text from Aaron, Nomi tells Zoey that a little \u201cd\u201d (or a big one) never hurt anybody, and Zoey retorts that she and Aaron are strictly hooking up, and everybody (including me) wonders what exactly that means since, for Zoey, it apparently doesn\u2019t include the \u201cd.\u201d This might be the most universally confounding question of all time; the truth is, nobody really knows. The ancient Mayans had theories, but so do the current Gucci gangers. It\u2019s all a mystery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my experiences, to white people, hooking up can mean literally anything from making out to filming a flick with 17 people present. OR it can mean oral with no intercourse, which, to many, can leave you virginal. I haz confused. In this episode, though, even the white chicks think that hooking up means sex, as do the twins, Sky and Jaz. The only person who doesn\u2019t? Ana, who \u201chooked up\u201d with her uncle by having dinner in his hotel suite.\n\n4. Do guys talk about this shit\u2014ya know, hooking up and shit?\n\nYep. We do, and it\u2019s just as confusing for us (even in older age). Aaron is wondering (read: concerned about) why Zoey hasn\u2019t answered his \u201cu up\u201d text, even doing that thing where you move your phone around constantly JUST in case you missed a text because your phone is in a dead spot. Every millimeter counts, and yes, that\u2019s what she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAaron tells Vivek that they messed around, which means making out to Aaron but not to Vivek, who thinks \u201cmessing around\u201d means some \u201ctop-shelf action,\u201d but Aaron informs him that if there was a little sloppy toppy, then he\u2019d have said they kicked it. My head almost exploded. And that was not a pun, even though it kind of is. Even if I didn\u2019t intend it.\n\n5. What\u2019s a nudie bank?\n\nVivek is the guy we all hate. Period. In the first episode, he says his father is a bum even though by his own explanation, his father seems like a great dude. Upping the self-absorbed ante, Vivek views nudes simply as pictures of his dong that he sends to women. He\u2019s more interested in the pictures of his wang than the pictures of women he receives, which is probably none, to the point where he\u2019s curating a library of his own dong pics, which he probably views at least twice a day. Aaron has to explain that a nudie bank is the pictures from OTHERS you\u2019ve received, not those that you\u2019ve taken of yourself. #Fax #Facts\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Do chicks from the hood\u2014represented on Grown-ish by on-the-show twins Jaz and Sky\u2014watch Big Bang Theory?\n\nYes. Yes, they do, and to assume that they\u2019re stereotypically watching television shows like Basketball Wives is some racist-ass shit.\n\n7. How easy is it to spiral into an over-texting meltdown?\n\nCringeworthy-level easy. One of the funniest scenes in this episode is watching Zoey fall down the entirely one-sided texting rabbit hole with Aaron. She starts with her own \u201cu up\u201d text, coupled with the requisite IDC IDC IDC \u201cSorry that wasn\u2019t for you\u201d follow-up, ONLY to acknowledge that it was for him because really, she didn\u2019t want to him to think she was over him in case he might end up being over her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen we get to painfully watch as she tries to undo each previous text with a subsequent text that creates more ridiculousness, even getting to the point of talking about family diseases. The scene is PERFECTLY punctuated when Aaron sends the two words that not only run an alcohol-and-salt-dipped sword through your heart but also twist it: \u201cPlease stop.\u201d No extra caps. No exclamation points. Just simple, plain and painful. I cringed.\n\n8. Is Buffalo Wild Wings lit?\n\nAccording to Aaron, yes.\n\n9. Is it easy to be a player these days and juggle multiple people in a dating capacity?\n\nYes. Unless you are not built that way. Zoey is not built that way. At all. Most of us aren\u2019t. It\u2019s HARD work being a player, and if you have a heart to ANY degree, you will fail at some point. Also, Zoey is attempting to date two dudes who she keeps around her often. Also, technology can fuck up all of your shenanigans. #RookieMistakes\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. Is honesty the best policy?\n\nYes.

It is not a surprise when men like Kelley get through the cracks. Our system of regulating domestic abusers\u2019 access to firearms is all cracks.\n\nStill, there are other things that we know equally well, and which remain true and politically untouched no matter how many times we find ourselves in this same place: It is very easy to get a gun in the United States; and where there are more guns, more women die.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost women killed in this country, 55 percent, die in an incident related to intimate partner violence, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of those women, more than 90 percent, are killed by a current or former intimate partner. Most of those deaths, 54 percent, are gun deaths.\n\nThis happens every day\u2014nearly three times a day, actually. But we generally don\u2019t talk about our dead women until our angry men kill other people\u2014at churches in Texas or baseball fields in Virginia or gay night clubs in Florida or health clinics in Colorado.\n\nWhen we talk about these dead women, or the women who survive domestic violence and function as a set of parallel statistics, it is often as a kind of foreshadowing to violence considered more consequential: mass shootings. The women are canaries in the coal mine, or the grotesque connective tissue that bind these shooters, overwhelmingly white men, to one another. In death, they are minor characters in some other kind of story about some other kind of violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen things quiet down again, we will return to a system that does not maintain comprehensive records on men barred from owning a gun, does not meaningfully enforce the laws that might take their guns away from them, and does not consider all intimate partner violence equally disqualifying. And so more women die.

But SOMEONE.\n\nFrom the response of the crowd, I could tell that Tidal X was also fun, but it was also exhausting because it kept Brooklyn\u2019s Barclays Center rocking well past midnight.\n\nLike, until 2 a.m., to be exact.\n\nWith 100 percent of the proceeds going to victims of recent natural disasters in Houston, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and Mexico, Tidal X boasted a lineup that could make your head spin\u2014both from amazement and bewilderment\u2014as everyone featuring everyone was on that night, from the beloved and highly favored (headliners Jay-Z and Stevie Wonder), to those you politely tolerated while everyone else went nuts (Chris Brown), to \u201cShe\u2019s still working?\u201d (Iggy Azalea), to the Bronx, N.Y.\u2019s finest (Cardi B and Jennifer Lopez, whom I now very badly want to perform together after typing this), to get-\u2019em-hype DJs (DJ Khaled and Kaskade), to a lot of, for me at least, \u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was both good \u201cWho?\u201d (Jessie Reyez, whose EP I immediately downloaded as soon as I got home, just off the strength of her performance of the very timely \u201cGatekeepers\u201d) and literally \u201cI had no clue they existed until Tuesday night,\u201d like Tee Grizzley, whom the crowd was definitely into even though I was lost in my own thoughts, which included \u201cI am old\u201d and \u201cWhen will someone sing or rap a song I recognize?\u201d\n\nThank goodness for DJ Khaled and his merry band of special guests, which included Busta Rhymes, Swizz Beatz and T.I. Otherwise, I might not ever have got hype.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile most focused on the night\u2019s overall theme of positivity and unity, with lots of shoutouts to Puerto Rico and its plight, not everyone stayed away from the political. Stevie Wonder, who closed the show (at 1:30 in the morning!!!), brought up how he recently took two knees for the nation in solidarity with the NFL protesters, and Pastor Donnie McClurkin called out for God to help in the White House.\n\n\n\nNo one said the president\u2019s name, per se, but it was heavily implied that something had gone terribly wrong in our nation\u2019s disaster relief efforts\u2014particularly in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, where many are still without power and water\u2014and now it was up to the people, and the celebrities at Tidal X, to band together to get the job done.\n\n\u201cAs people with influence and the power to inspire and galvanize people, there comes a responsibility to use that platform for something substantial when given the opportunity,\u201d Chicago-based hip-hop artist Vic Mensa told The Root while walking the red carpet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI briefly chatted with Mensa about President Donald Trump and his tendency to bring up violence in Chicago as a counterpoint whenever others in the news try to focus the conversation on policing, police brutality, gun violence and mass incarceration. Mensa\u2019s response could easily have been applied to the situation in Puerto Rico.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not coincidental,\u201d Mensa says. \u201cThis is a tactic, a technique, if you will, of white supremacy. You create a chaotic, self-destructive situation for your capitalist constituents, then you let it tear itself apart, then you point to it as the reason to why these people can\u2019t be left alone to their own devices. You know, so, I just recognize it for what it is in its historical framework. It\u2019s not new. This is what white supremacy does. It\u2019s a mind game. And so Chicago is just [a] pawn in Trump\u2019s mass manipulative mind game.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the concert didn\u2019t start until 8, I was there at 5:30 p.m. to work my first-ever red carpet, making this actually an eight-and-a-half-hour excursion. Somehow, in all my years of journalism, including entertainment reporting in ol\u2019 Bakersfield, Calif., I\u2019d never managed to work a red carpet where celebrities and wannabe celebs alike chatted it up with TV crews and bloggers. Let\u2019s just say it was an experience, and I\u2019m glad I was wearing tennis shoes.\n\n\n\nThankfully, I was sandwiched between red-carpet newbie, and digital editor at Fuse, Bianca Gracie and red-carpet veteran, and news and entertainment reporter for Hollywood Life, Jenna Lemoncelli. They both gave me tips: Be aggressive; keep questions light and short if the red carpet is crazy, since most folks won\u2019t have a lot of time to chat; and be aware that most of them are plugging a product\u2014like rapper Yo Gotti, who was wearing a silver jacket with black lettering detailing when his newest album will drop (Oct. 27).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe person who was easiest to talk to was WBNA player, Roc Nation Sports member and recently wed Skylar Diggins-Smith of the Dallas Wings.\n\nI asked her if she had any advice for us out there looking for the kind of love she has with Daniel Smith.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI married my best friend. We grew up together. We went to middle school together,\u201d Diggins-Smith said. \u201cFind somebody that loves you, cares about you, that you can be honest with, that you can be yourself with, and go there. Do it!\u201d\n\nOh, those honeymooners! They make it sound so easy! Lemme just go fire up Tinder right now and find that guy.\n\nWait.\n\nNever mind.\n\nThe concert\u2014one part music fest, one part endurance test\u2014tested both my ability to have a good time despite crippling anxiety from being in a large space with thousands of people and my ability to stay awake. It wasn\u2019t that the acts weren\u2019t good; it was more that I was already tired before I got there, willing myself to go on to get to Jay-Z\u2019s and Stevie Wonder\u2019s performances later in the show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor most acts, the performances were short.\n\nThis was good in the case of some, like Iggy Azalea, who kind of rap-squatted her way through her song \u201cWork\u201d and then did nothing else, while a troupe of black women did the most, gesticulating wildly in support of this nonfactor of a song.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWork,\u201d a song I kind of actually sort of liked when it first came out but had since forgotten about, was an interesting choice, considering that her biggest hit is \u201cFancy,\u201d a far superior bop, steadied by the poppy vibes of Charli XCX. But \u201cWork\u201d it was!\n\nPerhaps it was more a conscious choice to re-educate people about her background (the song features the lyric \u201cNo money, no family, 16 in the middle of Miami\u201d). Regardless, everyone just sort of politely sat through it and clapped (it was for charity, yo), instead of being dicks about her existence within the poppier end of hip-hop.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of only performing one hit, dropping a rap squat and sauntering off\u2014Cardi B performed her banger \u201cBodak Yellow,\u201d and the New York City crowd collectively lost their shit. The regular-schmegular-degular girl from the Bronx went even further than \u201cbloody shoes\u201d and had a whole blood-red, skintight bodysuit on, complete with revealing cutouts and a lot of boob action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Cardi finished her hard rock performance, she dropped the patina of toughness and melted into all smiles, thrilled to be a part of the concert, sauntering off the stage while commenting on how \u201cfat\u201d her ass looked.\n\nOther notable moments:\n\nJay-Z\n\nObviously, this was the main draw here.\n\nJay came out and performed songs old and new, from opening with \u201cEmpire State of Mind\u201d to covering songs from 4:44, including \u201cFamily Feud\u201d and \u201cThe Story of O.J.\u201d He also did his half of \u201cNiggas in Paris,\u201d which mildly annoyed me because all I could think was, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice if Jay and Kanye had secretly made up already and Kanye was here, and then Kanye could come out and do his verse!?\u201d But that did not happen because, as far as I know, that has not happened. There were no big surprises like that during the night, unless you counted all of DJ Khaled\u2019s special guests\u2014which I do not\u2014because they totally did \u201cRuff Ryders\u2019 Anthem\u201d without DMX.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn their defense, though, DMX was probably busy with jail or something.\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nI was surprised at how excited I was to see J.Lo. Maybe it was enduring all of the earlier, lesser-known acts whose songs I didn\u2019t know that made me all the more grateful that she came out to \u201cI\u2019m Real\u201d in a red, deconstructed hoodie-type onesie with thigh-high, sparkly red boots on and mermaid-long blond hair. I was happy to see her! She was like an old friend, happily still willing to go through elaborate dance routines for you, one more \u2019gain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was also disturbed to find that not only did I remember quite a few of the words from \u201cJenny From the Block,\u201d but I also remembered some of the words to \u201cOn the Floor,\u201d her last big hit. (Well, actually, I remember the words to this parody by the Key of Awesome better, to the point where I prefer the parody to the original, but that\u2019s beside the point.)\n\nFifth Harmony\n\nThe only songs by them I know are \u201cWork From Home\u201d (a song I like) and that nightmare song where they name-drop Michelle Obama. They did not sing the Michelle Obama song, thankfully. Watching them also made me realize that unlike with Destiny\u2019s Child, TLC, En Vogue or any other girl group of my youth, I could not pick any member of Fifth Harmony out of a lineup.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(This isn\u2019t so much a slam on them as a slam on me for clearly being old.)\n\nI also hated their outfits (it\u2019s really hard to pull off pink latex).\n\n\n\nWillow Smith\n\nSmith did an acoustic set that the people behind me talked throughout, joking that she looked like her brother Jaden. They also seemed annoyingly unaware that she\u2019d done any music since \u201cWhip My Hair,\u201d which is just ... I mean, c\u2019mon. I\u2019m old, and even I knew that Willow Smith has branched out since her initial stab at being a child pop star.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just during Willow. These annoying people were annoying the whole night with their \u201cjokes,\u201d constant bumping into my hair, running commentary and shouting \u201cWhere\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9?\u201d when Jay-Z was performing.\n\nDonnie McClurkin\n\nIn a show where Jessie Reyez, quite passionately and explicitly, sang about sexual harassment in the entertainment industry on her track \u201cGatekeepers\u201d ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere Yo Gotti talked about it \u201cgoing down in the DMs\u201d ...\n\nWhere almost every woman performing did it sans pants (with some notable exceptions, including Princess Nokia\u2014thrower of soups, first of her name\u2014and Reyez, who both rocked denim) ...\n\nAnd where Chris Brown\u2014CHRIS BROWN\u2014sang an entire song about the lack of loyalty among \u201chos,\u201d Pastor McClurkin was there to remind you about Jesus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI actually respect McClurkin for this. If you\u2019re looking to convert sinners, what better place than a Tidal X concert where Chris Brown is performing?\n\nI\u2019m not much of a follower of any religion, but McClurkin and his large backing choir were memorable and good. Also, McClurkin was there to remind everyone that this was a party with a very distinct purpose\u2014helping those in need\u2014which was nice.\n\nChris Brown\n\nAs if sensing me glaring at him from section 24, row 18, Chris Brown came out talking about how this night was about positivity. No negative vibes. Yada yada. My glaring, of course, meant nothing. Brown has a huge fan base, and they were very hyped for his marginal singing, schmedium bangers and admittedly fantastic dancing. Even I, a proud hater, can admit that the jerk can put on a show. Hence why it\u2019s so disappointing that his personality is so explicitly trash.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut again, the show was for charity, so I sat there and watched, politely saying nothing. I wasn\u2019t the only one sitting down. But I was the only one sitting down not singing along the words to \u201cLoyal.\u201d\n\nYou let me down, guy also sitting, two rows in front of me!\n\nStevie Wonder\n\nThe magic of Stevie Wonder is that in concert, live, he still sounds the same as he did years ago when he first recorded many of his hits. Unfortunately, this magic was still not good enough to make me stay for all of Wonder\u2019s final set because my man the musical genius in all his old age did not take the stage until 1:30 a.m. I was bleary-eyed and starting to have a\u2014for real\u2014meltdown. I left just as he was going into \u201cSuperstition\u201d\u2014along with about half the audience, who were also pooped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was so mentally exhausted and out of it, it took me a good 20 minutes to find a cab to take me home because I couldn\u2019t concentrate on the task at hand. My brain kept saying shit like, \u201cWe need to get home before we wander into traffic and get hit by a car,\u201d but my body was like, \u201cLet\u2019s stare at this streetlight for five minutes.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, I did, eventually, make it home in one piece, but I doubt that I\u2019ll try another late-night, all-night music fest like Tidal X again. I loved the experience, but even Stevie Wonder couldn\u2019t keep my brain from fracturing into little pieces of woe from exhaustion.\n\nNo one can stop that. That\u2019s just who I am.\n\nChris Brown Stevie Wonder Remy Ma and Fat Joe Fifth Harmony Chris Brown DJ Khaled and T.I.

Simpson was granted parole this past July, the Nevada Board of Parole Commissioners, which considered his case, didn\u2019t take into consideration his 1989 conviction for beating his then-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson.\n\nThe reason? It apparently wasn\u2019t listed in a national FBI crime database, according to the New York Post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe paper reports that the Nevada board\u2019s hearing officer, David Smith, says that the panel has asked for a second report from the FBI\u2019s National Crime Information Center to \u201cdetermine whether an error had been made.\u201d\n\nSmith told the paper that, months after the panel filed the request, \u201cwe have not been given any formal notice that the charges back in 1989 resulted in a conviction.\u201d\n\nThe charge\u2014and the conviction\u2014are easily searchable on the internet.\n\nProminent attorney Gloria Allred also noted that the Nevada parole board could have simply asked Simpson about the battery conviction, especially considering that the 1989 assault was presented as evidence during Simpson\u2019s murder trial. Simpson was acquitted in the infamous trial, only to be convicted later of armed robbery.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe had served nine years of a whopping 33-year sentence before being granted parole by the state of Nevada.\n\nSmith shared the information Tuesday. In the meantime, Nevada Assemblywoman Lisa Krasner is proposing legislation that would require parole boards to consider an inmate\u2019s history of domestic abuse before the inmate could be released.\n\nWhile Kramer claims that the measure \u201cisn\u2019t specifically tailored\u201d toward Simpson, the bill does set requirements regarding civil suits and truthfulness, both issues that came up during Simpson\u2019s hearing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the Post:\n\nKrasner\u2019s bill would require the board to set specific standards in cases where an inmate seeking parole was held responsible for a wrongful death of another person and punitive damages were awarded. The measure also would require those seeking parole to sign a sworn statement that all information they provide to the board is true. If Simpson was required to testify under such conditions, he couldn\u2019t have told the commissioners he had \u201cspent a conflict free life,\u201d Allred said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the fact that public information about a domestic-assault conviction wasn\u2019t considered is a troubling reminder of how these sorts of cases are overlooked by the justice system.\n\nThis is less about whether Simpson \u201cdeserved\u201d parole or about whether his record of spousal abuse would have prevented the Nevada parole board from releasing him. The legal system, as a whole, repeatedly fails to take domestic-abuse cases seriously and take them into consideration where appropriate. Consider this: Over half of mass shootings (54 percent) between 2009 and 2016 involved a current or former intimate partner or family member as a victim, according to one study. The same study found that 16 percent of of mass shooters had previously been charged with domestic violence.\n\nThe Violence Policy Center reports that three American women are killed every day by their current or former romantic partners. And black women are disproportionately affected: They make up half of all homicide victims, most of them dying at the hands of person with whom they\u2019ve been intimate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite this, the National Rifle Association refuses to advocate restricting the gun rights of people who have been charged with domestic assault.\n\nIs Simpson likely to go on a shooting rampage? No. But the law that Krasner is introducing in the wake of his release is a welcome step toward making sure that an inmate\u2019s record of domestic abuse doesn\u2019t get buried in plain sight.\n\nRead more at the New York Post.", "keywords": ["domestic", "simpsons", "abuse", "national", "cases", "board", "conviction", "hearing", "considered", "require", "information", "nev", "record", "simpson", "oj", "parole", "nevada"], "polarity": 0.04905864575675897, "subjectivity": 0.37696098450815424},

That has long been established. It\u2019s more like, \u201cYou\u2019re Chris Brown and you\u2019re doing a mixtape with Brandy\u2019s brother? Why?\u201d\n\nNow, I find Ray J amusing on reality television. His battles with fidelity and not letting his wayward dick get in the way of his relationship with Princess Love makes great fodder for Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood. However, when it comes to Ray J as an artiste, it\u2019s been a smooth while since he\u2019s had a hit. Shoutout to the Neptunes and the legendary Kimberly Jones for \u201cWait a Minute.\u201d Shoutout to you folks who love \u201cI Wish.\u201d I\u2019ll even shout out you fans of \u201cI Hit It First.\u201d That song gets on my nerves, but I will acknowledge that it\u2019s catchy whenever played. (Spoiler: I haven\u2019t heard it played in forever.)\n\nStill, while I know these two are friends\u2014which explains how the two found themselves in the studio together\u2014it\u2019s so odd to randomly and suddenly be greeted with news that Sinbad\u2019s former co-star has dropped a mixtape with the dude who looks like Sinbad\u2019s son when he\u2019s eating regularly. Yet, here we are. But since I signed up for this sadism, here is a track-by-track review.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFuck Them Hoes\u201d\n\nOf course these niggas begin their project with a song called \u201cFuck Them Hoes.\u201d In the interest of fairness, I will say that the beat on this track slaps. That aside, how many songs does Brown have offering a faux apology about letting his dick slip and slide? To infinity and beyond is the answer. Then there\u2019s Ray J, who croons in a way best described as \u201cconstipated whisper.\u201d Perhaps \u201cconstipation\u201d is too extreme; if so, you can say he \u201csings\u201d in congestion and cigarettes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis song ain\u2019t it.\n\n\u201cAlready Love Her\u201d\n\nThis track sounds like everything we heard on the radio a few years ago, sonically. It\u2019s not a bad track, but it sounds very familiar to a bunch of other songs. Speaking of, like \u201cFuck Them Hoes,\u201d this song includes lines about codeine, ducking \u201choes\u201d and something about a Mercedes. And Ray J once again is doing that weird whisper where he sounds like his nicotine is low. What happened, beloved?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCome Back\u201d\n\nIn the first few seconds of \u201cCome Back,\u201d I\u2019m reminded that Ray J could sort of sing once upon a time. This is not to say that he sounds particularly great, but William Ray Norwood Jr. is trying here, which, by default, does make him sound better than he does on most of Burn My Name.\n\nAs for Christopher Maurice Brown, he may be a fuckboy, depending on the California judge you\u2019re discussing him with, but he does make solid songs about fucking. \u201cCome Back\u201d sounds like every other sex song I\u2019ve heard Brown make with this tempo, but obviously, this man is stubborn and reluctant to embrace change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSide Bitch\u201d\n\nOh, look, more melodic misogyny. \u201cSay you love me, bitch/You lying/Give your ass to all them niggas.\u201d Like many terrible men, Brown openly brags about screwing everyone, yet is vexed that some woman he\u2019s smashing is just as open as he is. So much of this man\u2019s music consists of \u201cWho hurt you?\u201d tunes, and this is peak Chris Brown.\n\n\u201cInterlude (Vince Staples)\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t care.\n\n\u201cCherry Red Vans\u201d\n\nThis song features Ray J singing as if his vocal coach were a bad-ass 12-year-old whose balls haven\u2019t completely dropped but are two lengthy bathroom trips away from doing so, \u201csinging\u201d the line, \u201cMy wife make a straight bitch wanna go dyke.\u201d Return this bullshit to sender.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNew Gang,\u201d Featuring LuvaBoy TJ and Truth KO\n\nIt\u2019s a lot of Blood references, which I\u2019m sure will be used in a future court case, \u2019cause Lord knows Brown can\u2019t get it together. In any event, this track should be called \u201cOvercompensation.\u201d It should also be skipped quickly.\n\n\u201cLet It Bang,\u201d Featuring Payso B, Jackie Long, Truth KO, Knotch\n\nRay J, weren\u2019t you on Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood talking about selling some scooters or some shit last season?

Here, Brown and Ray J sing about \u201cmaking another one famous.\u201d I\u2019d rather listen to a track of Kim Kardashian and Karrueche Tran yawning for four minutes. Speaking of, round of applause for Tran for the early success of TNT\u2019s Claws and getting that restraining order.\n\n\u201cBurn My Name,\u201d Featuring Bizzy Bone\n\nEarlier in the month, I was reminded that Bizzy Bone is still with us after it was reported that his former fiancee was granted a restraining order against him after he allegedly physically abused and harassed her. Now he\u2019s recording with Brown (who is now on restraining order No. 2) on the mixtape\u2019s title track, no less. As for said track, it, along with the mixtape overall, is as good as Brown\u2019s reputation and Ray J\u2019s name around the Kardashian-Jenner clan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe production on the track is cool, but this song might have been better served if it were called \u201cDamn, I Fucked Up\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m Sorry for Everything\u201d instead of being such a poorly constructed attempt at martyrdom.\n\nLike, why can\u2019t Brown go meet a nice therapist and anger-management coach who helps steer him in a less misogynistic direction and then introduces him to some producers who could help him make the really classic R&B album he\u2019s more than capable of delivering? He\u2019s at, like, Mitch McConnell levels of stubbornness and hostility.\n\nIn sum, if you have yet to bother to check out this mixtape, do yourself a favor: Stick with that. Ray, get some vocal lessons and call the folks who gave you \u201cOne Wish.\u201d Chris, well, you wouldn\u2019t listen anyway, so, whatever.", "keywords": ["chris", "mixtape", "js", "sounds", "dont", "youre", "j", "hes", "ray", "brown", "love", "listened", "track", "say", "song"], "polarity": 0.14900252525252522, "subjectivity": 0.4604751113084447},

While this may seem like a result of the maturity of today\u2019s black celebrities, many attribute this year\u2019s lack of backstage donnybrooks to the presence of The Root\u2019s Danielle Belton and Yesha Callahan.\n\n\n\nEveryone knows they don\u2019t play.\n\nInstead of backstage donnybrooks, this year\u2019s antics were limited to the preshow ceremonies and the after-parties\u2014all involving the superstar upstart rap group Migos, who took it upon themselves to single-handedly fill the quota for celebrity shenanigans at BET\u2019s trap prom. The Root is here to answer all your questions about last night\u2019s melees between Migos and Joe Budden, Migos and Chris Brown, and Migos and intelligible lyrics.\n\nWho is Migos?\n\nMigos is a rap group made up of three guys from Lawrenceville, Ga., named Quavo, Offset and Takeoff, best known for the seminal hit song \u201cBad and Boujee,\u201d which\u2014if nothing else\u2014settled America\u2019s yearlong debate over what is the correct spelling for people who extend their pinkie when they drink Starbucks (except for members of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, who are exempt from pinkie-extending judgment\u2014because they\u2019re all boujee).\n\nWho is Joe Budden?\n\nJoe Budden is a rapper best known for his beard.\n\nJust his beard?\n\nWell, Budden is a great lyricist and battle rapper, but it is a very spectacular beard, which covers so much of his face that some people get nervous looking at him because they think he might get some beard in his eye. Even though Budden has been a respected rapper for years, he is best-known for his role on the reality show Love & Hip Hop. Plus, no one can actually name a Joe Budden album. When I Googled \u201cJoe Budden discography,\u201d Google told me, \u201cAye, bruh, let me get back to you on that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy did he get into a fight with Migos?\n\nAs a lyrical technician holding up the standard of hip-hop for over a decade, Budden has been a vocal critic of young rappers who make songs people actually buy. It\u2019s not that Budden is salty; it\u2019s that he can see the degradation of the quality in hip-hop over the years, and feels that groups like Migos and rappers like Lil Yachty contribute to the dumbing-down of the art form he loves.\n\nPlus, he\u2019s salty.\n\nBudden was on Complex magazine\u2019s show Everyday Struggle with DJ Akademiks when Budden threw down his microphone and stormed off the set in the middle of one of the stupidest, most inane conversations ever captured on video. But if you want to see it, here it is:\n\nThe New York Daily News reports that the group got into a chest-bumping and shoving match just out of camera range that was calmed down by bystanders. Afterward, Budden took to Twitter to explain why he couldn\u2019t contain his visceral look of disgust.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut why does Migos have beef with Chris Brown?\n\nFor the same reason all ninth-grade fights happen: Someone was trying to impress a girl. A member of Migos has reportedly been linked to Karrueche Tran.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOoh, is that the new model Ferrari coming out in 2018? I want to drive one of those Karrueche Trans with the turbo! They say they go 0-60 in 3.2 seconds, but I heard they are really expensive. Migos is balling like that?\n\nNo, Karrueche Tran is an Instagram model who recently broke up with Chris Brown and got a five-year restraining order against him because he threatened to go Chris Brown all over her ass. Tran is now reportedly dating Quavo, which may be the stupidest sentence I ever typed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrown was hosting a BET Awards after-party showing his new music video when someone from his crew punched Quavo and a fight ensued, according to TMZ. Los Angeles police surrounded the warring factions as Hennessy and blunt residue spilled everywhere, but video showed that it didn\u2019t get out of hand. Quavo didn\u2019t even ruffle his sequined crop top.\n\nThat\u2019s so terrible.\n\nActually, it\u2019s not. It marks major progress for the BET Awards. There have been much worse confrontations backstage in previous years. Remember the Rick Ross-Young Jeezy brawl? Remember when T.I. was arrested on the way to the BET Awards trying to buy enough guns to arm a small African country?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve had rappers die over beef like this. The fact that today\u2019s young stars are content to settle for slap fights and a few side eyes is pretty admirable.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking\u2014today\u2019s trap rappers are soft compared with the emcees from hip-hop\u2019s past\u2014but I don\u2019t think Migos are outlaws like that. I think they are young and rich and wanted to impress the one rapper at Sunday\u2019s BET Awards who showed that starting beef pays off if you are a real thug:\n\nRemy Ma.", "keywords": ["awards", "chris", "migos", "fights", "ask", "rapper", "rappers", "afraid", "know", "bet", "budden", "brown", "wanted", "quavo", "joe", "young"], "polarity": 0.04776188941082559, "subjectivity": 0.3881405237788217},

It was included as an exhibit to a lawsuit, filed in federal court by the NFL Players\u2019 Association, demanding that Elliott\u2019s league-issued suspension be vacated. In its lawsuit, the NFLPA calls what transpired \u201cone of the most fundamentally unfair arbitral processes conceivable.\u201d\n\n... Elliott and the Union were subjected to an arbitration process in which, among other things, there was a League-orchestrated conspiracy by senior NFL executives, including NFL Senior Vice President and Special Counsel for Investigations Lisa Friel, to hide critical information\u2014which would completely exonerate Elliott\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElliott was suspended by the league for six games for violating the NFL\u2019s personal conduct policy. The NFL investigation started after his ex-girlfriend accused him of domestic violence. Prosecutors in Columbus, Ohio, investigated but declined to bring charges, saying there was \u201cconflicting and inconsistent information across all incidents resulting in concern regarding the sufficiency of the evidence to support the filing of criminal charges.\u201d The NFL conducted its own investigation and found that Elliott \u201chad used physical force\u201d against Tiffany Thompson. But the details of how the league reached that conclusion haven\u2019t been public until now.\n\nBefore reading the report, know that the complaint alleges it is incomplete and flawed. Thompson was interviewed six times, but just twice were those interviews transcribed. The NFL\u2019s report doesn\u2019t reach a conclusion and excludes certain key pieces of information, the lawsuit claims (bold is as produced in the complaint).\n\nFirst, after repeated questioning, Friel admitted that it was Roberts\u2019 conclusion that after review of the totality of the evidence, there was insufficient evidence to corroborate Thompson\u2019s version of events. Arb. Hr\u2019g Tr. (Aug. 30), Ex. C. at 301:22-302:4. Friel admitted that this conclusion was excluded from the Elliott report, as a result of a decision that she made with NFL counsel\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lawsuit also takes issue with many parts of the arbitration and hearing process\u2014it says that not having Thompson present for questioning was unfair.\n\nStill, this is the report that the NFL produced. It reads like the opposite of an investigative report. It opens with summaries of the events and then, at page 78, goes into detailed accounts of each interview, following the timeline of the investigative process. Unlike the NFL\u2019s letter to Elliott upon announcing his suspension, it does not state any definitive conclusions about who is right, who is wrong, or what might have happened. Unless indicated otherwise, everything that follows is from the NFL report.\n\nThe first part of the report is a summary. Here are significant parts from that section:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey met around Thompson\u2019s 19th birthday, in early 2015. She eventually considered herself his girlfriend; Elliott said she was just one of many women that he slept with.\n\nIn March of last year, the report states, Thompson found out she was pregnant with twins. Elliott told her to get an abortion; initially, Thompson told him that she did not want to. But she miscarried one of the twins a few weeks later, and she had an abortion to end the pregnancy soon after. One of Elliott\u2019s close friends, Alvarez Jackson, accompanied her to the abortion. Though the report notes that Thompson initially miscarried before going through with the decision to have an abortion to fully terminate the pregnancy, in the direct excerpt of investigators\u2019 interview with her, there is no mention of the miscarriage:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the first alleged incident from the week of July 16th:\n\nThe two were lying in bed between 4 and 5 a.m. on July 17 when a woman from Dallas Facetimed Elliott. When Thompson asked him about it, she said that he tried to have sex with her, and when she said no, he tried to have anal sex with her. She said no again, and Elliott became angry; he \u201cyanks me out of the bed and pushes me up against the door by holding me with both of his hands,\u201d Thompson told NFL investigators. \u201cHe chokes me and says, \u2018What did I tell you?\u2019\u201d\n\nElliott denied arguing with Thompson that night\u2014saying that another woman had Facetimed him, but that Thompson understood he was sleeping with other women\u2014and denied physically fighting her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThompson texted her aunt pictures of her bruised arms, neck and shoulders the next day. (The NFL investigation confirmed that the metadata showed the photographs were taken in the apartment on that day.) The NFL had two different medical experts review the photographs as part of the investigation. Both noted that several of Thompson\u2019s bruises did not appear to be fresh\u2014a week or two old\u2014while others looked consistent with bruises suffered within 24 hours of the photos being taken.\n\n(The NFLPA\u2019s lawsuit takes issue with these experts, saying \u201cUltimately, it was established that neither doctor could rule out the fact that the bruises depicted were consistent with numerous other possible causes apart from the allegations of abuse, including drunken and drug-induced falls, fights with other persons, rough sex and other possible causes.\u201d)\n\nOn the second alleged incident from that week:\n\nOn the night of July 17, Thompson went to work at a restaurant where she was a bottle service waitress. Elliott called her 20 times between 2:40 and 3:20 a.m. because he was locked out of the apartment and she had a key. When she returned to the apartment, she claimed that she found him yelling in the parking lot with his friend Alvarez Jackson. He opened the passenger door to her car, she said, and \u201creached over and grabbed her by the arm and pushed her back against the seat and grabbed the keys out of her hand.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the third alleged incident from that week:\n\nElliott denied this incident happened, saying that the two had argued about her refusal to leave the apartment but that there had never been anything physical:\n\nOn the fourth alleged incident from that week.\n\nElliott denied this account of an alleged incident in the early morning hours of July 22, at Elliott\u2019s birthday party, held at a Columbus club, telling investigators he never put his hands on Thompson.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOutside Elliott\u2019s birthday party, Thompson allegedly got in a fight with another woman. She claimed that there was no physical contact between the two other than hair-pulling. But a club security officer and two off-duty police officers working the event said that they saw the women throwing punches at one another, though they did not believe that any of the punches landed. A friend of Thompson\u2019s, Ayrin Mason, provided the following to Columbus police:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMason later told NFL investigators a different story, saying that there was no punching or kicking and that Thompson sustained no bruising in the fight.\n\n\n\nFollowing Elliott\u2019s birthday party at the club, he invited a smaller group to an afterparty at his apartment. (It is not clear if Thompson was invited or not, but she was there.) Thompson and Mason arrived before Elliott and were waiting in the parking lot when he showed up in a car driven by another woman. Thompson claimed that Elliott \u201cdragged her\u201d away when she tried to confront him, but all other witnesses interviewed by the NFL said this was not so:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThompson then called the police. She said she had domestic violence to report, caused by her boyfriend and that \u201che [had] been doing it for the past five days.\u201d When asked if he had hit her and where, she said, \u201call over.\u201d She told the 911 operator that she did not need a medic at that moment but would probably have to go urgent care at some point. Thompson also texted Mason, instructing her to tell the police that Elliott had physically dragged her out of the car. (These texts could not be obtained by NFL investigators, but the Columbus police accessed them and noted them in their initial report.) Thompson told the NFL that the texts were her telling Mason to tell the truth about what she saw. From Mason\u2019s account of the evening:\n\nPolice soon arrived, and Thompson told them that Elliott had assaulted her several times that week before finally yanking her right arm and dragging her out of the car just before her 911 call. Elliott said that he had not ever laid a hand on her and that any bruises she had were from her fight with another woman outside the club that night. Police did not file any charges that night due to the conflicting stories, and they told Thompson that she could go to the prosecutor\u2019s office to further discuss potential charges if she would like.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater that day, Thompson went public with her allegations of domestic abuse in an Instagram post. That afternoon, her father took her to the city attorney\u2019s office. An intake officer there noted injuries on Thompson\u2019s knees, hands, lower arms, right shoulder and across her neck.\n\nA week later, Mason texted Thompson, \u201cDo you want me to lie about what happened that night be zekes lawyer is about to call me again.\u201d Mason told the NFL, however, that she had only sent that text because Elliott had asked her to do so\u2014saying that his lawyers would need explicit proof that Thompson asked Mason to lie.\n\nAfter a bit of back and forth, two hours later, Thompson responded to Mason \u201cDon\u2019t lie if you didn\u2019t see anything happen then don\u2019t say you did.\u201d Mason told her that she hadn\u2019t lied to the lawyer and that she hadn\u2019t even been asked about that part of the evening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext comes the second half of the report, which follows the order of the interviews conducted.\n\nTiffany Thompson, Sept. 26.\n\nThe NFL investigator repeatedly asked Thompson to explain differences between what she said and what other people have said. Here are a few:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElliott\u2019s interview\n\nOn Sept. 28, the NFL\u2019s investigator talked to Elliott, who repeatedly denied hitting Thompson. When he was asked if he ever saw any injuries, such as bruising, he said: \u201cShe always would have bruises because she\u2019s a small girl and she used to get really drunk and fall all over the place. I mean, she would have bruises sometimes, but I really didn\u2019t see anything out of the normal.\u201d\n\nElliott didn\u2019t consider Thompson his girlfriend; he said it was a \u201csexual\u201d relationship, although he did provide her with financial support and helped pay for her apartment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe described it this way: \u201cBut I never was in a, was at a moment that I, did she ever think that we were in a relationship. She never at no time thought that she was the only girl that I was involved with. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nHe also talked several times about threats, he said, she made to ruin his life:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere is another mention of a threat:\n\nThe alleged threats come up again on the night she called police, when, Elliott told investigators, that Thompson said nobody would believe him because she\u2019s white and he\u2019s black.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond talk with Thompson, Oct. 6\n\nInvestigators have only a few questions for Thompson, including if she told anyone else in her family about the abuse. She said she told her Aunt Elaine and her mom. They also asked her why she she kept seeing Elliott. She told them \u201cI can\u2019t explain it; it was really bipolar. We had good times and really bad times.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcKaila Blades, Oct. 6\n\nBlades told NFL investigator Kia Wright Roberts that she had been friends with Thompson since the sixth grade, but Thompson had changed after meeting Elliott. She told Roberts: \u201cI don\u2019t know her anymore. She has a different outlook on life that I do. She hasn\u2019t even called to check on my dad with him having leukemia. She doesn\u2019t care.\u201d She was asked if she ever saw Thompson with a bruised face.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAyrin Mason, Oct. 6\n\nMason said she knew about the fighting but never heard about physical domestic violence before July 21. That day, Thompson showed her bruises and said, \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d She added that in the past she had gotten pictures of bruises from Thompson with captions like \u201cThe sex was rough, LOL.\u201d Despite all this, and a plan to file a police report, they went to Elliott\u2019s birthday party that night because \u201cshe knew there would be other girls there and wanted to prevent anything from happening with Ezekiel and them...she really does love him.\u201d\n\nMason said this about the text messages and the request to lie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElaine Glenn, Oct. 6\n\nIn her first interview, Thompson\u2019s aunt talked about how she told Thompson not to get an abortion. She went into detail about how Thompson\u2019s parents didn\u2019t like Elliott because \u201cthey knew that he was a college football player, and they were always out drinking.\u201d Elliott ended up financially supporting her because her parents wouldn\u2019t even let her drive her car to see him and Elliott \u201cwanted her to go to college and become something.\u201d\n\nGlenn said Thompson had told her about domestic violence, texting her pictures of injuries. Once she Facetimed with Thompson, who insisted it was \u201ctough love.\u201d She said she saw the injuries during a FaceTime on July 18. Before July, she said:\n\nSeveral times l suspected that he was doing things to her, but she always said that she had fell or blacked out. I\u2019ve been a victim of domestic violence before for years, and I know how people live. I didn\u2019t believe her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThompson\u2019s aunt would go into greater detail with investigators about the abortion. She said that she tried to talk Thompson out of it because \u201cabortion is murder.\u201d Instead, it ended with Thompson blocking her.\n\nAyrin Mason, Oct. 13:\n\nThe NFL questioned Mason about two text messages, including one from July 18 in which Thompson said she was going to call the cops. Mason\u2019s answers aren\u2019t much.

So in the interest of time, I\u2019ll only cover where my prerogative leads me. Feel free to cue up select tracks from the catalog of the legendary Kang of R&B, Bobby Brown, while reading this.\n\n\n\nOverall, I would say that once again, the BET Awards proved itself to be the most vital and entertaining awards show on television. I get that it\u2019s a thing for some to pile on BET, but, beloveds, y\u2019all will never be this gassed about the MTV Video Music Awards, the Billboard Awards, the Oscars or any other awards show. Some of us will repeat that sentiment every year until y\u2019all shut the hell up.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow that I\u2019ve gotten the positive affirmation out of the way, let\u2019s discuss some of the missteps in terms of production. Clearly, this was the first show without Stephen Hill at the helm. The show lasted 30 minutes longer than scheduled. I love my people and I love my people\u2019s awards show, but four hours is a long time\u2014especially when your preshow is two hours.\n\nMeanwhile, this show has suffered from technical difficulties from time to time in the past, but c\u2019mon, nah, you can\u2019t cue up a performance and then say, \u201cWait-wait-wait, let\u2019s have a do-over.\u201d Shoutout to SZA, though, for handling that with grace. Still, there seemed to be some occasional sound issues, and the cues were off. Also, who thought that conveyor belt or whatever you call that moving contraption was a good idea? So glad no Negro fell and proceeded to curse out Debra Lee and Co. before presenting a humanitarian award.\n\n\n\nAs for the host, Leslie Jones, my lord, is she blessed with the gift of volume. Very few people can make Mo\u2019Nique seem \u201clow energy\u201d by comparison, but that Leslie Jones\u2014whew, she could wake up half the world if she ever decided to sing \u201cOne Sweet Day\u201d in the shower.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nLike, I can hear her even here.\n\n\n\nIn any event, I was reminded that while I hated the time racist trolls picked on the Saturday Night Live cast member, her actual humor can be an acquired taste. She had some funny moments, but there was something amiss with her monologue and a few of those sketches. You could tell the crowd felt similarly at times, \u2019cause Jones got plenty o\u2019 church claps as she cracked jokes. But she looked nice in red, and she seemed extremely happy to be hosting. I\u2019m going to leave it on that note and wish her well should she get booked again.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, the performances.\n\n\n\nBruno Mars: As a performer, Puerto Rican Frankie Lymon is near perfection and in a league of his own. Funny enough, he had an entire arena of black folks cheering him on while a few on Twitter debated earlier whether or not he was guilty of \u201ccultural appropriation.\u201d Much like y\u2019all\u2019s president, Minute Maid Mao, folks learn terms and don\u2019t really know what they mean, yet use them anyway. The man\u2019s music may be derivative, but he respects black music and black culture and vocalizes that respect often, and obviously we know that otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have opened the BET Awards.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, as far as that lil\u2019 clip of him dozing off while Mary J. Blige performed, I don\u2019t think he was bored at all. No, no, he was just coming down. Off what? I doubt I\u2019m allowed to say anything else, so let\u2019s move along.\n\nMary J. Blige: I love her for beginning her set with that song that basically is one big fuck-you to her soon-to-be ex-husband, Kendu Isaacs. Isaacs went on Instagram after the performance to express his grievances and say he wants to talk to Mary. Kendu, we don\u2019t care, and we resent you for what you\u2019ve done to the Queen. Shoo, sucker. Shoo.\n\n\n\nThat said, I wish Blige had done \u201cGlow Up\u201d instead of \u201cLove Yourself.\u201d A$AP Rocky should start a beauty brand, though.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFuture: If you can\u2019t say \u201cPercocet, Molly, Percocet\u201d during a performance of \u201cMask Off,\u201d you have been officially sabotaged. The staging was sexy, though, and as a member of Future Hive, I feel obligated to say I still enjoyed everything for what it was. I also liked Kendrick Lamar dressed like a Negro League Jax Teller.\n\nBig Sean: Was that a Beyonc\u00e9 tribute? Even so, I appreciate Sammy Davis Jr. in snack form trying to offer more. Lord knows most rappers don\u2019t dare make as much effort.\n\nChris Brown: That song sounds like every other song he makes. Same for the performance. Light Ike danced down, but you know, heaven knows he needs a hug, new creative director and artistic direction. And did he violate his restraining order being there? Please advise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMigos: I thought I was sick of \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d until they performed it and I leaped from my seat to let my feathers fly freely. I love them. They are rock stars; stay mad, Hip-Hop Hannibal (Joe Budden).\n\n\n\nTrey Songz: Trey Songz is fine, but what were those vocals? Trey Songz is fine, but what was that song? Trey Songz is fine, but what happened?\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXscape: I am very happy for them, especially Tiny. They all looked good, although I don\u2019t completely disagree with those that say they weren\u2019t all dressed for the same show. You got the sense that they had some sound issues because LaTocha Scott noticeably took her ear piece out midway. Either way, love them and loved their performance. They need to go on tour.\n\n\n\nEl DeBarge: Black people love George Michael, and El DeBarge seems to be locked in a closet and only let out when the BET Awards are on, so this pairing made sense. And it was good.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New Edition cast members: My first reaction was to objectify the adult actors, but I\u2019ll tuck in the thot and just say that, once again, they were fantastic. I really wish Luke James could score a moment with his own music. He\u2019s a phenomenal Johnny Gill, but we need to get him some music that\u2019ll let him body-roll and sing like that with his original music.\n\n\n\nThe real New Edition: BET has really earned back its investment with the movie. Bobby Brown\u2019s mint accessory made my night, and I like that even if he\u2019s moving a lil\u2019 slower these days, he still keeps up. If that set was a tour commercial, they succeeded with me.\n\nSZA: She sounded great\u2014awful opening that was no fault of her own notwithstanding. However, she probably should have performed in the first or second hour. The sequencing of performances felt off.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nTamar Braxton: Tamar Braxton can sing exceptionally well, but she was not singing a lick during her performance of \u201cMy Man.\u201d So why she was aggressively moving her wig like it was dipped in a fire ant bed before she glued it to her head is beyond me. I saved this for last because it was the absolute most.\n\nAll right, before I (let) go:\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheers to Solange.\n\nGIF\n\nAnd Remy Ma for those wins.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBye, blacks.\n\n", "keywords": ["chicken", "awards", "felt", "performance", "songz", "dont", "bet", "music", "love", "say", "let", "forever", "song", "entertained"], "polarity": 0.18189406065456484, "subjectivity": 0.5161022287702961},

Her sister, Wanda Pasha, was separating from her increasingly violent and erratic husband, who lay in wait at her Piscataway, N.J., home. He shot and killed Baraka and Holmes, spinning a community into an all-too-familiar grief.\n\nFourteen years later, Newark, N.J., Mayor Ras Baraka cut the ribbon for the Shani Baraka Women\u2019s Resource Center in the city\u2019s South Ward, blocks from where Shani grew up. In what was once a years-old abandoned lot now stands the 12,000-square-foot building, a beacon for women in crisis.\n\n\n\n\u201cShani was my sister, my baby sister, but she really was like my big sister in the community,\u201d Ras Baraka says. \u201cShe represented a lot to me and our neighborhood.\u201d\n\n\n\nShani Baraka was a lifelong Newark resident who taught science and language arts at Vailsburg Middle School. She was an assistant coach of the girls\u2019 basketball team at Malcolm X. Shabazz High School (alma mater of current WNBA player Matee Ajavon); a state champion herself; a member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority; and out, loud and proud in Newark\u2019s LGBTQ community. She was also the youngest daughter of poets Amina and the late Amiri Baraka.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[Shani] was victimized because of domestic violence,\u201d Ras Baraka says. \u201cThe center really symbolizes not just something for our family but also for women in the neighborhood, especially women of color.\u201d\n\nOften shrouded in secrecy and shame, domestic violence is a hidden public health crisis, especially for black women. Research indicates that at least 40 percent of women killed in intimate-partner homicides in the nation are black; it is the leading cause of death for black women between the ages of 15 and 45. In New Jersey, black women between the ages of 25 and 45 are 3.5 times more likely than white women to be victims of intimate-partner homicides.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMayor Baraka \u201cabsolutely\u201d thinks that the center could have helped his older sister during her violent home situation.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt would have been a place to go to talk,\u201d Baraka says. \u201cAnd [learn] how to effectively get out of the situation. And how not [to] be embarrassed by the fact that it\u2019s happening. And [know] that other women are going through this and it has nothing to do with you. And you need to remove yourself.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the minute you try to separate is when it escalates,\u201d he concedes. \u201cThat\u2019s when you need as much help as you can get.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStatistics show that the most dangerous time for a woman in a violent relationship is when the victim tries to leave the abuser. According to a 2013 report (pdf) from the New Jersey Domestic Violence Fatality Review Board, there are some unique factors that prevent black women from seeking help. These include systemic racial and gendered oppression, as well as economic and immigration status. But there are also cultural barriers, like not seeing themselves reflected in existing services, racial loyalty, fear of being judged, religion and\u2014my words\u2014always placing themselves last.\n\n\n\nIsabel Livingston doesn\u2019t fit the \u201ctype\u201d of an abused woman. The young entrepreneur and business owner is drop-dead gorgeous, stylish and always well turned out. When she sought help, it came full circle for her.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I came through the doors of the center, I had been dealing with trauma from my childhood and some of the abuse that I had experienced,\u201d the 44-year-old Newark native says. \u201cIt was the first time that I had ever talked to someone about what I was experiencing.\u201d\n\nLivingston says that she knew Shani as a kid, and joined the high school basketball team because of her: \u201cIt was the first and only time I was ever on a team, but she changed my life and how I felt about myself.\u201d\n\nShe explained that because neither she nor her abuser (a man of economic means and community standing) fit into stereotypes of a survivor or a batterer, she dreaded judgment above all else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEventually, and with encouragement from staff at the center, she was able to call together about 50 members of her inner circle and publicly tell her story.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt felt amazing not to have to walk around with the guilt and the shame of the entire situation,\u201d she says. \u201cI think when people look a certain way, because the expectation of life is different for them, it makes it harder to come forward. People look at them and say, \u2018Oh, how could you or why would you?\u2019 So I think that may be part of the reason why I stayed silent for so long, because I certainly didn\u2019t want to disappoint people.\u201d\n\n\n\nSince opening its doors in May, the Shani Baraka Women\u2019s Resource Center has served over 1,000 women. It\u2019s unique in that it is split into two wings, with social services on one side and a fully functioning police station on the other. There is a 24-hour law-enforcement presence and various entrances into the mirrored structure so that those on the outside cannot see in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the social services side, there are offices and resources from a plethora of partner organizations\u2014including the Association of Black Psychologists, Planned Parenthood, the Summer Youth Employment program and RZ the Flags\u2014as well as full-time staff from rape and sexual assault and HIV-education organizations. The center also boasts a doctor\u2019s office, a safe space for the LGBTQ community, and grief and trauma counseling. The police side houses the entire city\u2019s domestic violence, sexual assault, missing-persons, elder-abuse, bias-crimes and human trafficking divisions.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsia Smith, of the center\u2019s Domestic Violence Response Team, says that her team works very closely with law enforcement to bridge the divide that exists between police and many communities of color. \u201cWe\u2019re able to make [victim-survivors] feel a lot more comfortable about speaking with the officers, the majority of whom are women, ironically,\u201d Smith says.\n\n\u201cWe had a woman who came in today who was strangled,\u201d says Smith, who noted that all it takes is 4 pounds of pressure to die by choking.\n\n\u201cShe was threatened with a weapon and was very shaken up,\u201d Smith adds. \u201cOnce she came into the center, we allowed her to speak with one of the officers and to ascertain a statement. Then she came over to the social services side and really began to open up.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe discovered that her needs extended far beyond her situation today,\u201d Smith says. \u201cThis young lady is going to have to come back repeatedly. So it\u2019s more of a holistic approach that we take for victim-survivors. I think it makes the officers\u2019 lives much easier because they can\u2019t devote but so much time to an individual, but they really want to do more. We can be an extension of what they do.\u201d\n\nA few years after Shani Baraka\u2019s death, Ras Baraka dedicated a book of poetry, Black Girls Learn Love Hard (Moore Black Press), to her. He still laments how intimate-partner violence ripped through the fabric of his close-knit social network, way beyond the two people involved.\n\n\u201cIt was a community problem,\u201d he acknowledges. \u201cBoth families knew each other. It caused a lot of tension in our neighborhood, and obviously a lot of grief in our family.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Baraka says that the flip side of that is having familiar faces in the community take care of one another. He sees the center as an accomplishment of that as well as a semblance of closure.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt gave me the opportunity to do something because it felt like I did nothing,\u201d he says. \u201cI was hopeless in the whole situation. And you always feel like you have to protect your sister and the women in your family, and then you realize that we have to empower women to protect themselves.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLearn more about the Shani Baraka Women\u2019s Resource Center below:", "keywords": ["shani", "smith", "inspired", "sister", "family", "violence", "center", "mayor", "community", "team", "haven", "women", "black", "ras", "newark", "tragedy", "survivors", "baraka", "nj"], "polarity": 0.05779617329235651, "subjectivity": 0.41016754238128295},

Brown also stated that Tran and her team have been trying to use him for their own come-up to \u201cpromote something.\u201d\n\nSure, Brown said, he admits to beating Rihanna\u2019s face to a bloody pulp, but says he was guilty back then.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Tran says that Brown pushed her down the stairs, punched her in the stomach and made death threats. Brown was ordered to stay at least 100 yards from Tran. Tran and Brown will appear in court later this summer.", "keywords": ["chris", "trying", "tran", "abused", "stated", "wrongdoingon", "threats", "lying", "thirsty", "brown", "yards", "thenaccording", "karrueche", "tmz"], "polarity": -0.11544011544011545, "subjectivity": 0.5425685425685426},

Actually, he wasn\u2019t yet a man; he was 13, an eighth-grader to my sixth. And we weren\u2019t fighting, or even roughhousing. We were rehearsing for a school play when he abruptly asked me to be his girlfriend.\n\n\n\nEmbarrassed and incredulous, I laughed and said, \u201cNo!\u201d (I was 11, after all). Then I watched his face contort in anger, just before he coldcocked me. Twice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI remember how everything went white for a moment and how I grabbed the edge of the stage to steady myself. When I opened my eyes, our drama teacher, a black parent who ran drama club as part of our after-school curriculum, was standing between the boy and me. After ensuring that I wasn\u2019t bleeding or broken anywhere, she assured me that he was sorry and made him apologize. Then she asked me to apologize, too. After all, I\u2019d laughed at him.\n\nIn that moment, I was made to understand that I was, at least in part, responsible for his actions. His wounded pride was of equal priority to\u2014if not higher than\u2014my safety. My forgiveness was instantly expected, and we were to proceed as if nothing had happened. And we did.\n\nIt would be years before I learned that my drama teacher\u2019s husband was known to raise a hand or two of his own. But most significantly, I remember feeling that I\u2019d experienced some sick rite of passage, and that it likely wouldn\u2019t be the last time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was made to understand that I was, at least in part, responsible for his actions.\n\nAt 21, and a senior in college, I began my first and only cohabiting relationship. It seemed that my life was beginning to come together: Within months I had the degree; the Brooklyn, N.Y., brownstone duplex; the burgeoning career; and the man I expected to be my future husband. All that was left was to add two kids and stir.\n\nWe had a passionate relationship. That was the word I always used: \u201cpassionate.\u201d With limited experience in either adulthood or adult relationships, I thought that level of passion meant ours was a love worth fighting for\u2014literally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was so deeply in love, I dismissed the stories of his last relationship, nodding in agreement when he called his ex-girlfriend \u201ccrazy.\u201d I imagined how she undoubtedly provoked him when he remorsefully admitted to once \u201cshoving\u201d her, and considered her vengeful for calling the cops on him. I self-righteously assumed that she\u2019d been the poison in their toxic relationship, even while cringing at his increasingly harsher criticisms and controlling behavior.\n\nEven when he \u201cshoved\u201d me the first time\u2014into a wall, after dragging me up the stoop of our brownstone by my collar when I\u2019d tried to leave, ripping my jacket almost in two\u2014my mind spun less from the impact than from frantically trying to figure out how to fix our relationship. How small could I shrink to fix us?\n\nBesides, I didn\u2019t fit any of the clich\u00e9s of an \u201cabused woman.\u201d In fact, the closest I\u2019d ever been to witnessing violence in my childhood home was overhearing the terrifying screams and thuds of the neighbors upstairs, who my mother gently explained were \u201cmoving furniture\u201d before she called the police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut now we were the neighbors whose screams were heard through the wall, the spectacle on the front steps of our home as passersby stared on in horror. I\u2019d just graduated from a progressive, woman-centric college, fully convinced of my rights and autonomy. And yet the next time would find me with the hand of the man I loved clenched around my neck as he threatened to bash my face in if I fought back. Clich\u00e9s be damned. How small could I shrink?\n\nThis is the memory that instantly came to mind when I read the results of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s latest report, \u201cRacial and Ethnic Differences in Homicides of Adult Women and the Role of Intimate Partner Violence.\u201d Unsurprisingly (to me, at least), the CDC\u2019s findings revealed that over half of female homicide victims between the ages of 18 and 44 are killed by intimate partners. Also not surprising: Non-Hispanic black women are killed at almost three times the rate of their white counterparts\u2014the highest rate of all ethnicities, as a matter of fact. And 98 percent of those homicides are committed by men.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo more years would pass before I left that relationship\u2014even longer before I would readily identify it as abuse, and confess it to friends and family. By that time, he\u2019d bedded and moved in with the neighbor who lived directly above the apartment we once shared, and I was filing dozens of Affidavit of Forgery forms to dispute a series of fraudulent checks that bore my name but, suspiciously, his bank and branch. (Did I mention that he was a graphic designer\u2014and that financial abuse is a form of domestic abuse, too?)\n\nWhat are we going to do about the black girls who are told long before they even have an intimate partner that their safety isn\u2019t paramount?\n\nThe CDC study cites \u201cargument and jealousy\u201d as \u201ccommon precipitating circumstances.\u201d As a remedy, it suggests \u201ctargeted [intimate-partner violence] prevention programs for populations at disproportionate risk and enhanced access to intervention services for persons experiencing IPV are needed to reduce homicides among women.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSure. But specifically, what are we going to do about the black girls who are told long before they even have an intimate partner that their safety isn\u2019t paramount? And what about the black boys who are being taught\u2014along with the rest of the world\u2014that black girls are of ultimately less value? As one Georgetown University study found (pdf), there is the perception that black girls \u201cneed less nurturing; less protection; to be supported less; to be comforted less; are more independent; know more about adult topics; know more about sex.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat does that say about the perception of their worth?\n\nAs we saw with the emergence of yet another R. Kelly scandal last week\u2014and the inevitable chorus of those who incessantly cape for \u201cthe Pied Piper\u201d\u2014there is an almost pathological undervaluing of the lives of black girls and women in America. (How else do you explain allowing a predator to thrive in our midst for over two decades?)\n\nDespite ample evidence of #BlackGirlMagic and annual proclamations that Black Girls Rock!, when it comes to making black lives matter, the lost lives of black men are still generally the ones that take precedence in that discussion. And yet, the CDC suggests that 55 percent of murdered black women\u2014women who still overwhelming choose partners within their race\u2014will be killed by the black men they presumably love.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven this evidence, it seems that we have two options: Believe that black men are inherently more violent, or believe that the lives of black women are inherently less valued. And while I refuse to accept the former as truth, there is evidence far beyond Georgetown\u2019s or the CDC\u2019s findings to support the latter. The truth is, how we talk to and about black women matters.\n\nWhen we talk about how patriarchy and misogynoir function even among those who, as Jamilah Lemieux wrote, \u201care black, who were raised by black women and profess to value black people,\u201d we rarely tell the origin stories. We don\u2019t discuss how a \u201cride or die\u201d mentality is often ingrained in our daughters before they ever learn the phrase. Or how our blind allegiances encourage our sons to value black women\u2019s loyalty more than black women\u2019s lives.\n\nI never told my parents about the first time I was hit. Not because I thought I wouldn\u2019t be believed, but because even at 11, I understood that I was to protect this boy, even above myself. It was my first experience of shrinking to fix a problem that wasn\u2019t mine. And as predicted, it wasn\u2019t my last.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause all too often, this is the measure of a woman\u2019s worth: We ride for our men, even when at risk of dying at their hands. What are we going to do about that?\n\nIf you or someone you know is affected by domestic violence, please contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233\n\n6", "keywords": ["value", "intimate", "devils", "tells", "wasnt", "know", "violence", "id", "dancing", "report", "partner", "women", "relationship", "men", "black", "girls", "lives", "man"], "polarity": 0.016976002999625053, "subjectivity": 0.41205161854768135},

This casting decision raises important questions about black entertainment, mental health and the blind eye we turn to violence against women.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost of us were introduced to the fresh-faced Brown in 2005, when the then-15-year-old Tappahannock, Va., native and musical newcomer released the club hit \u201cRun it!\u201d Since then, Brown\u2019s career has been riddled with a series of arrests, court appearances and public incidents that raise questions about the 27-year-old\u2019s ability to take responsibility for himself and his actions.\n\nBrown\u2019s singing career has been essentially overshadowed by his violence against women.\n\nIn 2009, Brown pleaded guilty to felony assault and served five years of probation after viciously attacking singer Rihanna. Yet he didn\u2019t learn much from the experience. After the two \u201cmade amends,\u201d Brown still didn\u2019t seem to view the altercation as much more serious than a \u201cmistake.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust this month, Brown was served a restraining order after reportedly physically assaulting his ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran. Her descriptions of the events that transpired between them include her claims of him \u201cpunching her in the stomach and pushing her down stairs.\u201d\n\nThese aren\u2019t mistakes. They are evidence of long-standing issues with violence against women that the superstar has somehow managed to maintain while nurturing his on-again, off-again singing career.\n\nSome have suggested that Brown\u2019s issues with violence against women stem from substance abuse. To this effect, a Billboard expos\u00e9 published earlier this month claims that Brown has a crippling addiction to serious drugs like lean (a mixture of \u201cpromethazine/codeine syrup and a soft drink\u201d), coke and Molly.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOthers have said that Brown\u2019s aggression can be attributed to post-traumatic stress disorder and bipolar II, both of which he was diagnosed with in 2014. But the fact is, many people live with and manage mental-health conditions like PTSD and bipolar disorder every single day without physically harming anyone else. Studies actually show that bipolar disorder is not linked to violence. Rather, it is substance abuse that fuels the fits of rage against others.\n\nSo, yes, this is complicated.\n\nOn the one hand, Brown continues to show that he does not intend to take responsibility for his actions or his repeated injuries of his romantic partners. On the other hand, he is clearly self-medicating, which likely causes his violent behavior.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsn\u2019t it time we started asking his team some questions, though? Why do they continue to watch Brown as he ruins his own life and the lives of others around him? At what point do they have that come-to-Jesus meeting and check him on his behavior? These are the types of preventive (and loving) actions that his family and friends should be taking. But it seems as if they are just along for the ride (a point made by Crissle and Kid Fury on a recent episode of The Read).\n\nMost importantly, Brown joins a long line of black men\u2014like R. Kelly, Bill Cosby, Dr. Dre and many others\u2014whose artistic expression is often valued over their personal behavior. There are fans who would rather wear Beats by Dre than interrogate the irony of the brand\u2019s iconic name. They purchase tickets to awards shows and concerts where R. Kelly will perform, knowing full well that their money goes toward silencing the young black women and girls on Chicago\u2019s South Side who were reportedly sexually exploited by this man. These fans even say things like, \u201cBill Cosby has done so much for this community\u201d as Cosby himself admits to having drugged and sexually assaulted scores of women for decades.\n\n\n\nSimply put, there is no question that Brown has deep-seated issues with women and substance abuse. The two should not be seen as mutually exclusive. And what we shouldn\u2019t be doing is turning a blind eye to one in favor of the other, especially if it is only because we like his music.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Black-ish team must know this.\n\nAlthough the producers and showrunners haven\u2019t yet spoken out regarding the casting decision, one could interpret the choice as an effort to support the artist through his rehabilitation efforts. But as late as 2014, the singer was kicked out of a Malibu, Calif., rehab center for allegedly breaking several of its policies\u2014namely, getting \u201ctoo close\u201d to women. Later that year, Rolling Stone reported on the prospects of a BET-backed Brown reality show that would chronicle his life following his arrest and stint in rehab. While the show never saw the light of day, it seems as though some networks are still willing to support Brown\u2019s behaviors even as he fails to change.\n\nTo empower Brown with a guest-starring opportunity on such a prominent black show\u2014which, mind you, employs black female activists who have repeatedly spoken out on issues that women of color face in entertainment\u2014seems counterintuitive and disrespectful to viewers who hold the show in high esteem. No matter what the intention, this casting choice reeks of enabling. It provides a blank check for a clearly ill person to continue to inflict harm on himself and those around him. Meanwhile, it sends the message that virtually any behavior is easily forgiven when ratings are at stake.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPart of me wonders what the women on the show thought of this casting. I would expect Jenifer Lewis, Tracee Ellis Ross and Yara Shahidi to at least raise an eyebrow.\n\n\n\nWhile delivering a gorgeous acceptance speech at the 2017 Golden Globe Awards after winning for best actress in a TV comedy or musical series\u2014becoming the first black woman to win the award since 1983\u2014Ross said, \u201cIt is an honor to be on this show ... to continue expanding the way we are seen and known, and to show the magic and the beauty and the sameness of a story and stories that are outside where the industry usually looks.\u201d\n\nRoss hits on an important point here: Black-ish is such a powerful show mainly because it subverts the traditional storytelling and casting choices in Hollywood. It puts a quirky black family at the center of a universe and looks beyond the typical white veneer that has come to define so much of entertainment today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Brown\u2019s role on the show, Black-ish\u2019s producers run the risk of undermining these critical and hard-fought strides. While they are deliberately working against racial stereotypes through their full and vibrant depictions of black families, they still have an opportunity to tackle the nuances and complexities of gender and intimate-partner violence, especially where it concerns black women.\n\nBut casting Brown is a step backward. It proves that misogynoir and violence against women have still not registered with many leaders of industry as deal breakers for their faves. It is up to viewers to take to task the casting directors and the responsible parties behind this choice.\n\n\n\nWhat Brown needs is more (and better) people, not more casting credits. Until these record labels, networks and shows grapple with the equal importance of what these artists do both on and off the set, we must continue to hold them accountable.\n\n", "keywords": ["chris", "issues", "appearance", "singer", "guest", "violence", "brown", "continue", "women", "substance", "browns", "black", "blackish", "casting"], "polarity": 0.06144487200042756, "subjectivity": 0.49647560258671347},

During an interview with the fake-news show Fox & Friends, Donald Trump said that he believes Obama is behind the leaks within his administration. He also added that he believes that angry town hall folks are plants put there by Obama\u2019s administration and not there because he\u2019s the worst president to ever president.\n\n\u201cNo, I think that President Obama is behind it because his people are certainly behind it,\u201d Trump said during the show that aired Monday, CNN reports. \u201cAnd some of the leaks possibly come from that group, which are really serious because they are very bad in terms of national security. But I also understand that is politics. In terms of him being behind things, that\u2019s politics. And it will probably continue.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know how to say this politely, but Obama doesn\u2019t give a fuck about you. In fact, he\u2019s currently filing a restraining order against your ass because you are acting crazy and disturbing his happy place after eight years of running this abusive-ass country the best he could.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump doesn\u2019t want to see you. He doesn\u2019t want your job. He doesn\u2019t want you calling him. He broke up with America, and it\u2019s time that you let it go. He\u2019s moving on with his life, and you\u2019re starting to look real stalkerish with the number of times you mention his name in interviews as if he\u2019s still pining away for you.\n\nStep up your tanning game and worry about your own shit. According to the latest polls, half of America can\u2019t stand you, and trust me when I tell you that Obama is in that half. He doesn\u2019t want to see you fail or win; in fact\u2014and this may be the hardest part to swallow\u2014he doesn\u2019t care about anything you\u2019re doing because he doesn\u2019t fuck with you.

But while it\u2019s burning, do us all a favor and stop with the conspiracy theories. He isn\u2019t calling your phone and hanging up. He isn\u2019t checking your Twitter feed to see what you\u2019ve posted. He doesn\u2019t fuck with you, and it\u2019s time to move on and keep his name off your lips.

Because of his celebrity, though, Brown will never truly go away. Still, with his most recent disturbing headline, it\u2019s time to internalize En Vogue\u2019s \u201cGive It Up, Turn It Loose.\u201d We\u2019ll always have \u201cYo (Excuse Me Miss),\u201d \u201cTake You Down,\u201d \u201cDamage\u201d and \u201cFine China,\u201d but for those who continue to hold out hope that Brown will rise above his problems, it\u2019s time to pop, lock and drop into reality.\n\nOn Tuesday, TMZ reported that Brown\u2019s former girlfriend Karrueche Tran filed legal documents accusing Brown of threatening to kill her. Additionally, Tran claims that Brown has physically assaulted her in the past. And suddenly I now want to get up and do Soulja Boy\u2019s Superman dance.\n\nPer TMZ:\n\nKarrueche claims in a sworn statement to the judge, earlier this month Chris \u201ctold a few people that he was going to kill me.\u201d She then says Chris told the friends if he can\u2019t have her then no one else can, threatening he was going to \u201ctake me out\u201d and \u201cthreatened to shoot me.\u201d Karrueche also says several years ago Chris \u201cpunched me in my stomach twice,\u201d and \u201cpushed me down the stairs.\u201d This would have been during the time Chris was on probation for the Rihanna beating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTran also claims that Brown has threatened her friends and recently threw a drink at one of them. So, not only is this man Light, Bright Ike, but he\u2019s part-time vintage Evelyn Lozada from Basketball Wives.\n\nIn any case, the judge granted said domestic violence restraining order, requiring Brown to stay 100 yards away from Tran, her mom and her brother.\n\nIn response, Brown took to Instagram to try to clear his name while simultaneously confirming your worst suspicions about his state of mind as he rambled rather incoherently. Forgoing a publicist and lawyer, Brown said, \u201cMake sure y\u2019all don\u2019t be listening to all this bullshit man. I don\u2019t know what the fuck they\u2019re talking about. Don\u2019t believe all that bullshit, bro.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis comments might have come across as more convincing had he not delivered them in a manner that recalls a kite flying high in the clear blue sky.\n\n\n\nOf the many problems Chris Brown has, one in particular is his unfortunate habit of documenting his bad decisions and erratic behavior for all to see. Less than a month ago, Brown took to Al Gore\u2019s internet and recorded himself sounding like the very violent menace his ex-girlfriend is accusing him to be. Do people not realize that when it comes to sharing videos on the internet, 1) we can see you and 2) the internet is forever?\n\nIn that now infamous clip in which he looked like the lost cousin of Kris Kross, Brown said:\n\n\n\nLadies y\u2019all be complaining about niggas being like stalkers, in love with y\u2019all, kinda crazy shit, and get tired of \u2019em. Well guess what? I\u2019m one of them niggas. If I love you, bitch, ain\u2019t nobody gon\u2019 have ya. I\u2019mma make ya miserable. I\u2019mma chase that nigga out, I\u2019mma chase yo ass around. Ladies, y\u2019all ever dealt with a nigga who just be blowin\u2019 your shit up? Hopping gates, stalking the fuck out of you, getting on your nerves? Well, shit. I\u2019m one of them niggas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now he is being accused not only of additional physical abuse years after he beat another now-former girlfriend, Rihanna, but also of living up to the very abusive stalker he boldly professed himself to be on camera.\n\nFor years now, fans and other sympathizers have rallied behind Brown. Some have made excuses for his behavior. In many cases it was a matter of victim-blaming, though in others, Brown\u2019s having witnessed domestic violence as a child was cited as a reason to hold out hope that he would one day get himself together. That he would own his mistakes and ultimately overcome whatever internal demons and the childhood trauma that helped create them.\n\n\n\nBut as someone who is not unfamiliar with some of what Brown has spoken of previously, there comes a point when you realize that some people are simply stuck. Maybe critics\u2014self included\u2014were too harsh on him. Perhaps more people needed to give him a chance to redeem himself. There were instances in which it seemed as if Brown was damned if he did, damned if he didn\u2019t.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNevertheless, Brown has largely been the maker of his own madness.\n\nChris Brown never let go of the misogyny. In fact, he continued to profit from it in his music. Chris Brown remained defensive more often than not about his repeating the very cycle of abuse he was exposed to as a kid. Chris Brown never stopped battling people, be it online or in person. Chris Brown has exhibited violence for several years.\n\nBrown is a man of means; he has refused to use his blessings to become a better, happier and less terrorizing man. Brown can call Karrueche Tran\u2019s accusations \u201cbullshit,\u201d but he\u2019s given us countless examples of why we should believe every single thing she told that judge. Even now, I can recall the sight of Brown following Tran outside a club in 2015\u2014which at the time was reported to have resulted in an argument.\n\n\n\nLook at him. Look at her. Look at the fear in her eyes. Look at the traits of an abuser on full display without the slightest sign of shame.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t know what will become of Brown, but I do know that not a song in the world can excuse him anymore. Whatever emotional attachment people have to him because of his work, it is not enough when considering that he is on camera boasting about stalking someone for no other reason than her rightly deciding that he doesn\u2019t deserve her.\n\nBrown\u2019s debut album was released in 2005. We learned that he beat women in 2009. Seven years later, he\u2019s being accused of the same thing, and throughout these seven years, he has shown himself to be more like Eddie from The Five Heartbeats than Michael from the Jackson 5. Let him go.\n\n\n\nIf anything, now is the time to focus less on Brown\u2019s dedication to self-destruction and more on the havoc he brings to others who enter his space.\n\n", "keywords": ["chris", "yall", "turner", "stop", "told", "refuses", "tran", "look", "dont", "violence", "acting", "brown", "bright", "light", "man", "shit", "ike"], "polarity": 0.01653374711708045, "subjectivity": 0.48321102971102975},

The entire event was organized by 50 Cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoulja Boy went on a little Twitter rant about the situation, but there\u2019s no word from Breezy yet as far as the eye can see. Maybe he\u2019s learning to disengage for 2017.\n\nAh well, on to the next one.", "keywords": ["boxing", "chris", "went", "asses", "supposed", "vegas", "word", "boy", "laugh", "soulja", "brown", "tyson", "match", "canceled", "event", "longer"], "polarity": -0.0005952380952380931, "subjectivity": 0.3630952380952381},

Kim Kimble was a star hairstylist long before her WeTV show L.A. Hair debuted in 2012, and she\u2019s still one today. Her receipts run deep: Yes, she\u2019s even slayed Queen Bey. Multiple times. On tour. Lemonade. Going way back to Austin Powers in Goldmember.\n\nAnd those bold, blond tresses on Oprah for the Ava DuVernay-directed A Wrinkle in Time? Those are the extra-platinum receipts. Like the hair boss she is, Kimble was in charge of all the unbeweaveable action in AWIT. Yep, That\u2019s Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Storm Reid and the whole shebang.\n\nIn the Disney big-screen adaptation of Madeleine L\u2019Engle\u2019s classic 1962 novel, a girl named Meg Murry, along with adopted brother Charles Wallace and friend Calvin O\u2019Keefe, sets out to find her scientist dad aided by celestial aides, but Hollywood and Kim Kimble found each other much more easily.\n\nKimble got her first film break creating hairstyles for the zany 1997 film B*A*P*S. And in a glimpse of things to come, her outrageous hair flair even landed the Chicago-born, Los Angeles-made hair artist on what else? The Oprah Winfrey Show!\n\nPhoto: DAndre Michael Inc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, this isn\u2019t the first time Kimble has crossed paths with director DuVernay, either. DuVernay is a former client and collaborator on other (smaller) projects. So when DuVernay called Kimble about the $100 million Wrinkle, she minced no words: \u201cYou want to be a part of this project, because the hair is really creative. And this is something you really want to do, because it\u2019s going to be Oscar-worthy hair!\u201d\n\n\n\nHow could the hair star not be all in? And when The Glow Up caught up with Kimble in Atlanta last month, as she was closing out appearances at the Bronner Bros. International Beauty Show (which we casually know as a \u201chair show\u201d\u2014shoutout to Chris Rock\u2019s Good Hair), she dished all things hair and AWIT.\n\nOn from B*A*P*S to AWIT:\n\nI used to do a lot of fantasy hair competitions, and [director] Robert Townsend picked hairstyles I had done before in shows [for B*A*P*S]. [For Wrinkle], I had to be more creative, and I had to really search more on what to do with the hair because I really didn\u2019t have anything to reference other than the book, and these were women from the universe. And what does a woman from the universe look like? There\u2019s no real reference to that, but it was fun creating that. So I wanted something and Ava [also] wanted something that was more avant-garde, but something that was also kind of couture but very fashionable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn creating the looks for each Mrs.:\n\nI had to do a couple of meetings with Ava. That gave me ideas of how far she wanted to go with the look, and basically coming up with the color for each person. We went through, I want to say, 200 tear sheets of just ideas, and then it was very difficult to narrow down which looks, but we had to collaborate with the clothes and makeup. We had to all kind of work together to create the image of what this was going to look like because we didn\u2019t want the hair competing with the clothes, and it needed to be cohesive and go together. It took a while for the clothes to really come together, so we put some ideas out there. Then, once I got to see the clothes, I pulled from the ideas that I thought would work best with the clothes. And then we did camera tests. So we got to actually see the clothes and the hair and the makeup altogether.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Disney\n\nOn Oprah\u2019s Mrs. Which hair and what it means:\n\nTo me, I call her \u201cthe diva of the universe.\u201d Her clothes are metallic. Her hair color was metallic. We blended like platinum, gold and a little bit of bronze ... we custom-made all her hair. She was like, \u201cI don\u2019t want my ordinary color. I want something really different.\u201d Out of all the colors, this one was, to me, the most striking, and it was very soft and beautiful on her. And then, of course, her hair was big and in textures, so we did a lot of curls and big hair. She had like a long braid at one point. So I just look at her like she\u2019s the diva of the universe and her hair is made up of minerals of the earth. That\u2019s why platinum, gold and bronze and those things blended together made up her hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Mindy Kaling\u2019s Mrs. Who hair:\n\nHer hair color didn\u2019t really change, but what was different about her is that she had a lot of texture going on. She had little braids. Her thing was more cultural. So she was all these different cultures. Like Asian, African, Spanish, Indian; all these different cultures kind of made up Mrs. Who. If you look at her clothes, she\u2019s like a quilt of just everything, and that was sort of the idea behind her image and her look. If you noticed, she had a lot of braided stuff and sculpted hairstyles.\n\nOn Reese Witherspoon\u2019s Mrs. Whatsit hair:\n\nShe was more earthy but, yet, a little fiery. She was a bit more whimsical and kind of quirky, in a way. She\u2019s almost like a flower child with a little fire, I guess. Red was something I thought was very different for Reese. ... We really wanted to create this whole other image. I didn\u2019t want you to look at her and see Reese. I wanted you to look at her and see a different person. The same thing with Oprah and Mindy. You wanted to see, like, a completely different person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn styling Storm Reid\u2019s natural hair for Meg Murry:\n\nWe did take some things from the book because Ava, you know, she wanted to definitely be able to connect with fans of the book. The character, she had curly hair also. But, also, I thought this was a great way to go because natural hair is such a big thing and it\u2019s such a big statement. I love that women are starting to embrace and understand how to deal with [natural hair] because, for years, we didn\u2019t even know how to deal with natural hair. But her having natural hair, naturally curly hair, is great ...\n\nPhoto: Disney\n\nI think it\u2019s good for young girls to be able to look up to someone and to see this young African-American woman starring in a big film having natural hair. It\u2019s going to be great for young women to identify. Even though I do feel like this newer generation is understanding more about natural hair and embracing it more, it\u2019s great to see that on the big screen. Because for years, you had to have straight hair to be on TV. Natural hair wasn\u2019t accepted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn how AWIT even wowed her:\n\nThere was so much women power on this movie. [You had] Ava directing this big film and you got Mindy, Oprah and Reese. They\u2019re acting in this movie, but Oprah has her own network and she\u2019s got several films she\u2019s produced. Reese produced Big Little Lies and then Mindy producing her own shows. These women are powerhouses. Being able to work around these women, I loved that energy! It was just powerhouses of women throughout the whole project.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: We know you love to support black films, so let\u2019s show Hollywood that they count.

{"url": "https://www.theroot.com/7-arguments-i-wish-people-would-stop-using-to-defend-th-1790856600", "title": "/7-arguments-i-wish-people-would-stop-using-to-defend-th-", "text": "I spend a great deal of my day trying to figure out what to write about for my next story. Luckily for me, there's rarely a day that passes without a hot-button issue being debated on one of my many social media timelines.\n\nOver the last couple of weeks, I've spent a great deal of time, perhaps more than usual, \"exchanging ideas\" about issues surrounding Gabrielle Douglas, Nate Parker, Chris Brown, Colin Kaepernick and more. I've noticed some repetitive counterarguments that often derail otherwise substantive conversations. I mean, that is the point, isn't it?\n\nI rounded up a few of the most frequent (and illogical) ways uncomfortable (or sadistic) commenters ruin productive discussions:\n\n\n\n1. \"Why now?\"\n\nThis is the go-to line for Bill Cosby apologists and Parker defenders. They want to know why Cosby's accusers came forward after decades of silence. Or why Parker's rape trial is being discussed now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I just want to know, \"Why not now?\" You can't be charged with certain alleged crimes after a certain amount of time, but we can't discuss them, either, even when the story is currently in the news cycle? Even when a celebrity sits for interviews about his misdeeds? Should we all consult our calendars for an undefined expiration date before caring or commenting?\n\nIf an alleged victim doesn't speak up immediately, then she should take it to her grave? Is that how this works? If a heinous crime is alleged to have taken place and there's been no past accountability, is time a get-out-of-anyone-having-an-opinion free card?\n\nSomeone let me know. I'm confused.\n\n\n\n2. \"But white people allow it/don't do \u2026 \"\n\nWhite people are not the gold standard. I repeat: White people are not the gold standard. That there are moviegoers who turn a blind eye to Woody Allen or Roman Polanski, or who separate the man from his work of art, isn't a valid reason for black people to look past the shenanigans or crimes allegedly or actually committed by another black person. We ain't gotta \"follow the leader.\" We can think independently and hold black folk accountable when necessary.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \"Don't judge/Only God can judge.\"\n\nOut of all the responses, this one irritates me the most. To judge, by Merriam-Webster's definition, is to form an opinion or draw a conclusion. We all judge. All of us. All the time. And that includes the \"Don't judge\" people. They just can't articulate a proper argument to defend their point of view, or they're guilty of similar behavior. Instead of admitting that, they get on the moral high horse and try to shame into silence folks who are using their brains. It's sooooo annoying, but rarely works.\n\n\n\n4. \"There are more important topics, like \u2026 \"\n\nIn fairness, discussing the fit or pattern of Cam Newton's pants doesn't compare, in terms of importance, to, say, poverty, racism or rape. But if you see that's the topic of discussion and you think it's wack, why didn't you keep scrolling?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd yes, folks can discuss Cam's pants one minute and #BlackLivesMatter the next. It's not as if folks get one opinion a day and they've wasted it frivolously on fashion.\n\nThis argument is even worse when folks actually are discussing an important topic such as racism or sexism or rape, and someone jumps in to say they should be talking about something else. Without fail, when folks are discussing police brutality, there's always someone who wants the whole discussion to cease and switch to \u201cblack-on-black\u201d crime. Women discussing sexism or rape? There's always that one person who jumps in wanting to talk about black folk uniting to fight the Man instead.\n\nYou passionately feel what you want to talk about needs a voice? Start your own #hashtag or thread so you can be heard.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. \"Y\u2019all just hating.\"\n\nNow, sometimes this one is appropriate, such as when you stumble upon a thread discussing the state of Gabrielle Douglas' hair while she is competing. Other times, this is thrown out because the commenter has a lack of anything intelligent to add to the conversation and a desire to invalidate all naysayers. To quote the great street prophet Common, \"If I don't like it, I don't like it/Doesn't mean that I'm hating.\" If you like something and the person or group you're engaging with doesn't, just state your support and your reasons for enjoying. Or even better, keep scrolling.\n\n\n\n6. \"It's a conspiracy \u2026 \"\n\nThis one drives me nuts, too, but it actually holds some weight right now. That girl who said Chris Brown pulled a gun on her and she had to run for her life, I mean, after she got her phone back? She wasn't in collusion with the feds to take down Brown, but that situation sounds more and more like a setup. Y\u2019all won this round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I still want to say this: Your favorite celeb who suddenly has been humbled and dragged probably isn't the victim of a conspiracy. It's more likely that a series of bad decisions finally caught up with him or her, and it's harder to bury a story in the age of social media and blogs.\n\n\n\n7. \"It's the woman's fault \u2026 \"\n\nSadly, I've come to expect this from men and women alike when it comes to any form of abuse happening to a woman. But the frequency of this argument and how some folk will apply it to just any situation just baffles me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was part of a conversation recently about the \"media's emasculation of black men\" as inspired by Yung Joc's permed hair and Young Thug's album cover. I don't get the rationale, but I read through the comments to understand the perspective. I stopped when I got to a guy blaming man-perms and men in dresses on women. Apparently, women like and encourage these expressions, and men want to attract women, so if women didn't encourage it, men wouldn't do this.\n\nHuh? Young Thug wants to dress up like Scarlett O'Hara and that's my fault? Naw. That grown man decided to wear that dress. And if he's happy in it, I'm happy for him. But wearing that dress is solely on him.\n\nI find often that it's the most \"I am man, hear me roar, let me lead\"-type guys that refuse to hold other men accountable for anything. It's always, \"A woman made him do it.\" And I always wonder if they realize how weak it makes men sound. Like, if everything you do is because of a woman, you're a follower. Just get out the way, stop yelling about submission, and just let the folks who are already leading go on and do what they do without all the complaining.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBonus: \"You're a Negro bed wench.\"\n\nThis one is reserved for black women who dare to call themselves feminists and/or use words like \"privilege\" and \"misogynoir\" and/or don't rush to defend black men who have found themselves in a media scandal. if you believed the 60 women who accused Cosby of nefarious sexual conduct, thought Nate Parker was anything less than completely innocent or have expressed an unwillingness to attend an R. Kelly concert, you may have found this comment in your social media mentions.\n\nThis is a clear sign of a person who hates black women. There is no reasoning with the speaker, usually a man. Just block and report him for harassment. You're probably not the first person to whom he's said it. Maybe with enough complaints, the social media platform will ban his account and you'll be the last.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemetria Lucas D\u2019Oyley is a contributing editor at The Root, a life coach and the author of Don\u2019t Waste Your Pretty: The Go-to Guide for Making Smarter Decisions in Life & Love as well as A Belle in Brooklyn: The Go-to Girl for Advice on Living Your Best Single Life.

Christian Siriano and Tadashi Shoji have both become reliable industry sources for all-inclusive glamour, but Spencer nailed her look Sunday night courtesy of one of our fashion faves, Brandon Maxwell (who also dressed best actress winner Alison Janney and our hilarious homegirl Tiffany Haddish for the Vanity Fair after-party Sunday night). In a lovely Instagram post, Maxwell wrote:\n\nI am very proud, with my team, to have dressed Best Supporting Actress nominee @octaviaspencer in a custom emerald green satin faced organza gown for Tonight\u2019s 90th Annual Academy Awards. Octavia makes history tonight with her third nomination, and we are beyond honored to be a part of her special moment.\n\nWhat we loved about this dress is how well the belted silhouette and full, flowing skirt highlighted Spencer\u2019s curvy figure, as well as the deep emerald green, which played to perfection against her brown skin\u2014which we were thrilled to see more of on display. But our favorite aspect by far was the off-the-shoulder neckline, which framed her beautiful face and shoulders, which were grazed by a wavy bob, styled by celebrity hairstylist and groomer David Stanwell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanwell began working with Spencer five years ago while at the Cannes Film Festival to promote Fruitvale Station. He says he hit it off with the acclaimed actress the moment they met, telling The Glow Up: \u201cShe has a great sense of humor, and we always have a fun time together. She is professional, and all those elements make for a good work environment.\u201d\n\nThis awards season, Spencer\u2019s hair\u2014which Stanwell tells us is naturally curly and pressed out\u2014has consistently looked stunning, with the actress frequently rocking loose waves to accent her array of red-carpet looks. Stanwell tells us:\n\nOctavia loves curls in the hair\u2014big, medium, and sometimes smaller! We always opt for curls going away from [the] face, and we alternate the tightness depending upon the size of the curling iron. The only time we don\u2019t curl is if we do a slicked-back look with a bun or ponytail. As most award shows are long, we like to stick to simple and practical looks, yet still with a glamorous edge without being too fussy. Our influence always comes from classic and elegant so we always end up in that wheelhouse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Tristan Fewings (Getty Images)\n\nWhile Stanwell is always willing to gently push his star client to try something new and different, he\u2019s also very respectful of her comfort zone and happiness on the red carpet. But when Stanwell saw a sketch of Spencer\u2019s 2018 Oscar gown, he was inspired to take her look shorter to keep the shoulders bare, telling us:\n\nOctavia had sent me the sketch of her dress [last] week, which helped spark my inspiration for [Sunday night\u2019s] look. Instantly, I knew I wanted to do a side part, so that one side was off the shoulder to compliment her dress and jewelry. Octavia liked the idea of a curl, but not too brushed out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanwell says his secret to keeping Spencer\u2019s hair looking glamorous and healthy is simpler\u2014and far less expensive\u2014than one might think. For Spencer, he\u2019s been relying on a variety of Dove hair products, which, in his words, \u201c[have] helped with that shine and healthy glow that we all want for our hair.\u201d\n\nWe were curious, so he graciously gave The Glow Up a how-to on Spencer\u2019s wavy Oscars bob:\n\n\u201cI started prepping the hair by mixing Dove Style + Care Smooth & Shine Heat Protection Spray and a dollop of Dove Absolute Curls Supreme Cr\u00e8me Serum together to moisturize her hair before applying any heat.\n\n\u201cUsing a large, round brush, I blow-dried her hair to create the desired face-framing shape. We decided on taking the hair shorter [for the night], so after I blow-dried it, I made a deep side part to add more definition to the look.\n\n\u201cAfter I finished blow-drying the hair, I went through it with a 1-inch curling iron to create glamorous, defined waves by twisting the hair toward her face.\n\n\u201cWhile the hair was cooling, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray to give it that extra hold before running my hands through to break up the curls. [Pro tip: Waiting until the hair is cool enough to run one\u2019s fingers through it gives it a fabulous curl that will last all night long.]\n\n\u201cAfter shaping the hair and dressing it around her face, I tucked the curls on the right side of her face behind her ear to give it a romantic feel and show off her jewelry. To finish, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray again throughout the hair to give it a boost of shine.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have to give credit to Stanwell and Spencer\u2019s entire glam squad for giving one of our screen queens the Cinderella moment she so richly deserved. It\u2019s always exciting to see a star\u2019s style evolve, and while Spencer isn\u2019t known for glamorous roles, we\u2019re hoping to see these gorgeous, age-appropriate (and subtly sexy!) red-carpet moments continue for her. Like the awards she\u2019s frequently nominated for, she deserves them.", "keywords": ["glamorous", "proves", "market", "hollywood", "corner", "spencers", "glamour", "dont", "curls", "octavia", "ingenues", "spencer", "hair", "night", "stanwell", "style", "dove", "glow", "actress"], "polarity": 0.26060511458238733, "subjectivity": 0.5172534094693186},

That's the answer you're going to give? You're going to sit up here and pretend that Kyrie isn't your favorite player in the league, and that you haven't been writing about him since 2012?\n\nI didn't think that was relevant information today.\n\nWhatever, man. Anyway, who is Kehlani?\n\nKehlani is a young woman who, apparently, sings songs. I wish I had more to tell you about the names of her songs or perhaps the types of songs she sings, but I'd have to google it. Which means you'd find out just as quickly as I would.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOkay. Well, who is PartyNextDoor?\n\nPartyNextDoor could literally be performing right now at a party next door \u2014 with a note on my door letting me know PartyNextDoor will be at a party next door this morning \u2014 and I still wouldn't know who he was. I'd just be annoyed my neighbors were having a party at 11am.\n\nSo\u2026you get paid to follow and write about pop culture, right?\n\nI do.\n\nAnd you don't know who these people are?\n\nI don't. I'm not going to lie and say that I do. Have I heard the names \"Kehlani\" and \"PartyNextDoor\" before? Yes I have. Do I know why these are names I've heard before? No I don't.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOkay. Well, who is Chris Brown?\n\nChris Brown is light-skinned.\n\nWhy are we talking about them today?\n\nWell, my entry point into all of this came Monday afternoon, when I noticed Kyrie's name was the top trending topic. This immediately sent a chill through my spine, because if an athlete's name is trending while there are no games being played, it's usually because something bad happened to him. An arrest, perhaps. Or maybe a drug suspension. And, knowing what I know about Kyrie's extensive (and annoyingly random) injury history, my first fear was that he contracted knee AIDS or something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKnee AIDS? Really?\n\nLook, this is a dude who broke his toe in college while making a cut, broke his hand the summer after his rookie season slapping a wall, and broke his kneecap last summer after bumping into a guy who's literally made out of water. Knee AIDS isn't really that far-fetched.\n\nAnyway, he was actually trending because Kehlani \u2014 who Kyrie was apparently dating \u2014 was apparently cheating on him. And the internet decided to have quite a bit of fun at Kyrie's expense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait\u2026how did the internet find out about Kehlani's alleged infidelity?\n\nPartyNextDoor \u2014 who happened to be Kehlani's ex \u2014 posted a photo on Instagram of them in bed together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI see. Well, why do you keep using words like \"apparently\" and \"alleged?\" Everything seems pretty clear here. Kyrie was dating a woman (Kehlani) who cheated on him with her ex (PartyNextDoor). The ex provided photo evidence. There's not much ambiguity here.\n\nActually, there is. We have no idea whether Kyrie and Kehlani were still seeing each other. Although their relationship was public, it's very possible that they broke up privately. The only person definitely in the wrong here is PartyNextDoor.\n\nHow so?\n\nWhether Kehlani and Kyrie were actually still dating or not, people who knew of the relationship assumed they were. And sharing a photo like that is the pinnacle of passive-aggressive fuckboytivity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich, to be fair, shouldn't have been a big surprise.\n\nWhy not?\n\nBecause he's an OVO artist. And OVO is Drake's label. And Drake is the patron saint of passive-aggressive fuckboytivity. Ultimately, PartyNextDoor was just acting out what happens in literally every single Drake verse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat happened next?\n\nAyesha Curry's name started trending. Again.\n\nWait\u2026what? Why the hell did that happen?\n\nBecause whenever a young and famous Black man who is dating a woman experiences any type of relationship-related adversity, Ayesha Curry's name is dropped as an example of the \"type of female these thoterrific bitches need to be.\" As I tweeted Monday evening, she's the Hotep Twitter Candyman. Say her name in the mirror five times and ashy elbows will appear.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, what happened after that?\n\nThings got a quite a bit more serious early Tuesday as Kehlani shared a photo of her in a hospital room, with a caption suggesting she attempted to commit suicide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWow. That's really sad.\n\nIt is. And the sadness turned surreal when #StayStrongKehlani became the top trending topic just hours after she was getting shaded by every corner of the internet. Which is like wearing a RIP shirt to honor someone you just shot. There's a cognitive dissonance that seems to exist within internet shade culture. Yes, the memes can be funny and clever, but I think we forget sometimes that there are actual people at the receiving end of these jokes. Actual people who could be so upset by it that they're driven to the type of depression that makes them consider ending their own lives.\n\nSo, I noticed Chris Brown's name is in the title. How did he get involved with all of this?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarly Wednesday morning, Brown tweeted that he believed Kehlani's suicide attempt was an inauthentic ploy for attention.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy would Chris Brown even feel the need to chime in here?\n\nAsking why Chris Brown does what Chris Brown does is like asking my four-month-old daughter why she smiles at clocks. It's like he has a timer that goes off every six months to remind him to remind us he's a 26-year-old six-year-old. If Drake is the patron saint of passive-aggressive but relatively harmless fuckboytivity, Chris Brown is fuckboy emertus.\n\nI do know however that Chris Brown and Kyrie Irving are apparently good friends. And that, considering the history between Chris Brown and Drake, he's probably not too fond of Drake-related artists. So there's that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, I have to admit something. It seemed kind of fishy for Kehlani to share a photo of herself in the hospital after her suicide attempt. I know listening to Chris Brown is like listening to a genital wart, but I think he has a point here.\n\nWas Chris Brown the only person to be a bit skeptical about how genuine Kehlani's suicide attempt was? No, he wasn't. But we don't know what's going on in that young woman's head. None of us do. And when something as serious as suicide is on the table, we have to give her the benefit of the doubt. If there's even a 1% chance she's sincere, it needs to be treated like a 100% chance.\n\nSaying someone faked a suicide attempt and questioning their authenticity is ultimately an implicit way of daring them to try again. And someone as famous as Chris Brown doing it with the ginormous platform he has is dangerous, disgusting, and possibly even criminal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, \"seeking attention\" and \"being suicidal\" are qualities that can exist at the same time. The presence of one doesn't negate the presence of the other. Perhaps she did share that picture to elicit sympathy, but that doesn't mean she didn't legitimately want to kill herself.\n\nGenerally speaking, we don't know shit about mental health. And the conversations that tend to surround these types of topics are examples of that.\n\nSo what happens next?\n\nI have no idea. All I do know is that these are all exceedingly young people. Kyrie just turned 24. Kehlani is 20. PartyNextDoor is 22. Chris Brown is 26. And I do not envy the generation who has to go through their teens and 20s \u2014 and all the perfectly normal relationship-related fuckshit that occurs when you're a teenager and a young adult \u2014 with every move they make documented on social media.", "keywords": ["kyrie", "chris", "suicide", "apparently", "partynextdoor", "explained", "going", "know", "kehlani", "brown", "irving", "trending", "wtf", "young"], "polarity": 0.05739247311827955, "subjectivity": 0.4823284690220173},

Sitting there in the theater, gazing up at the gorgeous Dora Milaje, the thought occurred to you at least once: Could I pull off a bald head?\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nMaybe your answer was an immediate and unequivocal \u201cNo,\u201d but if there was even a glimmer of curiosity, let\u2019s dig into it. While women have been rocking baldies and fades for centuries now, our hair is often still considered our \u201ccrowning glory.\u201d But is the crown really what\u2019s on your head, or what\u2019s in it?\n\nWith the ongoing popularity of Marvel\u2019s Black Panther, we got not only an eyeful of epic black excellence and battle scenes, but also a bevy of bald beauties, courtesy of Wakanda\u2019s royal guard, the Dora Milaje, led by General Okoye (played by Danai Gurira), who sports not only a clean-shaven head but a tattooed one.\n\nMuch to our delight, long after shooting wrapped, Gurira continued to have fun with the look in real life; even taking to having designs etched into her reverse bald fade, which she rocked to glamorous effect at the Black Panther European premiere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Gareth Cattermole (Getty Images for Disney)\n\nBut for those of us who aren\u2019t starring in the latest Hollywood blockbuster, is this a look we can realistically pull off? To find out, we reached out to one of our favorite bald beauties, psychiatrist and occasional contributor to The Root, Dr. Imani J. Walker.\n\n\n\nWalker began shaving her head at about the age of 17 while an incoming freshman at Xavier University in New Orleans. Originally arriving at school with the popular \u201990s-era permed-and-cropped cut made famous by Halle Berry, Walker tells The Glow Up that she quickly found the need for a drastic change:\n\nSo, I got down to New Orleans, and it was like 90-something degrees and 120 percent humidity, and my hair was just\u2014I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t happening. I\u2019m not looking cute right now.\u201d And then, my roommate at the time, when we met, we had the exact same haircut. And I was like, OK; out of necessity and also because I just hate doing what everybody else is doing, I just cut it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat \u201cbig chop\u201d led to what has become Walker\u2019s trademark look for the past 25 years, a gleaming bald head she shaves every other day. A very active mom and wife on top of her duties as a doctor, she credits her choice of hairstyle\u2014or lack thereof\u2014with making her busy lifestyle simpler.\n\nI\u2019m fairly active\u2014I work out a good six, if not seven, days a week. So one of the things I really love about it is the fact that it\u2019s not, there\u2019s not anything that I have to really be concerned about ... but also on top of that, [if I\u2019m] jumping in the pool, or I\u2019m the middle of the street and the wind blows, it feels really just nice. It\u2019s just a really refreshing feeling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker also admits to us that her personal affinity for baldness is as psychological as it is physical:\n\n\n\nI guess, spiritually speaking, I\u2019ve always felt the need [for] my thoughts to be as close to the air as possible; I just need to feel like I have freedom of thought. And for me, that physically just means having the freedom to be able to have my scalp exposed to as many elements possible. But I think more than anything, I like the way it feels, and it just so happens to look good.\n\nBut Walker warns that while lower maintenance, choosing to go bald doesn\u2019t mean no maintenance. She indulges in a strict skin and scalp regimen to keep her look smooth and free of razor bumps, emphasizing that \u201cyou have to give it as much thought as you would give any type of hairstyle.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does she keep her dome glowing? By taking extreme care with the tools and products she uses. \u201cYou can\u2019t just take Barbasol shaving cream or some plastic cheap razor and just go to your head; you\u2019ll destroy your scalp,\u201d she warns. \u201cYou\u2019ll have razor bumps forever, and it\u2019s not going to be cute.\u201d\n\nTo keep her close shave extra-cute, Walker has her routine down to a science:\n\nFirst, using a barber-grade Wahl trimmer, like the GroomsMan T-Pro, specially made to give a bump-free shave, Walker shaves her entire head.\n\n\n\nNext, she goes over her head with a set of clippers\u2014she likes Wahl\u2019s Ultra Close Cut Pro, crafted specifically for close shaves but less likely to cause razor bumps. While, technically, she has a very close shave, Walker says, \u201cTo the naked eye, it looks like my head is shining.\u201d\n\nAfter shaving, Walker oil cleanses her scalp, stressing that she treats her scalp the way she treats her face, first applying an oil cleanser that she wipes off with a hot washcloth, followed by a turmeric mask to her face and scalp, which helps to decrease inflammation, and does double duty against pimples and razor bumps. Walker\u2019s homemade mask includes turmeric powder, yogurt, rosewater and lemon juice.\n\nOnce out the shower, she applies a toner with salicylic acid, which she says is \u201cvery exciting in a tingling, like, \u2018Oh my God,\u2019 kind of a way\u2014but the tingle at least lets me know that it works!\u201d Afterward, she recommends using a hydrocortisone or steroid cream on the scalp to help nip any inflammation or razor bumps in the bud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker follows this regimen religiously, shaving only every other day to cut down on irritation and get the best results.\n\nBut while Walker absolutely loves her look, she admits that she\u2019s used to getting stares from those who are unaccustomed to seeing a bald woman, which is why it was so refreshing to see the similarly styled Dora Milaje on-screen.\n\n\u201cI went to go see the movie with my son, and we talked a little bit about it after the movie, and he was like, \u2018Well, yeah, it\u2019s like an army of my mom. This is great ... it\u2019s like having my mom, but, like, 10 of them. This is amazing.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those who think a woman going bald compromises her femininity, the doctor has this to say:\n\nFemininity to a lot of people equates with being soft. Femininity to me is the ability to have the option to be soft\u2014the option to be whatever you want\u2014but more importantly, it\u2019s to be a woman and powerful. So I feel very feminine with my head shaved ... I\u2019d feel less feminine if I wore a wig or if my bald head were not on display every day. This is my head. I do what I want to do with it. And if they don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s not really my problem. ... But anybody who doesn\u2019t feel that this look is feminine, I think, needs to really re-evaluate what their insecurities are, and why they would feel the need to place their insecurities on someone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because Walker isn\u2019t the only bald baddie in our midst, we did a little roundup of a few of our other favorite beauties who\u2019ve dared to go bare\u2014or, at least, almost there.\n\nFlorence Kasumba attends the European premiere of Black Panther in London Feb. 8, 2018.

But that said, we know it\u2019s not a look every woman can pull off, as Walker aptly notes:\n\nI mean, it\u2019s not for everyone. I do think that everyone should try it, but it\u2019s not necessarily for everyone, because not [everyone\u2019s head] is necessarily evenly shaped. People have asked me \u201cWell, how did you know what your head was going to look like?\u201d I don\u2019t know, I just did it. Just do it. Just try it and see. The worst-case scenario, your hair is going to grow back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, what do you say? Do you dare to go bare?

I mean, we know she\u2019s an Oakland, Calif., native, and a child model-turned-Disney starlet. We know she appeared on Dancing With the Stars before scoring the coveted role of M.J. in the latest installment of the Spider-Man franchise. We even know she\u2019s also a singer whose 2014 single \u201cReplay\u201d hit No. 40 on the Billboard charts, and most recently she sang while swinging on a flying trapeze in Hugh Jackman\u2019s latest film, the Oscar-nominated The Greatest Showman.\n\nBut we can\u2019t really pinpoint the moment when she arrived\u2014on our radar, at least. It feels as if we just looked up one day and there she was, stunning and perfectly deserving of the spotlight. All we know is that we\u2019ve had a hard time taking our eyes off of her ever since, because she consistently gets it right on the red carpet.\n\nThe 90th annual Academy Awards ceremony was no exception. The Glow Up Facebook live thread collectively gasped when Zendaya appeared on the step-and-repeat in a one-sleeved, deep-sienna-colored chiffon gown by Giambattista Valli. (Notably, the gown beautifully photographed chocolate brown against the red carpet, then appeared a burnished burgundy against the Oscars stage set, where she was a presenter.) On another star, the voluminous silhouette might have been overwhelming, but at a willowy 5 feet 10 inches, the 21-year-old looked like a true goddess, even as an ingenue among established megastars.\n\nBut everyone knows it takes a village to raise a successful red-carpet look, and Zendaya has found a dream team in stylist Law Roach (who also styled Mary J. Blige for the evening), makeup artist Sheika Daley and hairstylist Ursula Stephen, the mastermind who created many of Rihanna\u2019s most iconic looks.\n\nTo offset the volume of her dress, Stephen chose to keep her starlet\u2019s hair stylish and simple, telling The Glow Up, \u201cZendaya and I went back and forth about her look for tonight\u2019s show, but ultimately landed on a sleek and chic top knot to enhance the elegant silhouette created by her Giambattista Valli dress.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nBut pulled-back doesn\u2019t automatically mean easy, especially when you\u2019re creating a style that has to last from the awards ceremony through the after-party. So Stephen\u2014a brand ambassador for Unilever as well as Dyson hair products\u2014gave The Glow Up her step-by-step on how to create the perfect topknot\u2014using her go-to tools and products. With most of these products available in our local drugstore, frankly, this is a high-low tutorial we can wrap our heads around. Says Stephen:\n\n\n\n\u201cI prepped Zendaya\u2019s damp hair by spritzing Dove Style + Care Smooth & Shine Heat Protection Spray [$5.99] throughout before blow-drying as straight as possible with my Dyson Supersonic hair dryer [$399.99], which was on high heat and speed.\n\n\u201cOnce the hair was dry\u2014and super shiny!\u2014I sprayed with Suave Professionals Natural Hold Compressed Micro Mist Hairspray [$3.94] and separated her hair in half from ear to ear and brushed the top section into a high ponytail, securing it with an elastic.\n\n\u201cNext, I brought the bottom section up and secured the two pieces together before twisting them up into a chic little knot, which I secured with hair pins. [Pro tip: Separating the hair into sections allows for more control over the look and ensures security through the night.]\n\n\u201cI finished the look with TRESemm\u00e9 Compressed Micro-Mist Hair Spray Hold Level 2: Smooth [$4.99] to keep strands sleek and in place all night, without the stiffness and crunch of a traditional hair spray.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Christopher Polk (Getty Images)\n\nOf course, pulling the star\u2019s hair off her face perfectly showcased a glowing face and gorgeous sienna smoky eye by makeup artist Sheika Daley. [Editor\u2019s note: The Glow Up reached out to Daley for the specific tricks and tools she used Oscar night, but as of press time, we haven\u2019t received the details.] To re-create the look, we\u2019d suggest using eye shadow colors from the Masquerade palette by Juvia\u2019s Place ($25 for a mini palette), or the Obsessions palette in Warm Brown from Huda Beauty ($27). To quickly create a sultry, smoky eye similar to Zendaya\u2019s:\n\nApply an eye shadow base or primer, to lock in color. We like Black Up\u2019s new Matte Eye Primer ($23). Apply liquid liner to the upper lash line, avoiding an obvious cat eye. Define the outer corners of each crease with a dark matte brown eye shadow shade. Using a deep mahogany shade, smoke the eye from lash to just above the crease, extending slightly at the outer ends.\n\nUse a fine brush to lightly smudge the same color on the lower lash line. Pop the inner corners of the eyes with a shimmering champagne shadow. Apply several layers of mascara\u2014making sure to avoid clumps!\n\nNeedless to say, we loved this look, not only for its drama but also for its timeless simplicity. The 90th annual Academy Awards were so filled with nostalgia that Rita Moreno even wore the dress she wore when she accepted her 1962 Oscar (and still fit in beautifully!) for West Side Story. But looking at Zendaya\u2019s gorgeous goddess-inspired glamour last night, it\u2019s hard to think that her polished, graceful beauty will ever go out of style.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nEditor\u2019s note: A previous version of this post erroneously referred to the character of M.J. as the romantic interest in Spider-Man: Homecoming.", "keywords": ["simply", "stunning", "zendaya", "look", "served", "oscars", "glamour", "know", "hair", "eye", "getty", "night", "palette", "shadow", "glow"], "polarity": 0.21726044554696233, "subjectivity": 0.5395757737892568},

Blige will attend the 90th Academy Awards not as a guest, presenter or simply a performer, but as a dual nominee for best supporting actress and best original song for Dee Rees\u2019 gripping post-World War II drama, Mudbound. It\u2019s a remarkable first-time feat for a first-time nominee; no other person has ever been nominated in an acting and song category for the same film.\n\nIn Mudbound, Blige plays Florence Jackson, the beleaguered but noble matriarch of a sharecropping family in rural Mississippi. Her stillness often anchors the film, riveting your attention to her every time she is on-screen. In the months since the film\u2019s release and growing Oscar buzz, Blige has spoken frequently about harnessing the power of her sadness from her ongoing divorce from former manager Kendu Isaacs for the role, as well as stripping down to play Florence Jackson. From Vulture:\n\nI\u2019m Mary J. Blige. I mean, like, this is what I do. I wear wigs, I wear bob wigs, and I had to completely strip down to my own natural hair texture, which I\u2019ve always been afraid of. Dee stripped me down all the way to what I truly am, and people were complimenting me. People were saying how beautiful I was. I didn\u2019t know I was that beautiful for real. You understand what I\u2019m saying? I didn\u2019t know that.\n\nTwo-time Emmy Award-winning hairstylist Lawrence Davis was instrumental in that transformational \u201cmakeunder,\u201d using both his extensive historical knowledge and incredible skill to render the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul almost unrecognizable to audiences at last year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, where Mudbound premiered. Said director Rees: \u201cThe great surprise at Sundance was that people didn\u2019t know it was her until the credits rolled.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Derek Blanks\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIntrigued by the power of Blige\u2019s natural beauty, The Glow Up had the opportunity to talk with Davis about stripping down a megastar like Mary J. Blige, whom he describes as \u201cone of the shyest women on earth ... and so super-sweet.\u201d He tells us:\n\nI remember Mary\u2019s first day coming in for a camera test; I had specific directions from Dee Rees about how she wanted Mary just to strip down. She\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t want wigs, I don\u2019t want this, I don\u2019t want that; I want it all organic.\u201d I said, \u201cYou got it.\u201d So Mary came in the trailer, and she sat in my chair, and we talked a little bit, as I was like, \u201cWell, I just need to get you to trust the process. Trust me to take you where you want to go, and if anything feels uncomfortable, we\u2019ll talk through it. So I [asked], \u2018Are you ready?\u2019 She\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m not taking my wig off in front of all these people!\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavis accommodated, clearing out the hair and makeup trailer to unmask the artist as well known for her assortment of blond coifs, lengthy manicures and thigh-high boots as for her hit-making urban ballads and bangers. Of course, Blige tried to negotiate her way into wearing a natural wig to play a sharecropper\u2019s wife, but Davis remained firm:\n\n\u201c\u2018No ... Dee wants you. She wants you to strip down,\u2019\u201d he told Blige. \u201c\u2018She don\u2019t want to see Mary; she wants to see Florence Jackson walk in there for this camera test.\u2019\u201d\n\nDavis ultimately won her trust, peeling back both wig and tracks of weave to reveal Blige\u2019s natural hair. Throughout Mudbound, audiences are seeing Blige\u2019s natural texture at work in creating humble updos and a single scene in which we see her shoulder-length hair hang free. While the star was leery at first, she soon succumbed to the process\u2014and the freedom that came from releasing the trappings of being Mary J. Blige. Says Davis:\n\nShe basically let herself go, and she became Florence right there in that trailer. And with that, it was just taking any hair she had on her head out\u2014no hair, no weave, no wig\u2014taking her nails off, her lashes off. Basically, you got organic Mary. And I would say about the second, third day, Mary was coming in the trailer full-on Afro, just totally free ... [A]nd I could definitely see that she had this freedom that she did not have day one from that point on. And with that, it just took me saying, \u201cYou\u2019re Florence Jackson.\u201d I said, \u201cFlorence, she\u2019s a woman\u2014she lives on a farm, but she takes care of herself. She washes her clothes, she washes her kids\u2019 clothes. She does the best with what she has; she\u2019s a groomed woman. She lives on a farm in the South in the \u201940s. But she takes care of herself and her family.\u201d And that\u2019s who Mary became; she became Florence Jackson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMary J.

Blige and director Dee Rees working on Mudbound (Netflix) 1 / 8\n\nAs for the personal woes that Blige was admittedly experiencing during filming, Davis says he was unaware of the specifics at the time, but definitely noticed the emotional transformation that took place:\n\n[T]here were times when I could feel the heaviness\u2014but didn\u2019t know what it was. But I will say that I literally saw that heaviness go away as she got into this character, and she came in there every day and became Florence Jackson. She started talking more, and that heaviness that was there, it disappeared during this movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs lead hairstylist on Mudbound, Davis was entirely in his element. The Baltimore native has a specific affinity for period hairstyles and has previously flexed his knowledge and skills behind the scenes of era-specific projects like The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, Bessie and Hairspray Live!\u2014for which he won the second of his two Emmys.\n\nDavis got his start in his native city, owning his own salon before making the brave choice to sell it and move to Los Angeles in 2001. Halle Berry\u2019s then-stylist Neeko Abriol gave Davis a shot in his salon, and doors immediately began to open. He has since garnered 81 film and television credits, in addition to leading the hair teams of Being Mary Jane, Greenleaf and Claws. But it is the period pieces that remain his true passion. Case in point: His current project is styling Mahershala Ali into virtuoso pianist Don Shirley for the upcoming film Green Book. As Davis tells The Glow Up:\n\nI honestly feel like I\u2019ve been reincarnated, because as long as I remember\u2014even from being a young kid\u2014I gravitated toward anything that was vintage. Vintage cars, vintage clothing; I loved thrift stores because of the vintage clothing. And when I first got a call to do a period piece, I was most excited because it got to the root of what I wanted to do. You know, hairstyling is great, and I love it. But there\u2019s something that I\u2019m drawn to when it comes to period styling. I love the authenticity of it, and how it brings forth the story and tells the story without there even being any verbiage. You can look at the person and see where they\u2019re from, or what\u2019s going on with them because of maybe the economic setting, but just the style that they\u2019re adorned with\u2014the beautiful hair, the beautiful clothes, the beautiful makeup\u2014all of that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Derek Blanks\n\nBut, specifically, Davis loves working with the natural textures of black hair, and is emphatic that it be portrayed accurately on-screen. For him, there is an eternal elegance to natural hair. He believes that natural hairstyles belong in every film and on every red carpet because they are part of our legacy of style:\n\nBlack women, even before they started pressing their hair, they basically knew how to create these wonderful shapes out of natural hair; these silhouettes and things like that that speak elegance and class without pressing it out and going bone straight and having it go silky and shiny. It just was a beautiful, beautiful thing to see. ... But we definitely have the most beautiful hair to me on earth. And you know we wear it well, and I think that in any period movie\u2014no matter what period it is\u2014I think there always should be a black woman with natural hair. ... I just feel like black hair\u2014natural hair\u2014should always be a part of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if Davis is excited about the resurgence of natural hair on-screen and on the red carpet alike, he also loves that even black women who wear wigs are gravitating toward styles with more texture in them (e.g., Viola Davis\u2019 incredible Golden Globes look this year). He predicts that at the Oscars this Sunday and many to come, we may bring even more natural styles and braided updos to the step-and-repeat, and tells us:\n\nI think women are much more open to showing exactly, you know, what\u2019s under that wig as opposed to covering up nowadays. And I look at every award show and I always see somebody come forth and say, \u201cNo, this is who I am, and this is who I have been and I want to show it.\u201d ... I think that even when other races look at us and see us out there in our natural form, they love it, because it tells them how proud we are as a people and how proud we are to show what\u2019s natural about us, and what\u2019s unique about us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly how Davis thinks it should be. For him, natural hair has always been far more than just a trend or a movement: \u201cJust call it us. ... I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a movement anymore; I just think it is reality. It\u2019s who we are, and we\u2019re proud of it.\u201d", "keywords": ["florence", "mary", "netflix", "talks", "natural", "blige", "hiphop", "lawrence", "queen", "mudbound", "j", "hair", "soul", "davis", "unmaking", "hairstylist", "beautiful"], "polarity": 0.2369808449695669, "subjectivity": 0.49995972073039713},

Marshall (Getty Images)\n\nGrammy-nominated singer, reality-television regular and Braxton-family baby sister Tamar turned heads this week when she took to Instagram to post footage of her having her head shaved with the chorus of Bobby Brown\u2019s \u201cMy Prerogative\u201d playing in the background.\n\nThe diva\u2014as well-known for her array of hairstyles as for her multioctave voice\u2014has notably been estranged from her longtime husband, manager, reality-show co-star and co-parent Vincent Herbert since last year, amid rumors of physical and emotional abuse, accusations that Braxton refuted in December.\n\nWe don\u2019t know if shedding what often looked like a toxic relationship to viewers of WeTV\u2019s Tamar & Vince led Braxton to decide to shed her locks, but it\u2019s a major change to her look, which was heavily associated with wigs and weaves. Apparently, the big chop was done in honor of her 41st birthday, tomorrow on St. Patrick\u2019s Day, which she playfully dubs \u201cSt. Tamar\u2019s Day.\u201d A post-shave Instagram post read:\n\n[I\u2019m] over feeling captive to a wig, weave, people, people\u2019s comments & opinions hell...even my OWN feelings! WE can choose to stop these things from having the power and victory over us!! And for me, that starts TODAY.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut despite Braxton\u2019s declaration of her own liberation from pervasive beauty standards, the internet, of course, had to have its say, weighing in on a topic that, frankly, no one asked its opinion on (and before you @ me with rebuttals about the price of a public image, prove you\u2019ve never posted a selfie).\n\nWhile the response to seeing Braxton\u2019s beautiful face take center stage was overwhelmingly positive, inevitably, there were a few who felt the need to try to be cute\u2014as if Braxton\u2019s bold new look wasn\u2019t cute enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScreenshot: Instagram\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople, please. It is the year 2018, and at this point, no one should have to explain why all of the above is problematic. Yes, we remember Britney Spears\u2019 infamous bald and window-bashing breakdown post-split from ex-husband Kevin Federline (and yes, we also know Spears covered \u201cMy Prerogative\u201d a few years before, but that does not an Easter egg hunt make).\n\nWe also know the bald warrior women of Black Panther\u2019s Dora Milaje are the hottest women to hit the screen so far in 2018. More importantly, we know that folks sound ass-backwards, transphobic and homophobic as hell when they compare a woman who decides to undergo the \u201cbig chop\u201d to a gender nonbinary person. Whatever kind of feelings it triggers in you, you might want to keep them to yourself, because it\u2019s not a good look, and nobody else\u2019s identity is really your business.\n\nAnd guess what? Even if you can\u2019t get over your outdated notions of sexuality and gender (and you really should, for your own sake), we also know plenty of cisgender straight men with long hair (hi, Jason Momoa) and plenty of cis straight women rocking beautiful bald fades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut none of that should really even matter. Like, for real: Grow the hell up.\n\nAs a woman who\u2019s undergone more than one big chop\u2014at times, to release the energy of the past, and sometimes solely for the sake of my hair health\u2014I can vouch that it\u2019s a very liberating experience. I can also attest that it didn\u2019t change the way I express my femininity in the least. In short (pun intended), this kind of sexist idiocy really pisses me off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPersonally, we think this is the prettiest and happiest that Tamar Braxton has looked in years\u2014and we hope she feels as good as she looks. That said, she might have a little work of her own to do, since her 4-year-old son snarkily called her \u201cMr. Mommy\u201d after seeing her new look.\n\n[Sigh.] Doing too much, indeed.

Sitting there in the theater, gazing up at the gorgeous Dora Milaje, the thought occurred to you at least once: Could I pull off a bald head?\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nMaybe your answer was an immediate and unequivocal \u201cNo,\u201d but if there was even a glimmer of curiosity, let\u2019s dig into it. While women have been rocking baldies and fades for centuries now, our hair is often still considered our \u201ccrowning glory.\u201d But is the crown really what\u2019s on your head, or what\u2019s in it?\n\nWith the ongoing popularity of Marvel\u2019s Black Panther, we got not only an eyeful of epic black excellence and battle scenes, but also a bevy of bald beauties, courtesy of Wakanda\u2019s royal guard, the Dora Milaje, led by General Okoye (played by Danai Gurira), who sports not only a clean-shaven head but a tattooed one.\n\nMuch to our delight, long after shooting wrapped, Gurira continued to have fun with the look in real life; even taking to having designs etched into her reverse bald fade, which she rocked to glamorous effect at the Black Panther European premiere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Gareth Cattermole (Getty Images for Disney)\n\nBut for those of us who aren\u2019t starring in the latest Hollywood blockbuster, is this a look we can realistically pull off? To find out, we reached out to one of our favorite bald beauties, psychiatrist and occasional contributor to The Root, Dr. Imani J. Walker.\n\n\n\nWalker began shaving her head at about the age of 17 while an incoming freshman at Xavier University in New Orleans. Originally arriving at school with the popular \u201990s-era permed-and-cropped cut made famous by Halle Berry, Walker tells The Glow Up that she quickly found the need for a drastic change:\n\nSo, I got down to New Orleans, and it was like 90-something degrees and 120 percent humidity, and my hair was just\u2014I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t happening. I\u2019m not looking cute right now.\u201d And then, my roommate at the time, when we met, we had the exact same haircut. And I was like, OK; out of necessity and also because I just hate doing what everybody else is doing, I just cut it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat \u201cbig chop\u201d led to what has become Walker\u2019s trademark look for the past 25 years, a gleaming bald head she shaves every other day. A very active mom and wife on top of her duties as a doctor, she credits her choice of hairstyle\u2014or lack thereof\u2014with making her busy lifestyle simpler.\n\nI\u2019m fairly active\u2014I work out a good six, if not seven, days a week. So one of the things I really love about it is the fact that it\u2019s not, there\u2019s not anything that I have to really be concerned about ... but also on top of that, [if I\u2019m] jumping in the pool, or I\u2019m the middle of the street and the wind blows, it feels really just nice. It\u2019s just a really refreshing feeling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker also admits to us that her personal affinity for baldness is as psychological as it is physical:\n\n\n\nI guess, spiritually speaking, I\u2019ve always felt the need [for] my thoughts to be as close to the air as possible; I just need to feel like I have freedom of thought. And for me, that physically just means having the freedom to be able to have my scalp exposed to as many elements possible. But I think more than anything, I like the way it feels, and it just so happens to look good.\n\nBut Walker warns that while lower maintenance, choosing to go bald doesn\u2019t mean no maintenance. She indulges in a strict skin and scalp regimen to keep her look smooth and free of razor bumps, emphasizing that \u201cyou have to give it as much thought as you would give any type of hairstyle.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does she keep her dome glowing? By taking extreme care with the tools and products she uses. \u201cYou can\u2019t just take Barbasol shaving cream or some plastic cheap razor and just go to your head; you\u2019ll destroy your scalp,\u201d she warns. \u201cYou\u2019ll have razor bumps forever, and it\u2019s not going to be cute.\u201d\n\nTo keep her close shave extra-cute, Walker has her routine down to a science:\n\nFirst, using a barber-grade Wahl trimmer, like the GroomsMan T-Pro, specially made to give a bump-free shave, Walker shaves her entire head.\n\n\n\nNext, she goes over her head with a set of clippers\u2014she likes Wahl\u2019s Ultra Close Cut Pro, crafted specifically for close shaves but less likely to cause razor bumps. While, technically, she has a very close shave, Walker says, \u201cTo the naked eye, it looks like my head is shining.\u201d\n\nAfter shaving, Walker oil cleanses her scalp, stressing that she treats her scalp the way she treats her face, first applying an oil cleanser that she wipes off with a hot washcloth, followed by a turmeric mask to her face and scalp, which helps to decrease inflammation, and does double duty against pimples and razor bumps. Walker\u2019s homemade mask includes turmeric powder, yogurt, rosewater and lemon juice.\n\nOnce out the shower, she applies a toner with salicylic acid, which she says is \u201cvery exciting in a tingling, like, \u2018Oh my God,\u2019 kind of a way\u2014but the tingle at least lets me know that it works!\u201d Afterward, she recommends using a hydrocortisone or steroid cream on the scalp to help nip any inflammation or razor bumps in the bud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker follows this regimen religiously, shaving only every other day to cut down on irritation and get the best results.\n\nBut while Walker absolutely loves her look, she admits that she\u2019s used to getting stares from those who are unaccustomed to seeing a bald woman, which is why it was so refreshing to see the similarly styled Dora Milaje on-screen.\n\n\u201cI went to go see the movie with my son, and we talked a little bit about it after the movie, and he was like, \u2018Well, yeah, it\u2019s like an army of my mom. This is great ... it\u2019s like having my mom, but, like, 10 of them. This is amazing.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those who think a woman going bald compromises her femininity, the doctor has this to say:\n\nFemininity to a lot of people equates with being soft. Femininity to me is the ability to have the option to be soft\u2014the option to be whatever you want\u2014but more importantly, it\u2019s to be a woman and powerful. So I feel very feminine with my head shaved ... I\u2019d feel less feminine if I wore a wig or if my bald head were not on display every day. This is my head. I do what I want to do with it. And if they don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s not really my problem. ... But anybody who doesn\u2019t feel that this look is feminine, I think, needs to really re-evaluate what their insecurities are, and why they would feel the need to place their insecurities on someone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because Walker isn\u2019t the only bald baddie in our midst, we did a little roundup of a few of our other favorite beauties who\u2019ve dared to go bare\u2014or, at least, almost there.\n\nFlorence Kasumba attends the European premiere of Black Panther in London Feb. 8, 2018.

Originally arriving at school with the popular \u201990s-era permed-and-cropped cut made famous by Halle Berry, Walker tells The Glow Up that she quickly found the need for a drastic change:\n\nSo, I got down to New Orleans, and it was like 90-something degrees and 120 percent humidity, and my hair was just\u2014I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t happening. I\u2019m not looking cute right now.\u201d And then, my roommate at the time, when we met, we had the exact same haircut. And I was like, OK; out of necessity and also because I just hate doing what everybody else is doing, I just cut it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat \u201cbig chop\u201d led to what has become Walker\u2019s trademark look for the past 25 years, a gleaming bald head she shaves every other day. A very active mom and wife on top of her duties as a doctor, she credits her choice of hairstyle\u2014or lack thereof\u2014with making her busy lifestyle simpler.\n\nI\u2019m fairly active\u2014I work out a good six, if not seven, days a week. So one of the things I really love about it is the fact that it\u2019s not, there\u2019s not anything that I have to really be concerned about ... but also on top of that, [if I\u2019m] jumping in the pool, or I\u2019m the middle of the street and the wind blows, it feels really just nice. It\u2019s just a really refreshing feeling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker also admits to us that her personal affinity for baldness is as psychological as it is physical:\n\n\n\nI guess, spiritually speaking, I\u2019ve always felt the need [for] my thoughts to be as close to the air as possible; I just need to feel like I have freedom of thought. And for me, that physically just means having the freedom to be able to have my scalp exposed to as many elements possible. But I think more than anything, I like the way it feels, and it just so happens to look good.\n\nBut Walker warns that while lower maintenance, choosing to go bald doesn\u2019t mean no maintenance. She indulges in a strict skin and scalp regimen to keep her look smooth and free of razor bumps, emphasizing that \u201cyou have to give it as much thought as you would give any type of hairstyle.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does she keep her dome glowing? By taking extreme care with the tools and products she uses. \u201cYou can\u2019t just take Barbasol shaving cream or some plastic cheap razor and just go to your head; you\u2019ll destroy your scalp,\u201d she warns. \u201cYou\u2019ll have razor bumps forever, and it\u2019s not going to be cute.\u201d\n\nTo keep her close shave extra-cute, Walker has her routine down to a science:\n\nFirst, using a barber-grade Wahl trimmer, like the GroomsMan T-Pro, specially made to give a bump-free shave, Walker shaves her entire head.\n\n\n\nNext, she goes over her head with a set of clippers\u2014she likes Wahl\u2019s Ultra Close Cut Pro, crafted specifically for close shaves but less likely to cause razor bumps. While, technically, she has a very close shave, Walker says, \u201cTo the naked eye, it looks like my head is shining.\u201d\n\nAfter shaving, Walker oil cleanses her scalp, stressing that she treats her scalp the way she treats her face, first applying an oil cleanser that she wipes off with a hot washcloth, followed by a turmeric mask to her face and scalp, which helps to decrease inflammation, and does double duty against pimples and razor bumps. Walker\u2019s homemade mask includes turmeric powder, yogurt, rosewater and lemon juice.\n\nOnce out the shower, she applies a toner with salicylic acid, which she says is \u201cvery exciting in a tingling, like, \u2018Oh my God,\u2019 kind of a way\u2014but the tingle at least lets me know that it works!\u201d Afterward, she recommends using a hydrocortisone or steroid cream on the scalp to help nip any inflammation or razor bumps in the bud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker follows this regimen religiously, shaving only every other day to cut down on irritation and get the best results.\n\nBut while Walker absolutely loves her look, she admits that she\u2019s used to getting stares from those who are unaccustomed to seeing a bald woman, which is why it was so refreshing to see the similarly styled Dora Milaje on-screen.\n\n\u201cI went to go see the movie with my son, and we talked a little bit about it after the movie, and he was like, \u2018Well, yeah, it\u2019s like an army of my mom. This is great ... it\u2019s like having my mom, but, like, 10 of them. This is amazing.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those who think a woman going bald compromises her femininity, the doctor has this to say:\n\nFemininity to a lot of people equates with being soft. Femininity to me is the ability to have the option to be soft\u2014the option to be whatever you want\u2014but more importantly, it\u2019s to be a woman and powerful. So I feel very feminine with my head shaved ... I\u2019d feel less feminine if I wore a wig or if my bald head were not on display every day. This is my head. I do what I want to do with it. And if they don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s not really my problem. ... But anybody who doesn\u2019t feel that this look is feminine, I think, needs to really re-evaluate what their insecurities are, and why they would feel the need to place their insecurities on someone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because Walker isn\u2019t the only bald baddie in our midst, we did a little roundup of a few of our other favorite beauties who\u2019ve dared to go bare\u2014or, at least, almost there.\n\nFlorence Kasumba attends the European premiere of Black Panther in London Feb. 8, 2018.

But that said, we know it\u2019s not a look every woman can pull off, as Walker aptly notes:\n\nI mean, it\u2019s not for everyone. I do think that everyone should try it, but it\u2019s not necessarily for everyone, because not [everyone\u2019s head] is necessarily evenly shaped. People have asked me \u201cWell, how did you know what your head was going to look like?\u201d I don\u2019t know, I just did it. Just do it. Just try it and see.

Come fall, there\u2019s saturated color, \u201990s-inspired silhouettes and a fair amount of fur to look forward to, so get ready.\n\nBut our favorite trend wasn\u2019t a trend at all; it was texture. Following several seasons in which we\u2019ve seen an uptick in black models wearing their natural tresses on the runways, this season\u2019s presentations boasted a remarkable number of naturally coiffed models on the catwalks. Even labels that typically cater to more conservative consumers, such as Tory Burch and Bottega Veneta, featured not only black models but black models sporting their natural textures in a variety of lengths, shapes and styles.\n\nAnd while it may be tempting to call it a trend, considering the fact that the past year has seen women in the armed forces wholeheartedly embracing the natural-hair movement, more natural-hair moments than ever on the red carpet, and 2018\u2019s biggest film starring a primarily black and entirely naturally styled cast, it\u2019s safe to say that #TeamNatural has gained more than a toehold in popular culture.\n\nAs model Kristina Elise told fashion site PopSugar: \u201cFor me, leaving my hair natural for the runway is really important. It means that the designer is embracing me how I am and not trying to make me like everyone else\u2014because my hair is not like everyone else\u2019s and it\u2019s not going to look the same. I really appreciate it when they make that decision.\u201d\n\nAnd while we know black is always in fashion, it\u2019s nice to see the fashion world actually taking notice.

Marshall (Getty Images)\n\nGrammy-nominated singer, reality-television regular and Braxton-family baby sister Tamar turned heads this week when she took to Instagram to post footage of her having her head shaved with the chorus of Bobby Brown\u2019s \u201cMy Prerogative\u201d playing in the background.\n\nThe diva\u2014as well-known for her array of hairstyles as for her multioctave voice\u2014has notably been estranged from her longtime husband, manager, reality-show co-star and co-parent Vincent Herbert since last year, amid rumors of physical and emotional abuse, accusations that Braxton refuted in December.\n\nWe don\u2019t know if shedding what often looked like a toxic relationship to viewers of WeTV\u2019s Tamar & Vince led Braxton to decide to shed her locks, but it\u2019s a major change to her look, which was heavily associated with wigs and weaves. Apparently, the big chop was done in honor of her 41st birthday, tomorrow on St. Patrick\u2019s Day, which she playfully dubs \u201cSt. Tamar\u2019s Day.\u201d A post-shave Instagram post read:\n\n[I\u2019m] over feeling captive to a wig, weave, people, people\u2019s comments & opinions hell...even my OWN feelings! WE can choose to stop these things from having the power and victory over us!! And for me, that starts TODAY.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut despite Braxton\u2019s declaration of her own liberation from pervasive beauty standards, the internet, of course, had to have its say, weighing in on a topic that, frankly, no one asked its opinion on (and before you @ me with rebuttals about the price of a public image, prove you\u2019ve never posted a selfie).\n\nWhile the response to seeing Braxton\u2019s beautiful face take center stage was overwhelmingly positive, inevitably, there were a few who felt the need to try to be cute\u2014as if Braxton\u2019s bold new look wasn\u2019t cute enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScreenshot: Instagram\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople, please. It is the year 2018, and at this point, no one should have to explain why all of the above is problematic. Yes, we remember Britney Spears\u2019 infamous bald and window-bashing breakdown post-split from ex-husband Kevin Federline (and yes, we also know Spears covered \u201cMy Prerogative\u201d a few years before, but that does not an Easter egg hunt make).\n\nWe also know the bald warrior women of Black Panther\u2019s Dora Milaje are the hottest women to hit the screen so far in 2018. More importantly, we know that folks sound ass-backwards, transphobic and homophobic as hell when they compare a woman who decides to undergo the \u201cbig chop\u201d to a gender nonbinary person. Whatever kind of feelings it triggers in you, you might want to keep them to yourself, because it\u2019s not a good look, and nobody else\u2019s identity is really your business.\n\nAnd guess what? Even if you can\u2019t get over your outdated notions of sexuality and gender (and you really should, for your own sake), we also know plenty of cisgender straight men with long hair (hi, Jason Momoa) and plenty of cis straight women rocking beautiful bald fades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut none of that should really even matter. Like, for real: Grow the hell up.\n\nAs a woman who\u2019s undergone more than one big chop\u2014at times, to release the energy of the past, and sometimes solely for the sake of my hair health\u2014I can vouch that it\u2019s a very liberating experience. I can also attest that it didn\u2019t change the way I express my femininity in the least. In short (pun intended), this kind of sexist idiocy really pisses me off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPersonally, we think this is the prettiest and happiest that Tamar Braxton has looked in years\u2014and we hope she feels as good as she looks. That said, she might have a little work of her own to do, since her 4-year-old son snarkily called her \u201cMr. Mommy\u201d after seeing her new look.\n\n[Sigh.] Doing too much, indeed.

Even as the chronically awkward yet hilarious shopgirl Tracey Gordon, the gorgeous and multitalented Anglo-Ghanaian actress and screenwriter proved herself a skilled shape-shifter, making the character of Tracey as elastic as a rubber band as she tries to find herself in a very repressive and insular world.\n\nBy contrast, Coel\u2019s life and career are expanding by the minute, and it\u2019s a joy to behold. Aside from appearing both in the most recent Star Wars release and in episode 1 of this season of Black Mirror, she\u2019s co-starring in the English musical film Been So Long, due out later this year on Netflix.\n\nSuffice to say, whether choosing a challenging new role or impressing us with her yoga skills on her highly entertaining Instagram page, Michaela Coel likes to push herself to new limits, and her hair is no exception. This chameleon loves to switch up her style, transitioning from her closely cropped natural to any number of wigs at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\nAnd for those who take notice with judgment on the brain, this past weekend, she had this to say while rocking a pink ombre-dyed bobbed wig: \u201cSome of the righteous rally see my shaved head and start talking trash about my wig gang.

So it\u2019s a great responsibility and it\u2019s a great challenge, but it\u2019s my greatest joy in doing it, also.\n\nRepresenting her people was paramount in Friend\u2019s mind as she approached the task of helping to bring Black Panther to life. To begin, she divided the film into three elements: traditional Africa, contemporary Africa and the futuristic Africa represented by the technologically advanced civilization that is Wakanda. In her research, she drew inspiration from everything from traditional African tribes like the Maasai and Zulu to the groundbreaking fashion statements we\u2019ve seen at Afropunk celebrations around the globe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really taking and looking at traditional styles, traditional tribal looks, and seeing what we can make into a modern style,\u201d Friend says. \u201cI like to take, like, a period hairstyle and put it in a modern movie and just put a twist on it. For me, it\u2019s still about classic hairdressing and beautiful lines and silhouettes. That\u2019s how I design hair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriend has certainly had her share of experience with period styles, having also headed the hair departments of Miles Ahead, The Help, Django Unchained, Rock of Ages and Dreamgirls. But whether it\u2019s long and flowing or elaborately braided and twisted, one thing you won\u2019t see in Black Panther is any straightened hair. For Friend, natural hair textures were a major part of her contribution to the visual narrative.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a beautiful time where people are wearing their natural hair,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, there [are] women everywhere who are like, \u2018Throw the pressing comb away, throw the relaxer away. I\u2019m going to wear my natural hair.\u2019 So that whole movement of the empowerment of the hair is there,\u201d Friend explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a diverse universe of naturally styled characters involved a team highly skilled in styling, caring for and mimicking natural hairstyles, as in the case of Angela Bassett\u2019s glorious custom-made wig of 24-inch silvery locs, inspired in equal parts by writer Toni Morrison and director Ryan Coogler\u2019s mother, Joselyn.\n\nBut while Friend isn\u2019t playing favorites on the styles she created, she\u2019s already seeing the influence this film is having on our beauty and fashion choices. She\u2019s received countless raves on the twisted crop Lupita Nyong\u2019o rocks as Dora Milaje operative Nakia and graciously provided The Glow Up with the how-to (hint: The key is keeping it close to the scalp):\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018Wakanda knot\u2019\u2014because it is different than a Bantu knot,\u201d she tells us. \u201c[Because] basically, the hair is rolled down, kind of like a cinnamon roll. And then, once the hair is dried, then, we lifted it from there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEducating other hairstylists is a huge part of Friend\u2019s career, as her greatest hope is to see more hairstylists performing at the top of their game. That\u2019s why she created Hair Scholars, a consortium of award-winning artists led by Friend in educating and preparing aspiring stylists to be the best at their craft and ready to work in the industry.\n\nFriend knows firsthand the value of having a talented team by her side. She credits her Black Panther team for being a large part of the inspiration and craftsmanship that we\u2019ll see on-screen next week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt just felt like our brains\u2014the brainpower was just so high, and the energy was so high, just because we got to create,\u201d she says. \u201cOr somebody\u2019s like, \u2018Well, let\u2019s try this.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Let\u2019s try it!\u2019\n\n\u201cSo it was really great to have that think tank, where we could just be in there and be creating, and just really coming up with things on the fly ... just really having the momentum just to create original pieces that are going to stand the test of time on film,\u201d she continues.\n\nAnd of course, we couldn\u2019t end our conversation without asking Friend how it felt to be on the purple carpet for Black Panther\u2019s epic premiere in Los Angeles last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe premiere was like, you know, it was like 2018 Coming to America\u2014like, it was for real. People took it all the way,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think what it is too, is as black people, we have like\u2014especially now\u2014there\u2019s a sense of pride. People are wearing their hair natural. People are [saying] \u2018black excellence.\u2019 People are rising to the occasion, and I think this movie comes at the time where black people, we want to step forward; we want to be recognized.\n\n\u201cThis movie hits all the right notes for having a black superhero,\u201d she explains. \u201cI mean, at the end of the day, we all want to be superheroes, in whatever we do. If we\u2019re a mom, if we\u2019re a secretary, if we\u2019re a hairdresser\u2014whatever we do, we all want to be a superhero.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re an Los Angeles-based hair artist, you can join Camille Friend for a Hair Scholars master class at the \u201cHair and Makeup by ... \u201d Symposium on March 11 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.", "keywords": ["panthers", "camille", "designer", "natural", "movie", "having", "traditional", "panther", "think", "black", "hair", "meet", "teamsupernatural", "really", "friend", "hero"], "polarity": 0.17398076259489295, "subjectivity": 0.5284920634920632},

Marshall (Getty Images)\n\nGrammy-nominated singer, reality-television regular and Braxton-family baby sister Tamar turned heads this week when she took to Instagram to post footage of her having her head shaved with the chorus of Bobby Brown\u2019s \u201cMy Prerogative\u201d playing in the background.\n\nThe diva\u2014as well-known for her array of hairstyles as for her multioctave voice\u2014has notably been estranged from her longtime husband, manager, reality-show co-star and co-parent Vincent Herbert since last year, amid rumors of physical and emotional abuse, accusations that Braxton refuted in December.\n\nWe don\u2019t know if shedding what often looked like a toxic relationship to viewers of WeTV\u2019s Tamar & Vince led Braxton to decide to shed her locks, but it\u2019s a major change to her look, which was heavily associated with wigs and weaves. Apparently, the big chop was done in honor of her 41st birthday, tomorrow on St. Patrick\u2019s Day, which she playfully dubs \u201cSt. Tamar\u2019s Day.\u201d A post-shave Instagram post read:\n\n[I\u2019m] over feeling captive to a wig, weave, people, people\u2019s comments & opinions hell...even my OWN feelings! WE can choose to stop these things from having the power and victory over us!! And for me, that starts TODAY.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut despite Braxton\u2019s declaration of her own liberation from pervasive beauty standards, the internet, of course, had to have its say, weighing in on a topic that, frankly, no one asked its opinion on (and before you @ me with rebuttals about the price of a public image, prove you\u2019ve never posted a selfie).\n\nWhile the response to seeing Braxton\u2019s beautiful face take center stage was overwhelmingly positive, inevitably, there were a few who felt the need to try to be cute\u2014as if Braxton\u2019s bold new look wasn\u2019t cute enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScreenshot: Instagram\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople, please. It is the year 2018, and at this point, no one should have to explain why all of the above is problematic. Yes, we remember Britney Spears\u2019 infamous bald and window-bashing breakdown post-split from ex-husband Kevin Federline (and yes, we also know Spears covered \u201cMy Prerogative\u201d a few years before, but that does not an Easter egg hunt make).\n\nWe also know the bald warrior women of Black Panther\u2019s Dora Milaje are the hottest women to hit the screen so far in 2018. More importantly, we know that folks sound ass-backwards, transphobic and homophobic as hell when they compare a woman who decides to undergo the \u201cbig chop\u201d to a gender nonbinary person. Whatever kind of feelings it triggers in you, you might want to keep them to yourself, because it\u2019s not a good look, and nobody else\u2019s identity is really your business.\n\nAnd guess what? Even if you can\u2019t get over your outdated notions of sexuality and gender (and you really should, for your own sake), we also know plenty of cisgender straight men with long hair (hi, Jason Momoa) and plenty of cis straight women rocking beautiful bald fades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut none of that should really even matter. Like, for real: Grow the hell up.\n\nAs a woman who\u2019s undergone more than one big chop\u2014at times, to release the energy of the past, and sometimes solely for the sake of my hair health\u2014I can vouch that it\u2019s a very liberating experience. I can also attest that it didn\u2019t change the way I express my femininity in the least. In short (pun intended), this kind of sexist idiocy really pisses me off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPersonally, we think this is the prettiest and happiest that Tamar Braxton has looked in years\u2014and we hope she feels as good as she looks. That said, she might have a little work of her own to do, since her 4-year-old son snarkily called her \u201cMr. Mommy\u201d after seeing her new look.\n\n[Sigh.] Doing too much, indeed.

(Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for Operation Smile) 1 / 21\n\nIf ever the term \u201chair journey\u201d applied, it would be DaCosta\u2019s, albeit an entirely natural one. From a high schooler once given the superlative of \u201cmost hairstyles in one year\u201d to a college co-ed visible across campus rocking a big \u2019fro before natural hair was back in fashion, she\u2019s consistently followed her own instincts when it comes to her crown and is happy to see other women doing the same:\n\nYou know, obviously we have pictures of some of our moms, or aunts or grandmothers in the \u201970s with Afros. But there was a long time when natural hair was not accepted. And so it\u2019s really great for me to see this\u2014I guess it\u2019s being called a \u201cmovement\u201d\u2014women just learning how to care for what comes out of their heads. And it\u2019s nice to have people feel like they have more options, you know? Because we can always do what we want to do, or what we feel comfortable doing\u2014whether it\u2019s a weave or it\u2019s a perm or anything else. But it\u2019s when we don\u2019t feel like we have an option that it becomes a problem; when it then becomes a societal issue, rather than a personal decision. But there\u2019s a cult mentality that\u2019s crept into the movement that I\u2019m not really supportive of. I think it has a lot to do with something that happens when people convert to a lot of things. It\u2019s always the recent converts\u2014whether it be religious dogma or philosophy or anything else\u2014that tend to be really extreme. I live in a little less of an extreme world, in my personal life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, even her decision to crop her famous locks was initially met with more opposition than support. But after years of joking about taking the leap, DaCosta ultimately took the decision in stride: \u201cI was walking down the street, and as crazy as this may sound, I heard a voice\u2014maybe it was my own inner voice or higher self\u2014just say, \u2018Cut your hair.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter considering it late into the night, she lit some candles, sat down in front of her computer and recorded a conversation with herself, contemplating all of the things she would be releasing by cutting her hair:\n\nAnd when I tell you, after childbirth, that was the most powerful experience of my life. I cried, I hugged and kissed myself; it was amazing. And I never looked back. I always thought when people do that, the next day they wake up, like, \u201cOh my God, what did I do? I ruined my life.\u201d I didn\u2019t. I felt good about it. ... There\u2019s so much that has happened since [then] that I know would not have been possible had I been weighed down by the weight that I was carrying; the toxic relationships, other people\u2019s expectations of me, safety, hiding, not feeling beautiful without it. ... One of the things that I cut off as well was fear, and in doing so, realized how guided I was, not by love or confidence, but fear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConfidence is an issue DaCosta confesses to having struggled with in younger years. She recalls an experience early on in her professional acting career, when her father presented her with a unique challenge:\n\nHe goes, \u201cI just have one question: \u2018Where does your confidence come from?\u2019 Don\u2019t answer now\u2014just think about it\u201d ... I think that that was\u2014it was an invitation to step into the answer, to figure out what it was. And it\u2019s something that I guess is from life, when you\u2019re ready to come into yourself. And it can\u2019t be forced and it can\u2019t be faked. And you know, it\u2019s amazing having all these mirrors around me now, and people, and relationships, and just seeing how the types of people coming into my life now are different. And I\u2019m so inspired by them, and they\u2019re a reflection of the work that I\u2019ve been doing to answer that question.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while DaCosta has every intention of growing her hair back\u2014healthier and with new energy and genuine confidence\u2014taking the risk has come back to reward her tenfold, especially as she becomes more aware of the impact her image has had on others:", "keywords": ["images", "talks", "yaya", "natural", "2016", "growth", "dacosta", "chop", "big", "growing", "2015", "know", "hair", "teamnatural", "life", "meds", "chicago", "premiere"], "polarity": 0.1759024490002751, "subjectivity": 0.5000853454114325},

It was a year after she became the breakout star of the breakout hit Braxton Family Values, and a year before the release of her album Love and War.\n\nShe had a peppy smile plastered across her face throughout the segment. And why wouldn\u2019t she? Finally, she was becoming a force of her own creation, someone whose fame origins could be directly attributed to her work, rather than one whose seedbeds stemmed from the contributions of another\u2014in her case, her ultrafamous sister, the legendary Toni Braxton. More important, she was inching closer and closer to her real aim: to successfully relaunch the solo career she\u2019d always wanted.\n\n\n\nIt has proved to be very difficult to launch a black female singer in the last decade. Black radio\u2019s influence has waned. Record labels have shifted interests and have largely sought to repeat formulas they know can score quick cash, at a time when the sudden shift in how we collectively consume music has depleted profit margins. They\u2019re not promoting black female talent the way they used to, and when they do make minimal effort, it is for much younger artists than Braxton, who at the time of the interview was in her mid-30s.\n\nMeanwhile, reality television has proved itself to be a shrewd way to build an artist\u2019s fan base\u2014well, if the music doesn\u2019t suck and there is proper planning in place. Tamar Braxton, along with her husband, Vincent Herbert, skillfully used reality television to make Braxton the star her talent has long demanded that she be.\n\nSo, five years later, as Tamar Braxton releases Bluebird of Happiness, her fifth studio effort (yes, I am counting both her purposely forgotten debut album, Tamar, and her holiday-focused project, Winter Wonderland), it was peculiar to hear her declare to Entertainment Tonight that she will no longer be releasing albums.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things that I want to do, and a lot of things that are in the works,\u201d she explained to ET. It\u2019s a curious statement given that since the premiere of Braxton Family Values, Braxton has been doing a constant juggling act. She has become a daytime talk show host, a contestant on Dancing With the Stars, a touring act.\n\nWhen Braxton announced her decision to leave The Real, it was noted that she would be shifting focus to her solo career. Of course, we soon learned that the \u201cmutual decision\u201d for her to exit the show was anything but. Nonetheless, Braxton always made it appear that music was the top priority, so that if she no longer had daytime TV, she still had a booming music career.\n\nWhat could possibly have changed her mind? \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things that are going on in my relationship and me being close to this music industry, and whatever I can do to eliminate all of the stress and problems off of my relationship, I would rather do that,\u201d Braxton noted to ET. She went on to say, \u201cMy husband and I work very close together and it\u2019s really hard, you know?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for what is apparently her final album, Braxton\u2019s husband \u201ccalls it my best work yet.\u201d\n\nI would say that Braxton\u2019s woefully underappreciated last album, Calling All Lovers, deserves those bragging rights more, but Bluebird of Happiness is yet another fine effort from the youngest Braxton\u2014the one Toni Braxton named as the best singer of the family. Tamar Braxton has always complained about her first album sounding \u201ctoo much like Toni Braxton,\u201d but when you line that album up with the others, they all sound similar. Yes, many of the songs scream \u201curban adult contemporary,\u201d but there\u2019s never been anything wrong with that.\n\nTamar Braxton makes adult records, but she\u2019s never sounded old. Her flair has always been inserted in her music. There\u2019s always been some degree of youthfulness and spunk to much of what she releases. There\u2019s constantly some oomph from her records that comes across as effortless, whereas it sometimes feels out of character coming from her big sister.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s more pronounced in tracks like the Yo Gotti-featuring \u201cHol\u2019 Up,\u201d but it\u2019s also evident in songs like \u201cWanna Love You Boy,\u201d which interpolates Robin Thicke\u2019s \u201cWanna Love You Girl,\u201d and \u201cMy Forever.\u201d It\u2019s also true of \u201cRun Run,\u201d though the trend of American singers faking a Jamaican accent in song should finally be left behind before the year ends. That song would be better without it, which is why I skip it to return to more ear-pleasing works like \u201cPick Me Up,\u201d which features another interpolation, this one of Evelyn Champagne King\u2019s \u201cLove Come Down.\u201d In fact, there is yet another on \u201cThe Makings of You,\u201d which features Gladys Knight.\n\nAlthough I generally worry when contemporary acts rely too heavily on interpolations, given that simply re-creating what listeners have already shown they love sometimes feels lazy, it doesn\u2019t matter to me on Bluebird of Happiness because, simply put, Braxton sounds so good over everything she\u2019s singing. For those who prefer her as a balladeer, the bottom half of the album will prove pleasing.\n\nEven as an independent artist (Braxton recently broke with her label, Epic Records, and her husband has been ordered to pay its parent company, Sony, $3.7 million), Braxton has continued to find success, and Bluebird of Happiness\u2019 lead single, \u201cMy Man,\u201d has performed well on the charts. Moreover, Braxton will be touring on Xscape\u2019s reunion tour alongside Monica. Much of that has to do with the fact that once Braxton finally got another shot at solo stardom, she made the most of it.\n\nSo, again, why is she quitting? Yes, I heard that it\u2019s for the preservation of her marriage, but is there no alternative? Could she simply stop working with her husband in that capacity and they could enjoy each other as just man and wife rather than as business partners? Many people who are deeply in love can\u2019t be co-workers. To walk away from that situation sounds reasonable, but not so much walking away from a career that she has publicly complained about wanting for years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs someone who enjoyed Tamar Braxton in the girl group with her sisters Trina Braxton and Toward Braxton; who actively listens to the 2000 album she loathes and rarely, ever wants to discuss; and who remembers the false starts of a comeback, like when she signed with Tommy Mottola\u2019s Casablanca Records, I\u2019m a bit disappointed that she suddenly wants to abandon it all. Frankly, I don\u2019t get it, but perhaps it\u2019s not for me to get. Ultimately, it\u2019s her decision and, based on her social media commentary, one in which she is steadfast. Such is her right, even as the fans who have been quietly rooting for her for so long\u2014as much as a a decade, in many of our cases\u2014are left stumped by the sudden rush to drop a dream.\n\n\n\nNow, as for whether or not Bluebird of Happiness is the kind of project to end her catalog with, Braxton\u2019s most ardent fans, the Tamartians, will spend the months ahead debating that. I vote no. The album is good, but considering that it is presently being sold as her final project, it disappoints to an extent because after each listen, you\u2019re left with the feeling that she\u2019s got so much music left in her.", "keywords": ["records", "theres", "tamar", "shes", "finally", "long", "album", "music", "bluebird", "braxton", "love", "happiness", "solo", "star", "wanted", "quitting", "husband"], "polarity": 0.18311395018712082, "subjectivity": 0.43005871725383943},

Now my hair is a few inches past my shoulders and longer and thicker than it ever was when it was relaxed.\n\n\n\nI give all the glory in my natural-hair journey to Lenelle Howell, the person who convinced me to go natural, but who is also the person who used to give me relaxers. I know I\u2019m supposed to give all glory to God, but as a black woman (and an agnostic), the closest thing I know to a deity is Lenelle, my hairdresser. She is my alpha and omega. My comforter in times of need. She is my rock in a weary land, and often\u2014when she finishes a new hairdo\u2014I have screamed \u201cHallelujah\u201d and done a Holy Ghost dance.\n\nI met Lenelle in 2010 when I was in an abusive relationship\u2014with my hair. My strands were broken, abused and in desperate need of some tender loving care. While it sometimes takes stylists a few weeks to get the hang of what a client desires, she immediately knew how to transform my sad-ass strands into something happy and manageable.\n\nInitially, I would wash my hair during off-weeks and have her do my touch-ups, occasionally treating myself to a simple wash-and-set (if I was feeling like a rich bitch). Soon it became painfully obvious which weeks she did my hair and which weeks I did, so eventually I decided not to derail her efforts to make my hair healthy and became a pampered weekly client.\n\nI consistently received compliments on my hair, and my Lenelle addiction got so bad that I\u2019d fly to my out-of-town job during the week and fly home simply to have her do work on my locks. She was like my dealer\u2014I\u2019m now convinced that\u2019s why they call it getting one\u2019s hair \u201cfixed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not sure when Lenelle and I crossed over from client and stylist to friends, but we did. She wasn\u2019t just my hair\u2019s caretaker; she provided me with an outlet that facilitated my emotional health on so many days. But shortly after she convinced me to adopt the natural-hair lifestyle (ugh ... I can\u2019t believe I just wrote that), I moved from Orlando, Fla., to Atlanta. Atlanta probably has more natural hairstylists per capita than any other place in the country, but none of them was my hairstylist. It was only after my big move that I realized the space Lenelle occupied in my life, and how much I missed her.\n\nRecently we were on the phone for about a half an hour, but only about five minutes of the conversation centered on my hair. We talked about career, men and life; we caught up like I was sitting in her chair. She said something that really resonated with me: \u201cKyla, people don\u2019t know how sensitive you truly are.\u201d\n\nShe wasn\u2019t talking about my hair.\n\nShe would know. She\u2019s seen me completely break down in her chair when my amour du jour wasn\u2019t acting right. She\u2019s seen me in slumps of feeling unlovable, unappreciated and unsure of my next move in life. She\u2019s been my hairdresser from when I was doing poetry as an out-of-control hobby to when it became my full-time job. She\u2019s been a career counselor, a psychologist and a newfound sister.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor black women, the salon has always been a staple of the community, second only to the black church. Beauty salons and barbershops are the institutional centerpieces of black neighborhoods. They are where people talk politics, get the latest \u201ctea,\u201d network, organize community events and even patronize smaller businesses. If you\u2019re having a party or a protest and you need black people\u2019s help, just go to where they\u2019re getting their hair done.\n\nConsider that Madam C.J. Walker, one of the first black millionaires, was a woman selling hair-care products, and that today, black women spend about nine times as much as their nonblack counterparts on hair-care products, it is safe to say that hair is important to black women. The black hairdresser is the high priestess and No. 1 practitioner of #BlackGirlMagic. She can take the homeliest-looking woman and transform her into a veritable snack. Voil\u00e0\u2014magic!\n\nNot only does a black hairdresser have to be dexterously skilled, but she\u2019s also the gatekeeper to intimate secrets. She is the protector, with \u201cWatch out, I\u2019ve heard about him\u201d certainty. She laughs when it\u2019s time to laugh, and heals when it is time to heal, all while standing on her feet all day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe black salon is a transformation chamber, home to hourly Cinderella stories, where black women can forget the pressures of the world\u2014even if they have to sacrifice hot-ass ears under the dryer.\n\nAfter Lenelle\u2019s intervention, my locks are now out of detox and doing much better. Having natural hair has admittedly saved me a lot of time and money, while making my hair much healthier than when I was addicted to the creamy crack. In the past year, I\u2019ve only gone to the salon twice.\n\nBut I miss my weekly therapy sessions with my counselor. I miss the ritual of sitting on Lenelle\u2019s altar to receive her healing blessings. I miss the safe space of being surrounded by women laughing and sharing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI miss my friend.", "keywords": ["woman", "natural", "shes", "surviving", "ive", "weeks", "going", "know", "hair", "women", "miss", "lenelle", "black", "hairdresser", "missed", "breakup"], "polarity": 0.06577585377585381, "subjectivity": 0.4640754208754209},

Marshall (Getty Images)\n\nGrammy-nominated singer, reality-television regular and Braxton-family baby sister Tamar turned heads this week when she took to Instagram to post footage of her having her head shaved with the chorus of Bobby Brown\u2019s \u201cMy Prerogative\u201d playing in the background.\n\nThe diva\u2014as well-known for her array of hairstyles as for her multioctave voice\u2014has notably been estranged from her longtime husband, manager, reality-show co-star and co-parent Vincent Herbert since last year, amid rumors of physical and emotional abuse, accusations that Braxton refuted in December.\n\nWe don\u2019t know if shedding what often looked like a toxic relationship to viewers of WeTV\u2019s Tamar & Vince led Braxton to decide to shed her locks, but it\u2019s a major change to her look, which was heavily associated with wigs and weaves. Apparently, the big chop was done in honor of her 41st birthday, tomorrow on St. Patrick\u2019s Day, which she playfully dubs \u201cSt. Tamar\u2019s Day.\u201d A post-shave Instagram post read:\n\n[I\u2019m] over feeling captive to a wig, weave, people, people\u2019s comments & opinions hell...even my OWN feelings! WE can choose to stop these things from having the power and victory over us!! And for me, that starts TODAY.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut despite Braxton\u2019s declaration of her own liberation from pervasive beauty standards, the internet, of course, had to have its say, weighing in on a topic that, frankly, no one asked its opinion on (and before you @ me with rebuttals about the price of a public image, prove you\u2019ve never posted a selfie).\n\nWhile the response to seeing Braxton\u2019s beautiful face take center stage was overwhelmingly positive, inevitably, there were a few who felt the need to try to be cute\u2014as if Braxton\u2019s bold new look wasn\u2019t cute enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScreenshot: Instagram\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople, please. It is the year 2018, and at this point, no one should have to explain why all of the above is problematic. Yes, we remember Britney Spears\u2019 infamous bald and window-bashing breakdown post-split from ex-husband Kevin Federline (and yes, we also know Spears covered \u201cMy Prerogative\u201d a few years before, but that does not an Easter egg hunt make).\n\nWe also know the bald warrior women of Black Panther\u2019s Dora Milaje are the hottest women to hit the screen so far in 2018. More importantly, we know that folks sound ass-backwards, transphobic and homophobic as hell when they compare a woman who decides to undergo the \u201cbig chop\u201d to a gender nonbinary person. Whatever kind of feelings it triggers in you, you might want to keep them to yourself, because it\u2019s not a good look, and nobody else\u2019s identity is really your business.\n\nAnd guess what? Even if you can\u2019t get over your outdated notions of sexuality and gender (and you really should, for your own sake), we also know plenty of cisgender straight men with long hair (hi, Jason Momoa) and plenty of cis straight women rocking beautiful bald fades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut none of that should really even matter. Like, for real: Grow the hell up.\n\nAs a woman who\u2019s undergone more than one big chop\u2014at times, to release the energy of the past, and sometimes solely for the sake of my hair health\u2014I can vouch that it\u2019s a very liberating experience. I can also attest that it didn\u2019t change the way I express my femininity in the least. In short (pun intended), this kind of sexist idiocy really pisses me off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPersonally, we think this is the prettiest and happiest that Tamar Braxton has looked in years\u2014and we hope she feels as good as she looks. That said, she might have a little work of her own to do, since her 4-year-old son snarkily called her \u201cMr. Mommy\u201d after seeing her new look.\n\n[Sigh.] Doing too much, indeed.

So in the interest of time, I\u2019ll only cover where my prerogative leads me. Feel free to cue up select tracks from the catalog of the legendary Kang of R&B, Bobby Brown, while reading this.\n\n\n\nOverall, I would say that once again, the BET Awards proved itself to be the most vital and entertaining awards show on television. I get that it\u2019s a thing for some to pile on BET, but, beloveds, y\u2019all will never be this gassed about the MTV Video Music Awards, the Billboard Awards, the Oscars or any other awards show. Some of us will repeat that sentiment every year until y\u2019all shut the hell up.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow that I\u2019ve gotten the positive affirmation out of the way, let\u2019s discuss some of the missteps in terms of production. Clearly, this was the first show without Stephen Hill at the helm. The show lasted 30 minutes longer than scheduled. I love my people and I love my people\u2019s awards show, but four hours is a long time\u2014especially when your preshow is two hours.\n\nMeanwhile, this show has suffered from technical difficulties from time to time in the past, but c\u2019mon, nah, you can\u2019t cue up a performance and then say, \u201cWait-wait-wait, let\u2019s have a do-over.\u201d Shoutout to SZA, though, for handling that with grace. Still, there seemed to be some occasional sound issues, and the cues were off. Also, who thought that conveyor belt or whatever you call that moving contraption was a good idea? So glad no Negro fell and proceeded to curse out Debra Lee and Co. before presenting a humanitarian award.\n\n\n\nAs for the host, Leslie Jones, my lord, is she blessed with the gift of volume. Very few people can make Mo\u2019Nique seem \u201clow energy\u201d by comparison, but that Leslie Jones\u2014whew, she could wake up half the world if she ever decided to sing \u201cOne Sweet Day\u201d in the shower.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nLike, I can hear her even here.\n\n\n\nIn any event, I was reminded that while I hated the time racist trolls picked on the Saturday Night Live cast member, her actual humor can be an acquired taste. She had some funny moments, but there was something amiss with her monologue and a few of those sketches. You could tell the crowd felt similarly at times, \u2019cause Jones got plenty o\u2019 church claps as she cracked jokes. But she looked nice in red, and she seemed extremely happy to be hosting. I\u2019m going to leave it on that note and wish her well should she get booked again.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, the performances.\n\n\n\nBruno Mars: As a performer, Puerto Rican Frankie Lymon is near perfection and in a league of his own. Funny enough, he had an entire arena of black folks cheering him on while a few on Twitter debated earlier whether or not he was guilty of \u201ccultural appropriation.\u201d Much like y\u2019all\u2019s president, Minute Maid Mao, folks learn terms and don\u2019t really know what they mean, yet use them anyway. The man\u2019s music may be derivative, but he respects black music and black culture and vocalizes that respect often, and obviously we know that otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have opened the BET Awards.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, as far as that lil\u2019 clip of him dozing off while Mary J. Blige performed, I don\u2019t think he was bored at all. No, no, he was just coming down. Off what? I doubt I\u2019m allowed to say anything else, so let\u2019s move along.\n\nMary J. Blige: I love her for beginning her set with that song that basically is one big fuck-you to her soon-to-be ex-husband, Kendu Isaacs.

After clicking on about the 12th video geared toward women and our natural-hair needs, our guy friend blurted out, \u201cWhat about MY hair\u2019s protein?!\u201d\n\n\n\nYou see, he\u2019s recently become interested in keeping his 4c coils healthy, and tossed around the idea of growing it out longer than his current cropped style. After rolling our eyes at his whining, we started to think about the growing number of men who care about their hair health, and how it may be difficult to find a similar community and shared knowledge geared toward their needs.\n\nBig names in natural-hair products, like Shea Moisture, Form (from the minds behind Bevel) and Oyin, have all extended their product lines to cater to the needs of men. The natural-hair movement seems to be recognizing that there is room for the fellas, too, and the DIY culture of social media is following suit. The men are getting involved in tutorials and spreading the empowerment message that healthy, long natural hair isn\u2019t just for the ladies\u2014though we ladies could learn a few things from them, too.\n\n\n\nWith their entrance into the female-dominated beauty world, these perfectly coiffed hair \u201cguy-rus\u201d are redefining masculinity for men of color and providing much-needed tips for their female viewers as well. Hair length, hair health and hope for the perfect twist-out are not confined to any gender norms or expectations; and these men are taking on the system, one subscriber at a time.\n\n\u201cLength goals\u201d doesn\u2019t seem strong enough for how we feel looking at this unreal mane. Ferrer is a Virginia native with dreams of making it big in the modeling industry. His 3a-3b hair has gained him both a hefty social media following and access to some of our female follicle faves, like Nia Light and Bianca Renee Today, sharing hairstyle tutorials or just snapping a perfect photo for the \u2019gram.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this curly boy is more than just a pretty face; he shares with his followers some of the bullying he endured as a child with long, curly hair\u2014being teased and told he looked like a girl. One of Ferrer\u2019s followers posted a picture of her young son, explaining that he was being teased for his long hair and had been asking to cut it until seeing Ferrer\u2019s page and videos. The golden-hearted guru confirmed that was exactly the reason he started his social media pages: to inspire other young boys to love themselves and ignore the negativity.\n\nWinstonee brings healthy hair habits and style techniques to the gentleman who isn\u2019t looking to grow his strands to the ground. His channel is packed with videos addressing everything from the benefits of apple-cider vinegar to issues with hair growth\u2014and giveaways! He brings a very down-to-earth, approachable style to his tutorials, all while convincing you that he knows his way around a wash-and-go.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSprinkling in some fashion and lifestyle content, Winstonee is on his grind, posting new videos twice a week. This is the perfect guru for men looking to maintain healthy hair and try out new products or styles, all while keeping their coils cropped\u2014and for the ladies who love them.\n\nWith a full crown of curls and on-trend undercuts, Williams is another newbie to the beauty vlog world, posting his first hair video just 10 months ago. But Williams is refreshingly himself on his growing social media platforms. Tackling flat twists, product reviews and hair breakage, this guru-in-training has already offered good insight to men looking to grow and maintain healthy natural hair. We\u2019re definitely keeping our eye on this one, since only a few months in, he is already gaining popularity and showcasing the changing norms of an evolving culture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom product suggestions to tips on recovering your strands from heat damage, Pearson is all about promoting a healthy hair journey. This rising beauty-vlog star has been growing his fan base since 2011 and was recently featured as a guru fave by Allure magazine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPearson has shared his transition journey from relaxed to natural hair with his followers, using chemicals to straighten his hair for cornrows and braided styles and regretting the damage it did to his hair. He wants to remove the gender headers from beauty and promote the message that black hair is good hair, however we choose to wear it. \u201cHair does not have a gender, and neither should the products,\u201d Pearson commented. \u201cI let my hair speak for itself. When most people watch my videos, they don\u2019t really concern themselves with my gender. What they see first is my mane of healthy hair\u2014healthy black hair, at that!\u201d\n\nThis multiracial (Puerto Rican, African American and white) bilingual beauty (his videos appear in both English and German) is sharing all of his coil tips with his growing subscribers straight from Germany.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an interview with Naturally Curly, Graham shared great advice for men pursuing their journey to healthy natural hair. \u201cHair is not just a girly thing. Men can also have long curly hair. Don\u2019t be ashamed to buy a deep conditioner and a satin scarf, and if someone asks what you want with that ... tell them you are on a healthy hair journey.\u201d This talented content creator recently made the leap to entrepreneur with the release of his own hair-extension line, promoting from his Instagram page. Graham pineapples; he reviews products; he rocks protective styles. We\u2019re in!\n\nOriginally starting his channel to document his locs journey, Barnes is very new to the vlogging world, posting his first video only 10 months ago. An Atlanta-based fitness enthusiast, Barnes is honest about his struggle to live for himself and go after his purpose regardless of any public opinion. With videos on twist-out and stretching techniques posted already, this gentleman is off to a great start in helping men with their questions about grooming and hair care.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a recent video, Barnes leaves his followers with an ever important reminder about loving and living for yourself: \u201cIf we\u2019re always wondering and worried about what other people may think about us, we will never move forward in life and progress.\u201d We hope to see more of this positive personality as he becomes more comfortable sharing his journey.\n\nWhat I love the most about Humphrey\u2019s page is that he takes men\u2019s hair way past the wash-and-go styles we\u2019ve come to expect\u2014trying box braids, Bantu knots and beaded cornrows. With a hilarious personality and \u201cinstant bestie\u201d vibe, Will brings his followers hairstyle tutorials, product suggestions and routine rundowns. He\u2019s also included content around travel, beauty routines and what he calls \u201cshenanigans,\u201d dropping a little something for everyone on his channel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the midst of all the loose-textured, \u201ccurls with just water\u201d vloggers, it\u2019s a breath of fresh air to see tutorials and product reviews targeting kinky coil textures. The best advice we got from Humphrey\u2019s page? \u201cDead ends are like fake friends ... cut them off.\u201d Life and hair goals unite!\n\nBefore we even got to McDonald\u2019s hair tutorials, we wanted to know every single tip this man has about brows. Thankfully, he heard our cry and gave a detailed walkthrough of his shape, cut and clean routine for his full brows as the very first video posted to his channel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, McDonald has brought followers along for the ride as he started college, got played by Tinder dates and shared his roommate horror stories. After two years of his life and hair updates (including video cameos with his siblings), we feel as if we\u2019re officially part of the McDonald family. To call this rising star a natural-hair guru seems a bit limiting, since his channel definitely tackles more than just hair tutorials. But we\u2019re glad to see another young voice setting his own standards for beauty and style for men.\n\nCamera-shy, Sheldon is not. Just a short scroll down his feed shows that this fella knows his way around a beauty shot and isn\u2019t new to the \u201cflip and smize\u201d game. This strand star recognizes the dedication (and arm strength) it takes to maintain healthy hair and take on the task of twist-outs and curl techniques.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also brings a great young perspective to the natural-hair community, using new-gen rappers like Lil Yachty and Travis Scott for hairstyle inspo. In a recent video on his page, while blowing out his hair for box braids, Sheldon joked, \u201cY\u2019all ask me about my workout routine\u2014this is it.\u201d\n\nWe feel you, Sheldon; wash day and arm day go hand-in-hand around here.", "keywords": ["tutorials", "things", "teach", "naturalhair", "followers", "ready", "guyrus", "teamnatural", "hair", "video", "men", "beauty", "videos", "product", "coed", "healthy"], "polarity": 0.21418345543345543, "subjectivity": 0.48765262515262503},

True enough, the show started to sag a bit in 2014, but just a month later, it was being celebrated for besting the likes of Meredith Vieira's now canceled show in ratings.\n\nHowever, there is a more recent story about how the show is once again suffering from a ratings drop that has it matching its series low. It remains to be seen whether the show will bounce back as it has in the past\u2014although, if you\u2019ve followed the new season thus far, it might not be surprising to see this show remain in struggle mode.\n\nWhile the remaining four co-hosts\u2014Tamera Mowry-Housley, Jeannie Mai, Adrienne Bailon and Loni Love\u2014are all lovely people, there is something noticeably missing from the show. That something is the former co-host who sat farther to the left and who continues to be what I feel is the real-life version of that old BET-made animation known as Cita.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhatever one makes of the youngest Braxton sister, she\u2019s certainly never been dull. Now more than ever, I miss her interjecting her opinion whenever the mood suited her. The same goes for her beginning statements with, \u201cI mean \u2026 \u201d and \u201cWelll \u2026 \u201d and \u201cTuh, girl \u2026 \u201d Ditto for her rolling her eyes and sucking her teeth.\n\nWait. I cannot forget my favorite: the very high-pitched, \u201cYou tried it!\u201d\n\nThing is, if you\u2019re going to copy The View, which birthed the basis of this show, as well as The Talk and others, you\u2019ve got to be committed. What both The View and even The Talk understood is that when you create a winning formula, you have to commit to it. For The Real, it\u2019s five different types of women on one panel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMowry-Housley is the nice, polite Christian woman who married that nice man from Fox News. Mai is that spunky person with the mom who could easily do her job and everyone else\u2019s, TBH. Bailon is loud, no longer a Cheetah Girl from 3LW, and does a great job emulating Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cCrazy In Love\u201d strut at the beginning of the show. Love is loud, cracks jokes and will, I guess, fuss at you when necessary to spread viral content online.\n\nWell, they\u2019re all loud\u2014except for Mowry-Housley\u2014but with Braxton\u2019s absence, now more than ever, we can tell that not all loud people are created equal. Who remembers when 702 sisters Irish and Orish Grinstead tried to continue on with the group without Meelah, replacing her with a singer named Cree Le\u2019More? They recorded the lead single \u201cPootie Tangin\u2019\u201d for the Chris Rock film Pootie Tang, which flopped, and then Meelah ultimately came back.\n\nThe Real without Tamar Braxton is basically the song \u201cPootie Tangin\u2019.\u201d\n\nBraxton will not be coming back to the old group, though. She\u2019s already working with Steve Harvey on a new daytime talk show called The Tamar Braxton Show. One wonders how Braxton will carry a talk show all her own, but for the people producing The Real, it\u2019s time to stop playing and find a replacement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo one will be another Tamar Braxton, but the right person can bring her own unique energy to the group and give the show the jolt it needs to move forward before it\u2019s too late. There is room for error, of course. Farrah Franklin didn\u2019t help fans get over LeToya Luckett, or LaTavia Roberson, but we did have many great moments with Michelle Williams and the group as DC3.\n\nWhen you watch The Real now, it\u2019s like Diana Ross left the Supremes and the remaining four can\u2019t even give the viewers \u201cUp the Ladder to the Roof.\u201d Hurry, y\u2019all, \u2019cause in the land of daytime TV, y\u2019all will get y\u2019all\u2019s real asses canceled fast.

Whennah Andrews of the U.S. Army National Guard tries to hide her braces while showing off her smile. But four years since first advocating against grooming regulations that barred soldiers from wearing natural hairstyles, her smile hints at relief over one of the final steps in the fight for acceptance.\n\nA decade-old ban on dreadlocks is finally coming to an end.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter all my years of service, I felt like I had a target on my back. I walked a very tight line, but my convictions were more important to me than a paycheck.\u201d \u2014Staff Sgt. Chaunsey Logan\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn Army directive, issued in February, adjusted its grooming policies related to allow dreadlocks\u2014which had been banned since 2005.\n\nThe policy that banned all natural hairstyles, called AR 670-1, first leaked online in 2014. It outlawed twists, braids, cornrows and Afros\u2014styles commonly associated with black women. Andrews first sent them to me before the revisions went public, and after our story sparked months of outrage\u2014including an open letter from the Congressional Black Caucus (pdf) and a review ordered by the Pentagon\u2014the Army reversed course.\n\nIt marked a significant victory for many black female soldiers. But Andrews wasn\u2019t one of them. Despite the Army\u2019s reversal, the ban on dreadlocks remained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was a setback,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was attention paid to other styles like cornrows and twists, but a lot of people ignored dreadlocks because the mindset was, \u2018Well, they\u2019ve been banned already anyway.\u2019\u201d\n\nBefore, the Army\u2019s vague definition of dreadlocks\u2014including controversial terms like \u201cunkempt\u201d and \u201cmatted\u201d\u2014allowed women with neatly groomed locs to bypass the regulation.\n\n\n\n\u201cLocs being unclean and unkempt is a stereotype that impacts the men and women who wear them,\u201d says popular beauty vlogger Nikky Nwamokobia. In a YouTube video, Andrews and Nwamokobia dispel common myths associated with dreadlocks\u2019 cleanliness and ease of use in the military.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was important for the Army to see that, for many women, locs are their only option to maintain hair without using harsh chemical relaxers, weaves or wigs,\u201d Nwamokobia says.\n\nHundreds of soldiers were faced with a dilemma: Cut their hair, be reprimanded or unenlist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStaff Sgt. Chaunsey Logan of Fort Stewart, Ga., was also one of those soldiers. The 16-year soldier never had any issue since first locking her hair in 2011. But the natural-hair ban meant added scrutiny. After refusing to cut her locs, she faced a dishonorable discharge that would have affected her eligibility for work and education benefits under the GI Bill.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter all my years of service, I felt like I had a target on my back,\u201d she says. \u201cI walked a very tight line, but my convictions were more important to me than a paycheck.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was prepared for the worst, but a chance decision to style her locs in a bun during her appeal allowed her to exploit a loophole in the policy. Her hair now looked like Senegalese twists, which are authorized under AR 670-1. An examination of her hair right there in the hearing room determined that Logan was in compliance with the guidelines.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt shows you just how fickle the regulation was,\u201d she says. \u201cTo them, it was just hair, but for me it represented who I am as a black woman.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut even as the military, one of the most conservative institutions in the country, develops more progressive stances on hair, a return to civilian life may invite the same stigmas that dreadlocked servicewomen face while enlisted.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, employees face an uphill battle claiming race-based employment discrimination over their dreadlocks. Even though Title VII of the Civil Rights Act protects against workforce discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex and national origin, hairstyles aren\u2019t included.\n\n\u201cIf the person is Rastafarian, they have much firmer ground for claiming discrimination because it\u2019s generally accepted that they are a part of the religion,\u201d says attorney Arthur R. Ehrlich of the Chicago-based Goldman & Ehrlich law firm, which specializes in employment law and discrimination. Proving race-based discrimination, he says, is trickier because \u201chairstyles are not considered as characteristics associated with race.\u201d\n\nIn late 2016, a federal judge ruled that employees and applicants don\u2019t have a right to wear dreadlocks after a young woman sued Alabama-based Catastrophe Management Solutions for racial discrimination. The insurance company rescinded her job offer after she declined to cut her locs. The EEOC, which represented the applicant, argued \u201cdreadlocks are a manner of wearing the hair that is physiologically and culturally associated with people of African descent.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a 3-0 decision, however, the court disagreed.\n\n\u201cThe fact that I can serve my country with my hair the way God intended it but be denied a job when I return shows just how much work there is left to do.\u201d \u2014Staff Sgt. Chaunsey Logan\n\n\u201cIn the military and civilian world, the ones making these decisions are those who will never have the hair texture or cultural background to understand,\u201d says retired Sgt. Major Donnell Johns. Johns fielded the concerns of many servicewomen, including Andrews, about how to navigate the dreadlocks ban.\u201cThey don\u2019t understand that dreadlocks, like many other black hairstyles, are deeply ingrained in cultural and ethnic identity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter fighting to keep her dreadlocks, Logan, who has served tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, says that she refuses to take up the battle again in the corporate world. \u201cI rather go back to war than go through that process again,\u201d she says. \u201cThe fact that I can serve my country with my hair the way God intended it but be denied a job when I return shows just how much work there is left to do.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor now, the battle over dreadlocks in the Army may be won, but the war is far from over. Andrews and Nwamokobia have paired up again to take on the only military branch where a dreadlocks ban remains: the Navy. After initial talks, they plan to tackle the Navy\u2019s ban the same way they did the Army: through education. The goal is to enlighten Navy personnel and the public about their ease of use and necessity for black women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe are currently working on a video for the Navy\u2019s ban on locs,\u201d says Nwamokobia. \u201cWith the military as the role model, we plan on continuing on to corporate America in hopes to continue the momentum of positive and inclusive change.\u201d\n\nDespite a more progressive military, Andrews\u2019 reserved smile fades amid her concern over the hundreds of dreadlocked soldiers who will eventually return to civilian life. But she\u2019s \u201cprepared to fight against stereotypes with the same vigor for women outside the military as those within.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven if, for her, it was too late.\n\n\n\nAndrews, like many other servicewomen, cut her locs prior to the Army\u2019s reversal. While she\u2019s already growing them back, dreadlocks won\u2019t be formally accepted until next year.", "keywords": ["ban", "discrimination", "locs", "dreadlocked", "acceptance", "civilian", "army", "battle", "hair", "dreadlocks", "women", "black", "servicewomen", "military", "andrews", "fight"], "polarity": 0.06786226930963773, "subjectivity": 0.37948849396217815},

Now one of the biggest breaks in her post-Braxton Family Values career\u2014a slot on the hit daytime talk show The Real\u2014has come to an abrupt end. While the official announcement claimsthat it was a mutual decision, the first outlet to report the news notes that Braxton was fired\u2014something Braxton\u2019s own fiery Instagram post suggests, since it claims \u201cbackstabbing.\u201d Braxton didn\u2019t name names, but she did unfollow everyone on the show except for her now-former-co-host-closest-to-the-ideals-of-Jesus, Tamera Mowry-Housley.\n\nQuoting what it describes as a \u201cvery reliable source\u201d (Wendy Williams suggested that it was Loni Love on Monday\u2019s edition of The Wendy Williams Show), Love B. Scott reported: \u201cTamar Braxton just got fired from The Real. She wasn\u2019t reading too well with the audience and sales people didn\u2019t find her to be a good fit with advertisers. Also, production found her too difficult to deal with.\u201d\n\nOf course, when one reads phrasing like \u201cdidn\u2019t find her to be a good fit with advertisers,\u201d certain sensitivities are triggered. One of those includes the notion that maybe, just maybe, Tamar was too loud, and her rolling neck too active, to shill, oh, I don\u2019t know, diet products, kale chips, Cheetos or whatever else daytime TV typically advertises. My people, my people. I feel you, but not in this instance.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear about The Real: Everyone on this show is loud minus Tamera, so while Tamar may be the real-life version of BET\u2019s old cartoon character Cita, Loni Love has a volume set just as high (Jesus\u2019 alarm clock).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a longtime fan of Tamar Braxton\u2019s (I listen regularly to the first album she pretends never happened), I think this is a teachable moment because I can totally see why Tamar might have gotten the boot. For one, she wasn\u2019t always the most pleasant person on the panel. Her eyes rolled as hard as my body does after my sixth tequila drink (save the judgment) and the DJ turns on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cSorry.\u201d She tended to talk over her fellow panelists. She could be dismissive here and there of their feelings, too.\n\nIn sum, she treated her co-workers the way Towanda Braxton claims she treats her sisters. The problem, though, is that there is no Mama Braxton to come and save her from their criticism. Moreover, these are co-workers, not kinfolk. Production doesn\u2019t have to put up with you, especially once they realize that they don\u2019t need you to survive. So as special as Tamar Braxton is and as magnetic a personality many find her, we\u2019re all dispensable.\n\nShoutout to Star Jones and Rosie Perez.\n\nI\u2019m not Iyanla Vanzant, but I have a few suggestions for the littlest Braxton.\n\nFor one, stop taking to social media to discuss your messy work breakups. I can only imagine the betrayal and subsequent rage Tamar must be feeling, but if you\u2019re being accused of being a diva or combative, reading the girls on Instagram does little to negate that argument.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, while losing a gig certainly sucks, it does create an opportunity for Tamar Braxton, singer, to return to top priority. Tamar\u2019s second album was so well-done, but between TV shows one, two and three, it seemed to have gotten lost in the shuffle. Tamar\u2019s voice is a gift, and I want more people to realize how good it is.\n\nThat would lead to more touring, more albums and just more from Tamar the artiste.\n\nCan she keep doing reality TV? Sure, get your money and use it to sell your music. But whew, if you can\u2019t get your morning face together for a daytime talk show, don\u2019t sign that contract.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI would add more suggestions, but the reality is, talking too much and doing the most appear to be her biggest issues. Good luck, girl. I\u2019m rooting for you even if Loni, Adrienne, Jeannie and your producers can\u2019t be bothered.\n\nMichael Arceneaux hails from Houston, lives in Harlem and praises Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s name wherever he goes.

Marshall (Getty Images)\n\nGrammy-nominated singer, reality-television regular and Braxton-family baby sister Tamar turned heads this week when she took to Instagram to post footage of her having her head shaved with the chorus of Bobby Brown\u2019s \u201cMy Prerogative\u201d playing in the background.\n\nThe diva\u2014as well-known for her array of hairstyles as for her multioctave voice\u2014has notably been estranged from her longtime husband, manager, reality-show co-star and co-parent Vincent Herbert since last year, amid rumors of physical and emotional abuse, accusations that Braxton refuted in December.\n\nWe don\u2019t know if shedding what often looked like a toxic relationship to viewers of WeTV\u2019s Tamar & Vince led Braxton to decide to shed her locks, but it\u2019s a major change to her look, which was heavily associated with wigs and weaves. Apparently, the big chop was done in honor of her 41st birthday, tomorrow on St. Patrick\u2019s Day, which she playfully dubs \u201cSt. Tamar\u2019s Day.\u201d A post-shave Instagram post read:\n\n[I\u2019m] over feeling captive to a wig, weave, people, people\u2019s comments & opinions hell...even my OWN feelings! WE can choose to stop these things from having the power and victory over us!! And for me, that starts TODAY.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut despite Braxton\u2019s declaration of her own liberation from pervasive beauty standards, the internet, of course, had to have its say, weighing in on a topic that, frankly, no one asked its opinion on (and before you @ me with rebuttals about the price of a public image, prove you\u2019ve never posted a selfie).\n\nWhile the response to seeing Braxton\u2019s beautiful face take center stage was overwhelmingly positive, inevitably, there were a few who felt the need to try to be cute\u2014as if Braxton\u2019s bold new look wasn\u2019t cute enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScreenshot: Instagram\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople, please. It is the year 2018, and at this point, no one should have to explain why all of the above is problematic. Yes, we remember Britney Spears\u2019 infamous bald and window-bashing breakdown post-split from ex-husband Kevin Federline (and yes, we also know Spears covered \u201cMy Prerogative\u201d a few years before, but that does not an Easter egg hunt make).\n\nWe also know the bald warrior women of Black Panther\u2019s Dora Milaje are the hottest women to hit the screen so far in 2018. More importantly, we know that folks sound ass-backwards, transphobic and homophobic as hell when they compare a woman who decides to undergo the \u201cbig chop\u201d to a gender nonbinary person. Whatever kind of feelings it triggers in you, you might want to keep them to yourself, because it\u2019s not a good look, and nobody else\u2019s identity is really your business.\n\nAnd guess what? Even if you can\u2019t get over your outdated notions of sexuality and gender (and you really should, for your own sake), we also know plenty of cisgender straight men with long hair (hi, Jason Momoa) and plenty of cis straight women rocking beautiful bald fades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut none of that should really even matter. Like, for real: Grow the hell up.\n\nAs a woman who\u2019s undergone more than one big chop\u2014at times, to release the energy of the past, and sometimes solely for the sake of my hair health\u2014I can vouch that it\u2019s a very liberating experience. I can also attest that it didn\u2019t change the way I express my femininity in the least. In short (pun intended), this kind of sexist idiocy really pisses me off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPersonally, we think this is the prettiest and happiest that Tamar Braxton has looked in years\u2014and we hope she feels as good as she looks. That said, she might have a little work of her own to do, since her 4-year-old son snarkily called her \u201cMr. Mommy\u201d after seeing her new look.\n\n[Sigh.] Doing too much, indeed.

In July 2016, a news story went viral about a school in Pretoria, South Africa, banning black girls from wearing natural hairstyles like Afros because they were \u201cuntidy\u201d and \u201cunladylike.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn March 2017, twins Grace and Thabisa, who are of South Sudanese descent, were pulled out of their classes at Bentleigh Seconday School in Melbourne, Australia, and told to remove their braids because it didn\u2019t \u201crepresent the school.\u201d After an uproar from parents who said the policy was an attack on African culture, the girls were allowed to return to school.\n\nLast week, there was a story about twins Maya and Deanna Cook, students at Mystic Valley Regional Charter School in Malden, Mass., who were kicked off their sports teams and prohibited from attending a prom because they wore their hair in braids.\n\nThe school said that the girls were in violation of the dress code for wearing their hair in an \u201cunnatural\u201d way, which includes braids. The girls were also placed in detention for two weeks for refusing to change their hair, and other black students were singled out for hair inspections.\n\nNews outlets reported this week that at Montverde Academy in Lake County, Fla., school administrators asked Nicole Orr, a 16-year-old black student, to change her natural hair because it was against the dress code. In both cases, school administrators contacted the parents first to ask them to \u201ccorrect\u201d the teens\u2019 hair. In Nicole\u2019s case, administrators cited the need for \u201cneat\u201d and \u201cclean\u201d hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat black people in general and black girls specifically are being targeted by these discriminatory practices because of \u201cneatness\u201d and \u201ccleanliness\u201d is laughable. It is common knowledge that hair lice is a major problem with white schoolchildren, particularly in elementary schools. Thousands of letters go out to parents each year regarding lice outbreaks, and some parents complain that children with lice are sometimes allowed to stay in school, as was the case in Arlington, Va., in 2014.\n\nMany environmentalists, some of whom are students, believe that taking fewer showers saves water, which is true. This practice, however, also means that people are often subjected to foul bodily odors as well as dirty hair, which can be oily, greasy and downright smelly.\n\nAs a college professor, I encounter all kinds of folks. It has never occurred to me to file lawsuits against my students or colleagues, or to lobby for policies to put an end to this practice. If they\u2019re cool with having hair that sometimes smells like a combination of garlic bologna, dogs caught in rainstorms and formaldehyde, then so be it. In my head, I call it \u201ceau de funk for our future,\u201d and simply suck it up. So why are black people in general and black girls specifically being targeted?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Petty Pendergrass in me thinks that some folks are jealous because they don\u2019t have the versatility that natural hair affords black women. We can loc, twist, cut, grow, curl, weave, braid, shave\u2014pretty much do anything we want with it and look good doing it. If natural hairstyles worn by black girls are so bad, then why are white celebrities like Fergie, David Beckham, Juliette Lewis and the Kardashians celebrated for wearing them?\n\nThe academic in me knows that there\u2019s something more occurring: the targeting of black girls for whatever infraction\u2014perceived or real\u2014of normative worldwide behavior. Historically, the bodies of young black girls have been policed, touched, harassed and violated\u2014legally. See slavery. See segregation. See the civil rights era. See the post-civil-rights era. See the new millennium. See Halle Berry\u2019s unwanted kiss from Adrien Brody at the 2003 Academy Awards. See the kidnapped girls of Chibok, Nigeria. If you think that a focus on people touching black women inappropriately, especially when it comes to our hair, is a stretch, then listen to Solange\u2019s song \u201cDon\u2019t Touch My Hair\u201d for a recent testimony.\n\nWhat is happening to our girls now is not a stretch. In fact, it is part of the fabric of our country and its institutions. In September 2016, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in a lawsuit filed against Catastrophe Management Solutions, effectively ruling that refusing to hire someone because he or she wears dreadlocks is legal. Out of all the hairstyles people wear in this country, dreadlocks\u2014a natural hairstyle that is sometimes worn for religious purposes, sometimes for fashion or for personal expression\u2014were singled out.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiscriminating against people with \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201cblack\u201d hair cuts across many categories, including race, class, gender and nationality. Singling out and discriminating against black women for natural hairstyles like locs and twists is quite common, in fact. In 2014, Ayana Byrd and Lori L. Tharp wrote an article for the New York Times entitled, \u201cWhen Black Hair Is Against the Rules,\u201d detailing the long history of discrimination by U.S. institutions against black hairstyles. The article came out just as the U.S. Army\u2019s grooming policies, some of which specifically targeted black women\u2019s natural hairstyles, including dreadlocks, were being revised by then-Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel after the Congressional Black Caucus, led by Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio), requested the revision.\n\nReportedly, there was a lot of confusion about the rules because many officers had trouble differentiating among locs, twists and cornrows. Despite the federal circuit court\u2019s ruling in 2016 allowing discrimination in hiring against blacks with dreadlocks, the U.S. Army lifted the ban on locs, ending years of \u201cscrutiny and confusing enforcement of rules about their appearance,\u201d in February 2017.\n\nEven though the Army could have continued to legally enforce the policy as a requirement for employment, it chose to do the opposite. Why? Because singling out one group of people for something like hair is demoralizing, abusive and unnecessary. How do you ask people to die for their country but then give them grief over the actual hair growing out of their scalps? The answer is, you don\u2019t, because, wait for it: It\u2019s the right thing to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is happening to these young black girls in schools is what happens when a federal circuit court makes it OK to discriminate against black people with natural hair in the workplace. Those in positions of authority at these schools think it is their right to swap one environment for another and pick on black girls because of their \u201cunnatural\u201d natural hair.\n\nThe only thing \u201cunnatural\u201d about the situation is that so-called educators would try to enlist Nicole Orr\u2019s parents in an attempt to socially isolate her; assault her psyche, self-identity and self-esteem; and demand that she change her beautiful head of hair. What\u2019s natural about that?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing a parent is hard in general, but being the parent of a black child is exhausting. Why? Because we always have to worry about someone messing with our children for no reason other than that they\u2019re black. We are always managing the expectations of others, including how our children should look in order to be palatable to them. Unfortunately, black parents also have to worry about our children being harassed, bullied or publicly humiliated by adults\u2014grown people with academic degrees and all sorts of training, who should know better and do better.\n\nAs an educator and the mother of a black girl whose hair is natural and will remain so until she is old enough to decide otherwise, I would ask these adults to please take their hands and policies out of our daughters\u2019 hair. In the words of India.Arie, black girls are not their skin, hair or your expectations. They are girls\u2014human beings\u2014who deserve to be educated without being degraded, publicly ridiculed or humiliated. Let go of archaic ideas about black people, let go of ridiculous policies about black hair and let go of the need to constantly police black bodies, especially black girls. For God\u2019s sake, let our girls be girls, and let our girls learn.\n\n", "keywords": ["school", "parents", "natural", "students", "hair", "learn", "wearing", "hairstyles", "black", "girls", "let"], "polarity": 0.005687039568618517, "subjectivity": 0.4251841725525933},

Sitting there in the theater, gazing up at the gorgeous Dora Milaje, the thought occurred to you at least once: Could I pull off a bald head?\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nMaybe your answer was an immediate and unequivocal \u201cNo,\u201d but if there was even a glimmer of curiosity, let\u2019s dig into it. While women have been rocking baldies and fades for centuries now, our hair is often still considered our \u201ccrowning glory.\u201d But is the crown really what\u2019s on your head, or what\u2019s in it?\n\nWith the ongoing popularity of Marvel\u2019s Black Panther, we got not only an eyeful of epic black excellence and battle scenes, but also a bevy of bald beauties, courtesy of Wakanda\u2019s royal guard, the Dora Milaje, led by General Okoye (played by Danai Gurira), who sports not only a clean-shaven head but a tattooed one.\n\nMuch to our delight, long after shooting wrapped, Gurira continued to have fun with the look in real life; even taking to having designs etched into her reverse bald fade, which she rocked to glamorous effect at the Black Panther European premiere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Gareth Cattermole (Getty Images for Disney)\n\nBut for those of us who aren\u2019t starring in the latest Hollywood blockbuster, is this a look we can realistically pull off? To find out, we reached out to one of our favorite bald beauties, psychiatrist and occasional contributor to The Root, Dr. Imani J. Walker.\n\n\n\nWalker began shaving her head at about the age of 17 while an incoming freshman at Xavier University in New Orleans. Originally arriving at school with the popular \u201990s-era permed-and-cropped cut made famous by Halle Berry, Walker tells The Glow Up that she quickly found the need for a drastic change:\n\nSo, I got down to New Orleans, and it was like 90-something degrees and 120 percent humidity, and my hair was just\u2014I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t happening. I\u2019m not looking cute right now.\u201d And then, my roommate at the time, when we met, we had the exact same haircut. And I was like, OK; out of necessity and also because I just hate doing what everybody else is doing, I just cut it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat \u201cbig chop\u201d led to what has become Walker\u2019s trademark look for the past 25 years, a gleaming bald head she shaves every other day. A very active mom and wife on top of her duties as a doctor, she credits her choice of hairstyle\u2014or lack thereof\u2014with making her busy lifestyle simpler.\n\nI\u2019m fairly active\u2014I work out a good six, if not seven, days a week. So one of the things I really love about it is the fact that it\u2019s not, there\u2019s not anything that I have to really be concerned about ... but also on top of that, [if I\u2019m] jumping in the pool, or I\u2019m the middle of the street and the wind blows, it feels really just nice. It\u2019s just a really refreshing feeling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker also admits to us that her personal affinity for baldness is as psychological as it is physical:\n\n\n\nI guess, spiritually speaking, I\u2019ve always felt the need [for] my thoughts to be as close to the air as possible; I just need to feel like I have freedom of thought. And for me, that physically just means having the freedom to be able to have my scalp exposed to as many elements possible. But I think more than anything, I like the way it feels, and it just so happens to look good.\n\nBut Walker warns that while lower maintenance, choosing to go bald doesn\u2019t mean no maintenance. She indulges in a strict skin and scalp regimen to keep her look smooth and free of razor bumps, emphasizing that \u201cyou have to give it as much thought as you would give any type of hairstyle.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does she keep her dome glowing? By taking extreme care with the tools and products she uses. \u201cYou can\u2019t just take Barbasol shaving cream or some plastic cheap razor and just go to your head; you\u2019ll destroy your scalp,\u201d she warns. \u201cYou\u2019ll have razor bumps forever, and it\u2019s not going to be cute.\u201d\n\nTo keep her close shave extra-cute, Walker has her routine down to a science:\n\nFirst, using a barber-grade Wahl trimmer, like the GroomsMan T-Pro, specially made to give a bump-free shave, Walker shaves her entire head.\n\n\n\nNext, she goes over her head with a set of clippers\u2014she likes Wahl\u2019s Ultra Close Cut Pro, crafted specifically for close shaves but less likely to cause razor bumps. While, technically, she has a very close shave, Walker says, \u201cTo the naked eye, it looks like my head is shining.\u201d\n\nAfter shaving, Walker oil cleanses her scalp, stressing that she treats her scalp the way she treats her face, first applying an oil cleanser that she wipes off with a hot washcloth, followed by a turmeric mask to her face and scalp, which helps to decrease inflammation, and does double duty against pimples and razor bumps. Walker\u2019s homemade mask includes turmeric powder, yogurt, rosewater and lemon juice.\n\nOnce out the shower, she applies a toner with salicylic acid, which she says is \u201cvery exciting in a tingling, like, \u2018Oh my God,\u2019 kind of a way\u2014but the tingle at least lets me know that it works!\u201d Afterward, she recommends using a hydrocortisone or steroid cream on the scalp to help nip any inflammation or razor bumps in the bud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker follows this regimen religiously, shaving only every other day to cut down on irritation and get the best results.\n\nBut while Walker absolutely loves her look, she admits that she\u2019s used to getting stares from those who are unaccustomed to seeing a bald woman, which is why it was so refreshing to see the similarly styled Dora Milaje on-screen.\n\n\u201cI went to go see the movie with my son, and we talked a little bit about it after the movie, and he was like, \u2018Well, yeah, it\u2019s like an army of my mom. This is great ... it\u2019s like having my mom, but, like, 10 of them. This is amazing.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those who think a woman going bald compromises her femininity, the doctor has this to say:\n\nFemininity to a lot of people equates with being soft. Femininity to me is the ability to have the option to be soft\u2014the option to be whatever you want\u2014but more importantly, it\u2019s to be a woman and powerful. So I feel very feminine with my head shaved ... I\u2019d feel less feminine if I wore a wig or if my bald head were not on display every day. This is my head. I do what I want to do with it. And if they don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s not really my problem. ... But anybody who doesn\u2019t feel that this look is feminine, I think, needs to really re-evaluate what their insecurities are, and why they would feel the need to place their insecurities on someone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because Walker isn\u2019t the only bald baddie in our midst, we did a little roundup of a few of our other favorite beauties who\u2019ve dared to go bare\u2014or, at least, almost there.\n\nFlorence Kasumba attends the European premiere of Black Panther in London Feb. 8, 2018.

But that said, we know it\u2019s not a look every woman can pull off, as Walker aptly notes:\n\nI mean, it\u2019s not for everyone. I do think that everyone should try it, but it\u2019s not necessarily for everyone, because not [everyone\u2019s head] is necessarily evenly shaped. People have asked me \u201cWell, how did you know what your head was going to look like?\u201d I don\u2019t know, I just did it. Just do it. Just try it and see. The worst-case scenario, your hair is going to grow back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, what do you say? Do you dare to go bare?

There are countless YouTube channels, blogs, social media pages, etc., dedicated to helping black women find #HairInspo, showing them wash routines and styling techniques and reviewing hair products.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut now there\u2019s an app for that. Three black software engineers and entrepreneurs\u2014Cassandra Sarfo, Esther Olatunde and Priscilla Hazel\u2014have created Tress, an app they hope will become the one-stop shop for all your black hair needs, inspirations and appointments.\n\n\u201cWe do this all the time: We see a hairstyle that we like. We stop people on the street just to ask them where they did their hair, how much it cost them, or ask them for their stylist\u2019s number,\u201d Hazel told The Root. \u201cAnd my mom, she takes pictures of her TV screen and [messages] me and asks me where she can have it done. It\u2019s a habit that we have that we do all the time.\u201d\n\nSo the women put their heads together to come up with a solution for what they saw as an obvious demand, and the app Tress was born. The long-term goal is to make Tress a one-stop shop for all things hair, and for the platform to be a seamless integration between someone seeing a hairstyle and knowing all the products and procedures (and even people!) used to create it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it stands now, the search starts on the street or on social media with someone loving a hairstyle. Then maybe they have to search for tutorials on how to style the hair, or where to purchase specific products or extensions. Then it\u2019s a matter of, can this be done with your own two hands, or should you put your life in a stylist\u2019s hands?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re constantly moving from one platform to the other, trying to figure out how to get information on one style you want to get done. So, for us, we thought it\u2019d be cool if we could just build a platform where you can actually come and find hairstyle inspiration, interact with people who post their hairstyle, be able to purchase products for those particular hairstyles and then eventually be able to book stylists all on one platform,\u201d Hazel said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrently on the app, women can find hair inspo and filter hairstyles by the type they\u2019re looking for, or even by cost. Women can also upload and share photos of their own hairstyle, adding whatever information is necessary, and contribute to community discussions about best hair-care practices and other tips. You can see what\u2019s trending, and even bookmark hairstyles for later viewing.\n\n\n\nThe women behind the app hope that within the next six to eight months, users will be able to purchase products through the app directly. A little further into the future, the next priority will be enabling women to book hairstylists.\n\n\u201cWe want to be very city-focused. We probably will start in certain cities when it comes to booking, and even maybe purchasing products. But we want people to be in a certain city and see where they can find a stylist to have their hair done through the platform,\u201d Hazel explained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll three women behind the app are currently based in California. However, Sarfo and Hazel are originally from Ghana, while Olatunde hails from Nigeria.\n\nHazel used to do marketing of consumer products before getting interested in tech. After the field sparked her interest, she quit her job and went to school to learn as much as she could about tech. It was there she met her co-founders, who were already in the space: Sarfo has a degree in information technology, and Olatunde has a degree in computer engineering.\n\nThis is the talent that came together and founded Tress.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to work on something that affects us, especially as black women,\u201d Hazel said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHair is a big deal for us. We have one of the most unique hair types of any demographic. ... It\u2019s part of our identities, a part of our culture. It\u2019s not a matter of whether you have a lot of hair [or not],\u201d she added. \u201cHair is important for us. Hair, for black women ... is important to their fashion; it has to do with confidence. It\u2019s part of you.\u201d\n\nRight now, the free app is available on iOS and Android and has around 100,000 downloads.\n\nIn the future, the trio is hoping for much bigger things, wanting \u201cblack women\u2019s hair\u201d and Tress to become synonymous.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen you think about hair, you should think about Tress, and when you think about Tress, you think about hair for black women,\u201d Hazel said. \u201cIt should be synonymous with hair.\u201d", "keywords": ["cater", "products", "needs", "hairinspo", "tress", "hazel", "hairstyle", "think", "hair", "platform", "women", "black", "female", "hoping", "app", "techies"], "polarity": 0.11631493506493507, "subjectivity": 0.48742784992785},

Following several seasons in which we\u2019ve seen an uptick in black models wearing their natural tresses on the runways, this season\u2019s presentations boasted a remarkable number of naturally coiffed models on the catwalks.

From her home in Ivory Coast, she was gracious enough to speak with The Glow Up about her inspiration and process (Editor\u2019s note: As Ky\u2019s first language is French, there has been minor paraphrasing for clarity):\n\nI always loved everything about style in general, and hair included. I\u2019ve known how to braid since I was 4 or 5, but what really inspired me to sculpt my hair is an Instagram photo album that I saw a year ago. That album presented the hairstyles that women wore long ago in some African tribes. It made me fall in love with my African culture more than I already was before. These were really impressive and artistic, and it made me want to use the hairstyle as one of my means of expression.\n\n\u201cImpressive and artistic\u201d are certainly appropriate words to describe Ky\u2019s hair sculptures, many of which would be as at home in a Tim Burton film as in the African tribes that inspired her.

And while Ky is working on several concurrent artistic projects, using her hair as the medium in this series has been especially self-affirming:\n\nSince always, the hair of black women\u2014as well as their hairstyles\u2014were considered not pretty enough. And with the return of natural hair to the black community, hairstyle has become a beauty asset, a way of self-affirmation and a claim of its beauty. To use the hairstyle as [a] means of expression is therefore a powerful means, because it speaks to all black women who for a long time have [been made to] believe that their hair was not dope enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKy hopes to eventually exhibit and sell her series of vulnerability-inspired images\u2014but in the interim, she doesn\u2019t take the overwhelmingly positive response she\u2019s received lightly:", "keywords": ["insecurities", "ky", "away", "styling", "making", "artistic", "artist", "means", "black", "hair", "hairstory", "african", "beauty", "hairstyle", "kys", "instagram"], "polarity": 0.15338383838383834, "subjectivity": 0.5628619528619528},

But just as frequently, my dreadlocks and scalp kick my ass just as hard as my fitness regimen. And when I try to recruit a new fitness buddy, I\u2019m frequently met with frustrating rejections because of worries about their tresses; whether they\u2019ve taken the chemically relaxed route to straighten their hair or are sporting their naturally kinky coils.\n\nAs a woman of color and a fitness nut, I want to eliminate some of the anxieties from your beauty regimen and incorporate great ways to get you back in the gym. If you\u2019re committed to getting fit, here are some sweat-ready hairstyles you may want to consider:\n\n\n\nBe Protective With Braids, Twists and Cornrows\n\nProtective styles such as braids and cornrows tend to be naturally low-maintenance. These styles minimize breakage from frequent styling or various heat applications, keeping your hair intact while you work it out. After kicking ass in the gym, consider unraveling your braids and sporting a twist-out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPull It Back in a Ponytail or Bun\n\nPonytails and buns are not only easy, but versatile. Pop that hair to one side for a fun \u201980s-inspired look, or go for a classic high bun for a night out on the town after releasing all of those endorphins. Or tap into old Hollywood with a playful twist, similar to this chignon on Rihanna.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlay With a Short Do\n\nRegardless of what hair type you have, a short cut can accentuate your natural features while maintaining your chic. If done well, shorter hairstyles require less styling time than their longer counterparts. Tap into your inner Nefertiti with a fabulous high-top, or take your cues from Halle Berry and mimic her legendary gorgeous short haircuts.\n\n\n\nHide It in a Head Wrap\n\nPlenty of women\u2014including myself\u2014have embraced wearing head wraps because of their versatility and practicality. Interestingly enough, there\u2019s an abundance of head-wrap history in African and Afro-Brazilian culture. If you\u2019re curious, check out this Nigerian Ankara head-wrap tutorial, or follow Franchesca Ramsey\u2019s one-minute video on how to rock that printed scarf that\u2019s been collecting dust for months.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDevote Yourself to Dreadlocks\n\nDon\u2019t chop my head off. Yes, I did say I go through issues, too, but honestly, dreadlocks are very forgiving. However, please bear in mind that they are permanent. But like some of the aforementioned styles, you can cornrow your dreadlocks into braids, throw them into a sloppy bun or keep them in place with a stylish head wrap. If you don\u2019t want to commit, consider faux locs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBe Unbeweavable\n\nI didn\u2019t forget about my girls who love their sew-ins. While this is not just a tip for women who wear weaves, I heavily suggest wearing a headband or scarf to protect your edges. Wrap your hair and place a stocking cap on top before using a silk scarf or cap on top; that will allow you to protect your tresses and look presentable.\n\n\n\nBut wait: Here\u2019s a bit more info on protecting your hair while perfecting your health:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat to Do When Your Workout Is Done\n\nIf you have the ability, wash your hair with a good shampoo. When my locs require TLC, I prefer natural remedies, like soaking my hair for 10 minutes in an apple-cider vinegar wash to remove impurities from my locs. It\u2019s not something I\u2019d suggest doing all of the time\u2014doing this too much can screw up your hair\u2019s pH balance.\n\nIn between washes, using a dry shampoo on your roots goes a long way toward removing dirt and residue from your hair. After your workout, spritz your scalp with coconut oil, an olive oil sheen or even tea tree oil. For those who wear locs or braids, take it a step further by using peppermint or rosemary oil to remove any musty scents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf your hair or scalp is damp underneath your sew-in, blow-dry your hair on a lower setting. A moist, sweaty scalp can lead to a foul odor and retain buildup, damaging your actual hair. And applying too much heat on a regular basis will cause hair breakage.\n\n\n\nRemember to alternate your hairstyles every now and then. Some days, I allow my hair to do its own thing. Brushing or pulling your hair in the same direction can cause traction alopecia over time\u2014and nobody has time for that.\n\nI may not have all of the answers to your specific hair-care needs, but at the intersection of beauty and fitness, I hope this aids you in getting back into a regimen that you love.\n\n", "keywords": ["oil", "reluctant", "short", "braids", "head", "using", "protect", "tips", "enthusiast", "tresses", "hair", "styles", "fitness", "haircare", "scalp", "scarf"], "polarity": 0.16237208147044208, "subjectivity": 0.4462535824830907},

The moment you sit in the chair and the stylist wraps the cape around you is the moment you begin to be magically transformed.\n\n\n\nBut the mythology\u2014and reality\u2014of black beauty shops isn\u2019t just about the stylists; it\u2019s the culture, the rhythm. It\u2019s the lady up the street who takes lunch and dinner soul food orders and the brotha with bootleg movies stopping through on a Saturday morning; the gospel music in some spots and the hip-hop or trap music in others. It\u2019s generations of women from one family either working in the shop or getting their hair done in that same shop. For many black women, the shop is a second home where we create family ties through nurturing our hair.\n\n\n\nWhen I saw Chris Rock\u2019s 2009 documentary Good Hair, I was surprised to learn that black hair care is a multibillion-dollar business. Most of us don\u2019t think about those numbers; what\u2019s always been most important to me\u2014as I\u2019m sure it is for other folks\u2014is to find a shop that aesthetically makes me feel comfortable and at home. I want to be in a place where the business practices are exceptional and the stylist cares about my hair. But for me, the black beauty shop experience is also complicated by my identities as a lesbian, butch woman and a black/biracial person.\n\nI grew up in the black church\u2014which meant long services, skeevy deacons, wilding-out preachers\u2019 kids (PKs) and older women who absolutely ran the church, regardless of the pastor. But one of the things I remember most from my religious education is that a woman\u2019s hair is her \u201ccrowning glory,\u201d which meant you had to be very cautious about how you cut or styled your hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a kid, I had thick, curly locks that at one point extended down to my butt. People gushed over my hair, but quite frankly, I hated it. I never quite understood what to do with it, and it never held a relaxer like my friends\u2019 hair did.\n\nAs I got older, I felt even more alienated from black beauty shops because of my own relationship with race. I was adopted into a black family, so I had a clear understanding of my blackness from a very young age. But it wasn\u2019t until I was older that I began to explore the nuances of being light-skinned, black and also biracial. The push and pull of being accepted by black folk who weren\u2019t sure whether I was \u201cblack enough\u201d felt constant. And that push and pull extended to the relationship I had with my hair, and my identity as a butch woman.\n\nFor me, long hair was not part of my butch identity. It indicated a femininity that felt uncomfortable, and I needed a stylist and salon that understood and respected that. The choice to cut my hair was the most liberating feeling I\u2019d ever experienced, aside from coming out to the world and myself. But it took a long time for me to find the right person and the right shop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve been in hair salons with a heavy evangelical Christian energy, where people consider Harry Potter \u201cblack magic\u201d and implore folks to beware of the churches with rainbow flags, because that\u2019s where \u201cthose people\u201d go to church.\n\nI\u2019ve been in salons where the stylist criticized my hair just for being my hair. I\u2019ve been in salons where I was simply a number in a chair. And, of course, we\u2019ve all had a salon experience where your appointment is at 9 a.m. and you don\u2019t get out of the chair until 5 p.m.\n\nAt a certain point, I knew I needed a place with a mixture of great energy, client-centered service and stylists who wanted me to love my hair as much as they loved doing hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was lucky to find Consciously Beautiful salon in St. Paul, Minn., through a friend who wears her hair natural in intricate braided styles. My relationship with stylist and owner Marla Smith is intense and intimate; she knows me almost as well as my partner of 18 years.\n\nShe was the first stylist to tell me that my hair has an actual identity (spiral corkscrew 3a), and the only stylist to identify my partner\u2019s formerly inflamed scalp as a sign of lactose intolerance and recommend that she lay off dairy for a while. Recently, she recommended that I use a little coconut oil before adding product so that my hair doesn\u2019t dry out in the harsh Minnesota winter.\n\nMarla says she decided to go into hair care because she wanted to do something she could be passionate about. And though she loves black women\u2019s hair, her clientele is diverse and spans different types of identities and people. And most importantly, her spot is a place that has great healing energy. Every month, I leave her spot relaxed, rejuvenated and filled with joy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know there are women who work in barbershops, and butch lesbians and straight women alike who get their hair cut in barbershops, but my personal politic is that I don\u2019t belong in black barbershops. There are so few places where black men are able to be vulnerable with one another that it just doesn\u2019t feel right for me to be there.\n\nBut I\u2019ve also had plenty of moments where I felt out of place in black beauty shops. I\u2019ve often felt like I was eavesdropping on black women\u2019s vulnerability in a space where femme black women have felt their safest to talk about their partners, their children, their relationships with their mothers and other women in their lives, and maybe\u2014at their most raucous\u2014whether they should be the first one to text their new love back after a night of getting their backs blown out.\n\nMy place in black beauty shops has often been fraught with deciding what part of my identity must take precedence over the other. At this point in my life, I feel lucky I no longer have to worry about that, but that\u2019s not the case for every butch woman. Understanding our place within black and primarily femme women\u2019s spaces can be complicated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I love the scents of black beauty salons and the energy of black women. We are divine, complex individuals\u2014even in our most hood and ratchet moments\u2014and in those spaces, we find ways to make joy and community.\n\nThankfully, I\u2019ve found a space\u2014a space where my stylist literally and figuratively weaves magic\u2014where I don\u2019t have to decide which of my identities gets to show up. For Marla, I am Stephanie: black/biracial, butch, lesbian, a client she respects, and whose success she roots for.

The then-Brown University student breezed through the competition, ultimately landing first runner-up while showing a generation of black girls how to proudly rock natural styles.\n\n@KayoticRedDreams via YouTube\n\nIn the years since, she has transitioned from a successful modeling career into critically acclaimed acting roles in film and television, including roles in The Kids Are All Right and The Butler, and portraying the late Whitney Houston in the Angela Bassett-helmed Lifetime biopic Whitney.\n\nHer talent and steadily rising profile ultimately landed her her first leading role on the hit show Chicago Med as nurse April Sexton, an experience she likens to an \u201camazing university.\u201d\n\nDaCosta is also no stranger to red carpets, reliably dazzling onlookers with both her fashion sense and ever-evolving repertoire of (mostly natural) hairstyles. So when she appeared on a pre-Emmy party step-and-repeat last summer with a sleek, fresh crop, suffice to say, heads turned. After all, who expected a woman so identified with her natural mane to undergo the \u201cbig chop\u201d? In conversation with The Glow Up, she explains that it was one of the best decisions she ever made:\n\nIt\u2019s funny, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m comfortable calling it the \u201cbig chop.\u201d When I first heard about that term, I thought it was more connected to women who were going natural, and were chopping off processed hair. But maybe it\u2019s not specific to that. Maybe it\u2019s just cutting your hair off ... I\u2019ve had the same hair my entire life. I was born with a very full \u2019fro, so, it\u2019s never\u2014even as a baby\u2014been as short as it is right now. So it\u2019s definitely a new world. I have so much more free time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYaya DaCosta rocks her formerly full mane during NBC\u2019s Chicago Med panel discussion Aug. 13, 2015. (Frederick M.

From a high schooler once given the superlative of \u201cmost hairstyles in one year\u201d to a college co-ed visible across campus rocking a big \u2019fro before natural hair was back in fashion, she\u2019s consistently followed her own instincts when it comes to her crown and is happy to see other women doing the same:\n\nYou know, obviously we have pictures of some of our moms, or aunts or grandmothers in the \u201970s with Afros. But there was a long time when natural hair was not accepted. And so it\u2019s really great for me to see this\u2014I guess it\u2019s being called a \u201cmovement\u201d\u2014women just learning how to care for what comes out of their heads. And it\u2019s nice to have people feel like they have more options, you know? Because we can always do what we want to do, or what we feel comfortable doing\u2014whether it\u2019s a weave or it\u2019s a perm or anything else. But it\u2019s when we don\u2019t feel like we have an option that it becomes a problem; when it then becomes a societal issue, rather than a personal decision. But there\u2019s a cult mentality that\u2019s crept into the movement that I\u2019m not really supportive of. I think it has a lot to do with something that happens when people convert to a lot of things. It\u2019s always the recent converts\u2014whether it be religious dogma or philosophy or anything else\u2014that tend to be really extreme. I live in a little less of an extreme world, in my personal life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, even her decision to crop her famous locks was initially met with more opposition than support. But after years of joking about taking the leap, DaCosta ultimately took the decision in stride: \u201cI was walking down the street, and as crazy as this may sound, I heard a voice\u2014maybe it was my own inner voice or higher self\u2014just say, \u2018Cut your hair.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter considering it late into the night, she lit some candles, sat down in front of her computer and recorded a conversation with herself, contemplating all of the things she would be releasing by cutting her hair:\n\nAnd when I tell you, after childbirth, that was the most powerful experience of my life. I cried, I hugged and kissed myself; it was amazing. And I never looked back. I always thought when people do that, the next day they wake up, like, \u201cOh my God, what did I do? I ruined my life.\u201d I didn\u2019t. I felt good about it. ... There\u2019s so much that has happened since [then] that I know would not have been possible had I been weighed down by the weight that I was carrying; the toxic relationships, other people\u2019s expectations of me, safety, hiding, not feeling beautiful without it. ... One of the things that I cut off as well was fear, and in doing so, realized how guided I was, not by love or confidence, but fear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConfidence is an issue DaCosta confesses to having struggled with in younger years. She recalls an experience early on in her professional acting career, when her father presented her with a unique challenge:\n\nHe goes, \u201cI just have one question: \u2018Where does your confidence come from?\u2019 Don\u2019t answer now\u2014just think about it\u201d ... I think that that was\u2014it was an invitation to step into the answer, to figure out what it was. And it\u2019s something that I guess is from life, when you\u2019re ready to come into yourself. And it can\u2019t be forced and it can\u2019t be faked. And you know, it\u2019s amazing having all these mirrors around me now, and people, and relationships, and just seeing how the types of people coming into my life now are different. And I\u2019m so inspired by them, and they\u2019re a reflection of the work that I\u2019ve been doing to answer that question.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while DaCosta has every intention of growing her hair back\u2014healthier and with new energy and genuine confidence\u2014taking the risk has come back to reward her tenfold, especially as she becomes more aware of the impact her image has had on others:", "keywords": ["images", "talks", "yaya", "natural", "2016", "growth", "dacosta", "chop", "big", "growing", "2015", "know", "hair", "teamnatural", "life", "meds", "chicago", "premiere"], "polarity": 0.1759024490002751, "subjectivity": 0.5000853454114325},

Now my hair is a few inches past my shoulders and longer and thicker than it ever was when it was relaxed.\n\n\n\nI give all the glory in my natural-hair journey to Lenelle Howell, the person who convinced me to go natural, but who is also the person who used to give me relaxers. I know I\u2019m supposed to give all glory to God, but as a black woman (and an agnostic), the closest thing I know to a deity is Lenelle, my hairdresser. She is my alpha and omega. My comforter in times of need. She is my rock in a weary land, and often\u2014when she finishes a new hairdo\u2014I have screamed \u201cHallelujah\u201d and done a Holy Ghost dance.\n\nI met Lenelle in 2010 when I was in an abusive relationship\u2014with my hair. My strands were broken, abused and in desperate need of some tender loving care. While it sometimes takes stylists a few weeks to get the hang of what a client desires, she immediately knew how to transform my sad-ass strands into something happy and manageable.\n\nInitially, I would wash my hair during off-weeks and have her do my touch-ups, occasionally treating myself to a simple wash-and-set (if I was feeling like a rich bitch). Soon it became painfully obvious which weeks she did my hair and which weeks I did, so eventually I decided not to derail her efforts to make my hair healthy and became a pampered weekly client.\n\nI consistently received compliments on my hair, and my Lenelle addiction got so bad that I\u2019d fly to my out-of-town job during the week and fly home simply to have her do work on my locks. She was like my dealer\u2014I\u2019m now convinced that\u2019s why they call it getting one\u2019s hair \u201cfixed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not sure when Lenelle and I crossed over from client and stylist to friends, but we did. She wasn\u2019t just my hair\u2019s caretaker; she provided me with an outlet that facilitated my emotional health on so many days. But shortly after she convinced me to adopt the natural-hair lifestyle (ugh ... I can\u2019t believe I just wrote that), I moved from Orlando, Fla., to Atlanta. Atlanta probably has more natural hairstylists per capita than any other place in the country, but none of them was my hairstylist. It was only after my big move that I realized the space Lenelle occupied in my life, and how much I missed her.\n\nRecently we were on the phone for about a half an hour, but only about five minutes of the conversation centered on my hair. We talked about career, men and life; we caught up like I was sitting in her chair. She said something that really resonated with me: \u201cKyla, people don\u2019t know how sensitive you truly are.\u201d\n\nShe wasn\u2019t talking about my hair.\n\nShe would know. She\u2019s seen me completely break down in her chair when my amour du jour wasn\u2019t acting right. She\u2019s seen me in slumps of feeling unlovable, unappreciated and unsure of my next move in life. She\u2019s been my hairdresser from when I was doing poetry as an out-of-control hobby to when it became my full-time job. She\u2019s been a career counselor, a psychologist and a newfound sister.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor black women, the salon has always been a staple of the community, second only to the black church. Beauty salons and barbershops are the institutional centerpieces of black neighborhoods. They are where people talk politics, get the latest \u201ctea,\u201d network, organize community events and even patronize smaller businesses. If you\u2019re having a party or a protest and you need black people\u2019s help, just go to where they\u2019re getting their hair done.\n\nConsider that Madam C.J. Walker, one of the first black millionaires, was a woman selling hair-care products, and that today, black women spend about nine times as much as their nonblack counterparts on hair-care products, it is safe to say that hair is important to black women. The black hairdresser is the high priestess and No. 1 practitioner of #BlackGirlMagic. She can take the homeliest-looking woman and transform her into a veritable snack. Voil\u00e0\u2014magic!\n\nNot only does a black hairdresser have to be dexterously skilled, but she\u2019s also the gatekeeper to intimate secrets. She is the protector, with \u201cWatch out, I\u2019ve heard about him\u201d certainty. She laughs when it\u2019s time to laugh, and heals when it is time to heal, all while standing on her feet all day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe black salon is a transformation chamber, home to hourly Cinderella stories, where black women can forget the pressures of the world\u2014even if they have to sacrifice hot-ass ears under the dryer.\n\nAfter Lenelle\u2019s intervention, my locks are now out of detox and doing much better. Having natural hair has admittedly saved me a lot of time and money, while making my hair much healthier than when I was addicted to the creamy crack. In the past year, I\u2019ve only gone to the salon twice.\n\nBut I miss my weekly therapy sessions with my counselor. I miss the ritual of sitting on Lenelle\u2019s altar to receive her healing blessings. I miss the safe space of being surrounded by women laughing and sharing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI miss my friend.", "keywords": ["woman", "natural", "shes", "surviving", "ive", "weeks", "going", "know", "hair", "women", "miss", "lenelle", "black", "hairdresser", "missed", "breakup"], "polarity": 0.06577585377585381, "subjectivity": 0.4640754208754209},
