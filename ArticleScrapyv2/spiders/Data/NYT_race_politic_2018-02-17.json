We go into this cleareyed that this is going to be quite a challenging election.\u201d\n\nBut Republicans have a significant structural advantage as they try to protect their one-seat majority in November: They are defending just eight seats, while Democrats have to protect 26, including those of two independents who caucus with them. Of the seats Democrats are trying to retain, 10 are in states that Mr. Trump carried in 2016.\n\nAnd after struggling to woo top-tier candidates in some states, Republicans are starting to find more success as they receive a lift from the tax overhaul they passed in December. In addition to Mr. Romney, Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, after heavy lobbying by Mr. McConnell and Mr. Trump, reversed himself and said on Friday that he would challenge Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat seeking re-election in a state that the president won by 36 points.\n\nPhoto\n\nAdvisers to Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, in an indication that he intends to challenge Senator Bill Nelson, a third-term Democrat, have moved to set up a \u201csuper PAC,\u201d according to two Republican officials. And Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, after saying he would not run again and ridiculing Mr. Trump, indicated this past week that he may not retire after all.\n\nMr. Corker\u2019s public misgivings, however, have complicated the Tennessee race, where Representative Marsha Blackburn, a staunch conservative, was already lining up support, and where Democrats landed a formidable candidate, former Gov. Phil Bredesen.\n\nMr. McConnell, who is close to Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, an ally of Mr. Corker, was guarded in his comments about the election, but he chuckled when pressed on the incumbent\u2019s apparent change of heart.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt does underscore that people want to be in the Senate,\u201d he said, trying to make the best of what could become a messy primary contest. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a different environment from late summer, early fall,\u201d when the Republicans were stung by their failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nEqually delicate is the fate of Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi, who at 80 has had a series of health problems and whose seat is being eyed by a hard-line state senator, Chris McDaniel, who nearly beat him in a bitter 2014 primary race.\n\nMr. McConnell called it \u201cpremature\u201d to assess the prospect of a special election this year to replace Mr. Cochran, but did acknowledge that \u201cthere could be\u201d one. \u201cIt\u2019s up to Senator Cochran to make that decision,\u201d he said.\n\nPrivately, though, Republicans are already scrambling to protect Mr. Cochran\u2019s seat. Party leaders fear that a candidacy by Mr. McDaniel could create a competitive race, and perhaps even spiral into a debacle similar to what happened in Alabama last year, when Roy S. Moore\u2019s loss gave the state\u2019s Democrats their first Senate election victory in 25 years.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Phil Bryant of Mississippi found himself buttonholed by the president, who, citing the Moore disaster, said that Mr. Bryant should appoint himself to Mr. Cochran\u2019s seat should it become vacant, according to a Republican official briefed on the conversation.\n\nMr. McConnell has also privately encouraged Mr. Bryant to take the seat if it becomes available, but the governor has so far resisted the entreaties. Republicans close to Mr. Cochran, who is the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, say that while he is not ruling out stepping down this year, he will not contemplate quitting until Congress finishes its 2018 spending bill next month.\n\nMore broadly, Mr. McConnell said he was open to intervening in some party primary contests, as he did in the Tea Party era, but would do so on a state-by-state basis.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe made clear he was supporting Representative Martha McSally of Arizona, who is running against a pair of immigration hawks to replace Senator Jeff Flake. And he said he did not want to see Don Blankenship, the former coal mine owner imprisoned for violating federal mine safety standards, become the party\u2019s standard-bearer against Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia.\n\nMr. McConnell harshly criticized a series of red-state Democrats, but took repeated aim at Mr. Manchin, with whom he has tangled in the past and is plainly eager to beat in a state that has otherwise embraced the Republican Party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cJoe thinks he can just kind of talk his way through all of this, but talk is really cheap when your record doesn\u2019t meet the rhetoric,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, noting Mr. Manchin\u2019s opposition to a series of Republican measures, including the tax bill.\n\nMr. McConnell acknowledged that some of his candidates were struggling to raise money \u2014 \u201cI concede the fund-raising problem,\u201d he said. But he said it was largely the result of having to face so many incumbents, who are typically better able to draw donors.\n\nStill, he said that a Supreme Court case, scheduled to be argued on Feb. 26, that is expected to curb the ability of public sector unions to automatically deduct dues from their members could have an impact on Democratic fund-raising.\n\nHe called the case \u201can example\u201d of why he had found it so important to block former President Barack Obama from replacing Antonin Scalia on the court after his death in 2016, a move that Democrats remain bitter about.\n\nAnd, without being prompted, Mr. McConnell said he hoped that the court would broadly address what he described as the left\u2019s effort to outlaw gerrymandering.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think the founding fathers had in mind when they gave it to the state legislatures?\u201d he said of redistricting powers. \u201cThey thought it was going to be a political exercise.\u201d\n\nWhile eager to trumpet the tax measure, Mr. McConnell said that \u201cthe single best thing we\u2019ve done, in conjunction with the administration, are the court appointments,\u201d including that of Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.\n\nAnd even though he and Mr. Trump heatedly clashed over the summer, Mr. McConnell said he had \u201cno complaint\u201d about the president today.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s re-election, however, will not be Mr. McConnell\u2019s top priority in 2020: The famously competitive senator, who will be 78 at that point, revealed that he is fully committed to running for re-election and chided this reporter for not assuming as much.", "keywords": ["democrats", "romneys", "republicans", "candidacy", "mr", "seat", "senator", "trump", "mcconnell", "republican", "senate", "state"], "polarity": 0.1384586940836941, "subjectivity": 0.395093795093795},

The company\u2019s business depends on people being highly engaged with what is posted on its sites, which in turn helps make it a marquee destination for advertisers.\n\nWhen suggestions first arose after the 2016 election that Facebook may have influenced the outcome, Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, dismissed the concerns. But by last September, Facebook had disclosed that the Internet Research Agency had bought divisive ads on hot-button issues through the company. It later said 150 million Americans had seen the Russian propaganda on the social network and Instagram.\n\nThe resulting firestorm has damaged Facebook\u2019s reputation. Company officials, along with executives from Google and YouTube, were grilled by lawmakers last fall. Facebook has since hired thousands of people to help monitor content and has worked with Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel leading the investigation into Russian election interference. It has also changed its advertising policy so that any ad that mentions a candidate\u2019s name goes through a more stringent vetting process. Mr. Zuckerberg has vowed to not let Facebook be abused by bad actors.\n\nYet Facebook\u2019s multiple mentions in Friday\u2019s indictment renew questions of why the world\u2019s biggest social media company didn\u2019t catch the Russian activity earlier or do more to stop it. How effective the company\u2019s new efforts to reduce foreign manipulation have been is also unclear.\n\nRob Goldman, Facebook\u2019s vice president of advertising, waded into the discussion on Friday with a series of tweets that argued that Russia\u2019s goal was to sow chaos among the electorate rather than to force a certain outcome in the election. On Saturday, President Trump cited those tweets as evidence that Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign was not aimed at handing him a victory.\n\nIn Silicon Valley, where Facebook has its headquarters, some critics pilloried the company after the indictment became public.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

Facebook does just the opposite, enabling every user to have a unique set of facts, driving the country apart for profit.\u201d\n\nJoel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global policy, said in a statement that the company was grateful the government was taking action \u201cagainst those who abused our service and exploited the openness of our democratic process.\u201d\n\nHe added that Facebook was working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation ahead of this year\u2019s midterm elections to ensure that a similar manipulation campaign would not take place. \u201cWe know we have more to do to prevent against future attacks,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook has previously questioned whether law enforcement should be more involved in helping to stop the threat from nation state actors. Facebook said it worked closely with the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\n\nYouTube did not respond to a request for comment, while Twitter declined to comment. PayPal said in a statement that it has worked closely with law enforcement and \u201cis intensely focused on combating and preventing the illicit use of our services.\u201d\n\nAccording to the indictment, the Internet Research Agency, created in 2014 in St. Petersburg and employing about 80 people, was given the job of interfering with elections and political processes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe group began using American social media to achieve those aims in 2014, when it started making Facebook pages dedicated to social issues like race and religion. Over the next two years, the indictment said, the Russians stole the identities of real Americans to create fake personas and fake accounts on social media. The group then used those to populate and promote Facebook pages like United Muslims of America, Blacktivist and Secured Borders.\n\nPhoto\n\nBy 2016, the indictment said, the size of some of these Russian-controlled Facebook groups had ballooned to hundreds of thousands of followers.\n\nThe Russians then used these groups to push various messages, including telling Americans not to vote in the 2016 election for either Mr. Trump or his opponent, Hillary Clinton. In October 2016, according to the indictment, one Russian-controlled Instagram account called Woke Blacks posted a message saying: \u201cHatred for Trump is misleading the people and forcing Blacks to vote Killary. We cannot resort to the lesser of two devils. Then we\u2019d surely be better off without voting AT ALL.\u201d\n\nAround 2015, according to the indictment, the Russians also started purchasing ads on Facebook and other social media sites like Twitter, targeting specific communities within the United States. The group used stolen PayPal accounts to pay for the ads and to promote posts, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on the outreach.\n\nIn one ad, published to promote a Facebook event called \u201cDown with Hillary,\u201d an image of Mrs. Clinton was shown with a black \u201cX\u201d painted across her face. The text read, \u201cHillary Clinton is the co-author of Obama\u2019s anti-police and anti-Constitutional propaganda.\u201d\n\nBy mid-2016, according to the indictment, the Russians were using their fake Facebook personas to organize political rallies in the United States. That June, for example, posing as the United Muslims of America on Facebook, they promoted a rally called \u201cSupport Hillary. Save American Muslims.\u201d For an August 2016 event organized through Facebook, the Russians also paid for a cage to be built that was large enough to hold an actress depicting Mrs. Clinton in a prison uniform.\n\nAt every step, the Russians used Facebook\u2019s own tools to make sure their propaganda was as effective as possible. Those tools allowed them to get real-time results on which types of ad campaigns were reaching their target audience or which posts were getting the most engagement with viewers.\n\nResearchers said that those tools are still widely available and that while the company has worked to remove fake accounts and stem the flow of disinformation, it has refused to let outside researchers examine the data on how Russian actors used the platform so effectively.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking steps to fix this, but there\u2019s no easy solution,\u201d Anton Vuljaj, a Republican media strategist who has advised campaigns and media groups, said of Facebook and other social media companies. \u201cThis also shows that the public needs to be more vigilant about what is real and what is not online.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["discord", "russians", "media", "indictment", "company", "russian", "stir", "social", "used", "turned", "facebook", "tools", "2016"], "polarity": 0.10541565656565653, "subjectivity": 0.36454033189033197},

The Americans argued they were just matching Russian capabilities and charged that Moscow was in continued violation of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces agreement, limiting tactical weapons.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet the cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and others, and the use of Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms to spread propaganda, dominated the discussion and reflected how quickly the use of these techniques has become the new battleground in a very different kind of post-Cold War conflict.\n\nThe White House cybercoordinator, Rob Joyce, was particularly direct in his accusations that Russia was behind the broad attack on Ukraine last June, called \u201cNotPetya.\u201d He described the attack as \u201cindiscriminate\u201d and noted that it paralyzed operations far beyond Ukraine, the intended target, and included the Maersk shipping system. He said the United States would retaliate, but did not say how, adding \u201cwe will not telegraph these punches.\u201d\n\nMr. Joyce is no newcomer to offensive cyberoperations; previously he ran the Tailored Access Operations unit of the National Security Agency, overseeing American cyberaction against other counties. \u201cWe are going to conduct cyberoperations,\u201d he said.

Cities like Chicago and Baltimore, with rigorous gun laws, also have two of the highest murder rates in the country. The black market for illegal guns has thrived in those cities, with gang members and criminals turning to the streets to get firearms.\n\nAnd the drop in fatal shootings in Connecticut has occurred in the context of a broad, long-term decline in violent crime across the country. Citing F.B.I. statistics, the Pew Research Center reports that violent crime fell 48 percent from 1993 to 2016.\n\nGun-rights groups say the problem is not the guns, but the individuals using them. They argue that laws alone are no panacea, and that social issues like mental illness and unemployment must be addressed to help curb gun violence. Some gun advocates have also called for more training and security for those who legally and responsibly maintain guns.\n\nStill, with little appetite in Congress to take on gun control, the debate is playing out at the state level, with Connecticut seen as a model for gun-control advocates.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cConnecticut\u2019s laws are among the nation\u2019s toughest and homicides are down,\u201d Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said. \u201cObviously the link is a circumstantial one; cause and effect can\u2019t be proven conclusively. But the numbers are all in the right direction. States like Connecticut can help shame Congress into adopting common-sense measures that keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people.\u201d\n\nState officials say Connecticut has experienced the fastest drop in violent crime of any state over the last four years. Gun-control advocates say the suspect in Florida, Nikolas Cruz, could not have bought the AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle believed used in the attack, or the high-capacity magazines, in Connecticut.\n\n\u201cWe really need to do a better job at making sure we have strong gun laws in every state in the country, because we are losing our most valuable resource, which is our children,\u201d said Jeremy I. Stein, the executive director of CT Against Gun Violence, a nonprofit advocacy group.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven in Connecticut, where parents of the children killed at Sandy Hook met with lawmakers as they debated the legislation, the measures fell short of what gun-control advocates wanted. For example, the laws did not force residents to relinquish existing assault weapons and high-capacity magazines or limit the number of firearms people could own.\n\nAt a hearing a month after the Newtown shooting, some speakers talked of the need to hold people accountable. \u201cThe problem is not gun laws. The problem is a lack of civility,\u201d said Mark Mattioli, whose son James, 6, was killed at Sandy Hook Elementary.\n\nThe Giffords Center, which keeps a state-by-state report card, gave Connecticut an A-minus for its gun laws \u2014 the same grade given to New York, which moved even more swiftly after Sandy Hook to pass stricter laws. The center ranked Connecticut 46th and New York 48th for their gun death rates, among the five lowest in the United States.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIn New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed a law a month after the massacre at Sandy Hook that is, in some respects, stricter than the one in Connecticut. The New York law not only bans the sale of assault weapons and imposes universal background checks, it also prohibits both the sale \u2014 and possession \u2014 of magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds. And it requires mental health professionals to alert the authorities about at-risk patients who should not be allowed to buy a firearm. As of Feb. 8, 77,447 people deemed to be dangerously mentally ill had been added to the database.\n\nAvery W. Gardiner, a president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said that generally, blue states are, not surprisingly, more likely to regulate guns and require background checks and licensing. Conservative red states either lack gun-safety laws or fail to enforce the ones they have. Her group\u2019s strategy includes filing lawsuits to enforce existing safety laws and countering the gun lobby, which uses its muscle in statehouses as well as Congress.\n\nThe lobbying has been hard on both sides. According to the nonpartisan National Institute on Money in State Politics, in the past three election cycles the National Rifle Association, the nation\u2019s leading gun lobby, spent a total of $10.6 million to support candidates for state office in 25 states. Between 2009 and 2016, at least two-thirds of that spending went to state contests in which the group\u2019s chosen candidate won.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cFlorida has gone the wrong way since Sandy Hook for sensible laws,\u201d Ms. Gardiner said, citing a Florida law that would have restricted doctors from even asking patients about gun safety. The Brady Center sued Florida on the grounds that the law violated the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of free speech, and a year ago a panel of federal judges ruled in the center\u2019s favor.\n\nIn Connecticut, the question of magazine capacity became emotionally charged as the stricter gun laws were being debated. That is because the Sandy Hook attacker, Adam Lanza, like other mass gunmen, used high-capacity magazines that allowed him to rapidly fire 30 rounds. A group of first graders at Sandy Hook ran past Mr. Lanza, escaping from the hail of bullets when he had to stop and reload.\n\nAt a news conference in April 2013, on the day lawmakers announced an agreement on gun control, Nicole Hockley, whose son, Dylan, died at Sandy Hook, said: \u201cWe ask ourselves every day \u2014 every minute \u2014 if those magazines had held 10 rounds, forcing the shooter to reload at least six more times, would our children be alive today?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nConnecticut\u2019s sweeping gun laws did, however, require residents who already owned high-capacity magazines and assault rifles to register them with the State Police. Today, the registry lists 52,648 assault weapons. A single resident registered 179 assault weapons, while another registered more than 500,000 magazines exceeding the 10-round limit. Between 2013 and 2017, 248 people were charged with illegally possessing an assault weapon because they either failed to register an existing weapon or had bought a weapon after the law went into effect.\n\nThe state also requires that individuals admitted to psychiatric hospitals relinquish their guns, at least temporarily. The State Police is notified of such patients by the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, which maintains a database, and ensures that upon discharge, the gun owner turns in the weapon or transfers it to someone eligible for a gun permit. In addition, people who were previously treated in a mental hospital cannot get a permit for up to two years afterward.\n\nThe National Shooting Sports Foundation, a lobby group in Newtown, Conn., declined to comment on the impact of Connecticut\u2019s gun laws \u201cout of respect for the families, the community and the ongoing law enforcement investigation\u201d in Parkland, Fla. The National Rifle Association did not respond to a request to comment.\n\nConnecticut is also one of a few states with another gun law with some teeth \u2014 an \u201cextreme risk protection order.\u201d Akin to a restraining order for domestic violence victims, the protection order, which predates Sandy Hook, gives the police the power to temporarily take away an individual\u2019s guns if a person makes threats, acts violently, abuses drugs or commits animal cruelty.\n\nIn the Florida massacre, the authorities believe that the gunman may have made threatening comments on social media, including one last September \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m going to be a professional school shooter\u201d \u2014 and had also posted a photo of a bloodied frog.\n\nA study that examined Connecticut\u2019s risk protection order found that, from 1999 to 2013, 99 percent of warrants led to the confiscation of at least one gun. In nearly half the cases, the gun owner wound up receiving psychiatric treatment.\n\nMike Lawlor, the criminal justice adviser to Governor Malloy, said that the law arose from two high-profile shootings in the 1990s by people with severe mental health issues. \u201cWhen there\u2019s no law that\u2019s actually been broken, but when there is real evidence that the person is a danger to others, the police need to have an option,\u201d he said. \u201cStep one is to get the guns.\u201d", "keywords": ["advocates", "magazines", "laws", "florida", "sandy", "law", "hook", "look", "connecticut", "york", "guns", "guncontrol", "gun", "wake", "state", "massacre"], "polarity": -0.025332773802161566, "subjectivity": 0.4034589701681538},

Bystrov\n\nMr. Bystrov is a retired St. Petersburg police colonel who, according to the indictment, joined the company in February 2014 and became its highest-ranking official. He also led shell entities that were used to conceal its activities, including one called Glavset, a so-called database and information company. It shared an address \u2014 55 Savushkina Street \u2014 with the Internet Research Agency. (The troll farm has since moved to Optikov Street, according to the local press.)\n\n\n\nThe troll farm soon drew notice in Russia: news outlets reported that it employed 250 people in 12-hour shifts to provide a round-the-clock flow of pro-Kremlin posts and comments, praising Mr. Putin and excoriating President Barack Obama and President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine. Monthly salaries ranged from $1,100 for a junior analyst to $1,400 for a blogger to $4,200 a month for senior management.\n\nMr. Bystrov, who is believed to be 59, has avoided reporters and declined interview requests.\n\nThe Executive Director: Mikhail L. Burchik\n\nPhoto\n\nA young tech entrepreneur, Mr. Burchik, 31, joined the company in October 2013 and became its executive director, the No. 2 official, by March 2014, according to the indictment.\n\nAccording to online records, he registered a company in 2009 called Add1.ru that was behind a 2014 hoax. In that hoax, a young woman in aviator sunglasses calling herself Zoe Foreman spent hours spamming politicians and journalists about a horrific \u2014 and fictitious \u2014 chemical plant explosion in Louisiana.\n\n\u201cI have heard of it, but I don\u2019t work in this organization,\u201d he told the journalist Adrian Chen, who wrote about the troll farm in 2015 for The New York Times Magazine. He said he had bought and sold many internet domains and didn\u2019t remember them all.\n\nMr. Burchik also won government contracts to publish local municipal newspapers, organize lectures and do some video reports.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThroughout the troll farm\u2019s operations to interfere in American politics, including the election, \u201cBurchik was a manager involved in operational planning, infrastructure and personnel,\u201d according to the indictment.\n\nThe business news website RBC reported on Friday that Mr. Burchik claimed not to know English well enough to understand what he had been accused of. \u201cIf a few hundred million Americans are so worried about the activities of a regular Russian small-business man from the IT-sphere doing website development, then it seems the situation in the country is completely grave,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Burchik told Komsomolskaya Pravda, a Russian tabloid, that he was not concerned about being detained while traveling abroad. \u201cI love my country. In Russia there are many beautiful places where you can go,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Burchik has worked on several small government projects in St. Petersburg. In 2015 he was awarded a contract worth about $20,000 to develop and publish a newspaper called Dvortsovy Ukrug, for the administration of one of St. Petersburg\u2019s municipal districts, according to government documents.\n\nThat same year, another municipal district government awarded him a similar contract to prepare a film about its activities. And in 2012, he won a $4,500 contract for organizing a program for promoting \u201ctolerance and prevention of drug addiction\u201d for local schools.\n\nThe Travelers: Anna V. Bogacheva and Aleksandra Y. Krylova\n\nMs. Bogacheva and Ms. Krylova obtained visas to visit the United States in 2014 \u201cunder false pretenses for the purposes of collecting intelligence to inform the organization\u2019s operatives,\u201d according to the indictment. They are said to have embarked on what amounted to a three-week reconnaissance tour, visiting California, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, New York and Texas. Along the way, they bought SIM cards, cameras and drop phones and discussed \u201cevacuation scenarios\u201d and other security measures.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She worked there from 2011 to 2014, as an engineer in the eScience Research Institute, according to a university spokeswoman. Many of the school\u2019s graduates have gone on to work for the Russian government or for large tech companies.\n\nMs. Bogacheva also owns IT Debugger, a company that says it has worked with \u201cdifficult clients.\u201d\n\nMs. Krylova became the No. 3 person at the troll farm, according to the indictment. According to what appears to be her LinkedIn profile, she is a graduate of the Moscow State University of Printing Arts, where she studied with the faculty of advertising and public relations.\n\nShe was the head of the Federal News Agency, which is believed to be Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s flagship media outlet. The agency is known for its exclusive coverage of Russian private armies on Syria\u2019s front line.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe I.T. Expert: Sergey P. Polozov\n\nMr. Polozov ran the troll farm\u2019s I.T. department and oversaw the purchase of space on computer servers inside the United States to set up virtual private networks that masked the agency\u2019s Russian location, according to the indictment. After a co-conspirator traveled to Atlanta in November 2014, he gave Mr. Polozov a summary of his trip and expenses.\n\nAccording to business records and Mr. Polozov\u2019s page on the Russian social network Vkontakte, Mr. Polozov runs a software company called Morkov, which was registered in 2013, and began to recruit web developers and programmers in early 2014.\n\n\u201cIn need of people with knowledge of website promotion for full-time work,\u201d he wrote in a Vkontakte post on May 28, 2014. \u201cIf interested, send me a personal message. You can send your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 immediately.\u201d\n\nOn Vkontakte, he shared political jokes at the expense of Russia\u2019s rivals and neighbors. One post he shared in June 2015 quoted the Chechen writer German Sadulaev:\n\nThe greatest possible mistake is to neglect the Russians. Consider them weak. Offend them. Never offend the Russians. The Russians are never as weak as you think they are. God forbid you expel the Russians or take something from them. The Russians always come back. The Russians will come back and take back what is theirs. But when the Russians return, they do not apply force proportionally. They destroy everything in their path.\n\nThe \u2018Translators\u2019: Maria A. Bovda and Robert S. Bovda\n\nNot much is known about the Bovdas, including their relationship. According to the indictment, she was the head, and he the deputy head, of the \u201ctranslator project,\u201d the troll farm\u2019s campaign to target Americans with messages on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, starting in April 2014. The project employed hundreds of people and, by the summer of 2016, was spending $1.2 million a month. It hid activities through a web of shell companies. According to the indictment, Ms. Bovda and Mr. Bovda both worked for the troll farm for about a year, from November 2013 to October 2014.\n\nThe America Specialist: Dzheykhun N. O. Aslanov\n\nAccording to the indictment, Mr. Aslanov oversaw many of the operations targeting the United States election. An investigation by RBC, a newsmagazine, found that Mr. Aslanov was in charge of the \u201cAmerican department\u201d of the troll farm. It reported that Mr. Aslanov arrived in St. Petersburg in 2000 from his hometown Ust-Kut, in the Irkutsk region. His Vkontakte profile says he graduated from the Russian State Hydrometeorological University in St. Petersburg in 2012, and a university page indicates that he studied economics and wildlife management.\n\nThe RBC report says that he spent several months in the United States in 2009, visiting New York and Boston. His work at the troll farm included registering legal entities in the names of his employees.\n\nHis name appears in public records as general director of Azimut \u2014 which, according to the indictment, was used to funnel money to the troll farm \u2014 and of the Reputation Management Center. According to its website, the Reputation Management Center first determines what kind of reputation a client has online through media monitoring, and then creates bots that improve its image through positive posts, \u201cdrowns negative reviews in a sea of favorable information about the company\u201d and \u201ccreates hype\u201d around it.\n\nThe Others: Irina V. Kaverzina, Vadim V. Podkopaev, Gleb I. Vasilchenko, Vladimir Venkov\n\nMs. Kaverzina grew worried after Facebook revealed last September that it was cooperating with the authorities to look into Russian advertising on the platform. \u201cWe had a slight crisis here at work: the F.B.I. busted our activity (not a joke),\u201d she wrote to a relative, according to the indictment. \u201cSo, I got preoccupied with covering tracks together with the colleagues,\u201d she added. \u201cI created all these pictures and posts, and the Americans believed that it was written by their people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Podkopaev was an analyst for the \u201ctranslator project.\u201d He conducted research on the United States and drafted social media messages for the organization, according to the indictment.\n\nMr. Vasilchenko posted to, monitored and updated social media accounts while posing as Americans or as American grass-roots organizations. He led two subgroups focused on political interference in the United States, including the election. On Vkontakte, he shared a meme in October 2016 that imagined a drinking game in which players took a shot every time Mr. Trump talked about building a wall along the Mexican-United States border or making America great again, told voters to believe him, or complained about being treated unfairly; and every time Mrs. Clinton coughed, sipped water, laughed awkwardly, or mentioned her daughter or President Barack Obama.\n\nMr. Venkov inhabited multiple social media personas, according to the indictment.

Tuesday was the new attendees\u2019 cocktail party, where the mood was almost effervescent, indicating that those in the psychoanalytic community don\u2019t appear to have social anxieties \u2014 or perhaps have learned to cope with them. Jamie Steele, 36, a licensed family therapist in Atlanta who sported true-to-nature-size tattoos of tulips and other flowers on both arms, said she had been working on a Ph.D. in philosophy when she was seduced by psychoanalytic theory, and pivoted.\n\nNow, she is a year into her training at Emory University Psychoanalytic Institute. \u201cI have a big interest in how technology impacts our psyche,\u201d she said, \u201chow the performance of the self creates a disconnect. Psychoanalysis speaks to us in a way that contemporary modalities and theories don\u2019t. Clinicians are seeking a different way of working with patients.\u201d\n\nMs. Freeman, of Smith, works with homeless individuals who are addicted to opioids, and she uses relational psychoanalysis with these patients (her college\u2019s curriculum, she said, is based on psychodynamic theory). \u201cMy folks aren\u2019t doing heroin because they picked it up one day,\u201d she said, referring to her patients. \u201cThere was trauma, and the drugs are just a symptom. You can\u2019t understand a person if you don\u2019t know the \u2018why.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlso in attendance that night was Stephanie Siegmund, 29, a medical student at Columbia University\u2019s Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research, where she is learning to become a better listener and a better doctor, she said.\n\nIf psychoanalysis continues to have an existential crisis \u2014 battered by managed care, challenged by short-term approaches like cognitive behavioral therapy and medication \u2014 it is a paradigm that remains dear to this group.\n\nThe American Psychoanalytic Association (known as APsaA), which was founded 107 years ago, reports that the number of candidates in psychoanalytic training at its institutes is up slightly from 5 years ago, from 794 to 827. That figure doesn\u2019t take into account candidates at the more than 50 institutes around the country that aren\u2019t under the purview of APsaA, which is affiliated with more than 30.

A traditional course of psychoanalytic treatment still means seeing a therapist several times a week for years or even decades \u2014 and yes, there are still couches. \u201cThe paradox is that in this chaotic society,\u201d Dr. Wolfe said, \u201cpsychoanalysis has never been needed so much.\u201d\n\nLast February, a group of psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers wrote a letter to The New York Times averring that President Trump was mentally unstable and that the various pathologies they had diagnosed him with made him unfit for public office. It was a refutation of the so-called Goldwater Rule, adopted by the American Psychiatric Association in 1973, which said that giving a public figure a mental diagnosis without seeing him or her was unethical.\n\nThe A.P.A., a much larger group of psychotherapists than the APsaA, struck back, maintaining its policy among its members. But Dr. Wolfe\u2019s organization issued a statement granting its own members the freedom to air their opinions, and many of them did and continue to do so.\n\nA group called A Duty to Warn has been inspired by the legal tenet that impels a therapist to break confidentiality rules if a patient is going to do damage to himself or society. \u201cThey have transported that idea from a clinical setting to the public realm,\u201d Dr. Wolfe said, \u201cto warn the American public that they have a dangerous president.\u201d As of this week, a Duty to Warn Change.org petition demanding Donald Trump\u2019s removal from the White House had over 70,000 signatures.\n\nAt the cocktail party on Tuesday, no one seemed to know the precise definition of the Goldwater Rule, but many were aware of the barrage of diagnoses that have been attached to the president, and appeared happy to contribute their own.\n\n\u201cBorderline personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder,\u201d said Ms. Freeman, cautioning that because she doesn\u2019t have her degree yet, she doesn\u2019t technically have the power to diagnose anyone.\n\nLara Weyland, 57, a practicing psychologist who is now in her second year at the San Francisco Center for Psychoanalysis, said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard him described as a malignant narcissist or an exhibiting narcissist. I wouldn\u2019t say borderline. It\u2019s a question of degrees: Malignant or exhibiting are on the extreme ends of narcissism. This is a person whose thinking is so solipsistic, they really feel quite certain that what they think is how things are. He is so unfiltered, he invites people to see him in the way a psychoanalyst would.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever,\u201d she added, \u201cI think that what he\u2019s diagnosed with is not as important as pointing out to people that it matters what people say, and we can\u2019t say he didn\u2019t mean it even though he said it.\u201d\n\nDr. Wolfe would not tender a diagnosis. \u201cI think we\u2019re well advised to be cautious about how we use diagnostic language for public figures,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it really doesn\u2019t help.

Law enforcement officials later said they had no evidence linking Mr. Cruz to extremist groups. The initial claim was traced to online forums like 4chan, where commenters appeared to gloat about deceiving journalists.\n\nMore familiar divides among the news media also emerged.\n\nThe right-leaning Breitbart.com framed coverage of the shooting as a critique of the F.B.I., which Trump supporters have frequently derided as biased against the president. Breitbart took pains to suggest a seemingly damning contrast: the F.B.I.\u2019s fumbling of a tip about the Parkland shooter and the agency\u2019s work investigating allegations of collusion between Russians and Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nS.

Proponents saw the tribunals as a means for meting out swift justice to terrorists, while human rights advocates feared that they would run roughshod over fair-trial protections.\n\nAs the years have passed, however, the focus has shifted to effectiveness. While the commissions system has achieved several convictions through plea deals, it has struggled to get contested cases to trial, and has been costing taxpayers about $100 million a year for three cases covering seven defendants. (Its third pretrial case is against an Iraqi detainee who was arraigned in 2014; he is not facing capital charges.)\n\nBy contrast, civilian court prosecutors have routinely gotten terrorism cases to trial relatively quickly and won harsh sentences. On Friday, for example, a federal judge in Brooklyn sentenced a Qaeda terrorist known as Spin Ghul to life in prison for killing two American service members in Afghanistan and for plotting to bomb an American embassy in West Africa; he was convicted last March after a civilian court trial.\n\nAccording to the transcript in the Cole case, Colonel Spath said the events that had led to its derailment \u201chave demonstrated significant flaws within the commissions process,\u201d and he accused defense lawyers of trying to block the system rather than working within it.\n\nCiting his 26 years working in the regular court-martial system, he also described himself as \u201cshaken\u201d by the experience and portrayed Mr. Nashiri\u2019s onetime defense lawyers as pursuing a \u201crevolution to the system\u201d by defying judicial orders.\n\nEarlier this week, he had weighed having United States marshals seize two of Mr. Nashiri\u2019s former lawyers \u2014 both civilian employees of the Pentagon \u2014 to force them to appear by video link from Virginia after they failed to comply with subpoenas, but decided against it.\n\nOn Friday, he argued that in his efforts to get Mr. Nashiri\u2019s defense lawyers back to work on the case, \u201cI\u2019m not ordering the Third Reich to engage in genocide \u2014 this isn\u2019t My Lai.\u201d And he said he was weighing imminent retirement.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The details remain classified, but after Colonel Spath rejected the notion that there was a problem and tried to proceed, the civilians on Mr. Nashiri\u2019s defense team quit in October, saying they had an ethical conflict.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat left only a junior, uniformed defense lawyer, Lt. Alaric Piette of the Navy. Lieutenant Piette has continued to appear in court but has not participated, arguing that he was unqualified and that the presence of a \u201clearned counsel,\u201d or death penalty specialist, is necessary \u2014 a contention Colonel Spath rejected.\n\nColonel Spath in November declared Brig. Gen. John Baker, who oversees military commissions defense lawyers, in contempt of court for refusing to order the two civilian Pentagon employees to resume work on the case. The general argued that he had the authority to dismiss them without the judge\u2019s consent \u2014 another contention Colonel Spath rejected.\n\nColonel Spath ordered General Baker confined to a trailer and fined him, but after several days, Harvey Rishikof, a former civilian Pentagon official who was then the so-called convening authority overseeing the commissions system, freed the general and overturned the fine, although he left the contempt finding in place.\n\nIn doing so, Mr. Rishikof also recommended that the military build or designate a \u201cclean\u201d facility to provide confidence that \u201cthe attorney-client meeting spaces are not subject to monitoring.\u201d (This month, Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, abruptly fired Mr. Rishikof without explanation.)\n\nOn Thursday, Colonel Spath questioned Paul S. Koffsky, a senior civilian Pentagon lawyer who oversees the office of military commissions defense lawyers. Mr. Koffsky told the judge that he only writes performance appraisals and does not tell defense lawyers what to do, and had not read the filings about the confidentiality dispute, a transcript shows.\n\n\u201cWe need action from somebody other than me, and we\u2019re not getting it,\u201d Colonel Spath said on Friday, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re going to spin our wheels and go nowhere until somebody who owns the process looks in and does something.\u201d\n\nRichard Kammen, a civilian defense lawyer who had been the death penalty specialist for Mr. Nashiri before quitting, said: \u201cWe\u2019re certainly gratified that ultimately Judge Spath reached the correct decision that the case needs to stop. This should have happened months ago.\u201d\n\nLieutenant Piette said that he expected the case to resume this year, probably without Colonel Spath as the judge. In the meantime, he said, he would try to take death penalty courses and get caught up on years of rulings in the case.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m cautiously pessimistic,\u201d he said. \u201cThings happen here that don\u2019t go on in normal courts, and this is one. A judge just called \u2018time out\u2019 for no clear legal reason.

That is the day that the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, is set to expire. The program protects about 690,000 Dreamers from deportation and allows them to work, study or join the military. But Mr. Trump rescinded DACA, leaving it to Congress to find a replacement.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the way forward is,\u201d said Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, who has for years advocated an overhaul of the United States\u2019 immigration laws.\n\nThe uncertain outlook in Congress is matched by uncertainty in the courts. Two federal courts have blocked the Trump administration from ending DACA, but the Trump administration is seeking to have those court rulings overturned. On Friday, the Supreme Court convened a closed-door conference to consider whether to bypass appellate courts and take up the issue immediately.\n\nIf that happens, legal experts say, the administration will almost certainly prevail.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves, it\u2019s looking increasingly grim,\u201d said Frank Sharry, the executive director of America\u2019s Voice, an immigrant rights group.\n\nFor his part on Friday, Mr. Trump continued to blame Democrats for the morass, although 14 Republicans voted against his plan on Thursday.\n\nImmigration has long been one of the most intractable issues in Washington. The Senate Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, had set aside this week for what was supposed to have been a freewheeling debate that would allow senators to build a bipartisan immigration bill from scratch.\n\nInstead, the debate devolved into the usual partisan bickering. The White House worked aggressively to defeat a measure backed by the Common Sense Coalition, a bipartisan group of centrists. Their measure would have offered the Dreamers a path to citizenship, while committing $25 billion for border security, including the president\u2019s proposed wall, over a 10-year period. It fell six votes short of the 60 needed to advance in the Senate.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe still have time,\u201d Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia and a chairman of the coalition. \u201cI think that the people are totally committed to it are going to want to get back together.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The president wants to severely limit family-based migration and cancel the diversity visa lottery, which aims to bring in immigrants from underrepresented countries.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats agree that there is now a very slim chance that legislation will pass offering citizenship to the Dreamers. With the Senate debate over, the White House is backing the House measure, which proposes a more far-reaching rewrite of immigration laws than even the president considered.\n\nThe House bill would require employers to use an Internet-based system, known as E-Verify, to confirm that they are hiring only legal workers; crack down on so-called sanctuary cities by denying them federal grants; allow for the detention of minors who are arrested at the border with their parents; and toughen sentences for criminals who return illegally after being deported.\n\nThe measure would end the diversity visa lottery program, as Mr. Trump wants, and end family-based migration for all relatives other than spouses and minor children. It would offer three-year renewable work permits to DACA recipients, without offering them a path to citizenship.\n\nIn the Senate, Mr. Flake is trying to gather support for a measure that would simply extend DACA by three years, without offering a path to citizenship, in exchange for three years of border-wall funding. Such a bill could be attached to the spending measure that must pass by March 23, when funding for the government runs out. Democrats might not agree to wall funding without a path to citizenship for the Dreamers. And even Mr. Flake did not sound enthusiastic about that prospect.\n\n\u201cThis is a failure of Congress to act responsibly here,\u201d he said.\n\nThe negotiations over the spending bill, which would keep the government open until the Sept. 30 end of the fiscal year, will play out in the next few weeks. But a continued impasse over immigration could again raise the threat of yet another government shutdown, on top of the two brief closures that have already occurred this year.\n\nOnce again, Democratic votes will be needed to pass the spending bill, since 60 votes are required in the Senate, where Republicans hold only 51 seats, and numerous fiscally conservative Republicans are very likely to vote against it in the House.\n\nLawmakers were already on a collision course over immigration as part of the negotiations of a long-term spending bill. Both the House and Senate plans for funding the Department of Homeland Security for the current fiscal year would provide $1.6 billion for physical barriers along the southern border with Mexico.\n\nThe wall funding is a probable flash point between the two parties, as Democrats are loath to grant Mr. Trump his wish of building it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf Congress were to approve a spending bill without wall funding, Mr. Trump could veto it.

The government designated N.R.M. as an \u201corganized criminal group\u201d in January, though it has yet to provide evidence to support the designation.\n\nThe language has escalated partly in response to a statement, released on Sunday and signed by 11 Western ambassadors, including the American ambassador, that seemed to stop just short of denouncing Mr. Odinga.\n\n\u201cA father of multiparty democracy has made unsubstantiated claims about elections and unilaterally sworn himself as \u2018president,\u2019 in deliberate disregard of the Constitution for which he so proudly fought,\u201d it said.\n\nThe statement also criticized the government for its crackdown, but opposition supporters said it came down more heavily against their leader.\n\nSenior opposition officials have distanced the coalition from the threatening language used at the news conference, and Mr. Lone said youth members were not official representatives of the coalition.\n\nBut longtime observers worry that hot-tempered supporters in the orbit of the coalition, rather than in the leadership, may ignite serious problems.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Lone appeared to acknowledge that possibility.\n\n\u201cThe longer this crisis goes on, the more people are getting radicalized \u2014 by now, we have to say have been radicalized,\u201d Mr. Lone said. \u201cThis is what Raila has been saying for months.\u201d", "keywords": ["soldiers", "political", "stalemate", "states", "target", "lone", "oppositions", "youth", "supporters", "mr", "opposition", "drags", "united", "kenya", "coalition"], "polarity": 0.06287526236389873, "subjectivity": 0.37001410205955665},

Credit Photo photo by Susan Stocker\n\nA heavily armed young man is accused of killing 17 people after opening fire on terrified students and teachers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Wednesday. It was the third mass shooting in the past four months in the United States.\n\nNikolas Cruz, who has been linked to a history of mental illness, is believed to have used a legally obtained AR-15 in the shooting. The attack has led to widespread conversations about links between gun violence and mental illness, and how lawmakers and interest groups are debating potential policy responses. Below is a look at some facts and falsehoods uttered by Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin; Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont; and others in the wake of Wednesday\u2019s shooting.\n\n\u201cMental health is often a big problem underlying these tragedies.\u201d \u2014 House Speaker Paul Ryan\n\nThere\u2019s a link, but it\u2019s more limited than widely thought.\n\nMr. Ryan\u2019s claim reflects a common misconception. According to various polls, roughly half of Americans either believe that failing to identify people with mental health problems is the primary cause of gun violence or that addressing mental health issues would be a major deterrent.\n\nThat conclusion is not shared by experts or widely accepted research.\n\nIn an analysis of 235 mass killings, many of which were carried out with firearms, 22 percent of the perpetrators could be considered mentally ill.\n\nOverall, mass shootings by people with serious mental illness represent 1 percent of all gun homicides each year, according to the book \u201cGun Violence and Mental Illness\u201d published by the American Psychiatric Association in 2016.\n\nTo be sure, gun violence experts contacted by New York Times reporters have said that barring sales to people who are deemed dangerous by mental health providers could help prevent mass shootings. But the experts said several more measures \u2014 including banning assault weapons and barring sales to convicted violent criminals \u2014 more effective.\n\nAnd, as The Times has reported, Americans do not appear to have more mental health problems than other developed nations of a comparable size, which experience far fewer mass shootings.\n\nSome further research:\n\nA 2016 academic study estimated that just 4 percent of violence is associated with serious mental illness alone. \u201cEvidence is clear that the large majority of people with mental disorders do not engage in violence against others, and that most violent behavior is due to factors other than mental illness,\u201d the study concluded.\n\nA 2015 study found that less than 5 percent of gun-related killings in the United States between 2001 and 2010 were committed by people diagnosed with mental illness.\n\nAs John T. Monahan, a professor specializing in psychology and law at the University of Virginia, told The Times:\n\n\u201cTwo things typically happen in the wake of a mass shooting. First, politicians claim that mental illness is the major cause of violence in America. Then, advocates for people with mental illness respond by denying there is any relationship whatsoever between mental illness and violence. Both groups are wrong. Research shows that the association between mental illness and violence is not strong, but it does exist.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter 18 school shootings in America in just 43 days of 2018, the Congress might want to consider common-sense gun safety legislation and save innocent lives.\u201d \u2014 Senator Bernie Sanders\n\nFalse. There have been 18 instances of weapons being discharged. It would not be fair to call them all shootings.\n\nThe figure is drawn from a list maintained by the advocacy group Every Town for Gun Safety. As the group explains on its site, the total includes \u201cany time a firearm discharges a live round inside a school building or on a school campus or grounds.\u201d\n\nAs The Washington Post, The Washington Examiner and other outlets have pointed out, that includes some incidents that most people would not consider school shootings. For example, the list includes suicides, like a Florida man who shot himself in the parking lot of a school while it was closed. And it also includes accidents like a Michigan third-grader who pulled the trigger on a police officer\u2019s holstered weapon, injuring no one.\n\n\n\n\u201cIsrael pretty much eliminated [shootings] by placing highly trained people strategically to spot the one common thread \u2014 not the weapon, but a person with intent.\u201d \u2014 Former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas\n\nThis is an interpretation that the Israelis reject.\n\nIsraeli officials and experts rejected this version of events after a similar claim was made by Wayne LaPierre, the president of the National Rifle Association, after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in which 20 children and six adults were killed.\n\n\u201cIsrael had a whole lot of school shootings until they did one thing. They said, \u2018We\u2019re going to stop it,\u2019 and they put armed security in every school, and they have not had a problem since then,\u201d Mr. LaPierre said in December 2012 on NBC.\n\nYigal Palmor, a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry, told The New York Daily News at the time that the situations in the United States and Israel were \u201cfundamentally different\u201d and said that the measures that Israel enacted were a response to terrorism.\n\n\u201cWhat removed the danger was not the armed guards, but an overall antiterror policy and antiterror operations, which brought street terrorism down to nearly zero over a number of years,\u201d Mr. Palmor said.\n\n\u201cYour very first acts as president, Mr. Trump, was to actually roll back the regulations that were designed to keep firearms out of the hands of the mentally ill.\u201d \u2014 Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel.\n\nTrue, but the rule\u2019s scope was narrow.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump focused on mental health in his national address on Thursday in response to the Parkland shooting, many journalists, activists and others, like Mr. Kimmel, noted the repeal of a rule that would have prevented \u201cseriously mentally ill\u201d people from purchasing guns.\n\nFederal law already bars anyone who \u201chas been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution\u201d from purchasing a gun. And a majority of states have laws requiring them to report mental health information to the national background check system. But gaps in the system still exist.\n\nAfter the Newtown shooting, President Obama proposed adding another data source to the background check system: reports from the Social Security Administration of people who receive disability benefits through a third party because of mental impairments. According to a 2016 White House fact sheet, the rule would have affected 75,000 people.\n\nIt was opposed by the National Rifle Association, but also the American Civil Liberties Union, which said the rule violated civil rights. Some disability rights groups also argued against the rule on the basis that it perpetuated stigmas about mental illness.\n\nMr. Trump signed a congressional resolution that expressed disapproval of the proposed rule in February 2017, nine months before compliance would have been required.\n\nLinda Qiu is a fact-check reporter, based in Washington.

Lessem, said in an interview that Mr. Pinedo had no knowledge of his clients\u2019 identities or motivations and \u201caccepted full responsibility\u201d for his actions. Mr. Pinedo had no connection to Mr. Trump, his company or his campaign, the lawyer said.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that Mr. Pinedo\u2019s actions assisted any individuals, including foreign nationals, with interfering in the American presidential election, it was done completely without his knowledge or understanding,\u201d Mr. Lessem said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a rare statement, Peter Carr, a spokesman for the special counsel, backed up that assessment. He said that prosecutors had \u201cno evidence and there is no allegation he was a witting participant in the Russian efforts to interfere in U.S. elections and political processes.\u201d\n\nA knock at the ranch-style home where Mr. Pinedo lives in suburban Santa Paula went unanswered on Friday.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Mr. Pinedo obtained thousands of bank account numbers by registering accounts in his own name or buying them in the names of others online.\n\nMany of the accounts used stolen American identities, the authorities said. Though Mr. Pinedo \u201cwas not directly involved in the registration of these accounts using stolen identities,\u201d they wrote, \u201che willfully and intentionally avoided learning about the use of stolen identities.\u201d\n\nAnd though he did not know the precise identity of his Russian clients, Mr. Pinedo \u201cfrequently\u201d bought and sold account numbers with people he knew were outside the United States, the prosecutors said.\n\nSeveral of those account numbers were ultimately sold to Russians involved in the election influence operation, the documents show. They were used by the Russians to open PayPal accounts and allowed the Russians to get around company security measures meant to verify the identity of account holders.\n\nThe PayPal accounts were then used to make purchases, including on social media accounts associated with the Internet Research Agency, the St. Petersburg-based operation at the center of the Russian disinformation campaign. In total, the Russians obtained and used 14 bank account numbers between June 2016 and March 2017. It is unclear how many were purchased from Mr. Pinedo.\n\n\u201cSome PayPal accounts were used to purchase advertisements on Facebook\u201d promoting fake social media accounts created by the Russians, the papers said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTheir goal, as has now been well documented, was to sow discord in the American political process.

(The indictment refers to campaign officials who met or communicated with Russians, but says they were \u201cunwitting.\u201d)\n\nYet Mr. Trump sidestepped the fact that he has stubbornly denied Russia\u2019s interference, even after two assessments by the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had meddled. Last November, during a trip to Asia, Mr. Trump said that Mr. Putin had told him that Russia did not meddle, and that he was inclined to believe him.\n\n\u201cEvery time he sees me he says, \u2018I didn\u2019t do that,\u2019 and I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI think he is very insulted by it,\u201d he added, \u201cwhich is not a good thing for our country.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump went so far as to suggest that the heads of the intelligence agencies at the time of the 2016 election \u2014 John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director; James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence; and James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director \u2014 were less trustworthy than Mr. Putin.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI mean, give me a break \u2014 they\u2019re political hacks,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cYou have Brennan, you have Clapper, and you have Comey.

Ryan, said. \u201cIt was a conspiracy to subvert the process, and take aim at democracy itself.\u201d\n\nThe Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, said the indictment was \u201cfurther proof that Vladimir Putin directed a campaign to interfere with our elections, with the goal of tipping the outcome.\u201d He called on Mr. Trump to immediately reverse his decision not to impose sanctions against Russia that were recently passed by Congress.\n\nRepresentative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, argued that any attempts to remove Mr. Mueller or Mr. Rosentein \u201cwill have to be seen as a direct attempt to aid the Russian government in attacking American democracy.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has not hesitated to put Mr. Mueller\u2019s future in jeopardy. Last July, he threatened to dismiss the special counsel if his investigation ranged too far afield from Russia\u2019s campaign meddling. In an interview with The New York Times, he complained that Mr. Mueller\u2019s office was rife with conflicts of interest and that the investigation had crossed a red line.\n\nA month earlier, several officials said, Mr. Trump actually gave an order to fire Mr. Mueller but backed down after Mr. McGahn threatened to resign rather than carry it out.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s strategy for dealing with charges of Russian meddling has not varied much since the campaign: deny, obfuscate, play down and, since Election Day, blame it on Democrats bitter after Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat.\n\nVideo\n\nIn May, Mr. Trump told Lester Holt, the NBC News anchor, \u201cThis Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It\u2019s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should\u2019ve won.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn September, he tweeted that \u201cthe Russia hoax continues, now it\u2019s ads on Facebook. What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?\u201d PolitiFact called Mr. Trump\u2019s denial of Russian meddling its 2017 \u201cLie of the Year.\u201d\n\nSince taking office, Mr. Trump has often expressed concern that the charges undermine the legitimacy of his presidency. He has told associates that if he accepts the premise of Russian meddling, it will call into question the idea that he won the election on his own merits.\n\nThat fear drove many of Mr. Trump\u2019s most incendiary tweets and statements throughout his first year in office, especially about the size and breadth of his electoral victory. The day after his inauguration, Mr. Trump ordered his press secretary, Sean Spicer, to insist that his inaugural crowd was the largest in history, which it demonstrably was not.\n\nIn news conferences, on Twitter and at rallies, he has called the Russia investigation \u201cfake news\u201d and repeatedly predicted that Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation will end without finding much.\n\nMr. Mueller\u2019s indictment does not settle the overarching question of whether Mr. Trump or any of his campaign associates colluded with Russia. For now, the president has seized on that as evidence of his innocence.\n\nBut as Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, put it, \u201cThe indictment leaves open the vital question of whether Americans, including any associated with the Trump campaign, knowingly played a role in Russia\u2019s active-measures campaign.\u201d\n\nThat seemed a likely avenue of inquiry for an investigation that is casting a lengthening shadow on Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.", "keywords": ["campaign", "indictment", "claim", "muellers", "sell", "mr", "russian", "russia", "investigation", "harder", "told", "york", "trump", "hoax", "trumps", "makes"], "polarity": 0.007372584976751644, "subjectivity": 0.3858453082411415},

In doing so, the Treasury Department said he provided extensive support to senior Russian Federation officials, including constructing a military base near Ukraine that was used to deploy Russian troops.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe most notorious venture linked to Mr. Prigozhin, however, is the troll farm that is accused of attacking opposition figures in Russia and seeking to magnify and aggravate social and political divisions in the West. Despite his frequent denials of any involvement, his critics say he and others like him provide a way for the Kremlin to engage in such activities while maintaining a discreet distance.\n\nThe indictment on Friday says, among other charges, that Mr. Prigozhin frequently met in 2015 and 2016 with Mikhail I. Bystrov, the top official in the troll factory, which ran a disinformation campaign called Project Lakhta that by September 2016 had a monthly budget of $1.2 million.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBoris L.

The trolls soon branched into overseas operations focused on Russian adversaries like Ukraine and the United States.\n\nFacebook, Twitter and Google have all identified the Internet Research Agency as a prime source of provocative posts on divisive American issues, including race, religion, gun laws and gay rights, particularly during the 2016 presidential election. Facebook found, for example, that the agency had posted 80,000 pieces of content that reached more than 126 million Americans.\n\nLast month, Twitter announced it had started emailing more than 677,000 people in the United States who interacted with accounts from the agency during the election.\n\nMr. Prigozhin said he was too busy to be interviewed for this article; in fact, he has given just two extended interviews in the past decade. He issued a denial of the accusations of meddling in the 2016 election, however, after a recent investigation published by the Russian newsmagazine RBC.\n\n\u201cNeither Concord Company nor other structures owned by the businessman are in any way connected with the activities directed toward meddling in the U.S. election,\u201d RBC quoted one of Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s representatives as saying.\n\nDmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, also denied any Kremlin connection to the Internet Research Agency.\n\nVideo\n\nDespite Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s veil of secrecy, limited details about his personal life have emerged, mostly through the Instagram accounts of his two grown children.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne picture featured his son, Pavel, walking naked on the deck of the 115-foot family yacht.

The compound, including a pier for the yacht, was built in an ostensibly protected forest much beloved by Mr. Putin and his cronies, according to the Anti-Corruption Foundation.\n\nThe day after researchers from the foundation leafed through the Instagram accounts and took multiple screen shots, the accounts went private. The foundation launched a drone over the sprawling family compound outside St. Petersburg to photograph what it said were father-daughter mansions and various amenities, including a full basketball court and a helicopter pad.\n\nDelovoy Peterburg, an independent daily newspaper published in St. Petersburg, listed him last year as ranking 83rd among the city\u2019s 304 ruble billionaires, with 11 billion rubles, or almost $200 million. The newspaper included only property in the public record, said Irina Pankratova, an investigative reporter. If all property linked to him had been counted, she said, he would rank in the Top 5.\n\nBorn in 1961 in what was then Leningrad, now St. Petersburg, Mr. Prigozhin showed adolescent promise as a champion cross-country skier that was cut short in 1981 by a prison sentence for robbery and other crimes, according to an extensive biography compiled by Meduza, an online investigative publication.\n\nWhen he got out after nine years, he started the hot-dog business, which led to his running a chain of convenience stores and eventually to starting several deluxe if kitschy restaurants in St. Petersburg. His patrons \u201cwanted to see something new in their lives and were tired of just eating cutlets with vodka,\u201d Mr. Prigozhin told a magazine called Elite Society.\n\nAn old rust bucket that he and his soon-to-be-jettisoned partners converted to the floating New Island Restaurant became St. Petersburg\u2019s most fashionable dining spot.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEventually, Mr. Putin himself showed up, towing world leaders. He hosted President Jacques Chirac of France and his wife in 2001 and President George W. Bush in 2002. President Putin celebrated his own birthday there in 2003.\n\nDuring these glittering occasions, Mr. Prigozhin made sure to hover nearby, sometimes even clearing empty plates.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Interpreter Newsletter Understand the world with sharp insight and commentary on the major news stories of the week.

The president \u201csaw how I built my business starting from a kiosk,\u201d Mr. Prigozhin told Gorod 812, a St. Petersburg magazine. \u201cHe saw how I was not above serving a plate.\u201d\n\nThe first significant state contracts began flowing in after Mr. Prigozhin founded Concord Catering. Starting with the St. Petersburg schools, he moved on to feeding the far more numerous Moscow schools and, finally, most of the Russian military. His trademark became lavish state banquets, including inauguration feasts for both recent presidents, Dmitri A. Medvedev and Mr. Putin.\n\nIn just the past five years, Mr. Prigozhin has received government contracts worth $3.1 billion, the Anti-Corruption Foundation reported.\n\nLately, he has branched out into areas like recruiting contract soldiers to fight overseas and establishing a popular online news service that pushes a nationalist viewpoint, making him even more indispensable to Mr. Putin.\n\nA leading news website in St. Petersburg, Fontanka, which has reported extensively on Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s military contracts, recently discovered another potential source of revenue, perhaps the biggest yet. In exchange for providing soldiers to protect Syria\u2019s oil fields, companies linked to Mr. Prigozhin were awarded a percentage of the oil revenue, the website reported.\n\nSome Russian contract soldiers in Syria were back in the news this month after a Feb. 7 clash between Kurdish forces, backed by the United States, and Syrian government forces aided by Russian mercenaries. Reports about exactly what happened remain murky, but anywhere from five to 200 Russian soldiers have been reported killed. The Russian Foreign Ministry on Thursday confirmed five deaths, but has refused to confirm that it has contract soldiers fighting in Syria, fueling anger among the families of those fighting about the lack of information.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt has always been difficult to find his fingerprints directly on any of these shadowy firms, said Denis Korotkov, a reporter for Fontanka. The only clues are the companies\u2019 overlapping ties, including the same managers, shared telephone numbers or IP addresses.\n\nAfter studying this material, Fontanka and the Anti-Corruption Foundation concluded in 2016 that significant government contracts were going to clusters of fake companies designed to circumvent federal rules on competitive bidding.\n\nState regulators also reviewed eight Defense Ministry contracts won by businesses linked to Mr. Prigozhin and issued a stern rebuke in May 2017.\n\nRussian law mandates that any contract go to the lowest bidder, but the winning tenders were only a fraction lower than the rest. Otherwise the bids were virtually identical, the Anti-Monopoly Service said, calling the 2015 bids fixed.\n\nThe government announced that it would not press charges. Nobody anticipates Mr. Prigozhin appearing in a Russian court any time soon.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect him to be punished given that he is among the president\u2019s closest friends,\u201d said Maksim L.

We go into this cleareyed that this is going to be quite a challenging election.\u201d\n\nBut Republicans have a significant structural advantage as they try to protect their one-seat majority in November: They are defending just eight seats, while Democrats have to protect 26, including those of two independents who caucus with them. Of the seats Democrats are trying to retain, 10 are in states that Mr. Trump carried in 2016.\n\nAnd after struggling to woo top-tier candidates in some states, Republicans are starting to find more success as they receive a lift from the tax overhaul they passed in December. In addition to Mr. Romney, Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, after heavy lobbying by Mr. McConnell and Mr. Trump, reversed himself and said on Friday that he would challenge Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat seeking re-election in a state that the president won by 36 points.\n\nPhoto\n\nAdvisers to Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, in an indication that he intends to challenge Senator Bill Nelson, a third-term Democrat, have moved to set up a \u201csuper PAC,\u201d according to two Republican officials. And Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, after saying he would not run again and ridiculing Mr. Trump, indicated this past week that he may not retire after all.\n\nMr. Corker\u2019s public misgivings, however, have complicated the Tennessee race, where Representative Marsha Blackburn, a staunch conservative, was already lining up support, and where Democrats landed a formidable candidate, former Gov. Phil Bredesen.\n\nMr. McConnell, who is close to Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, an ally of Mr. Corker, was guarded in his comments about the election, but he chuckled when pressed on the incumbent\u2019s apparent change of heart.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt does underscore that people want to be in the Senate,\u201d he said, trying to make the best of what could become a messy primary contest. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a different environment from late summer, early fall,\u201d when the Republicans were stung by their failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nEqually delicate is the fate of Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi, who at 80 has had a series of health problems and whose seat is being eyed by a hard-line state senator, Chris McDaniel, who nearly beat him in a bitter 2014 primary race.\n\nMr. McConnell called it \u201cpremature\u201d to assess the prospect of a special election this year to replace Mr. Cochran, but did acknowledge that \u201cthere could be\u201d one. \u201cIt\u2019s up to Senator Cochran to make that decision,\u201d he said.\n\nPrivately, though, Republicans are already scrambling to protect Mr. Cochran\u2019s seat. Party leaders fear that a candidacy by Mr. McDaniel could create a competitive race, and perhaps even spiral into a debacle similar to what happened in Alabama last year, when Roy S.

Republicans close to Mr. Cochran, who is the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, say that while he is not ruling out stepping down this year, he will not contemplate quitting until Congress finishes its 2018 spending bill next month.\n\nMore broadly, Mr. McConnell said he was open to intervening in some party primary contests, as he did in the Tea Party era, but would do so on a state-by-state basis.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe made clear he was supporting Representative Martha McSally of Arizona, who is running against a pair of immigration hawks to replace Senator Jeff Flake. And he said he did not want to see Don Blankenship, the former coal mine owner imprisoned for violating federal mine safety standards, become the party\u2019s standard-bearer against Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia.\n\nMr. McConnell harshly criticized a series of red-state Democrats, but took repeated aim at Mr. Manchin, with whom he has tangled in the past and is plainly eager to beat in a state that has otherwise embraced the Republican Party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cJoe thinks he can just kind of talk his way through all of this, but talk is really cheap when your record doesn\u2019t meet the rhetoric,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, noting Mr. Manchin\u2019s opposition to a series of Republican measures, including the tax bill.\n\nMr. McConnell acknowledged that some of his candidates were struggling to raise money \u2014 \u201cI concede the fund-raising problem,\u201d he said. But he said it was largely the result of having to face so many incumbents, who are typically better able to draw donors.\n\nStill, he said that a Supreme Court case, scheduled to be argued on Feb. 26, that is expected to curb the ability of public sector unions to automatically deduct dues from their members could have an impact on Democratic fund-raising.\n\nHe called the case \u201can example\u201d of why he had found it so important to block former President Barack Obama from replacing Antonin Scalia on the court after his death in 2016, a move that Democrats remain bitter about.\n\nAnd, without being prompted, Mr. McConnell said he hoped that the court would broadly address what he described as the left\u2019s effort to outlaw gerrymandering.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think the founding fathers had in mind when they gave it to the state legislatures?\u201d he said of redistricting powers. \u201cThey thought it was going to be a political exercise.\u201d\n\nWhile eager to trumpet the tax measure, Mr. McConnell said that \u201cthe single best thing we\u2019ve done, in conjunction with the administration, are the court appointments,\u201d including that of Neil M.

The company\u2019s business depends on people being highly engaged with what is posted on its sites, which in turn helps make it a marquee destination for advertisers.\n\nWhen suggestions first arose after the 2016 election that Facebook may have influenced the outcome, Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, dismissed the concerns. But by last September, Facebook had disclosed that the Internet Research Agency had bought divisive ads on hot-button issues through the company. It later said 150 million Americans had seen the Russian propaganda on the social network and Instagram.\n\nThe resulting firestorm has damaged Facebook\u2019s reputation. Company officials, along with executives from Google and YouTube, were grilled by lawmakers last fall. Facebook has since hired thousands of people to help monitor content and has worked with Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel leading the investigation into Russian election interference. It has also changed its advertising policy so that any ad that mentions a candidate\u2019s name goes through a more stringent vetting process. Mr. Zuckerberg has vowed to not let Facebook be abused by bad actors.\n\nYet Facebook\u2019s multiple mentions in Friday\u2019s indictment renew questions of why the world\u2019s biggest social media company didn\u2019t catch the Russian activity earlier or do more to stop it. How effective the company\u2019s new efforts to reduce foreign manipulation have been is also unclear.\n\nRob Goldman, Facebook\u2019s vice president of advertising, waded into the discussion on Friday with a series of tweets that argued that Russia\u2019s goal was to sow chaos among the electorate rather than to force a certain outcome in the election. On Saturday, President Trump cited those tweets as evidence that Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign was not aimed at handing him a victory.\n\nIn Silicon Valley, where Facebook has its headquarters, some critics pilloried the company after the indictment became public.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

Facebook does just the opposite, enabling every user to have a unique set of facts, driving the country apart for profit.\u201d\n\nJoel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global policy, said in a statement that the company was grateful the government was taking action \u201cagainst those who abused our service and exploited the openness of our democratic process.\u201d\n\nHe added that Facebook was working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation ahead of this year\u2019s midterm elections to ensure that a similar manipulation campaign would not take place. \u201cWe know we have more to do to prevent against future attacks,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook has previously questioned whether law enforcement should be more involved in helping to stop the threat from nation state actors. Facebook said it worked closely with the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\n\nYouTube did not respond to a request for comment, while Twitter declined to comment. PayPal said in a statement that it has worked closely with law enforcement and \u201cis intensely focused on combating and preventing the illicit use of our services.\u201d\n\nAccording to the indictment, the Internet Research Agency, created in 2014 in St. Petersburg and employing about 80 people, was given the job of interfering with elections and political processes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe group began using American social media to achieve those aims in 2014, when it started making Facebook pages dedicated to social issues like race and religion. Over the next two years, the indictment said, the Russians stole the identities of real Americans to create fake personas and fake accounts on social media. The group then used those to populate and promote Facebook pages like United Muslims of America, Blacktivist and Secured Borders.\n\nPhoto\n\nBy 2016, the indictment said, the size of some of these Russian-controlled Facebook groups had ballooned to hundreds of thousands of followers.\n\nThe Russians then used these groups to push various messages, including telling Americans not to vote in the 2016 election for either Mr. Trump or his opponent, Hillary Clinton. In October 2016, according to the indictment, one Russian-controlled Instagram account called Woke Blacks posted a message saying: \u201cHatred for Trump is misleading the people and forcing Blacks to vote Killary. We cannot resort to the lesser of two devils. Then we\u2019d surely be better off without voting AT ALL.\u201d\n\nAround 2015, according to the indictment, the Russians also started purchasing ads on Facebook and other social media sites like Twitter, targeting specific communities within the United States. The group used stolen PayPal accounts to pay for the ads and to promote posts, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on the outreach.\n\nIn one ad, published to promote a Facebook event called \u201cDown with Hillary,\u201d an image of Mrs. Clinton was shown with a black \u201cX\u201d painted across her face. The text read, \u201cHillary Clinton is the co-author of Obama\u2019s anti-police and anti-Constitutional propaganda.\u201d\n\nBy mid-2016, according to the indictment, the Russians were using their fake Facebook personas to organize political rallies in the United States. That June, for example, posing as the United Muslims of America on Facebook, they promoted a rally called \u201cSupport Hillary. Save American Muslims.\u201d For an August 2016 event organized through Facebook, the Russians also paid for a cage to be built that was large enough to hold an actress depicting Mrs. Clinton in a prison uniform.\n\nAt every step, the Russians used Facebook\u2019s own tools to make sure their propaganda was as effective as possible. Those tools allowed them to get real-time results on which types of ad campaigns were reaching their target audience or which posts were getting the most engagement with viewers.\n\nResearchers said that those tools are still widely available and that while the company has worked to remove fake accounts and stem the flow of disinformation, it has refused to let outside researchers examine the data on how Russian actors used the platform so effectively.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking steps to fix this, but there\u2019s no easy solution,\u201d Anton Vuljaj, a Republican media strategist who has advised campaigns and media groups, said of Facebook and other social media companies. \u201cThis also shows that the public needs to be more vigilant about what is real and what is not online.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["discord", "russians", "media", "indictment", "company", "russian", "stir", "social", "used", "turned", "facebook", "tools", "2016"], "polarity": 0.10541565656565653, "subjectivity": 0.36454033189033197},

The Americans argued they were just matching Russian capabilities and charged that Moscow was in continued violation of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces agreement, limiting tactical weapons.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet the cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and others, and the use of Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms to spread propaganda, dominated the discussion and reflected how quickly the use of these techniques has become the new battleground in a very different kind of post-Cold War conflict.\n\nThe White House cybercoordinator, Rob Joyce, was particularly direct in his accusations that Russia was behind the broad attack on Ukraine last June, called \u201cNotPetya.\u201d He described the attack as \u201cindiscriminate\u201d and noted that it paralyzed operations far beyond Ukraine, the intended target, and included the Maersk shipping system. He said the United States would retaliate, but did not say how, adding \u201cwe will not telegraph these punches.\u201d\n\nMr. Joyce is no newcomer to offensive cyberoperations; previously he ran the Tailored Access Operations unit of the National Security Agency, overseeing American cyberaction against other counties. \u201cWe are going to conduct cyberoperations,\u201d he said.

He did not mention that the administration has yet to impose those sanctions, saying the threat of them alone has begun to change Russian behavior.\n\n\u201cThat sanctions bill has not yet been used as a tool against the Russians,\u201d Christopher Painter, a former coordinator for cyberissues at the State Department, who also attended the conference. \u201cThe question now is whether they will actually use it to create consequences.

Cities like Chicago and Baltimore, with rigorous gun laws, also have two of the highest murder rates in the country. The black market for illegal guns has thrived in those cities, with gang members and criminals turning to the streets to get firearms.\n\nAnd the drop in fatal shootings in Connecticut has occurred in the context of a broad, long-term decline in violent crime across the country. Citing F.B.I. statistics, the Pew Research Center reports that violent crime fell 48 percent from 1993 to 2016.\n\nGun-rights groups say the problem is not the guns, but the individuals using them. They argue that laws alone are no panacea, and that social issues like mental illness and unemployment must be addressed to help curb gun violence. Some gun advocates have also called for more training and security for those who legally and responsibly maintain guns.\n\nStill, with little appetite in Congress to take on gun control, the debate is playing out at the state level, with Connecticut seen as a model for gun-control advocates.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cConnecticut\u2019s laws are among the nation\u2019s toughest and homicides are down,\u201d Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said. \u201cObviously the link is a circumstantial one; cause and effect can\u2019t be proven conclusively. But the numbers are all in the right direction. States like Connecticut can help shame Congress into adopting common-sense measures that keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people.\u201d\n\nState officials say Connecticut has experienced the fastest drop in violent crime of any state over the last four years. Gun-control advocates say the suspect in Florida, Nikolas Cruz, could not have bought the AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle believed used in the attack, or the high-capacity magazines, in Connecticut.\n\n\u201cWe really need to do a better job at making sure we have strong gun laws in every state in the country, because we are losing our most valuable resource, which is our children,\u201d said Jeremy I. Stein, the executive director of CT Against Gun Violence, a nonprofit advocacy group.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven in Connecticut, where parents of the children killed at Sandy Hook met with lawmakers as they debated the legislation, the measures fell short of what gun-control advocates wanted. For example, the laws did not force residents to relinquish existing assault weapons and high-capacity magazines or limit the number of firearms people could own.\n\nAt a hearing a month after the Newtown shooting, some speakers talked of the need to hold people accountable. \u201cThe problem is not gun laws. The problem is a lack of civility,\u201d said Mark Mattioli, whose son James, 6, was killed at Sandy Hook Elementary.\n\nThe Giffords Center, which keeps a state-by-state report card, gave Connecticut an A-minus for its gun laws \u2014 the same grade given to New York, which moved even more swiftly after Sandy Hook to pass stricter laws. The center ranked Connecticut 46th and New York 48th for their gun death rates, among the five lowest in the United States.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The New York law not only bans the sale of assault weapons and imposes universal background checks, it also prohibits both the sale \u2014 and possession \u2014 of magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds. And it requires mental health professionals to alert the authorities about at-risk patients who should not be allowed to buy a firearm. As of Feb. 8, 77,447 people deemed to be dangerously mentally ill had been added to the database.\n\nAvery W. Gardiner, a president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said that generally, blue states are, not surprisingly, more likely to regulate guns and require background checks and licensing. Conservative red states either lack gun-safety laws or fail to enforce the ones they have. Her group\u2019s strategy includes filing lawsuits to enforce existing safety laws and countering the gun lobby, which uses its muscle in statehouses as well as Congress.\n\nThe lobbying has been hard on both sides. According to the nonpartisan National Institute on Money in State Politics, in the past three election cycles the National Rifle Association, the nation\u2019s leading gun lobby, spent a total of $10.6 million to support candidates for state office in 25 states. Between 2009 and 2016, at least two-thirds of that spending went to state contests in which the group\u2019s chosen candidate won.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cFlorida has gone the wrong way since Sandy Hook for sensible laws,\u201d Ms. Gardiner said, citing a Florida law that would have restricted doctors from even asking patients about gun safety. The Brady Center sued Florida on the grounds that the law violated the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of free speech, and a year ago a panel of federal judges ruled in the center\u2019s favor.\n\nIn Connecticut, the question of magazine capacity became emotionally charged as the stricter gun laws were being debated. That is because the Sandy Hook attacker, Adam Lanza, like other mass gunmen, used high-capacity magazines that allowed him to rapidly fire 30 rounds. A group of first graders at Sandy Hook ran past Mr. Lanza, escaping from the hail of bullets when he had to stop and reload.\n\nAt a news conference in April 2013, on the day lawmakers announced an agreement on gun control, Nicole Hockley, whose son, Dylan, died at Sandy Hook, said: \u201cWe ask ourselves every day \u2014 every minute \u2014 if those magazines had held 10 rounds, forcing the shooter to reload at least six more times, would our children be alive today?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nConnecticut\u2019s sweeping gun laws did, however, require residents who already owned high-capacity magazines and assault rifles to register them with the State Police. Today, the registry lists 52,648 assault weapons. A single resident registered 179 assault weapons, while another registered more than 500,000 magazines exceeding the 10-round limit. Between 2013 and 2017, 248 people were charged with illegally possessing an assault weapon because they either failed to register an existing weapon or had bought a weapon after the law went into effect.\n\nThe state also requires that individuals admitted to psychiatric hospitals relinquish their guns, at least temporarily. The State Police is notified of such patients by the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, which maintains a database, and ensures that upon discharge, the gun owner turns in the weapon or transfers it to someone eligible for a gun permit. In addition, people who were previously treated in a mental hospital cannot get a permit for up to two years afterward.\n\nThe National Shooting Sports Foundation, a lobby group in Newtown, Conn., declined to comment on the impact of Connecticut\u2019s gun laws \u201cout of respect for the families, the community and the ongoing law enforcement investigation\u201d in Parkland, Fla. The National Rifle Association did not respond to a request to comment.\n\nConnecticut is also one of a few states with another gun law with some teeth \u2014 an \u201cextreme risk protection order.\u201d Akin to a restraining order for domestic violence victims, the protection order, which predates Sandy Hook, gives the police the power to temporarily take away an individual\u2019s guns if a person makes threats, acts violently, abuses drugs or commits animal cruelty.\n\nIn the Florida massacre, the authorities believe that the gunman may have made threatening comments on social media, including one last September \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m going to be a professional school shooter\u201d \u2014 and had also posted a photo of a bloodied frog.\n\nA study that examined Connecticut\u2019s risk protection order found that, from 1999 to 2013, 99 percent of warrants led to the confiscation of at least one gun. In nearly half the cases, the gun owner wound up receiving psychiatric treatment.\n\nMike Lawlor, the criminal justice adviser to Governor Malloy, said that the law arose from two high-profile shootings in the 1990s by people with severe mental health issues. \u201cWhen there\u2019s no law that\u2019s actually been broken, but when there is real evidence that the person is a danger to others, the police need to have an option,\u201d he said. \u201cStep one is to get the guns.\u201d", "keywords": ["advocates", "magazines", "laws", "florida", "sandy", "law", "hook", "look", "connecticut", "york", "guns", "guncontrol", "gun", "wake", "state", "massacre"], "polarity": -0.025332773802161566, "subjectivity": 0.4034589701681538},

Bystrov\n\nMr. Bystrov is a retired St. Petersburg police colonel who, according to the indictment, joined the company in February 2014 and became its highest-ranking official. He also led shell entities that were used to conceal its activities, including one called Glavset, a so-called database and information company. It shared an address \u2014 55 Savushkina Street \u2014 with the Internet Research Agency. (The troll farm has since moved to Optikov Street, according to the local press.)\n\n\n\nThe troll farm soon drew notice in Russia: news outlets reported that it employed 250 people in 12-hour shifts to provide a round-the-clock flow of pro-Kremlin posts and comments, praising Mr. Putin and excoriating President Barack Obama and President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine. Monthly salaries ranged from $1,100 for a junior analyst to $1,400 for a blogger to $4,200 a month for senior management.\n\nMr. Bystrov, who is believed to be 59, has avoided reporters and declined interview requests.\n\nThe Executive Director: Mikhail L. Burchik\n\nPhoto\n\nA young tech entrepreneur, Mr. Burchik, 31, joined the company in October 2013 and became its executive director, the No. 2 official, by March 2014, according to the indictment.\n\nAccording to online records, he registered a company in 2009 called Add1.ru that was behind a 2014 hoax. In that hoax, a young woman in aviator sunglasses calling herself Zoe Foreman spent hours spamming politicians and journalists about a horrific \u2014 and fictitious \u2014 chemical plant explosion in Louisiana.\n\n\u201cI have heard of it, but I don\u2019t work in this organization,\u201d he told the journalist Adrian Chen, who wrote about the troll farm in 2015 for The New York Times Magazine.

In Russia there are many beautiful places where you can go,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Burchik has worked on several small government projects in St. Petersburg. In 2015 he was awarded a contract worth about $20,000 to develop and publish a newspaper called Dvortsovy Ukrug, for the administration of one of St. Petersburg\u2019s municipal districts, according to government documents.\n\nThat same year, another municipal district government awarded him a similar contract to prepare a film about its activities. And in 2012, he won a $4,500 contract for organizing a program for promoting \u201ctolerance and prevention of drug addiction\u201d for local schools.\n\nThe Travelers: Anna V.

After a co-conspirator traveled to Atlanta in November 2014, he gave Mr. Polozov a summary of his trip and expenses.\n\nAccording to business records and Mr. Polozov\u2019s page on the Russian social network Vkontakte, Mr. Polozov runs a software company called Morkov, which was registered in 2013, and began to recruit web developers and programmers in early 2014.\n\n\u201cIn need of people with knowledge of website promotion for full-time work,\u201d he wrote in a Vkontakte post on May 28, 2014. \u201cIf interested, send me a personal message.

The Russians are never as weak as you think they are. God forbid you expel the Russians or take something from them. The Russians always come back. The Russians will come back and take back what is theirs. But when the Russians return, they do not apply force proportionally. They destroy everything in their path.\n\nThe \u2018Translators\u2019: Maria A. Bovda and Robert S. Bovda\n\nNot much is known about the Bovdas, including their relationship. According to the indictment, she was the head, and he the deputy head, of the \u201ctranslator project,\u201d the troll farm\u2019s campaign to target Americans with messages on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, starting in April 2014. The project employed hundreds of people and, by the summer of 2016, was spending $1.2 million a month. It hid activities through a web of shell companies. According to the indictment, Ms. Bovda and Mr. Bovda both worked for the troll farm for about a year, from November 2013 to October 2014.\n\nThe America Specialist: Dzheykhun N. O. Aslanov\n\nAccording to the indictment, Mr. Aslanov oversaw many of the operations targeting the United States election. An investigation by RBC, a newsmagazine, found that Mr. Aslanov was in charge of the \u201cAmerican department\u201d of the troll farm. It reported that Mr. Aslanov arrived in St. Petersburg in 2000 from his hometown Ust-Kut, in the Irkutsk region. His Vkontakte profile says he graduated from the Russian State Hydrometeorological University in St. Petersburg in 2012, and a university page indicates that he studied economics and wildlife management.\n\nThe RBC report says that he spent several months in the United States in 2009, visiting New York and Boston. His work at the troll farm included registering legal entities in the names of his employees.\n\nHis name appears in public records as general director of Azimut \u2014 which, according to the indictment, was used to funnel money to the troll farm \u2014 and of the Reputation Management Center. According to its website, the Reputation Management Center first determines what kind of reputation a client has online through media monitoring, and then creates bots that improve its image through positive posts, \u201cdrowns negative reviews in a sea of favorable information about the company\u201d and \u201ccreates hype\u201d around it.\n\nThe Others: Irina V. Kaverzina, Vadim V. Podkopaev, Gleb I. Vasilchenko, Vladimir Venkov\n\nMs. Kaverzina grew worried after Facebook revealed last September that it was cooperating with the authorities to look into Russian advertising on the platform. \u201cWe had a slight crisis here at work: the F.B.I. busted our activity (not a joke),\u201d she wrote to a relative, according to the indictment. \u201cSo, I got preoccupied with covering tracks together with the colleagues,\u201d she added. \u201cI created all these pictures and posts, and the Americans believed that it was written by their people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Podkopaev was an analyst for the \u201ctranslator project.\u201d He conducted research on the United States and drafted social media messages for the organization, according to the indictment.\n\nMr. Vasilchenko posted to, monitored and updated social media accounts while posing as Americans or as American grass-roots organizations. He led two subgroups focused on political interference in the United States, including the election. On Vkontakte, he shared a meme in October 2016 that imagined a drinking game in which players took a shot every time Mr. Trump talked about building a wall along the Mexican-United States border or making America great again, told voters to believe him, or complained about being treated unfairly; and every time Mrs. Clinton coughed, sipped water, laughed awkwardly, or mentioned her daughter or President Barack Obama.\n\nMr. Venkov inhabited multiple social media personas, according to the indictment.

Jamie Steele, 36, a licensed family therapist in Atlanta who sported true-to-nature-size tattoos of tulips and other flowers on both arms, said she had been working on a Ph.D. in philosophy when she was seduced by psychoanalytic theory, and pivoted.\n\nNow, she is a year into her training at Emory University Psychoanalytic Institute. \u201cI have a big interest in how technology impacts our psyche,\u201d she said, \u201chow the performance of the self creates a disconnect. Psychoanalysis speaks to us in a way that contemporary modalities and theories don\u2019t. Clinicians are seeking a different way of working with patients.\u201d\n\nMs. Freeman, of Smith, works with homeless individuals who are addicted to opioids, and she uses relational psychoanalysis with these patients (her college\u2019s curriculum, she said, is based on psychodynamic theory). \u201cMy folks aren\u2019t doing heroin because they picked it up one day,\u201d she said, referring to her patients. \u201cThere was trauma, and the drugs are just a symptom. You can\u2019t understand a person if you don\u2019t know the \u2018why.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlso in attendance that night was Stephanie Siegmund, 29, a medical student at Columbia University\u2019s Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research, where she is learning to become a better listener and a better doctor, she said.\n\nIf psychoanalysis continues to have an existential crisis \u2014 battered by managed care, challenged by short-term approaches like cognitive behavioral therapy and medication \u2014 it is a paradigm that remains dear to this group.\n\nThe American Psychoanalytic Association (known as APsaA), which was founded 107 years ago, reports that the number of candidates in psychoanalytic training at its institutes is up slightly from 5 years ago, from 794 to 827. That figure doesn\u2019t take into account candidates at the more than 50 institutes around the country that aren\u2019t under the purview of APsaA, which is affiliated with more than 30.

A traditional course of psychoanalytic treatment still means seeing a therapist several times a week for years or even decades \u2014 and yes, there are still couches. \u201cThe paradox is that in this chaotic society,\u201d Dr. Wolfe said, \u201cpsychoanalysis has never been needed so much.\u201d\n\nLast February, a group of psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers wrote a letter to The New York Times averring that President Trump was mentally unstable and that the various pathologies they had diagnosed him with made him unfit for public office. It was a refutation of the so-called Goldwater Rule, adopted by the American Psychiatric Association in 1973, which said that giving a public figure a mental diagnosis without seeing him or her was unethical.\n\nThe A.P.A., a much larger group of psychotherapists than the APsaA, struck back, maintaining its policy among its members. But Dr. Wolfe\u2019s organization issued a statement granting its own members the freedom to air their opinions, and many of them did and continue to do so.\n\nA group called A Duty to Warn has been inspired by the legal tenet that impels a therapist to break confidentiality rules if a patient is going to do damage to himself or society. \u201cThey have transported that idea from a clinical setting to the public realm,\u201d Dr. Wolfe said, \u201cto warn the American public that they have a dangerous president.\u201d As of this week, a Duty to Warn Change.org petition demanding Donald Trump\u2019s removal from the White House had over 70,000 signatures.\n\nAt the cocktail party on Tuesday, no one seemed to know the precise definition of the Goldwater Rule, but many were aware of the barrage of diagnoses that have been attached to the president, and appeared happy to contribute their own.\n\n\u201cBorderline personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder,\u201d said Ms. Freeman, cautioning that because she doesn\u2019t have her degree yet, she doesn\u2019t technically have the power to diagnose anyone.\n\nLara Weyland, 57, a practicing psychologist who is now in her second year at the San Francisco Center for Psychoanalysis, said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard him described as a malignant narcissist or an exhibiting narcissist. I wouldn\u2019t say borderline. It\u2019s a question of degrees: Malignant or exhibiting are on the extreme ends of narcissism. This is a person whose thinking is so solipsistic, they really feel quite certain that what they think is how things are.

Law enforcement officials later said they had no evidence linking Mr. Cruz to extremist groups. The initial claim was traced to online forums like 4chan, where commenters appeared to gloat about deceiving journalists.\n\nMore familiar divides among the news media also emerged.\n\nThe right-leaning Breitbart.com framed coverage of the shooting as a critique of the F.B.I., which Trump supporters have frequently derided as biased against the president. Breitbart took pains to suggest a seemingly damning contrast: the F.B.I.\u2019s fumbling of a tip about the Parkland shooter and the agency\u2019s work investigating allegations of collusion between Russians and Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nS.

Proponents saw the tribunals as a means for meting out swift justice to terrorists, while human rights advocates feared that they would run roughshod over fair-trial protections.\n\nAs the years have passed, however, the focus has shifted to effectiveness. While the commissions system has achieved several convictions through plea deals, it has struggled to get contested cases to trial, and has been costing taxpayers about $100 million a year for three cases covering seven defendants. (Its third pretrial case is against an Iraqi detainee who was arraigned in 2014; he is not facing capital charges.)\n\nBy contrast, civilian court prosecutors have routinely gotten terrorism cases to trial relatively quickly and won harsh sentences. On Friday, for example, a federal judge in Brooklyn sentenced a Qaeda terrorist known as Spin Ghul to life in prison for killing two American service members in Afghanistan and for plotting to bomb an American embassy in West Africa; he was convicted last March after a civilian court trial.\n\nAccording to the transcript in the Cole case, Colonel Spath said the events that had led to its derailment \u201chave demonstrated significant flaws within the commissions process,\u201d and he accused defense lawyers of trying to block the system rather than working within it.\n\nCiting his 26 years working in the regular court-martial system, he also described himself as \u201cshaken\u201d by the experience and portrayed Mr. Nashiri\u2019s onetime defense lawyers as pursuing a \u201crevolution to the system\u201d by defying judicial orders.\n\nEarlier this week, he had weighed having United States marshals seize two of Mr. Nashiri\u2019s former lawyers \u2014 both civilian employees of the Pentagon \u2014 to force them to appear by video link from Virginia after they failed to comply with subpoenas, but decided against it.\n\nOn Friday, he argued that in his efforts to get Mr. Nashiri\u2019s defense lawyers back to work on the case, \u201cI\u2019m not ordering the Third Reich to engage in genocide \u2014 this isn\u2019t My Lai.\u201d And he said he was weighing imminent retirement.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The details remain classified, but after Colonel Spath rejected the notion that there was a problem and tried to proceed, the civilians on Mr. Nashiri\u2019s defense team quit in October, saying they had an ethical conflict.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat left only a junior, uniformed defense lawyer, Lt. Alaric Piette of the Navy. Lieutenant Piette has continued to appear in court but has not participated, arguing that he was unqualified and that the presence of a \u201clearned counsel,\u201d or death penalty specialist, is necessary \u2014 a contention Colonel Spath rejected.\n\nColonel Spath in November declared Brig. Gen. John Baker, who oversees military commissions defense lawyers, in contempt of court for refusing to order the two civilian Pentagon employees to resume work on the case. The general argued that he had the authority to dismiss them without the judge\u2019s consent \u2014 another contention Colonel Spath rejected.\n\nColonel Spath ordered General Baker confined to a trailer and fined him, but after several days, Harvey Rishikof, a former civilian Pentagon official who was then the so-called convening authority overseeing the commissions system, freed the general and overturned the fine, although he left the contempt finding in place.\n\nIn doing so, Mr. Rishikof also recommended that the military build or designate a \u201cclean\u201d facility to provide confidence that \u201cthe attorney-client meeting spaces are not subject to monitoring.\u201d (This month, Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, abruptly fired Mr. Rishikof without explanation.)\n\nOn Thursday, Colonel Spath questioned Paul S. Koffsky, a senior civilian Pentagon lawyer who oversees the office of military commissions defense lawyers. Mr. Koffsky told the judge that he only writes performance appraisals and does not tell defense lawyers what to do, and had not read the filings about the confidentiality dispute, a transcript shows.\n\n\u201cWe need action from somebody other than me, and we\u2019re not getting it,\u201d Colonel Spath said on Friday, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re going to spin our wheels and go nowhere until somebody who owns the process looks in and does something.\u201d\n\nRichard Kammen, a civilian defense lawyer who had been the death penalty specialist for Mr. Nashiri before quitting, said: \u201cWe\u2019re certainly gratified that ultimately Judge Spath reached the correct decision that the case needs to stop. This should have happened months ago.\u201d\n\nLieutenant Piette said that he expected the case to resume this year, probably without Colonel Spath as the judge. In the meantime, he said, he would try to take death penalty courses and get caught up on years of rulings in the case.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m cautiously pessimistic,\u201d he said. \u201cThings happen here that don\u2019t go on in normal courts, and this is one.

That is the day that the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, is set to expire. The program protects about 690,000 Dreamers from deportation and allows them to work, study or join the military. But Mr. Trump rescinded DACA, leaving it to Congress to find a replacement.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the way forward is,\u201d said Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, who has for years advocated an overhaul of the United States\u2019 immigration laws.\n\nThe uncertain outlook in Congress is matched by uncertainty in the courts. Two federal courts have blocked the Trump administration from ending DACA, but the Trump administration is seeking to have those court rulings overturned. On Friday, the Supreme Court convened a closed-door conference to consider whether to bypass appellate courts and take up the issue immediately.\n\nIf that happens, legal experts say, the administration will almost certainly prevail.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves, it\u2019s looking increasingly grim,\u201d said Frank Sharry, the executive director of America\u2019s Voice, an immigrant rights group.\n\nFor his part on Friday, Mr. Trump continued to blame Democrats for the morass, although 14 Republicans voted against his plan on Thursday.\n\nImmigration has long been one of the most intractable issues in Washington. The Senate Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, had set aside this week for what was supposed to have been a freewheeling debate that would allow senators to build a bipartisan immigration bill from scratch.\n\nInstead, the debate devolved into the usual partisan bickering. The White House worked aggressively to defeat a measure backed by the Common Sense Coalition, a bipartisan group of centrists. Their measure would have offered the Dreamers a path to citizenship, while committing $25 billion for border security, including the president\u2019s proposed wall, over a 10-year period.

The president wants to severely limit family-based migration and cancel the diversity visa lottery, which aims to bring in immigrants from underrepresented countries.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats agree that there is now a very slim chance that legislation will pass offering citizenship to the Dreamers. With the Senate debate over, the White House is backing the House measure, which proposes a more far-reaching rewrite of immigration laws than even the president considered.\n\nThe House bill would require employers to use an Internet-based system, known as E-Verify, to confirm that they are hiring only legal workers; crack down on so-called sanctuary cities by denying them federal grants; allow for the detention of minors who are arrested at the border with their parents; and toughen sentences for criminals who return illegally after being deported.\n\nThe measure would end the diversity visa lottery program, as Mr. Trump wants, and end family-based migration for all relatives other than spouses and minor children. It would offer three-year renewable work permits to DACA recipients, without offering them a path to citizenship.\n\nIn the Senate, Mr. Flake is trying to gather support for a measure that would simply extend DACA by three years, without offering a path to citizenship, in exchange for three years of border-wall funding. Such a bill could be attached to the spending measure that must pass by March 23, when funding for the government runs out. Democrats might not agree to wall funding without a path to citizenship for the Dreamers. And even Mr. Flake did not sound enthusiastic about that prospect.\n\n\u201cThis is a failure of Congress to act responsibly here,\u201d he said.\n\nThe negotiations over the spending bill, which would keep the government open until the Sept. 30 end of the fiscal year, will play out in the next few weeks. But a continued impasse over immigration could again raise the threat of yet another government shutdown, on top of the two brief closures that have already occurred this year.\n\nOnce again, Democratic votes will be needed to pass the spending bill, since 60 votes are required in the Senate, where Republicans hold only 51 seats, and numerous fiscally conservative Republicans are very likely to vote against it in the House.\n\nLawmakers were already on a collision course over immigration as part of the negotiations of a long-term spending bill. Both the House and Senate plans for funding the Department of Homeland Security for the current fiscal year would provide $1.6 billion for physical barriers along the southern border with Mexico.\n\nThe wall funding is a probable flash point between the two parties, as Democrats are loath to grant Mr. Trump his wish of building it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf Congress were to approve a spending bill without wall funding, Mr. Trump could veto it.

The memo does not do that.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Mr. Kelly\u2019s pledge of action comes after bipartisan pressure from lawmakers on Capitol Hill, who have in recent days demanded that the White House account for Mr. Porter\u2019s case and the broader issue of people without permanent security clearances working at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\n\u201cThe committee is investigating the policies and processes by which interim security clearances are investigated and adjudicated within the executive branch,\u201d Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, wrote this week.\n\nMr. Kelly said that he was putting into effect changes that would address a failure of communication between the F.B.I. and senior officials in the West Wing \u2014 exactly the kind of failure that White House officials have said was responsible in Mr. Porter\u2019s case.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

McGahn II, any concerns that they uncovered during the background investigations of the president\u2019s top aides.\n\nMr. Kelly said that would ensure that \u201ccritical material will be differentiated from the ordinary volume of communications and delivered quickly and directly to the appropriate person rather than through layers of intermediaries.\u201d\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, had suggested this week that if changes were necessary in the background check process, it was the responsibility of the F.B.I. to make them.\n\n\u201cIf changes are thought to be made, that would be made by the law enforcement and intel communities that run that process, not the White House,\u201d Ms. Sanders said Monday.\n\nMr. Kelly\u2019s memo noted that he met with F.B.I. officials during his review to discuss \u201ctheir process and our process.\u201d In testimony to lawmakers on Tuesday, Christopher Wray, the F.B.I. director, said that he was \u201cquite confident that in this particular instance, the F.B.I. followed established protocols.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhite House officials had earlier said that they were unaware of the allegations against Mr. Porter because the F.B.I. had reported their concerns to a security office staffed by career officials who did not communicate to the West Wing.\n\nPeople familiar with the background check and security clearance process in prior administrations have said that such communication failures would not \u2014 and did not \u2014 occur previously because of procedures that were in place.\n\nThe changes that Mr. Kelly has ordered suggest that the process for reviewing background investigations and deciding about security clearances had all but broken down during the first year of the Trump administration.\n\nHe said that the White House should \u201cdevelop and implement written protocols governing the review of security files,\u201d suggesting that such written guidelines did not exist.\n\nMr. Kelly said that the F.B.I. should communicate \u201csignificant derogatory information\u201d about a White House employee in 48 hours \u2014 an admission that it has taken much longer than that since Mr. Trump became president.\n\nIn the future, Mr. Kelly wrote, access to \u201ccertain highly classified information\u201d will be kept from people with only interim security clearances unless they receive \u201cexplicit\u201d approval from his office, and then only \u201cin the most compelling circumstances.\u201d\n\nThat is an admission that too much highly classified information has been shared with Trump administration officials in the White House who had not received permanent security clearances.\n\nMr. Kelly\u2019s memo makes clear that the White House was aware of shortcomings and concerns with the granting of security clearances several months before Mr. Porter\u2019s case became public this month.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn September, Mr. Kelly wrote, he ended the practice of granting new interim security clearances without \u201cextraordinary circumstances and my explicit approval.\u201d\n\nHe also said that he conducted a review of all White House staff with security clearances, and in some cases reduced the level of clearances for employees who did not need access to classified materials or secret documents.\n\n\u201cI have insisted that we enforce the necessary safeguards and processes to review an individual\u2019s suitability for employment at the White House before that individual begins work,\u201d Mr. Kelly wrote.", "keywords": ["clearances", "kelly", "house", "wrote", "chief", "mr", "officials", "fbi", "overhaul", "white", "security", "process", "staff", "orders"], "polarity": 0.10888524259492001, "subjectivity": 0.38626650529876333},

Credit Photo photo by Susan Stocker\n\nA heavily armed young man is accused of killing 17 people after opening fire on terrified students and teachers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Wednesday. It was the third mass shooting in the past four months in the United States.\n\nNikolas Cruz, who has been linked to a history of mental illness, is believed to have used a legally obtained AR-15 in the shooting. The attack has led to widespread conversations about links between gun violence and mental illness, and how lawmakers and interest groups are debating potential policy responses. Below is a look at some facts and falsehoods uttered by Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin; Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont; and others in the wake of Wednesday\u2019s shooting.\n\n\u201cMental health is often a big problem underlying these tragedies.\u201d \u2014 House Speaker Paul Ryan\n\nThere\u2019s a link, but it\u2019s more limited than widely thought.\n\nMr. Ryan\u2019s claim reflects a common misconception. According to various polls, roughly half of Americans either believe that failing to identify people with mental health problems is the primary cause of gun violence or that addressing mental health issues would be a major deterrent.\n\nThat conclusion is not shared by experts or widely accepted research.\n\nIn an analysis of 235 mass killings, many of which were carried out with firearms, 22 percent of the perpetrators could be considered mentally ill.\n\nOverall, mass shootings by people with serious mental illness represent 1 percent of all gun homicides each year, according to the book \u201cGun Violence and Mental Illness\u201d published by the American Psychiatric Association in 2016.\n\nTo be sure, gun violence experts contacted by New York Times reporters have said that barring sales to people who are deemed dangerous by mental health providers could help prevent mass shootings. But the experts said several more measures \u2014 including banning assault weapons and barring sales to convicted violent criminals \u2014 more effective.\n\nAnd, as The Times has reported, Americans do not appear to have more mental health problems than other developed nations of a comparable size, which experience far fewer mass shootings.\n\nSome further research:\n\nA 2016 academic study estimated that just 4 percent of violence is associated with serious mental illness alone. \u201cEvidence is clear that the large majority of people with mental disorders do not engage in violence against others, and that most violent behavior is due to factors other than mental illness,\u201d the study concluded.\n\nA 2015 study found that less than 5 percent of gun-related killings in the United States between 2001 and 2010 were committed by people diagnosed with mental illness.\n\nAs John T. Monahan, a professor specializing in psychology and law at the University of Virginia, told The Times:\n\n\u201cTwo things typically happen in the wake of a mass shooting. First, politicians claim that mental illness is the major cause of violence in America. Then, advocates for people with mental illness respond by denying there is any relationship whatsoever between mental illness and violence. Both groups are wrong. Research shows that the association between mental illness and violence is not strong, but it does exist.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter 18 school shootings in America in just 43 days of 2018, the Congress might want to consider common-sense gun safety legislation and save innocent lives.\u201d \u2014 Senator Bernie Sanders\n\nFalse. There have been 18 instances of weapons being discharged. It would not be fair to call them all shootings.\n\nThe figure is drawn from a list maintained by the advocacy group Every Town for Gun Safety. As the group explains on its site, the total includes \u201cany time a firearm discharges a live round inside a school building or on a school campus or grounds.\u201d\n\nAs The Washington Post, The Washington Examiner and other outlets have pointed out, that includes some incidents that most people would not consider school shootings. For example, the list includes suicides, like a Florida man who shot himself in the parking lot of a school while it was closed. And it also includes accidents like a Michigan third-grader who pulled the trigger on a police officer\u2019s holstered weapon, injuring no one.\n\n\n\n\u201cIsrael pretty much eliminated [shootings] by placing highly trained people strategically to spot the one common thread \u2014 not the weapon, but a person with intent.\u201d \u2014 Former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas\n\nThis is an interpretation that the Israelis reject.\n\nIsraeli officials and experts rejected this version of events after a similar claim was made by Wayne LaPierre, the president of the National Rifle Association, after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in which 20 children and six adults were killed.\n\n\u201cIsrael had a whole lot of school shootings until they did one thing. They said, \u2018We\u2019re going to stop it,\u2019 and they put armed security in every school, and they have not had a problem since then,\u201d Mr. LaPierre said in December 2012 on NBC.\n\nYigal Palmor, a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry, told The New York Daily News at the time that the situations in the United States and Israel were \u201cfundamentally different\u201d and said that the measures that Israel enacted were a response to terrorism.\n\n\u201cWhat removed the danger was not the armed guards, but an overall antiterror policy and antiterror operations, which brought street terrorism down to nearly zero over a number of years,\u201d Mr. Palmor said.\n\n\u201cYour very first acts as president, Mr. Trump, was to actually roll back the regulations that were designed to keep firearms out of the hands of the mentally ill.\u201d \u2014 Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel.\n\nTrue, but the rule\u2019s scope was narrow.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump focused on mental health in his national address on Thursday in response to the Parkland shooting, many journalists, activists and others, like Mr. Kimmel, noted the repeal of a rule that would have prevented \u201cseriously mentally ill\u201d people from purchasing guns.\n\nFederal law already bars anyone who \u201chas been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution\u201d from purchasing a gun. And a majority of states have laws requiring them to report mental health information to the national background check system. But gaps in the system still exist.\n\nAfter the Newtown shooting, President Obama proposed adding another data source to the background check system: reports from the Social Security Administration of people who receive disability benefits through a third party because of mental impairments. According to a 2016 White House fact sheet, the rule would have affected 75,000 people.\n\nIt was opposed by the National Rifle Association, but also the American Civil Liberties Union, which said the rule violated civil rights. Some disability rights groups also argued against the rule on the basis that it perpetuated stigmas about mental illness.\n\nMr. Trump signed a congressional resolution that expressed disapproval of the proposed rule in February 2017, nine months before compliance would have been required.\n\nLinda Qiu is a fact-check reporter, based in Washington.

Though Mr. Pinedo \u201cwas not directly involved in the registration of these accounts using stolen identities,\u201d they wrote, \u201che willfully and intentionally avoided learning about the use of stolen identities.\u201d\n\nAnd though he did not know the precise identity of his Russian clients, Mr. Pinedo \u201cfrequently\u201d bought and sold account numbers with people he knew were outside the United States, the prosecutors said.\n\nSeveral of those account numbers were ultimately sold to Russians involved in the election influence operation, the documents show. They were used by the Russians to open PayPal accounts and allowed the Russians to get around company security measures meant to verify the identity of account holders.\n\nThe PayPal accounts were then used to make purchases, including on social media accounts associated with the Internet Research Agency, the St. Petersburg-based operation at the center of the Russian disinformation campaign. In total, the Russians obtained and used 14 bank account numbers between June 2016 and March 2017. It is unclear how many were purchased from Mr. Pinedo.\n\n\u201cSome PayPal accounts were used to purchase advertisements on Facebook\u201d promoting fake social media accounts created by the Russians, the papers said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTheir goal, as has now been well documented, was to sow discord in the American political process.

Ryan, said. \u201cIt was a conspiracy to subvert the process, and take aim at democracy itself.\u201d\n\nThe Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, said the indictment was \u201cfurther proof that Vladimir Putin directed a campaign to interfere with our elections, with the goal of tipping the outcome.\u201d He called on Mr. Trump to immediately reverse his decision not to impose sanctions against Russia that were recently passed by Congress.\n\nRepresentative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, argued that any attempts to remove Mr. Mueller or Mr. Rosentein \u201cwill have to be seen as a direct attempt to aid the Russian government in attacking American democracy.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has not hesitated to put Mr. Mueller\u2019s future in jeopardy.

In an interview with The New York Times, he complained that Mr. Mueller\u2019s office was rife with conflicts of interest and that the investigation had crossed a red line.\n\nA month earlier, several officials said, Mr. Trump actually gave an order to fire Mr. Mueller but backed down after Mr. McGahn threatened to resign rather than carry it out.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s strategy for dealing with charges of Russian meddling has not varied much since the campaign: deny, obfuscate, play down and, since Election Day, blame it on Democrats bitter after Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat.\n\nVideo\n\nIn May, Mr. Trump told Lester Holt, the NBC News anchor, \u201cThis Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It\u2019s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should\u2019ve won.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn September, he tweeted that \u201cthe Russia hoax continues, now it\u2019s ads on Facebook. What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?\u201d PolitiFact called Mr. Trump\u2019s denial of Russian meddling its 2017 \u201cLie of the Year.\u201d\n\nSince taking office, Mr. Trump has often expressed concern that the charges undermine the legitimacy of his presidency. He has told associates that if he accepts the premise of Russian meddling, it will call into question the idea that he won the election on his own merits.\n\nThat fear drove many of Mr. Trump\u2019s most incendiary tweets and statements throughout his first year in office, especially about the size and breadth of his electoral victory. The day after his inauguration, Mr. Trump ordered his press secretary, Sean Spicer, to insist that his inaugural crowd was the largest in history, which it demonstrably was not.\n\nIn news conferences, on Twitter and at rallies, he has called the Russia investigation \u201cfake news\u201d and repeatedly predicted that Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation will end without finding much.\n\nMr. Mueller\u2019s indictment does not settle the overarching question of whether Mr. Trump or any of his campaign associates colluded with Russia. For now, the president has seized on that as evidence of his innocence.\n\nBut as Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, put it, \u201cThe indictment leaves open the vital question of whether Americans, including any associated with the Trump campaign, knowingly played a role in Russia\u2019s active-measures campaign.\u201d\n\nThat seemed a likely avenue of inquiry for an investigation that is casting a lengthening shadow on Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.", "keywords": ["campaign", "indictment", "claim", "muellers", "sell", "mr", "russian", "russia", "investigation", "harder", "told", "york", "trump", "hoax", "trumps", "makes"], "polarity": 0.007372584976751644, "subjectivity": 0.3858453082411415},

If they want to see the devil, let them see him.\u201d\n\nMr. Prigozhin\u2019s critics \u2014 including opposition politicians, journalists and activists, the United States Treasury and now the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III \u2014 say he has emerged as Mr. Putin\u2019s go-to oligarch for that and a variety of sensitive and often-unsavory missions, like recruiting contract soldiers to fight in Ukraine and Syria.\n\n\u201cHe is not afraid of dirty tasks,\u201d said Lyubov Sobol of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, an organization established by the prominent opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny to investigate abuse of state contracts and other illicit schemes.\n\n\u201cHe can fulfill any task for Putin, ranging from fighting the opposition to sending mercenaries to Syria,\u201d she said. \u201cHe serves certain interests in certain spheres, and Putin trusts him.\u201d\n\nThe United States imposed sanctions against Mr. Prigozhin in December 2016, followed by his two main, publicly acknowledged companies, Concord Management and Consulting, and Concord Catering. In doing so, the Treasury Department said he provided extensive support to senior Russian Federation officials, including constructing a military base near Ukraine that was used to deploy Russian troops.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe most notorious venture linked to Mr. Prigozhin, however, is the troll farm that is accused of attacking opposition figures in Russia and seeking to magnify and aggravate social and political divisions in the West. Despite his frequent denials of any involvement, his critics say he and others like him provide a way for the Kremlin to engage in such activities while maintaining a discreet distance.\n\nThe indictment on Friday says, among other charges, that Mr. Prigozhin frequently met in 2015 and 2016 with Mikhail I. Bystrov, the top official in the troll factory, which ran a disinformation campaign called Project Lakhta that by September 2016 had a monthly budget of $1.2 million.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBoris L. Vishnevsky, an opposition member of the city council in St. Petersburg, who has called for an official investigation into threats by Mr. Prigozhin against journalists, said the Kremlin endorsed projects like the troll farm without directly organizing them.\n\n\u201cThis is done by somebody who receives large-scale government contracts,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that he gets these contracts is a hidden way to pay for his services.\u201d\n\nWhen the troll factory was formed in 2013, its basic task was to flood social media with articles and comments that painted Russia under Mr. Putin as stable and comfortable compared to the chaotic, morally corrupt West. The trolls soon branched into overseas operations focused on Russian adversaries like Ukraine and the United States.\n\nFacebook, Twitter and Google have all identified the Internet Research Agency as a prime source of provocative posts on divisive American issues, including race, religion, gun laws and gay rights, particularly during the 2016 presidential election. Facebook found, for example, that the agency had posted 80,000 pieces of content that reached more than 126 million Americans.\n\nLast month, Twitter announced it had started emailing more than 677,000 people in the United States who interacted with accounts from the agency during the election.\n\nMr. Prigozhin said he was too busy to be interviewed for this article; in fact, he has given just two extended interviews in the past decade. He issued a denial of the accusations of meddling in the 2016 election, however, after a recent investigation published by the Russian newsmagazine RBC.\n\n\u201cNeither Concord Company nor other structures owned by the businessman are in any way connected with the activities directed toward meddling in the U.S. election,\u201d RBC quoted one of Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s representatives as saying.\n\nDmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, also denied any Kremlin connection to the Internet Research Agency.\n\nVideo\n\nDespite Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s veil of secrecy, limited details about his personal life have emerged, mostly through the Instagram accounts of his two grown children.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne picture featured his son, Pavel, walking naked on the deck of the 115-foot family yacht. Other pictures showed a private jet and a vintage powder blue Lincoln Continental, said to be Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s favorite car.\n\nHis daughter Polina posted a picture of the sweeping view from his wooded compound in Gelendzhik, the resort town on the Black Sea. The compound, including a pier for the yacht, was built in an ostensibly protected forest much beloved by Mr. Putin and his cronies, according to the Anti-Corruption Foundation.\n\nThe day after researchers from the foundation leafed through the Instagram accounts and took multiple screen shots, the accounts went private. The foundation launched a drone over the sprawling family compound outside St. Petersburg to photograph what it said were father-daughter mansions and various amenities, including a full basketball court and a helicopter pad.\n\nDelovoy Peterburg, an independent daily newspaper published in St. Petersburg, listed him last year as ranking 83rd among the city\u2019s 304 ruble billionaires, with 11 billion rubles, or almost $200 million. The newspaper included only property in the public record, said Irina Pankratova, an investigative reporter. If all property linked to him had been counted, she said, he would rank in the Top 5.\n\nBorn in 1961 in what was then Leningrad, now St. Petersburg, Mr. Prigozhin showed adolescent promise as a champion cross-country skier that was cut short in 1981 by a prison sentence for robbery and other crimes, according to an extensive biography compiled by Meduza, an online investigative publication.\n\nWhen he got out after nine years, he started the hot-dog business, which led to his running a chain of convenience stores and eventually to starting several deluxe if kitschy restaurants in St. Petersburg. His patrons \u201cwanted to see something new in their lives and were tired of just eating cutlets with vodka,\u201d Mr. Prigozhin told a magazine called Elite Society.\n\nAn old rust bucket that he and his soon-to-be-jettisoned partners converted to the floating New Island Restaurant became St. Petersburg\u2019s most fashionable dining spot.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEventually, Mr. Putin himself showed up, towing world leaders. He hosted President Jacques Chirac of France and his wife in 2001 and President George W. Bush in 2002. President Putin celebrated his own birthday there in 2003.\n\nDuring these glittering occasions, Mr. Prigozhin made sure to hover nearby, sometimes even clearing empty plates.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Interpreter Newsletter Understand the world with sharp insight and commentary on the major news stories of the week.

The president \u201csaw how I built my business starting from a kiosk,\u201d Mr. Prigozhin told Gorod 812, a St. Petersburg magazine. \u201cHe saw how I was not above serving a plate.\u201d\n\nThe first significant state contracts began flowing in after Mr. Prigozhin founded Concord Catering. Starting with the St. Petersburg schools, he moved on to feeding the far more numerous Moscow schools and, finally, most of the Russian military. His trademark became lavish state banquets, including inauguration feasts for both recent presidents, Dmitri A. Medvedev and Mr. Putin.\n\nIn just the past five years, Mr. Prigozhin has received government contracts worth $3.1 billion, the Anti-Corruption Foundation reported.\n\nLately, he has branched out into areas like recruiting contract soldiers to fight overseas and establishing a popular online news service that pushes a nationalist viewpoint, making him even more indispensable to Mr. Putin.\n\nA leading news website in St. Petersburg, Fontanka, which has reported extensively on Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s military contracts, recently discovered another potential source of revenue, perhaps the biggest yet. In exchange for providing soldiers to protect Syria\u2019s oil fields, companies linked to Mr. Prigozhin were awarded a percentage of the oil revenue, the website reported.\n\nSome Russian contract soldiers in Syria were back in the news this month after a Feb. 7 clash between Kurdish forces, backed by the United States, and Syrian government forces aided by Russian mercenaries. Reports about exactly what happened remain murky, but anywhere from five to 200 Russian soldiers have been reported killed. The Russian Foreign Ministry on Thursday confirmed five deaths, but has refused to confirm that it has contract soldiers fighting in Syria, fueling anger among the families of those fighting about the lack of information.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt has always been difficult to find his fingerprints directly on any of these shadowy firms, said Denis Korotkov, a reporter for Fontanka. The only clues are the companies\u2019 overlapping ties, including the same managers, shared telephone numbers or IP addresses.\n\nAfter studying this material, Fontanka and the Anti-Corruption Foundation concluded in 2016 that significant government contracts were going to clusters of fake companies designed to circumvent federal rules on competitive bidding.\n\nState regulators also reviewed eight Defense Ministry contracts won by businesses linked to Mr. Prigozhin and issued a stern rebuke in May 2017.\n\nRussian law mandates that any contract go to the lowest bidder, but the winning tenders were only a fraction lower than the rest. Otherwise the bids were virtually identical, the Anti-Monopoly Service said, calling the 2015 bids fixed.\n\nThe government announced that it would not press charges. Nobody anticipates Mr. Prigozhin appearing in a Russian court any time soon.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect him to be punished given that he is among the president\u2019s closest friends,\u201d said Maksim L.

Alex Bowman, 24, who replaced Earnhardt in the No. 88 car for Hendrick Motorsports, will start the Daytona 500 from the pole position.

A graduate of Nascar\u2019s Drive for Diversity program, Darrell Wallace Jr., 24, could give stock car racing something it has never had before: an African-American star.\n\nBut that is not why Richard Petty brought Wallace onto his team. Late last season, Wallace, who goes by the nickname Bubba, got four rides with Richard Petty Motorsports. It was enough for Petty, one of Nascar\u2019s most iconic names, to not only give Wallace a full-time ride, but also to give him his famed No. 43 racecar to drive. Wallace is the first African-American to drive full-time in the top Nascar series since Wendell Scott in 1971.\n\nPetty insisted, though, that he is colorblind when it comes to evaluating talent. Sure, it would be great if Wallace brings the sport into the African-American community, but as far as Petty is concerned, that\u2019s secondary.\n\n\u201cI hope he advances us as a race team,\u201d Petty said in an email. \u201cI care about what Bubba can do behind the wheel for us. The rest, there are a lot of eyes on Bubba, but he\u2019s handling it well. I know come Sunday he\u2019ll be ready to get into a racecar and just show his talent. If he does well, the rest will come and he\u2019ll grow our fan base.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThose eyes on Wallace, much as they were on Tiger Woods a generation ago, prompted Earnhardt to call him last week.

But there\u2019s also venturing out into a different market, into different avenues where the African-American culture lives. We all have to do better at that.\u201d\n\nThere are challenges, of course. On social media, where vulgar epithets can be spewed from faceless and fictitious monikers, Wallace has, at times, had to think twice before responding. He admits he has not always been successful.\n\n\u201cThere is always going to be haters out there, people who don\u2019t want to see you succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that since Day 1 from my parents. Just keep your head down and keep moving, that\u2019s the best you can do.\u201d\n\nBlaney, his closest friend on the circuit, has been around Wallace when offensive remarks have been made.\n\n\u201cThankfully, it\u2019s very, very rare, but it upsets me,\u201d Blaney said. \u201cBubba\u2019s great at handling it. He\u2019s an amazing ambassador for the sport. And he\u2019s really talented and a heck of a competitor. All of us are competitive, but his competitiveness is unlike anyone I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nNascar\u2019s diversity has become an issue again after its only female racer, Danica Patrick, announced she will retire from the circuit after the Daytona 500. But Wallace is not the only driver who can energize an overlooked community. What he can do for an African-American audience, Su\u00e1rez can do for the Latino market. A native of Monterrey, Mexico, Su\u00e1rez said he had noticed an uptick in social media messages from a variety of Latino countries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually either people who tell me they\u2019re now following the sport because of me, or they\u2019ve been fans and now they have a driver to root for,\u201d said Su\u00e1rez, who is also a graduate of the Drive for Diversity program. \u201cThe potential is huge. This is the most diverse country in the world, but we have to improve diversity in Nascar. If we can make the sport more diverse, we\u2019ll see the same thing with fans. More diversity on the racetrack will mean more diversity in the stands.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Nascar waits, wondering who will emerge as its next star.", "keywords": ["diversity", "africanamerican", "petty", "hes", "drive", "waits", "nascar", "wallace", "emerge", "sport", "su\u00e1rez", "leader", "generation", "racing"], "polarity": 0.13599389129389128, "subjectivity": 0.4590651755651755},

After graduating from Lanier High School, he went to Morehouse College, the historically black institution in Atlanta, and was working on the student newspaper when it published some of the early writings of another Morehouse student, Martin Luther King Jr. Mr. Bennett graduated in 1949, the year after King did, and went to work at the black newspaper Atlanta Daily World.\n\nHe moved to Jet magazine in Chicago in 1953 as an associate editor and to Ebony, its sister publication, a year later. He became senior editor there in 1958 and later executive editor. He worked for the magazine into his 80s.\n\n\u201cBefore the Mayflower\u201d established Mr. Bennett as a leading scholarly voice during the racial ferment of the 1960s.

Despite his reputation as an emancipator, Mr. Bennett wrote, Lincoln was actually a white supremacist who thought that the races would be better off separated, \u201cpreferably with the Atlantic Ocean or some other large, deep body of water between them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe man\u2019s character, his way with words and his assassination, together with the psychological needs of a racist society, have obscured his contradictions under a mountain of myths,\u201d he added.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn an interview after the article was published, he stuck to his guns. \u201cLast year, during the riot season, President Johnson said he hoped he would handle himself as Lincoln did during the Civil War,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he does, it will be a disaster.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Bennett expanded on his argument in 2000 in the book \u201cForced Into Glory: Abraham Lincoln\u2019s White Dream.\u201d The historian James M.

At every level of society, people have grown accustomed to kickbacks and political connections determining who prospers, and who goes without.\n\nMr. Zuma\u2019s demise resonates as a sign of a potential new order taking shape. He will forever be linked to his association with the Guptas, three Indian-born brothers who effectively bought key levers of governmental power, amassing influence so comprehensive that it became known as \u201cstate capture.\u201d\n\nHis resignation has raised hopes that South Africa is finally contending with its epidemic of corruption. That view gained momentum when an elite police unit raided a home belonging to the Guptas nearly at the same moment that Mr. Ramaphosa was assuming office.\n\nThe new president is a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle, a former deputy president and chairman of the National Planning Commission, a focal point for thinking about how to engineer economic growth. As a former trade union leader and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Mandela, he enjoys credibility among a range of interest groups, while carrying a reputation as a savvy and strategic operator.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe has had his brushes with controversy, most notably after a 2012 police massacre of striking platinum miners that killed 34 people. At the time, Mr. Ramaphosa occupied a seat on the board of Lonmin, the company that owned the mine. Emails soon surfaced showing that, a day before the police opened fire, Mr. Ramaphosa had been urging senior government officials to take strong action to end the strike.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, no corruption charges have stuck to the new president, who now claims a mandate to clean up the toxic mess left behind by Mr. Zuma.\n\nSome doubt whether the A.N.C. can be salvaged as an effective vehicle for egalitarian policymaking. The party\u2019s executive ranks include many figures implicated in corruption. Mr. Ramaphosa, 65, may champion new initiatives aimed at generating economic growth, yet he finds himself relying on his party brethren to execute his visions, with no certainty that the money will land where intended.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think that taking the president out does much to dismantle the patronage network,\u201d said Ayabonga Cawe, a development economist at Xesibe Holdings, a research and advisory firm in Johannesburg. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need a lot more than taking out the guy at the top.\u201d\n\nAbove all, Mr. Ramaphosa must contend with the structural defects that have long constrained South Africa\u2019s economy, a legacy of apartheid.\n\nBeyond its systemic discrimination against black people, apartheid severed the country from much of the global economy. It ensured that huge numbers of uneducated black South Africans were available at poverty-level wages within major sectors of the economy like mining, agriculture and textiles. That cushioned domestic companies from the pressure to modernize.\n\nPhoto\n\nInternational sanctions isolated South Africa, shielding its firms from competition against multinational rivals. Sanctions also denied South African companies the ability to operate abroad, giving them an incentive to focus on the domestic market. The apartheid-era government obliged with subsidies for favored firms while allowing companies to pursue oligopoly, free of nuisances like antitrust law.\n\nThe result was a system in which large industries, from retail to furniture-making to chemicals, were dominated by huge enterprises whose core strength was the ability to protect themselves against competition. That system has largely prevailed, with smaller companies and start-ups facing often-impossible odds.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cApartheid was a system that lends itself to large conglomerates and concentrations of wealth in the hands of a few,\u201d Mr. Cawe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the corruption. It\u2019s about all of these parallel networks in big business that you need to dismantle. Most of those are white.\u201d\n\nHere is a world that Mr. Ramaphosa knows keenly, having achieved extraordinary affluence by running South African companies with interests in mining, banking, real estate and telecommunications. His fortune has been estimated at $450 million.\n\nIf he is serious about reinvigorating the economy and creating a space for black-owned small businesses, he will need to take on the prevailing structure that made him so wealthy.\n\nHis success on that front may be even more decisive than whether he can tame corruption.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly the most optimistic moment for South Africa in a very long time,\u201d said Mr. Goldin, the former adviser to Mr. Mandela. \u201cIn a way, it does feel like a new beginning.

The aggressive pace of deportations of immigrants of color, the elimination of the DACA program protecting immigrant children and the proposals propounded by the anti-immigration voices in the administration will all have the undeniable effect of slowing the rapid racial diversification of the United States population. Despite this sweeping attempt at racial social engineering, few voices in progressive and Democratic circles are responding with the kinds of outrage that one would expect.\n\nThe pro-white preferences of Donald Trump and his administration, especially when it comes to immigration, are legion. From the day he opened his presidential campaign in 2015 by demonizing Mexicans to the enthusiasm generated by the calls for building a wall along the Mexican border to aggressively ramping up deportations of immigrants of color to eliminating DACA to vulgarly denigrating African nations and Haiti, this administration has been quite clear about its preference for white people.\n\nIt should be no surprise, then, that the immigration policies championed by the White House would all have the effect of reducing the number of people of color coming into the country. A recent study by The Washington Post found that the administration\u2019s proposals to curtail legal immigration by limiting family reunification would slightly delay the date when whites become a minority. \u201cBy greatly slashing the number of Hispanic and black African immigrants entering America, this proposal would reshape the future United States,\u201d the economist Michael Clemens said.\n\n\u201cDecades ahead,\u201d he added, \u201cmany fewer of us would be nonwhite or have nonwhite people in our families.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe administration\u2019s focus is not random.

Since the passage of the 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act, the chromatic composition of the country\u2019s population has undergone a fundamental transformation. People of color used to make up 12 percent of the United States population in 1965, and that percentage has more than tripled over the past several decades to the point where nonwhite people are nearly 39 percent of the residents of the United States (it is no accident that the country\u2019s first African-American president was elected when he was elected). Mr. Trump\u2019s team understands that the specific laws it seeks to eliminate have played a significant role in that demographic revolution.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

The very first immigration law passed, the Naturalization Act of 1790, declared that to become a citizen, one had to be a \u201cfree white person.\u201d That demarcation was the explicit law of the land for the next 162 years, until 1952. There are 20th-century Supreme Court cases explicitly holding that Asian immigrants could not become United States citizens because they were not white. Even after 1952, the practical effect of immigration policy continued to promote white people above others through mechanisms such as the Asia Pacific Triangle, which restricted immigration from Asian countries.", "keywords": ["sign", "nonwhite", "states", "immigration", "america", "color", "white", "immigrants", "wants", "united", "population", "trump", "effect"], "polarity": 0.07678771845438513, "subjectivity": 0.2882194965528299},

Almost all of those who led the campaign to bring him to account were black, like Thuli Madonsela, the former public protector, who played a heroic role in exposing Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption. South Africa\u2019s judiciary, which is majority black, defended the independence of the courts with extraordinary courage and under great pressure. After this display of black courage, why would it matter what white people think?\n\nBut South Africa is too fraught and complex a place for such a simple story to ring true. More plausible is that each pinprick penetrating Mr. Zuma\u2019s skin is felt by black South Africans, even those who are horrified by what he has done.\n\nBeneath the surface of public life, one can detect a strange, subliminal to-and-fro. Last year, for instance, a superb book describing in meticulous detail the deep corruption of the late apartheid years, \u201cApartheid Guns and Money,\u201d by Hennie van Vuuren, was a runaway best seller. It deserved to be widely read, but the scale of its success is partly a function of its utility as a weapon against white arrogance. \u201cHowever bad Zuma is,\u201d its many black readers could say to themselves, \u201cyou people were worse.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nTo shrug and say that we are all equally capable of stealing public money is to miss what is distinctive about the mess Mr. Zuma has made. For the truth is that Mr. Zuma and his allies were corrupt partly because they felt a sense of grievance intimately connected to their experience of race.\n\nWhen Mr. Zuma became president of South Africa in 2009, he rallied behind him an alliance of people who felt themselves to be marginal and neglected, not just in relation to the world economic order or white South Africa but also in relation to the A.N.C. itself. The A.N.C. has been run by people drawn from the ranks of an urbane, cosmopolitan elite.\n\nMr. Zuma represented a dramatic change in this tradition. Although he spent years in exile and climbed the ranks of the A.N.C., his biography was unlike any of his predecessors\u2019. Nelson Mandela was born into royalty. Thabo Mbeki was the son of prominent intellectuals. Mr. Zuma\u2019s mother worked in the kitchen of a white family and was too poor to provide her son with a formal education. He grew up herding cattle in the hinterland.\n\nWhen he came to power in 2009, he did so with the support of organizations representing much of the urban working class \u2014 the country\u2019s largest trade union and the South African Communist Party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut he soon dropped these organizations and turned for support to rural South Africa, in particular to traditional leaders and to the elites of far-flung provincial capitals. They carried with them into power an abiding sense of powerlessness, a feeling that the very institutions they now controlled were alien and belonged to others. In office, they believed that they had entered into their enemy\u2019s mansion. It seemed to be payback time.\n\nIn a speech delivered to a room of black businesspeople in December 2016, Mr. Zuma warned of the sophisticated ways in which the enemy confuses black people. One source of such confusion was the prevailing economic orthodoxy. Mr. Zuma suggested that the most fundamental of economic laws was merely nominal; remove the scales from our eyes and we see that so-called economic laws are a ruse invented by the powerful.\n\nHis genre of criminality is light-years from the sort that characterized the apartheid state. The corruption of apartheid\u2019s leaders stemmed from arrogance; they believed that they could control the world forever. Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption stems from the grievances of a man who feels very small.\n\nThis sense of grievance was on display in the last words he uttered publicly as president. In a swipe at his successor, Mr. Ramaphosa, Mr. Zuma suggested that those in the party who had unseated him were \u201cserving the interests of the oppressors of yesteryear, who joyfully celebrate as we lynch one another.\u201d\n\nBlack nationalism in South Africa has many faces. Mr. Ramaphosa represents a strand that is bourgeois, worldly and comfortable with power. There is also a militant, socialist strand of black nationalism, but it is on the wane. And there is the strand represented by Mr. Zuma, who governed as a man shaped and distorted by the violence and oppression of white supremacy.\n\nI am of course alive to the irony of a white South African like me saying that a black president\u2019s corruption was motivated by racial grievance. Many South Africans, black and white, would regard this argument as an excuse for the intolerable. But we should be honest enough to accept that even now, notwithstanding that apartheid has been gone since before nearly half the South African population was born, the legacy of white supremacy has lived on in the man who was president.", "keywords": ["economic", "south", "zumas", "apartheid", "mess", "whats", "mr", "corruption", "white", "zuma", "africa", "black", "jacob", "distinctive"], "polarity": 0.0616115067727971, "subjectivity": 0.37158776707163793},

Evenly lit, crisply photographed, they look like pictures from an illustrated medical dictionary, indexical images of heads, torsos and mouths that are detached from context. Even in a work like \u201cFigure\u201d (1991), the figure in question, sheathed in a black dress and set in the black infinity of no particular place, feels like a fragment, as though she had been extracted from a group photo or a furnished room. The texts accompanying her, eight engraved plastic plaques, read like excerpts from a language primer: \u201cfigured the worst,\u201d \u201che was disfigured,\u201d \u201cfigured there would be no reaction\u201d and so on. Here, not only has the story been winnowed down; it is in fact completely gone. There\u2019s no story. We are left with only the tensions of concrete poetry.\n\nSometime in the mid-1990s, Simpson began to detect clich\u00e9d responses to her work. At the same time, her own thinking was evolving. What does an image of a black woman mean? A commentary on race? An assertion about gender? Simpson branched out from figure-based images and began to experiment more with varied subject matter \u2014 landscapes and inanimate objects like wigs \u2014 and also with unusual quasi-sculptural material like felt and standing screens. A series of monumental multisectional images, several of them landscapes, collectively titled \u201cPublic Sex\u201d (1995-1998) and featuring no figures at all, addressed the provocative title only obliquely. These pictures, made over many years, contain what the scholar and curator Okwui Enwezor calls \u201cthe rumor of the body.\u201d Mysteries of a jagged and deadpan sort, they would go on to influence the noirish tone of Simpson\u2019s later film work.\n\nPhoto\n\nSimpson began to set ever more intricate conceptual layers between her initial inspiration for a work and the finished product. The idea for \u201c9 Props\u201d (1995) began during a residency at the Pilchuck Glass School in Washington. With the aid of artisans at the school, she fabricated a series of dark vessels modeled on vases and other objects used in the portrait work of the pioneering Harlem photographer James Van Der Zee. But these vessels were not the final work. She shipped them back to New York and then photographed them against a plain background. And that still was not the work. Further intervention followed: She turned those photographic images into nine lithographs, which she printed on felt. Finally, she wrote captions below each lithographed vessel, describing the context in which it originally appeared. One of them, for instance, reads:\n\nDinner Party with boxer Harry Wills, 1926 James VanDerZee Harry Wills a k a \u201cThe Black Panther,\u201d boxer, businessman- sits with seven other men and women, mostly women with champagne glasses raised as a woman on his left makes a toast in his honor. There are three bottles of champagne, a crystal decanter, a bottle of port, an arrangement of flowers and fruit, and before each guest an untouched china place setting.\n\nPhoto\n\nFrom multiple directions, the work gestures at what cannot be seen: the original placement of the vessels that inspired Simpson\u2019s own, the people in the photographs by James Van Der Zee, the social life of Harlem evoked by his photographs and the complexity of manners and class implied by them. All that vanished world of culture and experience is reduced to an elegant grid, as simple as an antiquarian\u2019s catalog, a thought picture that demands calm engagement and imaginative intervention on the viewer\u2019s part. Without being representational, it is about race; but race is not off in some category by itself, hemmed in only by questions of skin color, separate from life.\n\n\u201cRepresent!\u201d in the black American sense means standing up for your people, expressing solidarity and letting a shared ethos underwrite your presence and work. It is an exhortation, a greeting and a farewell. The word also has more conventional associations. In the visual arts, it is contrasted with the abstract or the symbolic. To represent, in this more common sense, is to make work that visually corresponds to realities out there in the world: to illustrate uncomplicatedly. This second sense of \u201crepresent\u201d is enjoying a vogue in the art world. Realism is back. This is welcome: after so long an absence of black figures and black faces in art museums, they are now being seen more frequently. Many artists, black and otherwise, are depicting the black body. It is necessary and often successful. Just as often, it fails when it is little more than a clumsy shorthand for socially concerned art, unobjectionable and unimpressive.\n\nA strong appeal of Simpson\u2019s work is that she has always embraced the inherent complexity of blackness, her own blackness as well as the blackness that runs ineluctably through American history. She does not reject representational depictions, but neither does she feel the need to confine herself only to \u201crace\u201d work. When an artist uses a black model, she is presenting a human question by foregrounding a human presence. Is a white man a person while a black woman is and can only be a gendered and racialized subject? As the scholar Kellie Jones has pointed out, nonwhite bodies are often thought of as \u201cnot neutral enough for the dispassionate formulas thought to constitute conceptual practice.\u201d If a black woman\u2019s race and gender are the only things apparent to certain viewers, Simpson seems to say, the ethical responsibility to escape those shackles is the viewer\u2019s.\n\nFreedom is Lorna Simpson\u2019s starting point and her permanent theme. A humane current animates all of her work, a current that neither sidesteps nor confines itself to race. Her work is simultaneously about the \u201cneutral\u201d space of ideas and the particularized experience of the body. \u201cMontage\u201d is photographic and painterly, a riff on a pair of found photographs, sequenced to look like a giant strip of film. It deals with dreams and nightmares, ambiguities and vulnerabilities. At its heart is what Simpson calls \u201cthe push and pull of photography\u201d: the stuttering potential inherent in mechanical reproduction and the imperfect registrations that mirror subconscious life. It is a rapid response to the current political climate, situating a crucial part of it in the most intimate space of all, where the hectoring \u201cthey\u201d is temporarily held at bay in favor of the puzzled \u201cI.\u201d In your own sleeping bed, images persist and words are hard to come by.

There would be retaliation for stories they didn\u2019t like, but nothing compared with this. There\u2019s a war going on.

This is a key piece that I don\u2019t think people really get: When you talk about the press, it\u2019s not about journalists; it\u2019s about the free-flowing information that the American public is supposed to get. When you bash the press, you\u2019re bashing the idea of getting truth out.\n\nWhat\u2019s the public opinion of the White House press corps? It depends on whom you talk to. We\u2019re so tribal now.

I was like, No, God, that was a little bit much.\n\nGiven how much you tangle with this particular administration, why do you think you get called on so much? Have you felt like a target? Yes, I have. But I have to shake that off, because I have to go in and do my job. I cover the White House. I cover all issues, particularly those that affect black and brown Americans.

It\u2019s not been one thing. It\u2019s been a pattern. So I asked. He did not answer, which I thought was a wasted moment.

Just like our kid who\u2019s not white dresses up like Captain America. I think the beautiful thing about comics is they do transcend race in a lot of ways.\u201d\n\nMary Dimacali, 29, a social media and marketing manager in Rockland County, New York, echoed that idea. She does not believe that her fianc\u00e9\u2019s 7-year-old son, Sawyer, who is white, sees the film or its characters through the lens of race. Sawyer himself, during the interview with Ms. Dimacali, said, \u201csure,\u201d when she asked if he\u2019d like to dress up as Black Panther.\n\n\u201cFor a white kid to be so open and judge based on the character\u2019s story and the personality and history, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s important,\u201d she said. \u201cBut on the flip side, I think it\u2019s also great to have a black superhero you can identify and connect to.\u201d\n\nThe character\u2019s history is unique. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1966, Black Panther rules as the king of an African technological utopia known as Wakanda. Untouched by European invaders, Wakanda exists apart from the legacies of colonization and racism. Black history and black fantasy are central to the character, and the series has brought on prominent black writers including Ta-Nehisi Coates to deepen its significance over the last 50 years.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

He is completing \u201cRise of the Black Panther,\u201d a six-part comic series for Marvel that traces the character\u2019s early history. He has tried to explain some of that history to his 7-year-old daughter, but without delving too deeply into complex concepts like Western imperialism, which she may struggle to grasp.\n\n\u201cYou want that white kid to be able to think that he can dress up in a Black Panther costume, because, to that kid, there\u2019s no difference between Captain America and Black Panther,\u201d Mr. Narcisse, 45, said. But, he added, it also involves \u201ctrying to explain what is special about T\u2019Challa and Wakanda without racism.

It\u2019s projected to make a record-breaking $165 million over Presidents\u2019 Day weekend and comparisons to last year\u2019s \u201cWonder Woman\u201d bode well for its reception and impact, particularly for black people.\n\n\u201cWhite people have the privilege of not constantly being reminded of their race in the United States, where white is the majority, whereas as a black person you don\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Vittrup said. She believes that parents in general, and white parents in particular, are reluctant to talk about race with young children. When they do, they often miss the chance to talk about inequality, even though research supports the idea that children develop an awareness of race and difference at a very young age.\n\nMs. Vittrup was careful to add that dressing as Black Panther isn\u2019t inherently appropriative or offensive. The character comes from an invented African country, and to wear his mask isn\u2019t quite the same as wearing blackface. However, in a moment where even more black heroes, like Luke Cage and Black Lightning, are finding their way into the limelight, Black Panther\u2019s relationship with the black community and its history creates an opportunity to teach nonblack children about the black experience.\n\n\u201cKids are not colorblind,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of structural inequality in our society, and kids are noticing that.

Even the clothes are an 18th-century version of current POTUS style: basic black suit and fat tie. As for Washington, he stands blank-faced, one arm extended, like a tenor taking a dignified bow.\n\n[Read remarks from the Obamas and the artists. ]\n\nUninflected dignity was the attitude of choice for well over a century, with a few breaks. In an 1836 portrait, Andrew Jackson, a demonstrative bully, sports a floor-length, red-silk-lined Dracula cloak and a kind of topiary bouffant. (A picture of Jackson, one of President Trump\u2019s populist heroes, hangs in the Oval Office.) Abraham Lincoln, seen in several likenesses, is exceptional for looking as if he may actually have weighty matters on his mind. Most of the portraits that precede and follow his are pure P.R.\n\nThis continues well into the 20th century. In a 1980 painting Jimmy Carter trades a black suit for a beige one. How revolutionary is that? And there\u2019s a Casual Fridays vogue: Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both go tieless for it. Under the circumstances, Elaine de Kooning\u2019s 1963 portrait of John F. Kennedy, a fanfare of green and blue strokes, hits like a boost of adrenaline. Rousing too, though not in a good way, is a big head shot image of Bill Clinton by the artist Chuck Close. Using his signature mosaic-like painting technique, Mr. Close turns the 42nd president into a pixelated clown.\n\nMr. Obama has much better luck with his similarly high-profile portraitist. Mr. Wiley, born in Los Angeles in 1977, gained a following in the early 2000s with his crisp, glossy, life-size paintings of young African-American men dressed in hip-hop styles, but depicted in the old-master manner of European royal portraits. More recently he has expanded his repertoire to include female subjects, as well as models from Brazil, India, Nigeria and Senegal, creating the collective image of a global black aristocracy.\n\nIn an imposingly scaled painting \u2014 just over seven feet tall \u2014 the artist presents Mr. Obama dressed in the regulation black suit and an open-necked white shirt, and seated on a vaguely thronelike chair not so different from the one seen in Stuart\u2019s Washington portrait. But art historical references stop there. So do tonal echoes of past portraits. Whereas Mr. Obama\u2019s predecessors are, to the man, shown expressionless and composed, Mr. Obama sits tensely forward, frowning, elbows on his knees, arms crossed, as if listening hard. No smiles, no Mr. Nice Guy. He\u2019s still troubleshooting, still in the game.\n\nVideo\n\nHis engaged and assertive demeanor contradicts \u2014 and cosmetically corrects \u2014 the impression he often made in office of being philosophically detached from what was going on around him. At some level, all portraits are propaganda, political or personal. And what makes this one distinctive is the personal part. Mr. Wiley has set Mr. Obama against \u2014 really embedded him in \u2014 a bower of what looks like ground cover. From the greenery sprout flowers that have symbolic meaning for the sitter. African blue lilies represent Kenya, his father\u2019s birthplace; jasmine stands for Hawaii, where Mr. Obama himself was born; chrysanthemums, the official flower of Chicago, reference the city where his political career began, and where he met his wife.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMrs. Obama\u2019s choice of Ms. Sherald as an artist was an enterprising one. Ms. Sherald, who was born in Columbus, Ga., in 1973 and lives in Baltimore, is just beginning to move into the national spotlight after putting her career on hold for some years to deal with a family health crisis, and one of her own. (She had a heart transplant at 39.) Production-wise, she and Mr. Wiley operate quite differently. He runs the equivalent of a multinational art factory, with assistants churning out work. Ms. Sherald, who until a few years ago made her living waiting tables, oversees a studio staff of one, herself.\n\nAt the same time, they have much in common. Both focused early on African-American portraiture precisely because it is so little represented in Western art history. And both tend to blend fact and fiction. Mr. Wiley, with photo-realistic precision, casts actual people in fantastically heroic roles. (He modifies his heroizing in the case of Mr. Obama, but it\u2019s still there.) Ms. Sherald also starts with realism, but softens and abstracts it. She gives all her figures gray-toned skin \u2014 a color with ambiguous racial associations \u2014 and reduces bodies to geometric forms silhouetted against single-color fields.\n\nShe shows Mrs. Obama sitting against a field of light blue, wearing a spreading gown. The dress design, by Michelle Smith, is eye-teasingly complicated: mostly white interrupted by black Op Art-ish blips and patches of striped color suggestive of African textiles. The shape of the dress, rising pyramidally upward, mountain-like, feels as if it were the real subject of the portrait. Mrs. Obama\u2019s face forms the composition\u2019s peak, but could be almost anyone\u2019s face, like a model\u2019s face in a fashion spread. To be honest, I was anticipating \u2014 hoping for \u2014 a bolder, more incisive image of the strong-voiced person I imagine this former first lady to be.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m wishing, let me mention something more. Mr. Obama\u2019s portrait will be installed, long-term, among those of his presidential peers, in a dedicated space on the second floor. Mrs. Obama\u2019s will hang in a corridor reserved for temporary displays of new acquisitions \u2014 on the first floor. It will stay there until November, after which there\u2019s no set-aside place for it to land.\n\nIf first men have an acknowledged showcase, first women \u2014 ladies or not \u2014 should too. Better, they should all be together, sharing space, offering a welcoming environment to, among others, a future first female president, and creating a lasting monument to #MeToo.", "keywords": ["fact", "sherald", "obamas", "blend", "ms", "politics", "mr", "washington", "obama", "portraits", "wiley", "black", "portrait", "paint", "fiction"], "polarity": 0.07208600786186993, "subjectivity": 0.35921572042261696},

While it is true that compared with Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton lost ground with that segment of the electorate, the clues to a new Democratic majority may be found in the coalition that elected Mr. Northam governor of Virginia, or perhaps more accurately, voted against Mr. Gillespie and his immigrant bashing.\n\nIn Virginia, polling data has made it clear that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 rhetoric backfired among minority voters as well as, crucially, among many whites. Mr. Northam won a majority of white college-educated voters, who made up a larger share of the electorate in 2017 than they did in 2016. Mr. Gillespie matched Mr. Trump with noncollege whites, but their turnout was down. And minority voters in 2017 matched their 2016 electorate share \u2014 for the first time ever there was no drop-off from the presidential to the gubernatorial election. The Democrats also expanded their margin of victory in Virginia from five percentage points in 2016 to nine points in 2017.\n\nBefore the vote in Virginia, pundits on both the right and left were speculating that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s anti-immigrant strategy was working. But in the end, election results and polling data in Virginia proved all that thinking was wrong. While each state has its own demographics and distinct politics, Virginia has voters who span demographic and economic spectrums. Majorities of voters of all races and ethnicities rejected anti-immigrant stereotypes as ugly and wrong.\n\nAccording to an election eve survey of voters by Latino Decisions, Latino voters said that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads made them less enthusiastic about him, by a 45-point margin. But it wasn\u2019t just Latino voters. By a 23-point margin (52 to 29), whites in Virginia also said the MS-13 ads turned them away from Mr. Gillespie, as did African-American and Asian-American voters by larger margins.\n\nData speaks louder than punditry, and our regression analysis of survey data paints a clear picture. Exposure to Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads actually helped drive white college-educated voters away from the Republicans. When we analyzed findings for white independents and Republicans, voters who were aware of the MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Mr. Gillespie\u2019s Democratic opponent. What should be alarming for Republicans is that this effect wasn\u2019t limited to the governor\u2019s race. The Gillespie campaign had coattail effects, but of the wrong stripe. Across all racial groups, those who were aware of Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Democratic candidates for Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates.\n\nThis means that not only is it morally just for Democrats to position themselves as the party that stands against hatred and bigotry and in favor of inclusiveness and opportunity, but it is also a strategically sound position for winning votes. Simultaneously, it sends a clear, welcoming message to Latino, African-American and Asian-American voters, while also winning over enough of the white voters who also oppose immigrant bashing.\n\nThis phenomenon is particularly true of voters who will decide crucial House and Senate races in 2018: people of color and white college-educated voters \u2014 also known as the Democratic base. Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans are clearly gearing up for a similar anti-immigrant effort in 2018. But now the mask has been pulled off. Voters get it. Democrats have an opportunity to speak out strongly against bigotry. And in doing so, they have a path to victory in 2018 and beyond.", "keywords": ["democrats", "virginia", "republicans", "immigration", "win", "mr", "ms13", "white", "gillespies", "ads", "voters", "vote"], "polarity": 0.10965551203646441, "subjectivity": 0.4705427288760622},

While there is no way to articulate the full scope of those arguments in a single essay, it\u2019s worth considering the philosophical contributions of some of the forerunners of the movement that is our most urgent manifestation of black thought today.\n\nThe end of the Civil War and the subsequent ratification of the 13th Amendment in 1865 legally abolished slavery, but blacks quickly became subject to a displaced form of violence at the hands of white supremacists across the nation who typically used false accusations of sexual assault to justify lynching black men. Police turned a blind eye to these murders, and sometimes actively facilitated them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIda B. Wells, a leading black thinker and journalist in the late-19th and early 20th centuries, and a co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, built a public career documenting lynchings and calling America to account for them. Her arguments extended and amplified those made by Frederick Douglass before her. Douglass\u2019s central claim in his seminal \u201cThe Meaning of July Fourth for the Negro\u201d was that Americans should feel shame for slavery, given their country\u2019s foundational commitment to liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We were failing our own ideals.\n\nWells pointed to the rise of lynching after the fall of slavery as not merely a legal matter to be rectified with new laws. Having fled her hometown to escape threats of her own lynching, Wells used the press to make her moral arguments. She described a nation in the grip of a dark remorse for freeing black Americans from slavery, and condemned white Americans for cruelties that violated their own commitment to the democratic project.\n\nThe horrors that Wells described were a factor in the Great Migration of blacks to the North, which fed the flourishing of black thought and cultural life that gave rise to the Harlem Renaissance. An indication that the Harlem Renaissance was always meant to be a period of radical black philosophy and social change was the name originally coined for the movement: The New Negro. Alain Locke, the Harvard-educated black intellectual who became known as the father of the Harlem Renaissance, envisioned a philosophical position that reinvigorated blacks\u2019 relationship to their culture and that would in turn solidify their status as equal co-participants in our democracy.\n\nA strong theme among some of the luminaries of the time focused on the will of blacks to assert their humanity against racism and to insist on their status as persons owed respect. Among those stars, the poet Langston Hughes was one of the brightest. His \u201cI Too\u201d is a quiet yet insistent poem depicting a black man employed by a white one and his struggle with invisibility. The protagonist resolves to sit at the table with the white folks the next day and show people how beautiful he is and that he, too, is America. The writer Zora Neale Hurston had an equally persistent but at times more playful take on the matter. In her essay \u201cHow It Feels to Be Colored Me,\u201d she wrote, \u201cSometimes, I feel discriminated against, but it does not make me angry. It merely astonishes me. How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company! It\u2019s beyond me.\u201d\n\nThinkers like Hughes and Hurston were involved in the Harlem Renaissance project of presenting a vision of black cultural vitality and worth that would rework the image of black Americans that whites typically relied upon. That stream of thought runs directly into the heart of Black Lives Matter.\n\nAnother valuable and necessary development to come out of the Black Lives Matter movement is the de-emphasizing of black patriarchy and the equal acknowledgment of the suffering of black women and the black L.G.T.B.Q. community. Though sexuality was an avenue of inquiry during the Harlem Renaissance, it was perhaps the mid- to late-20th century poet and theorist Audre Lorde who did the most to make black women\u2019s sexuality a focal point of political and social philosophy.\n\nWhile today \u201cintersectionality\u201d is bandied about as the cutting edge of social research, it was Lorde who in her writing insisted on complicating our view of personal identity by claiming that each of us belongs to multiple identity communities, all of which contribute to our sense of self and our purposes.\n\nShe also showed the broad reach of white supremacy and its effects on black Americans as they located themselves in more nuanced ways in the tapestry of American culture. For her, the primary form taken by resistance to racism was the denial of blunt categories imposed on black Americans, which stifled the possibility of an individual\u2019s full flourishing. Lorde, then, called for a radical form of self-possession whose boundaries were not open to negotiation with a white society.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen people think of Black Lives Matter, they often think of anger feeding forceful protests. Anger is a reasonable response to racial injustice. To be certain, groups like the Black Panthers and thinkers like Malcolm X advised black Americans to get angry and take the doctrine of armed self-defense seriously. Though anger and love are not mutually exclusive emotions, James Baldwin and Martin Luther King Jr. affirmed a view of civic love to pre-empt the need for violence.\n\nKing espoused a form of Kantian regard that prioritized conceiving of every human, racist or not, as owed a kind of love that is grounded in the ideal of universal respect. Baldwin held a slightly different view. He felt black Americans ought to see whites as democratic kin or family, as people with whom blacks would have serious quarrels but also people whom it would be worth keeping close in order to strengthen and bring integrity to the bonds of shared democratic life. These two views of love eschewed violence yet insisted on militancy. While forgiveness and acceptance were hallmarks of King\u2019s and Baldwin\u2019s views, so was an unyielding commitment to self-respect and the demand for social change to institutionalize the idea that blacks were co-creators of the American kingdom.\n\nThinkers like Wells, Hughes, Hurston, Lorde and Baldwin not only anticipated the current Black Lives Matter movement but provided an intellectual blueprint to give depth and integrity to that slogan, so that its meaning transcends the demand to stop police brutality. It is a demand for whites to extend their historical imagination and recognize that the ills of racism are not the result of a few bad police officers or a few out-and-out racists in some far-off corner of America. The problem, rather, is a kind of complicity \u2014 one partaking in the false comfort that America has somehow escaped the trajectory of its racially murderous history. It is necessary that we to see our society today as continuous with that history and not anomalous to it.\n\nBlack thought\u2019s primary contribution to the academy and to American society is the richness and precision with which it describes our worst demons to us, while offering a vision of how we might each save our democracy from the ruin of irrational fear and hatred.", "keywords": ["america", "americans", "movement", "blacks", "white", "harlem", "lives", "showed", "black", "renaissance", "matter"], "polarity": 0.043612258953168, "subjectivity": 0.3973699190419967},

Bell Pottinger may have set back race relations in South Africa by as much as 10 years.\u201d\n\nWithin days of the firm\u2019s removal from the trade association, clients were fleeing. By the end of September, all 250 employees were laid off and Bell Pottinger was finished.\n\nA Unique Client List\n\nLondon is now home to a cluster of P.R. firms catering to foreign governments, raising worries that the city has become \u201cthe global capital of reputation laundering,\u201d as The Evening Standard put it a few years ago. Bell Pottinger established the template of this lucrative niche.\n\nIt was largely the brainchild of Tim Bell, who had earned his reputation, along with a knighthood, helping Margaret Thatcher win three elections. He came to fame with the \u201cLabour isn\u2019t working\u201d ads that helped the Conservative Party gain control of Parliament in the 1979 general election. Colleagues actually coined the phrase, and he talked Mrs. Thatcher into adopting it.\n\n\u201cThere were many conversations in which she shouted at me and told me I was an idiot,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI just had to stand my ground and say, \u2018I know what I\u2019m doing.\u2019\u201d\n\nNow 77, Mr. Bell appears to have stepped directly out of an Evelyn Waugh novel with everything but a smoking jacket. Gray haired with an owlish pair of black glasses, he speaks with jaunty indifference and ingratiating candor, a combination that always made the tsk-tskers who disapproved of his client list sound unworldly and na\u00efve.\n\n\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Breaking News Emails Sign up to receive an email from The New York Times as soon as important news breaks around the world.

When the pair started working together in the mid-80s, Mr. Bell was sought after by political leaders and corporations who wanted some of the communications magic he had provided to Mrs. Thatcher.\n\nBell Pottinger quickly had hundreds of clients, a few of them infamous. Mr. Bell attributes his ability to work with virtually anyone to innate optimism.\n\n\u201cI see the good in people,\u201d he said.\n\nThis included Chile\u2019s former dictator Augusto Pinochet. Mr. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain in 1998 as part of an effort to deport him to Spain, where he had been indicted on a charge of torturing Spanish citizens.\n\nAfter two years of legal and political wrangling, Mr. Bell and his allies prevailed when Mr. Pinochet was authorized to freely return to Chile.\n\nBell Pottinger was hardly the only British outfit working for rogues and despots, as well as publicly traded companies, nor was it the largest or most profitable. But it had a buccaneering spirit that made it the firm of choice for a wide variety of missions.\n\n\n\nDuring the war in Iraq, Bell Pottinger had a contract with the Pentagon to produce propaganda for the United States military. This included scripts in Arabic for a soap opera that aired in the country, said Mr. Bell.\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen the company\u2019s client list did not generate news, its methods did. In 2011, it was caught boasting about its skills in the dark arts of search engine manipulation to people it thought were potential clients.\n\nIn fact, they were undercover members of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit organization that works with a variety of media. Posing as executives from the made-up Azimov Group, these \u201crepresentatives\u201d said the company had ties to the Uzbekistan regime, which has been criticized for repression and for using forced child labor during its cotton harvest.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Azimov executives said they worried about blowback.\n\nFret not, said Tim Collins, a Bell Pottinger managing director, per transcripts published by The Independent, a British newspaper. After the company applied its tech wizardry, \u201cYou get to the point where even if they type in \u2018Uzbek child labour\u2019 or \u2018Uzbek human rights violation,\u2019 some of the first results that come up are sites talking about what you guys are doing to address and improve that, not just the critical voices saying how terrible this all is.\u201d\n\nMr. Bell never challenged the transcripts, but he denounced the sting at the time as an \u201cunethical, underhand deception to manufacture a story where none exists.\u201d\n\nBeginning of the End\n\nBell Pottinger\u2019s slide into oblivion began with a visit to the Guptas in January 2016. Mr. Bell, who had worked in South Africa for years, said he had no idea what the brothers wanted, but he and several colleagues flew to Johannesburg to find out.\n\n\u201cWe went to this bloody great mansion, which seemed to be their headquarters,\u201d Mr. Bell recalled. \u201cGreat big room, huge sofas all over the place. Servants. Appalling, all of it.\u201d\n\nThe family already had a fortune, Tony Gupta told the small entourage. Now, he and his brothers wanted to help poor blacks. To that end, they wanted a P.R. campaign that pushed the idea of economic emancipation.\n\n\u201cSo we went back to London and wrote a strategy,\u201d said Mr. Bell. \u201cTown hall meetings, marching in the street, that kind of thing. Draw attention to the economic imbalance, then tell people they should protest and demand change.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe company drafted a two-page proposal, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times. Among its recommendations was \u201ca non-party political narrative around the existence of economic apartheid\u201d that Bell Pottinger would package \u201cinto speeches, news releases, website content, videos/broadcast content, slogans and other material required.\u201d\n\nSoon, the Guptas said that their company needed communications help, too. Most South Africans, the Guptas maintained, had an inflated notion of how much of the family\u2019s revenue came from government contracts, which harmed their interests, several Bell Pottinger employees recalled.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe corporate campaign was the first sign that altruism had little to do with the \u00a3100,000 a month that Bell Pottinger would earn during what was initially a three-month project. The second was the anger of the company\u2019s other South Africa clients when they learned of the arrangement.\n\nThe billionaire Johann Rupert was aghast to suddenly find himself one of the most prominent examples of \u201cwhite monopoly capital.\u201d He texted Mr. Bell and asked how his P.R. firm could also be working for a family that was bashing him. Mr. Bell, by his own account, quickly lost enthusiasm for the Gupta project.\n\n\u201cIt was altogether smelly,\u201d he said of the racial element of the work. But he quickly added that ethics were not the issue. If enough South African clients quit Bell Pottinger, he reasoned, the losses would outweigh the Guptas\u2019s checks. \u201cI was saying it\u2019s not a commercially sensible thing to do.\u201d\n\nBut by the end of March, only one client \u2014 the banking and asset management company Investec \u2014 had severed ties with the P.R. firm. After that, Bell Pottinger tried to find middle ground by signing a new contract with the Guptas, this time with a codicil literally called an anti-embarrassment clause. It allowed the firm to terminate the account \u201cwithout notice\u201d if the brothers brought discredit to the business.\n\nMr. Bell said he soon resolved to quit the company because he felt undermined and undervalued by Mr. Henderson. \u201cHe made my life a misery from start to finish,\u201d said Mr. Bell, speaking one recent afternoon in the living room of his home near London\u2019s Sloane Square. After negotiating a \u00a33.5 million exit package, Mr. Bell resigned in August 2016.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor his part, Mr. Henderson declined in a recent interview to indulge in the put-downs that come so easily to his antagonist. Seated at a conference table in temporary offices in Mayfair, where he is starting a new P.R. firm, he said Bell Pottinger\u2019s dissolution was too recent to discuss.\n\n\u201cI have huge empathy for all those impacted,\u201d he said, \u201cand believe now is not the appropriate time to go into details.\u201d\n\nInflaming Tensions\n\nThe P.R. campaign in South Africa, which started in 2016, was intended to raise the temperature of race relations. And it worked.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore than 100 fake Twitter accounts were created, all of them retweeting content from other Twitter accounts with names like @economycapture, according to media reports. Popular hashtags included #WhiteMonopolyCapital and #RespectGuptas. The campaign involved some 220,000 tweets.\n\nThere were also attack website with names like WMC Leaks and WMC Scams. Another part of this ecosystem were mainstream media outlets owned by the Guptas, like ANN7, a 24-hour news channel, and The New Age, a daily newspaper.\n\nAs the campaign spread, leaders at groups like the A.N.C. Youth League gave inflammatory speeches, decrying the \u201cstranglehold\u201d that rich whites had on the economy. Leaked emails would later show that the groups received media training, and in some cases funds, from Oakbay.\n\nAn atmosphere of menace slowly pervaded the country. In July 2016, the police minister announced the creation of a task force to investigate the murder of more than a dozen political figures. In the run-up to municipal elections that year, Mr. Zuma described the Democratic Alliance, the A.N.C.\u2019s main rival, as a \u201cwhite party,\u201d adding that it could not \u201crun this country no matter how they cover up by getting a few black stooges.\u201d\n\nNew and radical groups like Black First Land First sprang up, holding public rallies to fulminate against whites. At one, in May 2016, a pastor named Xola Skosana told the crowd, \u201cWe have been wounded beyond measure. Let us find the pillars and bring the house down. Black people must be avenged.\u201d\n\nFor the first time in years, whites felt a rising sense of personal danger. Nicholas Wolpe, a white South African whose father was a pioneer of the anti-apartheid movement, remembers a palpable anxiety. \u201cThere was a shift toward intolerance,\u201d he said. \u201cGradually, the debate about white monopoly capital was everywhere and the people talking about it were loud and belligerent. It struck a nerve.\u201d\n\nIn a related and surreptitious campaign, the Guptas were being recast as warmhearted people eager to help the downtrodden. A website connected to Black First Land First ran editorials defending the brothers, suggesting in one that they should be \u201cpraised for saving jobs.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["firm", "pottinger", "south", "bell", "end", "guptas", "company", "mr", "met", "main", "africa", "reading", "campaign", "pr", "despots", "rogues"], "polarity": 0.05728090899659527, "subjectivity": 0.3829289628309236},

Just as Ms. Robinson and Ms. Gilmore led the 1955-56 boycott of buses in Alabama, in the 1970s, women like Louise Day Hicks led the antibusing crusades in the North, in an effort to avoid the desegregation of Boston public schools. While men debated in legislative chambers and listened to challenges on the bench, women headed to school cafeterias, playgrounds and PTA meetings, doing the bulk of the behind-the-scenes work of supporting the politics of segregation.\n\nWhite women organized precinct gatherings to pressure their politicians to uphold Jim Crow laws. They transformed their homes into centers of bureaucratic efficiency \u2014 copying fliers, assigning neighborhoods for petition drives and scheduling protest shifts at elementary schools and bus garages.\n\nIt was also women who shaped the way segregation, white supremacy and ideas about racial identity were knitted into the fabric of their communities. Working as midwives, teachers and social workers, women policed the racial identity of babies, students and clients to ensure that the dividing line between white and black remained intact. And across the nation, women-led groups like Patriotic American Youth and the Women for Constitutional Government and Pro America spread the message to the next generation that opposition to racial equality was about states\u2019 rights and limited government, not white supremacy.\n\nIf narratives about white supremacy have been shaped by the overwhelmingly masculine lens through which we examine practically all political movements, there are also aspects of white supremacy that make it different. One critical factor here is the central role ascribed to white male sexual and status anxiety and lust for dominance in fomenting organized white-supremacist activities. As part of arguments against desegregation, many who belonged to these movements embraced a narrative that saw white women and girls as vulnerable (to black men), and white men as protectors \u2014 a story line that simultaneously elevated white men and rendered women helpmates and beneficiaries, not activists.\n\nBut this broader narrative obscures and even gives cover to the ways white women sometimes used white supremacy for their own gain. The suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt in the early 20th century argued for women\u2019s voting rights in Southern states on the basis that \u201cwhite supremacy will be strengthened, not weakened, by white women\u2019s suffrage.\u201d In the 1920s, the journalist Nell Battle Lewis of North Carolina never questioned the absolute need for racial segregation even as she criticized the violence committed in the name of Jim Crow. Staying in the racial fold, she was afforded the opportunity to blast her state\u2019s regressive labor and gender politics. Being a white supremacist, even a liberal one, meant that she remained part of the conversation.\n\nThe point, here, is neither to catalog nor to celebrate white women\u2019s contributions to white supremacist politics. Instead, their work should change how we understand history. It is easy to denounce the racist pronouncements and white-supremacist politics of a George Wallace or a Roy Moore. But what white women teach us is that white-supremacist politics is sustained at a much more grass-roots level by our neighbors, school boards and even friends. White women have made white supremacy a much more formidable and long-lasting force in American society, sustaining it at both the local and national levels.\n\nToday, it seems, the story America prefers to tell itself about white supremacy has changed little since the middle of the century: Instead of Klan lynchings, we focus on the rally in Charlottesville; instead of George Wallace, we focus on Jeff Sessions or, for that matter, Donald Trump.

But a new analysis from the Center for New York City Affairs at the New School takes a closer look by mapping the achievement gaps within each public elementary school in New York City. The results reveal the challenges of integrating students across the system, and of integrating under one roof.\n\nThe study is a snapshot that looks at student performance on a single test, the state math assessment given in 2016 to third through fifth graders. At each school, it looks at the race of the test takers and estimates their household income using census information about where they live.\n\nThe report illustrates how closely race, income and academic performance are tied in this city. Almost all students in the study with estimated household incomes below $30,000 were black or Hispanic, while students with household incomes above $80,000 were predominantly white. And the poorer students were, the lower they tended to score on the test, even when they went to the same school as wealthier children.\n\nTake P.S. 8, the Robert Fulton school in Brooklyn Heights, which the Center for American Progress identified last year as having one of the richest Parent Teacher Associations in the country, and which has a relatively diverse student body. While 64 percent of its students passed the state math test in 2016, compared with 36 percent of students citywide, black students at the school were nearly a full proficiency level behind their white peers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBlack students at the school also had significantly lower estimated incomes than white students.\n\nNicole Mader, the co-author of the study, said the lingering achievement gap demonstrates that just having different kinds of students together in the same building is not enough to have true integration. Students must be in the same classrooms, have the same quality of teachers and be disciplined in the same way.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Late last season, Wallace, who goes by the nickname Bubba, got four rides with Richard Petty Motorsports. It was enough for Petty, one of Nascar\u2019s most iconic names, to not only give Wallace a full-time ride, but also to give him his famed No. 43 racecar to drive. Wallace is the first African-American to drive full-time in the top Nascar series since Wendell Scott in 1971.\n\nPetty insisted, though, that he is colorblind when it comes to evaluating talent. Sure, it would be great if Wallace brings the sport into the African-American community, but as far as Petty is concerned, that\u2019s secondary.\n\n\u201cI hope he advances us as a race team,\u201d Petty said in an email. \u201cI care about what Bubba can do behind the wheel for us.

After graduating from Lanier High School, he went to Morehouse College, the historically black institution in Atlanta, and was working on the student newspaper when it published some of the early writings of another Morehouse student, Martin Luther King Jr. Mr. Bennett graduated in 1949, the year after King did, and went to work at the black newspaper Atlanta Daily World.\n\nHe moved to Jet magazine in Chicago in 1953 as an associate editor and to Ebony, its sister publication, a year later. He became senior editor there in 1958 and later executive editor. He worked for the magazine into his 80s.\n\n\u201cBefore the Mayflower\u201d established Mr. Bennett as a leading scholarly voice during the racial ferment of the 1960s. In 1966 he testified before a House Education subcommittee looking into racism and unrest, and was blunt, tracing the turmoil of the times to an education system that did not prepare students to live in a multiracial society.\n\n\u201cIt is my opinion, and the opinion of many writers and scholars in this field,\u201d he said, \u201cthat segregated textbooks \u2014 and segregated and segregating use of words, symbols and ideas \u2014 are as dangerous to the internal peace of America as segregated schools and residential areas.\u201d\n\nThat was relatively mild compared with what he said about Abraham Lincoln in a January 1968 article in Ebony. Despite his reputation as an emancipator, Mr. Bennett wrote, Lincoln was actually a white supremacist who thought that the races would be better off separated, \u201cpreferably with the Atlantic Ocean or some other large, deep body of water between them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe man\u2019s character, his way with words and his assassination, together with the psychological needs of a racist society, have obscured his contradictions under a mountain of myths,\u201d he added.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn an interview after the article was published, he stuck to his guns. \u201cLast year, during the riot season, President Johnson said he hoped he would handle himself as Lincoln did during the Civil War,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he does, it will be a disaster.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Bennett expanded on his argument in 2000 in the book \u201cForced Into Glory: Abraham Lincoln\u2019s White Dream.\u201d The historian James M. McPherson found it a flawed work.\n\n\u201cBennett,\u201d he wrote in reviewing the book in The New York Times, \u201cfails to appreciate the acuity and empathy that enabled Lincoln to transcend his prejudices and to preside over the greatest social revolution in American history.\u201d\n\nMr. Bennett\u2019s other books included \u201cWhat Manner of Man: A Biography of Martin Luther King Jr.\u201d (1964), \u201cBlack Power U.S.A.: The Human Side of Reconstruction, 1867-1877\u201d (1967) and \u201cThe Shaping of Black America\u201d (1975).\n\nIn 1965 he married Gloria Sylvester.

Townships have gotten electricity and more modern housing. Government contracts have been set aside for black would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nThese programs have had an impact, improving material conditions and generating jobs.\n\nThey have also been riddled with corruption.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt local governments across South Africa, bureaucrats have abused their authority to steer contracts to companies that put cash in their pockets. At every level of society, people have grown accustomed to kickbacks and political connections determining who prospers, and who goes without.\n\nMr. Zuma\u2019s demise resonates as a sign of a potential new order taking shape.

That view gained momentum when an elite police unit raided a home belonging to the Guptas nearly at the same moment that Mr. Ramaphosa was assuming office.\n\nThe new president is a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle, a former deputy president and chairman of the National Planning Commission, a focal point for thinking about how to engineer economic growth.

It ensured that huge numbers of uneducated black South Africans were available at poverty-level wages within major sectors of the economy like mining, agriculture and textiles. That cushioned domestic companies from the pressure to modernize.\n\nPhoto\n\nInternational sanctions isolated South Africa, shielding its firms from competition against multinational rivals. Sanctions also denied South African companies the ability to operate abroad, giving them an incentive to focus on the domestic market. The apartheid-era government obliged with subsidies for favored firms while allowing companies to pursue oligopoly, free of nuisances like antitrust law.\n\nThe result was a system in which large industries, from retail to furniture-making to chemicals, were dominated by huge enterprises whose core strength was the ability to protect themselves against competition. That system has largely prevailed, with smaller companies and start-ups facing often-impossible odds.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cApartheid was a system that lends itself to large conglomerates and concentrations of wealth in the hands of a few,\u201d Mr. Cawe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the corruption. It\u2019s about all of these parallel networks in big business that you need to dismantle. Most of those are white.\u201d\n\nHere is a world that Mr. Ramaphosa knows keenly, having achieved extraordinary affluence by running South African companies with interests in mining, banking, real estate and telecommunications. His fortune has been estimated at $450 million.\n\nIf he is serious about reinvigorating the economy and creating a space for black-owned small businesses, he will need to take on the prevailing structure that made him so wealthy.\n\nHis success on that front may be even more decisive than whether he can tame corruption.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly the most optimistic moment for South Africa in a very long time,\u201d said Mr. Goldin, the former adviser to Mr. Mandela. \u201cIn a way, it does feel like a new beginning.

For the truth is that Mr. Zuma and his allies were corrupt partly because they felt a sense of grievance intimately connected to their experience of race.\n\nWhen Mr. Zuma became president of South Africa in 2009, he rallied behind him an alliance of people who felt themselves to be marginal and neglected, not just in relation to the world economic order or white South Africa but also in relation to the A.N.C. itself. The A.N.C. has been run by people drawn from the ranks of an urbane, cosmopolitan elite.\n\nMr. Zuma represented a dramatic change in this tradition. Although he spent years in exile and climbed the ranks of the A.N.C., his biography was unlike any of his predecessors\u2019. Nelson Mandela was born into royalty. Thabo Mbeki was the son of prominent intellectuals. Mr. Zuma\u2019s mother worked in the kitchen of a white family and was too poor to provide her son with a formal education. He grew up herding cattle in the hinterland.\n\nWhen he came to power in 2009, he did so with the support of organizations representing much of the urban working class \u2014 the country\u2019s largest trade union and the South African Communist Party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut he soon dropped these organizations and turned for support to rural South Africa, in particular to traditional leaders and to the elites of far-flung provincial capitals. They carried with them into power an abiding sense of powerlessness, a feeling that the very institutions they now controlled were alien and belonged to others. In office, they believed that they had entered into their enemy\u2019s mansion. It seemed to be payback time.\n\nIn a speech delivered to a room of black businesspeople in December 2016, Mr. Zuma warned of the sophisticated ways in which the enemy confuses black people. One source of such confusion was the prevailing economic orthodoxy. Mr. Zuma suggested that the most fundamental of economic laws was merely nominal; remove the scales from our eyes and we see that so-called economic laws are a ruse invented by the powerful.\n\nHis genre of criminality is light-years from the sort that characterized the apartheid state. The corruption of apartheid\u2019s leaders stemmed from arrogance; they believed that they could control the world forever. Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption stems from the grievances of a man who feels very small.\n\nThis sense of grievance was on display in the last words he uttered publicly as president. In a swipe at his successor, Mr. Ramaphosa, Mr. Zuma suggested that those in the party who had unseated him were \u201cserving the interests of the oppressors of yesteryear, who joyfully celebrate as we lynch one another.\u201d\n\nBlack nationalism in South Africa has many faces. Mr. Ramaphosa represents a strand that is bourgeois, worldly and comfortable with power. There is also a militant, socialist strand of black nationalism, but it is on the wane. And there is the strand represented by Mr. Zuma, who governed as a man shaped and distorted by the violence and oppression of white supremacy.\n\nI am of course alive to the irony of a white South African like me saying that a black president\u2019s corruption was motivated by racial grievance. Many South Africans, black and white, would regard this argument as an excuse for the intolerable. But we should be honest enough to accept that even now, notwithstanding that apartheid has been gone since before nearly half the South African population was born, the legacy of white supremacy has lived on in the man who was president.", "keywords": ["economic", "south", "zumas", "apartheid", "mess", "whats", "mr", "corruption", "white", "zuma", "africa", "black", "jacob", "distinctive"], "polarity": 0.0616115067727971, "subjectivity": 0.37158776707163793},

Evenly lit, crisply photographed, they look like pictures from an illustrated medical dictionary, indexical images of heads, torsos and mouths that are detached from context. Even in a work like \u201cFigure\u201d (1991), the figure in question, sheathed in a black dress and set in the black infinity of no particular place, feels like a fragment, as though she had been extracted from a group photo or a furnished room. The texts accompanying her, eight engraved plastic plaques, read like excerpts from a language primer: \u201cfigured the worst,\u201d \u201che was disfigured,\u201d \u201cfigured there would be no reaction\u201d and so on. Here, not only has the story been winnowed down; it is in fact completely gone. There\u2019s no story. We are left with only the tensions of concrete poetry.\n\nSometime in the mid-1990s, Simpson began to detect clich\u00e9d responses to her work. At the same time, her own thinking was evolving. What does an image of a black woman mean? A commentary on race? An assertion about gender? Simpson branched out from figure-based images and began to experiment more with varied subject matter \u2014 landscapes and inanimate objects like wigs \u2014 and also with unusual quasi-sculptural material like felt and standing screens. A series of monumental multisectional images, several of them landscapes, collectively titled \u201cPublic Sex\u201d (1995-1998) and featuring no figures at all, addressed the provocative title only obliquely. These pictures, made over many years, contain what the scholar and curator Okwui Enwezor calls \u201cthe rumor of the body.\u201d Mysteries of a jagged and deadpan sort, they would go on to influence the noirish tone of Simpson\u2019s later film work.\n\nPhoto\n\nSimpson began to set ever more intricate conceptual layers between her initial inspiration for a work and the finished product. The idea for \u201c9 Props\u201d (1995) began during a residency at the Pilchuck Glass School in Washington. With the aid of artisans at the school, she fabricated a series of dark vessels modeled on vases and other objects used in the portrait work of the pioneering Harlem photographer James Van Der Zee. But these vessels were not the final work. She shipped them back to New York and then photographed them against a plain background. And that still was not the work. Further intervention followed: She turned those photographic images into nine lithographs, which she printed on felt. Finally, she wrote captions below each lithographed vessel, describing the context in which it originally appeared. One of them, for instance, reads:\n\nDinner Party with boxer Harry Wills, 1926 James VanDerZee Harry Wills a k a \u201cThe Black Panther,\u201d boxer, businessman- sits with seven other men and women, mostly women with champagne glasses raised as a woman on his left makes a toast in his honor. There are three bottles of champagne, a crystal decanter, a bottle of port, an arrangement of flowers and fruit, and before each guest an untouched china place setting.\n\nPhoto\n\nFrom multiple directions, the work gestures at what cannot be seen: the original placement of the vessels that inspired Simpson\u2019s own, the people in the photographs by James Van Der Zee, the social life of Harlem evoked by his photographs and the complexity of manners and class implied by them. All that vanished world of culture and experience is reduced to an elegant grid, as simple as an antiquarian\u2019s catalog, a thought picture that demands calm engagement and imaginative intervention on the viewer\u2019s part. Without being representational, it is about race; but race is not off in some category by itself, hemmed in only by questions of skin color, separate from life.\n\n\u201cRepresent!\u201d in the black American sense means standing up for your people, expressing solidarity and letting a shared ethos underwrite your presence and work. It is an exhortation, a greeting and a farewell. The word also has more conventional associations. In the visual arts, it is contrasted with the abstract or the symbolic. To represent, in this more common sense, is to make work that visually corresponds to realities out there in the world: to illustrate uncomplicatedly. This second sense of \u201crepresent\u201d is enjoying a vogue in the art world. Realism is back. This is welcome: after so long an absence of black figures and black faces in art museums, they are now being seen more frequently. Many artists, black and otherwise, are depicting the black body. It is necessary and often successful. Just as often, it fails when it is little more than a clumsy shorthand for socially concerned art, unobjectionable and unimpressive.\n\nA strong appeal of Simpson\u2019s work is that she has always embraced the inherent complexity of blackness, her own blackness as well as the blackness that runs ineluctably through American history. She does not reject representational depictions, but neither does she feel the need to confine herself only to \u201crace\u201d work. When an artist uses a black model, she is presenting a human question by foregrounding a human presence. Is a white man a person while a black woman is and can only be a gendered and racialized subject? As the scholar Kellie Jones has pointed out, nonwhite bodies are often thought of as \u201cnot neutral enough for the dispassionate formulas thought to constitute conceptual practice.\u201d If a black woman\u2019s race and gender are the only things apparent to certain viewers, Simpson seems to say, the ethical responsibility to escape those shackles is the viewer\u2019s.\n\nFreedom is Lorna Simpson\u2019s starting point and her permanent theme. A humane current animates all of her work, a current that neither sidesteps nor confines itself to race. Her work is simultaneously about the \u201cneutral\u201d space of ideas and the particularized experience of the body. \u201cMontage\u201d is photographic and painterly, a riff on a pair of found photographs, sequenced to look like a giant strip of film. It deals with dreams and nightmares, ambiguities and vulnerabilities. At its heart is what Simpson calls \u201cthe push and pull of photography\u201d: the stuttering potential inherent in mechanical reproduction and the imperfect registrations that mirror subconscious life. It is a rapid response to the current political climate, situating a crucial part of it in the most intimate space of all, where the hectoring \u201cthey\u201d is temporarily held at bay in favor of the puzzled \u201cI.\u201d In your own sleeping bed, images persist and words are hard to come by. It is the art we need now: rich, allusive, tongue-tied and unanswerable.", "keywords": ["simpsons", "simpson", "woman", "race", "cant", "art", "seen", "work", "images", "began", "black", "evoking", "world"], "polarity": 0.06682087932087931, "subjectivity": 0.4861752986752985},

To some extent, there\u2019s always been an adversarial role between the White House and reporters. How do you feel about the tenor of things now? It used to be friendly-adversarial. There would be retaliation for stories they didn\u2019t like, but nothing compared with this. There\u2019s a war going on. For a president to come out with the term \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 he\u2019s putting targets on our heads. He has moved the goal posts when it comes to how politicians and people deal with the press.\n\nWhat\u2019s the value of the White House press briefing? Transparency. There is a veil on the White House; people want to look behind the curtain. It\u2019s their house. When you open up a press briefing to see the back and forth, you\u2019re getting more in the weeds of what\u2019s going on, beyond just the quote we may put in the story. This is a key piece that I don\u2019t think people really get: When you talk about the press, it\u2019s not about journalists; it\u2019s about the free-flowing information that the American public is supposed to get. When you bash the press, you\u2019re bashing the idea of getting truth out.\n\nWhat\u2019s the public opinion of the White House press corps? It depends on whom you talk to. We\u2019re so tribal now. There used to be a day when you didn\u2019t know the person\u2019s politics. The line has been obscured between facts and opinion. I think it started during the Clinton years, and it just kept getting progressively worse. People don\u2019t want to just hear the news; they want to hear what people have to say about it too.\n\nYour reactions during the televised briefings have generated memes. Has it made you more self-conscious? I\u2019m so sad about that. My boss has always said, \u201cYou need to know how to play poker.\u201d I don\u2019t. I\u2019m trying! The last time I was really caught off guard was when Sarah Huckabee Sanders said something about people\u2019s minds being in the gutter after President Trump\u2019s tweet about Kirsten Gillibrand. I really get into those briefings. I really try to listen. I don\u2019t play to the camera. I go in there, and I\u2019m really earnest. So when she said that, I was shocked! I was like, No, God, that was a little bit much.\n\nGiven how much you tangle with this particular administration, why do you think you get called on so much? Have you felt like a target? Yes, I have. But I have to shake that off, because I have to go in and do my job. I cover the White House. I cover all issues, particularly those that affect black and brown Americans. Now, what if they didn\u2019t call on me? A certain segment of America would not get the answers to some of their pressing questions. If I don\u2019t ask, who will?\n\nRyan is the White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks and a political analyst for CNN.

You had to ask whether this president believed slavery was wrong. I recently asked him, \u201cAre you a racist?\u201d It\u2019s a sad day when you have to ask a sitting president that. There has been a series of comments or lack of action, from calling Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas\u201d to how he dealt with Charlottesville to his comments on Norway versus Haiti, Africa, El Salvador, black and brown nations. It\u2019s not been one thing. It\u2019s been a pattern. So I asked. He did not answer, which I thought was a wasted moment. He could have put it to rest right then and there and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a racist.\u201d But it took him days to say that.\n\nYou said it seems as if it has changed, going forward, how the White House deals with the press corps and wields its power. What do you think this means for the next president you cover? He\u2019ll clamp down harder on us. Each president has pushed us further away from access. Who knows what will happen or what another president may want? They may not want to be followed. President Obama didn\u2019t like being followed, for example. This president hates us.

I think the beautiful thing about comics is they do transcend race in a lot of ways.\u201d\n\nMary Dimacali, 29, a social media and marketing manager in Rockland County, New York, echoed that idea. She does not believe that her fianc\u00e9\u2019s 7-year-old son, Sawyer, who is white, sees the film or its characters through the lens of race. Sawyer himself, during the interview with Ms. Dimacali, said, \u201csure,\u201d when she asked if he\u2019d like to dress up as Black Panther.\n\n\u201cFor a white kid to be so open and judge based on the character\u2019s story and the personality and history, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s important,\u201d she said. \u201cBut on the flip side, I think it\u2019s also great to have a black superhero you can identify and connect to.\u201d\n\nThe character\u2019s history is unique. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1966, Black Panther rules as the king of an African technological utopia known as Wakanda.

He is completing \u201cRise of the Black Panther,\u201d a six-part comic series for Marvel that traces the character\u2019s early history. He has tried to explain some of that history to his 7-year-old daughter, but without delving too deeply into complex concepts like Western imperialism, which she may struggle to grasp.\n\n\u201cYou want that white kid to be able to think that he can dress up in a Black Panther costume, because, to that kid, there\u2019s no difference between Captain America and Black Panther,\u201d Mr. Narcisse, 45, said. But, he added, it also involves \u201ctrying to explain what is special about T\u2019Challa and Wakanda without racism.

When they do, they often miss the chance to talk about inequality, even though research supports the idea that children develop an awareness of race and difference at a very young age.\n\nMs. Vittrup was careful to add that dressing as Black Panther isn\u2019t inherently appropriative or offensive. The character comes from an invented African country, and to wear his mask isn\u2019t quite the same as wearing blackface.

Even the clothes are an 18th-century version of current POTUS style: basic black suit and fat tie. As for Washington, he stands blank-faced, one arm extended, like a tenor taking a dignified bow.\n\n[Read remarks from the Obamas and the artists. ]\n\nUninflected dignity was the attitude of choice for well over a century, with a few breaks. In an 1836 portrait, Andrew Jackson, a demonstrative bully, sports a floor-length, red-silk-lined Dracula cloak and a kind of topiary bouffant. (A picture of Jackson, one of President Trump\u2019s populist heroes, hangs in the Oval Office.) Abraham Lincoln, seen in several likenesses, is exceptional for looking as if he may actually have weighty matters on his mind. Most of the portraits that precede and follow his are pure P.R.\n\nThis continues well into the 20th century. In a 1980 painting Jimmy Carter trades a black suit for a beige one. How revolutionary is that? And there\u2019s a Casual Fridays vogue: Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both go tieless for it. Under the circumstances, Elaine de Kooning\u2019s 1963 portrait of John F. Kennedy, a fanfare of green and blue strokes, hits like a boost of adrenaline. Rousing too, though not in a good way, is a big head shot image of Bill Clinton by the artist Chuck Close. Using his signature mosaic-like painting technique, Mr. Close turns the 42nd president into a pixelated clown.\n\nMr. Obama has much better luck with his similarly high-profile portraitist. Mr. Wiley, born in Los Angeles in 1977, gained a following in the early 2000s with his crisp, glossy, life-size paintings of young African-American men dressed in hip-hop styles, but depicted in the old-master manner of European royal portraits. More recently he has expanded his repertoire to include female subjects, as well as models from Brazil, India, Nigeria and Senegal, creating the collective image of a global black aristocracy.\n\nIn an imposingly scaled painting \u2014 just over seven feet tall \u2014 the artist presents Mr. Obama dressed in the regulation black suit and an open-necked white shirt, and seated on a vaguely thronelike chair not so different from the one seen in Stuart\u2019s Washington portrait. But art historical references stop there. So do tonal echoes of past portraits. Whereas Mr. Obama\u2019s predecessors are, to the man, shown expressionless and composed, Mr. Obama sits tensely forward, frowning, elbows on his knees, arms crossed, as if listening hard. No smiles, no Mr. Nice Guy. He\u2019s still troubleshooting, still in the game.\n\nVideo\n\nHis engaged and assertive demeanor contradicts \u2014 and cosmetically corrects \u2014 the impression he often made in office of being philosophically detached from what was going on around him. At some level, all portraits are propaganda, political or personal. And what makes this one distinctive is the personal part. Mr. Wiley has set Mr. Obama against \u2014 really embedded him in \u2014 a bower of what looks like ground cover. From the greenery sprout flowers that have symbolic meaning for the sitter. African blue lilies represent Kenya, his father\u2019s birthplace; jasmine stands for Hawaii, where Mr. Obama himself was born; chrysanthemums, the official flower of Chicago, reference the city where his political career began, and where he met his wife.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMrs. Obama\u2019s choice of Ms. Sherald as an artist was an enterprising one. Ms. Sherald, who was born in Columbus, Ga., in 1973 and lives in Baltimore, is just beginning to move into the national spotlight after putting her career on hold for some years to deal with a family health crisis, and one of her own. (She had a heart transplant at 39.) Production-wise, she and Mr. Wiley operate quite differently. He runs the equivalent of a multinational art factory, with assistants churning out work. Ms. Sherald, who until a few years ago made her living waiting tables, oversees a studio staff of one, herself.\n\nAt the same time, they have much in common. Both focused early on African-American portraiture precisely because it is so little represented in Western art history. And both tend to blend fact and fiction. Mr. Wiley, with photo-realistic precision, casts actual people in fantastically heroic roles. (He modifies his heroizing in the case of Mr. Obama, but it\u2019s still there.) Ms. Sherald also starts with realism, but softens and abstracts it. She gives all her figures gray-toned skin \u2014 a color with ambiguous racial associations \u2014 and reduces bodies to geometric forms silhouetted against single-color fields.\n\nShe shows Mrs. Obama sitting against a field of light blue, wearing a spreading gown. The dress design, by Michelle Smith, is eye-teasingly complicated: mostly white interrupted by black Op Art-ish blips and patches of striped color suggestive of African textiles. The shape of the dress, rising pyramidally upward, mountain-like, feels as if it were the real subject of the portrait. Mrs. Obama\u2019s face forms the composition\u2019s peak, but could be almost anyone\u2019s face, like a model\u2019s face in a fashion spread. To be honest, I was anticipating \u2014 hoping for \u2014 a bolder, more incisive image of the strong-voiced person I imagine this former first lady to be.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m wishing, let me mention something more. Mr. Obama\u2019s portrait will be installed, long-term, among those of his presidential peers, in a dedicated space on the second floor.

While it is true that compared with Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton lost ground with that segment of the electorate, the clues to a new Democratic majority may be found in the coalition that elected Mr. Northam governor of Virginia, or perhaps more accurately, voted against Mr. Gillespie and his immigrant bashing.\n\nIn Virginia, polling data has made it clear that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 rhetoric backfired among minority voters as well as, crucially, among many whites. Mr. Northam won a majority of white college-educated voters, who made up a larger share of the electorate in 2017 than they did in 2016. Mr. Gillespie matched Mr. Trump with noncollege whites, but their turnout was down. And minority voters in 2017 matched their 2016 electorate share \u2014 for the first time ever there was no drop-off from the presidential to the gubernatorial election. The Democrats also expanded their margin of victory in Virginia from five percentage points in 2016 to nine points in 2017.\n\nBefore the vote in Virginia, pundits on both the right and left were speculating that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s anti-immigrant strategy was working. But in the end, election results and polling data in Virginia proved all that thinking was wrong. While each state has its own demographics and distinct politics, Virginia has voters who span demographic and economic spectrums. Majorities of voters of all races and ethnicities rejected anti-immigrant stereotypes as ugly and wrong.\n\nAccording to an election eve survey of voters by Latino Decisions, Latino voters said that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads made them less enthusiastic about him, by a 45-point margin. But it wasn\u2019t just Latino voters. By a 23-point margin (52 to 29), whites in Virginia also said the MS-13 ads turned them away from Mr. Gillespie, as did African-American and Asian-American voters by larger margins.\n\nData speaks louder than punditry, and our regression analysis of survey data paints a clear picture. Exposure to Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads actually helped drive white college-educated voters away from the Republicans. When we analyzed findings for white independents and Republicans, voters who were aware of the MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Mr. Gillespie\u2019s Democratic opponent. What should be alarming for Republicans is that this effect wasn\u2019t limited to the governor\u2019s race. The Gillespie campaign had coattail effects, but of the wrong stripe. Across all racial groups, those who were aware of Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Democratic candidates for Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates.\n\nThis means that not only is it morally just for Democrats to position themselves as the party that stands against hatred and bigotry and in favor of inclusiveness and opportunity, but it is also a strategically sound position for winning votes. Simultaneously, it sends a clear, welcoming message to Latino, African-American and Asian-American voters, while also winning over enough of the white voters who also oppose immigrant bashing.\n\nThis phenomenon is particularly true of voters who will decide crucial House and Senate races in 2018: people of color and white college-educated voters \u2014 also known as the Democratic base. Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans are clearly gearing up for a similar anti-immigrant effort in 2018. But now the mask has been pulled off. Voters get it. Democrats have an opportunity to speak out strongly against bigotry. And in doing so, they have a path to victory in 2018 and beyond.", "keywords": ["democrats", "virginia", "republicans", "immigration", "win", "mr", "ms13", "white", "gillespies", "ads", "voters", "vote"], "polarity": 0.10965551203646441, "subjectivity": 0.4705427288760622},

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nYet, despite the obvious truth of that statement, we may wonder: What are the moral and political arguments that underwrite the claim that black lives matter? While there is no way to articulate the full scope of those arguments in a single essay, it\u2019s worth considering the philosophical contributions of some of the forerunners of the movement that is our most urgent manifestation of black thought today.\n\nThe end of the Civil War and the subsequent ratification of the 13th Amendment in 1865 legally abolished slavery, but blacks quickly became subject to a displaced form of violence at the hands of white supremacists across the nation who typically used false accusations of sexual assault to justify lynching black men. Police turned a blind eye to these murders, and sometimes actively facilitated them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIda B. Wells, a leading black thinker and journalist in the late-19th and early 20th centuries, and a co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, built a public career documenting lynchings and calling America to account for them. Her arguments extended and amplified those made by Frederick Douglass before her. Douglass\u2019s central claim in his seminal \u201cThe Meaning of July Fourth for the Negro\u201d was that Americans should feel shame for slavery, given their country\u2019s foundational commitment to liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We were failing our own ideals.\n\nWells pointed to the rise of lynching after the fall of slavery as not merely a legal matter to be rectified with new laws. Having fled her hometown to escape threats of her own lynching, Wells used the press to make her moral arguments. She described a nation in the grip of a dark remorse for freeing black Americans from slavery, and condemned white Americans for cruelties that violated their own commitment to the democratic project.\n\nThe horrors that Wells described were a factor in the Great Migration of blacks to the North, which fed the flourishing of black thought and cultural life that gave rise to the Harlem Renaissance. An indication that the Harlem Renaissance was always meant to be a period of radical black philosophy and social change was the name originally coined for the movement: The New Negro. Alain Locke, the Harvard-educated black intellectual who became known as the father of the Harlem Renaissance, envisioned a philosophical position that reinvigorated blacks\u2019 relationship to their culture and that would in turn solidify their status as equal co-participants in our democracy.\n\nA strong theme among some of the luminaries of the time focused on the will of blacks to assert their humanity against racism and to insist on their status as persons owed respect. Among those stars, the poet Langston Hughes was one of the brightest. His \u201cI Too\u201d is a quiet yet insistent poem depicting a black man employed by a white one and his struggle with invisibility. The protagonist resolves to sit at the table with the white folks the next day and show people how beautiful he is and that he, too, is America. The writer Zora Neale Hurston had an equally persistent but at times more playful take on the matter. In her essay \u201cHow It Feels to Be Colored Me,\u201d she wrote, \u201cSometimes, I feel discriminated against, but it does not make me angry. It merely astonishes me. How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company! It\u2019s beyond me.\u201d\n\nThinkers like Hughes and Hurston were involved in the Harlem Renaissance project of presenting a vision of black cultural vitality and worth that would rework the image of black Americans that whites typically relied upon. That stream of thought runs directly into the heart of Black Lives Matter.\n\nAnother valuable and necessary development to come out of the Black Lives Matter movement is the de-emphasizing of black patriarchy and the equal acknowledgment of the suffering of black women and the black L.G.T.B.Q. community. Though sexuality was an avenue of inquiry during the Harlem Renaissance, it was perhaps the mid- to late-20th century poet and theorist Audre Lorde who did the most to make black women\u2019s sexuality a focal point of political and social philosophy.\n\nWhile today \u201cintersectionality\u201d is bandied about as the cutting edge of social research, it was Lorde who in her writing insisted on complicating our view of personal identity by claiming that each of us belongs to multiple identity communities, all of which contribute to our sense of self and our purposes.\n\nShe also showed the broad reach of white supremacy and its effects on black Americans as they located themselves in more nuanced ways in the tapestry of American culture. For her, the primary form taken by resistance to racism was the denial of blunt categories imposed on black Americans, which stifled the possibility of an individual\u2019s full flourishing. Lorde, then, called for a radical form of self-possession whose boundaries were not open to negotiation with a white society.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen people think of Black Lives Matter, they often think of anger feeding forceful protests. Anger is a reasonable response to racial injustice. To be certain, groups like the Black Panthers and thinkers like Malcolm X advised black Americans to get angry and take the doctrine of armed self-defense seriously. Though anger and love are not mutually exclusive emotions, James Baldwin and Martin Luther King Jr. affirmed a view of civic love to pre-empt the need for violence.\n\nKing espoused a form of Kantian regard that prioritized conceiving of every human, racist or not, as owed a kind of love that is grounded in the ideal of universal respect. Baldwin held a slightly different view. He felt black Americans ought to see whites as democratic kin or family, as people with whom blacks would have serious quarrels but also people whom it would be worth keeping close in order to strengthen and bring integrity to the bonds of shared democratic life. These two views of love eschewed violence yet insisted on militancy. While forgiveness and acceptance were hallmarks of King\u2019s and Baldwin\u2019s views, so was an unyielding commitment to self-respect and the demand for social change to institutionalize the idea that blacks were co-creators of the American kingdom.\n\nThinkers like Wells, Hughes, Hurston, Lorde and Baldwin not only anticipated the current Black Lives Matter movement but provided an intellectual blueprint to give depth and integrity to that slogan, so that its meaning transcends the demand to stop police brutality. It is a demand for whites to extend their historical imagination and recognize that the ills of racism are not the result of a few bad police officers or a few out-and-out racists in some far-off corner of America. The problem, rather, is a kind of complicity \u2014 one partaking in the false comfort that America has somehow escaped the trajectory of its racially murderous history. It is necessary that we to see our society today as continuous with that history and not anomalous to it.\n\nBlack thought\u2019s primary contribution to the academy and to American society is the richness and precision with which it describes our worst demons to us, while offering a vision of how we might each save our democracy from the ruin of irrational fear and hatred.", "keywords": ["america", "americans", "movement", "blacks", "white", "harlem", "lives", "showed", "black", "renaissance", "matter"], "polarity": 0.043612258953168, "subjectivity": 0.3973699190419967},

When the pair started working together in the mid-80s, Mr. Bell was sought after by political leaders and corporations who wanted some of the communications magic he had provided to Mrs. Thatcher.\n\nBell Pottinger quickly had hundreds of clients, a few of them infamous. Mr. Bell attributes his ability to work with virtually anyone to innate optimism.\n\n\u201cI see the good in people,\u201d he said.\n\nThis included Chile\u2019s former dictator Augusto Pinochet. Mr. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain in 1998 as part of an effort to deport him to Spain, where he had been indicted on a charge of torturing Spanish citizens.\n\nAfter two years of legal and political wrangling, Mr. Bell and his allies prevailed when Mr. Pinochet was authorized to freely return to Chile.\n\nBell Pottinger was hardly the only British outfit working for rogues and despots, as well as publicly traded companies, nor was it the largest or most profitable. But it had a buccaneering spirit that made it the firm of choice for a wide variety of missions.\n\n\n\nDuring the war in Iraq, Bell Pottinger had a contract with the Pentagon to produce propaganda for the United States military. This included scripts in Arabic for a soap opera that aired in the country, said Mr. Bell.\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen the company\u2019s client list did not generate news, its methods did. In 2011, it was caught boasting about its skills in the dark arts of search engine manipulation to people it thought were potential clients.\n\nIn fact, they were undercover members of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit organization that works with a variety of media. Posing as executives from the made-up Azimov Group, these \u201crepresentatives\u201d said the company had ties to the Uzbekistan regime, which has been criticized for repression and for using forced child labor during its cotton harvest.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Azimov executives said they worried about blowback.\n\nFret not, said Tim Collins, a Bell Pottinger managing director, per transcripts published by The Independent, a British newspaper. After the company applied its tech wizardry, \u201cYou get to the point where even if they type in \u2018Uzbek child labour\u2019 or \u2018Uzbek human rights violation,\u2019 some of the first results that come up are sites talking about what you guys are doing to address and improve that, not just the critical voices saying how terrible this all is.\u201d\n\nMr. Bell never challenged the transcripts, but he denounced the sting at the time as an \u201cunethical, underhand deception to manufacture a story where none exists.\u201d\n\nBeginning of the End\n\nBell Pottinger\u2019s slide into oblivion began with a visit to the Guptas in January 2016. Mr. Bell, who had worked in South Africa for years, said he had no idea what the brothers wanted, but he and several colleagues flew to Johannesburg to find out.\n\n\u201cWe went to this bloody great mansion, which seemed to be their headquarters,\u201d Mr. Bell recalled. \u201cGreat big room, huge sofas all over the place. Servants. Appalling, all of it.\u201d\n\nThe family already had a fortune, Tony Gupta told the small entourage. Now, he and his brothers wanted to help poor blacks. To that end, they wanted a P.R. campaign that pushed the idea of economic emancipation.\n\n\u201cSo we went back to London and wrote a strategy,\u201d said Mr. Bell. \u201cTown hall meetings, marching in the street, that kind of thing. Draw attention to the economic imbalance, then tell people they should protest and demand change.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe company drafted a two-page proposal, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times. Among its recommendations was \u201ca non-party political narrative around the existence of economic apartheid\u201d that Bell Pottinger would package \u201cinto speeches, news releases, website content, videos/broadcast content, slogans and other material required.\u201d\n\nSoon, the Guptas said that their company needed communications help, too. Most South Africans, the Guptas maintained, had an inflated notion of how much of the family\u2019s revenue came from government contracts, which harmed their interests, several Bell Pottinger employees recalled.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe corporate campaign was the first sign that altruism had little to do with the \u00a3100,000 a month that Bell Pottinger would earn during what was initially a three-month project. The second was the anger of the company\u2019s other South Africa clients when they learned of the arrangement.\n\nThe billionaire Johann Rupert was aghast to suddenly find himself one of the most prominent examples of \u201cwhite monopoly capital.\u201d He texted Mr. Bell and asked how his P.R. firm could also be working for a family that was bashing him. Mr. Bell, by his own account, quickly lost enthusiasm for the Gupta project.\n\n\u201cIt was altogether smelly,\u201d he said of the racial element of the work. But he quickly added that ethics were not the issue. If enough South African clients quit Bell Pottinger, he reasoned, the losses would outweigh the Guptas\u2019s checks. \u201cI was saying it\u2019s not a commercially sensible thing to do.\u201d\n\nBut by the end of March, only one client \u2014 the banking and asset management company Investec \u2014 had severed ties with the P.R. firm. After that, Bell Pottinger tried to find middle ground by signing a new contract with the Guptas, this time with a codicil literally called an anti-embarrassment clause. It allowed the firm to terminate the account \u201cwithout notice\u201d if the brothers brought discredit to the business.\n\nMr. Bell said he soon resolved to quit the company because he felt undermined and undervalued by Mr. Henderson. \u201cHe made my life a misery from start to finish,\u201d said Mr. Bell, speaking one recent afternoon in the living room of his home near London\u2019s Sloane Square. After negotiating a \u00a33.5 million exit package, Mr. Bell resigned in August 2016.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor his part, Mr. Henderson declined in a recent interview to indulge in the put-downs that come so easily to his antagonist. Seated at a conference table in temporary offices in Mayfair, where he is starting a new P.R. firm, he said Bell Pottinger\u2019s dissolution was too recent to discuss.\n\n\u201cI have huge empathy for all those impacted,\u201d he said, \u201cand believe now is not the appropriate time to go into details.\u201d\n\nInflaming Tensions\n\nThe P.R. campaign in South Africa, which started in 2016, was intended to raise the temperature of race relations. And it worked.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore than 100 fake Twitter accounts were created, all of them retweeting content from other Twitter accounts with names like @economycapture, according to media reports. Popular hashtags included #WhiteMonopolyCapital and #RespectGuptas. The campaign involved some 220,000 tweets.\n\nThere were also attack website with names like WMC Leaks and WMC Scams. Another part of this ecosystem were mainstream media outlets owned by the Guptas, like ANN7, a 24-hour news channel, and The New Age, a daily newspaper.\n\nAs the campaign spread, leaders at groups like the A.N.C. Youth League gave inflammatory speeches, decrying the \u201cstranglehold\u201d that rich whites had on the economy. Leaked emails would later show that the groups received media training, and in some cases funds, from Oakbay.\n\nAn atmosphere of menace slowly pervaded the country. In July 2016, the police minister announced the creation of a task force to investigate the murder of more than a dozen political figures. In the run-up to municipal elections that year, Mr. Zuma described the Democratic Alliance, the A.N.C.\u2019s main rival, as a \u201cwhite party,\u201d adding that it could not \u201crun this country no matter how they cover up by getting a few black stooges.\u201d\n\nNew and radical groups like Black First Land First sprang up, holding public rallies to fulminate against whites. At one, in May 2016, a pastor named Xola Skosana told the crowd, \u201cWe have been wounded beyond measure. Let us find the pillars and bring the house down. Black people must be avenged.\u201d\n\nFor the first time in years, whites felt a rising sense of personal danger. Nicholas Wolpe, a white South African whose father was a pioneer of the anti-apartheid movement, remembers a palpable anxiety. \u201cThere was a shift toward intolerance,\u201d he said. \u201cGradually, the debate about white monopoly capital was everywhere and the people talking about it were loud and belligerent. It struck a nerve.\u201d\n\nIn a related and surreptitious campaign, the Guptas were being recast as warmhearted people eager to help the downtrodden. A website connected to Black First Land First ran editorials defending the brothers, suggesting in one that they should be \u201cpraised for saving jobs.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["firm", "pottinger", "south", "bell", "end", "guptas", "company", "mr", "met", "main", "africa", "reading", "campaign", "pr", "despots", "rogues"], "polarity": 0.05728090899659527, "subjectivity": 0.3829289628309236},

Often, this work is done by women who are later overlooked; in the case of the civil rights struggle, for instance, women like Jo Ann Robinson and Georgia Gilmore fund-raised for and organized the Montgomery bus boycott.

Just as Ms. Robinson and Ms. Gilmore led the 1955-56 boycott of buses in Alabama, in the 1970s, women like Louise Day Hicks led the antibusing crusades in the North, in an effort to avoid the desegregation of Boston public schools. While men debated in legislative chambers and listened to challenges on the bench, women headed to school cafeterias, playgrounds and PTA meetings, doing the bulk of the behind-the-scenes work of supporting the politics of segregation.\n\nWhite women organized precinct gatherings to pressure their politicians to uphold Jim Crow laws. They transformed their homes into centers of bureaucratic efficiency \u2014 copying fliers, assigning neighborhoods for petition drives and scheduling protest shifts at elementary schools and bus garages.\n\nIt was also women who shaped the way segregation, white supremacy and ideas about racial identity were knitted into the fabric of their communities. Working as midwives, teachers and social workers, women policed the racial identity of babies, students and clients to ensure that the dividing line between white and black remained intact. And across the nation, women-led groups like Patriotic American Youth and the Women for Constitutional Government and Pro America spread the message to the next generation that opposition to racial equality was about states\u2019 rights and limited government, not white supremacy.\n\nIf narratives about white supremacy have been shaped by the overwhelmingly masculine lens through which we examine practically all political movements, there are also aspects of white supremacy that make it different. One critical factor here is the central role ascribed to white male sexual and status anxiety and lust for dominance in fomenting organized white-supremacist activities. As part of arguments against desegregation, many who belonged to these movements embraced a narrative that saw white women and girls as vulnerable (to black men), and white men as protectors \u2014 a story line that simultaneously elevated white men and rendered women helpmates and beneficiaries, not activists.\n\nBut this broader narrative obscures and even gives cover to the ways white women sometimes used white supremacy for their own gain. The suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt in the early 20th century argued for women\u2019s voting rights in Southern states on the basis that \u201cwhite supremacy will be strengthened, not weakened, by white women\u2019s suffrage.\u201d In the 1920s, the journalist Nell Battle Lewis of North Carolina never questioned the absolute need for racial segregation even as she criticized the violence committed in the name of Jim Crow. Staying in the racial fold, she was afforded the opportunity to blast her state\u2019s regressive labor and gender politics. Being a white supremacist, even a liberal one, meant that she remained part of the conversation.\n\nThe point, here, is neither to catalog nor to celebrate white women\u2019s contributions to white supremacist politics. Instead, their work should change how we understand history. It is easy to denounce the racist pronouncements and white-supremacist politics of a George Wallace or a Roy Moore. But what white women teach us is that white-supremacist politics is sustained at a much more grass-roots level by our neighbors, school boards and even friends. White women have made white supremacy a much more formidable and long-lasting force in American society, sustaining it at both the local and national levels.\n\nToday, it seems, the story America prefers to tell itself about white supremacy has changed little since the middle of the century: Instead of Klan lynchings, we focus on the rally in Charlottesville; instead of George Wallace, we focus on Jeff Sessions or, for that matter, Donald Trump. Outrage over the violence and rhetoric of these men buries an equally important and certainly more intransigent story of longstanding grass-roots and national campaigns populated partly by white women who aim to maintain racial and economic inequities on the American landscape. If we begin to consider their staying power with seriousness rather than surprise \u2014 a surprise not shared by black women \u2014 perhaps we can more effectively prepare to counter this strand of American politics.", "keywords": ["whitesupremacist", "racial", "american", "power", "womens", "women", "politics", "white", "men", "work", "supremacy"], "polarity": 0.08455011423761423, "subjectivity": 0.23956078643578646},

But a new analysis from the Center for New York City Affairs at the New School takes a closer look by mapping the achievement gaps within each public elementary school in New York City. The results reveal the challenges of integrating students across the system, and of integrating under one roof.\n\nThe study is a snapshot that looks at student performance on a single test, the state math assessment given in 2016 to third through fifth graders. At each school, it looks at the race of the test takers and estimates their household income using census information about where they live.\n\nThe report illustrates how closely race, income and academic performance are tied in this city. Almost all students in the study with estimated household incomes below $30,000 were black or Hispanic, while students with household incomes above $80,000 were predominantly white. And the poorer students were, the lower they tended to score on the test, even when they went to the same school as wealthier children.\n\nTake P.S. 8, the Robert Fulton school in Brooklyn Heights, which the Center for American Progress identified last year as having one of the richest Parent Teacher Associations in the country, and which has a relatively diverse student body. While 64 percent of its students passed the state math test in 2016, compared with 36 percent of students citywide, black students at the school were nearly a full proficiency level behind their white peers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBlack students at the school also had significantly lower estimated incomes than white students.\n\nNicole Mader, the co-author of the study, said the lingering achievement gap demonstrates that just having different kinds of students together in the same building is not enough to have true integration. Students must be in the same classrooms, have the same quality of teachers and be disciplined in the same way.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The queens scrambled to get ready, gluing down their eyebrows and predicting the bottom three. How fun, with everyone in earshot!

In the bottom: Aja, whose three-wigged Kawaii look was the best of the night but didn\u2019t redeem her failed Needy Girl performance; mod-clad Milk, deservedly dragged for her one-note Psycho (if only they\u2019d seen the workroom footage); and Chi Chi, lovely on the runway but overshadowed in the challenge. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Chi Chi tearfully told the judges, admitting the other queens\u2019 skills made her question her worth.\n\n\u201cChi Chi, you\u2019re worth it,\u201d the guest judge and pop-up life coach Constance Zimmer said.\n\nThe top two? BenDeLaCreme, for the third week in a row, and Kennedy, who announced backstage that she would forgo one-on-one appeals and decide who to eliminate on her own terms. BenDeLaCreme still kept office hours, though. Aja stopped by, knowing full well she wasn\u2019t going home \u2014 three wigs.

The queens lip-synced to cloyingly impersonated covers of RuPaul\u2019s greatest hits \u2014 you know VH1 can afford 40 seconds of \u201cNasty,\u201d so this move felt particularly cynical \u2014 followed by a \u201cRudemption\u201d runway, where they spruced up disastrous looks from their previous stints on the show.\n\nIn the top were BenDeLaCreme, who rapped cheekily as Julie Andrews; BeBe Zahara Benet, who nailed Diana Ross; and Shangela, who hammed up Mariah Carey and strutted the runway in a giant, rolling bubble. In the bottom: Kennedy Davenport, who lip-synced messily; Thorgy, who, surprise, didn\u2019t quite commit; and, for reasons unclear to me, Chi Chi, who put across a great Patti LaBelle and wore a shapely runway outfit, after repeated criticism from the Season 8 judges for not wearing padding.

Not really, but the producers were clearly carving a narrative. Milk, on the other hand, was safe somehow, despite a snoozy-glam runway outing and, in the Divas Live challenge, bearing no resemblance whatsoever to Celine Dion. Backstage, she behaved ru-diculously, crying and cursing, while the others rubbernecked in bemused shock. \u201cI was in character the entire time and to not be commended for it, it\u2019s stupid,\u201d Milk said. \u201cI hate this.\u201d (I mean, they know this is going to be on television, right?)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBenDeLaCreme and Shangela were named top two and faced off in a lip-sync to The Pointer Sisters\u2019 \u201cJump (For My Love).\u201d BenDeLaCreme unzipped to a second look mid-song, but Shangela whipped out a jump rope and victory was hers, as was the task of eliminating either Kennedy or Thorgy, who\u2019d continued to grouse backstage and angle for alliances.

They acknowledge and internalize this in their confessionals, which are filmed in the nearby meadow. It is not boring TV.\n\nRuPaul popped on the workroom television to, yet again, coo ominous reassurances to Thorgy, while previous winners (and RuPaul handmaids) Chad Michaels and Alaska stalked up behind her.\n\nWhen Thorgy inevitably returns, will she be chastened?

So was BeBe, luscious in monochromatic dark blossoms. BenDeLaCreme, covered in orchids and shimmering butterflies, was named top two for the fourth week in a row. She was joined by Shangela, done up in a nod to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s floral-wreathed pregnancy announcement photo.\n\nIn the bottom: the inconsistent Kennedy, who was last week\u2019s winner; Chi Chi, lovely in lilies but adrift in the challenge; and a kaleidoscopically effloresced Trixie, who cried while the camera zoomed in.\n\n\u201cI get nervous here,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m at Camp Crystal Lake and Jason\u2019s outside with the machete.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget what you have, and what you offer, and who you are, whether this continues or not,\u201d Ms. Chenoweth said.

She\u2019s gifted, perhaps just not at \u201cDrag Race.\u201d\n\nShangela, on the other hand, was born for this, holding court in yet another confessional. \u201cThis is the \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 of drag,\u201d she said, refusing to let an episode go by without making that comparison. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have alliances.

The queens were assigned divas to impersonate \u2014 Trixie Mattel got Dolly Parton; Aja, Amy Winehouse; Thorgy Thor, Stevie Nicks \u2014 pairings that felt surprisingly considerate of each queen\u2019s strengths.\n\nThorgy, who admitted Ms. Nicks was one of her biggest inspirations, nevertheless bristled. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be a conspiracy theorist, because that\u2019s what I was in Season 8,\u201d she said, before launching into a conspiracy theory: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m being set up to fail. Next to Diana Ross and Janet Jackson, she is not like, \u2018Werk!\u2019 It just doesn\u2019t feel fair.\u201d\n\nFirst off, Stevie Nicks said on \u201cOprah\u2019s Master Class\u201d that she carried a gram of cocaine in her boot for years, like a Laurel Canyon Mary Poppins; that\u2019s drama. Second, the whole point of \u201cAll Stars\u201d is to exhibit growth where you once fell short, so for the love of God, wait a little longer than Episode 2 before putting on the tinfoil hat.\n\nAssigned Celine Dion, Milk revealed she\u2019d impersonated her once before, to great acclaim from Ms. Dion\u2019s wedding planner, who happened to be in the audience. \u201cHe was like, \u2018Oh my god, that was the best Celine,\u2019\u201d Milk boasted, adding that, for this challenge, she\u2019d decided to replicate a Versace dress and black spiky hair Ms. Dion wore to the most recent Met Gala.\n\n\u201cDo you think anybody\u2019s going to recognize that?\u201d BenDeLaCreme asked. Milk shrugged this off. (Girl, that was your lifeboat and you didn\u2019t get on it.)\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThe \u201cDivas Live\u201d show, choreographed by the peddler of prolonged eye contact Todrick Hall, was a mixed bag. The queens lip-synced to cloyingly impersonated covers of RuPaul\u2019s greatest hits \u2014 you know VH1 can afford 40 seconds of \u201cNasty,\u201d so this move felt particularly cynical \u2014 followed by a \u201cRudemption\u201d runway, where they spruced up disastrous looks from their previous stints on the show.\n\nIn the top were BenDeLaCreme, who rapped cheekily as Julie Andrews; BeBe Zahara Benet, who nailed Diana Ross; and Shangela, who hammed up Mariah Carey and strutted the runway in a giant, rolling bubble. In the bottom: Kennedy Davenport, who lip-synced messily; Thorgy, who, surprise, didn\u2019t quite commit; and, for reasons unclear to me, Chi Chi, who put across a great Patti LaBelle and wore a shapely runway outfit, after repeated criticism from the Season 8 judges for not wearing padding. (\u201cI just loved you in \u2018Eraser,\u2019\u201d Chi Chi gushed to guest judge Vanessa Williams. \u201c\u2018Eraser,\u2019 baby, \u2018Eraser.\u201d\u201d)\n\nDid Thorgy deserve a bottom spot as well? Not really, but the producers were clearly carving a narrative. Milk, on the other hand, was safe somehow, despite a snoozy-glam runway outing and, in the Divas Live challenge, bearing no resemblance whatsoever to Celine Dion. Backstage, she behaved ru-diculously, crying and cursing, while the others rubbernecked in bemused shock. \u201cI was in character the entire time and to not be commended for it, it\u2019s stupid,\u201d Milk said. \u201cI hate this.\u201d (I mean, they know this is going to be on television, right?)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBenDeLaCreme and Shangela were named top two and faced off in a lip-sync to The Pointer Sisters\u2019 \u201cJump (For My Love).\u201d BenDeLaCreme unzipped to a second look mid-song, but Shangela whipped out a jump rope and victory was hers, as was the task of eliminating either Kennedy or Thorgy, who\u2019d continued to grouse backstage and angle for alliances. No dice: Shangela axed her.\n\n\u201cGross,\u201d Thorgy said. \u201cHave a good time without me,\u201d she added in the workroom, packing up. \u201cBye, it\u2019s going to be boring TV.\u201d\n\nTruly, get out. Also, you know, I hate to be a broken record, but there\u2019s this show with amateur British bakers, and if their meringues curdle it\u2019s no one\u2019s fault but theirs, for not watching them more closely. They acknowledge and internalize this in their confessionals, which are filmed in the nearby meadow. It is not boring TV.\n\nRuPaul popped on the workroom television to, yet again, coo ominous reassurances to Thorgy, while previous winners (and RuPaul handmaids) Chad Michaels and Alaska stalked up behind her.\n\nWhen Thorgy inevitably returns, will she be chastened? Will Milk continue to sour? Was that actually Celine Dion\u2019s wedding planner?

Particularly strong were Aja, who leapt from a platform into a frisson-inducing death-drop; Shangela, who lip-synced and danced with verve; and Trixie, who sang and played the autoharp. BeBe and Milk, who also lip-synced, and Thorgy, who played the violin, avoided both elimination and triumph. BenDeLaCreme, doing daffy burlesque, was named top two with Aja, and they squared off in a spirited lip-sync to Nicki Minaj\u2019s \u201cAnaconda.\u201d BenDeLaCreme\u2019s playful take gave her the edge, and she emerged victorious.\n\n\u201cWith great power comes great responsibility,\u201d RuPaul intoned, tasking BenDeLaCreme with cutting one of bottom two: Chi Chi, who twirled a baton in jazz flats (the judge Michelle Visage\u2019s face visibly dropped), and Morgan, who lip-synced too tentatively to an original song that, quite frankly, could\u2019ve used Fred Ebb on lyrics.\n\nMorgan was swiftly eliminated, but I doubt that\u2019s the last we\u2019ll see of her. The gods may not reward hubris, but Reddit certainly does, and America is gagged for subterfuge. (Give me deferential British home-bakers any day.)\n\n\u201cBlessed be, kitty girl, I\u2019ve got your back,\u201d RuPaul cackled from a television in the workroom as Morgan gathered her things.
