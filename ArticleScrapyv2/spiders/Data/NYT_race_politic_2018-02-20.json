In the talks, the officials say, Mr. Kushner has insisted that he maintain his current level of access, including the ability to review the daily intelligence briefing when he sees fit.\n\nBut Mr. Kelly, who has been privately dismissive of Mr. Kushner since taking the post of chief of staff but has rarely taken him on directly, has made no guarantees, saying only that the president\u2019s son-in-law will still have all the access he needs to do his job under the new system.\n\n\u201cAs I told Jared days ago, I have full confidence in his ability to continue performing his duties in his foreign policy portfolio including overseeing our Israeli-Palestinian peace effort and serving as an integral part of our relationship with Mexico,\u201d Mr. Kelly said in a statement the White House released on Tuesday in which he refused to address Mr. Kushner\u2019s security clearance or elaborate on his memo.\n\n\u201cEveryone in the White House is grateful for these valuable contributions to furthering the president\u2019s agenda,\u201d Mr. Kelly said of Mr. Kushner. \u201cThere is no truth to any suggestion otherwise.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear whether Mr. Kushner would need to review highly classified information. His current portfolio \u2014 which includes acting as an intermediary with Mexico, trying to forge Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, participating in an economic dialogue with China and working on revising the North American Free Trade Agreement \u2014 seems unlikely to involve major intelligence or national security secrets. But Mr. Kushner, by dint of his relationship with Mr. Trump, has wide-ranging access to the president and the information that he sees, and senior advisers to the president typically require such access to perform their duties.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

However, since Mr. Porter\u2019s departure, one official said, Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump have told people around the White House that they have been vocal in their attempts to defend Mr. Kelly but are being treated unfairly in return.\n\nOne person familiar with Mr. Kushner\u2019s thinking, who insisted on anonymity to describe it, denied that he felt personally targeted by Mr. Kelly or was agitating to have him removed. Another White House official denied that Mr. Kushner had ever raised the issue of the intelligence summary in his discussions with Mr. Kelly over his clearance.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the memo, deliberately or otherwise, has shone an unflattering light on Mr. Kushner, raising questions about whether he can be effective in his post and how much authority he has. That debate threatens to complicate what Mr. Kelly has acknowledged is a long-overdue effort inside the White House to get a handle on the clearance process, a national security imperative over which top officials appear to have placed little priority after Mr. Trump took office.\n\n\u201cWe should \u2014 and in the future, must \u2014 do better,\u201d Mr. Kelly said in his memo last week.\n\nThe questions surrounding Mr. Kushner\u2019s clearance are particularly acute because of the possibility that his extensive contacts with foreign actors \u2014 including travel, meetings with leaders overseas and multiple business ventures \u2014 might be relevant to the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nMr. Kushner initially failed to disclose scores of those contacts on the standard form required for all prospective government officials, and has since amended his submission, substantially delaying his background check.\n\nThat meant that his background information was not submitted in its entirety until June, after the June 1 cutoff that Mr. Kelly set in his memo.\n\nUnder the new policy, anyone holding interim clearance to see top secret or sensitive compartmented information whose background investigation had been pending since then is to be stripped of that access by Friday. Even if Mr. Kushner was not in that initial group, the document suggested that his status would soon be reviewed, and that his access going forward would be subject entirely to Mr. Kelly\u2019s discretion.\n\n\u201cSimilar reviews will occur monthly for long-outstanding adjudications,\u201d Mr. Kelly wrote. The new rules, he said, would \u201climit access to certain highly classified information for those individuals working with interim clearance status absent explicit chief of staff\u2019s office approval, which would be granted only in the most compelling circumstances.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["information", "kushner", "tackles", "house", "kelly", "issues", "mr", "white", "access", "trump", "clearance", "resists", "losing", "security"], "polarity": 0.08080592567605555, "subjectivity": 0.38820796087029846},

But policymakers don\u2019t agree on what a leave plan should look like. Now some Republicans have a new idea: Let people collect Social Security benefits early to pay for time off after they have a baby.\n\nUnlike some other proposals, this would require no new taxes. There\u2019s a catch, though: Parents would have their Social Security benefits delayed when they retire to offset the costs.\n\nSocial Security has long been viewed as an untouchable part of the social safety net. By letting people tap it for parental leave, it would begin to feel more like an individual account \u2014 an idea conservatives have been trying to advance for decades.\n\nImage Senator Joni Ernst said she supported the idea because it would provide an option for new mothers who might otherwise leave the work force. Credit Eric Thayer for The New York Times\n\nThe new parental leave plan comes from a right-leaning group called the Independent Women\u2019s Forum, and its president, Carrie Lukas, who said Social Security was based on an antiquated idea of working life. \u201cWomen are a bigger part of the work force now, and they need support at different times of their lives rather than just starting at 67,\u201d she said.\n\nMore broadly, Ms. Lukas has said that she hoped the proposal would \u201cencourage an important mental shift\u201d in the way people think about Social Security. If individuals view it as \u201cproperty,\u201d she reasons, it could lead to the embrace of personal accounts.\n\nThat reasoning is why some experts view the proposal as a backdoor way to try to curb the scale and cost of Social Security. They also said it could put women in a more precarious position in retirement, adding yet another financial penalty to the list that women pay when they become mothers. Women have lower earnings, smaller Social Security benefits and less financial security in retirement because they spend a disproportionate amount of time away from work to raise children, research shows. Drawing down their Social Security benefits early could compound the problem.\n\n\u201cHere you have a situation where women live longer, but they tend to live both sicker and poorer because of the caregiving they do,\u201d said Debra Ness, president of the National Partnership for Women & Families, a nonprofit that champions women\u2019s economic security. \u201cWith this proposal, we would be asking them to borrow against the already inadequate support they receive from Social Security.\u201d\n\nSenator Joni Ernst of Iowa, a supporter of the idea, said it would provide women with more financial security by encouraging them to stay in the work force after they have children. \u201cI think about those women that will leave the work force because that\u2019s their only option, and this provides them a way to take some time off, spend time devoted to their family and then return,\u201d she said.\n\nThe new proposal is one of several being considered by Ivanka Trump and others in the White House to expand paid leave beyond the 13 percent of workers who have access to it through their employers.\n\nThey are studying if the Social Security Administration can be used to administer paid leave, according to people briefed on their discussions. It could allow people to collect payments early, as in the plan Ms. Ernst spoke of, or it could administer a new fund, perhaps financed by payroll taxes, an idea some Democrats have proposed. The administration\u2019s goal is to get bipartisan support on what has historically not been a Republican issue.\n\nThree Republican senators \u2014 Ms. Ernst, Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah \u2014 announced this month that they supported the Social Security proposal, though they were still researching it and had not yet started writing a bill.\n\nImage Senator Marco Rubio, left, and Senator Mike Lee also support the proposal, although Mr. Lee voiced concern about the future of Social Security. Credit T.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York Times\n\nIn a conference call, the senators praised the fact that the plan would not force businesses to provide leave, would not start a new government program and would not raise taxes.\n\nBut Mr. Lee also raised concerns about the underfunding of Social Security, and whether this would accelerate its decline. That is the most controversial aspec t of the proposal, experts said, because it would apply more stress to a program that is already under pressure.\n\nStarting in 2034, Social Security will be able to pay only 75 percent of scheduled benefits, according to the latest trustees report, unless taxes are raised or benefits are trimmed. And while the chances of passing any legislation in an election year are dim, the proposal introduces a new strain of thinking about what Social Security can be used for. Another legislator, Representative Thomas Garrett, a Republican from Virginia, recently introduced a bill that would let individuals draw Social Security benefits early to pay off a portion of their student loans.\n\nMillions of retirees rely on modest checks from the program, which was created from a bill signed into law by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935. Treating Social Security as something that can be borrowed against suggests that it can be treated as an individual account rather than a social insurance program. That could open the door to privatizing the accounts, some experts said, an idea that was floated during George W. Bush\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cThis is a significant philosophy shift that doesn\u2019t look at it like an insurance program where we are all in it together, but an individual asset you can tap to pay for your individual needs,\u201d said Kathleen Romig, senior policy analyst at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nThe proposal would also begin to reshape Social Security into something more akin to 401(k) accounts: Account holders can borrow against their 401(k), or even drain it in a financial emergency (albeit with a penalty), leaving them with less savings for retirement.\n\nSocial Security, in contrast, cannot be touched and is often viewed as the last standing leg in the three-legged stool of retirement, when personal savings are not enough and pensions are increasingly rare.\n\nTo be eligible for the proposed program, a new parent would need to have a minimum amount of earnings in the years before claiming the benefit, similar to the formula used to qualify for Social Security disability benefits , according to the proposal from the Independent Women\u2019s Forum.\n\nThe size of the benefit would be calculated borrowing a formula from Social Security. A 26-year-old woman earning $31,000, for example, might receive roughly $1,175 a month in Social Security parental benefits, which replaces about 45 percent of her income, for up to 12 weeks.\n\nThe cost would come later, in the form of a reduced retirement benefit. Exactly how the reduction would be calculated is not yet entirely clear, said Andrew Biggs, a former principal deputy commissioner of the Social Security Administration who helped devise the proposal and who is now at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. But roughly speaking, he said, a 12-week leave would most likely translate to a benefit cut of 1.5 percent.\n\nThe proposal says that a parent\u2019s Social Security check would be delayed, not cut, to offset the amount gained during the paid leave.\n\nMs. Lukas said that delaying Social Security would not be a problem for most people: \u201cSixty-seven is really late middle age, and many people are really happy to continue working.\u201d\n\nYet many workers do not have a choice. And while life expectancies have increased, better-paid and more educated people tend to live longer than those who earn less.\n\nAs of now, the proposal covers new parents but not workers who are recovering from an illness or need to care for other family members. It also does not provide job security for people who take leave. The Family and Medical Leave Act does both those things, but the leave is unpaid, and only about half of workers qualify for it.\n\nThe Family Act, a bill sponsored in the Senate by Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, would create a new fund within the Social Security Administration. Employers and employees would each contribute 0.2 percent of their wages for 12 weeks of paid parental, family or medical leave.\n\nRepublicans generally object to proposals that would raise taxes, but any paid leave plan would need to be paid for. The question now facing policymakers is whether to turn t o Social Security payments, the last guaranteed safety net for many retirees, to do so.\n\nTara Siegel Bernard is a personal finance reporter.

Be sure to check your policy carefully to make sure you understand what the policy does and doesn\u2019t cover.\u201d\n\nPeople will have until April 23 to comment on the proposal. Mr. Azar said he hoped to issue final rules by \u201cmid- to late-spring.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Trump administration predicted that issuers of short-term insurance would experience \u201can increase in premium revenues and profits\u201d because they could set prices to reflect the risk that an individual consumer would have high medical costs.\n\nThree cabinet departments \u2014 Treasury, labor and health and human services \u2014 drafted the proposed rules after Mr. Trump\u2019s order in October, when he said he was saving people from \u201cthe nightmare of Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s action represents an important promise kept by the president,\u201d Mr. Azar said Tuesday.\n\nSenator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, said the short-term policies provided a useful alternative to costly major medical coverage that complied with the 2010 health law. Consumers, he said, need \u201cmore, not fewer, health insurance options.\u201d\n\nBut Mike Kreidler, the state insurance commissioner in Washington State, said short-term medical plans posed risks for consumers.\n\n\u201cIf you get sick,\u201d Mr. Kreidler said, \u201cyou may not be able to renew your coverage \u2014 there are no protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Maternity care and mental-health benefits often are excluded.\u201d\n\nShort-term insurance had long been defined, by states and the federal government, as coverage lasting less than 12 months. But the Obama administration changed that in late 2016, after concluding that some insurers were abusing short-term plans and keeping healthier consumers out of the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.\n\nTrump administration officials said that short-term insurance policies had become increasingly important because premiums more than doubled, on average, from 2013 to 2017 for health plans on the federal insurance exchange.", "keywords": ["affordable", "plans", "health", "administration", "care", "rules", "trump", "policies", "shortterm", "relax", "insurance", "moves", "coverage", "cheaper"], "polarity": 0.10881851481851482, "subjectivity": 0.42770274170274175},

And it is expected to get progressively heavier, as the budget deficit swells.\n\nTo top it off, a Republican president and a Republican Congress seem set on completing the longstanding Republican project to gut the safety net built by Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson, which they blame for encouraging sloth, and replace it with a leaner welfare regime that closely ties government benefits to hard work.\n\nAs noted in a new set of proposals by leading academics to combat poverty, published Tuesday by the Russell Sage Foundation, anti-poverty policies and related social-welfare benefits over the last quarter-century \u201chave largely shifted from a system of guaranteed income support to a work-based safety net.\u201d\n\nThe economists Hilary Hoynes of the University of California, Berkeley, and Marianne Bitler of the University of California, Davis, pointed out in a recent paper that \u201cthe safety net for low-income families with children has transformed from one subsidizing out-of-work families into one subsidizing in-work families.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, as many unemployed Americans discovered the last time recession hit, government benefits that require recipients to hold a job become worthless when there is no work to be had.\n\nConsider what happened the last time around, when the bursting of the housing bubble pushed millions of workers out of their jobs. The Fed quickly slashed interest rates to zero. Months later it started buying billions of dollars\u2019 worth of bonds from financial institutions to lower long-term interest rates and encourage borrowing.\n\nThe Obama administration hurried to cobble together an economic stimulus package of more than $1 trillion to get money to families that needed it most. It expanded the eligibility for unemployment insurance to its longest duration ever, 99 weeks. It raised the earned-income tax credit for low-wage workers. It more than doubled the budget for food stamps \u2014 the poor\u2019s last line of defense.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But the administration\u2019s intervention to bolster the nation\u2019s welfare programs made a decisive difference for millions who otherwise would have fallen through the cracks of the nation\u2019s threadbare safety net.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUsing a broad definition of income and poverty that includes the effects of the complete array of government tools to support low-income families, Professors Hoynes and Bitler concluded that food stamps were critical to stem poverty.\n\nHad food stamps not been available, they estimated, the share of Americans under 65 living below the poverty line would have exceeded 11 percent in 2010, almost 1.5 percentage points more than was the case. The share of Americans in extreme poverty \u2014 with less than half the resources of the simply poor \u2014 would have exceeded 4 percent, about a third more than it turned out to be. Unemployment insurance had a roughly similar impact on poverty levels.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat is critical to note is that each of the two programs did more to relieve extreme poverty during the depths of the Great Recession than even the earned-income tax credit, the main source of government support for low-income Americans.\n\nIndeed, expenditures per capita from the earned-income tax credit increased only modestly after the recession hit. And spending by Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the patchwork of state-run programs that emerged from welfare reform in 1996 to replace the poor\u2019s entitlement to federal cash assistance, did not respond to the recession at all.\n\nThis is a problem for vulnerable Americans bracing for the next economic shock, because if Mr. Trump and his colleagues in Congress have their way, the only surviving bit of the social safety net when the next recession hits will probably require beneficiaries to work. The earned-income tax credit is likely to survive unscathed. Food stamps are not.\n\nAssiduously looking for places to cut spending to temper a growing budget deficit, the White House seems more than willing to pare the safety net. The budget it unveiled this month called for a 27 percent cut to the food stamp budget and a 20 percent cut to Section 8 housing assistance by 2028.\n\nThe administration already allows states to impose work requirements on Medicaid beneficiaries to shave the program\u2019s costs. And the latest White House budget requested a 22.5 percent cut to Medicaid and Obamacare subsidies by 2028 by repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhile the Trump administration is unlikely to end unemployment insurance, the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program expired at the end of 2013. In some states, benefits expire in as little as 12 weeks.\n\nPolicy could change in the face of a new economic downturn, to be sure. There are plenty of places where the social safety net could be improved. The Russell Sage proposals include everything from a universal child allowance to a renter\u2019s tax credit; from subsidizing employment to a public works program paying a living wage.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet somehow I can\u2019t see Mr. Trump and Republican allies like the House speaker, Paul D.

He had access to some of the same sensitive information Mr. Trump saw, but lacked a permanent security clearance.\n\nHis resignation, on Feb. 7 after two ex-wives accused him of abuse and photos surfaced of one with a black eye she said he had given her, prompted scrutiny over White House aides\u2019 clearances. Some, including Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, may now have their access to closely held materials revoked as investigations into their backgrounds continue.\n\nMr. Porter has denied abusing his ex-wives, and has instead suggested that the women have not shared the whole story. Several of his friends and former colleagues in Congress and in the White House share this belief. Mr. Porter has also privately told people that he believes the security clearance debacle says more about the dysfunction at the White House than it does about his behavior.\n\nMr. Porter declined to comment for this story. This account is based on interviews with two dozen people, many of whom would not be named because they still work in politics, who were not authorized to comment or were reluctant to speak publicly in his defense.\n\nThe elder Mr. Porter, a former aide to Presidents Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan and a Harvard professor since 1977, set high expectations for his oldest son, who followed his father\u2019s blueprint closely. Both were Rhodes scholars.\n\nThe family spent years gathering for dinners and events at the red brick Dunster House dormitory on the Harvard campus, where the elder Mr. Porter was a master. Mr. Porter\u2019s mother, who died in 2017, was the faculty dean of Dunster House, along the banks of the Charles River.\n\nThe family kept a home in Belmont, Mass., the town where the construction of a 69,600-square-foot Mormon temple was completed in 2000. The Porters socialized with other prominent Mormon families, full of high-achieving children and known to compete with each other.

The two were in love but sometimes argued over Mr. Porter\u2019s ambition, according to two people who were close to both during their marriage. In 2005, Ms. Holderness said that Mr. Porter punched her while the two were on vacation in Europe, and that he later took photos of a black eye she sustained during their argument. In 2008, Mr. Porter and Ms. Holderness divorced.\n\nBy late 2009, he was married to Jennifer Willoughby. Months later, she filed a restraining order against him for trying to enter her apartment while they were separated.\n\nThrough his personal struggles, Mr. Porter had support from his father, whose influence in Washington helped him secure jobs there.\n\n\u201cHis dad had a very strong hand in decisions that he made,\u201d Ms. Willoughby recalled, \u201cand also sometimes made connections for Rob.\u201d She, like his first wife, is Mormon as well.\n\nWhen he arrived on Capitol Hill in 2011, Mr. Porter was seen by many who knew him as confident and capable. Several colleagues say Mr. Porter was a consummate professional. As a chief counsel for Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, Mr. Porter reprimanded an aide who made an inappropriate comment toward a woman who worked in the office, according to two people who worked there at the time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Rob for several years, as both a friend and a co-worker,\u201d Ellen James, who worked with Mr. Porter in Mr. Lee\u2019s office, wrote in an email. \u201cI was never aware of any of the allegations that have become public over the last few days. To my knowledge, he always treated everyone with the utmost respect and professionalism in the workplace.\u201d\n\nKevin Smith, a spokesman for Senator Rob Portman, the Republican of Ohio in whose office Mr. Porter briefly worked as general counsel, said in a statement that no indication of inappropriate behavior was seen during Mr. Porter\u2019s time there.\n\nAfter working in Mr. Portman\u2019s office, Mr. Porter took the chief of staff job with Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, in 2014. According to two aides who worked with him there, Mr. Porter was arrogant and overly ambitious, even in a town that seems to have limitless capacity for both. He would occasionally lose his temper and become red in the face when he found himself on the losing end of a workplace argument, the aides said.\n\nAs he worked his way through Capitol Hill, Mr. Porter went through his second divorce in 2013. At some point during that separation, friends say Mr. Porter began to be less active within his Mormon community and began drinking, which is discouraged in the faith.\n\nTwo friends of Mr. Porter\u2019s, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation for appearing to defend him, said that Mr. Porter had at times struggled to reconcile a stringent religious background with his failed marriages. To be divorced once in the Mormon faith is unusual, they both said, and to be divorced twice is rare.\n\nUsually private about his personal life \u2014 few who knew him, including his colleagues at the White House, were even aware he had been married twice \u2014 he mentioned to at least one former colleague on Capitol Hill that he would never marry a Mormon woman again.\n\nAt the White House, Mr. Porter was seen as a capable, if somewhat overeager, presence. The former White House official said that Mr. Porter had been discussed as a possibility as deputy chief of staff, but it was unclear whether his issues obtaining a security clearance prevented him from advancing.\n\nQuestions remain over who knew what, and when, about the investigation into Mr. Porter\u2019s background, including John F. Kelly, the chief of staff, and Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel. Late last year, a distraught girlfriend told Mr. McGahn that Mr. Porter had anger problems, according to people familiar with the conversation.\n\nMr. McGahn, who knew the woman, raised the issue with Mr. Porter, but did not follow up.", "keywords": ["ambition", "charisma", "disguised", "republican", "anger", "rob", "house", "mr", "white", "harvard", "mormon", "ms", "porters", "flareups", "porter", "worked"], "polarity": 0.06179723502304147, "subjectivity": 0.3278957780570683},

But conservatives who believed his presidency would be more of a sharp break with the Bush years are starting to express alarm. And their concern could indicate trouble for Mr. Trump if his more conventional approach on some policy issues alienates his base and depresses Republican turnout in the midterm elections in November.\n\n\u201cRight at the point when everyone was thinking in my world that things were just going swimmingly, there are some good and important questions being raised,\u201d said Matt Schlapp, president of the American Conservative Union, which this week will host Mr. Trump as a speaker at its annual Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nOthers have been less generous. Mark Levin, the right-wing talk show host who is also set to speak at CPAC, recently asked his audience, \u201cIs conservatism dead?\u201d and accused lawmakers of \u201cspending like drunken Marxists.\u201d\n\nEven some Trump allies who were initially slow to trust him \u2014 precisely because they worried about his fidelity to conservative principles \u2014 are voicing skepticism. \u201cI hope this makes conservatives across the country realize that right now, they aren\u2019t getting what they voted for in Washington,\u201d Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who clashed bitterly with Mr. Trump during the 2016 Republican primaries but is now one of the president\u2019s confidants, wrote in an essay for Time.com.\n\nThe deficits that Mr. Trump and the Republican-led Congress just approved, added Mr. Paul, who was an early Tea Party star, \u201dwould make President Obama cringe.\u201d\n\nMany Republicans do indeed prefer the more accommodating version of the president when it comes to most policies. And despite the extraordinary aspects of his presidency, Mr. Trump has approached governing in a way that bears strikingly similar parallels to Mr. Bush and Ronald Reagan.\n\nOne of Mr. Bush\u2019s first official acts as president in January 2001 was to reinstate the Mexico City Policy, a global gag rule implemented under Mr. Reagan that withholds American aid from health organizations worldwide that provide or even discuss abortion in family planning. Just three days into his administration, Mr. Trump did the same thing. The White House has since sought to expand the order.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s orders that government departments must safeguard religious liberties have echoes of Mr. Bush\u2019s efforts to promote \u201cfaith-based\u201d initiatives through special administrative offices in 11 federal agencies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s effort to comb law schools and courtrooms across the country for young, unfailingly conservative nominees to the federal bench resembles the campaign Mr. Reagan undertook to leave an enduring rightward imprint on the courts.\n\nMr. Trump has also shown a great degree of deference to the military he once vowed to pull back from foreign conflict. Last year, he signed off on a troop surge in Afghanistan and he permitted the Pentagon to loosen its rules of engagement that dictate how the armed forces can pursue targets in places like Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. Military officials had complained the Obama White House\u2019s rules prevented them from moving quickly and effectively enough.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

One of his most dramatic announcements to date, withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, had little practical effect because Congress never ratified it. And last week the Commerce Department said the nation\u2019s trade deficit with China, the official measure of how many goods American businesses import compared with exports, was the highest on record.\n\nOn health care Mr. Trump has even proposed ways to lower prescription drug costs, reminiscent of Mr. Bush\u2019s Medicare Part D.\n\nIn Mr. Trump\u2019s more conventional policies, Republicans see something they do not usually find in this White House: reassurance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons someone like me \u2014 who was in the \u2018Never Trump\u2019 camp and who ultimately didn\u2019t vote for Donald Trump \u2014 finds a lot in Donald Trump to like,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush\u2019s former press secretary.\n\nMany have come to accept Mr. Trump as someone who operates on two tracks, Mr. Fleischer added. \u201cThere\u2019s the policy track,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s the personal behavior track, which sets him so far apart that it risks drowning the rest out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere are many ways, however, in which Mr. Trump has actually gone much further than his Republican predecessors in pursuing conservative policy goals \u2014 especially in the environmental and regulatory realm. Mr. Bush, for instance, appointed a moderate Republican governor from a heavily Democratic state to lead his Environmental Protection Agency, Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey. Mr. Trump named the attorney general of Oklahoma, Scott Pruitt, who had sued the agency multiple times.\n\nMr. Trump pulled out of the Paris climate accord and announced his intention to move the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem \u2014 moves most Republicans say other conservative presidents would likely have found too unsettling.\n\nBut if once-skeptical Republicans can find reasons in Mr. Trump\u2019s policies to look the other way on some of his personal shortcomings, there are also many who see little to like about his similarities with Mr. Bush, who turned budget surpluses into gaping deficits and helped spark the Republican backlash that became the Tea Party movement.\n\nMany activists have been ratcheting up the pressure. In response to Mr. Trump\u2019s signing the budget agreement and his embrace of a pathway to citizenship for younger immigrants brought here illegally as children, the Tea Party Patriots, one of the president\u2019s most reliable supporters, said conservative voters were not getting what they signed up for.\n\n\u201cThere is a sense of frustration among a lot of people who supported President Trump from the very beginning of his campaign,\u201d said Jenny Beth Martin, the group\u2019s president. \u201cThey feel a bit betrayed and they don\u2019t feel like President Trump is keeping his promise.\u201d", "keywords": ["republican", "bushs", "policy", "party", "mr", "trump", "conventional", "president", "conservative", "republicans", "approach", "edges", "trumps"], "polarity": 0.10179344465058751, "subjectivity": 0.4000055216891951},

Approval has risen from 46 percent in January and 37 percent in December, when the law was passed.\n\nA Warming Reception Since the Republican tax plan became law in December, public opinion of it has improved, though few are expecting a tax cut this year.

Still, support has grown even among Democrats, from 8 percent just before the bill passed in December to 19 percent this month. For Democrats, Mr. Cohen said, running on opposition to the bill has become more of a political gamble.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s less of a sure bet than it seemed in December,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a problem yet for Democrats, but the movement isn\u2019t a positive one.\u201d\n\nOther recent polls have shown similar upswings for the law, including a Monmouth University Poll in late January that found support for it had risen to 44 percent nationally, from 26 percent in December.\n\n\u201cI think we are essentially seeing Republicans \u2018come home\u2019 on the tax plan in our data,\u201d said Lori Weigel, a partner with Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican polling firm. \u201cThat is certainly in part due to consistent communications about the tax plan and the news coverage of prominent companies investing in workers.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have done little to counter the Republican messaging and concede it has had an effect, along with a series of high-profile company announcements of bonuses, raises or other benefits attributed to tax savings.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut they are ramping up efforts to rebrand the law as disproportionately helping shareholders and the wealthy, and they contend the boost from bonus announcements will fade.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only so long you can push a one-time bonus,\u201d said Nicole Gill, executive director of Tax March, a liberal group that has organized rallies and protests against the new law. \u201cThe fundamentals of the bill remain the same. The bill that passed is the bill that polled at 35 percent in December, and Democrats should keep talking about that.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Times polling suggests that Americans are overestimating the degree to which the benefits of the law\u2019s corporate tax cuts are flowing straight to workers \u2014 while underestimating the likelihood that the law will reduce their individual taxes.\n\nJust under one in five respondents expect to see either a raise or a bonus thanks to the law\u2019s business tax cuts. Early returns from public companies indicate that\u2019s an overshot. Just Capital, a nonprofit research organization, analyzed the 90 largest public companies that have announced how they will spend the combined $45 billion in savings they stand to receive from the tax bill this year. It found that those companies planned to pass 6 percent of those savings directly on to workers, with more than half of that spending in one-time bonuses.\n\n\u201cThat does not really track to how the public thinks the companies should be spending that money,\u201d said Martin Whittaker, Just Capital\u2019s chief executive.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The independent Tax Policy Center in Washington estimates that four in five Americans will actually see a tax cut from the law this year, though that number is projected to shrink sharply in 2027 if individual tax cuts expire as scheduled in the law.\n\nRepublicans are confident that support will continue to grow as more Americans see lower taxes reflected in their paychecks. Their confidence was reflected last week by Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, who cited Senator Heidi Heitkamp\u2019s vote against the tax bill when announcing he would run for her seat.\n\n\u201cThere is no question the tax bill has fundamentally improved the overall political environment for Republicans,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a former campaign manager and chief of staff for Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, who is now president of the public affairs firm Cavalry in Washington.\n\nClose to half of Americans now expect some direct benefit from the law \u2014 either a tax cut or a salary increase or bonus. Support for the bill is far stronger among that group: More than three-quarters of Americans approve of the law, compared with fewer than a third who don\u2019t expect a benefit or aren\u2019t sure.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGina Coats, a project manager for a plumbing company in Springfield, Mo., said she didn\u2019t follow the tax debate closely last fall. But in January, when she began preparing the company\u2019s payroll systems to handle the new law\u2019s provisions, she realized almost every employee would take home an extra $20 to $40 per week.\n\n\u201cEveryone seems to be a little more upbeat,\u201d Ms. Coats said. \u201cIt\u2019s causing people to let go of their money a little more easily.\u201d\n\nMs. Coats puts herself in that category. A few days ago, she called a contractor to move forward with a long-delayed plan to replace the roof on her house. That decision reflected her tax savings, she said, but also the strength of the local economy, which has meant lots of projects for her company, and stability for its employees.\n\n\u201cIf we have more work in the bag, then I feel more comfortable,\u201d Ms. Coats said.\n\nRepublicans have long promoted tax cuts as a way to encourage economic growth. Many economists are skeptical of that approach when unemployment is low and the Federal Reserve is moving to tamp down inflation. Rising support for the bill has coincided with an uptick in consumer confidence, although there aren\u2019t yet clear signs that Americans are spending more.\n\nEdging Upward SurveyMonkey\u2019s consumer confidence index, which combines five questions on Americans\u2019 financial and economic outlook, rose in January and held onto those gains in February. 80 60 40 Total Republican Democrats 2017 April July Oct. 2018 Consumer confidence index\n\nColleen Doering, who runs a small facilities maintenance business outside Orlando, Fla., said she and her husband were paying several hundred dollars a month less in taxes because of the new law. As a result, they recently decided to spend $10,000 on a landscaping project and started to plan a vacation.\n\n\u201cMy paycheck has increased, and if I see it in my paycheck, then I know my employees are seeing it in theirs,\u201d Ms. Doering said.\n\nAnd the law\u2019s corporate tax cuts are giving the Doerings more money to spend on marketing, which they hope will allow them to expand their three-year-old business and hire more people. That may not be easy, however. Ms. Doering said it was already hard to find good workers, and the stimulus provided by the tax cuts could make it even harder.\n\n\u201cIt was becoming more challenging to find good, solid employees with the right skill sets,\u201d Ms. Doering said. \u201cIt\u2019s even more challenging because some of these larger companies are grabbing up even more employees.\u201d", "keywords": ["overhaul", "gains", "tax", "cuts", "support", "public", "democrats", "buoying", "companies", "republicans", "bill", "plan", "law", "americans", "bonus"], "polarity": 0.11880139959408251, "subjectivity": 0.39754073839439696},

About 25,000 New Hampshire residents paid full freight for Obamacare plans last year, according to a legislative report, and their premiums increased by an average 52 percent this year. This group earns more than four times the poverty level \u2014 for a family of three, like the Hurds, that\u2019s about $82,000 a year.\n\nAnother 29,000 were getting subsidized coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, and many of them have seen their out-of-pocket costs drop this year. That is because when Mr. Trump forced premiums higher by cutting off a type of payment to insurers last fall that the law had guaranteed them, subsidies rose, too. About 53,000 are getting free Medicaid coverage through the health law\u2019s optional expansion of the program.\n\nMs. Hurd remembers watching a documentary about people signing up for Obamacare coverage last year and bristling when someone who got a big subsidy gushed about the low price.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018It\u2019s not expensive for you because everybody else is paying for it,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nShe also has problems with the Medicaid \u201cexpansion population,\u201d made up of working-age adults who have no disability \u2014 particularly those who aren\u2019t working as hard as she and her husband are. Cut off from the help Obamacare provided to everyone under a certain income level, as well as the contributions that employers make toward their employees\u2019 health coverage, she was caught in what she saw as an unduly penalized subset.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m totally happy to pay my fair share,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I\u2019m also paying someone else\u2019s share, and that\u2019s what makes me insane.\u201d\n\nMs. Hurd finished college at the University of Massachusetts, with her parents paying for it, and has a master\u2019s degree in communications, which she got tuition-free while working in admissions at Southern New Hampshire University. She\u2019s been working about 30 hours a week at the outlet mall and a small remodeling firm while looking for a job with good benefits in communications or marketing.\n\nHer husband, Matt, started his contracting business a few years ago and is finishing his undergraduate degree with the help of a loan. They bought a 1750s farmhouse just before they married; Ms. Hurd returned to work when their son, Harry, was eight weeks old.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThough roughly the same age, Ms. DiCola has followed a different course. She dropped out of the Manhattan School of Music in 2009 after her freshman year because she couldn\u2019t keep up with the tuition. Now, to supplement the scant income she gets from singing gigs, she drives for Uber and Lyft a few nights a week, sometimes more, in Boston. She earned about $15,000 last year, making sure she stayed under the threshold to qualify for Medicaid.\n\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s no different from what corporations do all the time, taking advantage of tax breaks and that sort of thing,\u201d Ms. DiCola, a soprano who talks animatedly about Verdi and Puccini, said of being on Medicaid. \u201cFrankly, if they\u2019re allowed to do it, why shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMedical care has been easy to access on Medicaid. She got physical therapy for an old injury, and when she needed to have an IUD surgically removed last year, she went to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Hanover, the state\u2019s most prestigious hospital. She paid for none of it. She spends most of her income on paying off her car, a used 2012 Prius with 160,000 miles on it, and her last outstanding student loan.\n\n\u201cThe coverage is actually really good,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just kind of finding my way, so the health insurance is so helpful.\u201d\n\nFor Ms. Hurd, health care has been something to avoid since she and her husband got the marketplace plan shortly after Harry\u2019s birth last year. (Before that, she had a job with benefits but quit because of her difficult pregnancy.) She went to an urgent care clinic for a throat culture last fall because unlike at her primary care practice, she could find out the cost, $150, upfront. And when Harry was up all night sobbing with a fever recently, she hesitated briefly before seeking medical help, again at urgent care.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The story was about a report that found Medicaid recipients used health care more aggressively than marketplace customers, presumably because their coverage was free.\n\nInstead of giving its new Medicaid recipients traditional coverage through the program, New Hampshire uses Medicaid funds to buy them private plans through the Obamacare marketplace. The report, by an independent actuarial firm, found that average medical costs for the state\u2019s expansion population were 26 percent higher than for the marketplace\u2019s other customers in 2016.\n\nThe firm found this raised average claim costs \u2014 a proxy for premiums \u2014 for everyone by 14 percent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne of the conditions that Gov. Chris Sununu has attached to continuing expanded Medicaid here is that most adult recipients without a disability or small children will have to work, volunteer or get job training, at least 20 hours a week. New Hampshire is among eight Republican-controlled states asking the Trump administration for approval to impose work requirements; two others, Kentucky and Indiana, already got permission last month.\n\nMs. Hurd \u2014 who says she thinks \u201cwork is everything, honestly\u201d \u2014 is elated about the possibility.\n\n\u201cIf there were actual repercussions aside from your personal self-worth \u2014 like \u2018Hey, you may not be able to get the pills you need\u2019 \u2014 people might be more inclined to work,\u201d she said.\n\nBut research has found that most Medicaid recipients without disabilities, like Ms. DiCola, already work at least part-time.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI know I live with my parents, but I\u2019m not going on fancy trips or anything like that \u2014 I feel guilty when I buy a new lipstick,\u201d she said. She worried when she had the flu in December and lost four days of income, she said, adding, \u201cI\u2019d like not to feel like I\u2019m constantly so close to the edge.\u201d\n\nMs. DiCola started driving for Uber and Lyft three years ago, after stints at a Panera and a train station cafe. She often shuttles customers around Boston until after midnight, making up to $25 an hour \u2014 enough to pay two or three times more than the $87.50 she owes on her student loan each month, plus buy gas. Her days include pitching in on cooking and other household duties, auditions, rehearsals and studying musical scores on her couch, a cat or two by her side. She hopes to get a college degree, find a more stable career and get access to employer health coverage. But for now, with a free place to live and with Medicaid, she said, \u201cI\u2019m able to throw all my money at paying off my debt.\u201d\n\nAnxiety and Peace of Mind\n\nMs. Hurd is a former Republican who volunteered for Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign in 2012 and voted for Carly Fiorina in the 2016 primary, but now describes her politics as more libertarian. She\u2019s pro-immigration, not least because she sees immigrants as having strong work ethics. She voted for Hillary Clinton in the general election, she said, because she finds President Trump deeply offensive, a \u201cguy who bullied his way into power.\u201d\n\nHer father, a Trump voter from the Boston suburbs, sends her articles that are critical of the health law, and they resonate with her.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven members of her own family take advantage of a flawed system, in her view, by getting Medicaid. \u201cThey don\u2019t work because they don\u2019t want to, and they get free health insurance.\u201d She said. \u201cWhat the heck? If my husband and I, who grew up with relatively middle-class backgrounds in wealthy states, know people that mooch off the system in our immediate families, imagine what it\u2019s like elsewhere.\u201d\n\nMs. DiCola\u2019s father, a solo-practice lawyer, is also a Trump supporter, but she is a liberal Democrat and uneasily aware of the anger and frustration that unsubsidized Obamacare customers are feeling \u2014 so much so that at first, she worried about sharing her story with The New York Times and \u201cbeing dragged through the mud on some 24-hour news channel\u201d for being on Medicaid.\n\nShe described her state\u2019s plan to impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients as \u201cpoor-shaming.\u201d Her friends show more empathy, she said. When she needed a root canal and crown last year and Medicaid would not have paid for it (dental care is one area that Medicaid does not cover comprehensively, or sometimes at all), she posted about it on Facebook and her friends jumped in to help.\n\nMs. DiCola doesn\u2019t expect to need much health care this year \u2014 just a physical and a new pair of glasses, which Medicaid will cover, she said. Still, she added, \u201cYou never know what could come up \u2014 my appendix could decide to burst tomorrow.\u201d In which case, Medicaid would cover the emergency room visit, surgery and hospital stay, a huge relief to Ms. DiCola, who became so anxious as Republicans in Congress tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act last summer that she felt physically ill.\n\nMs. Hurd has had no such peace of mind. A burst appendix would likely cost at least her individual deductible of $6,300.\n\nBy late January, Ms. Hurd had begun to believe that the only way for her family to have any access to health care was to drop their insurance and save the $928 a month to spend on care when they need it. Harry\u2019s recent illness had rattled her, and Matt wanted to see a chiropractor for back pain that was threatening his ability to work.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t afford to both treat his back issues and pay for insurance,\u201d she said one morning. She was crying, and it was time to go to work.\n\nThe following week, after months of searching, Ms. Hurd got offered a full-time job with benefits, running social-media marketing for a company that sells plant nutrition products. The Hurds plan on dropping their Obamacare policy in April, when her new coverage, with a $300 monthly premium, should kick in. The deductible \u2014 $3,000 per person, up to $6,000 for the family \u2014 will still be higher than she\u2019d like, but she didn\u2019t complain. Her indignation seemed to be softening.\n\n\u201cI understand that some people cannot afford health care and shouldn\u2019t just be left to suffer,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there has to be a better way than asking a very small amount of people to foot that bill.\u201d", "keywords": ["gwen", "obamacare", "dicola", "health", "medicaid", "care", "trump", "dilemma", "ms", "hurd", "free", "work", "coverage", "squeezed"], "polarity": 0.08167645846217277, "subjectivity": 0.4214222153507866},

His white shirt and gray slacks were an accordion of wrinkles. His hair, flecked with gray, drooped on his forehead and small dark rings had formed under his eyes.\n\nBut he hadn\u2019t lost his voice. The Democratic congressman from El Paso was speaking to a crowd of several hundred at Suga\u2019s restaurant, 830 miles from home, trying to make an improbable case: that he can defeat Texas\u2019 incumbent Republican senator, Ted Cruz.\n\nDemocrats need to pick up two seats in the midterm elections to win control of the Senate, but they also must defend incumbents in 10 states that President Trump won. Mr. Cruz is seen as safer than, say, Dean Heller, Nevada\u2019s Republican senator, or the seats in Arizona and Tennessee that are being vacated by incumbents. And with Democratic money playing defense for incumbents in Missouri, Indiana, West Virginia and elsewhere, Mr. O\u2019Rourke expects no cavalry from Washington to come help him.\n\nBut Democrats will need wins wherever they can get them \u2014 so the long-shot is going it alone.\n\nImage The Brandon Community Center in Lufkin.\n\nImage Laura Bowman announced supporters of Mr. O'Rourke raised $1,200 for his campaign.\n\nImage Mr. O'Rourke arrived for a town hall event in Wharton, Texas.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke told the crowd at Suga\u2019s that the \u201cDreamers\u201d \u2014 young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children \u2014 should be protected. No wall should be built on the border with a friendly country. College must be more affordable. Women deserve access to reproductive health services. All Muslims should not be banned, and the press is not the enemy of the people.\n\nHe appealed to their sense of virtue. \u201cThis smallness, this bigotry, this paranoia, this anxiety,\u201d he said, cadence accelerating, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to be for the big, aspirational, ambitious things.\u201d\n\nHe appealed to their sense of humor. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason that Congress has an approval rating of around nine percent. Nine percent! Communism ten percent. Gonorrhea eight percent. We\u2019re right in the middle.\u201d\n\nAnd he appealed to their anger at Washington. The \u201csystem is rigged,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI can tell you that access is purchased, that votes are bought and paid for, that outcomes are determined before you have a chance to call your member of Congress or senator.\u201d\n\nThe crowd cheered, they hooted, they left saying things like \u201che was great\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\n\nImage A donation bin was passed around the room in Lufkin.\n\nBefore Beaumont, Mr. O\u2019Rourke spoke to town halls this month in Lufkin and Woodville, deeply conservative places where Democrats are rarely seen. \u201cIt takes guts to come to this area,\u201d one woman in Woodville said. The man who introduced him in Lufkin had just one request, that he refrain from swearing, an admonition that Mr. O\u2019Rourke heeded in Lufkin but not in Beaumont.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke is favored to win his party primary next month and challenge Mr. Cruz. But his odds in November are beyond long. No Democrat has won a statewide office in Texas since 1994, the year before Amazon sold its first book.\n\nBy the calculations of Mike Baselice, a Republican pollster in Austin, demographic changes might make Texas competitive in 2032, certainly not in 2018. Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s quest, he said, is \u201csame book, different chapter\u201d of other Democratic hopefuls. \u201cThis is not a level playing field here.\u201d\n\nIt has been so bleak for Democrats in Texas that they define victory in terms of the size of their losses. A running joke in Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s speeches is that he has almost convinced his mother, Melissa, a Republican, to vote for him.\n\nIf the hill weren\u2019t steep enough, Mr. O\u2019Rourke also has refused to hire outside consultants or pollsters, and he will only accept contributions from individuals. He has no interest in using big data. When he tells this to Democratic colleagues in the House, some have simply turned and walked away from him, unable to take him seriously.\n\nBut there is power in the giant-killer narrative and signs that his anti-campaign playbook campaign is working. He raised $2.4 million in the last quarter, and gets applause when he notes that was $500,000 more than Mr. Cruz took in.\n\nHe has a restless energy that has put him in 217 of Texas 254 counties, driving tens of thousands of miles, fueled by bad coffee and Hostess cupcakes that supporters bring him.\n\nImage Mr. O'Rourke's schedule for a day of campaigning.\n\nImage Mr. O'Rourke stopped at a gas station near Brenham, Tex.\n\nImage Chris Evans, Mr. O'Rourke's communications director, recorded a Facebook live video in the parking lot of their hotel in Beaumont, Tex.\n\nIn Lufkin, he was greeted with chants of \u201cBeto, Beto, Beto.\u201d His campaign took in $1,258 in checks and cash dropped into a large jar.\n\n\u201cI think he can win. I think he can inspire Texans,\u201d said Susan McCulley, adding, \u201cwe\u2019re not just mad, we\u2019re scared.\u201d\n\nAnother supporter, Ferryn Martin, said, \u201cIn 2010, the Tea Party was mad. This year, we are mad.\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke tries to tap into that emotion.

Driving with his left forearm and right elbow on the steering wheel, he asked her about the science fair projects of their three children.\n\nHis theory of the case is that he can make the sale in rural Texas in part simply by showing up. If he can cut down Mr. Cruz\u2019s margins there and generate energy in urban precincts and suburbs, he can become the first Democrat since Lloyd Bentsen in 1988 to win a Texas Senate seat.\n\nDemocrats in Texas have long been saying that the demographic changes sweeping the state, fueled by a surge in the Latino population, would eventually make the state two-party competitive, but even some of the more optimistic forecasts don\u2019t have that happening until 2024. Still, there are other factors at work that add to their hopes. The number of college-educated residents in the state increased by 20 percent from 2006 to 2016, according to Lloyd Potter, the Texas state demographer. Rural areas are losing population while urban and suburban areas are gaining.\n\n\u201cIf one was able to figure out how to turn out the Latino vote and the African-American vote, that could change things pretty dramatically,\u201d Mr. Potter said. \u201cThe issue is how far-off in the horizon it is.\u201d\n\nImage Velenta Mathews-Hunter, a retired school teacher, shook hands with Mr. O'Rourke in Orange, Tex.\n\nImage A cardboard cut-out of John wayne in Robert\u2019s Restaurant and Meat Market in Orange.\n\nImage\n\nBut President Trump, who carried the state by nine percentage points, is complicating conventional analysis. \u201cAll things being equal, if there wasn\u2019t a Trump, it would be in the mid 2020s until the state would get competitive,\u201d said Russ Tidwell, a Democratic consultant who has worked in the state for decades. \u201cBut Trump makes other things possible.\u201d\n\nAnd Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign is all about a sense of the possible.\n\nHis biography does not have any of the bootstraps appeal of a Lyndon Johnson, or even Mr. Cruz, the son of immigrant parents. Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s family was well-to-do in El Paso. Born Robert Francis O\u2019Rourke, he has been known as \u201cBeto\u201d from infancy. His voice shows no hint of a Texas accent until his says his first name and sounds like he is speaking Spanish \u2014 which he does, fluently.\n\nHe was sent to Woodberry Forest boarding school in Virginia, then Columbia, where he was captain of the crew team. He played in a punk rock band, hauled expensive art and enjoyed the wanderlust that a young man from a wealthy family can afford. He went back to El Paso and started a technology company, then ran for City Council before winning his House seat in 2012, defeating an incumbent.\n\nIn the House, he has hardly left a footprint. He did not vote for Representative Nancy Pelosi to be the Democratic leader, and Mr. O\u2019Rourke, 45, thinks his party in Congress needs fresh leaders, which is one reason he supports term limits.\n\nImage Cynthia Cano, Mr. O'Rourke's campaign logistics and events director, with him for an event in Beaumont.\n\nMr. Cruz, who did not respond to a request to discuss the race, has never been as popular as Republicans like former governors George W. Bush or Rick Perry, but he has been tactically adroit and plays well to more conservative voters. He has an uneasy alliance with Mr. Trump that started with the president calling him \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d during the primaries and has evolved into invitations to the White House.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s is an emotive approach, Mr. Cruz\u2019s one of cold-eyed precision.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he is a flash in the pan,\u201d William Martin, a scholar at the Baker Institute at Rice University said of Mr. O\u2019Rourke. \u201cHe\u2019s young and fresh, and he\u2019s just intrinsically so much more attractive than Ted Cruz for voters who don\u2019t already have their minds made up.\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke knows Mr. Cruz is a skilled debater, a proven fund-raiser and a candidate who showed in his presidential campaign that he could leverage analytics into millions of votes. And the congressman has vulnerabilities. Mr. O\u2019Rourke has been arrested twice, once for a college prank, a second time, in 1998, for what he called the \u201cunforgivably\u201d bad decision to drive after \u201chaving too much to drink.\u201d Both charges were dismissed.\n\nHis mother receives fund-raising solicitations from Mr. Cruz, who calls her son a \u201cNancy Pelosi liberal,\u201d no doubt a preview of things to come.\n\nBut Mr. O\u2019Rourke also will use Mr. Cruz\u2019s well-observed ambition against him, and said that the incumbent\u2019s real goal is another White House run. He cites a letter that Mr. Cruz sent to Gov. Kim Reynolds, Republican of Iowa, talking about visiting all of Iowa\u2019s 99 counties.\n\n\u201cI know he hasn\u2019t been to all 254 of Texas\u2019 counties,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said.\n\nImage Mr. O'Rourke at Suga's restaurant in Beaumont.\n\nImage Mr. O'Rourke's campaign buttons are designed in the likeness of Robert F. Kennedy, his political hero.\n\nImage Mr. O'Rourke talked to his wife, Amy, in his hotel room in Bay City, Tex.\n\nTexas is so vast that it is nearly impossible to travel the entire state the way that Mr. O\u2019Rourke has chosen to, largely by car, over state highways and rural roads, but he seems undeterred and drives most of the miles himself, with aides in passenger seats.\n\nOver lunch at the Lufkin BBQ, Mr. O\u2019Rourke said his campaign strategy was in part drawn from the 1968 presidential campaign of his political hero, Robert F. Kennedy, long on hope and aspiration.\n\nMr. Kennedy was not driven by \u201cpolls or consultants, but he really seemed to be grounded in the things that he found important,\u201d he said, adding that he often seemed to be going directly against the advice of what was going to be popular.\n\nThose seemed to be the words of a long-shot, a candidate with nothing to lose.\n\nImage Mr. O'Rourke at an event in Woodville, Tex.\n\nOrder Reprints | Today\u2019s Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A 9 of the New York edition with the headline: A Blue Spark In the Heart Of Deep-Red Cruz Country\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up for the Morning Briefing Get what you need to know to start your day in the United States, Canada and the Americas, delivered to your inbox.

The suspect, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, had no criminal record. He bought at least seven guns legally, including an AK-47 he had purchased in the past month, a federal law enforcement official said on Monday.\n\nMr. Cruz, who has confessed to investigators, appeared on Monday in a Fort Lauderdale courtroom in shackles and a red jumpsuit as lawyers argued over whether a defense motion filed last week should be kept confidential. Mr. Cruz did not look up during the brief hearing.\n\nSeveral other Republicans have expressed a willingness since the shooting to discuss a change in gun laws, though they have given few specifics. On Monday, Gov. Rick Scott of Florida announced he would hold meetings with state and local leaders, focusing on ways to improve school safety, expand mental health care and keep guns out of the hands of people with mental illness.\n\nGov. John Kasich of Ohio said on Sunday that some \u201csmall steps\u201d should be taken on gun control, addressing background checks and mental illness. Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont said in a statement that his administration would review its procedures and policies on gun safety.\n\nNeither suggested that change was imminent. Their remarks recalled other murmurings of change that ultimately fizzled. Congress has been marked by intransigence on gun legislation, including a failure last year to ban so-called bump stocks, an accessory that the gunman in the October shooting in Las Vegas used to transform his semiautomatic rifles to mimic automatic weapon fire. That shooting left 58 people dead and wounded hundreds.\n\nStudents from Parkland and across the country have organized protests and marches to urge Mr. Trump and lawmakers to act. About 100 people gathered in front of the White House on Monday to rally for stricter gun control. Seventeen students, representing the number of people killed in Florida, lay on the ground in protest. Parents, teachers and friends joined them on the pavement, and high school students stood in clusters in 40-degree temperatures, chanting \u201cEnough is enough!\u201d and waving signs that read \u201cAm I next?\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

You are the president of the United States, and you have the audacity to put this on Russia as an excuse.\u201d\n\nThe legislation last fall was considered a modest step toward a bipartisan compromise on gun safety.\n\nThe lead senators behind the bill \u2014 Mr. Cornyn and Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut \u2014 have seen some of the worst mass shootings in United States history unfold in their states. A shooting that killed 20 first graders and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012 came near the start of Mr. Murphy\u2019s time in office, and gun restrictions became a defining issue for him. The shooting deaths of over two dozen people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., in November prompted Mr. Cornyn to be a co-sponsor of the bill.\n\nAfter the Texas shooting, Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked the F.B.I. to conduct an extensive review of the database because, as he said in a statement at the time, \u201crelevant information may not be getting reported.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet on Monday, Mr. Murphy said that the bill alone would do little to stop the what he called an \u201cepidemic\u201d of violence.\n\nThe president, who has spoken favorably about gun rights over the years, has held wavering views on gun restrictions. He had a concealed weapon permit in New York when Rudolph W. Giuliani was mayor, but it is not clear whether he maintained it.\n\nIn 2000, as he considered an earlier run for president, Mr. Trump wrote in his book \u201cThe America We Deserve\u201d that \u201cI generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I also support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWith today\u2019s internet technology we should be able to tell within 72 hours if a potential gun owner has a record.\u201d\n\nIn 2016 on CNN, Mr. Trump said guns should not be allowed in classrooms, and then followed up moments later by saying that some teachers should have access to firearms.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou look at some of our schools, unbelievable what\u2019s going on, but I\u2019m not advocating guns in the classroom,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the time. \u201cRemember in some cases, a lot of people admit this, trained teachers should be able to have guns in classrooms.\u201d", "keywords": ["changes", "background", "adds", "teachers", "support", "gun", "mr", "york", "students", "trump", "school", "guns", "buyers", "states", "shooting", "checks", "cautious"], "polarity": -0.009549309138350233, "subjectivity": 0.3835397023068255},

Justice Kennedy was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, a Republican. President Trump may be an unconventional Republican, but he is a Republican.\n\nJustices also try to retire early in a president\u2019s term, generally in the first two years, according to a 2010 study by Ross M. Stolzenberg, a demographer at the University of Chicago, and James T. Lindgren, a law professor at Northwestern. The study considered justices who served between 1789 and 2006.\n\n\u201cIf the incumbent president is of the same party as the president who nominated the justice to the court, and if the incumbent president is in the first two years of a four-year presidential term,\u201d the study found, \u201cthen the justice has odds of resignation that are about 2.6 times higher than when these two conditions are not met.\u201d\n\nJustices also take account of who controls the Senate and its internal rules.\n\n\u201cIf I resign any time this year,\u201d Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in the fall of 2014, less than two years into President Obama\u2019s second term, \u201che could not successfully appoint anyone I would like to see in the court.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo anybody who thinks that if I step down, Obama could appoint someone like me, they\u2019re misguided,\u201d she said.\n\nArtemus Ward, the author of \u201cDeciding to Leave: The Politics of Retirement From the United States Supreme Court,\u201d said Justice Kennedy found himself at a crucial crossroads. If he wants to resign under a Republican president in the first half of a presidential term, he must act.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now or never,\u201d said Mr. Ward, a political scientist at Northern Illinois University. \u201cIt\u2019s either this year or you wait until the next election.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nParty loyalty is likely to overcome more subtle concerns about judicial legacy, Mr. Ward said. Justice Kennedy holds the crucial vote in many closely divided cases, and he has been drifting to the left. He has cast conservative votes in cases on campaign finance and gun rights but has lately voted with the court\u2019s liberal wing on gay rights, abortion and affirmative action.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nBut Mr. Ward said Justice Kennedy is likely to emulate Justice Byron R. White, who drifted to the right after his appointment by President John F. Kennedy, a Democrat. Even so, Justice White said, it was fitting to retire under a Democratic president because he had been appointed by one. He stepped down not long after President Bill Clinton was elected and was replaced by Justice Ginsburg, whose voting record has been considerably more liberal.\n\nA new study on departures from the Supreme Court attempted to refine the conventional factors by considering political science data on justices\u2019 voting patterns, involuntary departures and missed opportunities. It concluded that justices have not been particularly successful at ensuring that they would be replaced by like-minded successors.\n\nJustice Kennedy is in a ticklish spot, said the study\u2019s author, Christine Kexel Chabot, who teaches at Loyola University Chicago School of Law. He is, she wrote, a moderate conservative, and there is no reason to think a president of either party would replace him with someone similar.\n\nIn all likelihood, she wrote, Mr. Trump would appoint a committed conservative like his first nominee, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch. In the few divided cases in which Justices Kennedy and Gorsuch participated in the court\u2019s last term, they agreed just 38 percent of the time. By contrast, Justice Gorsuch agreed with Justice Clarence Thomas, the court\u2019s most conservative member, 100 percent of the time.\n\nMs. Chabot also explored justices\u2019 decisions to forgo opportunities to retire under like-minded presidents.\n\nOf the 16 justices since 1954 who reached the age 65 and had served on the court for at least 18 years, Ms. Chabot found, nine passed up politically opportune retirements, risking having to leave the court for health reasons in less attractive circumstances.\n\nTwo of them \u2014 Justices White and John Paul Stevens \u2014 retired later on. Justice Elena Kagan replaced Justice Stevens, and her voting record resembles his.\n\nAnother two, Justices Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, could have retired under President Obama but continue to serve.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStaying on is understandable, Ms. Chabot wrote. \u201cRetirement from the court is very costly for a justice,\u201d she wrote, \u201cas he or she must permanently give up what is often an immensely personally rewarding position as well as the most powerful judicial office in the United States.\u201d\n\nTry as they might, Mr. Ward said, justices have had only mixed success in deciding when to step down.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t completely time their retirements perfectly because they\u2019re just like us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know when they\u2019re going to get sick, and they don\u2019t know when they\u2019re going to die, and they don\u2019t know who is going to win the next election.\u201d\n\nAs for Justice Kennedy, Ms. Chabot noted in an interview that he has hired law clerks for the term that starts in October. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he remains on the bench,\u201d she said.", "keywords": ["anthony", "justices", "court", "ward", "mr", "chabot", "kennedy", "term", "president", "wrote", "retire", "justice", "influences", "decision"], "polarity": 0.11881962481962483, "subjectivity": 0.40213419913419907},

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/us/politics/trump-kelly-porter.html", "text": "There would be much to investigate. A few senior officials in the West Wing had access to details of the allegations of physical and emotional abuse made by Mr. Porter\u2019s ex-wives. A greater number of people had a sense that something was amiss, but chose to avert their gaze instead of asking questions.\n\nThe first hours after the issue was brought to light by an article in The Daily Mail were a confused blur, with officials like Mr. Kelly at first endorsing Mr. Porter\u2019s resignation, but then agreeing to issue statements in support of him. That disarray belied the belief of some in the White House that someone \u2014 Mr. Kelly \u2014 was finally in charge after six months of drama and infighting in 2017. In reality, these officials now concede, no one truly was.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t figured out how the place operates, and apparently they don\u2019t want to learn,\u201d said John Dean, a White House counsel under President Richard M. Nixon. The Porter situation, he added, \u201cis a manifestation of what happens when you have chaos.\u201d\n\nMr. Kelly, a four-star Marine general, had been billed as uniquely qualified to bring order to Mr. Trump\u2019s world when he took his post in July. Now he faces a morale crisis in the West Wing, where aides describe a sense of betrayal by a chief of staff they no longer trust after his claims that he had not fully known about Mr. Porter\u2019s problems and had acted within minutes once he learned of them.\n\nBut above all, White House veterans say, President Trump is responsible for the haphazard nature with which his operation has functioned, in part because he knew and cared little for the rules and norms that govern the executive branch. Unprepared to fill the ranks of a new administration, Mr. Trump never tried to set a tone of discipline or ethical rigor in his West Wing.\n\n\u201cA White House reflects the president,\u201d said William M. Daley, a chief of staff under Mr. Obama. \u201cSo he moves on to the next scandal, crisis, attack, whatever, and no self-reflection. So why should anyone be surprised that that sort of becomes the M.O., even when there\u2019s a belief that there\u2019s institutional stuff one should consider.\u201d\n\nFor 13 months, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides have approached their mercurial and process-averse boss by putting their heads down and ignoring what they could not control, avoiding information that could rattle their daily balance.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut in the case of Mr. Porter, White House aides privately acknowledge, some advisers appear to have chosen to try to protect a colleague who was generally well liked and, more important, too competent to lose. Mr. Trump himself often expressed his regard for Mr. Porter by describing him as \u201cout of central casting.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the hours after the allegations against Mr. Porter became public, some senior officials in fact hesitated to force him out, in part because they argued that if one top adviser could be felled by accusations, they could all potentially be vulnerable. Mr. Porter denied privately to his colleagues, as well as publicly, that he had ever physically abused his wives.\n\nWhat distinguished this crisis from the ones that preceded it was that it was not localized to one official, such as Stephen K. Bannon, the isolated chief strategist who left in August, or Reince Priebus, the often uninformed chief of staff who departed a month before that. Mr. Porter\u2019s case had spread to so many aspects of the White House that it ensnared a number of staff members.\n\nWhile multiple officials in the West Wing were aware that he had been unable to pass his background check, none appear to have made an effort to ascertain precisely why and take action on it. Several former White House counsels have said they would have made it their business to know if an official at Mr. Porter\u2019s level was facing allegations as serious as domestic abuse, but officials in the White House have privately maintained that Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, never did.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Bauer, a White House counsel under President Barack Obama.\n\nC. Boyden Gray, who served as White House counsel under President George Bush, said the problems might have been exacerbated by the existence of the special counsel investigation into Russian election meddling and potential Trump campaign ties to it.\n\nMr. McGahn and other senior officials may be reluctant to engage with the F.B.I. or the Justice Department on security clearances or any other matter, for fear of being drawn into the inquiry, he said. \u201cYou just didn\u2019t want to call the F.B.I. or call the D.O.J. on any subject, Russia or not,\u201d Mr. Gray said of officials in the West Wing. \u201cThat may have contributed to the breakdown here.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Mr. Trump has been in open war with the F.B.I. for months, a fact that some West Wing aides believe contributed to the debacle.\n\nThe dismissal on Wednesday of George David Banks, who was the White House point person on climate change, was seen as a particularly galling move after 13 months in which nobody in the West Wing had seemed particularly concerned about enforcing a standard for past conduct.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Banks had been told that he would not be granted a full security clearance. In an interview, he said the reason was that he had smoked marijuana a handful of times between 2010 and 2013, conduct that he said he had self-reported to the F.B.I. nearly a year ago.\n\n\u201cIt was unbelievable,\u201d Mr. Banks said of the decision to deny him a clearance, which he learned about abruptly at the end of a workday, when an official from Mr. McGahn\u2019s office and a human resources aide asked for a meeting later that evening. After informing him of their decision and allowing Mr. Banks to resign, they asked him to gather his things and escorted him from the premises.\n\nInside the West Wing, officials said, Mr. Banks is seen as collateral damage in a belated effort by Mr. Kelly and other top officials to show they are cracking down on interim security clearances.\n\nYet former White House advisers from both parties have been mystified at the ineptitude of Mr. Trump\u2019s team in dealing with the fallout from Mr. Porter\u2019s situation.\n\nPart of the problem, they argue, is a culture at the White House that does not appear to prioritize getting at the truth.\n\n\u201cThe fundamentals of Crisis Management 101 were certainly not observed here, but more importantly, there does not seem to be a priority on marshaling and disclosing the facts, whatever they may be,\u201d said Jack Quinn, who served as White House counsel under Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky affair. \u201cThey need to stop the bleeding, and I think that they\u2019ve got to understand that the bleeding is not going to stop until the full truth is told.\u201d", "keywords": ["officials", "scandal", "house", "mr", "white", "wing", "counsel", "trump", "president", "porters", "seeks", "learn", "abuse", "west"], "polarity": 0.06546208192247795, "subjectivity": 0.3426424785335676},

Mueller III, the special counsel leading the investigation.\n\nBut Facebook did not directly share the ads with the American people. Instead, the House Intelligence Committee released examples of the ads ahead of congressional hearings last November.\n\n\u201cI have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal.\u201d Tweet #2\n\nNot according to the indictment.\n\nThe grand jury indictment secured by Mr. Mueller asserts that the goal of Russian operatives was to influence the 2016 election, particularly by criticizing Hillary Clinton and supporting Mr. Trump and Bernie Sanders, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s chief rival for the Democratic nomination.\n\nThe Russians \u201cengaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump,\u201d the indictment said.\n\nMr. Goldman later wrote in another tweet that \u201cthe Russian campaign was certainly in favor of Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe majority of the Russian ad spend happened AFTER the election.\u201d Tweet #3\n\nTrue, but here is some context.\n\nAccording to figures published by Facebook last October, 44 percent of the Russian-bought ads were displayed before the 2016 election, while 56 percent were shown afterward. Mr. Goldman asserted that those figures were not published by the \u201cmainstream media\u201d \u2014 however, many mainstream news outlets did print those numbers, including CNN, Reuters and The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cThe main goal of the Russian propaganda and misinformation effort is to divide America by using our institutions, like free speech and social media, against us.\u201d Tweet #4\n\nNot exactly.\n\nThe indictment does show that Russian operatives used social media \u2014 particularly Facebook \u2014 to try to sow division among Americans. But to reiterate, the indictment said that the Russians\u2019 goal was to sway the 2016 election toward a particular outcome. That aim was pursued not just through ads, which Mr. Goldman focuses on, but through Facebook pages, groups and events.\n\n\u201cThe single best demonstration of Russia\u2019s true motives is the Houston anti-islamic protest. Americans were literally puppeted into the streets by trolls who organized both the sides of protest.\u201d Tweet #5\n\nThis needs context.\n\nThe protests in Houston in May 2016 were among many rallies organized by Russian operatives through Facebook. While the Houston protest was anti-Islamic, as Mr. Goldman said, he failed to note that the goal in promoting the demonstration was to link Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign with a pro-Islamic message.\n\nAccording to the indictment secured by Mr. Mueller, there were many other examples of Russian operatives using Facebook and Instagram to organize pro-Trump rallies. At one protest, the Russian operatives paid for a cage to be built, in which an actress dressed as Mrs. Clinton posed in a prison uniform.\n\n\u201cThe Russian campaign is ongoing. Just last week saw news that Russian spies attempted to sell a fake video of Trump with a hooker to the NSA.\u201d Tweet #6\n\nTrue.\n\nAmerican intelligence officials have said that Russia has continued to target the American public and that it is already meddling in the 2018 midterm elections. The New York Times also reported this month on an attempt by a shadowy Russian figure to sell stolen American cyberweapons, as well as compromising material on President Trump, to the United States.\n\n\u201cThere are easy ways to fight this. Disinformation is ineffective against a well educated citizenry. Finland, Sweden and Holland have all taught digital literacy and critical thinking about misinformation to great effect.\u201d Tweet #7\n\nNot exactly.\n\nWhile Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands have all made efforts to teach digital literacy, those countries are still grappling with how to handle misinformation. A recent survey in Finland found that 67 percent of respondents \u201cthink fake news affects Finns\u2019 perceptions on issues \u2018a lot\u2019 or to an \u2018extreme\u2019 degree.\u201d Officials in Sweden and the Netherlands have also recently warned that fake news poses a threat to their governments.\n\n\u201cWe are also taking aggressive steps to prevent this sort of meddling in the future by requiring verification of political advertisers and by making all ads on the platform visible to anyone who cares to examine them.\u201d Tweet #8\n\nTrue.\n\nAfter initially dismissing concerns that it influenced the 2016 election, Facebook has announced a series of moves to prevent its future misuse. One of those steps includes verifying political advertisers through a system that combines automated and human fact checkers. The company has also said it plans to use postcards sent by regular mail to verify the identities of American political advertisers. Whether these new measures will be effective is unclear.\n\nCorrection : Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the month when protests organized by Russian operatives were held in Houston.

{"title": "\n                    Indictment Leaves No Doubt: Russia Backed Trump. But Was It the Difference?                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/18/us/politics/trump-election-russia.html", "text": "The dispute is especially raw because of the razor-thin margin in the election and the uncertainty over what exactly tipped the balance. Mrs. Clinton, who handily won the national popular vote, lost the Electoral College vote and therefore the presidency because Mr. Trump defeated her by less than a combined 80,000 votes in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nFew Democrats believe that Mr. Trump won solely as a result of Russia\u2019s intervention. But many think the meddling exacerbated Mrs. Clinton\u2019s challenges, making her more vulnerable to what some believe was the decisive blow: the announcement by James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director at the time, just over a week before the election that he was reopening the investigation into her use of a private email server.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cRussia succeeded in weakening her enough so that the Comey letter could knock her off,\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, who was Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign communications director.\n\nBut veterans of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign shake their head at what they believe is an abiding sense of denial among Clinton loyalists over her deficiencies.\n\n\u201cThe election was still won because Donald Trump was a better candidate with a superior message taking on a horrible candidate who people thought was corrupt,\u201d said David Bossie, a senior Trump strategist who is now president of the conservative lobbying group Citizens United. He allowed that Moscow had mounted a \u201cmalicious, disruptive campaign.\u201d\n\nNo single factor was determinative in an election that brought nearly 140 million Americans to the polls. And the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies say they do not have any way to calculate whether the Russian effort swung the election.\n\n\u201cTo credit the victory to anyone else including those 13 Russians is to demean everyday Americans\u2019 power to control their own destiny,\u201d said Stephen K. Bannon, the Trump campaign chief executive, who reportedly spent 20 hours with the team led by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in the Russia investigation, last week. \u201cThe \u2018deplorables\u2019 deserve better.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet it is difficult for Republicans to contend that the multimillion-dollar Russian intervention had no impact, with 126 million Americans being exposed to Russian-sponsored posts on Facebook alone.\n\nThe interference was not limited to the actions laid out by Mr. Mueller in the indictment of the 13 Russians linked to a \u201ctroll farm\u201d known as the Internet Research Agency.\n\nAccording to the intelligence community, the Russian government supported the email hacking of the Democratic National Committee and the personal account of John D. Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, as well as the disclosure of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s paid speeches. The committee emails, leaked just before the Democratic National Convention, helped increase the rancor between supporters of Mrs. Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nAnd the Podesta emails, leaked slowly over the month of October, were doled out selectively, with a number of exchanges held back, according to two Clinton campaign officials. While there were plenty of anodyne messages in the trove, the hackers made sure to reveal the messages that maximized the appearance of D.N.C. behavior unfairly favoring Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nFurther, a major factor in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s loss of the three crucial Rust Belt states, which every Democratic nominee had carried since 1992, was a drop-off in turnout and the performance of third-party candidates.\n\nShe could not match former President Barack Obama\u2019s turnout among blacks in cities like Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee, and the Green Party nominee, Jill Stein, captured enough votes to make up the difference between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It says that they funded social media posts that were explicitly aimed at encouraging \u201cU.S. minority groups not to vote in the 2016 U.S. presidential election or to vote for a third-party U.S. presidential candidate.\u201d\n\nFor example, the Russians created an Instagram account, \u201cWoke Blacks,\u201d and posted messages urging African-Americans not to vote at all rather than support \u201cthe lesser of two devils.\u201d They also purchased an ad on Instagram to promote a post that read: \u201cChoose peace and vote for Jill Stein. Trust me, it\u2019s not a wasted vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Stein vote alone clearly diminished Clinton\u2019s vote and some of the vote that might have gone to us in Milwaukee and stayed home was probably discouraged, and this Russia stuff played a role in that discouragement,\u201d said Paul Maslin, a Democratic pollster based in Wisconsin. \u201cOut of the 10 factors that most caused Trump to win, maybe this was only the seventh, but the fact that this is even on a relatively short list ought to be alarming.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, Republicans and even some Democrats note that the Russian meddling may not have mattered at all if Mrs. Clinton had run a better campaign. She ventured twice to Ohio in the final days of the campaign \u2014 a state she would lose by eight points \u2014 but never set foot in Wisconsin during the general election, and she made a few strategic errors in Michigan.\n\nDespite pleas from Michigan officials, her national campaign did not ask Mr. Obama to visit the state until the last day of the campaign \u2014 and it was forced to dispatch him to Ann Arbor to rally college students rather than sending him to Detroit, because a police funeral was scheduled in the city.\n\nAnd when Mrs. Clinton visited Michigan in the last days of the election, she spent some of her time in the deeply conservative and religious western part of the state trying to win over Republicans who were thought to be uneasy with Mr. Trump on moral grounds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d said Representative Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who pleaded with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign to devote more attention to the state. \u201cThe Russians clearly did things that made their way into Michigan. At the same time, as Democrats, if we\u2019re not talking about issues that matter to people, then we\u2019re not connecting with our base either.\u201d\n\nStu Sandler, a Michigan Republican strategist, was blunter: \u201cClinton didn\u2019t do enough in inner-city Detroit, and that was noticed by a lot of Democrats here.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton did spend considerable time in Pennsylvania, but she suffered there from what plagued her in the other parts of the industrial Midwest: Too many black voters stayed home, a slice of white liberals voted third-party, and many of the working-class whites who had backed Mr. Obama swung to Mr. Trump.\n\nHer environmental and gun-control policies turned off some of the state\u2019s ancestral Democrats, and the views she and her husband held in the 1990s on criminal justice depressed black turnout.\n\n\u201cShe was very unpopular here, so she didn\u2019t motivate the Democrats,\u201d said Rob Gleason, who was the state Republican chairman in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo Democrats, though, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s shortcomings were precisely what Russia preyed on to undercut her campaign.\n\n\u201cWe will never be able to know for certain if the massive Russian operation was the difference between victory and defeat,\u201d said Representative Brendan F. Boyle of Pennsylvania. \u201cBut there is one thing we absolutely can say with certainty: It was a factor. The Russians wouldn\u2019t have devoted hundreds of people and tens of millions of dollars on this operation if it wasn\u2019t having an effect.\u201d\n\nEven as Mr. Trump polarizes the country, both his admirers and detractors found themselves in agreement with one of his many Twitter observations on Sunday: that the Russians intended to sow chaos, and \u201chave succeeded beyond their wildest dreams.\u201d", "keywords": ["election", "clintons", "clinton", "russia", "mr", "vote", "difference", "doubt", "trump", "campaign", "mrs", "leaves", "russians", "michigan", "indictment", "backed"], "polarity": 0.06753924267222139, "subjectivity": 0.4347604818349497},

In the talks, the officials say, Mr. Kushner has insisted that he maintain his current level of access, including the ability to review the daily intelligence briefing when he sees fit.\n\nBut Mr. Kelly, who has been privately dismissive of Mr. Kushner since taking the post of chief of staff but has rarely taken him on directly, has made no guarantees, saying only that the president\u2019s son-in-law will still have all the access he needs to do his job under the new system.\n\n\u201cAs I told Jared days ago, I have full confidence in his ability to continue performing his duties in his foreign policy portfolio including overseeing our Israeli-Palestinian peace effort and serving as an integral part of our relationship with Mexico,\u201d Mr. Kelly said in a statement the White House released on Tuesday in which he refused to address Mr. Kushner\u2019s security clearance or elaborate on his memo.\n\n\u201cEveryone in the White House is grateful for these valuable contributions to furthering the president\u2019s agenda,\u201d Mr. Kelly said of Mr. Kushner. \u201cThere is no truth to any suggestion otherwise.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear whether Mr. Kushner would need to review highly classified information. His current portfolio \u2014 which includes acting as an intermediary with Mexico, trying to forge Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, participating in an economic dialogue with China and working on revising the North American Free Trade Agreement \u2014 seems unlikely to involve major intelligence or national security secrets. But Mr. Kushner, by dint of his relationship with Mr. Trump, has wide-ranging access to the president and the information that he sees, and senior advisers to the president typically require such access to perform their duties.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThe fact that the White House chief of staff would take the step of publicly denying that a policy change would harm the president\u2019s son-in-law pointed up the tension in the West Wing after the Porter episode, particularly between Mr. Kelly on one side, and Mr. Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, who had been close allies of Mr. Porter, on the other.\n\nMr. Kushner and Ms. Trump have been critical of Mr. Kelly in conversations with the president, who spent the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla. surveying people about whether he should fire his chief of staff. However, since Mr. Porter\u2019s departure, one official said, Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump have told people around the White House that they have been vocal in their attempts to defend Mr. Kelly but are being treated unfairly in return.\n\nOne person familiar with Mr. Kushner\u2019s thinking, who insisted on anonymity to describe it, denied that he felt personally targeted by Mr. Kelly or was agitating to have him removed. Another White House official denied that Mr. Kushner had ever raised the issue of the intelligence summary in his discussions with Mr. Kelly over his clearance.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the memo, deliberately or otherwise, has shone an unflattering light on Mr. Kushner, raising questions about whether he can be effective in his post and how much authority he has. That debate threatens to complicate what Mr. Kelly has acknowledged is a long-overdue effort inside the White House to get a handle on the clearance process, a national security imperative over which top officials appear to have placed little priority after Mr. Trump took office.\n\n\u201cWe should \u2014 and in the future, must \u2014 do better,\u201d Mr. Kelly said in his memo last week.\n\nThe questions surrounding Mr. Kushner\u2019s clearance are particularly acute because of the possibility that his extensive contacts with foreign actors \u2014 including travel, meetings with leaders overseas and multiple business ventures \u2014 might be relevant to the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nMr. Kushner initially failed to disclose scores of those contacts on the standard form required for all prospective government officials, and has since amended his submission, substantially delaying his background check.\n\nThat meant that his background information was not submitted in its entirety until June, after the June 1 cutoff that Mr. Kelly set in his memo.\n\nUnder the new policy, anyone holding interim clearance to see top secret or sensitive compartmented information whose background investigation had been pending since then is to be stripped of that access by Friday. Even if Mr. Kushner was not in that initial group, the document suggested that his status would soon be reviewed, and that his access going forward would be subject entirely to Mr. Kelly\u2019s discretion.\n\n\u201cSimilar reviews will occur monthly for long-outstanding adjudications,\u201d Mr. Kelly wrote. The new rules, he said, would \u201climit access to certain highly classified information for those individuals working with interim clearance status absent explicit chief of staff\u2019s office approval, which would be granted only in the most compelling circumstances.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["information", "kushner", "tackles", "house", "kelly", "issues", "mr", "white", "access", "trump", "clearance", "resists", "losing", "security"], "polarity": 0.08080592567605555, "subjectivity": 0.38820796087029846},

But policymakers don\u2019t agree on what a leave plan should look like. Now some Republicans have a new idea: Let people collect Social Security benefits early to pay for time off after they have a baby.\n\nUnlike some other proposals, this would require no new taxes. There\u2019s a catch, though: Parents would have their Social Security benefits delayed when they retire to offset the costs.\n\nSocial Security has long been viewed as an untouchable part of the social safety net. By letting people tap it for parental leave, it would begin to feel more like an individual account \u2014 an idea conservatives have been trying to advance for decades.\n\nImage Senator Joni Ernst said she supported the idea because it would provide an option for new mothers who might otherwise leave the work force. Credit Eric Thayer for The New York Times\n\nThe new parental leave plan comes from a right-leaning group called the Independent Women\u2019s Forum, and its president, Carrie Lukas, who said Social Security was based on an antiquated idea of working life. \u201cWomen are a bigger part of the work force now, and they need support at different times of their lives rather than just starting at 67,\u201d she said.\n\nMore broadly, Ms. Lukas has said that she hoped the proposal would \u201cencourage an important mental shift\u201d in the way people think about Social Security. If individuals view it as \u201cproperty,\u201d she reasons, it could lead to the embrace of personal accounts.\n\nThat reasoning is why some experts view the proposal as a backdoor way to try to curb the scale and cost of Social Security. They also said it could put women in a more precarious position in retirement, adding yet another financial penalty to the list that women pay when they become mothers. Women have lower earnings, smaller Social Security benefits and less financial security in retirement because they spend a disproportionate amount of time away from work to raise children, research shows. Drawing down their Social Security benefits early could compound the problem.\n\n\u201cHere you have a situation where women live longer, but they tend to live both sicker and poorer because of the caregiving they do,\u201d said Debra Ness, president of the National Partnership for Women & Families, a nonprofit that champions women\u2019s economic security. \u201cWith this proposal, we would be asking them to borrow against the already inadequate support they receive from Social Security.\u201d\n\nSenator Joni Ernst of Iowa, a supporter of the idea, said it would provide women with more financial security by encouraging them to stay in the work force after they have children. \u201cI think about those women that will leave the work force because that\u2019s their only option, and this provides them a way to take some time off, spend time devoted to their family and then return,\u201d she said.\n\nThe new proposal is one of several being considered by Ivanka Trump and others in the White House to expand paid leave beyond the 13 percent of workers who have access to it through their employers.\n\nThey are studying if the Social Security Administration can be used to administer paid leave, according to people briefed on their discussions. It could allow people to collect payments early, as in the plan Ms. Ernst spoke of, or it could administer a new fund, perhaps financed by payroll taxes, an idea some Democrats have proposed. The administration\u2019s goal is to get bipartisan support on what has historically not been a Republican issue.\n\nThree Republican senators \u2014 Ms. Ernst, Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah \u2014 announced this month that they supported the Social Security proposal, though they were still researching it and had not yet started writing a bill.\n\nImage Senator Marco Rubio, left, and Senator Mike Lee also support the proposal, although Mr. Lee voiced concern about the future of Social Security. Credit T.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York Times\n\nIn a conference call, the senators praised the fact that the plan would not force businesses to provide leave, would not start a new government program and would not raise taxes.\n\nBut Mr. Lee also raised concerns about the underfunding of Social Security, and whether this would accelerate its decline. That is the most controversial aspec t of the proposal, experts said, because it would apply more stress to a program that is already under pressure.\n\nStarting in 2034, Social Security will be able to pay only 75 percent of scheduled benefits, according to the latest trustees report, unless taxes are raised or benefits are trimmed. And while the chances of passing any legislation in an election year are dim, the proposal introduces a new strain of thinking about what Social Security can be used for. Another legislator, Representative Thomas Garrett, a Republican from Virginia, recently introduced a bill that would let individuals draw Social Security benefits early to pay off a portion of their student loans.\n\nMillions of retirees rely on modest checks from the program, which was created from a bill signed into law by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935. Treating Social Security as something that can be borrowed against suggests that it can be treated as an individual account rather than a social insurance program. That could open the door to privatizing the accounts, some experts said, an idea that was floated during George W. Bush\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cThis is a significant philosophy shift that doesn\u2019t look at it like an insurance program where we are all in it together, but an individual asset you can tap to pay for your individual needs,\u201d said Kathleen Romig, senior policy analyst at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nThe proposal would also begin to reshape Social Security into something more akin to 401(k) accounts: Account holders can borrow against their 401(k), or even drain it in a financial emergency (albeit with a penalty), leaving them with less savings for retirement.\n\nSocial Security, in contrast, cannot be touched and is often viewed as the last standing leg in the three-legged stool of retirement, when personal savings are not enough and pensions are increasingly rare.\n\nTo be eligible for the proposed program, a new parent would need to have a minimum amount of earnings in the years before claiming the benefit, similar to the formula used to qualify for Social Security disability benefits , according to the proposal from the Independent Women\u2019s Forum.\n\nThe size of the benefit would be calculated borrowing a formula from Social Security. A 26-year-old woman earning $31,000, for example, might receive roughly $1,175 a month in Social Security parental benefits, which replaces about 45 percent of her income, for up to 12 weeks.\n\nThe cost would come later, in the form of a reduced retirement benefit. Exactly how the reduction would be calculated is not yet entirely clear, said Andrew Biggs, a former principal deputy commissioner of the Social Security Administration who helped devise the proposal and who is now at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. But roughly speaking, he said, a 12-week leave would most likely translate to a benefit cut of 1.5 percent.\n\nThe proposal says that a parent\u2019s Social Security check would be delayed, not cut, to offset the amount gained during the paid leave.\n\nMs. Lukas said that delaying Social Security would not be a problem for most people: \u201cSixty-seven is really late middle age, and many people are really happy to continue working.\u201d\n\nYet many workers do not have a choice. And while life expectancies have increased, better-paid and more educated people tend to live longer than those who earn less.\n\nAs of now, the proposal covers new parents but not workers who are recovering from an illness or need to care for other family members. It also does not provide job security for people who take leave. The Family and Medical Leave Act does both those things, but the leave is unpaid, and only about half of workers qualify for it.\n\nThe Family Act, a bill sponsored in the Senate by Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, would create a new fund within the Social Security Administration. Employers and employees would each contribute 0.2 percent of their wages for 12 weeks of paid parental, family or medical leave.\n\nRepublicans generally object to proposals that would raise taxes, but any paid leave plan would need to be paid for. The question now facing policymakers is whether to turn t o Social Security payments, the last guaranteed safety net for many retirees, to do so.\n\nTara Siegel Bernard is a personal finance reporter.

Azar II, the new secretary of health and human services, drafted the new rules with the Treasury and Labor Departments. Credit Lawrence Jackson for The New York Times\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration took another swipe at the Affordable Care Act on Tuesday, proposing new rules that would make it much easier for consumers to buy less expensive health insurance policies that do not comply with coverage requirements of the law.\n\nUnder current rules, such \u201cshort-term, limited-duration insurance\u201d cannot last for more than three months. Under the proposal, the limit would be 364 days.\n\nThe move carries out an executive order by President Trump, who said the change would benefit consumers because \u201cshort-term, limited-duration insurance is exempt from the onerous and expensive insurance mandates and regulations\u201d in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAlex M. Azar II, the new secretary of health and human services, said the proposed rules would provide additional options to people who could not afford to pay current insurance premiums.\n\n\u201cAmericans need more choices in health insurance so they can find coverage that meets their needs,\u201d Mr. Azar said Tuesday. \u201cThe status quo is failing too many Americans who face skyrocketing costs and fewer and fewer choices.\u201d\n\nShort-term policies are intended for people who are between jobs or need temporary coverage for other reasons. They are generally cheaper than insurance that meets the law\u2019s requirements, but they offer significantly less protection to consumers.\n\nInsurers often deny short-term policies to people with pre-existing conditions and can charge higher premiums because of such conditions. Short-term policies do not have to provide the \u201cessential health benefits\u201d that are required by the Affordable Care Act. They may, for example, omit coverage of maternity care, mental health care or addiction treatment. Short-term policies may impose limits on the amount the insurer will pay, but they do not have to cap the patient\u2019s out-of-pocket costs.\n\nIn addition, people who buy short-term medical coverage are not eligible for the subsidies provided to low- and middle-income people who buy insurance through the marketplaces set up under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDemocrats denounced the proposal as another attempt by Mr. Trump to sabotage the Affordable Care Act. Republicans called it a potential lifeline for victims of the law who have been priced out of the market.\n\nSenator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, said the Trump administration was promoting \u201cjunk insurance.\u201d The House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, said people buying these plans could be \u201cone diagnosis away from disaster, discovering they have been paying for coverage that may not cover basic care such as cancer treatment.\u201d\n\nSome health policy experts say that if large numbers of healthy people buy short-term coverage, it could drive up premiums for those who remain in Affordable Care Act plans.\n\nThe Trump administration said these concerns were unfounded. But in a preamble to the proposed rules, it said, \u201cIndividuals who are likely to purchase short-term, limited-duration insurance are likely to be relatively young or healthy.\u201d\n\nAnd if those consumers develop chronic conditions, it said, they could \u201cface financial hardship\u201d until they enroll in more comprehensive plans that comply with the 2010 law.\n\nSome insurers worry that consumers will be confused and may see short-term policies as a substitute for major medical coverage.\n\n\u201cExpanded use of short-term policies could further fragment the individual market, which would lead to higher premiums for many consumers, particularly those with pre-existing conditions,\u201d said Kristine Grow, a spokeswoman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group for insurers.\n\nBut Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, welcomed the announcement as an important step to \u201cexpand consumer choice, competition and access to health care.\u201d\n\nSeema Verma, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said that \u201cwe don\u2019t think there\u2019s any validity\u201d to concerns that the proposed rules would destabilize insurance markets.\n\nRather, she said, the short-term policies could appeal to healthy people who are \u201csitting on the sidelines without coverage.\u201d\n\nThe administration estimates that short-term plans may cost about one-third as much as unsubsidized comprehensive coverage.\n\nUnder the proposed rules, short-term policies would have to carry a disclosure: \u201cThis coverage is not required to comply with federal requirements for health insurance, principally those contained in the Affordable Care Act. Be sure to check your policy carefully to make sure you understand what the policy does and doesn\u2019t cover.\u201d\n\nPeople will have until April 23 to comment on the proposal. Mr. Azar said he hoped to issue final rules by \u201cmid- to late-spring.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration predicted that issuers of short-term insurance would experience \u201can increase in premium revenues and profits\u201d because they could set prices to reflect the risk that an individual consumer would have high medical costs.\n\nThree cabinet departments \u2014 Treasury, labor and health and human services \u2014 drafted the proposed rules after Mr. Trump\u2019s order in October, when he said he was saving people from \u201cthe nightmare of Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s action represents an important promise kept by the president,\u201d Mr. Azar said Tuesday.\n\nSenator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, said the short-term policies provided a useful alternative to costly major medical coverage that complied with the 2010 health law. Consumers, he said, need \u201cmore, not fewer, health insurance options.\u201d\n\nBut Mike Kreidler, the state insurance commissioner in Washington State, said short-term medical plans posed risks for consumers.\n\n\u201cIf you get sick,\u201d Mr. Kreidler said, \u201cyou may not be able to renew your coverage \u2014 there are no protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Maternity care and mental-health benefits often are excluded.\u201d\n\nShort-term insurance had long been defined, by states and the federal government, as coverage lasting less than 12 months. But the Obama administration changed that in late 2016, after concluding that some insurers were abusing short-term plans and keeping healthier consumers out of the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.\n\nTrump administration officials said that short-term insurance policies had become increasingly important because premiums more than doubled, on average, from 2013 to 2017 for health plans on the federal insurance exchange.\n\nSign Up for the Morning Briefing Get what you need to know to start your day in the United States, Canada and the Americas, delivered to your inbox.

And it is expected to get progressively heavier, as the budget deficit swells.\n\nTo top it off, a Republican president and a Republican Congress seem set on completing the longstanding Republican project to gut the safety net built by Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson, which they blame for encouraging sloth, and replace it with a leaner welfare regime that closely ties government benefits to hard work.\n\nAs noted in a new set of proposals by leading academics to combat poverty, published Tuesday by the Russell Sage Foundation, anti-poverty policies and related social-welfare benefits over the last quarter-century \u201chave largely shifted from a system of guaranteed income support to a work-based safety net.\u201d\n\nThe economists Hilary Hoynes of the University of California, Berkeley, and Marianne Bitler of the University of California, Davis, pointed out in a recent paper that \u201cthe safety net for low-income families with children has transformed from one subsidizing out-of-work families into one subsidizing in-work families.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, as many unemployed Americans discovered the last time recession hit, government benefits that require recipients to hold a job become worthless when there is no work to be had.\n\nConsider what happened the last time around, when the bursting of the housing bubble pushed millions of workers out of their jobs. The Fed quickly slashed interest rates to zero. Months later it started buying billions of dollars\u2019 worth of bonds from financial institutions to lower long-term interest rates and encourage borrowing.\n\nThe Obama administration hurried to cobble together an economic stimulus package of more than $1 trillion to get money to families that needed it most. It expanded the eligibility for unemployment insurance to its longest duration ever, 99 weeks. It raised the earned-income tax credit for low-wage workers. It more than doubled the budget for food stamps \u2014 the poor\u2019s last line of defense.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But the administration\u2019s intervention to bolster the nation\u2019s welfare programs made a decisive difference for millions who otherwise would have fallen through the cracks of the nation\u2019s threadbare safety net.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUsing a broad definition of income and poverty that includes the effects of the complete array of government tools to support low-income families, Professors Hoynes and Bitler concluded that food stamps were critical to stem poverty.\n\nHad food stamps not been available, they estimated, the share of Americans under 65 living below the poverty line would have exceeded 11 percent in 2010, almost 1.5 percentage points more than was the case. The share of Americans in extreme poverty \u2014 with less than half the resources of the simply poor \u2014 would have exceeded 4 percent, about a third more than it turned out to be. Unemployment insurance had a roughly similar impact on poverty levels.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat is critical to note is that each of the two programs did more to relieve extreme poverty during the depths of the Great Recession than even the earned-income tax credit, the main source of government support for low-income Americans.\n\nIndeed, expenditures per capita from the earned-income tax credit increased only modestly after the recession hit. And spending by Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the patchwork of state-run programs that emerged from welfare reform in 1996 to replace the poor\u2019s entitlement to federal cash assistance, did not respond to the recession at all.\n\nThis is a problem for vulnerable Americans bracing for the next economic shock, because if Mr. Trump and his colleagues in Congress have their way, the only surviving bit of the social safety net when the next recession hits will probably require beneficiaries to work. The earned-income tax credit is likely to survive unscathed. Food stamps are not.\n\nAssiduously looking for places to cut spending to temper a growing budget deficit, the White House seems more than willing to pare the safety net. The budget it unveiled this month called for a 27 percent cut to the food stamp budget and a 20 percent cut to Section 8 housing assistance by 2028.\n\nThe administration already allows states to impose work requirements on Medicaid beneficiaries to shave the program\u2019s costs. And the latest White House budget requested a 22.5 percent cut to Medicaid and Obamacare subsidies by 2028 by repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhile the Trump administration is unlikely to end unemployment insurance, the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program expired at the end of 2013. In some states, benefits expire in as little as 12 weeks.\n\nPolicy could change in the face of a new economic downturn, to be sure. There are plenty of places where the social safety net could be improved. The Russell Sage proposals include everything from a universal child allowance to a renter\u2019s tax credit; from subsidizing employment to a public works program paying a living wage.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet somehow I can\u2019t see Mr. Trump and Republican allies like the House speaker, Paul D.

Mr. Porter has also privately told people that he believes the security clearance debacle says more about the dysfunction at the White House than it does about his behavior.\n\nMr. Porter declined to comment for this story. This account is based on interviews with two dozen people, many of whom would not be named because they still work in politics, who were not authorized to comment or were reluctant to speak publicly in his defense.\n\nThe elder Mr. Porter, a former aide to Presidents Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan and a Harvard professor since 1977, set high expectations for his oldest son, who followed his father\u2019s blueprint closely. Both were Rhodes scholars.\n\nThe family spent years gathering for dinners and events at the red brick Dunster House dormitory on the Harvard campus, where the elder Mr. Porter was a master. Mr. Porter\u2019s mother, who died in 2017, was the faculty dean of Dunster House, along the banks of the Charles River.\n\nThe family kept a home in Belmont, Mass., the town where the construction of a 69,600-square-foot Mormon temple was completed in 2000. The Porters socialized with other prominent Mormon families, full of high-achieving children and known to compete with each other. Mr. Porter and his three siblings were competitive, too \u2014 his youngest sister was the only Porter sibling not to attend Harvard.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTally Zingher, another former classmate, described Mr. Porter as \u201can upstanding guy driven by morals.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy memory of him is \u2018totally positive golden boy,\u2019\u201d Ms. Zingher added.\n\nIn 2000, Mr. Porter started dating his first wife, Colbie Holderness, who publicly accused him this month of abuse.\n\nPhoto\n\nOthers from his time in school or professional settings described being stunned at the allegations. Melissa Langsam Braunstein, a former vice president of the Harvard Republican Club who overlapped with Mr. Porter there, said he had a picture-perfect image at Harvard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unsettling, shocking and surprising,\u201d she said in an interview.\n\nMr. Porter graduated from Harvard in 2002 with a degree in government. According to The Harvard Gazette, a magazine published by the university, he chaired the university\u2019s chapter of Students for Bush, in addition to his work with the Republican Club.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The two were in love but sometimes argued over Mr. Porter\u2019s ambition, according to two people who were close to both during their marriage. In 2005, Ms. Holderness said that Mr. Porter punched her while the two were on vacation in Europe, and that he later took photos of a black eye she sustained during their argument. In 2008, Mr. Porter and Ms. Holderness divorced.\n\nBy late 2009, he was married to Jennifer Willoughby. Months later, she filed a restraining order against him for trying to enter her apartment while they were separated.\n\nThrough his personal struggles, Mr. Porter had support from his father, whose influence in Washington helped him secure jobs there.\n\n\u201cHis dad had a very strong hand in decisions that he made,\u201d Ms. Willoughby recalled, \u201cand also sometimes made connections for Rob.\u201d She, like his first wife, is Mormon as well.\n\nWhen he arrived on Capitol Hill in 2011, Mr. Porter was seen by many who knew him as confident and capable. Several colleagues say Mr. Porter was a consummate professional. As a chief counsel for Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, Mr. Porter reprimanded an aide who made an inappropriate comment toward a woman who worked in the office, according to two people who worked there at the time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Rob for several years, as both a friend and a co-worker,\u201d Ellen James, who worked with Mr. Porter in Mr. Lee\u2019s office, wrote in an email. \u201cI was never aware of any of the allegations that have become public over the last few days. To my knowledge, he always treated everyone with the utmost respect and professionalism in the workplace.\u201d\n\nKevin Smith, a spokesman for Senator Rob Portman, the Republican of Ohio in whose office Mr. Porter briefly worked as general counsel, said in a statement that no indication of inappropriate behavior was seen during Mr. Porter\u2019s time there.\n\nAfter working in Mr. Portman\u2019s office, Mr. Porter took the chief of staff job with Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, in 2014. According to two aides who worked with him there, Mr. Porter was arrogant and overly ambitious, even in a town that seems to have limitless capacity for both. He would occasionally lose his temper and become red in the face when he found himself on the losing end of a workplace argument, the aides said.\n\nAs he worked his way through Capitol Hill, Mr. Porter went through his second divorce in 2013. At some point during that separation, friends say Mr. Porter began to be less active within his Mormon community and began drinking, which is discouraged in the faith.\n\nTwo friends of Mr. Porter\u2019s, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation for appearing to defend him, said that Mr. Porter had at times struggled to reconcile a stringent religious background with his failed marriages. To be divorced once in the Mormon faith is unusual, they both said, and to be divorced twice is rare.\n\nUsually private about his personal life \u2014 few who knew him, including his colleagues at the White House, were even aware he had been married twice \u2014 he mentioned to at least one former colleague on Capitol Hill that he would never marry a Mormon woman again.\n\nAt the White House, Mr. Porter was seen as a capable, if somewhat overeager, presence. The former White House official said that Mr. Porter had been discussed as a possibility as deputy chief of staff, but it was unclear whether his issues obtaining a security clearance prevented him from advancing.\n\nQuestions remain over who knew what, and when, about the investigation into Mr. Porter\u2019s background, including John F. Kelly, the chief of staff, and Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel. Late last year, a distraught girlfriend told Mr. McGahn that Mr. Porter had anger problems, according to people familiar with the conversation.\n\nMr. McGahn, who knew the woman, raised the issue with Mr. Porter, but did not follow up.", "keywords": ["ambition", "charisma", "disguised", "republican", "anger", "rob", "house", "mr", "white", "harvard", "mormon", "ms", "porters", "flareups", "porter", "worked"], "polarity": 0.06179723502304147, "subjectivity": 0.3278957780570683},

But conservatives who believed his presidency would be more of a sharp break with the Bush years are starting to express alarm. And their concern could indicate trouble for Mr. Trump if his more conventional approach on some policy issues alienates his base and depresses Republican turnout in the midterm elections in November.\n\n\u201cRight at the point when everyone was thinking in my world that things were just going swimmingly, there are some good and important questions being raised,\u201d said Matt Schlapp, president of the American Conservative Union, which this week will host Mr. Trump as a speaker at its annual Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nOthers have been less generous. Mark Levin, the right-wing talk show host who is also set to speak at CPAC, recently asked his audience, \u201cIs conservatism dead?\u201d and accused lawmakers of \u201cspending like drunken Marxists.\u201d\n\nEven some Trump allies who were initially slow to trust him \u2014 precisely because they worried about his fidelity to conservative principles \u2014 are voicing skepticism. \u201cI hope this makes conservatives across the country realize that right now, they aren\u2019t getting what they voted for in Washington,\u201d Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who clashed bitterly with Mr. Trump during the 2016 Republican primaries but is now one of the president\u2019s confidants, wrote in an essay for Time.com.\n\nThe deficits that Mr. Trump and the Republican-led Congress just approved, added Mr. Paul, who was an early Tea Party star, \u201dwould make President Obama cringe.\u201d\n\nMany Republicans do indeed prefer the more accommodating version of the president when it comes to most policies. And despite the extraordinary aspects of his presidency, Mr. Trump has approached governing in a way that bears strikingly similar parallels to Mr. Bush and Ronald Reagan.\n\nOne of Mr. Bush\u2019s first official acts as president in January 2001 was to reinstate the Mexico City Policy, a global gag rule implemented under Mr. Reagan that withholds American aid from health organizations worldwide that provide or even discuss abortion in family planning. Just three days into his administration, Mr. Trump did the same thing. The White House has since sought to expand the order.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s orders that government departments must safeguard religious liberties have echoes of Mr. Bush\u2019s efforts to promote \u201cfaith-based\u201d initiatives through special administrative offices in 11 federal agencies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s effort to comb law schools and courtrooms across the country for young, unfailingly conservative nominees to the federal bench resembles the campaign Mr. Reagan undertook to leave an enduring rightward imprint on the courts.\n\nMr. Trump has also shown a great degree of deference to the military he once vowed to pull back from foreign conflict. Last year, he signed off on a troop surge in Afghanistan and he permitted the Pentagon to loosen its rules of engagement that dictate how the armed forces can pursue targets in places like Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. Military officials had complained the Obama White House\u2019s rules prevented them from moving quickly and effectively enough.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

One of his most dramatic announcements to date, withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, had little practical effect because Congress never ratified it. And last week the Commerce Department said the nation\u2019s trade deficit with China, the official measure of how many goods American businesses import compared with exports, was the highest on record.\n\nOn health care Mr. Trump has even proposed ways to lower prescription drug costs, reminiscent of Mr. Bush\u2019s Medicare Part D.\n\nIn Mr. Trump\u2019s more conventional policies, Republicans see something they do not usually find in this White House: reassurance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons someone like me \u2014 who was in the \u2018Never Trump\u2019 camp and who ultimately didn\u2019t vote for Donald Trump \u2014 finds a lot in Donald Trump to like,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush\u2019s former press secretary.\n\nMany have come to accept Mr. Trump as someone who operates on two tracks, Mr. Fleischer added. \u201cThere\u2019s the policy track,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s the personal behavior track, which sets him so far apart that it risks drowning the rest out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere are many ways, however, in which Mr. Trump has actually gone much further than his Republican predecessors in pursuing conservative policy goals \u2014 especially in the environmental and regulatory realm. Mr. Bush, for instance, appointed a moderate Republican governor from a heavily Democratic state to lead his Environmental Protection Agency, Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey. Mr. Trump named the attorney general of Oklahoma, Scott Pruitt, who had sued the agency multiple times.\n\nMr. Trump pulled out of the Paris climate accord and announced his intention to move the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem \u2014 moves most Republicans say other conservative presidents would likely have found too unsettling.\n\nBut if once-skeptical Republicans can find reasons in Mr. Trump\u2019s policies to look the other way on some of his personal shortcomings, there are also many who see little to like about his similarities with Mr. Bush, who turned budget surpluses into gaping deficits and helped spark the Republican backlash that became the Tea Party movement.\n\nMany activists have been ratcheting up the pressure. In response to Mr. Trump\u2019s signing the budget agreement and his embrace of a pathway to citizenship for younger immigrants brought here illegally as children, the Tea Party Patriots, one of the president\u2019s most reliable supporters, said conservative voters were not getting what they signed up for.\n\n\u201cThere is a sense of frustration among a lot of people who supported President Trump from the very beginning of his campaign,\u201d said Jenny Beth Martin, the group\u2019s president. \u201cThey feel a bit betrayed and they don\u2019t feel like President Trump is keeping his promise.\u201d", "keywords": ["republican", "bushs", "policy", "party", "mr", "trump", "conventional", "president", "conservative", "republicans", "approach", "edges", "trumps"], "polarity": 0.10179344465058751, "subjectivity": 0.4000055216891951},

Still, support has grown even among Democrats, from 8 percent just before the bill passed in December to 19 percent this month. For Democrats, Mr. Cohen said, running on opposition to the bill has become more of a political gamble.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s less of a sure bet than it seemed in December,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a problem yet for Democrats, but the movement isn\u2019t a positive one.\u201d\n\nOther recent polls have shown similar upswings for the law, including a Monmouth University Poll in late January that found support for it had risen to 44 percent nationally, from 26 percent in December.\n\n\u201cI think we are essentially seeing Republicans \u2018come home\u2019 on the tax plan in our data,\u201d said Lori Weigel, a partner with Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican polling firm. \u201cThat is certainly in part due to consistent communications about the tax plan and the news coverage of prominent companies investing in workers.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have done little to counter the Republican messaging and concede it has had an effect, along with a series of high-profile company announcements of bonuses, raises or other benefits attributed to tax savings.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut they are ramping up efforts to rebrand the law as disproportionately helping shareholders and the wealthy, and they contend the boost from bonus announcements will fade.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only so long you can push a one-time bonus,\u201d said Nicole Gill, executive director of Tax March, a liberal group that has organized rallies and protests against the new law. \u201cThe fundamentals of the bill remain the same. The bill that passed is the bill that polled at 35 percent in December, and Democrats should keep talking about that.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Times polling suggests that Americans are overestimating the degree to which the benefits of the law\u2019s corporate tax cuts are flowing straight to workers \u2014 while underestimating the likelihood that the law will reduce their individual taxes.\n\nJust under one in five respondents expect to see either a raise or a bonus thanks to the law\u2019s business tax cuts. Early returns from public companies indicate that\u2019s an overshot. Just Capital, a nonprofit research organization, analyzed the 90 largest public companies that have announced how they will spend the combined $45 billion in savings they stand to receive from the tax bill this year. It found that those companies planned to pass 6 percent of those savings directly on to workers, with more than half of that spending in one-time bonuses.\n\n\u201cThat does not really track to how the public thinks the companies should be spending that money,\u201d said Martin Whittaker, Just Capital\u2019s chief executive.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The independent Tax Policy Center in Washington estimates that four in five Americans will actually see a tax cut from the law this year, though that number is projected to shrink sharply in 2027 if individual tax cuts expire as scheduled in the law.\n\nRepublicans are confident that support will continue to grow as more Americans see lower taxes reflected in their paychecks. Their confidence was reflected last week by Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, who cited Senator Heidi Heitkamp\u2019s vote against the tax bill when announcing he would run for her seat.\n\n\u201cThere is no question the tax bill has fundamentally improved the overall political environment for Republicans,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a former campaign manager and chief of staff for Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, who is now president of the public affairs firm Cavalry in Washington.\n\nClose to half of Americans now expect some direct benefit from the law \u2014 either a tax cut or a salary increase or bonus.

A few days ago, she called a contractor to move forward with a long-delayed plan to replace the roof on her house.

She\u2019s been working about 30 hours a week at the outlet mall and a small remodeling firm while looking for a job with good benefits in communications or marketing.\n\nHer husband, Matt, started his contracting business a few years ago and is finishing his undergraduate degree with the help of a loan. They bought a 1750s farmhouse just before they married; Ms. Hurd returned to work when their son, Harry, was eight weeks old.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThough roughly the same age, Ms. DiCola has followed a different course. She dropped out of the Manhattan School of Music in 2009 after her freshman year because she couldn\u2019t keep up with the tuition. Now, to supplement the scant income she gets from singing gigs, she drives for Uber and Lyft a few nights a week, sometimes more, in Boston. She earned about $15,000 last year, making sure she stayed under the threshold to qualify for Medicaid.\n\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s no different from what corporations do all the time, taking advantage of tax breaks and that sort of thing,\u201d Ms. DiCola, a soprano who talks animatedly about Verdi and Puccini, said of being on Medicaid. \u201cFrankly, if they\u2019re allowed to do it, why shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMedical care has been easy to access on Medicaid. She got physical therapy for an old injury, and when she needed to have an IUD surgically removed last year, she went to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Hanover, the state\u2019s most prestigious hospital. She paid for none of it. She spends most of her income on paying off her car, a used 2012 Prius with 160,000 miles on it, and her last outstanding student loan.\n\n\u201cThe coverage is actually really good,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just kind of finding my way, so the health insurance is so helpful.\u201d\n\nFor Ms. Hurd, health care has been something to avoid since she and her husband got the marketplace plan shortly after Harry\u2019s birth last year. (Before that, she had a job with benefits but quit because of her difficult pregnancy.) She went to an urgent care clinic for a throat culture last fall because unlike at her primary care practice, she could find out the cost, $150, upfront. And when Harry was up all night sobbing with a fever recently, she hesitated briefly before seeking medical help, again at urgent care.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The story was about a report that found Medicaid recipients used health care more aggressively than marketplace customers, presumably because their coverage was free.\n\nInstead of giving its new Medicaid recipients traditional coverage through the program, New Hampshire uses Medicaid funds to buy them private plans through the Obamacare marketplace. The report, by an independent actuarial firm, found that average medical costs for the state\u2019s expansion population were 26 percent higher than for the marketplace\u2019s other customers in 2016.\n\nThe firm found this raised average claim costs \u2014 a proxy for premiums \u2014 for everyone by 14 percent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne of the conditions that Gov. Chris Sununu has attached to continuing expanded Medicaid here is that most adult recipients without a disability or small children will have to work, volunteer or get job training, at least 20 hours a week. New Hampshire is among eight Republican-controlled states asking the Trump administration for approval to impose work requirements; two others, Kentucky and Indiana, already got permission last month.\n\nMs. Hurd \u2014 who says she thinks \u201cwork is everything, honestly\u201d \u2014 is elated about the possibility.\n\n\u201cIf there were actual repercussions aside from your personal self-worth \u2014 like \u2018Hey, you may not be able to get the pills you need\u2019 \u2014 people might be more inclined to work,\u201d she said.\n\nBut research has found that most Medicaid recipients without disabilities, like Ms. DiCola, already work at least part-time.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI know I live with my parents, but I\u2019m not going on fancy trips or anything like that \u2014 I feel guilty when I buy a new lipstick,\u201d she said. She worried when she had the flu in December and lost four days of income, she said, adding, \u201cI\u2019d like not to feel like I\u2019m constantly so close to the edge.\u201d\n\nMs. DiCola started driving for Uber and Lyft three years ago, after stints at a Panera and a train station cafe. She often shuttles customers around Boston until after midnight, making up to $25 an hour \u2014 enough to pay two or three times more than the $87.50 she owes on her student loan each month, plus buy gas. Her days include pitching in on cooking and other household duties, auditions, rehearsals and studying musical scores on her couch, a cat or two by her side. She hopes to get a college degree, find a more stable career and get access to employer health coverage. But for now, with a free place to live and with Medicaid, she said, \u201cI\u2019m able to throw all my money at paying off my debt.\u201d\n\nAnxiety and Peace of Mind\n\nMs. Hurd is a former Republican who volunteered for Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign in 2012 and voted for Carly Fiorina in the 2016 primary, but now describes her politics as more libertarian. She\u2019s pro-immigration, not least because she sees immigrants as having strong work ethics. She voted for Hillary Clinton in the general election, she said, because she finds President Trump deeply offensive, a \u201cguy who bullied his way into power.\u201d\n\nHer father, a Trump voter from the Boston suburbs, sends her articles that are critical of the health law, and they resonate with her.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven members of her own family take advantage of a flawed system, in her view, by getting Medicaid. \u201cThey don\u2019t work because they don\u2019t want to, and they get free health insurance.\u201d She said. \u201cWhat the heck? If my husband and I, who grew up with relatively middle-class backgrounds in wealthy states, know people that mooch off the system in our immediate families, imagine what it\u2019s like elsewhere.\u201d\n\nMs. DiCola\u2019s father, a solo-practice lawyer, is also a Trump supporter, but she is a liberal Democrat and uneasily aware of the anger and frustration that unsubsidized Obamacare customers are feeling \u2014 so much so that at first, she worried about sharing her story with The New York Times and \u201cbeing dragged through the mud on some 24-hour news channel\u201d for being on Medicaid.\n\nShe described her state\u2019s plan to impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients as \u201cpoor-shaming.\u201d Her friends show more empathy, she said. When she needed a root canal and crown last year and Medicaid would not have paid for it (dental care is one area that Medicaid does not cover comprehensively, or sometimes at all), she posted about it on Facebook and her friends jumped in to help.\n\nMs. DiCola doesn\u2019t expect to need much health care this year \u2014 just a physical and a new pair of glasses, which Medicaid will cover, she said. Still, she added, \u201cYou never know what could come up \u2014 my appendix could decide to burst tomorrow.\u201d In which case, Medicaid would cover the emergency room visit, surgery and hospital stay, a huge relief to Ms. DiCola, who became so anxious as Republicans in Congress tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act last summer that she felt physically ill.\n\nMs. Hurd has had no such peace of mind. A burst appendix would likely cost at least her individual deductible of $6,300.\n\nBy late January, Ms. Hurd had begun to believe that the only way for her family to have any access to health care was to drop their insurance and save the $928 a month to spend on care when they need it. Harry\u2019s recent illness had rattled her, and Matt wanted to see a chiropractor for back pain that was threatening his ability to work.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t afford to both treat his back issues and pay for insurance,\u201d she said one morning. She was crying, and it was time to go to work.\n\nThe following week, after months of searching, Ms. Hurd got offered a full-time job with benefits, running social-media marketing for a company that sells plant nutrition products. The Hurds plan on dropping their Obamacare policy in April, when her new coverage, with a $300 monthly premium, should kick in. The deductible \u2014 $3,000 per person, up to $6,000 for the family \u2014 will still be higher than she\u2019d like, but she didn\u2019t complain. Her indignation seemed to be softening.\n\n\u201cI understand that some people cannot afford health care and shouldn\u2019t just be left to suffer,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there has to be a better way than asking a very small amount of people to foot that bill.\u201d", "keywords": ["gwen", "obamacare", "dicola", "health", "medicaid", "care", "trump", "dilemma", "ms", "hurd", "free", "work", "coverage", "squeezed"], "polarity": 0.08167645846217277, "subjectivity": 0.4214222153507866},

His white shirt and gray slacks were an accordion of wrinkles. His hair, flecked with gray, drooped on his forehead and small dark rings had formed under his eyes.\n\nBut he hadn\u2019t lost his voice. The Democratic congressman from El Paso was speaking to a crowd of several hundred at Suga\u2019s restaurant, 830 miles from home, trying to make an improbable case: that he can defeat Texas\u2019 incumbent Republican senator, Ted Cruz.\n\nDemocrats need to pick up two seats in the midterm elections to win control of the Senate, but they also must defend incumbents in 10 states that President Trump won. Mr. Cruz is seen as safer than, say, Dean Heller, Nevada\u2019s Republican senator, or the seats in Arizona and Tennessee that are being vacated by incumbents. And with Democratic money playing defense for incumbents in Missouri, Indiana, West Virginia and elsewhere, Mr. O\u2019Rourke expects no cavalry from Washington to come help him.\n\nBut Democrats will need wins wherever they can get them \u2014 so the long-shot is going it alone.\n\nImage The Brandon Community Center in Lufkin.\n\nImage Laura Bowman announced supporters of Mr. O'Rourke raised $1,200 for his campaign.\n\nImage Mr. O'Rourke arrived for a town hall event in Wharton, Texas.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke told the crowd at Suga\u2019s that the \u201cDreamers\u201d \u2014 young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children \u2014 should be protected. No wall should be built on the border with a friendly country. College must be more affordable. Women deserve access to reproductive health services. All Muslims should not be banned, and the press is not the enemy of the people.\n\nHe appealed to their sense of virtue. \u201cThis smallness, this bigotry, this paranoia, this anxiety,\u201d he said, cadence accelerating, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to be for the big, aspirational, ambitious things.\u201d\n\nHe appealed to their sense of humor. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason that Congress has an approval rating of around nine percent. Nine percent! Communism ten percent. Gonorrhea eight percent. We\u2019re right in the middle.\u201d\n\nAnd he appealed to their anger at Washington. The \u201csystem is rigged,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI can tell you that access is purchased, that votes are bought and paid for, that outcomes are determined before you have a chance to call your member of Congress or senator.\u201d\n\nThe crowd cheered, they hooted, they left saying things like \u201che was great\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\n\nImage A donation bin was passed around the room in Lufkin.\n\nBefore Beaumont, Mr. O\u2019Rourke spoke to town halls this month in Lufkin and Woodville, deeply conservative places where Democrats are rarely seen. \u201cIt takes guts to come to this area,\u201d one woman in Woodville said. The man who introduced him in Lufkin had just one request, that he refrain from swearing, an admonition that Mr. O\u2019Rourke heeded in Lufkin but not in Beaumont.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke is favored to win his party primary next month and challenge Mr. Cruz. But his odds in November are beyond long. No Democrat has won a statewide office in Texas since 1994, the year before Amazon sold its first book.\n\nBy the calculations of Mike Baselice, a Republican pollster in Austin, demographic changes might make Texas competitive in 2032, certainly not in 2018. Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s quest, he said, is \u201csame book, different chapter\u201d of other Democratic hopefuls. \u201cThis is not a level playing field here.\u201d\n\nIt has been so bleak for Democrats in Texas that they define victory in terms of the size of their losses. A running joke in Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s speeches is that he has almost convinced his mother, Melissa, a Republican, to vote for him.\n\nIf the hill weren\u2019t steep enough, Mr. O\u2019Rourke also has refused to hire outside consultants or pollsters, and he will only accept contributions from individuals. He has no interest in using big data. When he tells this to Democratic colleagues in the House, some have simply turned and walked away from him, unable to take him seriously.\n\nBut there is power in the giant-killer narrative and signs that his anti-campaign playbook campaign is working. He raised $2.4 million in the last quarter, and gets applause when he notes that was $500,000 more than Mr. Cruz took in.\n\nHe has a restless energy that has put him in 217 of Texas 254 counties, driving tens of thousands of miles, fueled by bad coffee and Hostess cupcakes that supporters bring him.\n\nImage Mr. O'Rourke's schedule for a day of campaigning.\n\nImage Mr. O'Rourke stopped at a gas station near Brenham, Tex.\n\nImage Chris Evans, Mr. O'Rourke's communications director, recorded a Facebook live video in the parking lot of their hotel in Beaumont, Tex.\n\nIn Lufkin, he was greeted with chants of \u201cBeto, Beto, Beto.\u201d His campaign took in $1,258 in checks and cash dropped into a large jar.\n\n\u201cI think he can win. I think he can inspire Texans,\u201d said Susan McCulley, adding, \u201cwe\u2019re not just mad, we\u2019re scared.\u201d\n\nAnother supporter, Ferryn Martin, said, \u201cIn 2010, the Tea Party was mad. This year, we are mad.\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke tries to tap into that emotion. He livestreams almost every aspect of his campaign \u2014 the coffees, the town halls, \u201cbowling with Beto,\u201d stops at Whataburger, the drives between stops, which often include calls to voters and activists and from his wife, Amy. Driving with his left forearm and right elbow on the steering wheel, he asked her about the science fair projects of their three children.\n\nHis theory of the case is that he can make the sale in rural Texas in part simply by showing up. If he can cut down Mr. Cruz\u2019s margins there and generate energy in urban precincts and suburbs, he can become the first Democrat since Lloyd Bentsen in 1988 to win a Texas Senate seat.\n\nDemocrats in Texas have long been saying that the demographic changes sweeping the state, fueled by a surge in the Latino population, would eventually make the state two-party competitive, but even some of the more optimistic forecasts don\u2019t have that happening until 2024. Still, there are other factors at work that add to their hopes. The number of college-educated residents in the state increased by 20 percent from 2006 to 2016, according to Lloyd Potter, the Texas state demographer. Rural areas are losing population while urban and suburban areas are gaining.\n\n\u201cIf one was able to figure out how to turn out the Latino vote and the African-American vote, that could change things pretty dramatically,\u201d Mr. Potter said. \u201cThe issue is how far-off in the horizon it is.\u201d\n\nImage Velenta Mathews-Hunter, a retired school teacher, shook hands with Mr. O'Rourke in Orange, Tex.\n\nImage A cardboard cut-out of John wayne in Robert\u2019s Restaurant and Meat Market in Orange.\n\nImage\n\nBut President Trump, who carried the state by nine percentage points, is complicating conventional analysis. \u201cAll things being equal, if there wasn\u2019t a Trump, it would be in the mid 2020s until the state would get competitive,\u201d said Russ Tidwell, a Democratic consultant who has worked in the state for decades. \u201cBut Trump makes other things possible.\u201d\n\nAnd Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign is all about a sense of the possible.\n\nHis biography does not have any of the bootstraps appeal of a Lyndon Johnson, or even Mr. Cruz, the son of immigrant parents. Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s family was well-to-do in El Paso. Born Robert Francis O\u2019Rourke, he has been known as \u201cBeto\u201d from infancy. His voice shows no hint of a Texas accent until his says his first name and sounds like he is speaking Spanish \u2014 which he does, fluently.\n\nHe was sent to Woodberry Forest boarding school in Virginia, then Columbia, where he was captain of the crew team. He played in a punk rock band, hauled expensive art and enjoyed the wanderlust that a young man from a wealthy family can afford. He went back to El Paso and started a technology company, then ran for City Council before winning his House seat in 2012, defeating an incumbent.\n\nIn the House, he has hardly left a footprint. He did not vote for Representative Nancy Pelosi to be the Democratic leader, and Mr. O\u2019Rourke, 45, thinks his party in Congress needs fresh leaders, which is one reason he supports term limits.\n\nImage Cynthia Cano, Mr. O'Rourke's campaign logistics and events director, with him for an event in Beaumont.\n\nMr. Cruz, who did not respond to a request to discuss the race, has never been as popular as Republicans like former governors George W. Bush or Rick Perry, but he has been tactically adroit and plays well to more conservative voters. He has an uneasy alliance with Mr. Trump that started with the president calling him \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d during the primaries and has evolved into invitations to the White House.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s is an emotive approach, Mr. Cruz\u2019s one of cold-eyed precision.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he is a flash in the pan,\u201d William Martin, a scholar at the Baker Institute at Rice University said of Mr. O\u2019Rourke. \u201cHe\u2019s young and fresh, and he\u2019s just intrinsically so much more attractive than Ted Cruz for voters who don\u2019t already have their minds made up.\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke knows Mr. Cruz is a skilled debater, a proven fund-raiser and a candidate who showed in his presidential campaign that he could leverage analytics into millions of votes. And the congressman has vulnerabilities. Mr. O\u2019Rourke has been arrested twice, once for a college prank, a second time, in 1998, for what he called the \u201cunforgivably\u201d bad decision to drive after \u201chaving too much to drink.\u201d Both charges were dismissed.\n\nHis mother receives fund-raising solicitations from Mr. Cruz, who calls her son a \u201cNancy Pelosi liberal,\u201d no doubt a preview of things to come.\n\nBut Mr. O\u2019Rourke also will use Mr. Cruz\u2019s well-observed ambition against him, and said that the incumbent\u2019s real goal is another White House run. He cites a letter that Mr. Cruz sent to Gov. Kim Reynolds, Republican of Iowa, talking about visiting all of Iowa\u2019s 99 counties.\n\n\u201cI know he hasn\u2019t been to all 254 of Texas\u2019 counties,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said.\n\nImage Mr. O'Rourke at Suga's restaurant in Beaumont.\n\nImage Mr. O'Rourke's campaign buttons are designed in the likeness of Robert F. Kennedy, his political hero.\n\nImage Mr. O'Rourke talked to his wife, Amy, in his hotel room in Bay City, Tex.\n\nTexas is so vast that it is nearly impossible to travel the entire state the way that Mr. O\u2019Rourke has chosen to, largely by car, over state highways and rural roads, but he seems undeterred and drives most of the miles himself, with aides in passenger seats.\n\nOver lunch at the Lufkin BBQ, Mr. O\u2019Rourke said his campaign strategy was in part drawn from the 1968 presidential campaign of his political hero, Robert F. Kennedy, long on hope and aspiration.\n\nMr. Kennedy was not driven by \u201cpolls or consultants, but he really seemed to be grounded in the things that he found important,\u201d he said, adding that he often seemed to be going directly against the advice of what was going to be popular.\n\nThose seemed to be the words of a long-shot, a candidate with nothing to lose.\n\nImage Mr. O'Rourke at an event in Woodville, Tex.\n\nOrder Reprints | Today\u2019s Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A 9 of the New York edition with the headline: A Blue Spark In the Heart Of Deep-Red Cruz Country\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up for the Morning Briefing Get what you need to know to start your day in the United States, Canada and the Americas, delivered to your inbox.

The suspect, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, had no criminal record. He bought at least seven guns legally, including an AK-47 he had purchased in the past month, a federal law enforcement official said on Monday.\n\nMr. Cruz, who has confessed to investigators, appeared on Monday in a Fort Lauderdale courtroom in shackles and a red jumpsuit as lawyers argued over whether a defense motion filed last week should be kept confidential. Mr. Cruz did not look up during the brief hearing.\n\nSeveral other Republicans have expressed a willingness since the shooting to discuss a change in gun laws, though they have given few specifics. On Monday, Gov. Rick Scott of Florida announced he would hold meetings with state and local leaders, focusing on ways to improve school safety, expand mental health care and keep guns out of the hands of people with mental illness.\n\nGov. John Kasich of Ohio said on Sunday that some \u201csmall steps\u201d should be taken on gun control, addressing background checks and mental illness. Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont said in a statement that his administration would review its procedures and policies on gun safety.\n\nNeither suggested that change was imminent. Their remarks recalled other murmurings of change that ultimately fizzled. Congress has been marked by intransigence on gun legislation, including a failure last year to ban so-called bump stocks, an accessory that the gunman in the October shooting in Las Vegas used to transform his semiautomatic rifles to mimic automatic weapon fire. That shooting left 58 people dead and wounded hundreds.\n\nStudents from Parkland and across the country have organized protests and marches to urge Mr. Trump and lawmakers to act. About 100 people gathered in front of the White House on Monday to rally for stricter gun control. Seventeen students, representing the number of people killed in Florida, lay on the ground in protest. Parents, teachers and friends joined them on the pavement, and high school students stood in clusters in 40-degree temperatures, chanting \u201cEnough is enough!\u201d and waving signs that read \u201cAm I next?\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

You are the president of the United States, and you have the audacity to put this on Russia as an excuse.\u201d\n\nThe legislation last fall was considered a modest step toward a bipartisan compromise on gun safety.\n\nThe lead senators behind the bill \u2014 Mr. Cornyn and Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut \u2014 have seen some of the worst mass shootings in United States history unfold in their states. A shooting that killed 20 first graders and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012 came near the start of Mr. Murphy\u2019s time in office, and gun restrictions became a defining issue for him. The shooting deaths of over two dozen people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., in November prompted Mr. Cornyn to be a co-sponsor of the bill.\n\nAfter the Texas shooting, Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked the F.B.I. to conduct an extensive review of the database because, as he said in a statement at the time, \u201crelevant information may not be getting reported.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet on Monday, Mr. Murphy said that the bill alone would do little to stop the what he called an \u201cepidemic\u201d of violence.\n\nThe president, who has spoken favorably about gun rights over the years, has held wavering views on gun restrictions. He had a concealed weapon permit in New York when Rudolph W. Giuliani was mayor, but it is not clear whether he maintained it.\n\nIn 2000, as he considered an earlier run for president, Mr. Trump wrote in his book \u201cThe America We Deserve\u201d that \u201cI generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I also support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWith today\u2019s internet technology we should be able to tell within 72 hours if a potential gun owner has a record.\u201d\n\nIn 2016 on CNN, Mr. Trump said guns should not be allowed in classrooms, and then followed up moments later by saying that some teachers should have access to firearms.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou look at some of our schools, unbelievable what\u2019s going on, but I\u2019m not advocating guns in the classroom,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the time. \u201cRemember in some cases, a lot of people admit this, trained teachers should be able to have guns in classrooms.\u201d", "keywords": ["changes", "background", "adds", "teachers", "support", "gun", "mr", "york", "students", "trump", "school", "guns", "buyers", "states", "shooting", "checks", "cautious"], "polarity": -0.009549309138350233, "subjectivity": 0.3835397023068255},

Justice Kennedy was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, a Republican. President Trump may be an unconventional Republican, but he is a Republican.\n\nJustices also try to retire early in a president\u2019s term, generally in the first two years, according to a 2010 study by Ross M. Stolzenberg, a demographer at the University of Chicago, and James T. Lindgren, a law professor at Northwestern. The study considered justices who served between 1789 and 2006.\n\n\u201cIf the incumbent president is of the same party as the president who nominated the justice to the court, and if the incumbent president is in the first two years of a four-year presidential term,\u201d the study found, \u201cthen the justice has odds of resignation that are about 2.6 times higher than when these two conditions are not met.\u201d\n\nJustices also take account of who controls the Senate and its internal rules.\n\n\u201cIf I resign any time this year,\u201d Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in the fall of 2014, less than two years into President Obama\u2019s second term, \u201che could not successfully appoint anyone I would like to see in the court.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo anybody who thinks that if I step down, Obama could appoint someone like me, they\u2019re misguided,\u201d she said.\n\nArtemus Ward, the author of \u201cDeciding to Leave: The Politics of Retirement From the United States Supreme Court,\u201d said Justice Kennedy found himself at a crucial crossroads. If he wants to resign under a Republican president in the first half of a presidential term, he must act.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now or never,\u201d said Mr. Ward, a political scientist at Northern Illinois University. \u201cIt\u2019s either this year or you wait until the next election.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nParty loyalty is likely to overcome more subtle concerns about judicial legacy, Mr. Ward said. Justice Kennedy holds the crucial vote in many closely divided cases, and he has been drifting to the left. He has cast conservative votes in cases on campaign finance and gun rights but has lately voted with the court\u2019s liberal wing on gay rights, abortion and affirmative action.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Kennedy, a Democrat. Even so, Justice White said, it was fitting to retire under a Democratic president because he had been appointed by one. He stepped down not long after President Bill Clinton was elected and was replaced by Justice Ginsburg, whose voting record has been considerably more liberal.\n\nA new study on departures from the Supreme Court attempted to refine the conventional factors by considering political science data on justices\u2019 voting patterns, involuntary departures and missed opportunities. It concluded that justices have not been particularly successful at ensuring that they would be replaced by like-minded successors.\n\nJustice Kennedy is in a ticklish spot, said the study\u2019s author, Christine Kexel Chabot, who teaches at Loyola University Chicago School of Law. He is, she wrote, a moderate conservative, and there is no reason to think a president of either party would replace him with someone similar.\n\nIn all likelihood, she wrote, Mr. Trump would appoint a committed conservative like his first nominee, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch. In the few divided cases in which Justices Kennedy and Gorsuch participated in the court\u2019s last term, they agreed just 38 percent of the time. By contrast, Justice Gorsuch agreed with Justice Clarence Thomas, the court\u2019s most conservative member, 100 percent of the time.\n\nMs. Chabot also explored justices\u2019 decisions to forgo opportunities to retire under like-minded presidents.\n\nOf the 16 justices since 1954 who reached the age 65 and had served on the court for at least 18 years, Ms. Chabot found, nine passed up politically opportune retirements, risking having to leave the court for health reasons in less attractive circumstances.\n\nTwo of them \u2014 Justices White and John Paul Stevens \u2014 retired later on. Justice Elena Kagan replaced Justice Stevens, and her voting record resembles his.\n\nAnother two, Justices Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, could have retired under President Obama but continue to serve.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStaying on is understandable, Ms. Chabot wrote. \u201cRetirement from the court is very costly for a justice,\u201d she wrote, \u201cas he or she must permanently give up what is often an immensely personally rewarding position as well as the most powerful judicial office in the United States.\u201d\n\nTry as they might, Mr. Ward said, justices have had only mixed success in deciding when to step down.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t completely time their retirements perfectly because they\u2019re just like us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know when they\u2019re going to get sick, and they don\u2019t know when they\u2019re going to die, and they don\u2019t know who is going to win the next election.\u201d\n\nAs for Justice Kennedy, Ms. Chabot noted in an interview that he has hired law clerks for the term that starts in October. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he remains on the bench,\u201d she said.", "keywords": ["anthony", "justices", "court", "ward", "mr", "chabot", "kennedy", "term", "president", "wrote", "retire", "justice", "influences", "decision"], "polarity": 0.11881962481962483, "subjectivity": 0.40213419913419907},

A few senior officials in the West Wing had access to details of the allegations of physical and emotional abuse made by Mr. Porter\u2019s ex-wives. A greater number of people had a sense that something was amiss, but chose to avert their gaze instead of asking questions.\n\nThe first hours after the issue was brought to light by an article in The Daily Mail were a confused blur, with officials like Mr. Kelly at first endorsing Mr. Porter\u2019s resignation, but then agreeing to issue statements in support of him. That disarray belied the belief of some in the White House that someone \u2014 Mr. Kelly \u2014 was finally in charge after six months of drama and infighting in 2017. In reality, these officials now concede, no one truly was.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t figured out how the place operates, and apparently they don\u2019t want to learn,\u201d said John Dean, a White House counsel under President Richard M. Nixon. The Porter situation, he added, \u201cis a manifestation of what happens when you have chaos.\u201d\n\nMr. Kelly, a four-star Marine general, had been billed as uniquely qualified to bring order to Mr. Trump\u2019s world when he took his post in July. Now he faces a morale crisis in the West Wing, where aides describe a sense of betrayal by a chief of staff they no longer trust after his claims that he had not fully known about Mr. Porter\u2019s problems and had acted within minutes once he learned of them.\n\nBut above all, White House veterans say, President Trump is responsible for the haphazard nature with which his operation has functioned, in part because he knew and cared little for the rules and norms that govern the executive branch. Unprepared to fill the ranks of a new administration, Mr. Trump never tried to set a tone of discipline or ethical rigor in his West Wing.\n\n\u201cA White House reflects the president,\u201d said William M. Daley, a chief of staff under Mr. Obama. \u201cSo he moves on to the next scandal, crisis, attack, whatever, and no self-reflection. So why should anyone be surprised that that sort of becomes the M.O., even when there\u2019s a belief that there\u2019s institutional stuff one should consider.\u201d\n\nFor 13 months, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides have approached their mercurial and process-averse boss by putting their heads down and ignoring what they could not control, avoiding information that could rattle their daily balance.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut in the case of Mr. Porter, White House aides privately acknowledge, some advisers appear to have chosen to try to protect a colleague who was generally well liked and, more important, too competent to lose. Mr. Trump himself often expressed his regard for Mr. Porter by describing him as \u201cout of central casting.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the hours after the allegations against Mr. Porter became public, some senior officials in fact hesitated to force him out, in part because they argued that if one top adviser could be felled by accusations, they could all potentially be vulnerable. Mr. Porter denied privately to his colleagues, as well as publicly, that he had ever physically abused his wives.\n\nWhat distinguished this crisis from the ones that preceded it was that it was not localized to one official, such as Stephen K. Bannon, the isolated chief strategist who left in August, or Reince Priebus, the often uninformed chief of staff who departed a month before that. Mr. Porter\u2019s case had spread to so many aspects of the White House that it ensnared a number of staff members.\n\nWhile multiple officials in the West Wing were aware that he had been unable to pass his background check, none appear to have made an effort to ascertain precisely why and take action on it. Several former White House counsels have said they would have made it their business to know if an official at Mr. Porter\u2019s level was facing allegations as serious as domestic abuse, but officials in the White House have privately maintained that Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, never did.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Bauer, a White House counsel under President Barack Obama.\n\nC. Boyden Gray, who served as White House counsel under President George Bush, said the problems might have been exacerbated by the existence of the special counsel investigation into Russian election meddling and potential Trump campaign ties to it.\n\nMr. McGahn and other senior officials may be reluctant to engage with the F.B.I. or the Justice Department on security clearances or any other matter, for fear of being drawn into the inquiry, he said. \u201cYou just didn\u2019t want to call the F.B.I. or call the D.O.J. on any subject, Russia or not,\u201d Mr. Gray said of officials in the West Wing. \u201cThat may have contributed to the breakdown here.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Mr. Trump has been in open war with the F.B.I. for months, a fact that some West Wing aides believe contributed to the debacle.\n\nThe dismissal on Wednesday of George David Banks, who was the White House point person on climate change, was seen as a particularly galling move after 13 months in which nobody in the West Wing had seemed particularly concerned about enforcing a standard for past conduct.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Banks had been told that he would not be granted a full security clearance. In an interview, he said the reason was that he had smoked marijuana a handful of times between 2010 and 2013, conduct that he said he had self-reported to the F.B.I. nearly a year ago.\n\n\u201cIt was unbelievable,\u201d Mr. Banks said of the decision to deny him a clearance, which he learned about abruptly at the end of a workday, when an official from Mr. McGahn\u2019s office and a human resources aide asked for a meeting later that evening. After informing him of their decision and allowing Mr. Banks to resign, they asked him to gather his things and escorted him from the premises.\n\nInside the West Wing, officials said, Mr. Banks is seen as collateral damage in a belated effort by Mr. Kelly and other top officials to show they are cracking down on interim security clearances.\n\nYet former White House advisers from both parties have been mystified at the ineptitude of Mr. Trump\u2019s team in dealing with the fallout from Mr. Porter\u2019s situation.\n\nPart of the problem, they argue, is a culture at the White House that does not appear to prioritize getting at the truth.\n\n\u201cThe fundamentals of Crisis Management 101 were certainly not observed here, but more importantly, there does not seem to be a priority on marshaling and disclosing the facts, whatever they may be,\u201d said Jack Quinn, who served as White House counsel under Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky affair. \u201cThey need to stop the bleeding, and I think that they\u2019ve got to understand that the bleeding is not going to stop until the full truth is told.\u201d", "keywords": ["officials", "scandal", "house", "mr", "white", "wing", "counsel", "trump", "president", "porters", "seeks", "learn", "abuse", "west"], "polarity": 0.06546208192247795, "subjectivity": 0.3426424785335676},

Credit Tom Brenner/The New York Times\n\nRob Goldman, vice president for ads at Facebook, posted an eight-part thread on Twitter late Friday about his company\u2019s role in Russian disinformation \u2014 and quickly caused a firestorm.\n\nIn his messages, Mr. Goldman discussed the indictment of 13 Russians and three companies accused of carrying out a scheme to subvert the 2016 election. Facebook was frequently mentioned in the indictment as the main tech tool that the Russians had used to tilt the election in favor of Donald J. Trump.\n\nMr. Goldman defended Facebook in his tweets, saying that the Russian-bought ads on the social network were not primarily aimed at swaying the vote result. His posts went viral on Saturday when President Trump cited them as proof that Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign was about something other than giving him an election victory.\n\nThe Fake News Media never fails. Hard to ignore this fact from the Vice President of Facebook Ads, Rob Goldman! https://t.co/XGC7ynZwYJ \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2018\n\nWe fact-checked Mr. Goldman\u2019s eight tweets. Here\u2019s what we found.\n\n\u201cWe shared Russian ads with Congress, Mueller and the American people to help the public understand how the Russians abused our system.\u201d Tweet #1\n\nPartly true.\n\nWhen the Russians\u2019 use of Facebook to influence the 2016 election became public last year, the company said it was sharing the Russian-bought ads with Congress and Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel leading the investigation.\n\nBut Facebook did not directly share the ads with the American people. Instead, the House Intelligence Committee released examples of the ads ahead of congressional hearings last November.\n\n\u201cI have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal.\u201d Tweet #2\n\nNot according to the indictment.\n\nThe grand jury indictment secured by Mr. Mueller asserts that the goal of Russian operatives was to influence the 2016 election, particularly by criticizing Hillary Clinton and supporting Mr. Trump and Bernie Sanders, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s chief rival for the Democratic nomination.\n\nThe Russians \u201cengaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump,\u201d the indictment said.\n\nMr. Goldman later wrote in another tweet that \u201cthe Russian campaign was certainly in favor of Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe majority of the Russian ad spend happened AFTER the election.\u201d Tweet #3\n\nTrue, but here is some context.\n\nAccording to figures published by Facebook last October, 44 percent of the Russian-bought ads were displayed before the 2016 election, while 56 percent were shown afterward. Mr. Goldman asserted that those figures were not published by the \u201cmainstream media\u201d \u2014 however, many mainstream news outlets did print those numbers, including CNN, Reuters and The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cThe main goal of the Russian propaganda and misinformation effort is to divide America by using our institutions, like free speech and social media, against us.\u201d Tweet #4\n\nNot exactly.\n\nThe indictment does show that Russian operatives used social media \u2014 particularly Facebook \u2014 to try to sow division among Americans. But to reiterate, the indictment said that the Russians\u2019 goal was to sway the 2016 election toward a particular outcome. That aim was pursued not just through ads, which Mr. Goldman focuses on, but through Facebook pages, groups and events.\n\n\u201cThe single best demonstration of Russia\u2019s true motives is the Houston anti-islamic protest. Americans were literally puppeted into the streets by trolls who organized both the sides of protest.\u201d Tweet #5\n\nThis needs context.\n\nThe protests in Houston in May 2016 were among many rallies organized by Russian operatives through Facebook. While the Houston protest was anti-Islamic, as Mr. Goldman said, he failed to note that the goal in promoting the demonstration was to link Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign with a pro-Islamic message.\n\nAccording to the indictment secured by Mr. Mueller, there were many other examples of Russian operatives using Facebook and Instagram to organize pro-Trump rallies. At one protest, the Russian operatives paid for a cage to be built, in which an actress dressed as Mrs. Clinton posed in a prison uniform.\n\n\u201cThe Russian campaign is ongoing. Just last week saw news that Russian spies attempted to sell a fake video of Trump with a hooker to the NSA.\u201d Tweet #6\n\nTrue.\n\nAmerican intelligence officials have said that Russia has continued to target the American public and that it is already meddling in the 2018 midterm elections. The New York Times also reported this month on an attempt by a shadowy Russian figure to sell stolen American cyberweapons, as well as compromising material on President Trump, to the United States.\n\n\u201cThere are easy ways to fight this. Disinformation is ineffective against a well educated citizenry. Finland, Sweden and Holland have all taught digital literacy and critical thinking about misinformation to great effect.\u201d Tweet #7\n\nNot exactly.\n\nWhile Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands have all made efforts to teach digital literacy, those countries are still grappling with how to handle misinformation. A recent survey in Finland found that 67 percent of respondents \u201cthink fake news affects Finns\u2019 perceptions on issues \u2018a lot\u2019 or to an \u2018extreme\u2019 degree.\u201d Officials in Sweden and the Netherlands have also recently warned that fake news poses a threat to their governments.\n\n\u201cWe are also taking aggressive steps to prevent this sort of meddling in the future by requiring verification of political advertisers and by making all ads on the platform visible to anyone who cares to examine them.\u201d Tweet #8\n\nTrue.\n\nAfter initially dismissing concerns that it influenced the 2016 election, Facebook has announced a series of moves to prevent its future misuse. One of those steps includes verifying political advertisers through a system that combines automated and human fact checkers. The company has also said it plans to use postcards sent by regular mail to verify the identities of American political advertisers. Whether these new measures will be effective is unclear.\n\nCorrection : Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the month when protests organized by Russian operatives were held in Houston.

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/18/us/politics/trump-election-russia.html", "text": "The dispute is especially raw because of the razor-thin margin in the election and the uncertainty over what exactly tipped the balance. Mrs. Clinton, who handily won the national popular vote, lost the Electoral College vote and therefore the presidency because Mr. Trump defeated her by less than a combined 80,000 votes in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nFew Democrats believe that Mr. Trump won solely as a result of Russia\u2019s intervention. But many think the meddling exacerbated Mrs. Clinton\u2019s challenges, making her more vulnerable to what some believe was the decisive blow: the announcement by James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director at the time, just over a week before the election that he was reopening the investigation into her use of a private email server.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cRussia succeeded in weakening her enough so that the Comey letter could knock her off,\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, who was Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign communications director.\n\nBut veterans of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign shake their head at what they believe is an abiding sense of denial among Clinton loyalists over her deficiencies.\n\n\u201cThe election was still won because Donald Trump was a better candidate with a superior message taking on a horrible candidate who people thought was corrupt,\u201d said David Bossie, a senior Trump strategist who is now president of the conservative lobbying group Citizens United. He allowed that Moscow had mounted a \u201cmalicious, disruptive campaign.\u201d\n\nNo single factor was determinative in an election that brought nearly 140 million Americans to the polls. And the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies say they do not have any way to calculate whether the Russian effort swung the election.\n\n\u201cTo credit the victory to anyone else including those 13 Russians is to demean everyday Americans\u2019 power to control their own destiny,\u201d said Stephen K. Bannon, the Trump campaign chief executive, who reportedly spent 20 hours with the team led by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in the Russia investigation, last week. \u201cThe \u2018deplorables\u2019 deserve better.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet it is difficult for Republicans to contend that the multimillion-dollar Russian intervention had no impact, with 126 million Americans being exposed to Russian-sponsored posts on Facebook alone.\n\nThe interference was not limited to the actions laid out by Mr. Mueller in the indictment of the 13 Russians linked to a \u201ctroll farm\u201d known as the Internet Research Agency.\n\nAccording to the intelligence community, the Russian government supported the email hacking of the Democratic National Committee and the personal account of John D. Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, as well as the disclosure of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s paid speeches. The committee emails, leaked just before the Democratic National Convention, helped increase the rancor between supporters of Mrs. Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nAnd the Podesta emails, leaked slowly over the month of October, were doled out selectively, with a number of exchanges held back, according to two Clinton campaign officials. While there were plenty of anodyne messages in the trove, the hackers made sure to reveal the messages that maximized the appearance of D.N.C. behavior unfairly favoring Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nFurther, a major factor in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s loss of the three crucial Rust Belt states, which every Democratic nominee had carried since 1992, was a drop-off in turnout and the performance of third-party candidates.\n\nShe could not match former President Barack Obama\u2019s turnout among blacks in cities like Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee, and the Green Party nominee, Jill Stein, captured enough votes to make up the difference between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It says that they funded social media posts that were explicitly aimed at encouraging \u201cU.S. minority groups not to vote in the 2016 U.S. presidential election or to vote for a third-party U.S. presidential candidate.\u201d\n\nFor example, the Russians created an Instagram account, \u201cWoke Blacks,\u201d and posted messages urging African-Americans not to vote at all rather than support \u201cthe lesser of two devils.\u201d They also purchased an ad on Instagram to promote a post that read: \u201cChoose peace and vote for Jill Stein. Trust me, it\u2019s not a wasted vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Stein vote alone clearly diminished Clinton\u2019s vote and some of the vote that might have gone to us in Milwaukee and stayed home was probably discouraged, and this Russia stuff played a role in that discouragement,\u201d said Paul Maslin, a Democratic pollster based in Wisconsin. \u201cOut of the 10 factors that most caused Trump to win, maybe this was only the seventh, but the fact that this is even on a relatively short list ought to be alarming.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, Republicans and even some Democrats note that the Russian meddling may not have mattered at all if Mrs. Clinton had run a better campaign. She ventured twice to Ohio in the final days of the campaign \u2014 a state she would lose by eight points \u2014 but never set foot in Wisconsin during the general election, and she made a few strategic errors in Michigan.\n\nDespite pleas from Michigan officials, her national campaign did not ask Mr. Obama to visit the state until the last day of the campaign \u2014 and it was forced to dispatch him to Ann Arbor to rally college students rather than sending him to Detroit, because a police funeral was scheduled in the city.\n\nAnd when Mrs. Clinton visited Michigan in the last days of the election, she spent some of her time in the deeply conservative and religious western part of the state trying to win over Republicans who were thought to be uneasy with Mr. Trump on moral grounds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d said Representative Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who pleaded with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign to devote more attention to the state. \u201cThe Russians clearly did things that made their way into Michigan. At the same time, as Democrats, if we\u2019re not talking about issues that matter to people, then we\u2019re not connecting with our base either.\u201d\n\nStu Sandler, a Michigan Republican strategist, was blunter: \u201cClinton didn\u2019t do enough in inner-city Detroit, and that was noticed by a lot of Democrats here.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton did spend considerable time in Pennsylvania, but she suffered there from what plagued her in the other parts of the industrial Midwest: Too many black voters stayed home, a slice of white liberals voted third-party, and many of the working-class whites who had backed Mr. Obama swung to Mr. Trump.\n\nHer environmental and gun-control policies turned off some of the state\u2019s ancestral Democrats, and the views she and her husband held in the 1990s on criminal justice depressed black turnout.\n\n\u201cShe was very unpopular here, so she didn\u2019t motivate the Democrats,\u201d said Rob Gleason, who was the state Republican chairman in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo Democrats, though, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s shortcomings were precisely what Russia preyed on to undercut her campaign.\n\n\u201cWe will never be able to know for certain if the massive Russian operation was the difference between victory and defeat,\u201d said Representative Brendan F. Boyle of Pennsylvania. \u201cBut there is one thing we absolutely can say with certainty: It was a factor. The Russians wouldn\u2019t have devoted hundreds of people and tens of millions of dollars on this operation if it wasn\u2019t having an effect.\u201d\n\nEven as Mr. Trump polarizes the country, both his admirers and detractors found themselves in agreement with one of his many Twitter observations on Sunday: that the Russians intended to sow chaos, and \u201chave succeeded beyond their wildest dreams.\u201d", "keywords": ["election", "clintons", "clinton", "russia", "mr", "vote", "difference", "doubt", "trump", "campaign", "mrs", "leaves", "russians", "michigan", "indictment", "backed"], "polarity": 0.06753924267222139, "subjectivity": 0.4347604818349497},

Oliver Whitney, the screenwriter Joe Robert Cole, one of the writers for \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d says he vaguely recalls some discussion of whether to include the lesbian love story. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t some major theme through that we were looking to explore with [those characters] in terms of the story,\u201d Cole clarifies. \u201cWe didn\u2019t like, pull out a full thread of some theme.\u201d\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t Play With Our Emotions: \u201cBlack Panther\u201d and Queer Representation\u2019 [The Root]\n\nBriana Lawrence, who identifies as a queer black woman, was surprised that the scene\u2019s exclusion didn\u2019t bother her. \u201cI should\u2019ve been cursing Ryan Coogler out, swift and fast like my mama taught me when someone pisses me off,\u201d she writes. \u201cBut after thinking it over, I\u2019m happy the scene didn\u2019t make it into the movie, and that feels blasphemous to admit as someone who is always championing representation \u2014 especially for queer folks of color like me.\u201d\n\nHeartwarming Bonus Read: \u2018I Took 7th Graders to See \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d Here\u2019s What They Said.\u2019 [The New York Times]\n\nProf. Kevin Noble Maillard watched the film with a handful of tweens from a Brooklyn public school.

A graduate of Nascar\u2019s Drive for Diversity program, Darrell Wallace Jr., 24, could give stock car racing something it has never had before: an African-American star.\n\nBut that is not why Richard Petty brought Wallace onto his team.

It was enough for Petty, one of Nascar\u2019s most iconic names, to not only give Wallace a full-time ride, but also to give him his famed No. 43 racecar to drive. Wallace is the first African-American to drive full-time in the top Nascar series since Wendell Scott in 1971.\n\nPetty insisted, though, that he is colorblind when it comes to evaluating talent.

But there\u2019s also venturing out into a different market, into different avenues where the African-American culture lives. We all have to do better at that.\u201d\n\nThere are challenges, of course. On social media, where vulgar epithets can be spewed from faceless and fictitious monikers, Wallace has, at times, had to think twice before responding. He admits he has not always been successful.\n\n\u201cThere is always going to be haters out there, people who don\u2019t want to see you succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that since Day 1 from my parents. Just keep your head down and keep moving, that\u2019s the best you can do.\u201d\n\nBlaney, his closest friend on the circuit, has been around Wallace when offensive remarks have been made.\n\n\u201cThankfully, it\u2019s very, very rare, but it upsets me,\u201d Blaney said. \u201cBubba\u2019s great at handling it. He\u2019s an amazing ambassador for the sport. And he\u2019s really talented and a heck of a competitor. All of us are competitive, but his competitiveness is unlike anyone I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nNascar\u2019s diversity has become an issue again after its only female racer, Danica Patrick, announced she will retire from the circuit after the Daytona 500. But Wallace is not the only driver who can energize an overlooked community. What he can do for an African-American audience, Su\u00e1rez can do for the Latino market. A native of Monterrey, Mexico, Su\u00e1rez said he had noticed an uptick in social media messages from a variety of Latino countries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually either people who tell me they\u2019re now following the sport because of me, or they\u2019ve been fans and now they have a driver to root for,\u201d said Su\u00e1rez, who is also a graduate of the Drive for Diversity program. \u201cThe potential is huge. This is the most diverse country in the world, but we have to improve diversity in Nascar. If we can make the sport more diverse, we\u2019ll see the same thing with fans. More diversity on the racetrack will mean more diversity in the stands.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Nascar waits, wondering who will emerge as its next star.", "keywords": ["sport", "leader", "emerge", "drive", "hes", "generation", "waits", "petty", "diversity", "racing", "wallace", "su\u00e1rez", "africanamerican", "nascar"], "polarity": 0.13599389129389128, "subjectivity": 0.4590651755651755},

Townships have gotten electricity and more modern housing. Government contracts have been set aside for black would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nThese programs have had an impact, improving material conditions and generating jobs.\n\nThey have also been riddled with corruption.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt local governments across South Africa, bureaucrats have abused their authority to steer contracts to companies that put cash in their pockets. At every level of society, people have grown accustomed to kickbacks and political connections determining who prospers, and who goes without.\n\nMr. Zuma\u2019s demise resonates as a sign of a potential new order taking shape. He will forever be linked to his association with the Guptas, three Indian-born brothers who effectively bought key levers of governmental power, amassing influence so comprehensive that it became known as \u201cstate capture.\u201d\n\nHis resignation has raised hopes that South Africa is finally contending with its epidemic of corruption. That view gained momentum when an elite police unit raided a home belonging to the Guptas nearly at the same moment that Mr. Ramaphosa was assuming office.\n\nThe new president is a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle, a former deputy president and chairman of the National Planning Commission, a focal point for thinking about how to engineer economic growth. As a former trade union leader and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Mandela, he enjoys credibility among a range of interest groups, while carrying a reputation as a savvy and strategic operator.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe has had his brushes with controversy, most notably after a 2012 police massacre of striking platinum miners that killed 34 people. At the time, Mr. Ramaphosa occupied a seat on the board of Lonmin, the company that owned the mine. Emails soon surfaced showing that, a day before the police opened fire, Mr. Ramaphosa had been urging senior government officials to take strong action to end the strike.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, no corruption charges have stuck to the new president, who now claims a mandate to clean up the toxic mess left behind by Mr. Zuma.\n\nSome doubt whether the A.N.C. can be salvaged as an effective vehicle for egalitarian policymaking. The party\u2019s executive ranks include many figures implicated in corruption. Mr. Ramaphosa, 65, may champion new initiatives aimed at generating economic growth, yet he finds himself relying on his party brethren to execute his visions, with no certainty that the money will land where intended.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think that taking the president out does much to dismantle the patronage network,\u201d said Ayabonga Cawe, a development economist at Xesibe Holdings, a research and advisory firm in Johannesburg. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need a lot more than taking out the guy at the top.\u201d\n\nAbove all, Mr. Ramaphosa must contend with the structural defects that have long constrained South Africa\u2019s economy, a legacy of apartheid.\n\nBeyond its systemic discrimination against black people, apartheid severed the country from much of the global economy. It ensured that huge numbers of uneducated black South Africans were available at poverty-level wages within major sectors of the economy like mining, agriculture and textiles. That cushioned domestic companies from the pressure to modernize.\n\nPhoto\n\nInternational sanctions isolated South Africa, shielding its firms from competition against multinational rivals. Sanctions also denied South African companies the ability to operate abroad, giving them an incentive to focus on the domestic market. The apartheid-era government obliged with subsidies for favored firms while allowing companies to pursue oligopoly, free of nuisances like antitrust law.\n\nThe result was a system in which large industries, from retail to furniture-making to chemicals, were dominated by huge enterprises whose core strength was the ability to protect themselves against competition. That system has largely prevailed, with smaller companies and start-ups facing often-impossible odds.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cApartheid was a system that lends itself to large conglomerates and concentrations of wealth in the hands of a few,\u201d Mr. Cawe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the corruption. It\u2019s about all of these parallel networks in big business that you need to dismantle. Most of those are white.\u201d\n\nHere is a world that Mr. Ramaphosa knows keenly, having achieved extraordinary affluence by running South African companies with interests in mining, banking, real estate and telecommunications. His fortune has been estimated at $450 million.\n\nIf he is serious about reinvigorating the economy and creating a space for black-owned small businesses, he will need to take on the prevailing structure that made him so wealthy.\n\nHis success on that front may be even more decisive than whether he can tame corruption.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly the most optimistic moment for South Africa in a very long time,\u201d said Mr. Goldin, the former adviser to Mr. Mandela. \u201cIn a way, it does feel like a new beginning.

The aggressive pace of deportations of immigrants of color, the elimination of the DACA program protecting immigrant children and the proposals propounded by the anti-immigration voices in the administration will all have the undeniable effect of slowing the rapid racial diversification of the United States population. Despite this sweeping attempt at racial social engineering, few voices in progressive and Democratic circles are responding with the kinds of outrage that one would expect.\n\nThe pro-white preferences of Donald Trump and his administration, especially when it comes to immigration, are legion. From the day he opened his presidential campaign in 2015 by demonizing Mexicans to the enthusiasm generated by the calls for building a wall along the Mexican border to aggressively ramping up deportations of immigrants of color to eliminating DACA to vulgarly denigrating African nations and Haiti, this administration has been quite clear about its preference for white people.\n\nIt should be no surprise, then, that the immigration policies championed by the White House would all have the effect of reducing the number of people of color coming into the country. A recent study by The Washington Post found that the administration\u2019s proposals to curtail legal immigration by limiting family reunification would slightly delay the date when whites become a minority. \u201cBy greatly slashing the number of Hispanic and black African immigrants entering America, this proposal would reshape the future United States,\u201d the economist Michael Clemens said.\n\n\u201cDecades ahead,\u201d he added, \u201cmany fewer of us would be nonwhite or have nonwhite people in our families.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe administration\u2019s focus is not random.

People of color used to make up 12 percent of the United States population in 1965, and that percentage has more than tripled over the past several decades to the point where nonwhite people are nearly 39 percent of the residents of the United States (it is no accident that the country\u2019s first African-American president was elected when he was elected).

The very first immigration law passed, the Naturalization Act of 1790, declared that to become a citizen, one had to be a \u201cfree white person.\u201d That demarcation was the explicit law of the land for the next 162 years, until 1952. There are 20th-century Supreme Court cases explicitly holding that Asian immigrants could not become United States citizens because they were not white. Even after 1952, the practical effect of immigration policy continued to promote white people above others through mechanisms such as the Asia Pacific Triangle, which restricted immigration from Asian countries.", "keywords": ["immigration", "color", "white", "trump", "wants", "states", "america", "immigrants", "effect", "sign", "united", "nonwhite", "population"], "polarity": 0.07678771845438513, "subjectivity": 0.2882194965528299},

Almost all of those who led the campaign to bring him to account were black, like Thuli Madonsela, the former public protector, who played a heroic role in exposing Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption. South Africa\u2019s judiciary, which is majority black, defended the independence of the courts with extraordinary courage and under great pressure. After this display of black courage, why would it matter what white people think?\n\nBut South Africa is too fraught and complex a place for such a simple story to ring true. More plausible is that each pinprick penetrating Mr. Zuma\u2019s skin is felt by black South Africans, even those who are horrified by what he has done.\n\nBeneath the surface of public life, one can detect a strange, subliminal to-and-fro. Last year, for instance, a superb book describing in meticulous detail the deep corruption of the late apartheid years, \u201cApartheid Guns and Money,\u201d by Hennie van Vuuren, was a runaway best seller. It deserved to be widely read, but the scale of its success is partly a function of its utility as a weapon against white arrogance. \u201cHowever bad Zuma is,\u201d its many black readers could say to themselves, \u201cyou people were worse.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nTo shrug and say that we are all equally capable of stealing public money is to miss what is distinctive about the mess Mr. Zuma has made. For the truth is that Mr. Zuma and his allies were corrupt partly because they felt a sense of grievance intimately connected to their experience of race.\n\nWhen Mr. Zuma became president of South Africa in 2009, he rallied behind him an alliance of people who felt themselves to be marginal and neglected, not just in relation to the world economic order or white South Africa but also in relation to the A.N.C. itself. The A.N.C. has been run by people drawn from the ranks of an urbane, cosmopolitan elite.\n\nMr. Zuma represented a dramatic change in this tradition. Although he spent years in exile and climbed the ranks of the A.N.C., his biography was unlike any of his predecessors\u2019. Nelson Mandela was born into royalty. Thabo Mbeki was the son of prominent intellectuals. Mr. Zuma\u2019s mother worked in the kitchen of a white family and was too poor to provide her son with a formal education. He grew up herding cattle in the hinterland.\n\nWhen he came to power in 2009, he did so with the support of organizations representing much of the urban working class \u2014 the country\u2019s largest trade union and the South African Communist Party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut he soon dropped these organizations and turned for support to rural South Africa, in particular to traditional leaders and to the elites of far-flung provincial capitals. They carried with them into power an abiding sense of powerlessness, a feeling that the very institutions they now controlled were alien and belonged to others. In office, they believed that they had entered into their enemy\u2019s mansion. It seemed to be payback time.\n\nIn a speech delivered to a room of black businesspeople in December 2016, Mr. Zuma warned of the sophisticated ways in which the enemy confuses black people. One source of such confusion was the prevailing economic orthodoxy. Mr. Zuma suggested that the most fundamental of economic laws was merely nominal; remove the scales from our eyes and we see that so-called economic laws are a ruse invented by the powerful.\n\nHis genre of criminality is light-years from the sort that characterized the apartheid state. The corruption of apartheid\u2019s leaders stemmed from arrogance; they believed that they could control the world forever. Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption stems from the grievances of a man who feels very small.\n\nThis sense of grievance was on display in the last words he uttered publicly as president. In a swipe at his successor, Mr. Ramaphosa, Mr. Zuma suggested that those in the party who had unseated him were \u201cserving the interests of the oppressors of yesteryear, who joyfully celebrate as we lynch one another.\u201d\n\nBlack nationalism in South Africa has many faces. Mr. Ramaphosa represents a strand that is bourgeois, worldly and comfortable with power. There is also a militant, socialist strand of black nationalism, but it is on the wane. And there is the strand represented by Mr. Zuma, who governed as a man shaped and distorted by the violence and oppression of white supremacy.\n\nI am of course alive to the irony of a white South African like me saying that a black president\u2019s corruption was motivated by racial grievance. Many South Africans, black and white, would regard this argument as an excuse for the intolerable. But we should be honest enough to accept that even now, notwithstanding that apartheid has been gone since before nearly half the South African population was born, the legacy of white supremacy has lived on in the man who was president.", "keywords": ["whats", "black", "corruption", "jacob", "zumas", "economic", "mr", "white", "south", "distinctive", "africa", "apartheid", "zuma", "mess"], "polarity": 0.0616115067727971, "subjectivity": 0.37158776707163793},

Evenly lit, crisply photographed, they look like pictures from an illustrated medical dictionary, indexical images of heads, torsos and mouths that are detached from context. Even in a work like \u201cFigure\u201d (1991), the figure in question, sheathed in a black dress and set in the black infinity of no particular place, feels like a fragment, as though she had been extracted from a group photo or a furnished room. The texts accompanying her, eight engraved plastic plaques, read like excerpts from a language primer: \u201cfigured the worst,\u201d \u201che was disfigured,\u201d \u201cfigured there would be no reaction\u201d and so on. Here, not only has the story been winnowed down; it is in fact completely gone. There\u2019s no story. We are left with only the tensions of concrete poetry.\n\nSometime in the mid-1990s, Simpson began to detect clich\u00e9d responses to her work. At the same time, her own thinking was evolving. What does an image of a black woman mean? A commentary on race? An assertion about gender? Simpson branched out from figure-based images and began to experiment more with varied subject matter \u2014 landscapes and inanimate objects like wigs \u2014 and also with unusual quasi-sculptural material like felt and standing screens. A series of monumental multisectional images, several of them landscapes, collectively titled \u201cPublic Sex\u201d (1995-1998) and featuring no figures at all, addressed the provocative title only obliquely. These pictures, made over many years, contain what the scholar and curator Okwui Enwezor calls \u201cthe rumor of the body.\u201d Mysteries of a jagged and deadpan sort, they would go on to influence the noirish tone of Simpson\u2019s later film work.\n\nPhoto\n\nSimpson began to set ever more intricate conceptual layers between her initial inspiration for a work and the finished product. The idea for \u201c9 Props\u201d (1995) began during a residency at the Pilchuck Glass School in Washington. With the aid of artisans at the school, she fabricated a series of dark vessels modeled on vases and other objects used in the portrait work of the pioneering Harlem photographer James Van Der Zee. But these vessels were not the final work. She shipped them back to New York and then photographed them against a plain background. And that still was not the work. Further intervention followed: She turned those photographic images into nine lithographs, which she printed on felt. Finally, she wrote captions below each lithographed vessel, describing the context in which it originally appeared. One of them, for instance, reads:\n\nDinner Party with boxer Harry Wills, 1926 James VanDerZee Harry Wills a k a \u201cThe Black Panther,\u201d boxer, businessman- sits with seven other men and women, mostly women with champagne glasses raised as a woman on his left makes a toast in his honor. There are three bottles of champagne, a crystal decanter, a bottle of port, an arrangement of flowers and fruit, and before each guest an untouched china place setting.\n\nPhoto\n\nFrom multiple directions, the work gestures at what cannot be seen: the original placement of the vessels that inspired Simpson\u2019s own, the people in the photographs by James Van Der Zee, the social life of Harlem evoked by his photographs and the complexity of manners and class implied by them. All that vanished world of culture and experience is reduced to an elegant grid, as simple as an antiquarian\u2019s catalog, a thought picture that demands calm engagement and imaginative intervention on the viewer\u2019s part. Without being representational, it is about race; but race is not off in some category by itself, hemmed in only by questions of skin color, separate from life.\n\n\u201cRepresent!\u201d in the black American sense means standing up for your people, expressing solidarity and letting a shared ethos underwrite your presence and work. It is an exhortation, a greeting and a farewell. The word also has more conventional associations. In the visual arts, it is contrasted with the abstract or the symbolic. To represent, in this more common sense, is to make work that visually corresponds to realities out there in the world: to illustrate uncomplicatedly. This second sense of \u201crepresent\u201d is enjoying a vogue in the art world. Realism is back. This is welcome: after so long an absence of black figures and black faces in art museums, they are now being seen more frequently. Many artists, black and otherwise, are depicting the black body. It is necessary and often successful. Just as often, it fails when it is little more than a clumsy shorthand for socially concerned art, unobjectionable and unimpressive.\n\nA strong appeal of Simpson\u2019s work is that she has always embraced the inherent complexity of blackness, her own blackness as well as the blackness that runs ineluctably through American history. She does not reject representational depictions, but neither does she feel the need to confine herself only to \u201crace\u201d work. When an artist uses a black model, she is presenting a human question by foregrounding a human presence. Is a white man a person while a black woman is and can only be a gendered and racialized subject? As the scholar Kellie Jones has pointed out, nonwhite bodies are often thought of as \u201cnot neutral enough for the dispassionate formulas thought to constitute conceptual practice.\u201d If a black woman\u2019s race and gender are the only things apparent to certain viewers, Simpson seems to say, the ethical responsibility to escape those shackles is the viewer\u2019s.\n\nFreedom is Lorna Simpson\u2019s starting point and her permanent theme. A humane current animates all of her work, a current that neither sidesteps nor confines itself to race. Her work is simultaneously about the \u201cneutral\u201d space of ideas and the particularized experience of the body. \u201cMontage\u201d is photographic and painterly, a riff on a pair of found photographs, sequenced to look like a giant strip of film.

To some extent, there\u2019s always been an adversarial role between the White House and reporters. How do you feel about the tenor of things now? It used to be friendly-adversarial. There would be retaliation for stories they didn\u2019t like, but nothing compared with this. There\u2019s a war going on. For a president to come out with the term \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 he\u2019s putting targets on our heads. He has moved the goal posts when it comes to how politicians and people deal with the press.\n\nWhat\u2019s the value of the White House press briefing? Transparency. There is a veil on the White House; people want to look behind the curtain. It\u2019s their house. When you open up a press briefing to see the back and forth, you\u2019re getting more in the weeds of what\u2019s going on, beyond just the quote we may put in the story. This is a key piece that I don\u2019t think people really get: When you talk about the press, it\u2019s not about journalists; it\u2019s about the free-flowing information that the American public is supposed to get. When you bash the press, you\u2019re bashing the idea of getting truth out.\n\nWhat\u2019s the public opinion of the White House press corps? It depends on whom you talk to. We\u2019re so tribal now. There used to be a day when you didn\u2019t know the person\u2019s politics. The line has been obscured between facts and opinion. I think it started during the Clinton years, and it just kept getting progressively worse. People don\u2019t want to just hear the news; they want to hear what people have to say about it too.\n\nYour reactions during the televised briefings have generated memes. Has it made you more self-conscious? I\u2019m so sad about that. My boss has always said, \u201cYou need to know how to play poker.\u201d I don\u2019t. I\u2019m trying! The last time I was really caught off guard was when Sarah Huckabee Sanders said something about people\u2019s minds being in the gutter after President Trump\u2019s tweet about Kirsten Gillibrand. I really get into those briefings. I really try to listen. I don\u2019t play to the camera. I go in there, and I\u2019m really earnest. So when she said that, I was shocked! I was like, No, God, that was a little bit much.\n\nGiven how much you tangle with this particular administration, why do you think you get called on so much? Have you felt like a target? Yes, I have. But I have to shake that off, because I have to go in and do my job. I cover the White House. I cover all issues, particularly those that affect black and brown Americans. Now, what if they didn\u2019t call on me? A certain segment of America would not get the answers to some of their pressing questions. If I don\u2019t ask, who will?\n\nRyan is the White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks and a political analyst for CNN.

You had to ask whether this president believed slavery was wrong. I recently asked him, \u201cAre you a racist?\u201d It\u2019s a sad day when you have to ask a sitting president that. There has been a series of comments or lack of action, from calling Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas\u201d to how he dealt with Charlottesville to his comments on Norway versus Haiti, Africa, El Salvador, black and brown nations. It\u2019s not been one thing. It\u2019s been a pattern. So I asked. He did not answer, which I thought was a wasted moment. He could have put it to rest right then and there and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a racist.\u201d But it took him days to say that.\n\nYou said it seems as if it has changed, going forward, how the White House deals with the press corps and wields its power. What do you think this means for the next president you cover? He\u2019ll clamp down harder on us. Each president has pushed us further away from access. Who knows what will happen or what another president may want? They may not want to be followed. President Obama didn\u2019t like being followed, for example. This president hates us. He\u2019s warring on us.

Just like our kid who\u2019s not white dresses up like Captain America. I think the beautiful thing about comics is they do transcend race in a lot of ways.\u201d\n\nMary Dimacali, 29, a social media and marketing manager in Rockland County, New York, echoed that idea. She does not believe that her fianc\u00e9\u2019s 7-year-old son, Sawyer, who is white, sees the film or its characters through the lens of race. Sawyer himself, during the interview with Ms. Dimacali, said, \u201csure,\u201d when she asked if he\u2019d like to dress up as Black Panther.\n\n\u201cFor a white kid to be so open and judge based on the character\u2019s story and the personality and history, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s important,\u201d she said. \u201cBut on the flip side, I think it\u2019s also great to have a black superhero you can identify and connect to.\u201d\n\nThe character\u2019s history is unique. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1966, Black Panther rules as the king of an African technological utopia known as Wakanda. Untouched by European invaders, Wakanda exists apart from the legacies of colonization and racism. Black history and black fantasy are central to the character, and the series has brought on prominent black writers including Ta-Nehisi Coates to deepen its significance over the last 50 years.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

He is completing \u201cRise of the Black Panther,\u201d a six-part comic series for Marvel that traces the character\u2019s early history. He has tried to explain some of that history to his 7-year-old daughter, but without delving too deeply into complex concepts like Western imperialism, which she may struggle to grasp.\n\n\u201cYou want that white kid to be able to think that he can dress up in a Black Panther costume, because, to that kid, there\u2019s no difference between Captain America and Black Panther,\u201d Mr. Narcisse, 45, said. But, he added, it also involves \u201ctrying to explain what is special about T\u2019Challa and Wakanda without racism.

It\u2019s projected to make a record-breaking $165 million over Presidents\u2019 Day weekend and comparisons to last year\u2019s \u201cWonder Woman\u201d bode well for its reception and impact, particularly for black people.\n\n\u201cWhite people have the privilege of not constantly being reminded of their race in the United States, where white is the majority, whereas as a black person you don\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Vittrup said. She believes that parents in general, and white parents in particular, are reluctant to talk about race with young children. When they do, they often miss the chance to talk about inequality, even though research supports the idea that children develop an awareness of race and difference at a very young age.\n\nMs. Vittrup was careful to add that dressing as Black Panther isn\u2019t inherently appropriative or offensive. The character comes from an invented African country, and to wear his mask isn\u2019t quite the same as wearing blackface. However, in a moment where even more black heroes, like Luke Cage and Black Lightning, are finding their way into the limelight, Black Panther\u2019s relationship with the black community and its history creates an opportunity to teach nonblack children about the black experience.\n\n\u201cKids are not colorblind,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of structural inequality in our society, and kids are noticing that.

Even the clothes are an 18th-century version of current POTUS style: basic black suit and fat tie. As for Washington, he stands blank-faced, one arm extended, like a tenor taking a dignified bow.\n\n[Read remarks from the Obamas and the artists. ]\n\nUninflected dignity was the attitude of choice for well over a century, with a few breaks. In an 1836 portrait, Andrew Jackson, a demonstrative bully, sports a floor-length, red-silk-lined Dracula cloak and a kind of topiary bouffant. (A picture of Jackson, one of President Trump\u2019s populist heroes, hangs in the Oval Office.) Abraham Lincoln, seen in several likenesses, is exceptional for looking as if he may actually have weighty matters on his mind. Most of the portraits that precede and follow his are pure P.R.\n\nThis continues well into the 20th century. In a 1980 painting Jimmy Carter trades a black suit for a beige one. How revolutionary is that? And there\u2019s a Casual Fridays vogue: Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both go tieless for it. Under the circumstances, Elaine de Kooning\u2019s 1963 portrait of John F. Kennedy, a fanfare of green and blue strokes, hits like a boost of adrenaline. Rousing too, though not in a good way, is a big head shot image of Bill Clinton by the artist Chuck Close. Using his signature mosaic-like painting technique, Mr. Close turns the 42nd president into a pixelated clown.\n\nMr. Obama has much better luck with his similarly high-profile portraitist. Mr. Wiley, born in Los Angeles in 1977, gained a following in the early 2000s with his crisp, glossy, life-size paintings of young African-American men dressed in hip-hop styles, but depicted in the old-master manner of European royal portraits. More recently he has expanded his repertoire to include female subjects, as well as models from Brazil, India, Nigeria and Senegal, creating the collective image of a global black aristocracy.\n\nIn an imposingly scaled painting \u2014 just over seven feet tall \u2014 the artist presents Mr. Obama dressed in the regulation black suit and an open-necked white shirt, and seated on a vaguely thronelike chair not so different from the one seen in Stuart\u2019s Washington portrait. But art historical references stop there. So do tonal echoes of past portraits. Whereas Mr. Obama\u2019s predecessors are, to the man, shown expressionless and composed, Mr. Obama sits tensely forward, frowning, elbows on his knees, arms crossed, as if listening hard. No smiles, no Mr. Nice Guy. He\u2019s still troubleshooting, still in the game.\n\nVideo\n\nHis engaged and assertive demeanor contradicts \u2014 and cosmetically corrects \u2014 the impression he often made in office of being philosophically detached from what was going on around him. At some level, all portraits are propaganda, political or personal. And what makes this one distinctive is the personal part. Mr. Wiley has set Mr. Obama against \u2014 really embedded him in \u2014 a bower of what looks like ground cover. From the greenery sprout flowers that have symbolic meaning for the sitter. African blue lilies represent Kenya, his father\u2019s birthplace; jasmine stands for Hawaii, where Mr. Obama himself was born; chrysanthemums, the official flower of Chicago, reference the city where his political career began, and where he met his wife.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMrs. Obama\u2019s choice of Ms. Sherald as an artist was an enterprising one. Ms. Sherald, who was born in Columbus, Ga., in 1973 and lives in Baltimore, is just beginning to move into the national spotlight after putting her career on hold for some years to deal with a family health crisis, and one of her own. (She had a heart transplant at 39.) Production-wise, she and Mr. Wiley operate quite differently. He runs the equivalent of a multinational art factory, with assistants churning out work. Ms. Sherald, who until a few years ago made her living waiting tables, oversees a studio staff of one, herself.\n\nAt the same time, they have much in common. Both focused early on African-American portraiture precisely because it is so little represented in Western art history. And both tend to blend fact and fiction. Mr. Wiley, with photo-realistic precision, casts actual people in fantastically heroic roles. (He modifies his heroizing in the case of Mr. Obama, but it\u2019s still there.) Ms. Sherald also starts with realism, but softens and abstracts it. She gives all her figures gray-toned skin \u2014 a color with ambiguous racial associations \u2014 and reduces bodies to geometric forms silhouetted against single-color fields.\n\nShe shows Mrs. Obama sitting against a field of light blue, wearing a spreading gown. The dress design, by Michelle Smith, is eye-teasingly complicated: mostly white interrupted by black Op Art-ish blips and patches of striped color suggestive of African textiles. The shape of the dress, rising pyramidally upward, mountain-like, feels as if it were the real subject of the portrait. Mrs. Obama\u2019s face forms the composition\u2019s peak, but could be almost anyone\u2019s face, like a model\u2019s face in a fashion spread. To be honest, I was anticipating \u2014 hoping for \u2014 a bolder, more incisive image of the strong-voiced person I imagine this former first lady to be.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m wishing, let me mention something more. Mr. Obama\u2019s portrait will be installed, long-term, among those of his presidential peers, in a dedicated space on the second floor. Mrs. Obama\u2019s will hang in a corridor reserved for temporary displays of new acquisitions \u2014 on the first floor. It will stay there until November, after which there\u2019s no set-aside place for it to land.\n\nIf first men have an acknowledged showcase, first women \u2014 ladies or not \u2014 should too. Better, they should all be together, sharing space, offering a welcoming environment to, among others, a future first female president, and creating a lasting monument to #MeToo.", "keywords": ["washington", "black", "fiction", "portraits", "obama", "obamas", "mr", "blend", "wiley", "ms", "sherald", "portrait", "politics", "paint", "fact"], "polarity": 0.07208600786186993, "subjectivity": 0.35921572042261696},

While it is true that compared with Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton lost ground with that segment of the electorate, the clues to a new Democratic majority may be found in the coalition that elected Mr. Northam governor of Virginia, or perhaps more accurately, voted against Mr. Gillespie and his immigrant bashing.\n\nIn Virginia, polling data has made it clear that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 rhetoric backfired among minority voters as well as, crucially, among many whites. Mr. Northam won a majority of white college-educated voters, who made up a larger share of the electorate in 2017 than they did in 2016. Mr. Gillespie matched Mr. Trump with noncollege whites, but their turnout was down. And minority voters in 2017 matched their 2016 electorate share \u2014 for the first time ever there was no drop-off from the presidential to the gubernatorial election. The Democrats also expanded their margin of victory in Virginia from five percentage points in 2016 to nine points in 2017.\n\nBefore the vote in Virginia, pundits on both the right and left were speculating that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s anti-immigrant strategy was working. But in the end, election results and polling data in Virginia proved all that thinking was wrong. While each state has its own demographics and distinct politics, Virginia has voters who span demographic and economic spectrums. Majorities of voters of all races and ethnicities rejected anti-immigrant stereotypes as ugly and wrong.\n\nAccording to an election eve survey of voters by Latino Decisions, Latino voters said that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads made them less enthusiastic about him, by a 45-point margin. But it wasn\u2019t just Latino voters. By a 23-point margin (52 to 29), whites in Virginia also said the MS-13 ads turned them away from Mr. Gillespie, as did African-American and Asian-American voters by larger margins.\n\nData speaks louder than punditry, and our regression analysis of survey data paints a clear picture. Exposure to Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads actually helped drive white college-educated voters away from the Republicans. When we analyzed findings for white independents and Republicans, voters who were aware of the MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Mr. Gillespie\u2019s Democratic opponent. What should be alarming for Republicans is that this effect wasn\u2019t limited to the governor\u2019s race. The Gillespie campaign had coattail effects, but of the wrong stripe. Across all racial groups, those who were aware of Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Democratic candidates for Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates.\n\nThis means that not only is it morally just for Democrats to position themselves as the party that stands against hatred and bigotry and in favor of inclusiveness and opportunity, but it is also a strategically sound position for winning votes. Simultaneously, it sends a clear, welcoming message to Latino, African-American and Asian-American voters, while also winning over enough of the white voters who also oppose immigrant bashing.\n\nThis phenomenon is particularly true of voters who will decide crucial House and Senate races in 2018: people of color and white college-educated voters \u2014 also known as the Democratic base. Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans are clearly gearing up for a similar anti-immigrant effort in 2018. But now the mask has been pulled off. Voters get it. Democrats have an opportunity to speak out strongly against bigotry. And in doing so, they have a path to victory in 2018 and beyond.", "keywords": ["immigration", "virginia", "ms13", "ads", "win", "democrats", "mr", "white", "vote", "gillespies", "voters", "republicans"], "polarity": 0.10965551203646441, "subjectivity": 0.4705427288760622},

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nYet, despite the obvious truth of that statement, we may wonder: What are the moral and political arguments that underwrite the claim that black lives matter? While there is no way to articulate the full scope of those arguments in a single essay, it\u2019s worth considering the philosophical contributions of some of the forerunners of the movement that is our most urgent manifestation of black thought today.\n\nThe end of the Civil War and the subsequent ratification of the 13th Amendment in 1865 legally abolished slavery, but blacks quickly became subject to a displaced form of violence at the hands of white supremacists across the nation who typically used false accusations of sexual assault to justify lynching black men. Police turned a blind eye to these murders, and sometimes actively facilitated them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIda B. Wells, a leading black thinker and journalist in the late-19th and early 20th centuries, and a co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, built a public career documenting lynchings and calling America to account for them. Her arguments extended and amplified those made by Frederick Douglass before her. Douglass\u2019s central claim in his seminal \u201cThe Meaning of July Fourth for the Negro\u201d was that Americans should feel shame for slavery, given their country\u2019s foundational commitment to liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We were failing our own ideals.\n\nWells pointed to the rise of lynching after the fall of slavery as not merely a legal matter to be rectified with new laws. Having fled her hometown to escape threats of her own lynching, Wells used the press to make her moral arguments. She described a nation in the grip of a dark remorse for freeing black Americans from slavery, and condemned white Americans for cruelties that violated their own commitment to the democratic project.\n\nThe horrors that Wells described were a factor in the Great Migration of blacks to the North, which fed the flourishing of black thought and cultural life that gave rise to the Harlem Renaissance. An indication that the Harlem Renaissance was always meant to be a period of radical black philosophy and social change was the name originally coined for the movement: The New Negro. Alain Locke, the Harvard-educated black intellectual who became known as the father of the Harlem Renaissance, envisioned a philosophical position that reinvigorated blacks\u2019 relationship to their culture and that would in turn solidify their status as equal co-participants in our democracy.\n\nA strong theme among some of the luminaries of the time focused on the will of blacks to assert their humanity against racism and to insist on their status as persons owed respect. Among those stars, the poet Langston Hughes was one of the brightest. His \u201cI Too\u201d is a quiet yet insistent poem depicting a black man employed by a white one and his struggle with invisibility. The protagonist resolves to sit at the table with the white folks the next day and show people how beautiful he is and that he, too, is America. The writer Zora Neale Hurston had an equally persistent but at times more playful take on the matter. In her essay \u201cHow It Feels to Be Colored Me,\u201d she wrote, \u201cSometimes, I feel discriminated against, but it does not make me angry. It merely astonishes me. How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company! It\u2019s beyond me.\u201d\n\nThinkers like Hughes and Hurston were involved in the Harlem Renaissance project of presenting a vision of black cultural vitality and worth that would rework the image of black Americans that whites typically relied upon. That stream of thought runs directly into the heart of Black Lives Matter.\n\nAnother valuable and necessary development to come out of the Black Lives Matter movement is the de-emphasizing of black patriarchy and the equal acknowledgment of the suffering of black women and the black L.G.T.B.Q. community. Though sexuality was an avenue of inquiry during the Harlem Renaissance, it was perhaps the mid- to late-20th century poet and theorist Audre Lorde who did the most to make black women\u2019s sexuality a focal point of political and social philosophy.\n\nWhile today \u201cintersectionality\u201d is bandied about as the cutting edge of social research, it was Lorde who in her writing insisted on complicating our view of personal identity by claiming that each of us belongs to multiple identity communities, all of which contribute to our sense of self and our purposes.\n\nShe also showed the broad reach of white supremacy and its effects on black Americans as they located themselves in more nuanced ways in the tapestry of American culture. For her, the primary form taken by resistance to racism was the denial of blunt categories imposed on black Americans, which stifled the possibility of an individual\u2019s full flourishing. Lorde, then, called for a radical form of self-possession whose boundaries were not open to negotiation with a white society.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen people think of Black Lives Matter, they often think of anger feeding forceful protests. Anger is a reasonable response to racial injustice. To be certain, groups like the Black Panthers and thinkers like Malcolm X advised black Americans to get angry and take the doctrine of armed self-defense seriously. Though anger and love are not mutually exclusive emotions, James Baldwin and Martin Luther King Jr. affirmed a view of civic love to pre-empt the need for violence.\n\nKing espoused a form of Kantian regard that prioritized conceiving of every human, racist or not, as owed a kind of love that is grounded in the ideal of universal respect. Baldwin held a slightly different view. He felt black Americans ought to see whites as democratic kin or family, as people with whom blacks would have serious quarrels but also people whom it would be worth keeping close in order to strengthen and bring integrity to the bonds of shared democratic life. These two views of love eschewed violence yet insisted on militancy. While forgiveness and acceptance were hallmarks of King\u2019s and Baldwin\u2019s views, so was an unyielding commitment to self-respect and the demand for social change to institutionalize the idea that blacks were co-creators of the American kingdom.\n\nThinkers like Wells, Hughes, Hurston, Lorde and Baldwin not only anticipated the current Black Lives Matter movement but provided an intellectual blueprint to give depth and integrity to that slogan, so that its meaning transcends the demand to stop police brutality. It is a demand for whites to extend their historical imagination and recognize that the ills of racism are not the result of a few bad police officers or a few out-and-out racists in some far-off corner of America. The problem, rather, is a kind of complicity \u2014 one partaking in the false comfort that America has somehow escaped the trajectory of its racially murderous history. It is necessary that we to see our society today as continuous with that history and not anomalous to it.\n\nBlack thought\u2019s primary contribution to the academy and to American society is the richness and precision with which it describes our worst demons to us, while offering a vision of how we might each save our democracy from the ruin of irrational fear and hatred.", "keywords": ["black", "blacks", "white", "showed", "america", "renaissance", "movement", "harlem", "americans", "lives", "matter"], "polarity": 0.043612258953168, "subjectivity": 0.3973699190419967},

Bell Pottinger may have set back race relations in South Africa by as much as 10 years.\u201d\n\nWithin days of the firm\u2019s removal from the trade association, clients were fleeing. By the end of September, all 250 employees were laid off and Bell Pottinger was finished.\n\nA Unique Client List\n\nLondon is now home to a cluster of P.R. firms catering to foreign governments, raising worries that the city has become \u201cthe global capital of reputation laundering,\u201d as The Evening Standard put it a few years ago.

He came to fame with the \u201cLabour isn\u2019t working\u201d ads that helped the Conservative Party gain control of Parliament in the 1979 general election.

When the pair started working together in the mid-80s, Mr. Bell was sought after by political leaders and corporations who wanted some of the communications magic he had provided to Mrs. Thatcher.\n\nBell Pottinger quickly had hundreds of clients, a few of them infamous. Mr. Bell attributes his ability to work with virtually anyone to innate optimism.\n\n\u201cI see the good in people,\u201d he said.\n\nThis included Chile\u2019s former dictator Augusto Pinochet. Mr. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain in 1998 as part of an effort to deport him to Spain, where he had been indicted on a charge of torturing Spanish citizens.\n\nAfter two years of legal and political wrangling, Mr. Bell and his allies prevailed when Mr. Pinochet was authorized to freely return to Chile.\n\nBell Pottinger was hardly the only British outfit working for rogues and despots, as well as publicly traded companies, nor was it the largest or most profitable. But it had a buccaneering spirit that made it the firm of choice for a wide variety of missions.\n\n\n\nDuring the war in Iraq, Bell Pottinger had a contract with the Pentagon to produce propaganda for the United States military. This included scripts in Arabic for a soap opera that aired in the country, said Mr. Bell.\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen the company\u2019s client list did not generate news, its methods did. In 2011, it was caught boasting about its skills in the dark arts of search engine manipulation to people it thought were potential clients.\n\nIn fact, they were undercover members of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit organization that works with a variety of media. Posing as executives from the made-up Azimov Group, these \u201crepresentatives\u201d said the company had ties to the Uzbekistan regime, which has been criticized for repression and for using forced child labor during its cotton harvest.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Azimov executives said they worried about blowback.\n\nFret not, said Tim Collins, a Bell Pottinger managing director, per transcripts published by The Independent, a British newspaper. After the company applied its tech wizardry, \u201cYou get to the point where even if they type in \u2018Uzbek child labour\u2019 or \u2018Uzbek human rights violation,\u2019 some of the first results that come up are sites talking about what you guys are doing to address and improve that, not just the critical voices saying how terrible this all is.\u201d\n\nMr. Bell never challenged the transcripts, but he denounced the sting at the time as an \u201cunethical, underhand deception to manufacture a story where none exists.\u201d\n\nBeginning of the End\n\nBell Pottinger\u2019s slide into oblivion began with a visit to the Guptas in January 2016. Mr. Bell, who had worked in South Africa for years, said he had no idea what the brothers wanted, but he and several colleagues flew to Johannesburg to find out.\n\n\u201cWe went to this bloody great mansion, which seemed to be their headquarters,\u201d Mr. Bell recalled. \u201cGreat big room, huge sofas all over the place. Servants. Appalling, all of it.\u201d\n\nThe family already had a fortune, Tony Gupta told the small entourage. Now, he and his brothers wanted to help poor blacks. To that end, they wanted a P.R. campaign that pushed the idea of economic emancipation.\n\n\u201cSo we went back to London and wrote a strategy,\u201d said Mr. Bell. \u201cTown hall meetings, marching in the street, that kind of thing. Draw attention to the economic imbalance, then tell people they should protest and demand change.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe company drafted a two-page proposal, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times. Among its recommendations was \u201ca non-party political narrative around the existence of economic apartheid\u201d that Bell Pottinger would package \u201cinto speeches, news releases, website content, videos/broadcast content, slogans and other material required.\u201d\n\nSoon, the Guptas said that their company needed communications help, too. Most South Africans, the Guptas maintained, had an inflated notion of how much of the family\u2019s revenue came from government contracts, which harmed their interests, several Bell Pottinger employees recalled.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe corporate campaign was the first sign that altruism had little to do with the \u00a3100,000 a month that Bell Pottinger would earn during what was initially a three-month project. The second was the anger of the company\u2019s other South Africa clients when they learned of the arrangement.\n\nThe billionaire Johann Rupert was aghast to suddenly find himself one of the most prominent examples of \u201cwhite monopoly capital.\u201d He texted Mr. Bell and asked how his P.R. firm could also be working for a family that was bashing him. Mr. Bell, by his own account, quickly lost enthusiasm for the Gupta project.\n\n\u201cIt was altogether smelly,\u201d he said of the racial element of the work. But he quickly added that ethics were not the issue. If enough South African clients quit Bell Pottinger, he reasoned, the losses would outweigh the Guptas\u2019s checks. \u201cI was saying it\u2019s not a commercially sensible thing to do.\u201d\n\nBut by the end of March, only one client \u2014 the banking and asset management company Investec \u2014 had severed ties with the P.R. firm. After that, Bell Pottinger tried to find middle ground by signing a new contract with the Guptas, this time with a codicil literally called an anti-embarrassment clause. It allowed the firm to terminate the account \u201cwithout notice\u201d if the brothers brought discredit to the business.\n\nMr. Bell said he soon resolved to quit the company because he felt undermined and undervalued by Mr. Henderson. \u201cHe made my life a misery from start to finish,\u201d said Mr. Bell, speaking one recent afternoon in the living room of his home near London\u2019s Sloane Square. After negotiating a \u00a33.5 million exit package, Mr. Bell resigned in August 2016.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor his part, Mr. Henderson declined in a recent interview to indulge in the put-downs that come so easily to his antagonist. Seated at a conference table in temporary offices in Mayfair, where he is starting a new P.R. firm, he said Bell Pottinger\u2019s dissolution was too recent to discuss.\n\n\u201cI have huge empathy for all those impacted,\u201d he said, \u201cand believe now is not the appropriate time to go into details.\u201d\n\nInflaming Tensions\n\nThe P.R. campaign in South Africa, which started in 2016, was intended to raise the temperature of race relations. And it worked.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore than 100 fake Twitter accounts were created, all of them retweeting content from other Twitter accounts with names like @economycapture, according to media reports. Popular hashtags included #WhiteMonopolyCapital and #RespectGuptas. The campaign involved some 220,000 tweets.\n\nThere were also attack website with names like WMC Leaks and WMC Scams. Another part of this ecosystem were mainstream media outlets owned by the Guptas, like ANN7, a 24-hour news channel, and The New Age, a daily newspaper.\n\nAs the campaign spread, leaders at groups like the A.N.C. Youth League gave inflammatory speeches, decrying the \u201cstranglehold\u201d that rich whites had on the economy. Leaked emails would later show that the groups received media training, and in some cases funds, from Oakbay.\n\nAn atmosphere of menace slowly pervaded the country. In July 2016, the police minister announced the creation of a task force to investigate the murder of more than a dozen political figures. In the run-up to municipal elections that year, Mr. Zuma described the Democratic Alliance, the A.N.C.\u2019s main rival, as a \u201cwhite party,\u201d adding that it could not \u201crun this country no matter how they cover up by getting a few black stooges.\u201d\n\nNew and radical groups like Black First Land First sprang up, holding public rallies to fulminate against whites. At one, in May 2016, a pastor named Xola Skosana told the crowd, \u201cWe have been wounded beyond measure. Let us find the pillars and bring the house down. Black people must be avenged.\u201d\n\nFor the first time in years, whites felt a rising sense of personal danger. Nicholas Wolpe, a white South African whose father was a pioneer of the anti-apartheid movement, remembers a palpable anxiety. \u201cThere was a shift toward intolerance,\u201d he said. \u201cGradually, the debate about white monopoly capital was everywhere and the people talking about it were loud and belligerent. It struck a nerve.\u201d\n\nIn a related and surreptitious campaign, the Guptas were being recast as warmhearted people eager to help the downtrodden. A website connected to Black First Land First ran editorials defending the brothers, suggesting in one that they should be \u201cpraised for saving jobs.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["met", "bell", "pr", "pottinger", "despots", "mr", "firm", "main", "end", "rogues", "company", "south", "campaign", "guptas", "reading", "africa"], "polarity": 0.05728090899659527, "subjectivity": 0.3829289628309236},

The scene never made it into the movie. So, what happened? In a conversation with ScreenCrush\u2019s E. Oliver Whitney, the screenwriter Joe Robert Cole, one of the writers for \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d says he vaguely recalls some discussion of whether to include the lesbian love story. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t some major theme through that we were looking to explore with [those characters] in terms of the story,\u201d Cole clarifies. \u201cWe didn\u2019t like, pull out a full thread of some theme.\u201d\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t Play With Our Emotions: \u201cBlack Panther\u201d and Queer Representation\u2019 [The Root]\n\nBriana Lawrence, who identifies as a queer black woman, was surprised that the scene\u2019s exclusion didn\u2019t bother her. \u201cI should\u2019ve been cursing Ryan Coogler out, swift and fast like my mama taught me when someone pisses me off,\u201d she writes. \u201cBut after thinking it over, I\u2019m happy the scene didn\u2019t make it into the movie, and that feels blasphemous to admit as someone who is always championing representation \u2014 especially for queer folks of color like me.\u201d\n\nHeartwarming Bonus Read: \u2018I Took 7th Graders to See \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d Here\u2019s What They Said.\u2019 [The New York Times]\n\nProf. Kevin Noble Maillard watched the film with a handful of tweens from a Brooklyn public school.

Alex Bowman, 24, who replaced Earnhardt in the No. 88 car for Hendrick Motorsports, will start the Daytona 500 from the pole position. Elliott and Blaney will be in the second row after winning the qualifying duels Thursday.\n\nOne driver in particular has the potential to do more than anyone to shake up the sport. A graduate of Nascar\u2019s Drive for Diversity program, Darrell Wallace Jr., 24, could give stock car racing something it has never had before: an African-American star.\n\nBut that is not why Richard Petty brought Wallace onto his team. Late last season, Wallace, who goes by the nickname Bubba, got four rides with Richard Petty Motorsports. It was enough for Petty, one of Nascar\u2019s most iconic names, to not only give Wallace a full-time ride, but also to give him his famed No. 43 racecar to drive. Wallace is the first African-American to drive full-time in the top Nascar series since Wendell Scott in 1971.\n\nPetty insisted, though, that he is colorblind when it comes to evaluating talent. Sure, it would be great if Wallace brings the sport into the African-American community, but as far as Petty is concerned, that\u2019s secondary.\n\n\u201cI hope he advances us as a race team,\u201d Petty said in an email. \u201cI care about what Bubba can do behind the wheel for us. The rest, there are a lot of eyes on Bubba, but he\u2019s handling it well. I know come Sunday he\u2019ll be ready to get into a racecar and just show his talent. If he does well, the rest will come and he\u2019ll grow our fan base.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThose eyes on Wallace, much as they were on Tiger Woods a generation ago, prompted Earnhardt to call him last week. The son of racing legend, Earnhardt knows all about the pressure of expectations.\n\n\u201cHe told me that the next few weeks will basically be hell with all the off-the-track stuff,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cBut he said it\u2019ll all be worth it because I have an opportunity to do things outside the sport that not many other drivers will ever say they\u2019ve had that kind of opportunity to do. So embrace it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe child of a white father and a black mother, Wallace said that he does not quite understand why his skin color makes him newsworthy in 2018. But he knows that stock car racing, with its Southern roots and the Confederate flags that still wave from some fans\u2019 campers and cars, has not attracted an African-American audience.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But there\u2019s also venturing out into a different market, into different avenues where the African-American culture lives. We all have to do better at that.\u201d\n\nThere are challenges, of course. On social media, where vulgar epithets can be spewed from faceless and fictitious monikers, Wallace has, at times, had to think twice before responding. He admits he has not always been successful.\n\n\u201cThere is always going to be haters out there, people who don\u2019t want to see you succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that since Day 1 from my parents. Just keep your head down and keep moving, that\u2019s the best you can do.\u201d\n\nBlaney, his closest friend on the circuit, has been around Wallace when offensive remarks have been made.\n\n\u201cThankfully, it\u2019s very, very rare, but it upsets me,\u201d Blaney said. \u201cBubba\u2019s great at handling it. He\u2019s an amazing ambassador for the sport. And he\u2019s really talented and a heck of a competitor. All of us are competitive, but his competitiveness is unlike anyone I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nNascar\u2019s diversity has become an issue again after its only female racer, Danica Patrick, announced she will retire from the circuit after the Daytona 500. But Wallace is not the only driver who can energize an overlooked community. What he can do for an African-American audience, Su\u00e1rez can do for the Latino market.

Townships have gotten electricity and more modern housing. Government contracts have been set aside for black would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nThese programs have had an impact, improving material conditions and generating jobs.\n\nThey have also been riddled with corruption.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt local governments across South Africa, bureaucrats have abused their authority to steer contracts to companies that put cash in their pockets. At every level of society, people have grown accustomed to kickbacks and political connections determining who prospers, and who goes without.\n\nMr. Zuma\u2019s demise resonates as a sign of a potential new order taking shape. He will forever be linked to his association with the Guptas, three Indian-born brothers who effectively bought key levers of governmental power, amassing influence so comprehensive that it became known as \u201cstate capture.\u201d\n\nHis resignation has raised hopes that South Africa is finally contending with its epidemic of corruption. That view gained momentum when an elite police unit raided a home belonging to the Guptas nearly at the same moment that Mr. Ramaphosa was assuming office.\n\nThe new president is a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle, a former deputy president and chairman of the National Planning Commission, a focal point for thinking about how to engineer economic growth. As a former trade union leader and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Mandela, he enjoys credibility among a range of interest groups, while carrying a reputation as a savvy and strategic operator.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe has had his brushes with controversy, most notably after a 2012 police massacre of striking platinum miners that killed 34 people. At the time, Mr. Ramaphosa occupied a seat on the board of Lonmin, the company that owned the mine. Emails soon surfaced showing that, a day before the police opened fire, Mr. Ramaphosa had been urging senior government officials to take strong action to end the strike.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, no corruption charges have stuck to the new president, who now claims a mandate to clean up the toxic mess left behind by Mr. Zuma.\n\nSome doubt whether the A.N.C. can be salvaged as an effective vehicle for egalitarian policymaking. The party\u2019s executive ranks include many figures implicated in corruption. Mr. Ramaphosa, 65, may champion new initiatives aimed at generating economic growth, yet he finds himself relying on his party brethren to execute his visions, with no certainty that the money will land where intended.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think that taking the president out does much to dismantle the patronage network,\u201d said Ayabonga Cawe, a development economist at Xesibe Holdings, a research and advisory firm in Johannesburg. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need a lot more than taking out the guy at the top.\u201d\n\nAbove all, Mr. Ramaphosa must contend with the structural defects that have long constrained South Africa\u2019s economy, a legacy of apartheid.\n\nBeyond its systemic discrimination against black people, apartheid severed the country from much of the global economy. It ensured that huge numbers of uneducated black South Africans were available at poverty-level wages within major sectors of the economy like mining, agriculture and textiles. That cushioned domestic companies from the pressure to modernize.\n\nPhoto\n\nInternational sanctions isolated South Africa, shielding its firms from competition against multinational rivals. Sanctions also denied South African companies the ability to operate abroad, giving them an incentive to focus on the domestic market. The apartheid-era government obliged with subsidies for favored firms while allowing companies to pursue oligopoly, free of nuisances like antitrust law.\n\nThe result was a system in which large industries, from retail to furniture-making to chemicals, were dominated by huge enterprises whose core strength was the ability to protect themselves against competition. That system has largely prevailed, with smaller companies and start-ups facing often-impossible odds.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cApartheid was a system that lends itself to large conglomerates and concentrations of wealth in the hands of a few,\u201d Mr. Cawe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the corruption. It\u2019s about all of these parallel networks in big business that you need to dismantle. Most of those are white.\u201d\n\nHere is a world that Mr. Ramaphosa knows keenly, having achieved extraordinary affluence by running South African companies with interests in mining, banking, real estate and telecommunications. His fortune has been estimated at $450 million.\n\nIf he is serious about reinvigorating the economy and creating a space for black-owned small businesses, he will need to take on the prevailing structure that made him so wealthy.\n\nHis success on that front may be even more decisive than whether he can tame corruption.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly the most optimistic moment for South Africa in a very long time,\u201d said Mr. Goldin, the former adviser to Mr. Mandela. \u201cIn a way, it does feel like a new beginning.

The aggressive pace of deportations of immigrants of color, the elimination of the DACA program protecting immigrant children and the proposals propounded by the anti-immigration voices in the administration will all have the undeniable effect of slowing the rapid racial diversification of the United States population. Despite this sweeping attempt at racial social engineering, few voices in progressive and Democratic circles are responding with the kinds of outrage that one would expect.\n\nThe pro-white preferences of Donald Trump and his administration, especially when it comes to immigration, are legion. From the day he opened his presidential campaign in 2015 by demonizing Mexicans to the enthusiasm generated by the calls for building a wall along the Mexican border to aggressively ramping up deportations of immigrants of color to eliminating DACA to vulgarly denigrating African nations and Haiti, this administration has been quite clear about its preference for white people.\n\nIt should be no surprise, then, that the immigration policies championed by the White House would all have the effect of reducing the number of people of color coming into the country. A recent study by The Washington Post found that the administration\u2019s proposals to curtail legal immigration by limiting family reunification would slightly delay the date when whites become a minority. \u201cBy greatly slashing the number of Hispanic and black African immigrants entering America, this proposal would reshape the future United States,\u201d the economist Michael Clemens said.\n\n\u201cDecades ahead,\u201d he added, \u201cmany fewer of us would be nonwhite or have nonwhite people in our families.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe administration\u2019s focus is not random.

People of color used to make up 12 percent of the United States population in 1965, and that percentage has more than tripled over the past several decades to the point where nonwhite people are nearly 39 percent of the residents of the United States (it is no accident that the country\u2019s first African-American president was elected when he was elected).

The very first immigration law passed, the Naturalization Act of 1790, declared that to become a citizen, one had to be a \u201cfree white person.\u201d That demarcation was the explicit law of the land for the next 162 years, until 1952. There are 20th-century Supreme Court cases explicitly holding that Asian immigrants could not become United States citizens because they were not white. Even after 1952, the practical effect of immigration policy continued to promote white people above others through mechanisms such as the Asia Pacific Triangle, which restricted immigration from Asian countries.", "keywords": ["immigration", "color", "white", "trump", "wants", "states", "america", "immigrants", "effect", "sign", "united", "nonwhite", "population"], "polarity": 0.07678771845438513, "subjectivity": 0.2882194965528299},

Almost all of those who led the campaign to bring him to account were black, like Thuli Madonsela, the former public protector, who played a heroic role in exposing Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption. South Africa\u2019s judiciary, which is majority black, defended the independence of the courts with extraordinary courage and under great pressure. After this display of black courage, why would it matter what white people think?\n\nBut South Africa is too fraught and complex a place for such a simple story to ring true. More plausible is that each pinprick penetrating Mr. Zuma\u2019s skin is felt by black South Africans, even those who are horrified by what he has done.\n\nBeneath the surface of public life, one can detect a strange, subliminal to-and-fro. Last year, for instance, a superb book describing in meticulous detail the deep corruption of the late apartheid years, \u201cApartheid Guns and Money,\u201d by Hennie van Vuuren, was a runaway best seller. It deserved to be widely read, but the scale of its success is partly a function of its utility as a weapon against white arrogance. \u201cHowever bad Zuma is,\u201d its many black readers could say to themselves, \u201cyou people were worse.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

For the truth is that Mr. Zuma and his allies were corrupt partly because they felt a sense of grievance intimately connected to their experience of race.\n\nWhen Mr. Zuma became president of South Africa in 2009, he rallied behind him an alliance of people who felt themselves to be marginal and neglected, not just in relation to the world economic order or white South Africa but also in relation to the A.N.C. itself. The A.N.C. has been run by people drawn from the ranks of an urbane, cosmopolitan elite.\n\nMr. Zuma represented a dramatic change in this tradition. Although he spent years in exile and climbed the ranks of the A.N.C., his biography was unlike any of his predecessors\u2019. Nelson Mandela was born into royalty. Thabo Mbeki was the son of prominent intellectuals. Mr. Zuma\u2019s mother worked in the kitchen of a white family and was too poor to provide her son with a formal education. He grew up herding cattle in the hinterland.\n\nWhen he came to power in 2009, he did so with the support of organizations representing much of the urban working class \u2014 the country\u2019s largest trade union and the South African Communist Party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut he soon dropped these organizations and turned for support to rural South Africa, in particular to traditional leaders and to the elites of far-flung provincial capitals. They carried with them into power an abiding sense of powerlessness, a feeling that the very institutions they now controlled were alien and belonged to others. In office, they believed that they had entered into their enemy\u2019s mansion. It seemed to be payback time.\n\nIn a speech delivered to a room of black businesspeople in December 2016, Mr. Zuma warned of the sophisticated ways in which the enemy confuses black people. One source of such confusion was the prevailing economic orthodoxy. Mr. Zuma suggested that the most fundamental of economic laws was merely nominal; remove the scales from our eyes and we see that so-called economic laws are a ruse invented by the powerful.\n\nHis genre of criminality is light-years from the sort that characterized the apartheid state. The corruption of apartheid\u2019s leaders stemmed from arrogance; they believed that they could control the world forever. Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption stems from the grievances of a man who feels very small.\n\nThis sense of grievance was on display in the last words he uttered publicly as president. In a swipe at his successor, Mr. Ramaphosa, Mr. Zuma suggested that those in the party who had unseated him were \u201cserving the interests of the oppressors of yesteryear, who joyfully celebrate as we lynch one another.\u201d\n\nBlack nationalism in South Africa has many faces. Mr. Ramaphosa represents a strand that is bourgeois, worldly and comfortable with power. There is also a militant, socialist strand of black nationalism, but it is on the wane. And there is the strand represented by Mr. Zuma, who governed as a man shaped and distorted by the violence and oppression of white supremacy.\n\nI am of course alive to the irony of a white South African like me saying that a black president\u2019s corruption was motivated by racial grievance. Many South Africans, black and white, would regard this argument as an excuse for the intolerable. But we should be honest enough to accept that even now, notwithstanding that apartheid has been gone since before nearly half the South African population was born, the legacy of white supremacy has lived on in the man who was president.", "keywords": ["whats", "black", "corruption", "jacob", "zumas", "economic", "mr", "white", "south", "distinctive", "africa", "apartheid", "zuma", "mess"], "polarity": 0.0616115067727971, "subjectivity": 0.37158776707163793},

Evenly lit, crisply photographed, they look like pictures from an illustrated medical dictionary, indexical images of heads, torsos and mouths that are detached from context. Even in a work like \u201cFigure\u201d (1991), the figure in question, sheathed in a black dress and set in the black infinity of no particular place, feels like a fragment, as though she had been extracted from a group photo or a furnished room. The texts accompanying her, eight engraved plastic plaques, read like excerpts from a language primer: \u201cfigured the worst,\u201d \u201che was disfigured,\u201d \u201cfigured there would be no reaction\u201d and so on. Here, not only has the story been winnowed down; it is in fact completely gone. There\u2019s no story. We are left with only the tensions of concrete poetry.\n\nSometime in the mid-1990s, Simpson began to detect clich\u00e9d responses to her work. At the same time, her own thinking was evolving. What does an image of a black woman mean? A commentary on race? An assertion about gender? Simpson branched out from figure-based images and began to experiment more with varied subject matter \u2014 landscapes and inanimate objects like wigs \u2014 and also with unusual quasi-sculptural material like felt and standing screens. A series of monumental multisectional images, several of them landscapes, collectively titled \u201cPublic Sex\u201d (1995-1998) and featuring no figures at all, addressed the provocative title only obliquely. These pictures, made over many years, contain what the scholar and curator Okwui Enwezor calls \u201cthe rumor of the body.\u201d Mysteries of a jagged and deadpan sort, they would go on to influence the noirish tone of Simpson\u2019s later film work.\n\nPhoto\n\nSimpson began to set ever more intricate conceptual layers between her initial inspiration for a work and the finished product. The idea for \u201c9 Props\u201d (1995) began during a residency at the Pilchuck Glass School in Washington. With the aid of artisans at the school, she fabricated a series of dark vessels modeled on vases and other objects used in the portrait work of the pioneering Harlem photographer James Van Der Zee. But these vessels were not the final work. She shipped them back to New York and then photographed them against a plain background. And that still was not the work. Further intervention followed: She turned those photographic images into nine lithographs, which she printed on felt. Finally, she wrote captions below each lithographed vessel, describing the context in which it originally appeared. One of them, for instance, reads:\n\nDinner Party with boxer Harry Wills, 1926 James VanDerZee Harry Wills a k a \u201cThe Black Panther,\u201d boxer, businessman- sits with seven other men and women, mostly women with champagne glasses raised as a woman on his left makes a toast in his honor. There are three bottles of champagne, a crystal decanter, a bottle of port, an arrangement of flowers and fruit, and before each guest an untouched china place setting.\n\nPhoto\n\nFrom multiple directions, the work gestures at what cannot be seen: the original placement of the vessels that inspired Simpson\u2019s own, the people in the photographs by James Van Der Zee, the social life of Harlem evoked by his photographs and the complexity of manners and class implied by them. All that vanished world of culture and experience is reduced to an elegant grid, as simple as an antiquarian\u2019s catalog, a thought picture that demands calm engagement and imaginative intervention on the viewer\u2019s part. Without being representational, it is about race; but race is not off in some category by itself, hemmed in only by questions of skin color, separate from life.\n\n\u201cRepresent!\u201d in the black American sense means standing up for your people, expressing solidarity and letting a shared ethos underwrite your presence and work. It is an exhortation, a greeting and a farewell. The word also has more conventional associations. In the visual arts, it is contrasted with the abstract or the symbolic. To represent, in this more common sense, is to make work that visually corresponds to realities out there in the world: to illustrate uncomplicatedly. This second sense of \u201crepresent\u201d is enjoying a vogue in the art world. Realism is back. This is welcome: after so long an absence of black figures and black faces in art museums, they are now being seen more frequently. Many artists, black and otherwise, are depicting the black body. It is necessary and often successful. Just as often, it fails when it is little more than a clumsy shorthand for socially concerned art, unobjectionable and unimpressive.\n\nA strong appeal of Simpson\u2019s work is that she has always embraced the inherent complexity of blackness, her own blackness as well as the blackness that runs ineluctably through American history. She does not reject representational depictions, but neither does she feel the need to confine herself only to \u201crace\u201d work. When an artist uses a black model, she is presenting a human question by foregrounding a human presence. Is a white man a person while a black woman is and can only be a gendered and racialized subject? As the scholar Kellie Jones has pointed out, nonwhite bodies are often thought of as \u201cnot neutral enough for the dispassionate formulas thought to constitute conceptual practice.\u201d If a black woman\u2019s race and gender are the only things apparent to certain viewers, Simpson seems to say, the ethical responsibility to escape those shackles is the viewer\u2019s.\n\nFreedom is Lorna Simpson\u2019s starting point and her permanent theme. A humane current animates all of her work, a current that neither sidesteps nor confines itself to race. Her work is simultaneously about the \u201cneutral\u201d space of ideas and the particularized experience of the body. \u201cMontage\u201d is photographic and painterly, a riff on a pair of found photographs, sequenced to look like a giant strip of film. It deals with dreams and nightmares, ambiguities and vulnerabilities. At its heart is what Simpson calls \u201cthe push and pull of photography\u201d: the stuttering potential inherent in mechanical reproduction and the imperfect registrations that mirror subconscious life. It is a rapid response to the current political climate, situating a crucial part of it in the most intimate space of all, where the hectoring \u201cthey\u201d is temporarily held at bay in favor of the puzzled \u201cI.\u201d In your own sleeping bed, images persist and words are hard to come by.

This is a key piece that I don\u2019t think people really get: When you talk about the press, it\u2019s not about journalists; it\u2019s about the free-flowing information that the American public is supposed to get. When you bash the press, you\u2019re bashing the idea of getting truth out.\n\nWhat\u2019s the public opinion of the White House press corps? It depends on whom you talk to. We\u2019re so tribal now. There used to be a day when you didn\u2019t know the person\u2019s politics. The line has been obscured between facts and opinion. I think it started during the Clinton years, and it just kept getting progressively worse. People don\u2019t want to just hear the news; they want to hear what people have to say about it too.\n\nYour reactions during the televised briefings have generated memes. Has it made you more self-conscious? I\u2019m so sad about that. My boss has always said, \u201cYou need to know how to play poker.\u201d I don\u2019t. I\u2019m trying! The last time I was really caught off guard was when Sarah Huckabee Sanders said something about people\u2019s minds being in the gutter after President Trump\u2019s tweet about Kirsten Gillibrand. I really get into those briefings. I really try to listen. I don\u2019t play to the camera. I go in there, and I\u2019m really earnest. So when she said that, I was shocked! I was like, No, God, that was a little bit much.\n\nGiven how much you tangle with this particular administration, why do you think you get called on so much? Have you felt like a target? Yes, I have. But I have to shake that off, because I have to go in and do my job. I cover the White House. I cover all issues, particularly those that affect black and brown Americans. Now, what if they didn\u2019t call on me? A certain segment of America would not get the answers to some of their pressing questions. If I don\u2019t ask, who will?\n\nRyan is the White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks and a political analyst for CNN.

You had to ask whether this president believed slavery was wrong. I recently asked him, \u201cAre you a racist?\u201d It\u2019s a sad day when you have to ask a sitting president that. There has been a series of comments or lack of action, from calling Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas\u201d to how he dealt with Charlottesville to his comments on Norway versus Haiti, Africa, El Salvador, black and brown nations. It\u2019s not been one thing. It\u2019s been a pattern. So I asked. He did not answer, which I thought was a wasted moment. He could have put it to rest right then and there and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a racist.\u201d But it took him days to say that.\n\nYou said it seems as if it has changed, going forward, how the White House deals with the press corps and wields its power. What do you think this means for the next president you cover? He\u2019ll clamp down harder on us. Each president has pushed us further away from access. Who knows what will happen or what another president may want? They may not want to be followed. President Obama didn\u2019t like being followed, for example. This president hates us. He\u2019s warring on us. Once we lose ground on something, it\u2019s hard to get it back.", "keywords": ["really", "press", "didnt", "house", "questions", "white", "political", "think", "president", "dont", "im", "ryan", "asks", "ask"], "polarity": -0.020396090534979424, "subjectivity": 0.313969723691946},

Just like our kid who\u2019s not white dresses up like Captain America. I think the beautiful thing about comics is they do transcend race in a lot of ways.\u201d\n\nMary Dimacali, 29, a social media and marketing manager in Rockland County, New York, echoed that idea. She does not believe that her fianc\u00e9\u2019s 7-year-old son, Sawyer, who is white, sees the film or its characters through the lens of race. Sawyer himself, during the interview with Ms. Dimacali, said, \u201csure,\u201d when she asked if he\u2019d like to dress up as Black Panther.\n\n\u201cFor a white kid to be so open and judge based on the character\u2019s story and the personality and history, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s important,\u201d she said. \u201cBut on the flip side, I think it\u2019s also great to have a black superhero you can identify and connect to.\u201d\n\nThe character\u2019s history is unique. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1966, Black Panther rules as the king of an African technological utopia known as Wakanda. Untouched by European invaders, Wakanda exists apart from the legacies of colonization and racism. Black history and black fantasy are central to the character, and the series has brought on prominent black writers including Ta-Nehisi Coates to deepen its significance over the last 50 years.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

He is completing \u201cRise of the Black Panther,\u201d a six-part comic series for Marvel that traces the character\u2019s early history. He has tried to explain some of that history to his 7-year-old daughter, but without delving too deeply into complex concepts like Western imperialism, which she may struggle to grasp.\n\n\u201cYou want that white kid to be able to think that he can dress up in a Black Panther costume, because, to that kid, there\u2019s no difference between Captain America and Black Panther,\u201d Mr. Narcisse, 45, said. But, he added, it also involves \u201ctrying to explain what is special about T\u2019Challa and Wakanda without racism.

It\u2019s projected to make a record-breaking $165 million over Presidents\u2019 Day weekend and comparisons to last year\u2019s \u201cWonder Woman\u201d bode well for its reception and impact, particularly for black people.\n\n\u201cWhite people have the privilege of not constantly being reminded of their race in the United States, where white is the majority, whereas as a black person you don\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Vittrup said. She believes that parents in general, and white parents in particular, are reluctant to talk about race with young children. When they do, they often miss the chance to talk about inequality, even though research supports the idea that children develop an awareness of race and difference at a very young age.\n\nMs. Vittrup was careful to add that dressing as Black Panther isn\u2019t inherently appropriative or offensive. The character comes from an invented African country, and to wear his mask isn\u2019t quite the same as wearing blackface. However, in a moment where even more black heroes, like Luke Cage and Black Lightning, are finding their way into the limelight, Black Panther\u2019s relationship with the black community and its history creates an opportunity to teach nonblack children about the black experience.\n\n\u201cKids are not colorblind,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of structural inequality in our society, and kids are noticing that.

Even the clothes are an 18th-century version of current POTUS style: basic black suit and fat tie. As for Washington, he stands blank-faced, one arm extended, like a tenor taking a dignified bow.\n\n[Read remarks from the Obamas and the artists. ]\n\nUninflected dignity was the attitude of choice for well over a century, with a few breaks. In an 1836 portrait, Andrew Jackson, a demonstrative bully, sports a floor-length, red-silk-lined Dracula cloak and a kind of topiary bouffant. (A picture of Jackson, one of President Trump\u2019s populist heroes, hangs in the Oval Office.) Abraham Lincoln, seen in several likenesses, is exceptional for looking as if he may actually have weighty matters on his mind. Most of the portraits that precede and follow his are pure P.R.\n\nThis continues well into the 20th century. In a 1980 painting Jimmy Carter trades a black suit for a beige one. How revolutionary is that? And there\u2019s a Casual Fridays vogue: Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both go tieless for it. Under the circumstances, Elaine de Kooning\u2019s 1963 portrait of John F. Kennedy, a fanfare of green and blue strokes, hits like a boost of adrenaline. Rousing too, though not in a good way, is a big head shot image of Bill Clinton by the artist Chuck Close. Using his signature mosaic-like painting technique, Mr. Close turns the 42nd president into a pixelated clown.\n\nMr. Obama has much better luck with his similarly high-profile portraitist. Mr. Wiley, born in Los Angeles in 1977, gained a following in the early 2000s with his crisp, glossy, life-size paintings of young African-American men dressed in hip-hop styles, but depicted in the old-master manner of European royal portraits. More recently he has expanded his repertoire to include female subjects, as well as models from Brazil, India, Nigeria and Senegal, creating the collective image of a global black aristocracy.\n\nIn an imposingly scaled painting \u2014 just over seven feet tall \u2014 the artist presents Mr. Obama dressed in the regulation black suit and an open-necked white shirt, and seated on a vaguely thronelike chair not so different from the one seen in Stuart\u2019s Washington portrait. But art historical references stop there. So do tonal echoes of past portraits. Whereas Mr. Obama\u2019s predecessors are, to the man, shown expressionless and composed, Mr. Obama sits tensely forward, frowning, elbows on his knees, arms crossed, as if listening hard. No smiles, no Mr. Nice Guy. He\u2019s still troubleshooting, still in the game.\n\nVideo\n\nHis engaged and assertive demeanor contradicts \u2014 and cosmetically corrects \u2014 the impression he often made in office of being philosophically detached from what was going on around him. At some level, all portraits are propaganda, political or personal. And what makes this one distinctive is the personal part. Mr. Wiley has set Mr. Obama against \u2014 really embedded him in \u2014 a bower of what looks like ground cover. From the greenery sprout flowers that have symbolic meaning for the sitter. African blue lilies represent Kenya, his father\u2019s birthplace; jasmine stands for Hawaii, where Mr. Obama himself was born; chrysanthemums, the official flower of Chicago, reference the city where his political career began, and where he met his wife.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMrs. Obama\u2019s choice of Ms. Sherald as an artist was an enterprising one. Ms. Sherald, who was born in Columbus, Ga., in 1973 and lives in Baltimore, is just beginning to move into the national spotlight after putting her career on hold for some years to deal with a family health crisis, and one of her own. (She had a heart transplant at 39.) Production-wise, she and Mr. Wiley operate quite differently. He runs the equivalent of a multinational art factory, with assistants churning out work. Ms. Sherald, who until a few years ago made her living waiting tables, oversees a studio staff of one, herself.\n\nAt the same time, they have much in common. Both focused early on African-American portraiture precisely because it is so little represented in Western art history. And both tend to blend fact and fiction. Mr. Wiley, with photo-realistic precision, casts actual people in fantastically heroic roles. (He modifies his heroizing in the case of Mr. Obama, but it\u2019s still there.) Ms. Sherald also starts with realism, but softens and abstracts it. She gives all her figures gray-toned skin \u2014 a color with ambiguous racial associations \u2014 and reduces bodies to geometric forms silhouetted against single-color fields.\n\nShe shows Mrs. Obama sitting against a field of light blue, wearing a spreading gown. The dress design, by Michelle Smith, is eye-teasingly complicated: mostly white interrupted by black Op Art-ish blips and patches of striped color suggestive of African textiles. The shape of the dress, rising pyramidally upward, mountain-like, feels as if it were the real subject of the portrait. Mrs. Obama\u2019s face forms the composition\u2019s peak, but could be almost anyone\u2019s face, like a model\u2019s face in a fashion spread. To be honest, I was anticipating \u2014 hoping for \u2014 a bolder, more incisive image of the strong-voiced person I imagine this former first lady to be.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m wishing, let me mention something more. Mr. Obama\u2019s portrait will be installed, long-term, among those of his presidential peers, in a dedicated space on the second floor. Mrs. Obama\u2019s will hang in a corridor reserved for temporary displays of new acquisitions \u2014 on the first floor. It will stay there until November, after which there\u2019s no set-aside place for it to land.\n\nIf first men have an acknowledged showcase, first women \u2014 ladies or not \u2014 should too. Better, they should all be together, sharing space, offering a welcoming environment to, among others, a future first female president, and creating a lasting monument to #MeToo.", "keywords": ["washington", "black", "fiction", "portraits", "obama", "obamas", "mr", "blend", "wiley", "ms", "sherald", "portrait", "politics", "paint", "fact"], "polarity": 0.07208600786186993, "subjectivity": 0.35921572042261696},

While it is true that compared with Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton lost ground with that segment of the electorate, the clues to a new Democratic majority may be found in the coalition that elected Mr. Northam governor of Virginia, or perhaps more accurately, voted against Mr. Gillespie and his immigrant bashing.\n\nIn Virginia, polling data has made it clear that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 rhetoric backfired among minority voters as well as, crucially, among many whites. Mr. Northam won a majority of white college-educated voters, who made up a larger share of the electorate in 2017 than they did in 2016. Mr. Gillespie matched Mr. Trump with noncollege whites, but their turnout was down. And minority voters in 2017 matched their 2016 electorate share \u2014 for the first time ever there was no drop-off from the presidential to the gubernatorial election. The Democrats also expanded their margin of victory in Virginia from five percentage points in 2016 to nine points in 2017.\n\nBefore the vote in Virginia, pundits on both the right and left were speculating that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s anti-immigrant strategy was working. But in the end, election results and polling data in Virginia proved all that thinking was wrong. While each state has its own demographics and distinct politics, Virginia has voters who span demographic and economic spectrums. Majorities of voters of all races and ethnicities rejected anti-immigrant stereotypes as ugly and wrong.\n\nAccording to an election eve survey of voters by Latino Decisions, Latino voters said that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads made them less enthusiastic about him, by a 45-point margin. But it wasn\u2019t just Latino voters. By a 23-point margin (52 to 29), whites in Virginia also said the MS-13 ads turned them away from Mr. Gillespie, as did African-American and Asian-American voters by larger margins.\n\nData speaks louder than punditry, and our regression analysis of survey data paints a clear picture. Exposure to Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads actually helped drive white college-educated voters away from the Republicans. When we analyzed findings for white independents and Republicans, voters who were aware of the MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Mr. Gillespie\u2019s Democratic opponent. What should be alarming for Republicans is that this effect wasn\u2019t limited to the governor\u2019s race. The Gillespie campaign had coattail effects, but of the wrong stripe. Across all racial groups, those who were aware of Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Democratic candidates for Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates.\n\nThis means that not only is it morally just for Democrats to position themselves as the party that stands against hatred and bigotry and in favor of inclusiveness and opportunity, but it is also a strategically sound position for winning votes. Simultaneously, it sends a clear, welcoming message to Latino, African-American and Asian-American voters, while also winning over enough of the white voters who also oppose immigrant bashing.\n\nThis phenomenon is particularly true of voters who will decide crucial House and Senate races in 2018: people of color and white college-educated voters \u2014 also known as the Democratic base. Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans are clearly gearing up for a similar anti-immigrant effort in 2018. But now the mask has been pulled off. Voters get it. Democrats have an opportunity to speak out strongly against bigotry. And in doing so, they have a path to victory in 2018 and beyond.", "keywords": ["immigration", "virginia", "ms13", "ads", "win", "democrats", "mr", "white", "vote", "gillespies", "voters", "republicans"], "polarity": 0.10965551203646441, "subjectivity": 0.4705427288760622},

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nYet, despite the obvious truth of that statement, we may wonder: What are the moral and political arguments that underwrite the claim that black lives matter? While there is no way to articulate the full scope of those arguments in a single essay, it\u2019s worth considering the philosophical contributions of some of the forerunners of the movement that is our most urgent manifestation of black thought today.\n\nThe end of the Civil War and the subsequent ratification of the 13th Amendment in 1865 legally abolished slavery, but blacks quickly became subject to a displaced form of violence at the hands of white supremacists across the nation who typically used false accusations of sexual assault to justify lynching black men. Police turned a blind eye to these murders, and sometimes actively facilitated them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIda B. Wells, a leading black thinker and journalist in the late-19th and early 20th centuries, and a co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, built a public career documenting lynchings and calling America to account for them. Her arguments extended and amplified those made by Frederick Douglass before her. Douglass\u2019s central claim in his seminal \u201cThe Meaning of July Fourth for the Negro\u201d was that Americans should feel shame for slavery, given their country\u2019s foundational commitment to liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We were failing our own ideals.\n\nWells pointed to the rise of lynching after the fall of slavery as not merely a legal matter to be rectified with new laws. Having fled her hometown to escape threats of her own lynching, Wells used the press to make her moral arguments. She described a nation in the grip of a dark remorse for freeing black Americans from slavery, and condemned white Americans for cruelties that violated their own commitment to the democratic project.\n\nThe horrors that Wells described were a factor in the Great Migration of blacks to the North, which fed the flourishing of black thought and cultural life that gave rise to the Harlem Renaissance. An indication that the Harlem Renaissance was always meant to be a period of radical black philosophy and social change was the name originally coined for the movement: The New Negro. Alain Locke, the Harvard-educated black intellectual who became known as the father of the Harlem Renaissance, envisioned a philosophical position that reinvigorated blacks\u2019 relationship to their culture and that would in turn solidify their status as equal co-participants in our democracy.\n\nA strong theme among some of the luminaries of the time focused on the will of blacks to assert their humanity against racism and to insist on their status as persons owed respect. Among those stars, the poet Langston Hughes was one of the brightest. His \u201cI Too\u201d is a quiet yet insistent poem depicting a black man employed by a white one and his struggle with invisibility. The protagonist resolves to sit at the table with the white folks the next day and show people how beautiful he is and that he, too, is America. The writer Zora Neale Hurston had an equally persistent but at times more playful take on the matter. In her essay \u201cHow It Feels to Be Colored Me,\u201d she wrote, \u201cSometimes, I feel discriminated against, but it does not make me angry. It merely astonishes me. How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company! It\u2019s beyond me.\u201d\n\nThinkers like Hughes and Hurston were involved in the Harlem Renaissance project of presenting a vision of black cultural vitality and worth that would rework the image of black Americans that whites typically relied upon. That stream of thought runs directly into the heart of Black Lives Matter.\n\nAnother valuable and necessary development to come out of the Black Lives Matter movement is the de-emphasizing of black patriarchy and the equal acknowledgment of the suffering of black women and the black L.G.T.B.Q. community. Though sexuality was an avenue of inquiry during the Harlem Renaissance, it was perhaps the mid- to late-20th century poet and theorist Audre Lorde who did the most to make black women\u2019s sexuality a focal point of political and social philosophy.\n\nWhile today \u201cintersectionality\u201d is bandied about as the cutting edge of social research, it was Lorde who in her writing insisted on complicating our view of personal identity by claiming that each of us belongs to multiple identity communities, all of which contribute to our sense of self and our purposes.\n\nShe also showed the broad reach of white supremacy and its effects on black Americans as they located themselves in more nuanced ways in the tapestry of American culture. For her, the primary form taken by resistance to racism was the denial of blunt categories imposed on black Americans, which stifled the possibility of an individual\u2019s full flourishing. Lorde, then, called for a radical form of self-possession whose boundaries were not open to negotiation with a white society.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen people think of Black Lives Matter, they often think of anger feeding forceful protests. Anger is a reasonable response to racial injustice. To be certain, groups like the Black Panthers and thinkers like Malcolm X advised black Americans to get angry and take the doctrine of armed self-defense seriously. Though anger and love are not mutually exclusive emotions, James Baldwin and Martin Luther King Jr. affirmed a view of civic love to pre-empt the need for violence.\n\nKing espoused a form of Kantian regard that prioritized conceiving of every human, racist or not, as owed a kind of love that is grounded in the ideal of universal respect. Baldwin held a slightly different view. He felt black Americans ought to see whites as democratic kin or family, as people with whom blacks would have serious quarrels but also people whom it would be worth keeping close in order to strengthen and bring integrity to the bonds of shared democratic life. These two views of love eschewed violence yet insisted on militancy. While forgiveness and acceptance were hallmarks of King\u2019s and Baldwin\u2019s views, so was an unyielding commitment to self-respect and the demand for social change to institutionalize the idea that blacks were co-creators of the American kingdom.\n\nThinkers like Wells, Hughes, Hurston, Lorde and Baldwin not only anticipated the current Black Lives Matter movement but provided an intellectual blueprint to give depth and integrity to that slogan, so that its meaning transcends the demand to stop police brutality. It is a demand for whites to extend their historical imagination and recognize that the ills of racism are not the result of a few bad police officers or a few out-and-out racists in some far-off corner of America. The problem, rather, is a kind of complicity \u2014 one partaking in the false comfort that America has somehow escaped the trajectory of its racially murderous history. It is necessary that we to see our society today as continuous with that history and not anomalous to it.\n\nBlack thought\u2019s primary contribution to the academy and to American society is the richness and precision with which it describes our worst demons to us, while offering a vision of how we might each save our democracy from the ruin of irrational fear and hatred.", "keywords": ["black", "blacks", "white", "showed", "america", "renaissance", "movement", "harlem", "americans", "lives", "matter"], "polarity": 0.043612258953168, "subjectivity": 0.3973699190419967},

Bell Pottinger may have set back race relations in South Africa by as much as 10 years.\u201d\n\nWithin days of the firm\u2019s removal from the trade association, clients were fleeing. By the end of September, all 250 employees were laid off and Bell Pottinger was finished.\n\nA Unique Client List\n\nLondon is now home to a cluster of P.R. firms catering to foreign governments, raising worries that the city has become \u201cthe global capital of reputation laundering,\u201d as The Evening Standard put it a few years ago. Bell Pottinger established the template of this lucrative niche.\n\nIt was largely the brainchild of Tim Bell, who had earned his reputation, along with a knighthood, helping Margaret Thatcher win three elections. He came to fame with the \u201cLabour isn\u2019t working\u201d ads that helped the Conservative Party gain control of Parliament in the 1979 general election. Colleagues actually coined the phrase, and he talked Mrs. Thatcher into adopting it.\n\n\u201cThere were many conversations in which she shouted at me and told me I was an idiot,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI just had to stand my ground and say, \u2018I know what I\u2019m doing.\u2019\u201d\n\nNow 77, Mr. Bell appears to have stepped directly out of an Evelyn Waugh novel with everything but a smoking jacket. Gray haired with an owlish pair of black glasses, he speaks with jaunty indifference and ingratiating candor, a combination that always made the tsk-tskers who disapproved of his client list sound unworldly and na\u00efve.\n\n\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Breaking News Emails Sign up to receive an email from The New York Times as soon as important news breaks around the world.

When the pair started working together in the mid-80s, Mr. Bell was sought after by political leaders and corporations who wanted some of the communications magic he had provided to Mrs. Thatcher.\n\nBell Pottinger quickly had hundreds of clients, a few of them infamous. Mr. Bell attributes his ability to work with virtually anyone to innate optimism.\n\n\u201cI see the good in people,\u201d he said.\n\nThis included Chile\u2019s former dictator Augusto Pinochet. Mr. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain in 1998 as part of an effort to deport him to Spain, where he had been indicted on a charge of torturing Spanish citizens.\n\nAfter two years of legal and political wrangling, Mr. Bell and his allies prevailed when Mr. Pinochet was authorized to freely return to Chile.\n\nBell Pottinger was hardly the only British outfit working for rogues and despots, as well as publicly traded companies, nor was it the largest or most profitable. But it had a buccaneering spirit that made it the firm of choice for a wide variety of missions.\n\n\n\nDuring the war in Iraq, Bell Pottinger had a contract with the Pentagon to produce propaganda for the United States military. This included scripts in Arabic for a soap opera that aired in the country, said Mr. Bell.\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen the company\u2019s client list did not generate news, its methods did. In 2011, it was caught boasting about its skills in the dark arts of search engine manipulation to people it thought were potential clients.\n\nIn fact, they were undercover members of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit organization that works with a variety of media. Posing as executives from the made-up Azimov Group, these \u201crepresentatives\u201d said the company had ties to the Uzbekistan regime, which has been criticized for repression and for using forced child labor during its cotton harvest.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Azimov executives said they worried about blowback.\n\nFret not, said Tim Collins, a Bell Pottinger managing director, per transcripts published by The Independent, a British newspaper. After the company applied its tech wizardry, \u201cYou get to the point where even if they type in \u2018Uzbek child labour\u2019 or \u2018Uzbek human rights violation,\u2019 some of the first results that come up are sites talking about what you guys are doing to address and improve that, not just the critical voices saying how terrible this all is.\u201d\n\nMr. Bell never challenged the transcripts, but he denounced the sting at the time as an \u201cunethical, underhand deception to manufacture a story where none exists.\u201d\n\nBeginning of the End\n\nBell Pottinger\u2019s slide into oblivion began with a visit to the Guptas in January 2016. Mr. Bell, who had worked in South Africa for years, said he had no idea what the brothers wanted, but he and several colleagues flew to Johannesburg to find out.\n\n\u201cWe went to this bloody great mansion, which seemed to be their headquarters,\u201d Mr. Bell recalled. \u201cGreat big room, huge sofas all over the place. Servants. Appalling, all of it.\u201d\n\nThe family already had a fortune, Tony Gupta told the small entourage. Now, he and his brothers wanted to help poor blacks. To that end, they wanted a P.R. campaign that pushed the idea of economic emancipation.\n\n\u201cSo we went back to London and wrote a strategy,\u201d said Mr. Bell. \u201cTown hall meetings, marching in the street, that kind of thing. Draw attention to the economic imbalance, then tell people they should protest and demand change.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe company drafted a two-page proposal, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times. Among its recommendations was \u201ca non-party political narrative around the existence of economic apartheid\u201d that Bell Pottinger would package \u201cinto speeches, news releases, website content, videos/broadcast content, slogans and other material required.\u201d\n\nSoon, the Guptas said that their company needed communications help, too. Most South Africans, the Guptas maintained, had an inflated notion of how much of the family\u2019s revenue came from government contracts, which harmed their interests, several Bell Pottinger employees recalled.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe corporate campaign was the first sign that altruism had little to do with the \u00a3100,000 a month that Bell Pottinger would earn during what was initially a three-month project. The second was the anger of the company\u2019s other South Africa clients when they learned of the arrangement.\n\nThe billionaire Johann Rupert was aghast to suddenly find himself one of the most prominent examples of \u201cwhite monopoly capital.\u201d He texted Mr. Bell and asked how his P.R. firm could also be working for a family that was bashing him. Mr. Bell, by his own account, quickly lost enthusiasm for the Gupta project.\n\n\u201cIt was altogether smelly,\u201d he said of the racial element of the work. But he quickly added that ethics were not the issue. If enough South African clients quit Bell Pottinger, he reasoned, the losses would outweigh the Guptas\u2019s checks. \u201cI was saying it\u2019s not a commercially sensible thing to do.\u201d\n\nBut by the end of March, only one client \u2014 the banking and asset management company Investec \u2014 had severed ties with the P.R. firm. After that, Bell Pottinger tried to find middle ground by signing a new contract with the Guptas, this time with a codicil literally called an anti-embarrassment clause. It allowed the firm to terminate the account \u201cwithout notice\u201d if the brothers brought discredit to the business.\n\nMr. Bell said he soon resolved to quit the company because he felt undermined and undervalued by Mr. Henderson. \u201cHe made my life a misery from start to finish,\u201d said Mr. Bell, speaking one recent afternoon in the living room of his home near London\u2019s Sloane Square. After negotiating a \u00a33.5 million exit package, Mr. Bell resigned in August 2016.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor his part, Mr. Henderson declined in a recent interview to indulge in the put-downs that come so easily to his antagonist. Seated at a conference table in temporary offices in Mayfair, where he is starting a new P.R. firm, he said Bell Pottinger\u2019s dissolution was too recent to discuss.\n\n\u201cI have huge empathy for all those impacted,\u201d he said, \u201cand believe now is not the appropriate time to go into details.\u201d\n\nInflaming Tensions\n\nThe P.R. campaign in South Africa, which started in 2016, was intended to raise the temperature of race relations. And it worked.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore than 100 fake Twitter accounts were created, all of them retweeting content from other Twitter accounts with names like @economycapture, according to media reports. Popular hashtags included #WhiteMonopolyCapital and #RespectGuptas. The campaign involved some 220,000 tweets.\n\nThere were also attack website with names like WMC Leaks and WMC Scams. Another part of this ecosystem were mainstream media outlets owned by the Guptas, like ANN7, a 24-hour news channel, and The New Age, a daily newspaper.\n\nAs the campaign spread, leaders at groups like the A.N.C. Youth League gave inflammatory speeches, decrying the \u201cstranglehold\u201d that rich whites had on the economy. Leaked emails would later show that the groups received media training, and in some cases funds, from Oakbay.\n\nAn atmosphere of menace slowly pervaded the country. In July 2016, the police minister announced the creation of a task force to investigate the murder of more than a dozen political figures. In the run-up to municipal elections that year, Mr. Zuma described the Democratic Alliance, the A.N.C.\u2019s main rival, as a \u201cwhite party,\u201d adding that it could not \u201crun this country no matter how they cover up by getting a few black stooges.\u201d\n\nNew and radical groups like Black First Land First sprang up, holding public rallies to fulminate against whites. At one, in May 2016, a pastor named Xola Skosana told the crowd, \u201cWe have been wounded beyond measure. Let us find the pillars and bring the house down. Black people must be avenged.\u201d\n\nFor the first time in years, whites felt a rising sense of personal danger. Nicholas Wolpe, a white South African whose father was a pioneer of the anti-apartheid movement, remembers a palpable anxiety. \u201cThere was a shift toward intolerance,\u201d he said. \u201cGradually, the debate about white monopoly capital was everywhere and the people talking about it were loud and belligerent. It struck a nerve.\u201d\n\nIn a related and surreptitious campaign, the Guptas were being recast as warmhearted people eager to help the downtrodden. A website connected to Black First Land First ran editorials defending the brothers, suggesting in one that they should be \u201cpraised for saving jobs.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["met", "bell", "pr", "pottinger", "despots", "mr", "firm", "main", "end", "rogues", "company", "south", "campaign", "guptas", "reading", "africa"], "polarity": 0.05728090899659527, "subjectivity": 0.3829289628309236}
