In 1983, Paule Marshall, best known for her novel \u201cBrown Girl, Brownstones,\u201d reflected on how observing her mother\u2019s relationship to language inspired her career. An excerpt follows.\n\nI grew up among poets. Now they didn\u2019t look like poets \u2014 whatever that breed is supposed to look like. Nothing about them suggested that poetry was their calling. They were just a group of ordinary housewives and mothers, my mother included, who dressed in a way (shapeless housedresses, dowdy felt hats and long, dark, solemn coats) that made it impossible for me to imagine they had ever been young.\n\nNor did they do what poets were supposed to do \u2014 spend their days in an attic room writing verses. Several mornings a week these unknown bards would put an apron and a pair of old house shoes in a shopping bag and take the train or streetcar from our section of Brooklyn out to Flatbush. There, those who didn\u2019t have steady jobs would wait on certain designated corners for the white housewives in the neighborhood to come along and bargain with them over pay for a day\u2019s work cleaning their houses. Later, armed with the few dollars they had earned, which in their vocabulary became \u201ca few raw-mouth pennies,\u201d they made their way back to our neighborhood, where they would sometimes stop off to have a cup of tea or cocoa together before going home to cook dinner for their husbands and children.\n\nThere was no way for me to understand it at the time, but the talk that filled the kitchen those afternoons was highly functional. It served as therapy, the cheapest kind available to my mother and her friends. It restored them to a sense of themselves and reaffirmed their self-worth. Through language they were able to overcome the humiliations of the work day. Confronted by a world they could not encompass, they took refuge in language.\n\nThey taught me my first lessons in the narrative art. They trained my ear. They set a standard of excellence. This is why the best of my work must be attributed to them; it stands as testimony to the rich legacy of language and culture they so freely passed on to me in the wordshop of the kitchen.", "keywords": ["language", "work", "notes", "way", "ordinary", "mother", "look", "book", "poets", "neighborhood", "archives", "supposed", "review", "mothers"], "polarity": 0.106871921182266, "subjectivity": 0.42137110016420365},

It\u2019s hard to resist this self-proclaimed \u201cgeriatric starlet.\u201d With her owlish glasses, loud prints and necklaces upon necklaces, even in her 90s, Apfel is a fashion icon who combines a memoir with photos of the vibrant content of her closets. HOW TO SLAY By Constance C. R. White. (Rizzoli, $55.) White explores the rich history of African-American style and taste, from Josephine Baker and Diana Ross to Rihanna and Lupita Nyong\u2019o.

So I escaped into the past, reading NELLIE BLY, an acclaimed 1994 biography by Brooke Kroeger, and then Bly\u2019s actual stories, filled with stunts and derring-do. Self-trained, Bly was not a master craftswoman: Her writing could flirt both with tedium and turgidity. Some stories seemed more truthy than truthful. But what stories! By the time she turned 26, Bly had gone undercover as a mental patient in New York, exposed corruption in the state capital and traveled the world in 72 days, a great feat at the time. She changed that world in small ways and opened the door for other women to follow.

Le Guin\n\n215 pp. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. $22.\n\nPhoto\n\nLe Guin (who died in January) has written before about the genre for which she is best known, and explains herein that \u201cthe fantastic tale may suspend the laws of physics \u2026 but it carries its revolt against reality no further.\u201d That is, the author of fantasy must have a sharp understanding of emotional, social and political realities. Such intelligence gleams in these essays, culled from several years of blog posts. Le Guin claims the form \u201csounds like a sodden tree trunk in a bog\u201d and calls her own attempts \u201cmore trivially personal\u201d than those that inspired her. But the trivially personal is a chief pleasure of this collection, which uses its firm footing in the concrete world to ponder an eclectic array of topics. The pages sparkle with lines that make a reader glance up, searching for an available ear with which to share them.\n\n\u201cOld age is for anybody who gets there,\u201d Le Guin asserts in a scorching section about aging, while two others describe the travails of her cat, Pard, with less irony than J. R. Ackerley\u2019s memoir of his dog, Tulip, but no less charm. Other sections meander from the nature of belief, Homer and the obsolete nature of the Great American Novel to domestic studies like the relocation of a rattlesnake from her own yard to that of the millionaire down the street.\n\nThe strongest essays narrow themselves to Le Guin\u2019s fervent obsession with language. In \u201cHaving My Cake,\u201d a contemplation of her difficulty understanding proverbs becomes a syntax-shuffling close reading of the one in the title. This linguistic gnawing is one of the book\u2019s great delights. \u201cWords fascinate me,\u201d she explains, \u201cthe way box elder beetles fascinate my friend Pard,\u201d who will \u201cstare unmoving for 10 minutes at the unattainable light fixture in which a beetle is visible as a tiny moving silhouette.\u201d Images as simple and striking as this or the \u201csmall but violent\u201d LED lights on a Christmas tree become grand observations on the nature of writing and living. \u201cWords are my skein of yarn, my lump of wet clay, my block of uncarved wood,\u201d she explains, and then quietly astounds us with the carving.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI WROTE THIS BOOK BECAUSE I LOVE YOU\n\nEssays\n\nBy Tim Kreider\n\n206 pp. Simon & Schuster. $26.\n\nPhoto\n\nKreider, a political cartoonist and essayist, has indeed written this book because he loves you. Or rather, because he has loved some women and one cat, and learned a few things along the way. In a style reminiscent of Orwell, E. B. White and David Sedaris, an affable hero gamely bumbles through adventures rich with moments of fleeting profundity and moral reckoning. He follows a manic circus tutor on a train to Mexico, falls for a fellow cartoonist amid the early aughts\u2019 war on terror and trysts with a politically enlightened prostitute. These stories entertain, though I prefer him being wittily deprecated by his female companions to his drawing binaries between \u201c\u2018Type A\u2019: smart, pretty, sane, moral girls with glasses who tended to work for nonprofits or write\u201d and \u201cbawdy dominatrices\u201d (to be fair, this reviewer is a Type A, former bawdy dominatrix who writes).

Describing the emotional rush of an evening spent colluding and conjoining, she sounds as if she has a new crush: \u201cI related to every single thing she said,\u201d Schaefer tells us, reporting that they discussed \u201cthings I don\u2019t typically share with someone I\u2019m just sitting down with for the first time.\u201d She gushes to her mother via text the next day: \u201cI have a new best friend. \u2026 I love her.\u201d\n\nIn a year that has been described as a women\u2019s renaissance, female friendship feels particularly worthy of contemplation. As professional opportunities broaden and cultural attitudes shift, competition between women has given way to allyship. Through the return of women\u2019s social organizations and the formalization of whisper networks, female solidarity is more pervasive than ever, a byproduct of girl power and the cumulation of years of quiet rebellion.\n\n\u201cWomen are stepping up together, loudly and publicly,\u201d writes Schaefer, a journalist whose subjects have ranged from the Korean beauty industry to the occult. It seems the world is finally recognizing the power of female connection, which the poet Adrienne Rich once described as \u201cthe most feared, the most problematic and the most potentially transforming force on the planet.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat girl hasn\u2019t buzzed with the rare thrill of a new friendship? It offers a shared hiding place and a secret understanding outside the reach of men, parents, employers; someone who hates everything you hate, who takes on your causes as her own; someone who, after leaving you at the end of the night, cares that you get home safely.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn many of our lives, friendships matter as much as romantic relationships. Friends are our soul mates \u2014 and, more practically, our emergency contacts. Why then, Schaefer asks, is friendship as an institution not afforded the same benefits and privileges as marriage? It\u2019s a position that has been gaining steam in the legal community, among advocates of so-called friendship law like Rachel Moran, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has argued that platonic bonds ought to matter \u201cnot only in my own intimate life, but in the eyes of the law.\u201d", "keywords": ["text", "female", "womens", "power", "friendship", "girl", "squads", "romantic", "potential", "action", "law", "matter", "schaefer"], "polarity": 0.14661102786102786, "subjectivity": 0.47259892884892873},

Alizadeh raps, \u201cLet me scream, I\u2019m tired of silence,\u201d while lifting a Western-style wedding veil. Beneath it her face is made up to look as if she\u2019s been beaten: swollen eyes and bruised jaw. It\u2019s a powerful image, one that Bagieu doesn\u2019t hesitate to draw into the strip.\n\nVideo\n\nAnd Bagieu\u2019s drawings are wonderful. Though sometimes spare, with minimal effort spent on backgrounds, her line manages to flow and skate through 29 stories of remarkable women. These drawings can act. They are alive with gestural attitude. They move, dance, struggle, fight back, fall in love, resist and wonder at the world. Some ham it up. Some suffer terrible abuse. To her credit, Bagieu doesn\u2019t back away from drawing the marks of violence on their faces and their bodies, which may come as a surprise to those who are expecting a rah-rah young adult girl-power sort of read.\n\nBagieu calls these comics \u201cbroad stroke portraits,\u201d and explains the sometimes too breezy storytelling this way: \u201cThis book is by no means a thorough scholarly work; rather, it\u2019s one woman\u2019s tribute \u2014 my homage to the full, daring lives they lead, often against great odds.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAll of her stories follow a similar pattern. Almost every page has nine frames and each biography begins with a portrait drawn in a beribboned oval template. They cover the birth, life and death of each of her subjects in a way that can feel a bit formulaic, but this seems to have more to do with the fact that the English translation is typeset rather than in Bagieu\u2019s handwriting.\n\nIn the original version of these strips, which are luckily available in French on the Le Monde website, where they originally appeared, the difference is instantly apparent. The nature of handwriting gives the portraits a more personal \u201cvoice.\u201d It feels as if Bagieu herself is telling you these stories. They lose their Wikipedia tone and become more intimate, more like that of a cool fairy godmother recounting tales you need to hear without too much worry about sources, originality or historical accuracy. Her handwriting preserves her passion, along with clear intent to both delight and embolden the reader.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt\u2019s painful to see this crucial part of her work replaced with type. It changes everything about how the stories are received. The reading speed is altered. The tone and the visual relationship between the text and the drawing just isn\u2019t there. It\u2019s her handwriting that makes these panels spring to life. Panels that seemed awkwardly composed suddenly become elegant and beautifully balanced. It\u2019s hard for people to understand the importance of a cartoonist\u2019s handwriting. In the same way melody transforms lyrics, handwriting transforms words and can have a profound impact on how the story is received and understood.\n\nSadly, nearly every scrap of Bagieu\u2019s lovely handwriting has been scrubbed and replaced in this translation, even when completely unnecessary. The only clue to this \u201cvoice\u201d is a rare lettered sign here and there, and her name, \u201cP\u00e9n\u00e9lope,\u201d sweetly signed at the end of each strip.\n\nThese \u201crebel ladies\u201d come from all over the world (though surprisingly over a third of them are American). They also come from all points in time, like Agnodice, whom Bagieu presents as a gutsy gynecologist from ancient Greece, to the astronaut Mae Jemison (the one with the tight Afro), to the \u201cAnimal Whisperer\u201d Temple Grandin and the \u201cLover of Modern Art\u201d Peggy Guggenheim (she\u2019s the one with the wild sunglasses). Bagieu includes sets of siblings, like the Wiggins sisters, who were forced by their father to form a rock band called \u201cThe Shaggs,\u201d and \u201cLas Mariposas,\u201d the Dominican Republic\u2019s Mirabel sisters, who were murdered during the Trujillo regime in 1960. And she profiles too one of my favorite women, Frances Glessner Lee, who helped crime scene investigators hone their craft by creating intensely accurate miniature replicas of rooms where murders took place.\n\nBagieu has dedicated this book to her own daughters, and I kept that in mind as I read it. When I imagine her telling these stories to them, I\u2019m reminded of something my grandmother would say when she told me these kinds of tales. \u201cOf course it is only a story my dear. But it is true!\u201d Bagieu\u2019s pen transforms these true stories into something that has the tone of a personalized fairy tale.

Some of Lazarin\u2019s stories \u2014 not coincidentally, my favorites \u2014 show women pinging furiously off one another instead of their boyfriends, husbands and fathers, gathering incremental surges of strength and autonomy and rage, of unspoken power. In \u201cThe Holographic Soul,\u201d two young sisters playact a psychic guessing game, then try to actually access their powers, longing for a presence to manifest itself and give them something solid on which to pin their anxieties. The two teenage friends in \u201cGone\u201d keep a list of real-life dead girls, sharing their fear as puberty descends. (\u201cGirls are taught to be discreet,\u201d Lazarin writes in a later story. \u201cBoys, who shout their own terror, make a mess of it, take you down with them.\u201d)\n\nPhoto\n\nIt\u2019s easy to anticipate criticism of \u201cBack Talk\u201d and its quietly realist, \u201cliterary\u201d writing. It won\u2019t help to note that Lazarin\u2019s characters are educated and middle- to upper-class, that her stories are often set in New York and Paris. They are, certainly, beautifully crafted. I loathe the word \u201cpolished\u201d in the context of prose. It\u2019s too clinical, implying that the work was dull before the author intentionally spruced it up. So I\u2019d prefer to say that the sentences in these stories are living and seamless, as if Lazarin had run her hand over them until they became smooth and gleaming with the evidence of her touch. Yet they are not without viscera; sublimated rage fills the crevices between them.\n\nLazarin\u2019s style succeeds in part because the stakes for her characters are wide-ranging, because the implications of their actions ripple outward. In \u201cBack Talk,\u201d the theme of internalized misogyny is, to be quite blunt, terrifying. It\u2019s all the scarier in that it\u2019s so quietly and accurately rendered: These women aren\u2019t running screaming through the night, fleeing to convents, joining all-female cults or driving off into the desert without looking back.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn \u201cSpider Legs,\u201d the teenage narrator goes to Paris to visit her mother, who is writing a book about St. Agnes. Long divorced from the girl\u2019s father, she has chosen as her subject this woman of early Christian Rome, honored by the church for spurning the marriage proposals that would have spared her from suffering and martyrdom. \u201cFor that, she was tortured, shamed, killed, of course,\u201d the narrator\u2019s mother tells her with a wry smile. \u201cNo sense of self-preservation, those saints.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Although Lazarin\u2019s work has the tone and style of traditional mainstream short fiction, it joins a growing canon of quietly realist stories that establish women\u2019s experiences as worthy of literary attention. And not just women\u2019s experiences: These stories also explore the exhausting, slow poison of masculine power, the grind of the patriarchy on even the most privileged of women, the subtle ways in which men have trained women to minimize themselves.\n\nThe hunger for these types of stories is powerful. How else to explain the ferocious explosion of emotion aroused by Kristen Roupenian\u2019s New Yorker story \u201cCat Person\u201d? It shared many qualities with Lazarin\u2019s work \u2014 quiet, literary, realist \u2014 but it made a particular generation of women feel as if they were about to crawl out of their skin, as if they suddenly remembered how bad things had been, how bad they could be, how bad they could get.\n\nIn \u201cAmerican Men in Paris I Did Not Love,\u201d Lazarin\u2019s narrator finds herself in the presence of an insufferable pedant who is probably married and certainly has designs on her. \u201cWe spend four hours together,\u201d she notes flatly, \u201cbefore I remember that I can just get up and go.\u201d And so these stories hand their warnings to us: Don\u2019t be pleasant or easy to teach.

The numerous heroines named in its pages, many of whom come and go with only a brief mention, challenge the reader to keep track. Yet their very multitude underscores Fara\u2019s underlying argument that there is nothing unusual about a feminine engagement with science. The love of botany, the passion for chemistry, the fascination with geology or cosmology is just as likely to animate a girl\u2019s mind as a boy\u2019s. If only her parents, her circumstances and the cultural norms of her country will answer her interest with education and opportunity, any girl may aspire to a lab of her own.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor all Fara\u2019s erudition and scholarship, not to mention her description of herself as a \u201cpernickety academic\u201d at Clare College, Cambridge, she writes without a trace of stuffiness. She also avoids whining about chances missed or credit denied. With the same refreshing approach to perceived injustice that she displayed in earlier books like \u201cPandora\u2019s Breeches\u201d and \u201cScience: A Four Thousand Year History,\u201d Fara bends her talents to a sprightly telling of what happened: \u201cAt Imperial College London, during the First World War, Muriel Baker \u2014 wife of the professor of inorganic chemistry \u2014 was isolated at home in a small laboratory where she experimented on using stockings stuffed with cotton wool to absorb poisonous gases.\u201d\n\nAmong the women Fara singles out for chapter-length treatment, Dr. Isabel Emslie Hutton led a particularly eventful life. \u201cTaught by her parents to give away all but one of her Christmas presents on New Year\u2019s Day, she committed herself to medicine at the age of 17, renouncing with the dedication of a nun all thoughts of marriage.\u201d Eventually she did marry Maj. Thomas Hutton, but not before working as a pathologist in a Scottish mental hospital, carrying out research into chemical tests for syphilis, selling experimental guinea pigs to laboratories throughout Scotland and seeing in the outbreak of World War I the opportunity to practice surgery, \u201cher favorite specialty but one normally reserved for men.\u201d\n\nUpon arrival in Salonika in October 1915, Emslie and her female colleagues \u201cbuilt incinerators, dug latrines, erected tents, installed X-ray equipment and set up a dispensary in a disused silkworm factory.\u201d She operated on wounded soldiers in a wooden hut.\n\nMilitary invasions and outbreaks of malaria kept Emslie moving from one field hospital to another \u2014 even serving as a commanding officer \u2014 all the way until the end of the war. Even then she stayed on in the region for two more years to treat civilian surgical patients in Serbia and children in Sebastopol.\n\nDespite Emslie\u2019s distinguished war record, her marriage in 1921 disqualified her from future employment as a surgeon in Britain. Resuming a prior interest, she served three decades as honorary consultant psychiatrist at the British Hospital for Mental and Nervous Disorders in Camden, \u201cplaying a key role in the introduction of psychoanalysis to Britain.\u201d At the same time she campaigned for equal pay for women doctors and helped women achieve international pilot\u2019s licenses by demonstrating that they were not \u201cincapable of flying during periods and pregnancies.\u201d When her husband was posted to India she gave up her own career to follow him. \u201cTrapped there during the Second World War,\u201d Isabel Emslie Hutton became director of the Indian Red Cross.\n\n\u201cA Lab of One\u2019s Own,\u201d with its title salute to Virginia Woolf, is primarily an English war story. \u201cBroad Band,\u201d in contrast, mostly takes place in the United States of the 1940s through the 1990s, and is peopled predominantly with all-American girls wanting, as Time magazine once quipped, \u201ca ROM of their own.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe author, Claire L.

An insightful, intelligent observer, she speaks fluent tech lingo, has written about science and sci-fi for the likes of Vice and Wired, and also sings in a pop group.\n\n\u201cWhen we say the words \u2018internet\u2019 and \u2018web,\u2019\u201d Evans writes, \u201cwe often mean the same thing: the force, larger than nature, that emanates from our screens.\u201d But the internet predates the web by decades. It harks back to the time when folks \u201cdialed directly into each other\u2019s machines and into host computers to exchange files and post messages\u201d in text-only format. \u201cMany of these ad hoc networks interacted with, and eventually coalesced with, the infrastructure of the internet,\u201d a map of which today \u201cis a tensile, crazy, fractal thing\u201d akin to \u201ca beating heart, a web of synapses, a supernova.\u201d The World Wide Web sits atop the internet, functioning as \u201ca network of interconnected visual pages built in a shared language called HTML \u2026 structured pages of text, images and video dotted with clickable links connecting individual points to one another.

When Radia Perlman, for example, enrolled in her first programming course as a high school student in the 1960s (and many more courses later as an odd-woman-out at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology), she discovered that her classmates had been dismantling radios and other electronics from a tender age. \u201cI never took anything apart,\u201d she told Evans. \u201cI would have assumed I would break it or get electrocuted.\u201d Nevertheless, Evans reports, Perlman invented a protocol for moving information that is now fundamental to the way computers are networked. \u201cHer work might be invisible to the everyday user, but it\u2019s invisible in the way that laws are invisible or the rules of traffic in a busy city are invisible: It directs the flow of information at a layer beyond our conscious awareness.\u201d\n\nSuch contributions embolden Evans to declare, with emphasis: \u201cEven when women were invisible, it never means they weren\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nIt is tempting to think these unsung female presences of the past paved the way for today\u2019s women scientists. In fact they did not. They filled particular niches that opened briefly before closing again, leaving scant evidence, let alone a path to follow. Most people struggle to name even one woman scientist (usually Marie Curie).\n\nBoth \u201cA Lab of One\u2019s Own\u201d and \u201cBroad Band\u201d \u2014 along with numerous other recent titles like \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d by Margot Lee Shetterly \u2014 provide much needed perspective, along with presumed-absent foremothers and role models.

She was 38 weeks pregnant at the interview. \u201cBoy, are you fat,\u201d Whedon said. (His producer followed up with, \u201cShould I put down a tarp?\u201d) She didn\u2019t get the job.\n\nPhoto\n\nIf the sprinkling of sociological terms like \u201cstereotype threat\u201d sounds familiar, it\u2019s because Scovell collaborated with Sheryl Sandberg on her study-laden blockbuster, \u201cLean In.\u201d Sandberg, the Facebook executive, provides the TED Talk-ready foreword to \u201cJust the Funny Parts,\u201d writing that \u201cwhoever said feminists weren\u2019t funny never met Nell.\u201d (At her own mother\u2019s funeral, Scovell, one of five siblings, held up an envelope and announced that it contained \u201cthe name of mom\u2019s favorite child.\u201d) A career in the entertainment industry \u2014 scaled like a jungle gym, not a ladder \u2014 meant Scovell lived \u201cLean In\u201d long before she wrote it, Sandberg says. \u201cJust the Funny Parts\u201d is a record of her scramble, retrofitted with post-\u201cLean In\u201d indignation. (She took Shandling\u2019s words as a compliment at first.)\n\nThe bar for contemporary women-in-comedy books was set in 2011 with Tina Fey\u2019s \u201cBossypants,\u201d which managed advice that was both hilarious and accurate \u2014 no pigtails or tube tops at the office, no diet foods in meetings and cry at work if you must because \u201cit terrifies everyone.\u201d Scovell\u2019s lessons are less jokey and more emotionally bare; she even confesses a few things that our feminist foremothers have taught us to keep buttoned up \u2014 like the lines that she crossed, too \u2014 which feels freeing. Over all, though, \u201cJust the Funny Parts\u201d functions best not when Scovell is recounting some backstage encounter on \u201cThe Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\u201d or \u201cNewhart\u201d but when she\u2019s rankled. My first laugh came on Page 58, when Scovell, her contributions on a show once again ignored, asks a female co-worker: \u201cAm I corporeal? You can see and hear me, right?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGender aside, her comedy bona fides are solid: Scovell is from a large, neurotic, bookish, mercilessly honest \u2014 though loving \u2014 Jewish family in Massachusetts. She went to Harvard and wrote for Spy magazine. With a few biographical tweaks, she could be Conan O\u2019Brien. (The two intersected as writers on a short-lived \u201980s talk show.) In typical overachiever fashion, even her failures \u2014 Scovell writes that she was too full of self-doubt to apply for The Harvard Lampoon \u2014 led her somewhere: She became a sportswriter for The Boston Globe, then moved to New York and got a staff job at Vanity Fair. But Scovell soon realized that her high-concept style was better suited for TV. \u201cWriting for TV made way more sense than writing for magazines,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd by sense, I mean money.\u201d\n\nFor aspiring writers, the book has just enough practical advice on story pitches and script editing to qualify as a how-to. \u201cWhen I write, I feel like an optometrist, constantly flipping between lenses and asking: \u2018Is this better? Is this?\u2019 Slowly, the work comes into focus,\u201d she explains. An appendix lists all of her jobs, from Lifetime movies to \u201cNCIS,\u201d and, more bracingly for those starting out, the dozens of scripts unproduced over her 30-year career. Along the way, she married an architect and had two sons, and she is brisk about the fact that her husband\u2019s staying at home with the boys \u2014 carting them around to sets as she wrote, produced and directed \u2014 is what made her employable.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn her 40s and beyond, female executives kept her afloat, she says. Scovell built up a deep network of friends and allies, though strikingly, even in the photos of her gang, she is usually the only woman. The book is laid out like the old joke about the arc of a Hollywood career: Part 1: \u201cWho is Nell Scovell?\u201d Part 2: \u201cGet me Nell Scovell!\u201d Part 3: \u201cGet me a younger, cheaper Nell Scovell!\u201d And finally: \u201cWho is Nell Scovell?\u201d\n\nJust as she is getting to that last stage, however, she meets Sandberg, whose spirit infuses this book: in the references to studies about how men are perceived as confident while women are taught to deflect credit, or in the anecdotes about how Scovell is judged on her presumed emotions rather than her actual abilities. When the two women worked together on \u201cLean In,\u201d Scovell was overjoyed to find an outlet for her frustration \u2014 finally, here was data to back up her sense of inequity! \u2014 and for the reader, that emotional shift comes not a moment too soon, as one thing that\u2019s sacrificed in her litany of miscreants is a larger sense of why she loves or even wants a career in entertainment anymore. \u201cRunning a show is like being beaten to death with your own dream,\u201d a producer she worked with on the series she created, \u201cSabrina the Teenage Witch,\u201d says.\n\nThere are career high points, too; I would have gladly read another chapter on the feminist platform presented by \u201cMurphy Brown.\u201d But through connections made at Facebook, \u201cLean In\u201d brings an even more rarefied opportunity: writing jokes for President Obama. Finally, the payoff! Scovell is understandably giddy at crafting one-liners for the White House Correspondents Dinner, to be delivered by the leader of the free world \u2014 a man who just happens to know how to land a punch line.\n\nThere\u2019s no time to wallow, now, in that era\u2019s ending; there\u2019s too much to fix. Though no doubt Scovell would have had it otherwise, the fact that \u201cJust the Funny Parts\u201d is landing at such a charged moment \u2014 when women are exquisitely, bruisingly fed up \u2014 may be a stroke of luck. In her introduction, Scovell does joke about calling the book \u201cJust the Angry and Bitter Parts,\u201d but says she hoped not to outright discourage young writers. Besides, she adds, \u201cthat would be an eight-volume set.\u201d", "keywords": ["parts", "writing", "nell", "funny", "comedy", "career", "insults", "lean", "book", "comeons", "takedowns", "write", "sandberg", "sense", "scovell", "woman"], "polarity": 0.19041092745638194, "subjectivity": 0.5106305635201738},

MacKinnon and Her Book \u2018Sexual Harassment of Working Women\u2019                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/books/review/metoo-workplace-sexual-harassment-catharine-mackinnon.html", "text": "Although the ritual itself has an incalculably long history, the term \u201csexual harassment\u201d has only been around since the mid-1970s, when activists at Cornell University coined it during a consciousness-raising session. It was MacKinnon\u2019s book, though dense and academic, that brought the idea broader attention, charting a course for the legal system to more effectively handle instances of harassment as cases of sex discrimination, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. As far back as the 19th century, women were occasionally able to reap monetary damages through the courts if men touched them inappropriately in public, but tort law was an inadequate means of addressing harassment claims, MacKinnon believed, because it personalized injuries that were inflicted socially and ecumenically.\n\nLawyers who had tried to apply the civil rights statute to these claims had largely failed, in part because courts struggled to process what was essentially discriminatory about a practice that could theoretically victimize anyone: How could you ever know that a woman was subject to harassment because she was a woman, rather than, say, an individual who happened to be female? MacKinnon\u2019s approach was rooted in the theory that sexual harassment realized and reiterated women\u2019s inequality, that it locked women into a kind of dependence and failure.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIt was not until seven years after the arrival of MacKinnon\u2019s book, though, that the Supreme Court recognized sexual harassment as a Title VII violation. The case was Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson and it had little nuance. In it a bank teller had charged that a company vice president had coerced her into having sex with him repeatedly, that he had touched her in public and raped her. Here the court ruled unanimously that harassment resulting in a hostile work environment was discriminatory and unlawful.\n\nIn a recent essay in The New York Times, MacKinnon celebrated the #MeToo movement, acknowledging that it was able to achieve what sexual harassment law, despite its sporadic victories, could not: a unified movement against an intractable brand of predation. Accusers were suddenly believed. Why the revolution finally got the reception it deserved has still not entirely been sorted out, but it seems clear that a war waged from the vantage point of legal theory was bound to have a harder time than a war waged from the modern media.\n\nThe 1970s and \u201980s witnessed various efforts to expose and address the dark and dangerous habits of American intimacy. Movements against domestic violence and child abuse, for example, had meaningful allies in popular culture. In 1984, \u201cThe Burning Bed,\u201d a television movie based on the true story of a Michigan housewife, Francine Hughes Wilson, who lit her husband on fire while he was sleeping, in retaliation for years of brutality, was viewed by 75 million people. The movie was crucial in transforming public understanding of spousal abuse: Shelters for battered women began opening around the country; the police began to take the issue more seriously; women who killed battering partners, and children who killed battering parents, were understood to be victims of a destructive syndrome that often gave them judicial reprieve.\n\nBest-selling thrillers like \u201cFlowers in the Attic\u201d and \u201cWhen the Bough Breaks\u201d took on child abuse and molestation, and by the 1990s we began to see the spread of community notification laws that required convicted sex offenders to register. The law followed in a sense what narrative awakened first.\n\nThe movement against sexual harassment had something else, however: a mass-market antagonist in the empire of Helen Gurley Brown and Cosmopolitan magazine, which preached a feminism of patriarchal compliance. Brown encouraged young women to work hard, build careers and run companies, but to accomplish it all by coddling the men they worked with and finding sexual freedom along the way. In \u201cSex and the Office,\u201d Brown\u2019s sequel to her loopy best-selling instructional \u201cSex and the Single Girl,\u201d she delivered a playbook for the way young women should understand male bosses that included lessons in making them feel godlike. Colleagues were potential sexual partners and the cubicle was Tinder: \u201cThough it may seem to the untrained eye that you are selflessly working on office projects together, what you are really doing is sinking into them like a cobalt treatment so that you may make off with them after work.\u201d\n\nThe book appeared in 1968 and in 2004 was reissued with an enthusiastic blurb from Donald Trump. In the 1990s, Brown\u2019s brand of feminism, dependent on the idea that women needed to work within the structures available to them, gained a new currency and held on for a long time. MacKinnon, of course, believed that the structure itself was the problem, a notion that for more than three decades has largely been received as benighted and fusty.

In \u201cJane Eyre,\u201d she wrote from the first-person perspective of a child, an innovation that gave voice and power even to the very young; she created, too, a heroine who was, like Bront\u00eb herself, plain, pale, small, and yet frankly desirous, as well as worthy of desire.\n\nBront\u00eb once wrote to a friend that she considered the marital ambitions of women of no means or beauty \u201can imbecility which I reject with contempt,\u201d a practical response to the frank injustices of class and a kind of sexism. In her novels, however, those same plain women are entitled to not just any marriages, but to passionate, loving ones. The interior lives of Jane Eyre and Lucy Snowe are shared in such detail that the characters\u2019 unfair burdens are plainly manifest; Bront\u00eb could make great sweeping plotlines of the small moments and humiliations in an unmarried woman\u2019s life. Lucy Snowe\u2019s struggle to find a private place to read a long-awaited letter reads, over several pages, with the suspense and drama of a Spenserian quest.\n\nA miniaturist of the soul, Bront\u00eb captured shades of emotion with a psychological subtlety that still feels exquisitely modern. When Lucy Snowe, battling depression, is advised to cultivate her own happiness, her strong response will feel familiar to many a 21st-century person who has the condition: \u201cNo mockery in this world ever sounds to me so hollow as that of being told to cultivate happiness,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHappiness is not a potato to be planted in mould and tilled with manure.\u201d\n\nShe had a mordant wit, which could protect her only so much from the series of losses that left her so fragile. \u201cIt is useless to tell you how I live,\u201d she wrote to a friend in 1851. \u201cI endure life \u2014 but whether I enjoy it or not is another question.\u201d She startled readily, and wrote to friends complaining of crushing insomnia, a poor appetite, grief and flashbacks; she put off writing letters for fear of how dejected she would feel if the replies came too slowly. Her two most intense romantic passions \u2014 one, involving a married Belgian school master, was meticulously memorialized in \u201cVillette\u201d; the other, for her publisher, George Smith (also captured in the characteristics of a doctor in \u201cVillette\u201d) \u2014 were both unrequited.\n\nBut reader, she married, eventually, at the age of 38, choosing Arthur Bell Nicholls, a pastor who worked for Bront\u00eb\u2019s father. Although she acknowledged frankly that he was not her intellectual equal, he pursued her persistently, and against her father\u2019s wishes, possibly imbuing a late-in-life courtship with a jolt of romance.\n\nDid Bront\u00eb ultimately find the kind of happiness that she described as \u201ca glory shining far down upon us out of heaven\u201d? In \u201cVillette,\u201d Lucy Snowe describes her own feelings about happiness: \u201cThe negation of severe suffering was the nearest approach to happiness I expected to know. Besides, I seemed to hold two lives \u2014 the life of thought, and that of reality. And provided the former was nourished with a sufficiency of strange and necromantic joys of fancy, the privileges of the latter might remain limited to daily bread, hourly work and a roof of shelter.\u201d Once Bront\u00eb married, however, her life of thought suffered. \u201cMy own life is more occupied than it used to be,\u201d she wrote to a friend. \u201cI have not so much time for thinking.\u201d\n\nLiterature would no longer be the business of her life; whether the pleasures of marriage could offset that loss remains unclear. To one friend, she wrote, \u201cIt is a solemn and strange and perilous thing for a woman to become a wife.\u201d But several months later, she wrote, \u201cI have a good, kind attached husband, and every day makes my own attachment to him stronger.\u201d", "keywords": ["eyre", "snowe", "novelist", "overlooked", "bront\u00eb", "friend", "jane", "women", "charlotte", "villette", "life", "married", "wrote", "lucy", "known", "happiness"], "polarity": 0.15464722412090828, "subjectivity": 0.4587040517961569},

{"title": "\n                    The Plight of Working Women, as Seen by the Woman in the Corner Office                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/books/review/joanne-lipman-thats-what-she-said-women-at-work.html", "text": "It\u2019s an unfortunate opening salvo, as one could surmise that Lipman\u2019s compassion for white men burdened by the demands of \u201coutsiders\u201d is the organizing principle for what\u2019s to come. It\u2019s not. Instead, she offers a persuasive examination of the innumerable institutionalized prejudices, roadblocks and often unconscious undermining that women face in nearly every aspect of public and private life. Some of her facts will be familiar to H.R. directors, women\u2019s studies scholars and reporters who cover gender equality. They will likely be revelatory to nearly everyone else. Lipman\u2019s not wrong that those with power are loath to give it up: One study by Catalyst, an organization devoted to working women, found that 74 percent of men surveyed on what undermines their support for gender equality said fear \u2014 of loss of status, of other men\u2019s disapproval and of making a mistake \u2014 all of which, Lipman writes, has men \u201cwalking around on eggshells.\u201d But she also believes that most men, certainly those in the upper echelons of management, \u201cdon\u2019t need beating up with a two-by-four. They\u2019d like to see an equitable workplace, they just can\u2019t figure out what they\u2019re supposed to do about it.\u201d She\u2019s here to tell them; here\u2019s hoping they\u2019re paying attention.\n\nPhoto\n\nLipman, a former journalist for The Wall Street Journal and the founding editor of the short-lived Cond\u00e9 Nast business magazine Portfolio, is a skilled assembler of data and a graceful storyteller. She starts with a sketch of just how male by default the universe is, from the standard office temperature (set to accommodate the higher metabolic rate of 40-year-old, 154-pound, suit-wearing men) and male-centric design at Apple (the iPhone 6 Plus was too big for many women\u2019s hands and pockets) to the potentially dangerous side effects for women of the original prescribed doses of Ambien, a drug that was tested only on men, a still-common practice. All due, in part, to the lack of women in decision-making roles across industries and sectors, which, the data clearly show, is a financial mistake.\n\nA lot of assertions in the book begin with \u201cstudies have shown\u201d\u2014 a suspicious tactic. (Was the study that found a new potion \u201celiminated every wrinkle in a week\u201d conducted with the 12 people who work at that beauty start-up? Or was it a double-blind, controlled trial by a credible research team?) Yet each fact here is carefully accounted for on the nearly 50 pages of notes at the end of the book. It\u2019s not necessarily persuasive to read that \u201cmultiple studies have found that adding women to all-male teams leads to greater financial success,\u201d but this claim is bolstered by data from several sources, including The Journal of Financial Economics (\u201cFemale executives make more profitable acquisitions and take on less debt than male executives\u201d), Catalyst (\u201cFirms with the most female board members outperform those with the least by almost every financial measure\u201d) and the Credit Suisse Research Institute (\u201cCompanies whose top management is at least half female post returns on equity that are 19 percent higher than average\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a chapter titled \u201cWe\u2019re All a Little Bit Sexist,\u201d Lipman walks us through the thicket of research on cultural biases against women, which start almost from birth: Mothers overestimate the crawling ability of sons and underestimate that of daughters. Parents are 2.5 times more likely to query Google about whether their 2-year-old is a genius if that 2-year-old is a boy. In one study, girls outscored boys on math tests when there were no names on the papers given to teachers to grade; on the same tests with names attached, the boys outscored the girls. Women are 33 percent more likely to earn a college degree than men, even though professors are more likely to call on the men. Women are also more likely to be interrupted, despite speaking less than their male classmates.\n\nIn the working world, well, it gets worse: A Carnegie Mellon University study found that when an equal number of job-seeking men and women visited 100 recruitment sites, men were shown the ad for the highest-paying job six times more often than women were. Lipman dismantles the so-called \u201cpipeline theory,\u201d which posits that when women enter the work force at the same rate as men, they will reach management positions in equal numbers. In the early 1990s, more than half of law-school students were women, so, according to the pipeline theory, by now 50 percent of partners at law firms should be women as well. But by 2013, women held just 17 percent of those jobs, a pattern that Lipman says holds steady across \u201cany\u201d industry.\n\nPhoto\n\nShe also debunks James Damore\u2019s argument that the lack of gender parity at Google (about 70 percent of its employees are male) is a failure of nature by citing the in-house experts the company assigned to fix the problem. She interviews Brian Welle, a Google data scientist, and Laszlo Bock, a former head of its People Operations, who began working on the issue in 2006 and who eventually determined that Google\u2019s employees \u201cclearly had blind spots about their own prejudices against women and minorities.\u201d (Google\u2019s famously elaborate hiring process, in which candidates are evaluated, primarily by men, for their \u201cGoogleyness\u201d \u2014 the qualities that made them likely to fit in at the company \u2014 presumably had something to do with this.)\n\nThe Google case study is among several Lipman uses to propel a narrative about the uncertain status of women in the workplace. She recounts how jealousy of the woman who built the Tupperware company into a household name in the 1950s drove its founder to fire her and write her out of the company\u2019s history, and she explains why Iceland is the only country in the world where men and women share power in almost equal numbers: After the global financial crisis of 2008, Icelanders embraced the idea that the bank failures were, as the female director of the country\u2019s Chamber of Commerce put it, the result of a \u201cpenis competition\u201d among bankers. Not only did Icelanders jail unscrupulous bankers but they also elected more women to government posts, including that of prime minister, and mandated that women make up 40 percent of corporate boards.\n\nLipman needs these stories to help give dimension to her statistics \u2014 though many women may find the statistics comforting all on their own, if only because they document an unease that many feel but can\u2019t name. For instance: Women are 15 percent less likely to get promoted than men, in part because men get promoted for \u201cpotential,\u201d while women get promoted for performance. And both men and women would rather work for a male boss \u2014 they\u2019d even take a lower salary to ensure it. The self-annihilating absurdity of this last fact underlies some of the more important insights in \u201cThat\u2019s What She Said,\u201d which have to do with the unconscious bias women seem to have against themselves. Women in academia spend more time than men revising papers, in part because they\u2019re reluctant to burden anyone with what they feel is subpar work but also because they\u2019re so much more sensitive to criticism and hope to eliminate the possibility of any. Women underestimate their abilities at the same rate that men overestimate theirs, and a woman\u2019s self-esteem is more closely tied to compliments and criticism from her boss, with praise being more meaningful to women than even a raise or a promotion.\n\nBut men have sensitivities too, and the shame of holding a lower-status job than a woman, particularly if that woman is a romantic partner, apparently runs deep. Lipman quotes two studies that hint at what men don\u2019t often admit, much less even know. One is a study of heterosexual, college-age couples, in which both parties were asked to take a test. When the women were told that their boyfriends had scored higher on the test than they had, the women were unfazed. When the men were told that their girlfriends had done better, their self-esteem plummeted. Yet it rose when they were told that their girlfriends had done poorly. The other study found that men who earned less money than their wives were more likely to cheat. And when Lipman quizzed male executives on what it was about working with women that flummoxed them most, the resounding consensus was a crying woman. When women cry, a man\u2019s testosterone drops, which makes him depressed. If he only knew that women typically don\u2019t cry at work because they\u2019re sad. According to the research Lipman cites, women cry in the office because they\u2019re angry.\n\nThere is much to recommend this book, especially now, when record numbers of women are organizing, preparing to run for office and demanding change. So it\u2019s a bit disheartening to get to the end with only a handful of paragraphs on sexual harassment. Lipman managed to fold in a reference to Harvey Weinstein, but if there\u2019s one thing missing, it\u2019s a consideration of how sexual harassment, and the perhaps less quantifiable issue of why men fear ascendant women, lead to the disparities that she documents so persuasively. She is optimistic that men are capable of acting not only out of self-interest \u2014 though it\u2019s true, more female colleagues will make them richer \u2014 but out of the same moral imperative that once led privileged white men to abolish slavery and to \u201cgive\u201d women the right to vote. Lipman offers 12 \u201ctips and takeaways\u201d for moving forward, one of which inspired her title. To address what we might call the \u201cacknowledgment gap,\u201d she exhorts those paying attention in a meeting to repeat a statement that a woman has already made, to ensure she\u2019s recognized for it. Like her other suggestions, it\u2019s a nice idea, one that\u2019s been circulating among working women for a while. It reinforces her conviction that we must be vigilant in matters large and small if we want to shift the culture.

There\u2019s no glamour in \u201cBrave,\u201d and very little joy; I\u2019ve never read anything that makes being a starlet sound so tedious and demeaning.\n\nBook Review Rose McGowan on \u2018Brave\u2019 McGowan talks about her new memoir, and Katie Kitamura discusses Tom Malmquist\u2019s new novel, \u201cIn Every Moment We Are Still Alive.\u201d Audio\n\nThe book hinges on McGowan\u2019s encounter with Weinstein, whom she refers to only as \u201cthe Monster.\u201d Here, for the first time, she tells the story of what he did to her. It\u2019s both disgusting and, if you\u2019ve followed the Weinstein coverage, very familiar. She was summoned to a morning meeting in the restaurant of an exclusive hotel in Park City, Utah. When she arrived, the restaurant\u2019s host directed her to Weinstein\u2019s suite, saying he was stuck on a call. \u201cI was certain we would be working together for many years to come, and we were here to plot out the grand arc of my career,\u201d McGowan writes.\n\nInstead, Weinstein pushed her into a room with a Jacuzzi and pulled off her clothes. \u201cI freeze, like a statue,\u201d she writes. As she describes it, he put her on the edge of the Jacuzzi, got in, and performed oral sex on her while masturbating. Her experience sounds similar to the one that the actress and director Asia Argento described to The New Yorker. Like Argento, McGowan says that she feigned pleasure in the hopes of bringing the event to a quicker conclusion. \u201cHe moans loudly; through my tears I see his semen floating on top of the bubbles,\u201d she writes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfterward, McGowan writes, she was taken to a photo-op with Ben Affleck, her co-star in \u201cPhantoms,\u201d a movie she was promoting. Seeing her shaken and hearing where she came from, the actor said, \u201cGoddamn it. I told him to stop doing that.\u201d (It\u2019s unclear what Affleck meant by that statement; he has never responded to the accusation that he knew about Weinstein\u2019s abuse.) Others, McGowan writes, \u201ccounseled me to see it as something that would help my career in the long run.\u201d Wanting to press charges, she spoke to a criminal attorney who told her she would never be believed.\n\nPhoto\n\nSoon she heard that Weinstein was calling around town telling people not to hire her. \u201cIt seemed like every creep in Hollywood knew about my most vulnerable and violated moment,\u201d she writes. \u201cAnd I was the one who was punished for it.\u201d Her film career was derailed.\n\nMcGowan would eventually find success playing one of a trio of witches on the TV show \u201cCharmed.\u201d She describes working on the show as a deadening experience, a \u201cprison for my mind.\u201d Her sense of martyrdom can be a bit much; she writes of feeling \u201crobbed\u201d by having to get married on TV before her real wedding. \u201cYour entertainment comes at a cost to us performers,\u201d McGowan writes. \u201cYou should know this and acknowledge.\u201d\n\nYet it\u2019s McGowan\u2019s profound dissatisfaction with her profession \u2014 one she seems to have fallen into rather than pursued \u2014 that has given her the freedom to gleefully burn bridges. She loathes the entertainment business, describing Hollywood as a cult worse than the one she grew up in. Though she\u2019s in her 40s, she sometimes writes with the grandiosity of an alienated adolescent whose mind was blown by \u201cThe Matrix.\u201d \u201cYou may think that what happens in Hollywood doesn\u2019t affect you,\u201d she writes. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. My darlings, who do you think is curating your reality?\u201d\n\nFor most adult readers, it won\u2019t be much of a revelation that Hollywood trades in distortion and exploitation. But I hope \u201cBrave\u201d finds its way into the hands of teenage girls who may still look to actresses as they try to figure out how they\u2019re supposed to be in the world, girls who aspire to the life McGowan once had. In the end, McGowan finds a measure of peace and redemption when she moves behind the camera, becoming a director and multimedia artist, subject rather than object.

The book takes digressive turns (long walks and talks about art abound) and structural liberties (some of the dialogue among Sheila and her friends, including her painter confidante, Margaux, appears in the form of a play) on the road to both self-discovery and the realization of \u201cthe true singularity\u201d of others.\n\nThe roads Chew-Bose follows in her slim collection of 14 visually and verbally astute essays lead inward. She narrates her discursive thoughts in a breathless torrent of thrillingly precise observations about everyday life (\u201cthe rubbery satisfaction of yanking a single blade of grass from its root\u201d) and minute reflections on cultural figures and their work, from the playwright Annie Baker to the Beastie Boys to Janet Jackson.

Paper, $24.95.\n\nGwendolyn Elizabeth Brooks was born in Topeka, Kan., at 1 p.m. on Thursday, June 7, 1917.\n\nBut her family moved to Chicago shortly after her birth, and she was a Chicagoan until her death, in 2000. The author of more than 20 volumes of poetry, Brooks holds the distinction of being the first African-American to win a Pulitzer Prize (in 1950, for her second book of poems, \u201cAnnie Allen\u201d), and she received numerous accolades, including the National Medal of Arts and an American Academy of Arts and Letters Award. In honor of the centennial year of her birth, two anthologies have arrived: \u201cRevise the Psalm,\u201d edited by Quraysh Ali Lansana and Sandra Jackson-Opoku; and \u201cThe Golden Shovel Anthology,\u201d edited by Peter Kahn, Ravi Shankar and Patricia Smith.\n\nIn their shared mission, these books complement each other without too much overlap. The novelist Richard Wright, in a reader\u2019s report for Harper & Brothers in the early 1940s, declared Brooks essential: \u201cAmerica needs a voice like hers.\u201d Confirming Wright\u2019s claim are the hundreds of artists represented in these two new anthologies, poets who have used her work as a prompt or a point of engagement.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe Golden Shovel Anthology\u201d structures itself around the form developed by the prodigious poet Terrance Hayes, whose own poem \u201cThe Golden Shovel\u201d opens the book. A Golden Shovel poem sneaks an existing poem into the end words of each line. That way, the new poem always remains in conversation with its precursor. In his introduction, Shankar writes that the anthology is \u201can inherently collaborative effort, a dialogue, a response,\u201d and the same description works for Hayes\u2019s form, which unites all of the poems here. Read their end words, and you\u2019ll find a Brooks poem. In the foreword, Hayes says he came up with the idea when he was helping his 5-year-old son memorize Brooks\u2019s \u201cWe Real Cool,\u201d which starts with a sort of subtitle or epigraph: \u201cThe Pool Players. / Seven at the Golden Shovel.\u201d The words of Brooks\u2019s poem moved into Hayes\u2019s head space and became a lyric to push against or engage:\n\nWhen I am so small Da\u2019s sock covers my arm, we\n\ncruise at twilight until we find the place the real men lean, bloodshot and translucent with cool.\n\nHis smile is a gold-plated incantation as we drift by women on bar stools, with nothing left\n\nin them but approachlessness. This is a school I do not know yet. But the cue sticks mean we\n\nare rubbed by light, smooth as wood, the lurk of smoke thinned to song. We won\u2019t be out late.\n\nStanding in the middle of the street last night we watched the moonlit lawns and a neighbor strike\n\nhis son in the face. A shadow knocked straight Da promised to leave me everything: the shovel we\n\nused to bury the dog, the words he loved to sing his rusted pistol, his squeaky Bible, his sin.\n\nThe boy\u2019s sneakers were light on the road. We watched him run to us looking wounded and thin.\n\nHe\u2019d been caught lying or drinking his father\u2019s gin. He\u2019d been defending his ma, trying to be a man. We\n\nstood in the road, and my father talked about jazz, how sometimes a tune is born of outrage. By June\n\nthe boy would be locked upstate. That night we got down on our knees in my room. If I should die\n\nbefore I wake. Da said to me, it will be too soon.\n\nNestled into the last word of each line is Brooks\u2019s canonical poem: \u201cWe real cool. We/ Left school. \u2026\u201d Throughout this anthology, more than 60 other well-known Brooks poems can be read the same way, with lines from \u201cThe Mother\u201d and \u201cThe Bean Eaters\u201d tripping down the right-hand side of the page. The anthology ends with \u201cNon-Brooks Golden Shovels\u201d and \u201cVariations and Expansions on the Form.\u201d The cross-section of poets with varying poetics and styles gathered here is only one of the many admirable achievements of this volume.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cRevise the Psalm\u201d brings a more expansive response to Brooks. The editors have included poetry, prose, photographs and paintings created in recognition of both Brooks and her work. Essays speak back to individual poems like \u201cThe Mother,\u201d or reflect on Brooks\u2019s impact or on personal encounters with her. We get a keen sense of the poet and her fierce commitment to community engagement. For example, Adrian Matejka writes about attending a reading where Brooks spent more time reading poems by elementary school children than reading her own work.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Most notable is the author\u2019s photo by Roy Lewis, for her 1969 book \u201cRiot,\u201d with Brooks wearing the Afro that signified her break with her mainstream publisher as she joined the voices of the Black Arts Movement. Lansana and Jackson-Opoku, the editors of \u201cRevise the Psalm,\u201d use the phrase \u201c\u2018Gwendolynian\u2019 influences,\u201d describing their anthology as \u201ca project of literary and artistic revision, the process of \u2018talking back\u2019 to works that inspire, teach, challenge and engage.\u201d Not surprisingly, given this endeavor, the book includes some Golden Shovel poems.\n\nMore often than not, however, the poems in \u201cRevise the Psalm\u201d are more loosely inspired by Brooks\u2019s subjects. Consider \u201cDaystar,\u201d by Rita Dove. (She is one of a handful of poets who appear in both volumes.) Though written for Dove\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning book \u201cThomas and Beulah,\u201d \u201cDaystar\u201d takes on a subject that was of central importance to Brooks \u2014 the quotidian outer life and the rich inner life of African-American mothers:\n\nShe wanted a little room for thinking:\n\nbut she saw diapers steaming on the line,\n\na doll slumped behind the door.\n\nSo she lugged a chair behind the garage\n\nto sit out the children\u2019s naps. Sometimes there were things to watch:\n\nthe pinched armor of a vanished cricket,\n\na floating maple leaf.

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/books/review/match-book-motherhood.html", "text": "Photo\n\nDear Match Book,\n\nI have been struggling to choose a good book to read in the last months of my first pregnancy. It seems to me few novels engage with motherhood, and those that do are dated, depressing or dystopian. I\u2019ve heard Margaret Atwood\u2019s \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d mentioned, especially with the Hulu adaptation, but that\u2019s about it. Are there any feminist writers who can articulate some positive experiences about being a mother? Given this may be the last time for a while I\u2019m able to read a book on more than three hours sleep, I really don\u2019t want to waste it on patronizing, preaching writing that leaves you despairing and enraged. There is enough of that in the American parenting genre.\n\nSOPHIE MOULLIN\n\nPRINCETON, N.J.\n\nDear Sophie,\n\nCongratulations! And don\u2019t worry \u2014 books about motherhood deepen in meaning after you\u2019ve had the chance to hold your own baby. What\u2019s more, you may not sleep much, but as the mother of a newborn you\u2019ll become \u2014 temporarily \u2014 a shut-in with time to sneak in a few paragraphs between baby-gazing sessions.\n\nParenting Memoirs by Grown-Ups\n\nYou asked for novels, but you could start with two novelists\u2019 memoirs whose episodic styles are ideally structured to spell you in the early, disorienting days of motherhood. Rivka Galchen\u2019s slim collection of observant fragments, \u201cLittle Labors,\u201d captures a view of the postpartum life of the mind. Short sections (fleetingly) cover subjects from the mundane to the esoteric. A petty, belittling neighbor, two books from the 11th century written by Japanese women, and accounts of babies in the classics: Galchen wryly examines small moments in literature and life with the fresh eyes of a new mother.\n\nPart of the pleasure of Galchen\u2019s book is its grown-up tone, skeptical and gently mocking. For balance, try Louise Erdrich\u2019s \u201cThe Blue Jay\u2019s Dance,\u201d which takes a more reverent, though grounded view of motherhood. Throughout her meditative memoir, which spans one year of pregnancy and early parenthood, Erdrich chafes very little under the demands of motherhood. Instead her vivid, sensitive writing tracks changes in the natural world and her deepening bond with her baby.\n\nSisterhood in Mother Land\n\nAri, the narrator of Elisa Albert\u2019s novel \u201cAfter Birth,\u201d is refreshingly profane. A first-time mother and mostly friendless graduate student who lives with her English professor husband in a rundown town in upstate New York, Ari articulates the physical and psychological demands, loneliness and the desperate love inherent in her new role with obscene, comforting honesty. When Mina Morris, a pregnant former punk rocker \u2014 a bass player for a girl band called the Misogynists \u2014 assumes a post as visiting poet in the local English department, a complicated, intimate friendship between the two women ignites.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Her nurse and contemporary, Franckline \u2014 also pregnant, but not visibly so \u2014 guides and cares for Lore through her delivery. Flashbacks between contractions fill in both women\u2019s back stories. But even when Lore\u2019s delivery becomes dangerously complicated, the two women\u2019s tangled, fascinating histories remain hidden from each other.\n\nOther Mothers\n\nIf all this child-rearing realism leaves you longing for an escape, consider Eowyn Ivey\u2019s \u201cThe Snow Child,\u201d her 2012 debut rooted in a Russian fairy tale. For a time near the start of the novel, a childless couple named Mabel and Jack \u2014 homesteaders in Alaska in the 1920s \u2014 believe, in a fever of magical thinking, that they have conjured a real girl from a child they built out of snow. The arrival of this dream daughter gives Mabel and Jack hope. But the real magic lies in the exquisite emotional suspense that stretches throughout this novel.\n\nA timely heartbreaker published earlier this year, \u201cLucky Boy,\u201d by Shanthi Sekaran, follows two mothers who love one boy. Eighteen-year-old Soli leaves behind her parents and their way of life in Mexico and heads for California. Rishi and Kavya live in Berkeley and long for a child. After Soli is arrested and detained by immigration agents, her son, Ignacio, is placed in foster care with Kavya and Rishi, who nurture him with abandon while Soli remains in detention desperately planning to reclaim her child. The emotions in the book are complex and wrenching, but \u201cLucky Boy\u201d is ultimately a hopeful story about fierce mother love.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMatch Book\n\nDo you need book recommendations?

I\u2019m an introvert who never fits in anywhere I go. I\u2019m an atheist who works at a church and a woman who works in a tech department.\n\nI\u2019ve just recently begun dating an awesome woman from New York City. She loves to read George Saunders and Octavia E. Butler and watch \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201d and \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d (she\u2019s also read the books by George R. R. Martin). Can you help me think of a book I could recommend for her that would knock her adorable socks off?\n\nLAURIE STEVENS\n\nNASHVILLE, TENN.\n\nDear Laurie,\n\nYour letter sparked a burst of gleeful nostalgia between an old friend and me: People are still wooing each other with books! Mixtapes may be virtually obsolete, my friend noted, but seduction through books \u2014 another courting method left over from the analog age \u2014 lives on.\n\nIt was during the heyday of mixtapes that I first read \u201cGeek Love\u201d (1989) by Katherine Dunn. Before I picked up Dunn\u2019s novel about the Binewskis, a family of self-styled carnival freaks, I had been semi-estranged from fantastical fiction since childhood. But Dunn\u2019s daring spectacular \u2014 told in a torrent of sharp, detailed language \u2014 about family and love and belonging pulled me back into the realm of fantasy.\n\nPlenty of contemporary fiction flirts with fantasy \u2014 a superpower here, a portal there \u2014 but Nnedi Okorafor\u2019s 2010 novel \u201cWho Fears Death\u201d is an ambitious, sprawling true science fiction novel that grapples with race and gender. Set in a post-apocalyptic African world, the book tells the story of a shape-shifting sorceress named Onyesonwu with a heroic, tragic destiny. Her fully imagined emotional and physical life connects with vivid sensory details (this book describes such intense smells!) and an emphasis on the power of stories to create a world that feels very real, despite the novel\u2019s wild, speculative elements.\n\nThe connections made in \u201cThe Passion,\u201d Jeanette Winterson\u2019s historical fairy tale published in 1987, are erotic and semi-supernatural. Set in Europe (mainly Venice) during the Napoleonic Wars, the book alternates between the narration of Henri, who wants to be a drummer in Napoleon\u2019s army, but ends up a cook, and Villanelle, the cross-dressing daughter of a Venetian boatman, born with webbed feet during a solar eclipse. Their narratives eventually weave together, passing in and out of magic and revealing how both characters are driven by lust and undone by love.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But what sets this moving and mysterious novel apart is Hunt\u2019s understanding of children and outcasts and those unfortunate characters who are both. The children in \u201cMr. Splitfoot\u201d \u2014 Ruth and her tormentor/savior, Nat \u2014 meet in a group home where, \u201cnew arrivals carve filthy words into their dry skin, aching for their absent mothers.\u201d Mothers, even absent ones, are the glue that fuses the two narratives into one journey.\n\nContrary to the dictates of their nature, vampires have thrived during their recent time in the sun. Their proliferation throughout popular culture takes nothing away from the magic of Karen Russell\u2019s short story collection \u201cVampires in the Lemon Grove.\u201d Not all of her stories feature the undead, though the weary fanged one in the title story has abundant charm and \u201ca tan that won\u2019t fade until I die (which I never will).\u201d Russell\u2019s command of the conventions of supernatural storytelling \u2014 which allows her to tweak the immortal and other supernatural forces \u2014 makes all her stories funny, poignant and profound.\n\nIn Kelly Link\u2019s short fiction anything is possible. A raucous birthday party on a spaceship, a child born without a shadow, and in \u201cOrigin Story\u201d \u2014 my favorite story in her collection \u201cGet in Trouble\u201d \u2014 there\u2019s even a defunct George Saunders-esque theme park based on \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d and a reference to \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer.\u201d In each of her fantastical tales, Link creates a new universe from scratch, complete with different laws of physics. From story to story, the styles and environments vary so widely that it takes me a page or two to adjust to each new atmosphere. The supernatural results are disorienting and dazzling, but Link\u2019s characters are so familiar and human \u2014 even when they are not \u2014 that it\u2019s easy to fall in love.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMatch Book\n\nNeed something to read?

She has spoken often about the pleasure she takes in fashion, and she is the face of Boots No7, a makeup brand.\n\nMs. Adichie has cultivated these two strands of her identity: the serious literary author and the fashion icon. In turn, she has been celebrated both by mainstream pop culture and the literati. She won a MacArthur fellowship in 2008, and her novel \u201cAmericanah\u201d won the 2013 National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction and was chosen as New York City\u2019s \u201cOne Book\u201d for 2017. Her 2012 TEDx talk, \u201cWe Should All Be Feminists,\u201d was sampled by Beyonc\u00e9 in her music, and excerpts appeared on T-shirts at Dior\u2019s Paris Fashion Week show last year. The pop and the literary threads are not opposites to her, and their merger is central to the way she presents her public self and her work.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very important that brilliant women step up and be hot babes,\u201d Ms. Adichie joked in a conversation with the author Zadie Smith in 2014.\n\nPhoto\n\nSo in the past few years, she has become something of a star, flourishing at the unlikely juncture of fiction writing and celebrity. Her position was on full display during her visit to New York, where she started her book tour last week. She took the stage in front of a sold-out crowd at Cooper Union, and there was \u201cthis kind of unanimous scream,\u201d said Robin Desser, a Knopf editor who has worked with Ms. Adichie for 12 years.\n\n\u201cI really have never seen anything like this,\u201d Ms. Desser said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve published people who are really popular.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe main proposition of \u201cDear Ijeawele\u201d is that feminism is a project that necessarily binds mothers and daughters, and that raising a daughter feminist has as much to do with what you tell yourself as what you tell her. Ms. Adichie\u2019s first of 15 suggestions places a mother\u2019s freedom and growth at the center of a daughter\u2019s feminist education.\n\n\u201cBe a full person,\u201d Ms. Adichie writes. \u201cMotherhood is a glorious gift, but do not define yourself solely by motherhood.\u201d\n\nThe book grew partly out of the desire of Ms. Adichie\u2019s friend, called Ijeawele in the text, to teach her daughter \u201cto take less of the nonsense\u201d that past generations faced. Ms. Adichie wrote her friend a letter in 2015 and published it on Facebook last year.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The responses she received made her even more sure that it was an important piece to write.\n\n\u201cEven friends of mine \u2014 people I love \u2014 wrote, \u2018why yes, we kind of agree, but why call it feminist? It\u2019s just common sense.\u2019 And I\u2019m like no, it\u2019s feminist,\u201d Ms. Adichie said. \u201cOr, oh it\u2019s just humanism. Or someone said, \u2018these are just democratic ideals.\u2019 And I thought, what? It\u2019s everything but to acknowledge the fact that gender is a problem.\u201d\n\nMs. Adichie wrote the letter before she was a parent, but now she has a 17-month-old daughter whom she is trying to raise as a feminist. She and her husband split their time between Nigeria, where she grew up, and the United States.\n\nMs. Adichie often comments on how race and gender play out in the United States, but her book does not tackle some of the meatier questions that have occupied the American feminist movement in recent years, most notably the role of transgender people.\n\nOn this book tour, after we spoke, Ms. Adichie made controversial comments suggesting that transgender women experience male privilege before they transition. For activists who have been grappling with these questions for years, the comments came across as ill-informed. Asked about them, Ms. Adichie suggested through a spokesman that people go to her Facebook page, where she has posted several responses, acknowledging that her comments \u201cupset many people, and I consider their concerns to be valid.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see how my saying that we should not conflate the gender experiences of trans women with that of women born female could appear as if I was suggesting that one experience is more important than the other. Or that the experiences of trans women are less valid than those of women born female,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI do not think so at all \u2014 I know that trans women can be vulnerable in ways that women born female are not.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Adichie has written about Hillary Clinton for The Atlantic and Michelle Obama in T: The New York Times Style Magazine, and last summer wrote a short story in The Times imagining Melania Trump\u2019s experience on the campaign trail. Although she was an enthusiastic Hillary Clinton supporter in the election, she sees Mrs. Trump as a sympathetic character.\n\n\u201cI think there is some misogyny in the way she\u2019s been characterized, and I think it\u2019s ugly,\u201d Ms. Adichie said. She becomes animated talking about the vitriol aimed at Mrs. Trump, in the same way she bristles when asked about how Mrs. Clinton was treated during the campaign. She is concerned with how society responds to powerful women across the political spectrum.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even like talking about it, because I get very upset,\u201d she said while describing the media\u2019s focus on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201clikability.\u201d (One of the suggestions in her book is for mothers to teach daughters to \u201creject likability.\u201d)\n\nMs. Adichie will not say what she\u2019s working on next \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m very superstitious\u201d \u2014 but continues to write and throw herself into her international speaking engagements. The satisfaction she takes in her work is at the heart of her proposal: To raise feminist daughters, mothers must take pleasure in their own achievements, follow both the challenges and delights of the work, and give themselves room to fail.

In 1983, Paule Marshall, best known for her novel \u201cBrown Girl, Brownstones,\u201d reflected on how observing her mother\u2019s relationship to language inspired her career. An excerpt follows.\n\nI grew up among poets. Now they didn\u2019t look like poets \u2014 whatever that breed is supposed to look like. Nothing about them suggested that poetry was their calling. They were just a group of ordinary housewives and mothers, my mother included, who dressed in a way (shapeless housedresses, dowdy felt hats and long, dark, solemn coats) that made it impossible for me to imagine they had ever been young.\n\nNor did they do what poets were supposed to do \u2014 spend their days in an attic room writing verses. Several mornings a week these unknown bards would put an apron and a pair of old house shoes in a shopping bag and take the train or streetcar from our section of Brooklyn out to Flatbush. There, those who didn\u2019t have steady jobs would wait on certain designated corners for the white housewives in the neighborhood to come along and bargain with them over pay for a day\u2019s work cleaning their houses. Later, armed with the few dollars they had earned, which in their vocabulary became \u201ca few raw-mouth pennies,\u201d they made their way back to our neighborhood, where they would sometimes stop off to have a cup of tea or cocoa together before going home to cook dinner for their husbands and children.\n\nThere was no way for me to understand it at the time, but the talk that filled the kitchen those afternoons was highly functional. It served as therapy, the cheapest kind available to my mother and her friends. It restored them to a sense of themselves and reaffirmed their self-worth. Through language they were able to overcome the humiliations of the work day. Confronted by a world they could not encompass, they took refuge in language.\n\nThey taught me my first lessons in the narrative art. They trained my ear. They set a standard of excellence. This is why the best of my work must be attributed to them; it stands as testimony to the rich legacy of language and culture they so freely passed on to me in the wordshop of the kitchen.", "keywords": ["language", "work", "notes", "way", "ordinary", "mother", "look", "book", "poets", "neighborhood", "archives", "supposed", "review", "mothers"], "polarity": 0.106871921182266, "subjectivity": 0.42137110016420365},

Le Guin\n\n215 pp. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. $22.\n\nPhoto\n\nLe Guin (who died in January) has written before about the genre for which she is best known, and explains herein that \u201cthe fantastic tale may suspend the laws of physics \u2026 but it carries its revolt against reality no further.\u201d That is, the author of fantasy must have a sharp understanding of emotional, social and political realities. Such intelligence gleams in these essays, culled from several years of blog posts. Le Guin claims the form \u201csounds like a sodden tree trunk in a bog\u201d and calls her own attempts \u201cmore trivially personal\u201d than those that inspired her. But the trivially personal is a chief pleasure of this collection, which uses its firm footing in the concrete world to ponder an eclectic array of topics. The pages sparkle with lines that make a reader glance up, searching for an available ear with which to share them.\n\n\u201cOld age is for anybody who gets there,\u201d Le Guin asserts in a scorching section about aging, while two others describe the travails of her cat, Pard, with less irony than J. R. Ackerley\u2019s memoir of his dog, Tulip, but no less charm.

Or rather, because he has loved some women and one cat, and learned a few things along the way. In a style reminiscent of Orwell, E. B. White and David Sedaris, an affable hero gamely bumbles through adventures rich with moments of fleeting profundity and moral reckoning. He follows a manic circus tutor on a train to Mexico, falls for a fellow cartoonist amid the early aughts\u2019 war on terror and trysts with a politically enlightened prostitute. These stories entertain, though I prefer him being wittily deprecated by his female companions to his drawing binaries between \u201c\u2018Type A\u2019: smart, pretty, sane, moral girls with glasses who tended to work for nonprofits or write\u201d and \u201cbawdy dominatrices\u201d (to be fair, this reviewer is a Type A, former bawdy dominatrix who writes).

Describing the emotional rush of an evening spent colluding and conjoining, she sounds as if she has a new crush: \u201cI related to every single thing she said,\u201d Schaefer tells us, reporting that they discussed \u201cthings I don\u2019t typically share with someone I\u2019m just sitting down with for the first time.\u201d She gushes to her mother via text the next day: \u201cI have a new best friend. \u2026 I love her.\u201d\n\nIn a year that has been described as a women\u2019s renaissance, female friendship feels particularly worthy of contemplation. As professional opportunities broaden and cultural attitudes shift, competition between women has given way to allyship. Through the return of women\u2019s social organizations and the formalization of whisper networks, female solidarity is more pervasive than ever, a byproduct of girl power and the cumulation of years of quiet rebellion.\n\n\u201cWomen are stepping up together, loudly and publicly,\u201d writes Schaefer, a journalist whose subjects have ranged from the Korean beauty industry to the occult. It seems the world is finally recognizing the power of female connection, which the poet Adrienne Rich once described as \u201cthe most feared, the most problematic and the most potentially transforming force on the planet.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat girl hasn\u2019t buzzed with the rare thrill of a new friendship? It offers a shared hiding place and a secret understanding outside the reach of men, parents, employers; someone who hates everything you hate, who takes on your causes as her own; someone who, after leaving you at the end of the night, cares that you get home safely.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn many of our lives, friendships matter as much as romantic relationships. Friends are our soul mates \u2014 and, more practically, our emergency contacts. Why then, Schaefer asks, is friendship as an institution not afforded the same benefits and privileges as marriage? It\u2019s a position that has been gaining steam in the legal community, among advocates of so-called friendship law like Rachel Moran, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has argued that platonic bonds ought to matter \u201cnot only in my own intimate life, but in the eyes of the law.\u201d", "keywords": ["text", "female", "womens", "power", "friendship", "girl", "squads", "romantic", "potential", "action", "law", "matter", "schaefer"], "polarity": 0.14661102786102786, "subjectivity": 0.47259892884892873},

Alizadeh raps, \u201cLet me scream, I\u2019m tired of silence,\u201d while lifting a Western-style wedding veil. Beneath it her face is made up to look as if she\u2019s been beaten: swollen eyes and bruised jaw. It\u2019s a powerful image, one that Bagieu doesn\u2019t hesitate to draw into the strip.\n\nVideo\n\nAnd Bagieu\u2019s drawings are wonderful. Though sometimes spare, with minimal effort spent on backgrounds, her line manages to flow and skate through 29 stories of remarkable women. These drawings can act. They are alive with gestural attitude. They move, dance, struggle, fight back, fall in love, resist and wonder at the world. Some ham it up. Some suffer terrible abuse. To her credit, Bagieu doesn\u2019t back away from drawing the marks of violence on their faces and their bodies, which may come as a surprise to those who are expecting a rah-rah young adult girl-power sort of read.\n\nBagieu calls these comics \u201cbroad stroke portraits,\u201d and explains the sometimes too breezy storytelling this way: \u201cThis book is by no means a thorough scholarly work; rather, it\u2019s one woman\u2019s tribute \u2014 my homage to the full, daring lives they lead, often against great odds.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAll of her stories follow a similar pattern. Almost every page has nine frames and each biography begins with a portrait drawn in a beribboned oval template. They cover the birth, life and death of each of her subjects in a way that can feel a bit formulaic, but this seems to have more to do with the fact that the English translation is typeset rather than in Bagieu\u2019s handwriting.\n\nIn the original version of these strips, which are luckily available in French on the Le Monde website, where they originally appeared, the difference is instantly apparent. The nature of handwriting gives the portraits a more personal \u201cvoice.\u201d It feels as if Bagieu herself is telling you these stories. They lose their Wikipedia tone and become more intimate, more like that of a cool fairy godmother recounting tales you need to hear without too much worry about sources, originality or historical accuracy. Her handwriting preserves her passion, along with clear intent to both delight and embolden the reader.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt\u2019s painful to see this crucial part of her work replaced with type. It changes everything about how the stories are received. The reading speed is altered. The tone and the visual relationship between the text and the drawing just isn\u2019t there. It\u2019s her handwriting that makes these panels spring to life. Panels that seemed awkwardly composed suddenly become elegant and beautifully balanced. It\u2019s hard for people to understand the importance of a cartoonist\u2019s handwriting. In the same way melody transforms lyrics, handwriting transforms words and can have a profound impact on how the story is received and understood.\n\nSadly, nearly every scrap of Bagieu\u2019s lovely handwriting has been scrubbed and replaced in this translation, even when completely unnecessary. The only clue to this \u201cvoice\u201d is a rare lettered sign here and there, and her name, \u201cP\u00e9n\u00e9lope,\u201d sweetly signed at the end of each strip.\n\nThese \u201crebel ladies\u201d come from all over the world (though surprisingly over a third of them are American). They also come from all points in time, like Agnodice, whom Bagieu presents as a gutsy gynecologist from ancient Greece, to the astronaut Mae Jemison (the one with the tight Afro), to the \u201cAnimal Whisperer\u201d Temple Grandin and the \u201cLover of Modern Art\u201d Peggy Guggenheim (she\u2019s the one with the wild sunglasses). Bagieu includes sets of siblings, like the Wiggins sisters, who were forced by their father to form a rock band called \u201cThe Shaggs,\u201d and \u201cLas Mariposas,\u201d the Dominican Republic\u2019s Mirabel sisters, who were murdered during the Trujillo regime in 1960. And she profiles too one of my favorite women, Frances Glessner Lee, who helped crime scene investigators hone their craft by creating intensely accurate miniature replicas of rooms where murders took place.\n\nBagieu has dedicated this book to her own daughters, and I kept that in mind as I read it. When I imagine her telling these stories to them, I\u2019m reminded of something my grandmother would say when she told me these kinds of tales. \u201cOf course it is only a story my dear. But it is true!\u201d Bagieu\u2019s pen transforms these true stories into something that has the tone of a personalized fairy tale.

Some of Lazarin\u2019s stories \u2014 not coincidentally, my favorites \u2014 show women pinging furiously off one another instead of their boyfriends, husbands and fathers, gathering incremental surges of strength and autonomy and rage, of unspoken power. In \u201cThe Holographic Soul,\u201d two young sisters playact a psychic guessing game, then try to actually access their powers, longing for a presence to manifest itself and give them something solid on which to pin their anxieties. The two teenage friends in \u201cGone\u201d keep a list of real-life dead girls, sharing their fear as puberty descends. (\u201cGirls are taught to be discreet,\u201d Lazarin writes in a later story. \u201cBoys, who shout their own terror, make a mess of it, take you down with them.\u201d)\n\nPhoto\n\nIt\u2019s easy to anticipate criticism of \u201cBack Talk\u201d and its quietly realist, \u201cliterary\u201d writing. It won\u2019t help to note that Lazarin\u2019s characters are educated and middle- to upper-class, that her stories are often set in New York and Paris. They are, certainly, beautifully crafted. I loathe the word \u201cpolished\u201d in the context of prose. It\u2019s too clinical, implying that the work was dull before the author intentionally spruced it up. So I\u2019d prefer to say that the sentences in these stories are living and seamless, as if Lazarin had run her hand over them until they became smooth and gleaming with the evidence of her touch. Yet they are not without viscera; sublimated rage fills the crevices between them.\n\nLazarin\u2019s style succeeds in part because the stakes for her characters are wide-ranging, because the implications of their actions ripple outward. In \u201cBack Talk,\u201d the theme of internalized misogyny is, to be quite blunt, terrifying. It\u2019s all the scarier in that it\u2019s so quietly and accurately rendered: These women aren\u2019t running screaming through the night, fleeing to convents, joining all-female cults or driving off into the desert without looking back.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn \u201cSpider Legs,\u201d the teenage narrator goes to Paris to visit her mother, who is writing a book about St. Agnes. Long divorced from the girl\u2019s father, she has chosen as her subject this woman of early Christian Rome, honored by the church for spurning the marriage proposals that would have spared her from suffering and martyrdom. \u201cFor that, she was tortured, shamed, killed, of course,\u201d the narrator\u2019s mother tells her with a wry smile. \u201cNo sense of self-preservation, those saints.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Although Lazarin\u2019s work has the tone and style of traditional mainstream short fiction, it joins a growing canon of quietly realist stories that establish women\u2019s experiences as worthy of literary attention. And not just women\u2019s experiences: These stories also explore the exhausting, slow poison of masculine power, the grind of the patriarchy on even the most privileged of women, the subtle ways in which men have trained women to minimize themselves.\n\nThe hunger for these types of stories is powerful. How else to explain the ferocious explosion of emotion aroused by Kristen Roupenian\u2019s New Yorker story \u201cCat Person\u201d? It shared many qualities with Lazarin\u2019s work \u2014 quiet, literary, realist \u2014 but it made a particular generation of women feel as if they were about to crawl out of their skin, as if they suddenly remembered how bad things had been, how bad they could be, how bad they could get.\n\nIn \u201cAmerican Men in Paris I Did Not Love,\u201d Lazarin\u2019s narrator finds herself in the presence of an insufferable pedant who is probably married and certainly has designs on her. \u201cWe spend four hours together,\u201d she notes flatly, \u201cbefore I remember that I can just get up and go.\u201d And so these stories hand their warnings to us: Don\u2019t be pleasant or easy to teach.

The numerous heroines named in its pages, many of whom come and go with only a brief mention, challenge the reader to keep track. Yet their very multitude underscores Fara\u2019s underlying argument that there is nothing unusual about a feminine engagement with science. The love of botany, the passion for chemistry, the fascination with geology or cosmology is just as likely to animate a girl\u2019s mind as a boy\u2019s. If only her parents, her circumstances and the cultural norms of her country will answer her interest with education and opportunity, any girl may aspire to a lab of her own.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor all Fara\u2019s erudition and scholarship, not to mention her description of herself as a \u201cpernickety academic\u201d at Clare College, Cambridge, she writes without a trace of stuffiness. She also avoids whining about chances missed or credit denied. With the same refreshing approach to perceived injustice that she displayed in earlier books like \u201cPandora\u2019s Breeches\u201d and \u201cScience: A Four Thousand Year History,\u201d Fara bends her talents to a sprightly telling of what happened: \u201cAt Imperial College London, during the First World War, Muriel Baker \u2014 wife of the professor of inorganic chemistry \u2014 was isolated at home in a small laboratory where she experimented on using stockings stuffed with cotton wool to absorb poisonous gases.\u201d\n\nAmong the women Fara singles out for chapter-length treatment, Dr. Isabel Emslie Hutton led a particularly eventful life. \u201cTaught by her parents to give away all but one of her Christmas presents on New Year\u2019s Day, she committed herself to medicine at the age of 17, renouncing with the dedication of a nun all thoughts of marriage.\u201d Eventually she did marry Maj. Thomas Hutton, but not before working as a pathologist in a Scottish mental hospital, carrying out research into chemical tests for syphilis, selling experimental guinea pigs to laboratories throughout Scotland and seeing in the outbreak of World War I the opportunity to practice surgery, \u201cher favorite specialty but one normally reserved for men.\u201d\n\nUpon arrival in Salonika in October 1915, Emslie and her female colleagues \u201cbuilt incinerators, dug latrines, erected tents, installed X-ray equipment and set up a dispensary in a disused silkworm factory.\u201d She operated on wounded soldiers in a wooden hut.\n\nMilitary invasions and outbreaks of malaria kept Emslie moving from one field hospital to another \u2014 even serving as a commanding officer \u2014 all the way until the end of the war. Even then she stayed on in the region for two more years to treat civilian surgical patients in Serbia and children in Sebastopol.\n\nDespite Emslie\u2019s distinguished war record, her marriage in 1921 disqualified her from future employment as a surgeon in Britain. Resuming a prior interest, she served three decades as honorary consultant psychiatrist at the British Hospital for Mental and Nervous Disorders in Camden, \u201cplaying a key role in the introduction of psychoanalysis to Britain.\u201d At the same time she campaigned for equal pay for women doctors and helped women achieve international pilot\u2019s licenses by demonstrating that they were not \u201cincapable of flying during periods and pregnancies.\u201d When her husband was posted to India she gave up her own career to follow him. \u201cTrapped there during the Second World War,\u201d Isabel Emslie Hutton became director of the Indian Red Cross.\n\n\u201cA Lab of One\u2019s Own,\u201d with its title salute to Virginia Woolf, is primarily an English war story. \u201cBroad Band,\u201d in contrast, mostly takes place in the United States of the 1940s through the 1990s, and is peopled predominantly with all-American girls wanting, as Time magazine once quipped, \u201ca ROM of their own.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe author, Claire L. Evans, has met and managed to interview most of the principals in this recent history of technology.

When Radia Perlman, for example, enrolled in her first programming course as a high school student in the 1960s (and many more courses later as an odd-woman-out at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology), she discovered that her classmates had been dismantling radios and other electronics from a tender age. \u201cI never took anything apart,\u201d she told Evans. \u201cI would have assumed I would break it or get electrocuted.\u201d Nevertheless, Evans reports, Perlman invented a protocol for moving information that is now fundamental to the way computers are networked. \u201cHer work might be invisible to the everyday user, but it\u2019s invisible in the way that laws are invisible or the rules of traffic in a busy city are invisible: It directs the flow of information at a layer beyond our conscious awareness.\u201d\n\nSuch contributions embolden Evans to declare, with emphasis: \u201cEven when women were invisible, it never means they weren\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nIt is tempting to think these unsung female presences of the past paved the way for today\u2019s women scientists.

Along the way, she married an architect and had two sons, and she is brisk about the fact that her husband\u2019s staying at home with the boys \u2014 carting them around to sets as she wrote, produced and directed \u2014 is what made her employable.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn her 40s and beyond, female executives kept her afloat, she says. Scovell built up a deep network of friends and allies, though strikingly, even in the photos of her gang, she is usually the only woman. The book is laid out like the old joke about the arc of a Hollywood career: Part 1: \u201cWho is Nell Scovell?\u201d Part 2: \u201cGet me Nell Scovell!\u201d Part 3: \u201cGet me a younger, cheaper Nell Scovell!\u201d And finally: \u201cWho is Nell Scovell?\u201d\n\nJust as she is getting to that last stage, however, she meets Sandberg, whose spirit infuses this book: in the references to studies about how men are perceived as confident while women are taught to deflect credit, or in the anecdotes about how Scovell is judged on her presumed emotions rather than her actual abilities. When the two women worked together on \u201cLean In,\u201d Scovell was overjoyed to find an outlet for her frustration \u2014 finally, here was data to back up her sense of inequity! \u2014 and for the reader, that emotional shift comes not a moment too soon, as one thing that\u2019s sacrificed in her litany of miscreants is a larger sense of why she loves or even wants a career in entertainment anymore. \u201cRunning a show is like being beaten to death with your own dream,\u201d a producer she worked with on the series she created, \u201cSabrina the Teenage Witch,\u201d says.\n\nThere are career high points, too; I would have gladly read another chapter on the feminist platform presented by \u201cMurphy Brown.\u201d But through connections made at Facebook, \u201cLean In\u201d brings an even more rarefied opportunity: writing jokes for President Obama. Finally, the payoff! Scovell is understandably giddy at crafting one-liners for the White House Correspondents Dinner, to be delivered by the leader of the free world \u2014 a man who just happens to know how to land a punch line.\n\nThere\u2019s no time to wallow, now, in that era\u2019s ending; there\u2019s too much to fix. Though no doubt Scovell would have had it otherwise, the fact that \u201cJust the Funny Parts\u201d is landing at such a charged moment \u2014 when women are exquisitely, bruisingly fed up \u2014 may be a stroke of luck. In her introduction, Scovell does joke about calling the book \u201cJust the Angry and Bitter Parts,\u201d but says she hoped not to outright discourage young writers. Besides, she adds, \u201cthat would be an eight-volume set.\u201d", "keywords": ["parts", "writing", "nell", "funny", "comedy", "career", "insults", "lean", "book", "comeons", "takedowns", "write", "sandberg", "sense", "scovell", "woman"], "polarity": 0.19041092745638194, "subjectivity": 0.5106305635201738},

MacKinnon and Her Book \u2018Sexual Harassment of Working Women\u2019                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/books/review/metoo-workplace-sexual-harassment-catharine-mackinnon.html", "text": "Although the ritual itself has an incalculably long history, the term \u201csexual harassment\u201d has only been around since the mid-1970s, when activists at Cornell University coined it during a consciousness-raising session. It was MacKinnon\u2019s book, though dense and academic, that brought the idea broader attention, charting a course for the legal system to more effectively handle instances of harassment as cases of sex discrimination, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. As far back as the 19th century, women were occasionally able to reap monetary damages through the courts if men touched them inappropriately in public, but tort law was an inadequate means of addressing harassment claims, MacKinnon believed, because it personalized injuries that were inflicted socially and ecumenically.\n\nLawyers who had tried to apply the civil rights statute to these claims had largely failed, in part because courts struggled to process what was essentially discriminatory about a practice that could theoretically victimize anyone: How could you ever know that a woman was subject to harassment because she was a woman, rather than, say, an individual who happened to be female? MacKinnon\u2019s approach was rooted in the theory that sexual harassment realized and reiterated women\u2019s inequality, that it locked women into a kind of dependence and failure.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIt was not until seven years after the arrival of MacKinnon\u2019s book, though, that the Supreme Court recognized sexual harassment as a Title VII violation. The case was Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson and it had little nuance. In it a bank teller had charged that a company vice president had coerced her into having sex with him repeatedly, that he had touched her in public and raped her. Here the court ruled unanimously that harassment resulting in a hostile work environment was discriminatory and unlawful.\n\nIn a recent essay in The New York Times, MacKinnon celebrated the #MeToo movement, acknowledging that it was able to achieve what sexual harassment law, despite its sporadic victories, could not: a unified movement against an intractable brand of predation. Accusers were suddenly believed. Why the revolution finally got the reception it deserved has still not entirely been sorted out, but it seems clear that a war waged from the vantage point of legal theory was bound to have a harder time than a war waged from the modern media.\n\nThe 1970s and \u201980s witnessed various efforts to expose and address the dark and dangerous habits of American intimacy. Movements against domestic violence and child abuse, for example, had meaningful allies in popular culture. In 1984, \u201cThe Burning Bed,\u201d a television movie based on the true story of a Michigan housewife, Francine Hughes Wilson, who lit her husband on fire while he was sleeping, in retaliation for years of brutality, was viewed by 75 million people. The movie was crucial in transforming public understanding of spousal abuse: Shelters for battered women began opening around the country; the police began to take the issue more seriously; women who killed battering partners, and children who killed battering parents, were understood to be victims of a destructive syndrome that often gave them judicial reprieve.\n\nBest-selling thrillers like \u201cFlowers in the Attic\u201d and \u201cWhen the Bough Breaks\u201d took on child abuse and molestation, and by the 1990s we began to see the spread of community notification laws that required convicted sex offenders to register. The law followed in a sense what narrative awakened first.\n\nThe movement against sexual harassment had something else, however: a mass-market antagonist in the empire of Helen Gurley Brown and Cosmopolitan magazine, which preached a feminism of patriarchal compliance. Brown encouraged young women to work hard, build careers and run companies, but to accomplish it all by coddling the men they worked with and finding sexual freedom along the way. In \u201cSex and the Office,\u201d Brown\u2019s sequel to her loopy best-selling instructional \u201cSex and the Single Girl,\u201d she delivered a playbook for the way young women should understand male bosses that included lessons in making them feel godlike. Colleagues were potential sexual partners and the cubicle was Tinder: \u201cThough it may seem to the untrained eye that you are selflessly working on office projects together, what you are really doing is sinking into them like a cobalt treatment so that you may make off with them after work.\u201d\n\nThe book appeared in 1968 and in 2004 was reissued with an enthusiastic blurb from Donald Trump. In the 1990s, Brown\u2019s brand of feminism, dependent on the idea that women needed to work within the structures available to them, gained a new currency and held on for a long time. MacKinnon, of course, believed that the structure itself was the problem, a notion that for more than three decades has largely been received as benighted and fusty.

In \u201cJane Eyre,\u201d she wrote from the first-person perspective of a child, an innovation that gave voice and power even to the very young; she created, too, a heroine who was, like Bront\u00eb herself, plain, pale, small, and yet frankly desirous, as well as worthy of desire.\n\nBront\u00eb once wrote to a friend that she considered the marital ambitions of women of no means or beauty \u201can imbecility which I reject with contempt,\u201d a practical response to the frank injustices of class and a kind of sexism. In her novels, however, those same plain women are entitled to not just any marriages, but to passionate, loving ones. The interior lives of Jane Eyre and Lucy Snowe are shared in such detail that the characters\u2019 unfair burdens are plainly manifest; Bront\u00eb could make great sweeping plotlines of the small moments and humiliations in an unmarried woman\u2019s life. Lucy Snowe\u2019s struggle to find a private place to read a long-awaited letter reads, over several pages, with the suspense and drama of a Spenserian quest.\n\nA miniaturist of the soul, Bront\u00eb captured shades of emotion with a psychological subtlety that still feels exquisitely modern. When Lucy Snowe, battling depression, is advised to cultivate her own happiness, her strong response will feel familiar to many a 21st-century person who has the condition: \u201cNo mockery in this world ever sounds to me so hollow as that of being told to cultivate happiness,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHappiness is not a potato to be planted in mould and tilled with manure.\u201d\n\nShe had a mordant wit, which could protect her only so much from the series of losses that left her so fragile. \u201cIt is useless to tell you how I live,\u201d she wrote to a friend in 1851. \u201cI endure life \u2014 but whether I enjoy it or not is another question.\u201d She startled readily, and wrote to friends complaining of crushing insomnia, a poor appetite, grief and flashbacks; she put off writing letters for fear of how dejected she would feel if the replies came too slowly. Her two most intense romantic passions \u2014 one, involving a married Belgian school master, was meticulously memorialized in \u201cVillette\u201d; the other, for her publisher, George Smith (also captured in the characteristics of a doctor in \u201cVillette\u201d) \u2014 were both unrequited.\n\nBut reader, she married, eventually, at the age of 38, choosing Arthur Bell Nicholls, a pastor who worked for Bront\u00eb\u2019s father. Although she acknowledged frankly that he was not her intellectual equal, he pursued her persistently, and against her father\u2019s wishes, possibly imbuing a late-in-life courtship with a jolt of romance.\n\nDid Bront\u00eb ultimately find the kind of happiness that she described as \u201ca glory shining far down upon us out of heaven\u201d? In \u201cVillette,\u201d Lucy Snowe describes her own feelings about happiness: \u201cThe negation of severe suffering was the nearest approach to happiness I expected to know. Besides, I seemed to hold two lives \u2014 the life of thought, and that of reality. And provided the former was nourished with a sufficiency of strange and necromantic joys of fancy, the privileges of the latter might remain limited to daily bread, hourly work and a roof of shelter.\u201d Once Bront\u00eb married, however, her life of thought suffered. \u201cMy own life is more occupied than it used to be,\u201d she wrote to a friend. \u201cI have not so much time for thinking.\u201d\n\nLiterature would no longer be the business of her life; whether the pleasures of marriage could offset that loss remains unclear. To one friend, she wrote, \u201cIt is a solemn and strange and perilous thing for a woman to become a wife.\u201d But several months later, she wrote, \u201cI have a good, kind attached husband, and every day makes my own attachment to him stronger.\u201d", "keywords": ["eyre", "snowe", "novelist", "overlooked", "bront\u00eb", "friend", "jane", "women", "charlotte", "villette", "life", "married", "wrote", "lucy", "known", "happiness"], "polarity": 0.15464722412090828, "subjectivity": 0.4587040517961569},

It\u2019s not. Instead, she offers a persuasive examination of the innumerable institutionalized prejudices, roadblocks and often unconscious undermining that women face in nearly every aspect of public and private life. Some of her facts will be familiar to H.R. directors, women\u2019s studies scholars and reporters who cover gender equality. They will likely be revelatory to nearly everyone else. Lipman\u2019s not wrong that those with power are loath to give it up: One study by Catalyst, an organization devoted to working women, found that 74 percent of men surveyed on what undermines their support for gender equality said fear \u2014 of loss of status, of other men\u2019s disapproval and of making a mistake \u2014 all of which, Lipman writes, has men \u201cwalking around on eggshells.\u201d But she also believes that most men, certainly those in the upper echelons of management, \u201cdon\u2019t need beating up with a two-by-four. They\u2019d like to see an equitable workplace, they just can\u2019t figure out what they\u2019re supposed to do about it.\u201d She\u2019s here to tell them; here\u2019s hoping they\u2019re paying attention.\n\nPhoto\n\nLipman, a former journalist for The Wall Street Journal and the founding editor of the short-lived Cond\u00e9 Nast business magazine Portfolio, is a skilled assembler of data and a graceful storyteller. She starts with a sketch of just how male by default the universe is, from the standard office temperature (set to accommodate the higher metabolic rate of 40-year-old, 154-pound, suit-wearing men) and male-centric design at Apple (the iPhone 6 Plus was too big for many women\u2019s hands and pockets) to the potentially dangerous side effects for women of the original prescribed doses of Ambien, a drug that was tested only on men, a still-common practice. All due, in part, to the lack of women in decision-making roles across industries and sectors, which, the data clearly show, is a financial mistake.\n\nA lot of assertions in the book begin with \u201cstudies have shown\u201d\u2014 a suspicious tactic. (Was the study that found a new potion \u201celiminated every wrinkle in a week\u201d conducted with the 12 people who work at that beauty start-up? Or was it a double-blind, controlled trial by a credible research team?) Yet each fact here is carefully accounted for on the nearly 50 pages of notes at the end of the book. It\u2019s not necessarily persuasive to read that \u201cmultiple studies have found that adding women to all-male teams leads to greater financial success,\u201d but this claim is bolstered by data from several sources, including The Journal of Financial Economics (\u201cFemale executives make more profitable acquisitions and take on less debt than male executives\u201d), Catalyst (\u201cFirms with the most female board members outperform those with the least by almost every financial measure\u201d) and the Credit Suisse Research Institute (\u201cCompanies whose top management is at least half female post returns on equity that are 19 percent higher than average\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a chapter titled \u201cWe\u2019re All a Little Bit Sexist,\u201d Lipman walks us through the thicket of research on cultural biases against women, which start almost from birth: Mothers overestimate the crawling ability of sons and underestimate that of daughters. Parents are 2.5 times more likely to query Google about whether their 2-year-old is a genius if that 2-year-old is a boy. In one study, girls outscored boys on math tests when there were no names on the papers given to teachers to grade; on the same tests with names attached, the boys outscored the girls. Women are 33 percent more likely to earn a college degree than men, even though professors are more likely to call on the men. Women are also more likely to be interrupted, despite speaking less than their male classmates.\n\nIn the working world, well, it gets worse: A Carnegie Mellon University study found that when an equal number of job-seeking men and women visited 100 recruitment sites, men were shown the ad for the highest-paying job six times more often than women were. Lipman dismantles the so-called \u201cpipeline theory,\u201d which posits that when women enter the work force at the same rate as men, they will reach management positions in equal numbers. In the early 1990s, more than half of law-school students were women, so, according to the pipeline theory, by now 50 percent of partners at law firms should be women as well. But by 2013, women held just 17 percent of those jobs, a pattern that Lipman says holds steady across \u201cany\u201d industry.\n\nPhoto\n\nShe also debunks James Damore\u2019s argument that the lack of gender parity at Google (about 70 percent of its employees are male) is a failure of nature by citing the in-house experts the company assigned to fix the problem. She interviews Brian Welle, a Google data scientist, and Laszlo Bock, a former head of its People Operations, who began working on the issue in 2006 and who eventually determined that Google\u2019s employees \u201cclearly had blind spots about their own prejudices against women and minorities.\u201d (Google\u2019s famously elaborate hiring process, in which candidates are evaluated, primarily by men, for their \u201cGoogleyness\u201d \u2014 the qualities that made them likely to fit in at the company \u2014 presumably had something to do with this.)\n\nThe Google case study is among several Lipman uses to propel a narrative about the uncertain status of women in the workplace. She recounts how jealousy of the woman who built the Tupperware company into a household name in the 1950s drove its founder to fire her and write her out of the company\u2019s history, and she explains why Iceland is the only country in the world where men and women share power in almost equal numbers: After the global financial crisis of 2008, Icelanders embraced the idea that the bank failures were, as the female director of the country\u2019s Chamber of Commerce put it, the result of a \u201cpenis competition\u201d among bankers. Not only did Icelanders jail unscrupulous bankers but they also elected more women to government posts, including that of prime minister, and mandated that women make up 40 percent of corporate boards.\n\nLipman needs these stories to help give dimension to her statistics \u2014 though many women may find the statistics comforting all on their own, if only because they document an unease that many feel but can\u2019t name. For instance: Women are 15 percent less likely to get promoted than men, in part because men get promoted for \u201cpotential,\u201d while women get promoted for performance. And both men and women would rather work for a male boss \u2014 they\u2019d even take a lower salary to ensure it. The self-annihilating absurdity of this last fact underlies some of the more important insights in \u201cThat\u2019s What She Said,\u201d which have to do with the unconscious bias women seem to have against themselves. Women in academia spend more time than men revising papers, in part because they\u2019re reluctant to burden anyone with what they feel is subpar work but also because they\u2019re so much more sensitive to criticism and hope to eliminate the possibility of any. Women underestimate their abilities at the same rate that men overestimate theirs, and a woman\u2019s self-esteem is more closely tied to compliments and criticism from her boss, with praise being more meaningful to women than even a raise or a promotion.\n\nBut men have sensitivities too, and the shame of holding a lower-status job than a woman, particularly if that woman is a romantic partner, apparently runs deep. Lipman quotes two studies that hint at what men don\u2019t often admit, much less even know. One is a study of heterosexual, college-age couples, in which both parties were asked to take a test. When the women were told that their boyfriends had scored higher on the test than they had, the women were unfazed. When the men were told that their girlfriends had done better, their self-esteem plummeted. Yet it rose when they were told that their girlfriends had done poorly. The other study found that men who earned less money than their wives were more likely to cheat. And when Lipman quizzed male executives on what it was about working with women that flummoxed them most, the resounding consensus was a crying woman. When women cry, a man\u2019s testosterone drops, which makes him depressed. If he only knew that women typically don\u2019t cry at work because they\u2019re sad. According to the research Lipman cites, women cry in the office because they\u2019re angry.\n\nThere is much to recommend this book, especially now, when record numbers of women are organizing, preparing to run for office and demanding change. So it\u2019s a bit disheartening to get to the end with only a handful of paragraphs on sexual harassment. Lipman managed to fold in a reference to Harvey Weinstein, but if there\u2019s one thing missing, it\u2019s a consideration of how sexual harassment, and the perhaps less quantifiable issue of why men fear ascendant women, lead to the disparities that she documents so persuasively. She is optimistic that men are capable of acting not only out of self-interest \u2014 though it\u2019s true, more female colleagues will make them richer \u2014 but out of the same moral imperative that once led privileged white men to abolish slavery and to \u201cgive\u201d women the right to vote. Lipman offers 12 \u201ctips and takeaways\u201d for moving forward, one of which inspired her title. To address what we might call the \u201cacknowledgment gap,\u201d she exhorts those paying attention in a meeting to repeat a statement that a woman has already made, to ensure she\u2019s recognized for it. Like her other suggestions, it\u2019s a nice idea, one that\u2019s been circulating among working women for a while. It reinforces her conviction that we must be vigilant in matters large and small if we want to shift the culture.

There\u2019s no glamour in \u201cBrave,\u201d and very little joy; I\u2019ve never read anything that makes being a starlet sound so tedious and demeaning.\n\nBook Review Rose McGowan on \u2018Brave\u2019 McGowan talks about her new memoir, and Katie Kitamura discusses Tom Malmquist\u2019s new novel, \u201cIn Every Moment We Are Still Alive.\u201d Audio\n\nThe book hinges on McGowan\u2019s encounter with Weinstein, whom she refers to only as \u201cthe Monster.\u201d Here, for the first time, she tells the story of what he did to her. It\u2019s both disgusting and, if you\u2019ve followed the Weinstein coverage, very familiar. She was summoned to a morning meeting in the restaurant of an exclusive hotel in Park City, Utah. When she arrived, the restaurant\u2019s host directed her to Weinstein\u2019s suite, saying he was stuck on a call. \u201cI was certain we would be working together for many years to come, and we were here to plot out the grand arc of my career,\u201d McGowan writes.\n\nInstead, Weinstein pushed her into a room with a Jacuzzi and pulled off her clothes. \u201cI freeze, like a statue,\u201d she writes. As she describes it, he put her on the edge of the Jacuzzi, got in, and performed oral sex on her while masturbating. Her experience sounds similar to the one that the actress and director Asia Argento described to The New Yorker. Like Argento, McGowan says that she feigned pleasure in the hopes of bringing the event to a quicker conclusion. \u201cHe moans loudly; through my tears I see his semen floating on top of the bubbles,\u201d she writes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfterward, McGowan writes, she was taken to a photo-op with Ben Affleck, her co-star in \u201cPhantoms,\u201d a movie she was promoting. Seeing her shaken and hearing where she came from, the actor said, \u201cGoddamn it. I told him to stop doing that.\u201d (It\u2019s unclear what Affleck meant by that statement; he has never responded to the accusation that he knew about Weinstein\u2019s abuse.) Others, McGowan writes, \u201ccounseled me to see it as something that would help my career in the long run.\u201d Wanting to press charges, she spoke to a criminal attorney who told her she would never be believed.\n\nPhoto\n\nSoon she heard that Weinstein was calling around town telling people not to hire her. \u201cIt seemed like every creep in Hollywood knew about my most vulnerable and violated moment,\u201d she writes. \u201cAnd I was the one who was punished for it.\u201d Her film career was derailed.\n\nMcGowan would eventually find success playing one of a trio of witches on the TV show \u201cCharmed.\u201d She describes working on the show as a deadening experience, a \u201cprison for my mind.\u201d Her sense of martyrdom can be a bit much; she writes of feeling \u201crobbed\u201d by having to get married on TV before her real wedding. \u201cYour entertainment comes at a cost to us performers,\u201d McGowan writes. \u201cYou should know this and acknowledge.\u201d\n\nYet it\u2019s McGowan\u2019s profound dissatisfaction with her profession \u2014 one she seems to have fallen into rather than pursued \u2014 that has given her the freedom to gleefully burn bridges. She loathes the entertainment business, describing Hollywood as a cult worse than the one she grew up in. Though she\u2019s in her 40s, she sometimes writes with the grandiosity of an alienated adolescent whose mind was blown by \u201cThe Matrix.\u201d \u201cYou may think that what happens in Hollywood doesn\u2019t affect you,\u201d she writes. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. My darlings, who do you think is curating your reality?\u201d\n\nFor most adult readers, it won\u2019t be much of a revelation that Hollywood trades in distortion and exploitation. But I hope \u201cBrave\u201d finds its way into the hands of teenage girls who may still look to actresses as they try to figure out how they\u2019re supposed to be in the world, girls who aspire to the life McGowan once had. In the end, McGowan finds a measure of peace and redemption when she moves behind the camera, becoming a director and multimedia artist, subject rather than object.

The book takes digressive turns (long walks and talks about art abound) and structural liberties (some of the dialogue among Sheila and her friends, including her painter confidante, Margaux, appears in the form of a play) on the road to both self-discovery and the realization of \u201cthe true singularity\u201d of others.\n\nThe roads Chew-Bose follows in her slim collection of 14 visually and verbally astute essays lead inward. She narrates her discursive thoughts in a breathless torrent of thrillingly precise observations about everyday life (\u201cthe rubbery satisfaction of yanking a single blade of grass from its root\u201d) and minute reflections on cultural figures and their work, from the playwright Annie Baker to the Beastie Boys to Janet Jackson. The glow emanating from Chew-Bose\u2019s voracious curiosity and engagement with art and emotion illuminates not only her particularly searching mind at work, but also a new way of seeing the world.\n\nIn her books \u201cDon\u2019t Let Me Be Lonely,\u201d a vital collage of words and images from life and politics and television and death, and \u201cCitizen,\u201d a meditative and arresting distillation of racism in America, Claudia Rankine mixes the personal and the political.

Paper, $24.95.\n\nGwendolyn Elizabeth Brooks was born in Topeka, Kan., at 1 p.m. on Thursday, June 7, 1917.\n\nBut her family moved to Chicago shortly after her birth, and she was a Chicagoan until her death, in 2000. The author of more than 20 volumes of poetry, Brooks holds the distinction of being the first African-American to win a Pulitzer Prize (in 1950, for her second book of poems, \u201cAnnie Allen\u201d), and she received numerous accolades, including the National Medal of Arts and an American Academy of Arts and Letters Award. In honor of the centennial year of her birth, two anthologies have arrived: \u201cRevise the Psalm,\u201d edited by Quraysh Ali Lansana and Sandra Jackson-Opoku; and \u201cThe Golden Shovel Anthology,\u201d edited by Peter Kahn, Ravi Shankar and Patricia Smith.\n\nIn their shared mission, these books complement each other without too much overlap. The novelist Richard Wright, in a reader\u2019s report for Harper & Brothers in the early 1940s, declared Brooks essential: \u201cAmerica needs a voice like hers.\u201d Confirming Wright\u2019s claim are the hundreds of artists represented in these two new anthologies, poets who have used her work as a prompt or a point of engagement.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe Golden Shovel Anthology\u201d structures itself around the form developed by the prodigious poet Terrance Hayes, whose own poem \u201cThe Golden Shovel\u201d opens the book. A Golden Shovel poem sneaks an existing poem into the end words of each line. That way, the new poem always remains in conversation with its precursor. In his introduction, Shankar writes that the anthology is \u201can inherently collaborative effort, a dialogue, a response,\u201d and the same description works for Hayes\u2019s form, which unites all of the poems here. Read their end words, and you\u2019ll find a Brooks poem. In the foreword, Hayes says he came up with the idea when he was helping his 5-year-old son memorize Brooks\u2019s \u201cWe Real Cool,\u201d which starts with a sort of subtitle or epigraph: \u201cThe Pool Players. / Seven at the Golden Shovel.\u201d The words of Brooks\u2019s poem moved into Hayes\u2019s head space and became a lyric to push against or engage:\n\nWhen I am so small Da\u2019s sock covers my arm, we\n\ncruise at twilight until we find the place the real men lean, bloodshot and translucent with cool.\n\nHis smile is a gold-plated incantation as we drift by women on bar stools, with nothing left\n\nin them but approachlessness. This is a school I do not know yet. But the cue sticks mean we\n\nare rubbed by light, smooth as wood, the lurk of smoke thinned to song. We won\u2019t be out late.\n\nStanding in the middle of the street last night we watched the moonlit lawns and a neighbor strike\n\nhis son in the face. A shadow knocked straight Da promised to leave me everything: the shovel we\n\nused to bury the dog, the words he loved to sing his rusted pistol, his squeaky Bible, his sin.\n\nThe boy\u2019s sneakers were light on the road. We watched him run to us looking wounded and thin.\n\nHe\u2019d been caught lying or drinking his father\u2019s gin. He\u2019d been defending his ma, trying to be a man. We\n\nstood in the road, and my father talked about jazz, how sometimes a tune is born of outrage. By June\n\nthe boy would be locked upstate. That night we got down on our knees in my room. If I should die\n\nbefore I wake. Da said to me, it will be too soon.\n\nNestled into the last word of each line is Brooks\u2019s canonical poem: \u201cWe real cool. We/ Left school. \u2026\u201d Throughout this anthology, more than 60 other well-known Brooks poems can be read the same way, with lines from \u201cThe Mother\u201d and \u201cThe Bean Eaters\u201d tripping down the right-hand side of the page. The anthology ends with \u201cNon-Brooks Golden Shovels\u201d and \u201cVariations and Expansions on the Form.\u201d The cross-section of poets with varying poetics and styles gathered here is only one of the many admirable achievements of this volume.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cRevise the Psalm\u201d brings a more expansive response to Brooks. The editors have included poetry, prose, photographs and paintings created in recognition of both Brooks and her work. Essays speak back to individual poems like \u201cThe Mother,\u201d or reflect on Brooks\u2019s impact or on personal encounters with her. We get a keen sense of the poet and her fierce commitment to community engagement. For example, Adrian Matejka writes about attending a reading where Brooks spent more time reading poems by elementary school children than reading her own work.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Most notable is the author\u2019s photo by Roy Lewis, for her 1969 book \u201cRiot,\u201d with Brooks wearing the Afro that signified her break with her mainstream publisher as she joined the voices of the Black Arts Movement. Lansana and Jackson-Opoku, the editors of \u201cRevise the Psalm,\u201d use the phrase \u201c\u2018Gwendolynian\u2019 influences,\u201d describing their anthology as \u201ca project of literary and artistic revision, the process of \u2018talking back\u2019 to works that inspire, teach, challenge and engage.\u201d Not surprisingly, given this endeavor, the book includes some Golden Shovel poems.\n\nMore often than not, however, the poems in \u201cRevise the Psalm\u201d are more loosely inspired by Brooks\u2019s subjects. Consider \u201cDaystar,\u201d by Rita Dove. (She is one of a handful of poets who appear in both volumes.) Though written for Dove\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning book \u201cThomas and Beulah,\u201d \u201cDaystar\u201d takes on a subject that was of central importance to Brooks \u2014 the quotidian outer life and the rich inner life of African-American mothers:\n\nShe wanted a little room for thinking:\n\nbut she saw diapers steaming on the line,\n\na doll slumped behind the door.\n\nSo she lugged a chair behind the garage\n\nto sit out the children\u2019s naps. Sometimes there were things to watch:\n\nthe pinched armor of a vanished cricket,\n\na floating maple leaf. Other days\n\nshe stared until she was assured\n\nwhen she closed her eyes\n\nshe\u2019d see only her vivid own blood. She had an hour, at best, before Liza appeared\n\npouting from the top of the stairs.\n\nAnd just what was mother doing\n\nout back with the field mice? Why,\n\nbuilding a palace. Later\n\nthat night when Thomas rolled over and\n\nlurched into her, she would open her eyes\n\nand think of the place that was hers\n\nfor an hour \u2014 where\n\nshe was nothing,\n\npure nothing, in the middle of the day.\n\nWhether one considers the breadth of writing inspired by Gwendolyn Brooks or drops down into the possibilities of the Golden Shovel form, Richard Wright was not wrong about her importance: She has served her readers across a century.", "keywords": ["brookss", "legacy", "golden", "rankine", "brooks", "poem", "book", "claudia", "shovel", "words", "reading", "anthology", "gwendolyn", "poems"], "polarity": 0.1498792873792874, "subjectivity": 0.4314258045875693},

It seems to me few novels engage with motherhood, and those that do are dated, depressing or dystopian. I\u2019ve heard Margaret Atwood\u2019s \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d mentioned, especially with the Hulu adaptation, but that\u2019s about it. Are there any feminist writers who can articulate some positive experiences about being a mother? Given this may be the last time for a while I\u2019m able to read a book on more than three hours sleep, I really don\u2019t want to waste it on patronizing, preaching writing that leaves you despairing and enraged. There is enough of that in the American parenting genre.\n\nSOPHIE MOULLIN\n\nPRINCETON, N.J.\n\nDear Sophie,\n\nCongratulations! And don\u2019t worry \u2014 books about motherhood deepen in meaning after you\u2019ve had the chance to hold your own baby. What\u2019s more, you may not sleep much, but as the mother of a newborn you\u2019ll become \u2014 temporarily \u2014 a shut-in with time to sneak in a few paragraphs between baby-gazing sessions.\n\nParenting Memoirs by Grown-Ups\n\nYou asked for novels, but you could start with two novelists\u2019 memoirs whose episodic styles are ideally structured to spell you in the early, disorienting days of motherhood. Rivka Galchen\u2019s slim collection of observant fragments, \u201cLittle Labors,\u201d captures a view of the postpartum life of the mind. Short sections (fleetingly) cover subjects from the mundane to the esoteric. A petty, belittling neighbor, two books from the 11th century written by Japanese women, and accounts of babies in the classics: Galchen wryly examines small moments in literature and life with the fresh eyes of a new mother.\n\nPart of the pleasure of Galchen\u2019s book is its grown-up tone, skeptical and gently mocking. For balance, try Louise Erdrich\u2019s \u201cThe Blue Jay\u2019s Dance,\u201d which takes a more reverent, though grounded view of motherhood. Throughout her meditative memoir, which spans one year of pregnancy and early parenthood, Erdrich chafes very little under the demands of motherhood. Instead her vivid, sensitive writing tracks changes in the natural world and her deepening bond with her baby.\n\nSisterhood in Mother Land\n\nAri, the narrator of Elisa Albert\u2019s novel \u201cAfter Birth,\u201d is refreshingly profane. A first-time mother and mostly friendless graduate student who lives with her English professor husband in a rundown town in upstate New York, Ari articulates the physical and psychological demands, loneliness and the desperate love inherent in her new role with obscene, comforting honesty. When Mina Morris, a pregnant former punk rocker \u2014 a bass player for a girl band called the Misogynists \u2014 assumes a post as visiting poet in the local English department, a complicated, intimate friendship between the two women ignites.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Her nurse and contemporary, Franckline \u2014 also pregnant, but not visibly so \u2014 guides and cares for Lore through her delivery. Flashbacks between contractions fill in both women\u2019s back stories. But even when Lore\u2019s delivery becomes dangerously complicated, the two women\u2019s tangled, fascinating histories remain hidden from each other.\n\nOther Mothers\n\nIf all this child-rearing realism leaves you longing for an escape, consider Eowyn Ivey\u2019s \u201cThe Snow Child,\u201d her 2012 debut rooted in a Russian fairy tale. For a time near the start of the novel, a childless couple named Mabel and Jack \u2014 homesteaders in Alaska in the 1920s \u2014 believe, in a fever of magical thinking, that they have conjured a real girl from a child they built out of snow. The arrival of this dream daughter gives Mabel and Jack hope. But the real magic lies in the exquisite emotional suspense that stretches throughout this novel.\n\nA timely heartbreaker published earlier this year, \u201cLucky Boy,\u201d by Shanthi Sekaran, follows two mothers who love one boy. Eighteen-year-old Soli leaves behind her parents and their way of life in Mexico and heads for California. Rishi and Kavya live in Berkeley and long for a child. After Soli is arrested and detained by immigration agents, her son, Ignacio, is placed in foster care with Kavya and Rishi, who nurture him with abandon while Soli remains in detention desperately planning to reclaim her child. The emotions in the book are complex and wrenching, but \u201cLucky Boy\u201d is ultimately a hopeful story about fierce mother love.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMatch Book\n\nDo you need book recommendations?

Her fully imagined emotional and physical life connects with vivid sensory details (this book describes such intense smells!) and an emphasis on the power of stories to create a world that feels very real, despite the novel\u2019s wild, speculative elements.\n\nThe connections made in \u201cThe Passion,\u201d Jeanette Winterson\u2019s historical fairy tale published in 1987, are erotic and semi-supernatural. Set in Europe (mainly Venice) during the Napoleonic Wars, the book alternates between the narration of Henri, who wants to be a drummer in Napoleon\u2019s army, but ends up a cook, and Villanelle, the cross-dressing daughter of a Venetian boatman, born with webbed feet during a solar eclipse. Their narratives eventually weave together, passing in and out of magic and revealing how both characters are driven by lust and undone by love.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But what sets this moving and mysterious novel apart is Hunt\u2019s understanding of children and outcasts and those unfortunate characters who are both. The children in \u201cMr. Splitfoot\u201d \u2014 Ruth and her tormentor/savior, Nat \u2014 meet in a group home where, \u201cnew arrivals carve filthy words into their dry skin, aching for their absent mothers.\u201d Mothers, even absent ones, are the glue that fuses the two narratives into one journey.\n\nContrary to the dictates of their nature, vampires have thrived during their recent time in the sun. Their proliferation throughout popular culture takes nothing away from the magic of Karen Russell\u2019s short story collection \u201cVampires in the Lemon Grove.\u201d Not all of her stories feature the undead, though the weary fanged one in the title story has abundant charm and \u201ca tan that won\u2019t fade until I die (which I never will).\u201d Russell\u2019s command of the conventions of supernatural storytelling \u2014 which allows her to tweak the immortal and other supernatural forces \u2014 makes all her stories funny, poignant and profound.\n\nIn Kelly Link\u2019s short fiction anything is possible. A raucous birthday party on a spaceship, a child born without a shadow, and in \u201cOrigin Story\u201d \u2014 my favorite story in her collection \u201cGet in Trouble\u201d \u2014 there\u2019s even a defunct George Saunders-esque theme park based on \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d and a reference to \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer.\u201d In each of her fantastical tales, Link creates a new universe from scratch, complete with different laws of physics. From story to story, the styles and environments vary so widely that it takes me a page or two to adjust to each new atmosphere. The supernatural results are disorienting and dazzling, but Link\u2019s characters are so familiar and human \u2014 even when they are not \u2014 that it\u2019s easy to fall in love.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMatch Book\n\nNeed something to read?

She has spoken often about the pleasure she takes in fashion, and she is the face of Boots No7, a makeup brand.\n\nMs. Adichie has cultivated these two strands of her identity: the serious literary author and the fashion icon. In turn, she has been celebrated both by mainstream pop culture and the literati. She won a MacArthur fellowship in 2008, and her novel \u201cAmericanah\u201d won the 2013 National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction and was chosen as New York City\u2019s \u201cOne Book\u201d for 2017. Her 2012 TEDx talk, \u201cWe Should All Be Feminists,\u201d was sampled by Beyonc\u00e9 in her music, and excerpts appeared on T-shirts at Dior\u2019s Paris Fashion Week show last year. The pop and the literary threads are not opposites to her, and their merger is central to the way she presents her public self and her work.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very important that brilliant women step up and be hot babes,\u201d Ms. Adichie joked in a conversation with the author Zadie Smith in 2014.\n\nPhoto\n\nSo in the past few years, she has become something of a star, flourishing at the unlikely juncture of fiction writing and celebrity. Her position was on full display during her visit to New York, where she started her book tour last week. She took the stage in front of a sold-out crowd at Cooper Union, and there was \u201cthis kind of unanimous scream,\u201d said Robin Desser, a Knopf editor who has worked with Ms. Adichie for 12 years.\n\n\u201cI really have never seen anything like this,\u201d Ms. Desser said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve published people who are really popular.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe main proposition of \u201cDear Ijeawele\u201d is that feminism is a project that necessarily binds mothers and daughters, and that raising a daughter feminist has as much to do with what you tell yourself as what you tell her. Ms. Adichie\u2019s first of 15 suggestions places a mother\u2019s freedom and growth at the center of a daughter\u2019s feminist education.\n\n\u201cBe a full person,\u201d Ms. Adichie writes. \u201cMotherhood is a glorious gift, but do not define yourself solely by motherhood.\u201d\n\nThe book grew partly out of the desire of Ms. Adichie\u2019s friend, called Ijeawele in the text, to teach her daughter \u201cto take less of the nonsense\u201d that past generations faced. Ms. Adichie wrote her friend a letter in 2015 and published it on Facebook last year.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The responses she received made her even more sure that it was an important piece to write.\n\n\u201cEven friends of mine \u2014 people I love \u2014 wrote, \u2018why yes, we kind of agree, but why call it feminist? It\u2019s just common sense.\u2019 And I\u2019m like no, it\u2019s feminist,\u201d Ms. Adichie said. \u201cOr, oh it\u2019s just humanism. Or someone said, \u2018these are just democratic ideals.\u2019 And I thought, what? It\u2019s everything but to acknowledge the fact that gender is a problem.\u201d\n\nMs. Adichie wrote the letter before she was a parent, but now she has a 17-month-old daughter whom she is trying to raise as a feminist. She and her husband split their time between Nigeria, where she grew up, and the United States.\n\nMs. Adichie often comments on how race and gender play out in the United States, but her book does not tackle some of the meatier questions that have occupied the American feminist movement in recent years, most notably the role of transgender people.\n\nOn this book tour, after we spoke, Ms. Adichie made controversial comments suggesting that transgender women experience male privilege before they transition. For activists who have been grappling with these questions for years, the comments came across as ill-informed. Asked about them, Ms. Adichie suggested through a spokesman that people go to her Facebook page, where she has posted several responses, acknowledging that her comments \u201cupset many people, and I consider their concerns to be valid.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see how my saying that we should not conflate the gender experiences of trans women with that of women born female could appear as if I was suggesting that one experience is more important than the other. Or that the experiences of trans women are less valid than those of women born female,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI do not think so at all \u2014 I know that trans women can be vulnerable in ways that women born female are not.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Adichie has written about Hillary Clinton for The Atlantic and Michelle Obama in T: The New York Times Style Magazine, and last summer wrote a short story in The Times imagining Melania Trump\u2019s experience on the campaign trail. Although she was an enthusiastic Hillary Clinton supporter in the election, she sees Mrs. Trump as a sympathetic character.\n\n\u201cI think there is some misogyny in the way she\u2019s been characterized, and I think it\u2019s ugly,\u201d Ms. Adichie said. She becomes animated talking about the vitriol aimed at Mrs. Trump, in the same way she bristles when asked about how Mrs. Clinton was treated during the campaign. She is concerned with how society responds to powerful women across the political spectrum.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even like talking about it, because I get very upset,\u201d she said while describing the media\u2019s focus on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201clikability.\u201d (One of the suggestions in her book is for mothers to teach daughters to \u201creject likability.\u201d)\n\nMs. Adichie will not say what she\u2019s working on next \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m very superstitious\u201d \u2014 but continues to write and throw herself into her international speaking engagements. The satisfaction she takes in her work is at the heart of her proposal: To raise feminist daughters, mothers must take pleasure in their own achievements, follow both the challenges and delights of the work, and give themselves room to fail.

Oscar Pistorius, the double-amputee and sprinter from South Africa, competed in the 2012 Olympic Games. The International Association of Athletics Federations initially barred Pistorius from competing, saying Pistorius\u2019s blade prosthetics gave him an advantage.

But Kraus pointed to rule 222, which states that all equipment used in competitions must conform to F.I.S. regulations.

Everyone calls you gay when you\u2019re young: \u201cOh you skate, you\u2019re gay.\u201d You\u2019re like, \u201cNo I\u2019m not!\u201d But inside you\u2019re like, yes you are, you\u2019re very gay.\n\nHow do you try to go against it?\n\nFor me what was hard was I would have girlfriends and I was like, this isn\u2019t gross. So it was hard for me to kind of find a balance of am I gay or does everybody feel like this? I tried so hard to just not be that and not just be another clich\u00e9. You know, on the Olympic team, of all the skaters on it, I was the only one that was gay. Are there gay people in skating? Hell yeah there are.\n\n[READ MORE: The Secret Behind Adam Rippon\u2019s Abs]\n\nDo you have any permanent physical repercussions from skating?\n\nNo, just emotional. Yes, of course there\u2019s a few. I wake up every morning and twist my ankles and it sounds like a music box \u2014 clack clack clack clack clack.\n\nYou talked about eating issues and body image issues contributing to injuries \u2014 you\u2019re in a position now, especially during the Games, when there\u2019s so much scrutiny on your body, and you\u2019ve got a lot of thirst coming your way. I\u2019m wondering how you deal with all that scrutiny?\n\nBreaking my foot was sort of the best thing that ever happened, because I went to the Olympic Training Center and I sat down with a nutritionist and I told her, I know I\u2019m a mess and I know that I\u2019m doing something wrong. Now I\u2019m comfortable in my own skin. And it wasn\u2019t always that way. But you know, I like my body. Even though I haven\u2019t been to the gym in two weeks and I had a few trips to McDonald\u2019s when I was at the Olympic Village.\n\nBut you know, I\u2019m an athlete, I work really hard for the body I have and yes, there are always going to be people who are like, Oh you\u2019re too skinny or you\u2019re too heavy or your boobs look weird or whatever. This is the body that you have. Embrace it. It\u2019s so easy to be a commentator in anybody\u2019s life because everybody has a platform now. Everybody has a Twitter. Everybody has an Instagram so it\u2019s so easy to just say, \u201cYou\u2019re fat.\u201d\n\nPeople aren\u2019t saying you\u2019re fat.\n\nNo. Well. Because I\u2019m not fat right now. Not yet. So I think that what\u2019s important is that when you have body goals that you speak to somebody who\u2019s a professional. And that they tell you, \u201cThis is realistic.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re good at shaking off negativity and trolls. Do you see younger people struggling with that on social media?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMy advice to the young kids coming up is that there is way more positivity coming your way. Before you respond to a negative tweet or somebody who\u2019s just trying to be hateful, respond to five positive messages first. Once you are finished responding to those five, you realize that the one negative is just so not important, and you\u2019ve already lost interest in trying to be like, \u201cYou don\u2019t know me!\u201d It\u2019s just not important. They don\u2019t know you, and they obviously don\u2019t want to get to know you.\n\nHave you heard from athletes that are in the closet?\n\nI heard from a few athletes actually when I was in Korea, and they asked me about my experience. I think everyone\u2019s circumstance is a bit different. For me I found that I was a lot more confident in who I was after I came out publicly. When I was coming out, I read a lot about other people\u2019s coming-out stories. I really felt like they made it so normal and it wasn\u2019t a big deal and that their life still went on.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

I said, you know what, I want to be taken seriously and I don\u2019t want to come out as gay when I\u2019m skating terribly. You know they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, that was the kiss of death!\u201d So I worked really hard, because I felt like it was important \u2014 it gave my skating a greater purpose because it was not for me. And then I felt so liberated once I did it, because I was able to make music decisions, costume choices that I wanted to make.\n\n[READ MORE: Adam Rippon on Quiet Starvation in Men\u2019s Figure Skating]\n\nIn skating you have four minutes to show the world what you\u2019ve been working on your entire life. If you can\u2019t embrace who you are, how are you going to show a panel of judges or the world who you are in four minutes? I\u2019m just going to be me who loves trashy music and wants to skate in something that\u2019s kind of slutty. And just really have a good time throughout the whole competitive experience, because if you\u2019re not enjoying it, it\u2019s already a rough situation to be in. But if you\u2019re trying to be something else while going through something so pressure filled, there\u2019s almost no joy in the whole experience.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat kind of advertisers have been reaching out to you for endorsements? Were there surprises?\n\nThey\u2019ve all gone to my management team and I\u2019ll have a meeting with them when I get back. I think they\u2019re trying to not preoccupy me too much or throw me off. I\u2018ve been really surprised with the response I\u2019ve gotten from so many people and all of the opportunities that I have coming up. I hope I\u2019ll stick around for a while. I feel like in maybe a year or two, people will be like, \u201cAdam Rippon is so funny. And did you know that he went to the Olympics?\u201d And I kind of have a feeling that I\u2019ve used the Olympics to get myself to meet the world.\n\nIs the Olympic athletes\u2019 village really like a hotbed of sexual Tinder, Grindr, everything?\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. The condoms aren\u2019t special. The reason that they go through so many is because people like me take maybe 400 of them and I have little gift bags for my friends. They\u2019re just like Korean \u2014 it says latex condom, but in Korean. But you know what, when you\u2019re in a high-pressure situation and there\u2019s like beautiful people all around, yeah, emotions get going.\n\nBut as somebody who\u2019s 28, I\u2019m not about to find somebody, try to sneak around five different roommates, lock a door and go through all of that. I\u2019ll let young kids have this sexual camp experience here at the Olympics. I\u2019ll just sit back, I\u2019ll wait, and I\u2019ll figure it out when I get home.\n\nWhat was the last thing you Googled?\n\nThe last thing I Googled was \u201cBrandi Glanville throws wine in Eileen Davidson\u2019s face.\u201d", "keywords": ["youre", "gay", "somebody", "rippon", "famous", "ill", "body", "think", "adam", "dont", "really", "im", "know"], "polarity": 0.12526004088504084, "subjectivity": 0.5071697767720496},

The figure was a marked decrease from the 4.9 million viewers who watched the same matchup in the 2014 gold medal game at the 2014 Sochi Games, which was broadcast on NBC \u2014 though the 2014 final began at noon Eastern time, while this year\u2019s gold medal game began at 11 p.m.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nViewership for this year\u2019s Olympic men\u2019s tournament saw a similar decline. The United States men\u2019s eight-round shootout victory over Russia in the 2014 Sochi Games established a record at the time for a hockey game on NBCSN, with 4.1 million viewers. But a 5-1 United States victory over Slovakia this year drew only a third of that number, a sign that rosters without N.H.L. stars and late-night broadcast times were the most obvious things keeping N.H.L. players and coaches \u2014 and others \u2014 from tuning in.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Kim seized on Mr. Moon\u2019s peace overtures before the Olympics to send his sister, Kim Yo-jong, to the opening ceremony and a large contingent of cheerleaders and athletes to the Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.\n\nBut Mr. Moon also knows he must convince the Americans to give him a chance. In a sign of how hard that will be, and how deeply the United States and North Korea distrust each other, Mr. Pence, who was Washington\u2019s envoy to the opening ceremony, and Ms. Kim would not even look at each other despite being seated only a few feet apart.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Moon argued for a South Korean-brokered peace and for the United States-North Korea talks when he met with President Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, who arrived to attend the Games\u2019 closing ceremony. He told her he wanted to improve ties \u201cin parallel\u201d with efforts to denuclearize the North.\n\nAnalysts said that once the Olympics ended, Mr. Moon would be left to sort out how much of the North\u2019s so-called charm offensive, in which it refrained from provocations like missile tests, could last.\n\n\u201cSouth and North Korea used the Olympics to use each other,\u201d said Yoo Dong-ryul, director of the Korea Institute for Liberal Democracy in Seoul. \u201cThe South was desperate to ease tensions. The North wanted to soften its image and weaken international sanctions. Now comes the hard part for Moon, after the Olympics.\u201d\n\nWithout a solution to the nuclear issue, relations between the two Koreas \u201cwill eventually revert to the same crisis mode before the Olympics,\u201d Mr. Yoo said.\n\nPhoto\n\nSo far, Washington and Pyongyang seem unable to talk. The North Koreans, including Mr. Kim\u2019s sister, canceled a meeting with Mr. Pence in Pyeongchang after he refused to soften his criticisms of the North\u2019s weapons and human rights.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNorth Korea seeks to be accepted as a nuclear power and win economic concessions in return for not advancing its nuclear programs any further, analysts say. But the United States insists it will never enter any serious negotiations or ease sanctions until the North commits itself to nuclear disarmament.\n\nOver the weekend, Mr. Trump announced harsh new sanctions against North Korea and warned of tougher measures if the North fails to relinquish its nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe hard line out of Washington has stood in conspicuous contrast with the more conciliatory gestures from Seoul.\n\nDavid Straub, a former American diplomat who is now a fellow at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, said there were rising frustrations in Washington that Mr. Moon was \u201capparently working at cross purposes with the Trump administration\u2019s effort to apply \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 on North Korea.\u201d\n\nThis \u201ccould result in a serious clash of wills between the two allied leaders,\u201d Mr. Straub said. \u201cIf the Trump administration or the Moon administation does not change its fundamental position, the odds are increasing that relations between the two will worsen.\u201d\n\nMr. Moon, a dogged advocate of dialogue with the North, had spent the last year helplessly watching the Korean Peninsula edge toward active war, as the North test-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles and conducted its most powerful nuclear test, and Mr. Trump threatened to rain down \u201cfire and fury\u201d on North Korea.\n\nDesperate to avoid a possible military conflict, Mr. Moon seized upon the Pyeongchang Games to craft what some analysts called an \u201cOlympic truce.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The first step, according to these officials, is for the administration to settle on a more consistent message toward North Korea.\n\nThe United States has veered in recent weeks from expressing openness to diplomacy to reiterating threats of military action if the North does not curb its nuclear and missile programs. The net effect, according to analysts, has been to confuse both North and South Korea.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhite House officials will also have to decide how to react if the inter-Korean diplomacy accelerates. The Trump administration is determined not to make undue concessions to North Korea, a mistake it says both Democratic and Republican presidents have made. On the other hand, if the United States takes too hard a position, analysts said it could prompt Mr. Moon to conclude that the Americans will never come around.\n\nThat could prompt Mr. Moon to set off on his own, isolating the United States by driving away one of its most important allies in Asia, which could end up drifting closer to China.\n\n\u201cOnce the ball gets rolling, it\u2019s very hard to stop, in large part because Seoul and Beijing want talks so badly,\u201d said Evan S. Medeiros, a managing director at Eurasia Group who was a senior Asia adviser to President Barack Obama.\n\nAnalysts said Mr. Moon was trying to get that forward momentum by seizing on this chance to move the peninsula toward peace with South Korea in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\n\u201cMoon Jae-in is not a na\u00efve waif,\u201d said Gordon Flake, the chief executive of the Perth USAsia Center at the University of Western Australia. \u201cThe South Koreans are desperately seeking to change the trajectory, which was leading to a conflict, and at the same time to do that while not giving too much space between them and the United States.\u201d\n\nFor both the Trump and Moon administrations, the first big test will be what to do about joint United States-South Korean military exercises that were postponed during the Olympics and the Paralympics, which will take place from March 9 to 18.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNorth Korea has indicated that it will restart weapons tests if the drills resume, scuttling Mr. Moon\u2019s efforts to broker a peace.\n\nConservatives in both South Korea and the United States fear that anything less than the full resumption of the war games would only advance the North\u2019s ultimate goal of ridding the peninsula of the American military presence, which they say the South needs for protection.\n\nBut progressive South Koreans who support Mr. Moon would most likely see a push by Washington to resume the exercises as \u201cthrowing cold water over the South\u2019s Olympic party,\u201d and as an effort to derail Mr. Moon\u2019s push for inter-Korean rapprochement, said Lee Byong-chul, senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul.\n\nSouth Koreans who attended Olympic events were cautious about how much the Olympic diplomacy could accomplish.\n\nYeon Ju-lee, 21, who recently watched a joint Korean team in women\u2019s ice hockey, said she felt relieved that the North\u2019s participation in the Olympics was easing fears of possible war. But, she said, actual political unification \u201cwill take a long time.\u201d\n\nAnother spectator, Lee Hae-man, 62, said recent developments were promising \u201cbecause we are all one family together, North and South.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will feel very betrayed if Kim Jong-un goes back to missile tests,\u201d he added.", "keywords": ["south", "north", "nuclear", "peace", "leader", "lasting", "mr", "moon", "trump", "olympics", "olympic", "turn", "koreas", "korea", "states", "truce", "united"], "polarity": 0.007703070931226276, "subjectivity": 0.39912877036663447},

They had their best Winter Olympics performance ever \u2014 winning 29 medals in total, 11 gold. You\u2019ll notice less athletes in the closing ceremony than you did in the opening ceremony. Many athletes \u2014 and most of the biggest name athletes \u2014 travel back home after their events. But the last event of the Olympics concluded just 3 hours before the closing ceremony.

Both sets of grandparents have also provided extensive caregiving during the racing season.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe made this deal where I wanted to be as much a part of the team as I could, but I didn\u2019t want to be disruptive to the athletes,\u201d Randall said. \u201cKids bring extra germs, and he might be crying at night.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter talking with the coaches, her family adopted ground rules \u2014 sitting at separate tables in the dining hall to allow the athletes to decide how much or how little they wanted to interact with the baby. Randall and her family stayed in separate quarters, but sometimes those rooms were still within earshot of teammates, creating extra worry about whether a crying baby might wake someone up.\n\nThere were bumps in the road. It took a month for Breck to adjust to the time difference in Europe, resulting in multiple wake-ups at night. And it was also a challenge to be on the road with a growing baby. \u201cThere was a lot of gear,\u201d Randall said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That part I hadn\u2019t anticipated,\u201d she said.\n\nHer teammate Diggins said the cross-country team knew that having a baby along during training and competition wouldn\u2019t always be ideal. Sometimes the Americans stayed in small hotels with thin walls, and team members would hear Breck crying in the middle of the night or when they were trying to nap, she said, speaking last fall at an event in Park City, Utah.\n\nBut Diggins said the team didn\u2019t want Randall to have to choose between being a mother and being a world-class skier, and they wanted to help her create something approaching a work-life balance. \u201cWomen shouldn\u2019t have to choose,\u201d Diggins said. \u201cThis team only works when everyone buys in.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd there were benefits to having Breck along for the ride, said Sadie Bjornsen, another team member. Bjornsen, who calls herself a \u201csucker for kids,\u201d said playing with Breck on the road helped keep her from thinking about skiing every waking hour.\n\n\u201cSometimes I will come in after a race and be bummed out about how I\u2019ve done, and I\u2019ll just go over and hug Breck, and it will make me feel better,\u201d she said.\n\nRandall, who plans to retire after this Olympics, recently won election to the International Olympic Committee Athletes\u2019 Commission. She hopes she can use her experience as a mother and an athlete to help other Olympic families.\n\nIn the end, she did not bring her son to the Olympics because the cost was so prohibitive. Instead, Breck stayed in Toronto with her husband\u2019s parents, and the separation was painful, said Randall. She said she wanted to work with the I.O.C. to create affordable housing for family members at future Olympics.\n\nShe hopes that seeing women like herself and Bjorgen on the Olympic podium will convince a new generation of athletes that it doesn\u2019t have to choose between an Olympic medal and motherhood. In fact, she asserted, the two can work well together. She recalled sharing a moment with Bjorgen when they were each presented a stuffed white Soohorang tiger, the Olympic mascot, during the podium ceremony.

In the women\u2019s downhill, Alice McKennis was fifth and Breezy Johnson was seventh. Over all, if you add their teammates Laurenne Ross and Alice Merryweather, there were seven top 20 finishes at the Pyeongchang Olympics by American women not named Vonn or Shiffrin.\n\nAnd another top woman on the United States team, Jacqueline Wiles, missed these Winter Games when she was injured in a heartbreaking crash on the final weekend of racing before the 2018 Olympics were to start. Wiles was third in a World Cup downhill late last month.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut on the men\u2019s side, things were more bleak. Perhaps symbolically, Ted Ligety, one of three Americans to win two Alpine gold medals, watched his Olympic career probably come to a close with a disappointing 15th in his signature event, the giant slalom. Days earlier, Ligety had the highest finish by an American man at the Pyeongchang Games when he was fifth in the Alpine combined. The American men\u2019s team was without one of its top performers in Travis Ganong, who is injured. The 36-year-old veteran Steven Nyman was also sidelined.\n\nStill, Ligety\u2019s fifth place was the only top 10 result by an American man here. That\u2019s a long way from the eight medals the Olympic men\u2019s team won at the 2010 Vancouver Games.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have all cylinders firing, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t turn it around in a two- to four-year cycle,\u201d said Tiger Shaw, the chief executive of U.S. Ski and Snowboard, the umbrella group overseeing the ski team. \u201cWe have a lot of young talent.

Ryan Cochran-Siegle, who is the son of the 1972 American Olympic gold medalist Barbara Cochran, had the third fastest time in the field in the second run of the giant slalom. Cochran-Siegle was participating in his first Olympics, and finished 11th, but even one blistering run on a big stage can propel a budding career. Cochran-Siegle was also 14th in the super-G.\n\nBryce Bennett, another Olympic rookie and an intriguing prospect because he is 6 feet 7 inches, was 16th in the downhill and 17th in the Alpine combined.

Included in that group is River Radamus, the son of two high-level, Colorado-based, ski racing coaches. Radamus, 19, has been near the top of the overall standings on what amounts to ski racing\u2019s minor league circuit for most of this winter. In 2017, at the Youth Olympic Games, Radamus won three races, which was unprecedented at the event.\n\nTwo years older than Radamus is his teammate Sam Morse, who won the downhill at the junior world championships last year (Merryweather won the women\u2019s downhill).\n\nMorse, raised in Maine, not only believes better days are coming for the American men, he believes the new wave of racers will introduce pioneering techniques because it is the first generation to have spent its entire upbringing using shaped skis, which, because of their parabolic silhouettes, are easier to turn.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different style coming up, more arcing of turns and less sliding,\u201d Morse said late last year.\n\nMorse added: \u201cAnd when we come up, it won\u2019t just be one or two fast guys but a whole squad.\u201d\n\nIf so, Shiffrin will appreciate the reinforcements.", "keywords": ["mikaela", "lonely", "radamus", "moment", "team", "looking", "shiffrin", "won", "olympics", "downhill", "olympic", "little", "american", "racing", "ski"], "polarity": 0.10282756132756134, "subjectivity": 0.38639610389610385},

But Kraus pointed to rule 222, which states that all equipment used in competitions must conform to F.I.S. regulations.

Now I\u2019m comfortable in my own skin. And it wasn\u2019t always that way. But you know, I like my body. Even though I haven\u2019t been to the gym in two weeks and I had a few trips to McDonald\u2019s when I was at the Olympic Village.\n\nBut you know, I\u2019m an athlete, I work really hard for the body I have and yes, there are always going to be people who are like, Oh you\u2019re too skinny or you\u2019re too heavy or your boobs look weird or whatever. This is the body that you have. Embrace it. It\u2019s so easy to be a commentator in anybody\u2019s life because everybody has a platform now. Everybody has a Twitter. Everybody has an Instagram so it\u2019s so easy to just say, \u201cYou\u2019re fat.\u201d\n\nPeople aren\u2019t saying you\u2019re fat.\n\nNo. Well. Because I\u2019m not fat right now. Not yet. So I think that what\u2019s important is that when you have body goals that you speak to somebody who\u2019s a professional. And that they tell you, \u201cThis is realistic.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re good at shaking off negativity and trolls. Do you see younger people struggling with that on social media?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMy advice to the young kids coming up is that there is way more positivity coming your way. Before you respond to a negative tweet or somebody who\u2019s just trying to be hateful, respond to five positive messages first. Once you are finished responding to those five, you realize that the one negative is just so not important, and you\u2019ve already lost interest in trying to be like, \u201cYou don\u2019t know me!\u201d It\u2019s just not important. They don\u2019t know you, and they obviously don\u2019t want to get to know you.\n\nHave you heard from athletes that are in the closet?\n\nI heard from a few athletes actually when I was in Korea, and they asked me about my experience. I think everyone\u2019s circumstance is a bit different. For me I found that I was a lot more confident in who I was after I came out publicly. When I was coming out, I read a lot about other people\u2019s coming-out stories. I really felt like they made it so normal and it wasn\u2019t a big deal and that their life still went on.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

I said, you know what, I want to be taken seriously and I don\u2019t want to come out as gay when I\u2019m skating terribly. You know they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, that was the kiss of death!\u201d So I worked really hard, because I felt like it was important \u2014 it gave my skating a greater purpose because it was not for me. And then I felt so liberated once I did it, because I was able to make music decisions, costume choices that I wanted to make.\n\n[READ MORE: Adam Rippon on Quiet Starvation in Men\u2019s Figure Skating]\n\nIn skating you have four minutes to show the world what you\u2019ve been working on your entire life.

I\u2019m just going to be me who loves trashy music and wants to skate in something that\u2019s kind of slutty. And just really have a good time throughout the whole competitive experience, because if you\u2019re not enjoying it, it\u2019s already a rough situation to be in. But if you\u2019re trying to be something else while going through something so pressure filled, there\u2019s almost no joy in the whole experience.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat kind of advertisers have been reaching out to you for endorsements? Were there surprises?\n\nThey\u2019ve all gone to my management team and I\u2019ll have a meeting with them when I get back. I think they\u2019re trying to not preoccupy me too much or throw me off. I\u2018ve been really surprised with the response I\u2019ve gotten from so many people and all of the opportunities that I have coming up. I hope I\u2019ll stick around for a while. I feel like in maybe a year or two, people will be like, \u201cAdam Rippon is so funny. And did you know that he went to the Olympics?\u201d And I kind of have a feeling that I\u2019ve used the Olympics to get myself to meet the world.\n\nIs the Olympic athletes\u2019 village really like a hotbed of sexual Tinder, Grindr, everything?\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. The condoms aren\u2019t special. The reason that they go through so many is because people like me take maybe 400 of them and I have little gift bags for my friends. They\u2019re just like Korean \u2014 it says latex condom, but in Korean. But you know what, when you\u2019re in a high-pressure situation and there\u2019s like beautiful people all around, yeah, emotions get going.\n\nBut as somebody who\u2019s 28, I\u2019m not about to find somebody, try to sneak around five different roommates, lock a door and go through all of that. I\u2019ll let young kids have this sexual camp experience here at the Olympics.

Mr. Kim seized on Mr. Moon\u2019s peace overtures before the Olympics to send his sister, Kim Yo-jong, to the opening ceremony and a large contingent of cheerleaders and athletes to the Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.\n\nBut Mr. Moon also knows he must convince the Americans to give him a chance. In a sign of how hard that will be, and how deeply the United States and North Korea distrust each other, Mr. Pence, who was Washington\u2019s envoy to the opening ceremony, and Ms. Kim would not even look at each other despite being seated only a few feet apart.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Moon argued for a South Korean-brokered peace and for the United States-North Korea talks when he met with President Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, who arrived to attend the Games\u2019 closing ceremony. He told her he wanted to improve ties \u201cin parallel\u201d with efforts to denuclearize the North.\n\nAnalysts said that once the Olympics ended, Mr. Moon would be left to sort out how much of the North\u2019s so-called charm offensive, in which it refrained from provocations like missile tests, could last.\n\n\u201cSouth and North Korea used the Olympics to use each other,\u201d said Yoo Dong-ryul, director of the Korea Institute for Liberal Democracy in Seoul. \u201cThe South was desperate to ease tensions. The North wanted to soften its image and weaken international sanctions. Now comes the hard part for Moon, after the Olympics.\u201d\n\nWithout a solution to the nuclear issue, relations between the two Koreas \u201cwill eventually revert to the same crisis mode before the Olympics,\u201d Mr. Yoo said.\n\nPhoto\n\nSo far, Washington and Pyongyang seem unable to talk. The North Koreans, including Mr. Kim\u2019s sister, canceled a meeting with Mr. Pence in Pyeongchang after he refused to soften his criticisms of the North\u2019s weapons and human rights.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNorth Korea seeks to be accepted as a nuclear power and win economic concessions in return for not advancing its nuclear programs any further, analysts say. But the United States insists it will never enter any serious negotiations or ease sanctions until the North commits itself to nuclear disarmament.\n\nOver the weekend, Mr. Trump announced harsh new sanctions against North Korea and warned of tougher measures if the North fails to relinquish its nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe hard line out of Washington has stood in conspicuous contrast with the more conciliatory gestures from Seoul.\n\nDavid Straub, a former American diplomat who is now a fellow at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, said there were rising frustrations in Washington that Mr. Moon was \u201capparently working at cross purposes with the Trump administration\u2019s effort to apply \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 on North Korea.\u201d\n\nThis \u201ccould result in a serious clash of wills between the two allied leaders,\u201d Mr. Straub said. \u201cIf the Trump administration or the Moon administation does not change its fundamental position, the odds are increasing that relations between the two will worsen.\u201d\n\nMr. Moon, a dogged advocate of dialogue with the North, had spent the last year helplessly watching the Korean Peninsula edge toward active war, as the North test-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles and conducted its most powerful nuclear test, and Mr. Trump threatened to rain down \u201cfire and fury\u201d on North Korea.\n\nDesperate to avoid a possible military conflict, Mr. Moon seized upon the Pyeongchang Games to craft what some analysts called an \u201cOlympic truce.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The first step, according to these officials, is for the administration to settle on a more consistent message toward North Korea.\n\nThe United States has veered in recent weeks from expressing openness to diplomacy to reiterating threats of military action if the North does not curb its nuclear and missile programs. The net effect, according to analysts, has been to confuse both North and South Korea.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhite House officials will also have to decide how to react if the inter-Korean diplomacy accelerates. The Trump administration is determined not to make undue concessions to North Korea, a mistake it says both Democratic and Republican presidents have made. On the other hand, if the United States takes too hard a position, analysts said it could prompt Mr. Moon to conclude that the Americans will never come around.\n\nThat could prompt Mr. Moon to set off on his own, isolating the United States by driving away one of its most important allies in Asia, which could end up drifting closer to China.\n\n\u201cOnce the ball gets rolling, it\u2019s very hard to stop, in large part because Seoul and Beijing want talks so badly,\u201d said Evan S. Medeiros, a managing director at Eurasia Group who was a senior Asia adviser to President Barack Obama.\n\nAnalysts said Mr. Moon was trying to get that forward momentum by seizing on this chance to move the peninsula toward peace with South Korea in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\n\u201cMoon Jae-in is not a na\u00efve waif,\u201d said Gordon Flake, the chief executive of the Perth USAsia Center at the University of Western Australia. \u201cThe South Koreans are desperately seeking to change the trajectory, which was leading to a conflict, and at the same time to do that while not giving too much space between them and the United States.\u201d\n\nFor both the Trump and Moon administrations, the first big test will be what to do about joint United States-South Korean military exercises that were postponed during the Olympics and the Paralympics, which will take place from March 9 to 18.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNorth Korea has indicated that it will restart weapons tests if the drills resume, scuttling Mr. Moon\u2019s efforts to broker a peace.\n\nConservatives in both South Korea and the United States fear that anything less than the full resumption of the war games would only advance the North\u2019s ultimate goal of ridding the peninsula of the American military presence, which they say the South needs for protection.\n\nBut progressive South Koreans who support Mr. Moon would most likely see a push by Washington to resume the exercises as \u201cthrowing cold water over the South\u2019s Olympic party,\u201d and as an effort to derail Mr. Moon\u2019s push for inter-Korean rapprochement, said Lee Byong-chul, senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul.\n\nSouth Koreans who attended Olympic events were cautious about how much the Olympic diplomacy could accomplish.\n\nYeon Ju-lee, 21, who recently watched a joint Korean team in women\u2019s ice hockey, said she felt relieved that the North\u2019s participation in the Olympics was easing fears of possible war.

They had their best Winter Olympics performance ever \u2014 winning 29 medals in total, 11 gold. You\u2019ll notice less athletes in the closing ceremony than you did in the opening ceremony. Many athletes \u2014 and most of the biggest name athletes \u2014 travel back home after their events. But the last event of the Olympics concluded just 3 hours before the closing ceremony.

Randall and Finland\u2019s Aino-Kaisa Saarinen were able to get federation officials to provide credentials for caregivers and to find space for baby rooms \u2014 stocked with diapers and toys \u2014 that doubled as a warm place for children and the people watching over them during long events.\n\n\u201cMen can have families, and they don\u2019t ever have to miss a single race,\u201d said Randall, who has pink highlights in her blond hair and is as ripped as a ninja warrior. \u201cKnowing we were all having babies, we lobbied to have some support for moms that first season back. It\u2019s the first time the international federation has provided that kind of support.\u201d\n\nWhile those changes helped, all of the other mothers lived in Europe and didn\u2019t face the same challenges Randall did in packing up her family and traveling for six months out of the year. For Randall, the only way to make the ski season successful as both an athlete and a parent was to enlist the support of her teammates.\n\nTheir buy-in was never in doubt. Randall has long been at the elite level of cross-country skiing, and several of her current teammates idolized her when they were teenagers. The goal was for Randall to spend time training with the team and still be there for her family. It helped that her husband, Jeff Ellis, a former Canadian ski racer, worked as a media coordinator for the International Ski Federation. Both sets of grandparents have also provided extensive caregiving during the racing season.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe made this deal where I wanted to be as much a part of the team as I could, but I didn\u2019t want to be disruptive to the athletes,\u201d Randall said. \u201cKids bring extra germs, and he might be crying at night.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter talking with the coaches, her family adopted ground rules \u2014 sitting at separate tables in the dining hall to allow the athletes to decide how much or how little they wanted to interact with the baby.

In the women\u2019s downhill, Alice McKennis was fifth and Breezy Johnson was seventh. Over all, if you add their teammates Laurenne Ross and Alice Merryweather, there were seven top 20 finishes at the Pyeongchang Olympics by American women not named Vonn or Shiffrin.\n\nAnd another top woman on the United States team, Jacqueline Wiles, missed these Winter Games when she was injured in a heartbreaking crash on the final weekend of racing before the 2018 Olympics were to start. Wiles was third in a World Cup downhill late last month.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut on the men\u2019s side, things were more bleak. Perhaps symbolically, Ted Ligety, one of three Americans to win two Alpine gold medals, watched his Olympic career probably come to a close with a disappointing 15th in his signature event, the giant slalom. Days earlier, Ligety had the highest finish by an American man at the Pyeongchang Games when he was fifth in the Alpine combined. The American men\u2019s team was without one of its top performers in Travis Ganong, who is injured. The 36-year-old veteran Steven Nyman was also sidelined.\n\nStill, Ligety\u2019s fifth place was the only top 10 result by an American man here. That\u2019s a long way from the eight medals the Olympic men\u2019s team won at the 2010 Vancouver Games.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have all cylinders firing, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t turn it around in a two- to four-year cycle,\u201d said Tiger Shaw, the chief executive of U.S. Ski and Snowboard, the umbrella group overseeing the ski team. \u201cWe have a lot of young talent.

Ryan Cochran-Siegle, who is the son of the 1972 American Olympic gold medalist Barbara Cochran, had the third fastest time in the field in the second run of the giant slalom. Cochran-Siegle was participating in his first Olympics, and finished 11th, but even one blistering run on a big stage can propel a budding career. Cochran-Siegle was also 14th in the super-G.\n\nBryce Bennett, another Olympic rookie and an intriguing prospect because he is 6 feet 7 inches, was 16th in the downhill and 17th in the Alpine combined.

Radamus, 19, has been near the top of the overall standings on what amounts to ski racing\u2019s minor league circuit for most of this winter.

South Korea built a competitive curling program before the Olympics, but the sport\u2019s popularity is not particularly widespread here. Fans cheer a lot, but sometimes for poor shots. In any case, the South Korean women\u2019s team is a medal contender and proved as much by upsetting Canada in its opening match of the tournament.\n\nIt was a bittersweet, if mostly bitter, result for Canadian fans: Peter Gallant, South Korea\u2019s coach, is from Prince Edward Island.\n\nIs Canada still the team to beat in men\u2019s hockey even without current N.H.L. players on its team?\n\nPhoto\n\nThe men\u2019s hockey draw seems like a total tossup. Traditional powerhouses like the United States and Russia \u2014 or the team that used to be known as Russia \u2014 lost their opening matches. Canada defeated Switzerland in its first match of the tournament in front of a mostly empty house at Gangneung Ice Arena.\n\nWithout the star power that N.H.L. players delivered at previous Olympics, the tournament is struggling to attract many eyeballs. Teams have filled their rosters with players who are toiling away in lesser leagues or are at the end of their career \u2014 and that includes Canada, which went with older players while leaving younger prospects at home.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe result is that chemistry will need to be built on the fly, and nobody seems too sure how this tournament will pan out.

But, right now at least, you can only experience the full effect by using an iPhone 6S, SE or newer. For the Olympics, we\u2019ve used the technology to take a unique look at four athletes.

I\u2019m also the household\u2019s wax technician. But the grumbling I hear when I get the wax wrong is nothing compared with what Knut Nystad experiences. David Segal reported that Mr. Nystad, the chief of Norway\u2019s 30-strong crew of Olympic wax techs, becomes public enemy No. 1 back home when his team messes up.\n\nCross-country skiing is to Norway what hockey is to Canada. Mr. Segal looked into Norway\u2019s equivalent of Sept. 28, 1972. (For non-Canadian readers: that\u2019s the day that Paul Henderson scored the winning goal against the Russians in the Summit series.) In this case, the defining moment was the breaking of Oddvar Bra\u2019s ski pole at 1:54 p.m. on Feb. 25, 1982, which became the stuff of national legend in Norway.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u2014Here\u2019s the diet of Adam Rippon, an American figure skater, from two years ago: three slices of whole grain bread topped with pats of I Can\u2019t Believe It\u2019s Not Butter spread, supplemented by three cups of coffee, each laced with six packets of artificial sweetener.

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/world/asia/north-koreans-olympics.html", "text": "More broadly, analysts and officials wonder if engaging with the outside world could have a political effect back home.\n\nPhoto\n\nThose scuffling for information find only scraps. The North Korean figure skaters seemed to enjoy a variety of global food in the athletes\u2019 cafeteria, said Kam Alex Kang Chan, a South Korean skater who also trained with Mr. Marcotte.\n\nMegan Duhamel, who with her skating partner, Eric Radford, won a bronze medal in pairs figure skating and is married to Mr. Marcotte, said that the North Korean skaters became fans of protein bars made by a friend of hers in Montreal, and that she gave them several to take home.\n\nIn the locker room before a game between the unified Korean women\u2019s ice hockey team and Sweden, some of the South Koreans taught their teammates from the North how to dance to K-pop music, said Sarah Murray, the Korean women\u2019s hockey coach.\n\nThe subtext of some of the curiosity is whether the North Koreans, exposed to glimpses of popular culture or the higher standard of living in the South, might be tempted to defect, as athletes from other Communist countries have done at previous Olympic Games. No North Korean athletes have defected during an Olympics, although one defected in 1991 during a world judo championship in Spain.\n\nSome analysts theorize that exposure to the outside world could eventually drive change back home.\n\n\u201cIt might be better to think that an information inflow will slowly alter the preferences of North Koreans by inevitably poking holes in the ideology,\u201d said Robert E. Kelly, a professor of political science at Pusan National University in South Korea. \u201cOver time, this should change the regime and make it easier to deal. That\u2019s the hope anyway.\u201d\n\nSome American officials espouse a version of this view. \u201cOur sense is the more North Koreans that come here and can see how successful the South has been, the better,\u201d Marc Knapper, the deputy chief of mission at the United States Embassy in Seoul, said during a news conference before the Games.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019ll discover what good things accrue when they decide to rejoin the international community and make the right decisions,\u201d Mr. Knapper added.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet even North Korea watchers who support greater athletic and cultural exchanges say none of it will slow down the country\u2019s nuclear ambitions.\n\n\u201cOf course they will proceed with their nuclear program,\u201d said Andrei Lankov, a North Korea expert at Kookmin University in Seoul. \u201cNothing can be done, short of a military invasion, to reverse it. The best we can hope for is to achieve some kind of freeze.\u201d\n\nAny North Korean who might try to steer the government in a new direction risks severe punishment. Dissidents are thrown into prison camps, and Kim Jong-un has had hundreds of people killed, including his own uncle, and, it is widely believed, his half brother.\n\nCritics say countries hosting North Koreans become susceptible to propaganda designed to soften the North\u2019s image. They point to the regime\u2019s charm offensive at the Olympics, including a visit by Kim Yo-jong, Kim Jong-un\u2019s sister.\n\n\u201cWhile North Korea, the target of engagement, remains a menacing nuclear state, the outsiders have become beholden to the enchanting possibility of their efforts bearing fruit one day,\u201d said Lee Sung-yoon, a professor of Korean studies at the Fletcher School at Tufts University.\n\nPhoto\n\nThose who promote more engagement with the North say change will be evolutionary, not revolutionary. \u201cNorth Koreans, including North Korean officials, will see they are lagging very behind the world,\u201d Mr. Lankov said. \u201cSome of them will say, \u2018Let\u2019s overthrow the government,\u2019 but many more will say, \u2018Let\u2019s change our policy a bit.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt is not even clear how much the North\u2019s athletes and supporters have seen or heard while at the Games. The dozen female players on the joint ice hockey team sleep in separate dorms and ride a separate bus from their South Korean teammates.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe North Korean cheerleaders and journalists are staying in a remote resort in Inje County, at least a 90-minute drive from many of the Olympic venues.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

During a government briefing in Seoul on Monday, a reporter asked whether Ms. Kim was pregnant, saying she appeared to have a slight baby bump.\n\nIn South Korean media, Ms. Kim was nicknamed \u201cPrincess\u201d or \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s Ivanka,\u201d likening her influence with her brother to that of Ivanka Trump\u2019s on her father, President Trump.\n\nMs. Kim\u2019s trip to South Korea was her debut on the global stage.\n\nBut back at home, she appears careful not to step into the spotlight as part of a government whose monolithic power structure requires all propaganda to be focused on her brother.

He is a strong advocate of dialogue with North Korea but faced doubts that another summit meeting with North Korea would help end its nuclear weapons program.\n\n\u201cAlthough the first step toward a peaceful resolution of Korean Peninsula issues has been laid, discrepancies in the positions regarding the North Korean nuclear issue still remain and there is currently no visible progress in denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\u201d his government said Monday in a statement.", "keywords": ["south", "warm", "north", "trip", "welcome", "jonguns", "moon", "sister", "olympics", "mr", "president", "kim", "korea", "korean", "ms"], "polarity": 0.12578470418470422, "subjectivity": 0.36827176527176536},

After two previous summer games roiled by political boycotts in Moscow and Los Angeles, the countries that had sat out those games all sent athletes to Seoul, making it the host of the largest number of participating nations during the Cold War era.\n\nA year later, the Berlin Wall fell.

Hundreds of musicians and singers from the North have arrived to perform on the sidelines of the Olympic Games.\n\nMs. Kim\u2019s appearance in South Korea will be a rare instance of high-level inter-Korean contact.

The final section of the concert featured several songs on that theme, including \u201cOur Wish Is Unification,\u201d a tune popular in the South.\n\nEven as anti-North activists protested outside, many in the audience sang along as the orchestra performed the nostalgic song under a phalanx of flashing lights.\n\nThe concert symbolized a breakthrough moment after a year of escalating tensions on the peninsula over North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile tests. The last time the North sent an art troupe to South Korea was in 2002, when a group of North Korean singers and dancers performed in Seoul to celebrate Korea\u2019s liberation from Japanese colonial rule in 1945.\n\nAfter its concert on Thursday night, the Samjiyon Orchestra was to head to Seoul, where it will perform on Sunday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe performances are part of a series of measures intended to show unity between the two Koreas in a last-minute deal reached in January in which the North agreed to send a large delegation to the Games, including athletes, high-level officials and performers.

But it has been touch-and-go into the final moments. For example, the North informed the South only this week of its decision to send the art troupe by ferry rather than by land, as expected.\n\nAnd despite the appearance of unity during these Games, mutual suspicion has been palpable. Upon arrival in South Korea on Tuesday, the art troupe declined an invitation to attend a welcome dinner hosted by government officials, opting instead to stay on the ship, according to South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry.\n\nExperts said the North\u2019s decision to lodge the performers on the ship instead of in a hotel had to do with the North\u2019s desire to limit their exposure to South Korean culture and people. The art troupe is believed to be under close watch by others in the North\u2019s delegation, and their schedule and movements in Gangneung and Seoul are being tightly controlled.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Last month, Ms. Hyon ignited a frenzy among local media when she visited South Korea to inspect venues for the performances.\n\nPerhaps because of the buzz surrounding her visit, South Koreans appeared to be more excited about the Samjiyon Orchestra concerts than the actual Olympic events, which so far have had rather lackluster ticket sales. Last week, more than 150,000 people entered a lottery for a chance to win one of more than a thousand free tickets to Samjiyon\u2019s performances in Gangneung and Seoul.\n\nOne of those lucky winners was Keum Sun-hee, 49, who traveled to Gangneung from the eastern province of Gyeonggi with her 18-year-old daughter to see the concert. \u201cI always thought the culture between the North and South had been severed, so it was very moving to see the performance,\u201d said Ms. Keum.\n\nIt is not the first time the North has engaged in so-called music diplomacy.

That would help dispel uncertainty over the event and signal to Mr. Kim that the United States took the Games seriously.\n\nMr. Trump agreed it was important that the Olympics go smoothly, and said Mr. Moon could tell the I.O.C. that Washington would send a high-level delegation, Mr. Moon\u2019s office said at the time.\n\nRelations between the two presidents were difficult. They had staked out different positions on the North Korean crisis, and Mr. Trump had made his disdain of Mr. Moon public, even accusing him of \u201cappeasement,\u201d an extraordinary dig at any American ally.\n\nA glimmer of interest from the North in easing tensions came in December, when the government requested a visit by Jeffrey Feltman, a senior official at the United Nations. The Trump administration approved of the trip, and Mr. Feltman traveled to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, for meetings with diplomats.\n\n\u201cWe suggested to them that they needed to take advantage of the Olympics and use the Olympics as a way to get dialogue going,\u201d he said. The North Koreans were noncommittal, but Mr. Feltman gently suggested that the world would be paying attention to whatever Mr. Kim said next.\n\nIn Washington, the Trump administration began discussing Mr. Moon\u2019s position. The most sensitive question was his proposal to delay the joint military exercises that were scheduled to begin near the end of the Olympics and during the Paralympic Games.\n\nSome officials argued that any delay would be seen as a concession to Mr. Kim and undermine the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d approach to the North. But as the administration deliberated, word of South Korea\u2019s preference for a delay began to appear in news reports. Then, during the youth soccer tournament in Kunming, Mr. Moon publicly confirmed that he had suggested postponing the exercises.\n\nIn the flurry of diplomacy that followed, the United States publicly agreed to the delay and Mr. Kim announced that he would send his athletes, surprising the world.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Washington, some officials were more worried about another aspect of Mr. Kim\u2019s proclamations, specifically a declaration in his New Year\u2019s speech that North Korea would begin \u201cmass production\u201d of nuclear weapons and missiles in 2018.\n\nBut the spotlight had shifted to the Olympics, and the momentum now was behind diplomacy and good will. The North received the promised logistical and financial help, and some of its athletes will be allowed to compete without qualifying.\n\nAnd in a surprise development on Wednesday, the North said that Mr. Kim\u2019s influential sister, Kim Yo-jong, would attend the Games, making her the first immediate member of the North\u2019s ruling family to set foot in the South.\n\nWhite House officials have defended delaying the joint military exercises, saying that South Korea needed to focus on Olympic security for such a vital event. \u201cFor us it\u2019s a practical matter,\u201d Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters.\n\nBut the Olympics hardly resolve the nuclear standoff. Before heading to the Games, Vice President Mike Pence delivered perhaps his harshest remarks about the North Korean regime. \u201cThe American people, the people of Japan and freedom-loving people across the wider world long for the day when peace and prosperity replace Pyongyang\u2019s belligerence and brutality,\u201d he said.\n\nSuch language, analysts said, edged the Trump administration closer to a position of \u201cregime change,\u201d something it has not formally embraced.\n\nStill, Sue Mi Terry, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said the Games were a chance for the North to present itself as a normal country rather than a pariah state. \u201cThere\u2019s no political or financial cost for North Korea,\u201d she said. \u201cSo why not?\u201d\n\nOther analysts said the timing also suited the North\u2019s weapons program, giving its scientists time to study the results of last year\u2019s missile launches and repair its underground nuclear test facility.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Mr. Moon continues to argue that the North\u2019s participation in the Olympics may lead to talks on resolving the nuclear standoff, and he has publicly credited Mr. Trump\u2019s tough policies with contributing to the d\u00e9tente.\n\nMr. Trump has been happy to accept credit, boasting that the Olympics were moving ahead because of him and expressing satisfaction, and even a hint of hope, over the North\u2019s decision to attend.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see them getting involved in the Olympics,\u201d he told reporters in January, \u201cand maybe things go from there.\u201d", "keywords": ["administration", "diplomacy", "save", "nuclear", "standoff", "north", "moon", "mr", "olympics", "trump", "washington", "quiet", "kim", "games"], "polarity": 0.08655974640017194, "subjectivity": 0.4110896196002578},

North Korea is sending 22 athletes to the Olympics, as well as hundreds of cheerleaders, musicians, singers and dancers.\n\nThe two Koreas will march together in Friday night\u2019s opening ceremony in the South Korean town of Pyeongchang, and even field their first-ever joint Olympic team, in women\u2019s ice hockey. Mr. Pence also plans to attend the opening ceremony.\n\nBut hopes for d\u00e9tente have been tempered by deep skepticism over the North\u2019s sudden overtures. United States officials fear that after a year of increasingly provocative missile and nuclear tests, Kim Jong-un may be on a charm offensive to undermine international sanctions that have begun biting his isolated country.\n\nBefore leaving Japan for South Korea, Mr. Pence said the United States would not be duped by any false overture.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to seize every opportunity to ensure that North Korea does not use the powerful imagery and backdrop of the Olympics to paper over an appalling record of human rights and a pattern of developing weapons and conducting the kind of missile launches that are threatening our nation and threatening neighbors across the region,\u201d Mr. Pence said.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Pence met with Mr. Moon later on Thursday, and both reaffirmed a principle of \u201cusing maximum sanctions and pressure to bring North Korea to the negotiating table for denuclearization,\u201d said Mr. Moon\u2019s spokesman, Yoon Young-chan.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBefore meeting Mr. Moon, Mr. Pence said he would seek a South Korean commitment to \u201ccontinue to isolate North Korea economically and diplomatically so that we can achieve what the world has longed to see, which is a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.\u201d\n\nMr. Moon has supported American-led sanctions against the North, but he has repeatedly called for dialogue.

Although North Korea said its delegates had no willingness to meet Mr. Pence, the vice president again did not rule out the possibility of a meeting on the sidelines of the Games.\n\n\u201cThere may be a possibility for any kind of an encounter with North Koreans, whether it be informal or whether it take the form of a meeting,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I said, we\u2019ll have to wait and see exactly how that unfolds.\u201d\n\nIn a jarring contrast to the moves toward reconciliation in the South, columns of goose-stepping soldiers and vehicles carrying rockets, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, rolled through the main square in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, on Thursday as the country celebrated its Army Building Day.\n\n\u201cWe must ensure that no invaders can infringe upon our dignity and independence,\u201d Mr. Kim said in a speech delivered from the podium overlooking the parade. \u201cThe People\u2019s Army must keep in high alert and redouble its preparations for battle as the United States and its followers are making a fuss around the Korean Peninsula.\u201d\n\nIt was the first parade since Mr. Kim declared in his New Year\u2019s Day speech that a \u201cnuclear button\u201d on his desk could launch weapons targeting the mainland United States.

He said the coming Olympics, which are being held in the South Korean resort of Pyeongchang, \u201cwill become a candle that sheds light on peace.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nEven the limited show of cooperation during the Pyeongchang Olympics is the culmination of a long process of sports rapprochement that has tracked the ups and downs of the larger political relationship between the Koreas. No evidence has surfaced of the wealthy South paying off its impoverished neighbor in exchange for Olympic cooperation, but the advances have come at times when the South was more forthcoming with aid and investment.\n\nLast year, the administration of Mr. Moon offered to donate $8 million to two United Nations humanitarian programs working in North Korea. Mr. Moon suspended the plan after international pushback that the offer might undermine United Nations sanctions against the North\u2019s nuclear weapons and missile programs.\n\nIn Pyeongchang, South Korea will pay for the joint uniforms to be worn by athletes of both sides during the opening ceremony, and foot the bill for housing and feeding hundreds of North Korean dancers and cultural entertainers who will perform during the Games. However, no money will go directly to them, South Korean officials have said.\n\nThe North Koreans are also quite likely to be the only athletes not to receive a free smartphone from the Olympic sponsor Samsung. South Korean officials said they were eager to dispel concerns, particularly in Washington, that they were making payments to the North that could violate sanctions.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to brief the Americans so thoroughly about every detail of matters concerning sanctions and the North Korean delegation that they get tired of hearing it,\u201d said Cho Myoung-gyon, who as South Korea\u2019s unification minister is in charge of dealings with the North.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe I.O.C. first urged North and South Korean sports officials to meet in 1963, a time when East and West Germany had created a joint Olympic squad. But the two Koreas could get no further than deciding that a hypothetical joint squad would use a well-known Korean folk song, \u201cArirang,\u201d instead of picking one of their national anthems.\n\nThey agreed to talk again before the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984. But when they met on their shared border, the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone, the talks quickly devolved into mutual recriminations. South Korea demanded that the North apologize for its bombing of Mr. Chun\u2019s presidential delegation in Burma the previous year, which killed 17 South Koreans, while North Korea called Mr. Chun a \u201cbloody-handed\u201d dictator for ordering the massacre of protesters in the city of Kwangju in 1980.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt was nothing but a slandering match,\u201d said Lim Tae-sun, 83, a former South Korean negotiator who was present at the meeting. \u201cWe hardly discussed the real agenda.\u201d\n\nIn 1985, the I.O.C. invited the two Koreas to Lausanne, Switzerland, in an attempt to broker an end to North Korea\u2019s bitter campaign against the 1988 Summer Games awarded to Seoul. The North insisted on sharing the Games, arguing that \u201chosting of the Games by one part of the nation aggravated the antagonism and division between the two peoples.\u201d\n\nIt also made veiled threats, telling a visiting I.O.C. vice president that \u201cany accidental error would have disastrous effects on the peaceful celebration of the Games.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

When North Korea boycotted the 1988 Games, only a handful of its allies, including Cuba, followed suit.\n\nThe first breakthrough came at the end of the Cold War, when the two Koreas agreed in 1991 to form a joint team for the World Table Tennis Championships in Chiba, Japan.\n\nUnder the deal, the two governments agreed that the unified team would use the name Korea and carry a blue-and-white flag showing an undivided Korean Peninsula. The South also made a key concession, agreeing that each Korea should contribute the same number of players.\n\nThe brief sports d\u00e9tente came to an abrupt end that same year when a North Korean attending a judo championship in Barcelona, Spain, defected to South Korea. The North receded into deeper isolation during a devastating famine.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the late 1990s, South Korea persuaded the North to resume sports exchanges with the help of economic aid from a private citizen, Chung Ju-yung, the billionaire founder of South Korea\u2019s Hyundai conglomerate.

The two Koreas marched together in the Olympic opening ceremonies in 2000, 2004 and 2006.\n\nBut even during these years, a joint Olympic team remained out of reach.

Talks to field a joint team at the Summer Games that year in Beijing collapsed after the South rejected the North\u2019s condition of equal numbers of athletes.\n\nThis year\u2019s deal came after Mr. Moon, a political liberal who has expressed eagerness to restore inter-Korean exchanges, took office last May. The North also showed flexibility in agreeing to a joint squad in women\u2019s hockey, one of the few winter team sports in which it competes.\n\nThe joint team was created by adding 12 North Koreans to the existing South Korean national team of 23 players. The head coach is a Canadian appointed by South Korea, who must select at least three North Koreans to play in each game.\n\nSouth Korean officials say they did not promise aid for the deal. But they did make one important concession: postponing joint military exercises with the United States.\n\n\u201cSports exchanges can prosper only when political issues are resolved,\u201d said Chang Ung, a North Korean member of the I.O.C., after landing in Seoul this week. \u201cThat is an unbreakable rule on the divided Korean Peninsula.\u201d", "keywords": ["unity", "south", "north", "team", "war", "mr", "olympics", "split", "olympic", "shows", "games", "joint", "koreas", "korea", "korean", "rare"], "polarity": -0.009674268820610277, "subjectivity": 0.4221029986273889},

But the United States insists it will never enter any serious negotiations or ease sanctions until the North commits itself to nuclear disarmament.\n\nOver the weekend, Mr. Trump announced harsh new sanctions against North Korea and warned of tougher measures if the North fails to relinquish its nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe hard line out of Washington has stood in conspicuous contrast with the more conciliatory gestures from Seoul.\n\nDavid Straub, a former American diplomat who is now a fellow at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, said there were rising frustrations in Washington that Mr. Moon was \u201capparently working at cross purposes with the Trump administration\u2019s effort to apply \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 on North Korea.\u201d\n\nThis \u201ccould result in a serious clash of wills between the two allied leaders,\u201d Mr. Straub said. \u201cIf the Trump administration or the Moon administation does not change its fundamental position, the odds are increasing that relations between the two will worsen.\u201d\n\nMr. Moon, a dogged advocate of dialogue with the North, had spent the last year helplessly watching the Korean Peninsula edge toward active war, as the North test-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles and conducted its most powerful nuclear test, and Mr. Trump threatened to rain down \u201cfire and fury\u201d on North Korea.\n\nDesperate to avoid a possible military conflict, Mr. Moon seized upon the Pyeongchang Games to craft what some analysts called an \u201cOlympic truce.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The first step, according to these officials, is for the administration to settle on a more consistent message toward North Korea.\n\nThe United States has veered in recent weeks from expressing openness to diplomacy to reiterating threats of military action if the North does not curb its nuclear and missile programs. The net effect, according to analysts, has been to confuse both North and South Korea.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhite House officials will also have to decide how to react if the inter-Korean diplomacy accelerates. The Trump administration is determined not to make undue concessions to North Korea, a mistake it says both Democratic and Republican presidents have made. On the other hand, if the United States takes too hard a position, analysts said it could prompt Mr. Moon to conclude that the Americans will never come around.\n\nThat could prompt Mr. Moon to set off on his own, isolating the United States by driving away one of its most important allies in Asia, which could end up drifting closer to China.\n\n\u201cOnce the ball gets rolling, it\u2019s very hard to stop, in large part because Seoul and Beijing want talks so badly,\u201d said Evan S. Medeiros, a managing director at Eurasia Group who was a senior Asia adviser to President Barack Obama.\n\nAnalysts said Mr. Moon was trying to get that forward momentum by seizing on this chance to move the peninsula toward peace with South Korea in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\n\u201cMoon Jae-in is not a na\u00efve waif,\u201d said Gordon Flake, the chief executive of the Perth USAsia Center at the University of Western Australia. \u201cThe South Koreans are desperately seeking to change the trajectory, which was leading to a conflict, and at the same time to do that while not giving too much space between them and the United States.\u201d\n\nFor both the Trump and Moon administrations, the first big test will be what to do about joint United States-South Korean military exercises that were postponed during the Olympics and the Paralympics, which will take place from March 9 to 18.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNorth Korea has indicated that it will restart weapons tests if the drills resume, scuttling Mr. Moon\u2019s efforts to broker a peace.\n\nConservatives in both South Korea and the United States fear that anything less than the full resumption of the war games would only advance the North\u2019s ultimate goal of ridding the peninsula of the American military presence, which they say the South needs for protection.\n\nBut progressive South Koreans who support Mr. Moon would most likely see a push by Washington to resume the exercises as \u201cthrowing cold water over the South\u2019s Olympic party,\u201d and as an effort to derail Mr. Moon\u2019s push for inter-Korean rapprochement, said Lee Byong-chul, senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul.\n\nSouth Koreans who attended Olympic events were cautious about how much the Olympic diplomacy could accomplish.\n\nYeon Ju-lee, 21, who recently watched a joint Korean team in women\u2019s ice hockey, said she felt relieved that the North\u2019s participation in the Olympics was easing fears of possible war. But, she said, actual political unification \u201cwill take a long time.\u201d\n\nAnother spectator, Lee Hae-man, 62, said recent developments were promising \u201cbecause we are all one family together, North and South.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will feel very betrayed if Kim Jong-un goes back to missile tests,\u201d he added.", "keywords": ["south", "north", "nuclear", "peace", "leader", "lasting", "mr", "moon", "trump", "olympics", "olympic", "turn", "koreas", "korea", "states", "truce", "united"], "polarity": 0.007703070931226276, "subjectivity": 0.39912877036663447},

On Friday, Mr. Trump announced harsh new sanctions against North Korea. And hours before the ceremony began on Sunday, a spokesman from the North\u2019s Foreign Ministry described the sanctions as an act of war even as Mr. Moon met with the North Korean delegation Sunday afternoon.\n\nAfter that meeting, and shortly after the Olympic ceremony began, the presidential palace said in a statement that North Korea had indicated it was willing to talk to the United States. But differences are wide, and only the coming weeks and months will show whether the Olympic diplomacy has had a lasting effect.\n\nStill, for a brief moment, the closing festivities celebrated the success of the Pyeongchang Olympics. Organizers said it was the largest Winter Games yet, with 92 countries represented, including first-timers like Ecuador, Kosovo, Nigeria and Singapore.\n\nDespite a cyberattack during the opening ceremony, an outbreak of norovirus and the official suspension of the Russian team for doping violations, the Games went off smoothly.\n\nThere were highlights aplenty. South Korea broke out in a frenzy over curling as its women\u2019s team racked up one surprising win after another, all the way to a silver medal. Chloe Kim, 17, the Korean-American snowboarder, astonished judges and crowds with a near-perfect gold medal run on the halfpipe.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEsther Ledecka of the Czech Republic became the first woman to win a gold medal in two sports in a single Winter Games, while Yuzuru Hanyu, the men\u2019s figure skating champion from Japan, returned after a four-month hiatus because of an ankle injury and captured his second consecutive Olympic gold medal. After a spine tingling shootout, the American women\u2019s hockey team beat Canada to win the gold medal for the first time in two decades.\n\nNorway dominated the medals table, collecting 39 over all, 14 of them gold. The United States won 23 medals, and South Korea 17.\n\nNorth Korea never made it to the medal podium. The only athletes to qualify for the Olympics on merit, Ryom Tae-ok, 19, and Kim Ju-sik, 25, placed 13th in pairs figure skating. All the other athletes in the North\u2019s delegation placed last or near the bottom in their events.\n\nAnd the unified Korean women\u2019s hockey team, the only team to include North and South Korean athletes on its roster, lost all five of the games it played at the Olympics.\n\nBut perhaps the most important achievement of the Pyeongchang Games was that they were peaceful. In his speech at the closing ceremony, Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, thanked the athletes from South Korea and North Korea.\n\n\u201cYou have shown how sports bring people together in our very fragile world,\u201d he said.\n\nBefore North and South agreed that their athletes would march under one flag, tensions on the peninsula had reached a bombastic peak.

So Washington ought to be very thankful that Seoul has taken on this outsized role.\u201d\n\nMs. Trump, who spent most of the last two days attending events and cheering on American Olympians, did not meet officially with the North Korean delegation in either Pyeongchang or Seoul.\n\nDespite some signals from the Trump administration that Washington is willing to engage in some kind of outreach to Pyongyang, analysts said the government had no clear road map for how to move forward.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that they have no plans for what happens if the North Koreans actually do come to talks,\u201d said Jung H.

The North Korean figure skaters seemed to enjoy a variety of global food in the athletes\u2019 cafeteria, said Kam Alex Kang Chan, a South Korean skater who also trained with Mr. Marcotte.\n\nMegan Duhamel, who with her skating partner, Eric Radford, won a bronze medal in pairs figure skating and is married to Mr. Marcotte, said that the North Korean skaters became fans of protein bars made by a friend of hers in Montreal, and that she gave them several to take home.\n\nIn the locker room before a game between the unified Korean women\u2019s ice hockey team and Sweden, some of the South Koreans taught their teammates from the North how to dance to K-pop music, said Sarah Murray, the Korean women\u2019s hockey coach.\n\nThe subtext of some of the curiosity is whether the North Koreans, exposed to glimpses of popular culture or the higher standard of living in the South, might be tempted to defect, as athletes from other Communist countries have done at previous Olympic Games. No North Korean athletes have defected during an Olympics, although one defected in 1991 during a world judo championship in Spain.\n\nSome analysts theorize that exposure to the outside world could eventually drive change back home.\n\n\u201cIt might be better to think that an information inflow will slowly alter the preferences of North Koreans by inevitably poking holes in the ideology,\u201d said Robert E. Kelly, a professor of political science at Pusan National University in South Korea. \u201cOver time, this should change the regime and make it easier to deal. That\u2019s the hope anyway.\u201d\n\nSome American officials espouse a version of this view. \u201cOur sense is the more North Koreans that come here and can see how successful the South has been, the better,\u201d Marc Knapper, the deputy chief of mission at the United States Embassy in Seoul, said during a news conference before the Games.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019ll discover what good things accrue when they decide to rejoin the international community and make the right decisions,\u201d Mr. Knapper added.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet even North Korea watchers who support greater athletic and cultural exchanges say none of it will slow down the country\u2019s nuclear ambitions.\n\n\u201cOf course they will proceed with their nuclear program,\u201d said Andrei Lankov, a North Korea expert at Kookmin University in Seoul. \u201cNothing can be done, short of a military invasion, to reverse it. The best we can hope for is to achieve some kind of freeze.\u201d\n\nAny North Korean who might try to steer the government in a new direction risks severe punishment. Dissidents are thrown into prison camps, and Kim Jong-un has had hundreds of people killed, including his own uncle, and, it is widely believed, his half brother.\n\nCritics say countries hosting North Koreans become susceptible to propaganda designed to soften the North\u2019s image. They point to the regime\u2019s charm offensive at the Olympics, including a visit by Kim Yo-jong, Kim Jong-un\u2019s sister.\n\n\u201cWhile North Korea, the target of engagement, remains a menacing nuclear state, the outsiders have become beholden to the enchanting possibility of their efforts bearing fruit one day,\u201d said Lee Sung-yoon, a professor of Korean studies at the Fletcher School at Tufts University.\n\nPhoto\n\nThose who promote more engagement with the North say change will be evolutionary, not revolutionary. \u201cNorth Koreans, including North Korean officials, will see they are lagging very behind the world,\u201d Mr. Lankov said. \u201cSome of them will say, \u2018Let\u2019s overthrow the government,\u2019 but many more will say, \u2018Let\u2019s change our policy a bit.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt is not even clear how much the North\u2019s athletes and supporters have seen or heard while at the Games. The dozen female players on the joint ice hockey team sleep in separate dorms and ride a separate bus from their South Korean teammates.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe North Korean cheerleaders and journalists are staying in a remote resort in Inje County, at least a 90-minute drive from many of the Olympic venues.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In 2014, it broadcast daily highlights from the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, although none of its athletes competed there. That makes the absence of Olympic broadcasting in the North all the more conspicuous this year.\n\n\u201cThe last thing the North Korean authorities want is for its people to envy the South,\u201d said Jung Gwang-il, a North Korean defector.\n\nLike its former socialist allies, North Korea has recognized the role of sports in reasserting what it calls the country\u2019s ideological superiority. When its athletes returned home with golds, it honored them with car parades and rewards, like new apartments. The most celebrated example was Jong Song-ok, who won the World Championships marathon in Spain in 1999.\n\nMs. Jong famously said she won because while running, she imagined Kim Jong-il, then North Korea\u2019s leader, \u201cbeckoning me from the finish line.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Kim, the father of the current leader, made her a \u201chero of the republic,\u201d the highest honor in the country, for lifting the morale of his people still, in the grip of a devastating famine.

The International Olympic Committee granted the 22 North Koreans at the current games last-minute exemptions to compete in five sports in Pyeongchang, including a dozen who joined the South Korean women\u2019s ice hockey squad to create the first inter-Korean Olympic team ever.

That created an opening for Mr. Kim to engage in what critics called a \u201ccharm offensive.\u201d\n\nMr. Kim sent hundreds of cheerleaders, musicians and singers to the Games to supplement his meager sports contingent. They stole much of the show on the sidelines of the games. He also sent the most unusual Olympic guest: his sister, whose visit to the South, including meetings with President Moon Jae-in, created a media frenzy.

Noting that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan was in attendance, Mr. Ramo described Japan as \u201ca country which occupied Korea from 1910 to 1945, but every Korean will tell you that Japan is a cultural, technological and economic example that has been so important to their own transformation.\u201d\n\nThe remark immediately ignited outrage in South Korea, the Olympic host nation, where resentment of Japan\u2019s harsh early 20th-century annexation of the Korean Peninsula continues to simmer.

After two previous summer games roiled by political boycotts in Moscow and Los Angeles, the countries that had sat out those games all sent athletes to Seoul, making it the host of the largest number of participating nations during the Cold War era.\n\nA year later, the Berlin Wall fell.

Hundreds of musicians and singers from the North have arrived to perform on the sidelines of the Olympic Games.\n\nMs. Kim\u2019s appearance in South Korea will be a rare instance of high-level inter-Korean contact. She is not believed to have ever before met a South Korean official.\n\nIn 2000, her father, Kim Jong-il, held a summit meeting with Kim Dae-jung, then South Korea\u2019s president, but he did not keep his promise to visit the South for a second meeting. In 2007, Roh Moo-hyun, then the South\u2019s president, visited North Korea for the second inter-Korean summit meeting.\n\nKim Jong-il died in 2011 and power was passed to his third son, Kim Jong-un.\n\nMs. Kim and another member of the North Korean delegation, Choe Hwi, were blacklisted by the United States Treasury in January 2017 over allegations of involvement in \u201cserious human rights abuses and censorship activities.\u201d Ms. Kim is believed to be a first vice director of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party\u2019s Propaganda and Agitation Department, which is responsible for censorship of newspapers and broadcast media.\n\nLast June, the United Nations Security Council included Mr. Choe in a list of 14 North Korean officials designated for an asset freeze and travel ban for their involvement in the North\u2019s nuclear weapons program.

But it has been touch-and-go into the final moments. For example, the North informed the South only this week of its decision to send the art troupe by ferry rather than by land, as expected.\n\nAnd despite the appearance of unity during these Games, mutual suspicion has been palpable. Upon arrival in South Korea on Tuesday, the art troupe declined an invitation to attend a welcome dinner hosted by government officials, opting instead to stay on the ship, according to South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry.\n\nExperts said the North\u2019s decision to lodge the performers on the ship instead of in a hotel had to do with the North\u2019s desire to limit their exposure to South Korean culture and people. The art troupe is believed to be under close watch by others in the North\u2019s delegation, and their schedule and movements in Gangneung and Seoul are being tightly controlled.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Last month, Ms. Hyon ignited a frenzy among local media when she visited South Korea to inspect venues for the performances.\n\nPerhaps because of the buzz surrounding her visit, South Koreans appeared to be more excited about the Samjiyon Orchestra concerts than the actual Olympic events, which so far have had rather lackluster ticket sales. Last week, more than 150,000 people entered a lottery for a chance to win one of more than a thousand free tickets to Samjiyon\u2019s performances in Gangneung and Seoul.\n\nOne of those lucky winners was Keum Sun-hee, 49, who traveled to Gangneung from the eastern province of Gyeonggi with her 18-year-old daughter to see the concert. \u201cI always thought the culture between the North and South had been severed, so it was very moving to see the performance,\u201d said Ms. Keum.\n\nIt is not the first time the North has engaged in so-called music diplomacy.

That would help dispel uncertainty over the event and signal to Mr. Kim that the United States took the Games seriously.\n\nMr. Trump agreed it was important that the Olympics go smoothly, and said Mr. Moon could tell the I.O.C. that Washington would send a high-level delegation, Mr. Moon\u2019s office said at the time.\n\nRelations between the two presidents were difficult. They had staked out different positions on the North Korean crisis, and Mr. Trump had made his disdain of Mr. Moon public, even accusing him of \u201cappeasement,\u201d an extraordinary dig at any American ally.\n\nA glimmer of interest from the North in easing tensions came in December, when the government requested a visit by Jeffrey Feltman, a senior official at the United Nations. The Trump administration approved of the trip, and Mr. Feltman traveled to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, for meetings with diplomats.\n\n\u201cWe suggested to them that they needed to take advantage of the Olympics and use the Olympics as a way to get dialogue going,\u201d he said. The North Koreans were noncommittal, but Mr. Feltman gently suggested that the world would be paying attention to whatever Mr. Kim said next.\n\nIn Washington, the Trump administration began discussing Mr. Moon\u2019s position. The most sensitive question was his proposal to delay the joint military exercises that were scheduled to begin near the end of the Olympics and during the Paralympic Games.\n\nSome officials argued that any delay would be seen as a concession to Mr. Kim and undermine the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d approach to the North. But as the administration deliberated, word of South Korea\u2019s preference for a delay began to appear in news reports. Then, during the youth soccer tournament in Kunming, Mr. Moon publicly confirmed that he had suggested postponing the exercises.\n\nIn the flurry of diplomacy that followed, the United States publicly agreed to the delay and Mr. Kim announced that he would send his athletes, surprising the world.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Washington, some officials were more worried about another aspect of Mr. Kim\u2019s proclamations, specifically a declaration in his New Year\u2019s speech that North Korea would begin \u201cmass production\u201d of nuclear weapons and missiles in 2018.\n\nBut the spotlight had shifted to the Olympics, and the momentum now was behind diplomacy and good will. The North received the promised logistical and financial help, and some of its athletes will be allowed to compete without qualifying.\n\nAnd in a surprise development on Wednesday, the North said that Mr. Kim\u2019s influential sister, Kim Yo-jong, would attend the Games, making her the first immediate member of the North\u2019s ruling family to set foot in the South.\n\nWhite House officials have defended delaying the joint military exercises, saying that South Korea needed to focus on Olympic security for such a vital event. \u201cFor us it\u2019s a practical matter,\u201d Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters.\n\nBut the Olympics hardly resolve the nuclear standoff.

Although North Korea said its delegates had no willingness to meet Mr. Pence, the vice president again did not rule out the possibility of a meeting on the sidelines of the Games.\n\n\u201cThere may be a possibility for any kind of an encounter with North Koreans, whether it be informal or whether it take the form of a meeting,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I said, we\u2019ll have to wait and see exactly how that unfolds.\u201d\n\nIn a jarring contrast to the moves toward reconciliation in the South, columns of goose-stepping soldiers and vehicles carrying rockets, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, rolled through the main square in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, on Thursday as the country celebrated its Army Building Day.\n\n\u201cWe must ensure that no invaders can infringe upon our dignity and independence,\u201d Mr. Kim said in a speech delivered from the podium overlooking the parade. \u201cThe People\u2019s Army must keep in high alert and redouble its preparations for battle as the United States and its followers are making a fuss around the Korean Peninsula.\u201d\n\nIt was the first parade since Mr. Kim declared in his New Year\u2019s Day speech that a \u201cnuclear button\u201d on his desk could launch weapons targeting the mainland United States. The missiles on display on Thursday included the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15 ICBMs, which the North test-launched last year.\n\nOther military parades in recent years were broadcast live, but the event on Thursday aired several hours later.\n\nSome analysts in the South said that the North might have decided not to ruffle too many feathers as its athletes and officials were abroad.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nConservative South Koreans have vehemently accused the North of trying to \u201csteal the show\u201d by staging a military parade the day before the Winter Olympics begin.", "keywords": ["south", "contact", "norths", "north", "pence", "nuclear", "jonguns", "meet", "leader", "sister", "highestlevel", "mr", "olympics", "moon", "kim", "korea", "korean"], "polarity": 0.08873327430145615, "subjectivity": 0.39766561721107174},

The two Koreas have also learned to use Olympic diplomacy to achieve in a small, symbolic way a much bigger goal that eludes them in the real world: a show of unity across the divided Korean Peninsula.\n\n\u201cIt is not an impossible dream,\u201d South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, said at the United Nations in September. He said the coming Olympics, which are being held in the South Korean resort of Pyeongchang, \u201cwill become a candle that sheds light on peace.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nEven the limited show of cooperation during the Pyeongchang Olympics is the culmination of a long process of sports rapprochement that has tracked the ups and downs of the larger political relationship between the Koreas. No evidence has surfaced of the wealthy South paying off its impoverished neighbor in exchange for Olympic cooperation, but the advances have come at times when the South was more forthcoming with aid and investment.\n\nLast year, the administration of Mr. Moon offered to donate $8 million to two United Nations humanitarian programs working in North Korea. Mr. Moon suspended the plan after international pushback that the offer might undermine United Nations sanctions against the North\u2019s nuclear weapons and missile programs.\n\nIn Pyeongchang, South Korea will pay for the joint uniforms to be worn by athletes of both sides during the opening ceremony, and foot the bill for housing and feeding hundreds of North Korean dancers and cultural entertainers who will perform during the Games. However, no money will go directly to them, South Korean officials have said.\n\nThe North Koreans are also quite likely to be the only athletes not to receive a free smartphone from the Olympic sponsor Samsung. South Korean officials said they were eager to dispel concerns, particularly in Washington, that they were making payments to the North that could violate sanctions.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to brief the Americans so thoroughly about every detail of matters concerning sanctions and the North Korean delegation that they get tired of hearing it,\u201d said Cho Myoung-gyon, who as South Korea\u2019s unification minister is in charge of dealings with the North.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe I.O.C. first urged North and South Korean sports officials to meet in 1963, a time when East and West Germany had created a joint Olympic squad. But the two Koreas could get no further than deciding that a hypothetical joint squad would use a well-known Korean folk song, \u201cArirang,\u201d instead of picking one of their national anthems.\n\nThey agreed to talk again before the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984. But when they met on their shared border, the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone, the talks quickly devolved into mutual recriminations. South Korea demanded that the North apologize for its bombing of Mr. Chun\u2019s presidential delegation in Burma the previous year, which killed 17 South Koreans, while North Korea called Mr. Chun a \u201cbloody-handed\u201d dictator for ordering the massacre of protesters in the city of Kwangju in 1980.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt was nothing but a slandering match,\u201d said Lim Tae-sun, 83, a former South Korean negotiator who was present at the meeting. \u201cWe hardly discussed the real agenda.\u201d\n\nIn 1985, the I.O.C. invited the two Koreas to Lausanne, Switzerland, in an attempt to broker an end to North Korea\u2019s bitter campaign against the 1988 Summer Games awarded to Seoul. The North insisted on sharing the Games, arguing that \u201chosting of the Games by one part of the nation aggravated the antagonism and division between the two peoples.\u201d\n\nIt also made veiled threats, telling a visiting I.O.C. vice president that \u201cany accidental error would have disastrous effects on the peaceful celebration of the Games.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

When North Korea boycotted the 1988 Games, only a handful of its allies, including Cuba, followed suit.\n\nThe first breakthrough came at the end of the Cold War, when the two Koreas agreed in 1991 to form a joint team for the World Table Tennis Championships in Chiba, Japan.\n\nUnder the deal, the two governments agreed that the unified team would use the name Korea and carry a blue-and-white flag showing an undivided Korean Peninsula. The South also made a key concession, agreeing that each Korea should contribute the same number of players.\n\nThe brief sports d\u00e9tente came to an abrupt end that same year when a North Korean attending a judo championship in Barcelona, Spain, defected to South Korea. The North receded into deeper isolation during a devastating famine.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the late 1990s, South Korea persuaded the North to resume sports exchanges with the help of economic aid from a private citizen, Chung Ju-yung, the billionaire founder of South Korea\u2019s Hyundai conglomerate. In 1999, the two Koreas played friendly basketball matches in Pyongyang and Seoul after ground was broken for an arena Mr. Chung donated in the North Korean capital.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSports exchanges flourished as the two Koreas achieved a political rapprochement during the early 2000s, when liberal administrations in South Korea pursued a Sunshine Policy of promoting warmer ties backed by generous offers of aid and investment. The two Koreas marched together in the Olympic opening ceremonies in 2000, 2004 and 2006.\n\nBut even during these years, a joint Olympic team remained out of reach. South Korean athletes objected to relinquishing their hard-won spots. Coaches said the two Koreas remained just too far apart in thinking, training and abilities.\n\n\u201cI find it hard to imagine archers from the two Koreas competing on the same team,\u201d Seo Keo-won, an executive at the Korea Archery Association in Seoul, said at the time.\n\nThe sports diplomacy froze in 2008 as a new conservative government in Seoul limited ties with the North, refusing to turn a blind eye to its weapons programs. Talks to field a joint team at the Summer Games that year in Beijing collapsed after the South rejected the North\u2019s condition of equal numbers of athletes.\n\nThis year\u2019s deal came after Mr. Moon, a political liberal who has expressed eagerness to restore inter-Korean exchanges, took office last May. The North also showed flexibility in agreeing to a joint squad in women\u2019s hockey, one of the few winter team sports in which it competes.\n\nThe joint team was created by adding 12 North Koreans to the existing South Korean national team of 23 players. The head coach is a Canadian appointed by South Korea, who must select at least three North Koreans to play in each game.\n\nSouth Korean officials say they did not promise aid for the deal. But they did make one important concession: postponing joint military exercises with the United States.\n\n\u201cSports exchanges can prosper only when political issues are resolved,\u201d said Chang Ung, a North Korean member of the I.O.C., after landing in Seoul this week. \u201cThat is an unbreakable rule on the divided Korean Peninsula.\u201d", "keywords": ["unity", "south", "north", "team", "war", "mr", "olympics", "split", "olympic", "shows", "games", "joint", "koreas", "korea", "korean", "rare"], "polarity": -0.009674268820610277, "subjectivity": 0.4221029986273889},

He was last spotted at an Eric Clapton concert in London in 2015, but little else is known of him. Ms. Kim and her brothers studied in Switzerland as teenagers.\n\nKim Jong-un\u2019s older half brother, Kim Jong-nam, was killed in an airport in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in February last year by two women who smeared his face with a rare nerve agent. The assassins, who are on trial, were hired by North Korean agents who analysts said were sent by Kim Jong-un to eliminate a potential threat to his dynastic grip on power.\n\nOutside officials and analysts consider Ms. Kim the pre-eminent female face of the Kim family, which has ruled North Korea since its founding seven decades ago. Her father, Kim Jong-il, also allowed his own sister, Kim Kyong-hui, to hold prominent jobs in the government until his death in 2011.
