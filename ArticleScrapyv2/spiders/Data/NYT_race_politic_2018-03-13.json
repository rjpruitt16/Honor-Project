Among the opposition, the talk centered on families separated or desperate migrants dying trying to reach the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt was a day for the bullhorn and the podium, but not for mass protests, as immigrant rights activists, faith-based groups, union organizers and clergymen used the visit to hone their messages before the midterm elections.\n\nAt the anti-Trump church gathering, Representative Juan C. Vargas, a Democrat whose district includes part of San Diego, delivered a passionate rebuke of the president. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have immigrants, he wouldn\u2019t have wives!\u201d he said. He added, \u201cWe have to resist and we have to let him know that California doesn\u2019t welcome him.\u201d\n\nNeal Jos\u00e9 Wilkinson, a pastor in San Diego, made a plea for civil disobedience. Saying that Jesus was killed because he broke the rules, Mr. Wilkinson declared, \u201cThere\u2019s a higher authority then you Donald Trump!\u201d\n\nThere were softer appeals, as well. \u201cI ask you to keep building bridges of love, of kindness to other people,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Castillo, the pastor of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel, the Catholic church where the rally was held.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s welcome committee of a few hundred people, many dressed in the flag, gathered for what was part pep rally and part celebration of what they viewed as the fulfillment of a campaign promise: the construction of a wall to keep undocumented Mexican immigrants away. To a scratchy rendition of Lee Greenwood\u2019s \u201cGod Bless the U.S.A.,\u201d mixed with clips of Mr. Trump\u2019s acceptance speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention, supporters cast themselves as \u201cdeplorables\u201d and enthusiastic gun owners, and hoped for a glimpse of the president\u2019s motorcade.\n\n\u201cHe said secure the borders, build the wall, everything,\u201d said Julie Horn, explaining her support. Her husband, Scott, a retired construction worker, echoed her views. \u201cI think he\u2019s done great,\u201d he said. As Trump supporters in California, they said they were living in the state only to be close to their grandchildren.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t put a Trump sticker on your car,\u201d Ms. Horn said. \u201cYour car will get smashed.\u201d\n\nNot all of the faces at the rally were white. Kathy Robinson, who is African-American and from Burbank, and who works as a wedding photographer and Uber driver, voted in 2016 for Hillary Clinton. But after the election, she said she regretted that, and had come to view undocumented immigrants as a menace who take jobs away from American citizens. \u201cTrump is not racist,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s just against illegal immigrants. He loves black people.\u201d\n\nLater in the day, Mr. Trump addressed a hangar full of enthusiastic military service members at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar before attending a fund-raiser expected to raise $5 million at the home of Edward Glazer, a chairman of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump has stayed away from California until now, realizing that the state is beyond his reach in 2020 if he runs for re-election, as he says he will.

The border section he visited is currently guarded by a wire fence and sheet metal barrier, which local border patrol agents said have cut down on crossings since they were first put up. Mr. Trump argued that they need to be replaced by something more permanent and impenetrable. He expressed a preference for the models that have slats allowing border patrol officers to see through them.\n\nAs Mexicans watched from across the barrier, Mr. Trump described an epidemic of drugs and human traffickers that he has vowed to stop.

Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, told reporters Tuesday that he was eager to pass it soon, and Mr. Cornyn said he hoped it could pass by next week.\n\nBut neither offered any specifics on a way forward.\n\nAs students plan a nationwide walkout on Wednesday to demand tougher gun laws, the slow progress of Mr. Cornyn\u2019s bill is yet another indication of how ossified the gun debate has become in Washington. The measure, known as the Fix NICS Act \u2014 NICS stands for the National Instant Criminal Background Check System \u2014 is hardly radical and would not do anything to restrict gun ownership. It would simply enforce existing law.\n\nCongress passed a similar measure in 2007 after the shooting at Virginia Tech, hoping to improve the reporting of criminal records and mental health information to the gun purchasing database. It did not head off Sutherland Springs, where a gunman legally bought his firearm despite having been convicted of domestic abuse.\n\nYet at least two, and possibly, three Republican senators are blocking the proposal from quick consideration. And Democrats \u2014 whose leader, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, is a co-sponsor of the measure \u2014 do not want to allow it to move forward for a vote unless it is paired with more far-reaching legislation, like an expansion of background checks and a ban on assault weapons.\n\n\u201cHe comes to the floor every day and says, let\u2019s do the small Fix NICS bill and then we\u2019ll see about other proposals,\u201d Mr. Schumer said Tuesday, referring to Mr. Cornyn. \u201cHe knows, as well as I do, that Fix NICS is not even close to a response to the epidemic of gun violence in the country.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of the Capitol, the House is expected to vote Wednesday on a measure, introduced in response to the Parkland shooting, to beef up safety at the nation\u2019s schools.\n\nThat bill has nothing to do with guns; it would authorize $50 million annually for safety improvements, including training teachers and students in how to prevent violence and developing anonymous reporting systems for threats. A companion measure in the Senate would also give schools money for physical improvements, such as installing metal detectors or bulletproof windows.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely interested in seeing Senator Cornyn\u2019s Fix NICS bill pass, and a significant school safety bill pass,\u201d Mr. McConnell said Tuesday. \u201cThe best way to get that done is still under discussion, but I\u2019m anxious to pass both of them and pass both of them soon.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Tillerson from the Trump administration \u2014 on Tuesday, Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, was tapped to replace him as secretary of state \u2014 removes one the last remaining presidential advisers whose views on global warming are in line with the rest of the world.\n\nMr. Pompeo has questioned the scientific consensus that human activity is changing the climate, and he has strongly opposed the Paris Agreement, a pact among nearly 200 nations to address climate change. He told Congress last year during his Senate confirmation hearing for the C.I.A. post that the notion of climate change as a top national security threat was \u201cignorant, dangerous and absolutely unbelievable.\u201d\n\nMr. Tillerson, despite his decades-long career in the oil industry \u2014 a major contributor to planet-warming pollution \u2014 holds that rising global temperatures spurred by human activity pose significant risks.\n\nThe change in leadership at the State Department all but cements an increasingly hard-line opposition to the idea of climate change at the highest levels of the United States government. Mr. Tillerson\u2019s departure follows the resignation announcement last week of Gary Cohn, the president\u2019s top economic adviser, and the departure last month of George David Banks, a senior adviser to the president on international energy issues. All three had argued to keep the United States in the Paris agreement.\n\nWith the three departures, \u201cthe moderating forces on climate change within the administration are all but gone, the ones that matter,\u201d said Sarah Ladislaw, an energy analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank.\n\nMr. Pompeo, a Tea Party Republican from Kansas, won praise Tuesday from those who deny the human influence on the climate. President Donald Trump announced Mr. Tillerson\u2019s departure in a tweet on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great climate skeptic and he\u2019s not going to be in favor of the Paris treaty as Tillerson was. I think it\u2019s awesome,\u201d said Steven J. Milloy, who runs a website, JunkScience.com, aimed at undermining climate science and who worked on the Environmental Protection Agency transition team for the Trump administration. \u201cThe administration seems to be shedding its Paris climate supporters.\u201d\n\nA State Department official did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman at the C.I.A. declined to comment.\n\nLast year, Mr. Tillerson stood as a lonely voice in the administration\u2019s inner circle urging Mr. Trump not to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, which calls for every country in the world to put forth plans to cut emissions that contribute to warming. Mr. Tillerson\u2019s efforts were unsuccessful, and Mr. Trump announced that the United States would go it alone as the only nation not party to the accord.\n\nThe United States cannot formally withdraw until 2020, and Mr. Trump has since made conflicting statements about whether he might reconsider his decision. In a recent interview, Mr. Banks said he believed the president remained open to rejoining the deal. But others have noted that Mr. Trump appears to be hardening against it, at least in his public remarks.\n\nImage Mr. Tillerson, a former oil executive, boarding a plane in Nairobi, Kenya, to return to Washington on Monday.

Would have been a disaster for our country,\u201d Mr. Trump told the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington last month, calling it a \u201ctotally disastrous, job-killing\u201d agreement.\n\nAs a Kansas member of the House of Representatives, Mr. Pompeo called the Paris Agreement a \u201ccostly burden\u201d to America. He has also questioned the scientific consensus that human activity is causing the planet to warm to dangerous levels.\n\n\u201cThere are scientists who think lots of different things about climate change,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said in a 2013 interview on C-Span. \u201cThere\u2019s some who think we\u2019re warming, there\u2019s some who think we\u2019re cooling, there\u2019s some who think that the last 16 years have shown a pretty stable climate environment.\u201d\n\nAsked again about the science during his C.I.A. confirmation hearing last year, he replied that he stood by his past statements. He also said that, \u201cFrankly, as the director of C.I.A., I would prefer today not to get into the details of the climate debate and science.\u201d\n\nMr. Pompeo\u2019s top funder during his years in Congress was Koch Industries, the petroleum and chemicals conglomerate owned by the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch, who have lobbied for rollbacks in environmental regulation and other libertarian causes.\n\nMr. Pompeo took $375,000 from Koch Industries between 2009 and 2017 and almost $1.2 million from oil and gas companies over all, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, making him one of the top recipients of oil money in the House of Representatives.\n\nIn the 1990s, the Kochs\u2019 venture capital arm also invested in an aeronautics company that Mr. Pompeo started, and later sold, in Wichita, Kan., which is also home to Koch Industries.\n\nIn Congress, Mr. Pompeo backed changes that would benefit the Kochs\u2019 business interests, including eliminating funding for a nationwide registry of greenhouse gas polluters. He also frequently accused the Obama administration of having a \u201cradical climate agenda.\u201d\n\nSince taking the helm of the C.I.A., though, Mr. Pompeo has not spoken publicly about climate change. The agency did help put forward a Worldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community that states that climate change contributes to national security threats.\n\n\u201cI can only hope that in the year of being C.I.A. director, some of that information has found its way up to him,\u201d said Andrew Light, a former State Department climate change negotiator under President Barack Obama. Mr. Light said he did not believe Mr. Pompeo was coming to his new role with an \u201cax to grind\u201d against climate change, but said it was also not likely to be on his agenda.\n\nIf he is confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Pompeo will shape the State Department\u2019s negotiating position at a key United Nations climate change meeting this year in Poland, where nations are expected to discuss their plans for curbing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nHiroko Tabuchi contributed from New York.\n\nLisa Friedman reports on climate and environmental policy in Washington.

The report found \u201cserious derelictions\u201d related to the trip and concluded that the secretary spent much of it sightseeing and improperly accepted a gift of Wimbledon tickets.\n\nThe report in hand, Dr. Shulkin\u2019s critics in the White House and the department \u2014 including his two top communications deputies \u2014 worked behind the scenes to try to hasten his ouster. Dr. Shulkin, who disputed the report\u2019s findings, went public with fears that appointees were \u201ctrying to undermine the department from within.\u201d He iced out those he viewed as a threat and essentially became his own one-person press office.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs recently as last week, after a series of meetings with John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, Dr. Shulkin publicly declared victory, hinting that he had the White House\u2019s support to remove officials battling him.\n\nThe secretary appeared to be regaining his footing. He sat at Mr. Trump\u2019s side during a cabinet meeting, and the two men together called Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia, the chairman of the Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee, to pledge their support for his more moderate health care legislation, according to a congressional aide briefed on the call. The secretary maintains the support of top Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nBut top White House officials have only become more irked with the secretary\u2019s penchant for publicly discussing internal politics, and Mr. Trump has begun searching for a replacement.\n\nMr. Perry is seen as a more pliant figure for the veterans affairs position. Unlike Dr. Shulkin, who had run the department\u2019s health care system under President Barack Obama and spent a career in hospital administration, Mr. Perry has no background in health care delivery, but as Texas\u2019 governor, he showed a willingness to experiment.\n\nIf Mr. Trump were to make the move, possible replacements for Mr. Perry could include Ray Washburne, a Dallas entrepreneur and prominent Republican fund-raiser; J.

One faction has the upper hand and then it does not. Mr. Cohn was the \u201cit boy\u201d of the Trump White House early on until he mildly criticized the president\u2019s response to the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. Then he was on the outs. Then he helped pass Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cut plan and his stock was high again. Then he lost last week\u2019s battle over tariffs and he quit.\n\nNot to worry \u2014 even when Mr. Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs banker, announced his departure, Mr. Trump publicly predicted that he would simply go off to make a few hundred million dollars more and then rejoin the administration in one capacity or another.\n\nMr. Tillerson had yet to turn in his State Department decoder ring before speculation turned to who else would be gone soon. What about John F. Kelly, the forever-on-the-bubble White House chief of staff? Or Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the perpetually on-the-way-out national security adviser?\n\nPhoto\n\nMaybe it depends on whom the president can convince to replace them. He said the other day that he could find 10 people for any job opening, but many first-tier Republicans are staying away from this White House or are banned from its premises because of past opposition to Mr. Trump.\n\nStill, he is not wedded to traditional choices as he scans the horizon for fresh staff members. It helps to be good on television, as Mr. Kudlow is, but not to be too good on television, because it might irritate the boss to be shown up.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmong those Mr. Trump enjoys on Fox News is John R. Bolton, the conservative firebrand who served as ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush. Tongues wagged when Mr. Trump met with Mr. Bolton in the White House recently, prompting speculation that he could replace General McMaster.\n\nBut would Mr. Trump bring in Mr. Bolton, among the nation\u2019s leading hawks on North Korea, at the very moment he plans to sit down with Kim Jong-un, the country\u2019s mercurial dictator, for talks aimed at eliminating its nuclear program peacefully? And then there is Mr. Bolton\u2019s famous mustache. Some around Mr. Trump say it bothers him. Can he get over the facial hair?\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s choice of Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, to replace Mr. Tillerson offers something of a window into his approach. Mr. Pompeo found that the key to favor in the Oval Office was engaging Mr. Trump. The president enjoyed his near daily interactions with Mr. Pompeo at his intelligence briefings.\n\nPhoto\n\nBy contrast, he never really connected with Mr. Tillerson, who was used to being a chief executive rather than a glorified staff member. It probably did not help that Mr. Tillerson was overheard after a meeting last summer calling the president a \u201cmoron,\u201d a comment he never denied, although he had a spokeswoman deny it for him. Mr. Trump has likewise been said not to click personally with General McMaster.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s aides said he acted now because he wanted to get a new team in place before the talks with Mr. Kim. But Mr. Pompeo, a skeptic of talks with North Korea, will become secretary of state, while Mr. Tillerson, an advocate of talks with North Korea, will head for the exits.\n\nIn speaking with reporters on the South Lawn before his trip on Tuesday, the president cited clashing views with Mr. Tillerson over the Iran nuclear agreement and other national security issues.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

During his one year in the White House, Trump has so thoroughly warped the space-time continuum of our news cycle that it seems preposterous that any words about his presidency, slapped between covers, won\u2019t have been overtaken by events by the time they appear in print.\n\nYet there are routes to staying power. One comes from Michael Wolff, whose jaw-dropping (and thinly sourced) tales of White House dysfunction in \u201cFire and Fury\u201d cost Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s onetime Svengali, both his media platform and his billionaire patron. Another successful approach is provided by David Frum, whose elegantly written jeremiad \u201cTrumpocracy\u201d will give future historians ample evidence that not all Republicans fell in line behind their party\u2019s president.\n\nWith \u201cIt\u2019s Even Worse Than You Think,\u201d David Cay Johnston has chosen a third, more difficult path. A former New York Times reporter who in 2001 won a Pulitzer Prize for his expos\u00e9s on tax loopholes, Johnston practices a brand of journalism that\u2019s an amalgam of advocacy and forensic accounting. \u201cIt is not enough just to cover politics and controversies,\u201d he writes. \u201cOften the most important news goes unannounced, lying right out in the open in the government documents most journalists are loath to uncover and read.\u201d It\u2019s Johnston\u2019s contention that much of the media\u2019s coverage of Trump \u2014 fixated as it is on the president\u2019s tweets and feuds \u2014 misses the real damage he\u2019s doing to the country. \u201cThe Trump administration deposited political termites throughout the structure of our government,\u201d Johnston argues. \u201cThe endgame is not just a smaller government, which Republicans always say they want, but a weak government.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJohnston sets out to shine a bright light on these termites. He finds an obvious one in Scott Pruitt, Trump\u2019s man at the Environmental Protection Agency, whose \u201cone-sided approach to E.P.A.\u2019s mandate,\u201d Johnston writes, favors the concerns of the industries it regulates at the expense of the public\u2019s health. Of course, Pruitt has already received considerable media attention. But Johnston uncovers some less well-known termites as well.\n\nPhoto\n\nHis chapter on the goings-on at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is a textbook example of the sort of green-eyeshade reportage on which he built his formidable reputation. First, Johnston explains how Trump\u2019s decision to force out the chairman left the commission with only two members, short of the three required for a quorum, which meant it was unable to approve \u201c$50 billion worth of energy projects\u201d that would have benefited American workers and consumers. Next, Johnston reports that when Trump finally got around to filling out the agency, he didn\u2019t pick anyone with a consumer-protection background, like the chairman he\u2019d just sacked, instead nominating three new commissioners who all favored the utilities. \u201cCongress created FERC \u2026 to protect families, small-business owners and industry from monopolists and pricing schemes that jack up prices while at the same time ensuring an abundant supply of electricity,\u201d Johnston writes.

But the shift disrupts the delicate balance of power in the administration\u2019s national security team.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Tillerson and Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, had run something of a tag team to keep the president in check, finding common ground on policies from the Middle East to East Asia before stepping into the Situation Room. For the better part of a year, that put Mr. Trump in the position of having to overcome their unified advice, which also was sometimes aligned with the White House national security adviser, H. R. McMaster.\n\nOne senior administration official who often sat in the backbenches of those meetings last week described Mr. Trump\u2019s growing frustration at being hemmed in by his two principal national security cabinet members.\n\nThat seems particularly true on Iran, and Mr. Trump singled out that issue on Tuesday as he was preparing to leave for California. He said he and Mr. Tillerson \u201cdisagree on things.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the Iran deal \u2014 I think it\u2019s terrible. I guess he thought it was O.K.,\u201d the president said, referring to Mr. Tillerson. \u201cI wanted to either break it or do something. And he felt a little bit differently.\u201d\n\nHis comments are certain to alarm European allies who have spent the last few days negotiating with Mr. Tillerson\u2019s closest aide, Brian Hook, on a way to add to the agreement that limited Iran\u2019s nuclear program, rather than reopen or scrap the deal. Those moves were intended to keep Mr. Trump from ditching the agreement in mid-May, when he faces a deadline over continued suspension of American nuclear-related sanctions on Iran.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe first Mr. Hook heard of Mr. Tillerson\u2019s ouster was when a reporter for The New York Times called him for comment on Tuesday morning, shortly after the secretary\u2019s 405-day tenure was ended by presidential tweet.\n\nMr. Tillerson\u2019s denouement seemed rife with the symbolism of the change to come. After Mr. Trump was revealed to have used a vulgarity to disparage several African nations, he dispatched Mr. Tillerson on a lengthy trip to the continent last week to make it up to them.\n\nBut while the secretary was away, Mr. Trump agreed to the meeting with Mr. Kim, catching Mr. Tillerson by surprise \u2014 even though he was the one who had long been arguing for opening up a diplomatic channel to North Korea. While in Africa, Mr. Tillerson took a day off to recover from what the State Department said was exhaustion from long nights catching up by phone with Washington.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThen he got food poisoning, cut his travels short, and was fired upon landing in the United States.\n\nIt was clear in recent months that Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Trump were barely talking. The frequent dinners the chief diplomat shared with the president last spring, when the two men were forming their views of how to approach the world, had ended.\n\nMr. Trump had hired Mr. Tillerson because he liked his record of profits and expansion at Exxon, and thought his mane of white hair gave him the look of a secretary of state. But more recently, the president told aides he thought Mr. Tillerson was \u201cweak\u201d \u2014 the ultimate insult in Mr. Trump\u2019s world. His affinity for Mr. Pompeo grew as the men bonded over intelligence warnings and authorizations for covert actions.\n\nMr. Pompeo\u2019s rise will solve one central problem in American diplomacy over the past year: When Mr. Tillerson spoke, few thought he was speaking on behalf of the president.\n\n\u201cIt creates the possibility that someone who is up to speed with the issues, and has a comfortable working relationship with the president, is now in the chair,\u201d said Richard Haass, who served several Republicans and Democrats in senior State Department and National Security Council positions.\n\nAmerica\u2019s interlocutors, Mr. Haass added, will now believe the secretary of state \u201cis speaking with the power and backing of the president.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe question is whether, when President Trump speaks, it sounds like he has consulted his secretary of state,\u201d Mr. Haass, now the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said in a call from India.\n\nThe one arena where Mr. Pompeo\u2019s views are still a mystery is Russia. While serving in Congress, he was a critic of President Vladimir V. Putin. As C.I.A. director, Mr. Pompeo said he believed intelligence assessments that Mr. Putin was behind the effort to influence the 2016 election \u2014 even though Mr. Trump has dismissed those reports for fear it would undercut the legitimacy of his election.\n\nMr. Pompeo has not, however, gone the next step to describe what he thought the United States should do to counter Russia\u2019s actions.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn contrast, Mr. Tillerson had let known his increasing concern about Russia\u2019s activities, and even about Mr. Putin, who famously presented him with an award for his deals with Russia while at Exxon. On Monday, his last day as secretary of state, he agreed with the British government that Russia was most likely behind the nerve gas attack on a Russian living in England \u2014 while the White House has hedged about Russia\u2019s responsibilities. Mr. Pompeo\u2019s views are not known.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest unknown in the ascension of Mr. Pompeo is how it will affect any negotiations with North Korea.\n\nHe has warned many times, since last summer, that Mr. Kim is \u201ca few months\u201d away from acquiring the ability to strike the United States with a nuclear weapon. That is based on a calculation of how long it will take the North to solve the final problems of designing a warhead that can survive re-entry into the atmosphere atop an intercontinental missile.\n\nBut Mr. Pompeo has also been in charge of an active covert campaign against the North, which he has alluded to elliptically on several occasions. The question now is whether that covert effort \u2014 believed to include sabotage of North Korea\u2019s supply chain and renewed cyberattacks on its missile and nuclear programs \u2014 will buy Mr. Trump enough time, and leverage, to make a negotiation work.\n\nNo agency has been more skeptical about the chances of Mr. Kim\u2019s giving up his arsenal than the C.I.A. itself, under Mr. Pompeo.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a presentation last fall at George Washington University, one of the agency\u2019s top Korea analysts said that in the C.I.A.\u2019s view, no amount of sanctions pressure would persuade Mr. Kim that it was worth giving up the weapons that he believes are his only defense from having his country overrun by the United States and its allies.\n\nAssociates of Mr. Pompeo say he shares that view \u2014 which would suggest that while he may soon be running the North Korea negotiations, his expectations of success are limited.\n\nIn retrospect, Tuesday\u2019s shift could explain some comments Mr. Pompeo made over the weekend. In interviews on Fox and CBS, he said he had spent part of the weekend reviewing the C.I.A.\u2019s internal history of American negotiations with North Korea for the past quarter-century. That would have been an odd way for a C.I.A. director to spend his reading time; it makes a lot of sense for a future secretary of state.", "keywords": ["fits", "mr", "thought", "tillerson", "north", "secretary", "reading", "trump", "worldview", "pompeo", "foreign", "state", "policy", "president", "presidents"], "polarity": 0.049069609468545654, "subjectivity": 0.3348360504743484},

That\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\n\nMr. Pompeo, who was elected to Congress in 2010 in the Tea Party wave, has been especially outspoken on Iran. He shares Mr. Trump\u2019s view that the nuclear agreement with Tehran is deeply flawed. Shortly after Mr. Trump was elected, Mr. Pompeo wrote on Twitter, \u201cI look forward to rolling back this disastrous deal with the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terrorism.\u201d\n\nHe has not moderated his messaging at the C.I.A. Five months ago, he called Iran a \u201cdespotic theocracy\u201d and \u201ca pernicious empire that is expanding its power and influence across the Middle East.\u201d\n\nIn October, he slipped up in discussing the volatile issue of Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election, claiming that American intelligence agencies had concluded that the meddling did not affect the outcome. In fact, the agencies did not give an opinion on the effect of the Russian hacking, leaking and propaganda. The agency issued a corrective statement and Mr. Pompeo has not repeated the mistake.\n\nDuring Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, Mr. Pompeo publicly welcomed WikiLeaks\u2019 release of Democratic emails hacked and leaked by Russia. But at the C.I.A., he has denounced the group, which published secret documents on the agency\u2019s hacking last year, as \u201ca nonstate hostile intelligence service.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe has had to juggle some political grenades. When Mr. Trump learned that some American intelligence retirees doubted the evidence that Russia was behind the 2016 hacking, he asked Mr. Pompeo to meet with William E. Binney, a National Security Agency veteran who has championed alternative theories.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The two men had a polite meeting, but Mr. Pompeo did not change his view that Russia was responsible.\n\nRepresentative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, called his former House colleague \u201chard-working and intelligent and willing to hear different points of view.\u201d But he added a cautionary note, saying Mr. Pompeo \u201chas not always been willing to stand up to the president, particularly when Trump has questioned the intelligence community\u2019s conclusions on Russia, and we will need the new secretary to be willing to speak hard truths to the president.\u201d\n\nOn covert action, though the details of most operations remain secret, Mr. Pompeo has taken an aggressive approach. In Afghanistan, the agency has sent small teams of highly experienced officers and contractors alongside Afghan troops to hunt and kill Taliban militants across the country. This marks a shift for the C.I.A. in Afghanistan, where the agency had primarily focused on Al Qaeda and on helping the Afghan spy services.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t perform our mission if we\u2019re not aggressive,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said last fall in a speech in Texas. \u201cThis is unforgiving, relentless. You pick the word. Every minute, we have to be focused on crushing our enemies.\u201d\n\nMr. Pompeo, who served as a tank commander in the Army in Germany and founded an aerospace company, would be one of the most conservative secretaries of state in history. He was an outspoken critic of Hillary Clinton on her handling of the terrorist attack on the American diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya, and co-wrote an addendum to the House Benghazi committee\u2019s report because he felt it did not go far enough. He has said that Edward J. Snowden, who gave an archive of secret National Security Agency documents to journalists, should get the death penalty.\n\nMr. Pompeo brought a taste of America\u2019s domestic culture wars into the agency, laying plans to hire chaplains for the agency, which until now has typically treated religion as a private matter. Officials said that the idea originated during a breakfast Mr. Pompeo had at the C.I.A. with Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, a conservative advocacy group that opposes gay rights, abortion and even divorce \u2014 a common hazard for C.I.A. officers working in operations overseas.\n\nHis hard line against jihadist terrorism has sometimes spilled over into condemnation of Muslims more broadly, as in 2013, when he said American Muslim leaders had not been sufficiently outspoken in denouncing the Boston Marathon bombing, making them \u201cpotentially complicit in these acts.\u201d\n\nSuch statements outraged groups like Muslim Advocates, which urged the Senate on Tuesday not to confirm Mr. Pompeo, whom it said had \u201cmade a career of bigotry and hate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA longtime beneficiary of conservative superdonors Charles G. and David H. Koch, whose oil and chemical company, Koch Industries, is based in Mr. Pompeo\u2019s former district, Mr. Pompeo repeatedly attacked the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to battle climate change. He opposed the Paris climate agreement and has been publicly skeptical that human activities are largely responsible for the atmosphere\u2019s warming, though he has not tried to block the intelligence agencies\u2019 finding that climate change contributes to security threats.\n\nSenator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas and a close friend of Mr. Pompeo\u2019s who traveled abroad with him both when he was in Congress and while he has been at the C.I.A., said that despite his sometimes harsh language and strong views, Mr. Pompeo is a good choice for the State Department.\n\n\u201cMike consistently in our foreign travels has been diplomatic but firm,\u201d Mr. Cotton said. \u201cHe won\u2019t dodge hard issues, but he won\u2019t needlessly antagonize people.\u201d", "keywords": ["agency", "pleased", "russia", "mr", "hawk", "american", "view", "trump", "intelligence", "cia", "agencies", "spying", "pompeo", "diplomacy", "mike", "president", "moves"], "polarity": 0.036899608328179755, "subjectivity": 0.4582051381158524},

During presidential trips, Mr. McEntee and the White House doctor were two aides who were never left off the travel manifest. Aides said that Mr. McEntee often tried to keep hangers-on away from Mr. Trump when he traveled to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\n\nNow, with Mr. McEntee gone, the president will have none of his closest, most trusted aides by his side at all times. Kellyanne Conway, who remains close to Mr. Trump, does not frequently travel with the president. Ivanka Trump, his daughter, and her husband, Jared Kushner, have offices near Mr. Trump but play different roles.\n\nMr. McEntee\u2019s departure has several of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest advisers worried about the effects on the president\u2019s mood. The senior administration official said that the president had been in a \u201cgood place\u201d recently, but said that it was hard to overstate the effect of the departure, along with that of Ms. Hicks. Both Mr. McEntee and Ms. Hicks have had offices just outside the Oval Office.\n\nA former quarterback with the University of Connecticut, Mr. McEntee had his first brush with fame when he released a football trick-shot video on YouTube that went viral in 2011. The nearly five-minute video has almost 7.3 million views.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. McEntee worked at Fox News in 2015 when he volunteered on Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and quickly became a full-time staff member. Over the course of the chaotic campaign, Mr. McEntee became close with Mr. Trump and joined the small cadre of loyal, trusted aides around him.\n\nLike Reggie Love, a former Duke basketball player who served as the personal assistant and first body man to President Barack Obama, Mr. McEntee was one of the few people with nearly constant access to the president he served.\n\nBut unlike many of Mr. Trump\u2019s more famous advisers, Mr. McEntee was absent from public view, making virtually no comments to the news media and remaining largely under the radar amid the backbiting and chaos swirling around the president.\n\nMr. McEntee\u2019s ouster is the latest fallout from the security clearance scandal that erupted when Rob Porter, the president\u2019s staff secretary, resigned under pressure last month. Mr. Porter left after it was revealed that allegations of spousal abuse were holding up his permanent security clearance.\n\nA review of the security clearances at the White House by Mr. Kelly found that many officials were operating with interim clearances. In a memo to the staff last month, Mr. Kelly said that he would revoke the interim clearances for people whose background investigations showed they could not receive permanent clearance.\n\nLate last month, Mr. Kushner\u2019s security clearance was downgraded, but Mr. Kushner remains a senior adviser at the White House working on Middle East peace efforts, prison reform and other issues for Mr. Trump.", "keywords": ["aide", "aides", "campaign", "mr", "mcentee", "issue", "staff", "white", "forced", "trump", "house", "trumps", "joins", "reelection", "president", "security", "john"], "polarity": 0.1037498308982684, "subjectivity": 0.30678267045454544},

In the weeks leading up to Mr. Trump\u2019s first calls to ban bump stocks, the official said, the White House knew the bureau was open to revisiting a ban.\n\nYet in tweets, public remarks and statements, Mr. Trump upended the time-consuming, often-overlooked federal rule-making process, which requires coordination among multiple agencies. The president dismissed it as \u201clong and complicated,\u201d vowing that bump stocks would be banned and that the legal review was almost finished.\n\n\u201cI expect that these critical regulations will be finalized, Jeff, very soon,\u201d Trump said in the days after the Florida shooting, directly addressing Mr. Sessions while the agency was continuing its review.\n\nAs recently as last week, the public positions of the president and the bureau were out of sync. Mr. Trump announced that the \u201clegal papers\u201d to ban bump stocks were nearly completed and said the devices would soon be \u201cgone.\u201d That same day, bureau officials said that the agency was still reviewing the issue, and that no final determination had been made.\n\nTraditionally, the bureau would study existing statutes, decide that the law permits it to regulate bump stocks and then submit a proposed rule to the Justice Department. The deputy attorney general\u2019s office would make modifications before the budget office reviewed and approved the rule change, and it would then be published in the Federal Register.\n\nThe regulation of bump stocks has strayed from that pattern. The bureau determined in 2010 that it could not regulate the devices because they could not be defined as machine guns, which are regulated under the National Firearms Act, the law that regulates firearms in the United States. To prohibit bump stocks, the agency had to contradict that earlier position, essentially saying the statute had not changed but could be read differently to include such a ban.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Justice Department and A.T.F. officials privately stuck by their earlier conclusion that they could not outlaw bump stocks, but with little appetite to tackle gun policy in Congress, Mr. Sessions asked the A.T.F. to review its determination.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAgencies periodically scrutinize earlier rulings and change interpretations. What set apart the bump stock evaluation, according to former bureau officials, was Mr. Trump\u2019s overt political pressure.\n\n\u201cNo disrespect intended, but I\u2019m sure President Trump has no idea what exactly the authority is for A.T.F. or the D.O.J. to ban these things,\u201d said Bradley A. Buckles, who was the head of the bureau from 1999 to 2004. \u201cIn all honesty, he doesn\u2019t know what his authority is in that regard.\u201d\n\nAnd in altering its 2010 interpretation made under former President Barack Obama, the bureau could be subject to lawsuits that tie up a bump stock ban in the courts.\n\n\u201cThe Justice Department and the A.T.F. are going to get sued, and Trump is going to get flak,\u201d said Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law in Houston. \u201cObama was correct in his interpretation of the statute. If you want to ban bump stocks, it has to be done through Congress.\u201d\n\nThe apparent reversal on bump stocks appears to be more political than legal, said Rick Vasquez, a former A.T.F. official who supervised the bureau\u2019s prior determination on bump stocks.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re basically playing games with the regulations and the law right now just to make a political statement,\u201d he said.\n\nOther presidents have also influenced Justice Department rule making to help their preferred policies come into fruition, then watched as those rules became fodder for lawsuits. Under Mr. Obama, the Justice Department created the legal underpinnings to protect undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children after Congress failed to address the issue. That program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, was the subject of multiple lawsuits.\n\nIf bump stock bans are approved, as expected, questions remain on how the rule will be enforced, including whether it will apply to purchases before a ban would be instituted.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Trump continued to publicly press for a ban. \u201cBump Stocks,\u201d he tweeted, \u201cwill soon be out.\u201d", "keywords": ["department", "mr", "revisits", "justice", "pressured", "ban", "atf", "law", "rules", "bump", "trump", "stock", "stocks", "bureau"], "polarity": 0.04037232928361961, "subjectivity": 0.30169552669552674},

In New York City, middle and high school students may walk out of class with approval from a parent, such as with a permission slip, but elementary school students cannot leave unless a parent or guardian comes to check them out.\n\nAt Woods Cross Elementary School in Woods Cross, Utah, students will be allowed to leave class at 10 a.m. and go to the gym for 17 minutes, the same starting time and duration (one minute for every victim in Parkland, Fla.) as other walkouts around the country. Parents may also check them out of the school during that time, and they will not be penalized.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re giving them an opportunity to express their First Amendment rights in a safe place,\u201d said Rachel Peterson, a physical education teacher at the school who is also safety commissioner for the state board of the Utah PTA.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn suburban Nashville, David L. Snowden, director of schools for the Franklin Special School District, sent an email to families saying that the district had decided that it would not be appropriate for students in its elementary schools, which run through fourth grade, to participate in the walkout, but that students in grades five and up could join.\n\nIn an interview, Dr. Snowden said he was not concerned that very young children would be frightened by the walkout, only that they would not understand what it was about. \u201cSometimes I think when you\u2019re teaching children, especially younger children, you try to take into consideration, will there be a full understanding of what they\u2019re doing and why they\u2019re doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cJust to walk out of class for 17 minutes, I\u2019m not sure what that is really teaching.\u201d\n\nEven within Akron\u2019s 50-school district, agendas for Wednesday differed markedly from school to school. At Firestone Park Elementary, students were expected to read a poem about peace. At Pfeiffer Elementary, students would be reviewing safety procedures. And at Robinson Community Learning Center there were no plans at all \u2014 students had not expressed an interest, according to the district.\n\nElise Cappella, a clinical psychologist and associate professor at New York University\u2019s Steinhardt School, said there was a difference between what the youngest students \u2014 from kindergarten to second grade \u2014 and older children could understand. While not advocating any particular stance, she said: \u201cSchools could make the decision that kids in kindergarten through second grade are not provided the opportunity to walk out. They are cognitively, socially, emotionally younger. They may feel more fear about it and less understanding.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nChildren in the third grade and up, she said, will be more likely to be exposed to news and hear their parents talking about it. \u201cThey are reaching a point where having something that\u2019s potentially positive and productive to do that makes them feel a sense of agency and safety could be a good thing,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Cappella said that whether elementary schools decided to participate in the protest or not, the goal should be to project a sense of community to their students.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Canavan, the schools superintendent in Harford County, Md., said that a walkout \u201cpresents, paradoxically, a threat to student safety, as word of the walkout has been widely disseminated and students who go outside could become more vulnerable.\u201d\n\nInstead, Ms. Canavan said, her district would offer \u201ca learning module that will provide students with an opportunity to share their feelings about recent events across the nation and will allow them to speak about solutions in a structured way.\u201d\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, which has offered training to students planning to participate in the walkouts, said that districts can discipline students under attendance guidelines.\n\n\u201cBut what they can\u2019t do,\u201d the A.C.L.U. wrote in a guide for student protesters, \u201cis discipline you more harshly because of the political nature of or the message behind your action.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven some schools where demonstrations are being allowed are being careful about the tone.\n\nMs. Peterson, of Woods Cross in Utah, said that there was no program planned for the assembly \u2014 the students would be able to express themselves as long as they were not rowdy or disruptive. \u201cWe are teachers and not necessarily there to make a political statement in that time,\u201d she said. \u201cWhatever is decided by students in that time and space, we will allow it to happen as long as it is peaceable and respectful.\u201d\n\nIf some students who stayed behind expressed surprise or bafflement at their classmates leaving the room, she said, teachers would use their own tact and judgment about how to explain it. \u201cThe way I would word it is that some kids are walking out to show support for lessening school violence, in honor of the people in Florida,\u201d Ms. Peterson said.\n\nBut in Alexandria, Va., when one school decided that fifth graders could join the walkout if their parents signed them out, a parent lodged her own form of protest.\n\n\u201cMy elementary school has 5-year-olds in it,\u201d the parent, Julie Gunlock, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning Independent Women\u2019s Forum, said in an interview. \u201cSome of my friends, their kids are much younger than a fifth grader.

Conservatives were using the Trump administration\u2019s effort to rein in federal overreach to reverse policies designed to protect against what the Obama administration had seen as discriminatory practices.\n\nThe \u201cRethink Discipline,\u201d package that Mr. Trump\u2019s commission will examine includes guidance that the Obama administration issued on the legal limitations on the use of restraints and seclusion, corporal punishment and equity for special education students.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Teachers who sought suspensions or expulsions of minority students were painted as racists, conservatives maintained.\n\n\u201cEvidence is mounting that efforts to fight the school-to-prison pipeline is creating a school climate catastrophe and has if anything put at-risk students at greater risk,\u201d said Max Eden, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, who argued that teacher bias was not the driving force behind school discipline.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut proponents argued that racial bias was well documented.\n\nWhen the guidance was issued, federal data found that African-American students without disabilities were more than three times as likely as their white peers without disabilities to be expelled or suspended, and that more than 50 percent of students who were involved in school-related arrests or who were referred to law enforcement were Hispanic or African-American.\n\n\u201cChildren\u2019s safety also includes protection from oppression and bigotry and injustice,\u201d Daniel J. Losen, director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies at the University of California at Los Angeles\u2019s Civil Rights Project, wrote in testimony to the Civil Rights Commission. \u201cFear-mongering and rhetoric that criminalizes youth of color, children from poor families and children with disabilities should not be tolerated.\u201d\n\nThe Education and Justice Departments wrote in a 2014 Dear Colleague letter that discipline disparities could be caused by a range of factors, but the statistics in the federal data \u201care not explained by more frequent or more serious misbehavior by students of color.\u201d The departments also noted that several civil rights investigations had verified that minority students were disciplined more harshly than their white peers for the same infractions.\n\n\u201cIn short, racial discrimination in school discipline is a real problem,\u201d the guidance said.\n\nIn recent months, Ms. DeVos has said change will be coming. She has already moved to rescind a regulation that protects against racial disparities in special education placements. Her goal, she said last month, was to be \u201csensitive to all of the parties involved.\u201d\n\nIn a bruising interview on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on Sunday, Ms. DeVos said that the disproportionate discipline issue \u201ccomes down to individual kids.\u201d She declined to say whether she believed that black students disciplined more harshly for the same infraction were the victims of institutional racism.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re studying it carefully and are committed to making sure students have opportunity to learn in safe and nurturing environments,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. DeVos\u2019s office for civil rights also announced that it would scale back the scope of investigations, reversing an approach taken under the Obama administration to conduct exhaustive reviews of school districts\u2019 practices and data when a discrimination complaint was filed.\n\nBut Ms. DeVos\u2019s own administration has continued to find racial disparities. In November, the Education Department found that the Loleta Union Elementary School District in California doled out harsher treatment to Native American students than their white peers. For example, a Native American student received a one-day out-of-school suspension for slapping another student on the way to the bus, in what was that student\u2019s first disciplinary referral of the year. A white student received lunch detention for slapping two students on the same day \u2014 the student\u2019s fifth and sixth referrals that year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile Mr. Cruz was repeatedly kicked out of class and ultimately expelled, it is unclear whether he was ever referred to the police for his behavior in school. However, Mr. Cruz was known to law enforcement, which never found cause to arrest him, and a report of troublesome behavior to the F.B.I. went unheeded.\n\nThe Broward County superintendent, Robert Runcie, said that Mr. Rubio\u2019s effort to connect the district\u2019s discipline policies to the Stoneman Douglas shooting was misguided.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to dismantle a program that\u2019s been successful in the district because of false information that someone has put out there,\u201d Mr. Runcie said on Twitter. \u201cWe will neither manage nor lead by rumors.\u201d", "keywords": ["policies", "discipline", "finds", "culprit", "mr", "program", "unlikely", "students", "rubio", "shootings", "trump", "school", "education", "rights", "guidance", "obama", "law"], "polarity": 0.05909788089563371, "subjectivity": 0.4107174473466609},

And yes, it could be wrong. Or \u201cwrong.\u201d To understand why, it\u2019s important to understand how our forecast works.\n\nImage\n\nUpdate: The polls have closed in Pennsylvania. Check out our live results page.\n\nThere was only one prediction that we were prepared to make around 9:45 p.m. on the night of the Alabama special election in December: If Roy Moore won, it would have been the end of our live forecast dial \u2014 affectionately or grudgingly known as the needle.\n\nThe Upshot writes about data and policy, and the needle is our way of following live election results and adjusting for the votes that have yet to be counted.\n\nAt that point, a victory for Mr. Moore would have been no surprise for those watching returns on television or online. He held a lead of 8.3 percentage points with two-thirds of precincts counted. But the needle was unconvinced. Doug Jones, the Democratic candidate, had a 62 percent chance to win, according to our estimates.\n\nFor many careful consumers of news and journalism, a loss for Mr. Jones would have been an incontrovertible failure for our forecast. And it would have come on the heels of the needle\u2019s performance in the 2016 election, which was widely, though wrongly, perceived as a failure. The reaction would have been scathing.\n\nIn the end, Mr. Jones prevailed. \u201cAll hail the needle\u201d resounded on liberal Twitter. But the needle could have very easily been \u201cwrong,\u201d if \u201cwrong\u201d meant the leading candidate went on to lose.\n\nThe reaction after Alabama weighed on our thinking as we considered whether to publish a forecast for the special election on Tuesday in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th Congressional District.\n\nIt was sobering to see the triumphant coverage of the needle after Alabama, especially compared with how people reacted after the presidential race. Yes, it forecast a win for Mr. Jones before many others did. But if anything, it was as close to \u201cwrong\u201d as it had ever been in a high-profile setting: For five minutes, it showed Mr. Jones favored to win by eight points. (He went on to win by about 1.5 points.)\n\nBy our standards, the live forecast actually performed much better on election night in 2016, when it showed Donald J. Trump had a greater than 95 percent chance of winning hours before the race was called.\n\nYes, that night started with Hillary Clinton as a favorite, based on pre-election polls that had given Mrs. Clinton a clear but modest lead. But the needle makes election night forecasts, not pre-election forecasts. It had to start somewhere, and it merely inherited Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presumed edge.\n\nThe needle did its job: It swung swiftly when votes from Midwestern battleground states began to be counted. It gave Mr. Trump the edge in Pennsylvania, even when Mrs. Clinton had a double-digit lead in the state. It performed exactly as we had hoped and, frankly, if more readers and journalists were conservatives, they would have seen it just as they saw it in Alabama: as the leading indicator of a thrilling upset.\n\nWith that history, do we really want to risk being \u201cwrong\u201d in a lower-profile special election?\n\nRight or wrong, we\u2019re doing it anyway.\n\nWhy the Needle\n\nIncomplete election results are often deeply unrepresentative. That was certainly the case in Alabama. The state\u2019s predominantly white, rural and Republican counties were among the first to report, giving Mr. Moore a big but unsustainable lead.\n\nMany sophisticated analysts would have recognized that Mr. Jones was poised to close the gap. Television viewers might have gotten a sense of Mr. Jones\u2019s route to victory from on-air analysts like MSNBC\u2019s Steve Kornacki or CNN\u2019s John King, who pointed to the remaining Democratic vote in Montgomery and Birmingham. Network decision desks certainly knew: They have their own internal forecasts, which will probably compete with the needle one day, perhaps even as soon as this year\u2019s midterm elections. Maybe they\u2019ll put the needle out of business.\n\nOnline viewers looking at a traditional election results page, on the other hand, would have had no idea, unless they knew Alabama\u2019s political geography well enough to figure it out for themselves.\n\nOur live forecast is just a formal means to do for online viewers what analysts like Mr. Kornacki or Mr. King have been doing for television viewers for years. It looks at where votes remain to be counted, and makes an educated guess about how those votes will break based on past election results and trends evident in initial returns.\n\nThere is an argument that all of this is a waste of time: After all, we\u2019ll know the actual result soon enough. We are sympathetic to that idea, but if people are going to follow election night results online \u2014 and they do, by the millions \u2014 they ought to have the context to understand them. In 2016, that meant letting readers know Mr. Trump was an overwhelming favorite as soon as we knew.\n\nThis time, the special election in Pennsylvania has near-optimal conditions for a needle. Election officials say that precinct-level results will be available. There is also no meaningful early vote, which can often be deeply unrepresentative. This is just about the best possible environment to make quick and relatively confident inferences about the favorite.\n\nWe do have one big concern: A county might be slow to publish precinct results, or might entirely fail to do so. If the precinct data falls too far behind the county-level results from The Associated Press, we might even have to turn the needle off. But that\u2019s out of our hands.\n\nWhy the Needle Is Risky\n\nDespite these advantages, the needle could easily be \u201cwrong\u201d tonight, at least if the measure of right or wrong is whether the leading candidate goes on to win.\n\nThe challenge boils down to two unavoidable problems: Our initial expectations for how a place might vote are never perfect, and initial results are never perfectly representative.\n\nTo understand, it\u2019s worth taking a moment to consider how the needle works. Simply put, it estimates the final result by looking at what votes are left to be counted.\n\nIt starts with a weakly held assumption about the turnout and vote choice of every precinct or county. We call that set of assumptions a baseline. As votes are tabulated, the needle compares the returns with the prior baseline. If the reported vote share or turnout differs from our initial expectations, the needle will assume that similar outstanding areas will differ from our expectations in a similar manner.\n\nAs the night progresses, the needle will have more and more data to work with. But early on, issues with the baseline are a big factor.\n\nImagine, for instance, that our baseline tonight underestimates the final performance of the Democrat, Conor Lamb, in white working-class areas but overestimates him in well-educated suburbs. If the first results are from white working-class areas, the needle will tick to the left as Mr. Lamb beats expectations. The Republican, Rick Saccone, would eventually counter in the suburbs, but at the beginning of the night there would be no way to know.\n\nThe bigger danger to the needle is representativeness: the possibility that the reported results are particularly good for one candidate, even after considering the political and demographic characteristics of the reported areas.\n\nOne obvious example is the early vote, which often reports first and leans Democratic. This problem is pretty easy to fix if the state reports the absentee or early vote separately. We used this separate data in recent elections in Virginia and Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District. Otherwise, it\u2019s very hard to correct. Fortunately, this is not a factor in Pennsylvania.\n\nA less obvious example is the sequencing of the results: A candidate\u2019s best or worst areas could report first. After all, there\u2019s always going to be somewhere with surprising results. If the worst or best news for a party comes first, the needle could mislead \u2014 even for a long time.\n\nTo some extent, this happened in Alabama. The Republicans had a big turnout problem, but for a few minutes our forecast believed it was catastrophic, since the first counties to complete their count included some of the weakest Republican turnouts of the night. Mr. Jones briefly soared in our estimate. The magnitude of our error at that point \u2014 nearly seven points \u2014 was huge, even if brief.\n\nWhy the Needle Will Be \u2018Wrong\u2019\n\nBut as perilous as Mr. Jones\u2019s fleeting eight-point lead was for The Upshot , or as frustrating as Mrs. Clinton\u2019s initial edge may have been for her supporters, the needle hasn\u2019t yet faced its real worst-case scenarios.\n\nThe needle\u2019s worst nightmare will come at the end of a night, not the beginning.\n\nWith so much data already in by that time, unrepresentative data at the end of a night can be a big surprise. It could mean that one candidate loses a projected lead in the final returns, perhaps even after leading the whole night.\n\nImagine, for instance, that Fayette County (where Republicans had their worst turnout in Alabama, at just 63 percent of our expectations) was the last county to finish its count, rather than the fourth earliest. And imagine that it wasn\u2019t a small county, but a large metropolitan one, with 200,000 voters initially expected. In this hypothetical, the final turnout would be just 126,000 votes, nearly 80,000 short of initial expectations and probably still 50,000 short of what we would have expected by the end of the night. Mr. Moore won Fayette County by a 50-point margin, so the turnout error would have been worth a net of 25,000 votes. That\u2019s a two-point swing in the projected statewide popular vote that we would learn about only in the final moments of the race.\n\nIf the needle lives long enough, one night the needle will suggest Democrats are poised to win, even as Republicans hold a lead in the tabulated vote. In the end, the Republican candidate will survive as a major urban center doesn\u2019t yield as many votes as the needle imagined. Or alternately, the Republican will be favored all night, only to be overtaken because of an unexpectedly large Democratic turnout.\n\nKeep these possibilities in mind if one candidate tonight has a 90 percent chance of victory at some point. You won\u2019t have any way of knowing whether the 10 percent chance of an upset is about to become a reality; know only that such a thing could really happen. If an upset wasn\u2019t a possibility, the model would assess a 100 percent chance of victory. And if the needle was always \u201cright,\u201d then our probabilities would be quite wrong.\n\nUltimately, it is impossible to prevent the needle from being \u201cwrong.\u201d It is an inevitability, if the needle is put to work in enough elections. The challenge is to communicate the possibility of an upset, for as long as the possibility remains. Traditionally, we have used probabilities to do so, but we increasingly doubt whether this helps readers understand the uncertainty.\n\nThis was evident before the result of the 2016 election, and as a result we tried something new: a jitter, where the needle quivered to reflect the uncertainty around the forecast. Although many readers disliked it, the jitter reflected an earnest attempt to give tangible meaning to abstract probabilities. Nonetheless, we turned the jitter off for all of our 2017 forecasts.\n\nTonight, readers will have the option to turn the jitter off. We expect that some readers will opt to do so, but remember this: Switching it off only hides the uncertainty \u2014 it doesn\u2019t make it go away.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s not over until the race is called.\n\nNate Cohn is a domestic correspondent for The Upshot.

The measure, known as the Fix NICS Act \u2014 NICS stands for the National Instant Criminal Background Check System \u2014 is hardly radical and would not do anything to restrict gun ownership. It would simply enforce existing law.\n\nCongress passed a similar measure in 2007 after the shooting at Virginia Tech, hoping to improve the reporting of criminal records and mental health information to the gun purchasing database.

And Democrats \u2014 whose leader, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, is a co-sponsor of the measure \u2014 do not want to allow it to move forward for a vote unless it is paired with more far-reaching legislation, like an expansion of background checks and a ban on assault weapons.\n\n\u201cHe comes to the floor every day and says, let\u2019s do the small Fix NICS bill and then we\u2019ll see about other proposals,\u201d Mr. Schumer said Tuesday, referring to Mr. Cornyn. \u201cHe knows, as well as I do, that Fix NICS is not even close to a response to the epidemic of gun violence in the country.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of the Capitol, the House is expected to vote Wednesday on a measure, introduced in response to the Parkland shooting, to beef up safety at the nation\u2019s schools.\n\nThat bill has nothing to do with guns; it would authorize $50 million annually for safety improvements, including training teachers and students in how to prevent violence and developing anonymous reporting systems for threats. A companion measure in the Senate would also give schools money for physical improvements, such as installing metal detectors or bulletproof windows.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely interested in seeing Senator Cornyn\u2019s Fix NICS bill pass, and a significant school safety bill pass,\u201d Mr. McConnell said Tuesday. \u201cThe best way to get that done is still under discussion, but I\u2019m anxious to pass both of them and pass both of them soon.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Tillerson as Secretary of State, received considerable funding from oil and gas companies while in Congress. Credit Lawrence Jackson for The New York Times\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The fall of Rex W. Tillerson from the Trump administration \u2014 on Tuesday, Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, was tapped to replace him as secretary of state \u2014 removes one the last remaining presidential advisers whose views on global warming are in line with the rest of the world.\n\nMr. Pompeo has questioned the scientific consensus that human activity is changing the climate, and he has strongly opposed the Paris Agreement, a pact among nearly 200 nations to address climate change. He told Congress last year during his Senate confirmation hearing for the C.I.A. post that the notion of climate change as a top national security threat was \u201cignorant, dangerous and absolutely unbelievable.\u201d\n\nMr. Tillerson, despite his decades-long career in the oil industry \u2014 a major contributor to planet-warming pollution \u2014 holds that rising global temperatures spurred by human activity pose significant risks.\n\nThe change in leadership at the State Department all but cements an increasingly hard-line opposition to the idea of climate change at the highest levels of the United States government. Mr. Tillerson\u2019s departure follows the resignation announcement last week of Gary Cohn, the president\u2019s top economic adviser, and the departure last month of George David Banks, a senior adviser to the president on international energy issues. All three had argued to keep the United States in the Paris agreement.\n\nWith the three departures, \u201cthe moderating forces on climate change within the administration are all but gone, the ones that matter,\u201d said Sarah Ladislaw, an energy analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank.\n\nMr. Pompeo, a Tea Party Republican from Kansas, won praise Tuesday from those who deny the human influence on the climate. President Donald Trump announced Mr. Tillerson\u2019s departure in a tweet on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great climate skeptic and he\u2019s not going to be in favor of the Paris treaty as Tillerson was. I think it\u2019s awesome,\u201d said Steven J. Milloy, who runs a website, JunkScience.com, aimed at undermining climate science and who worked on the Environmental Protection Agency transition team for the Trump administration. \u201cThe administration seems to be shedding its Paris climate supporters.\u201d\n\nA State Department official did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman at the C.I.A. declined to comment.\n\nLast year, Mr. Tillerson stood as a lonely voice in the administration\u2019s inner circle urging Mr. Trump not to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, which calls for every country in the world to put forth plans to cut emissions that contribute to warming. Mr. Tillerson\u2019s efforts were unsuccessful, and Mr. Trump announced that the United States would go it alone as the only nation not party to the accord.\n\nThe United States cannot formally withdraw until 2020, and Mr. Trump has since made conflicting statements about whether he might reconsider his decision. In a recent interview, Mr. Banks said he believed the president remained open to rejoining the deal. But others have noted that Mr. Trump appears to be hardening against it, at least in his public remarks.\n\nImage Mr. Tillerson, a former oil executive, boarding a plane in Nairobi, Kenya, to return to Washington on Monday. As secretary of state, he urged President Trump not to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. Credit Pool photo by Jonathan Ernst\n\n\u201cWe knocked out the Paris climate accord. Would have been a disaster. Would have been a disaster for our country,\u201d Mr. Trump told the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington last month, calling it a \u201ctotally disastrous, job-killing\u201d agreement.\n\nAs a Kansas member of the House of Representatives, Mr. Pompeo called the Paris Agreement a \u201ccostly burden\u201d to America. He has also questioned the scientific consensus that human activity is causing the planet to warm to dangerous levels.\n\n\u201cThere are scientists who think lots of different things about climate change,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said in a 2013 interview on C-Span. \u201cThere\u2019s some who think we\u2019re warming, there\u2019s some who think we\u2019re cooling, there\u2019s some who think that the last 16 years have shown a pretty stable climate environment.\u201d\n\nAsked again about the science during his C.I.A. confirmation hearing last year, he replied that he stood by his past statements. He also said that, \u201cFrankly, as the director of C.I.A., I would prefer today not to get into the details of the climate debate and science.\u201d\n\nMr. Pompeo\u2019s top funder during his years in Congress was Koch Industries, the petroleum and chemicals conglomerate owned by the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch, who have lobbied for rollbacks in environmental regulation and other libertarian causes.\n\nMr. Pompeo took $375,000 from Koch Industries between 2009 and 2017 and almost $1.2 million from oil and gas companies over all, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, making him one of the top recipients of oil money in the House of Representatives.\n\nIn the 1990s, the Kochs\u2019 venture capital arm also invested in an aeronautics company that Mr. Pompeo started, and later sold, in Wichita, Kan., which is also home to Koch Industries.\n\nIn Congress, Mr. Pompeo backed changes that would benefit the Kochs\u2019 business interests, including eliminating funding for a nationwide registry of greenhouse gas polluters. He also frequently accused the Obama administration of having a \u201cradical climate agenda.\u201d\n\nSince taking the helm of the C.I.A., though, Mr. Pompeo has not spoken publicly about climate change. The agency did help put forward a Worldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community that states that climate change contributes to national security threats.\n\n\u201cI can only hope that in the year of being C.I.A. director, some of that information has found its way up to him,\u201d said Andrew Light, a former State Department climate change negotiator under President Barack Obama. Mr. Light said he did not believe Mr. Pompeo was coming to his new role with an \u201cax to grind\u201d against climate change, but said it was also not likely to be on his agenda.\n\nIf he is confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Pompeo will shape the State Department\u2019s negotiating position at a key United Nations climate change meeting this year in Poland, where nations are expected to discuss their plans for curbing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nHiroko Tabuchi contributed from New York.\n\nLisa Friedman reports on climate and environmental policy in Washington.

(The first black to hold the post was Clifford L. Alexander, appointed by President Carter.) Mr. West succeeded John W. Shannon, the acting secretary, who was charged with shoplifting a blouse and skirt worth $30 from the post exchange at Fort Myer in Virginia. (The charges were dismissed.)\n\nAs secretary in the years after the Gulf War, Mr. West managed base closings and troop reductions that constituted the largest military demobilization since World War II. He also administered the Clinton administration\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy, intended to accommodate gay soldiers.\n\nMr. West clashed with Army brass who objected to his plan to expand the role of women in combat.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThat tenor began to change in recent months, as Dr. Shulkin increasingly butted heads with conservative Trump administration officials over one of the White House\u2019s top policy priorities for the department: the expansion of government-subsidized private health care for veterans, outside the government-run V.A. health system.\n\nThe conservatives came to feel that Dr. Shulkin, who advocated a moderate rewrite of the current private care programs, was an obstacle to their goal.\n\nThe dispute spilled into public over the last month, following a scathing report by department\u2019s inspector general on a business trip that Dr. Shulkin took to Britain and Denmark last year. The report found \u201cserious derelictions\u201d related to the trip and concluded that the secretary spent much of it sightseeing and improperly accepted a gift of Wimbledon tickets.\n\nThe report in hand, Dr. Shulkin\u2019s critics in the White House and the department \u2014 including his two top communications deputies \u2014 worked behind the scenes to try to hasten his ouster. Dr. Shulkin, who disputed the report\u2019s findings, went public with fears that appointees were \u201ctrying to undermine the department from within.\u201d He iced out those he viewed as a threat and essentially became his own one-person press office.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs recently as last week, after a series of meetings with John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, Dr. Shulkin publicly declared victory, hinting that he had the White House\u2019s support to remove officials battling him.\n\nThe secretary appeared to be regaining his footing. He sat at Mr. Trump\u2019s side during a cabinet meeting, and the two men together called Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia, the chairman of the Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee, to pledge their support for his more moderate health care legislation, according to a congressional aide briefed on the call. The secretary maintains the support of top Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nBut top White House officials have only become more irked with the secretary\u2019s penchant for publicly discussing internal politics, and Mr. Trump has begun searching for a replacement.\n\nMr. Perry is seen as a more pliant figure for the veterans affairs position. Unlike Dr. Shulkin, who had run the department\u2019s health care system under President Barack Obama and spent a career in hospital administration, Mr. Perry has no background in health care delivery, but as Texas\u2019 governor, he showed a willingness to experiment.\n\nIf Mr. Trump were to make the move, possible replacements for Mr. Perry could include Ray Washburne, a Dallas entrepreneur and prominent Republican fund-raiser; J.

Cohn, the economics adviser, announced last week that he would step down, following Hope Hicks, the communications director, and Rob Porter, the staff secretary.\n\nIt is tempting to look for larger meaning in the shifting personnel, but the momentum seems to shift by the week or even the day. One faction has the upper hand and then it does not. Mr. Cohn was the \u201cit boy\u201d of the Trump White House early on until he mildly criticized the president\u2019s response to the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. Then he was on the outs. Then he helped pass Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cut plan and his stock was high again. Then he lost last week\u2019s battle over tariffs and he quit.\n\nNot to worry \u2014 even when Mr. Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs banker, announced his departure, Mr. Trump publicly predicted that he would simply go off to make a few hundred million dollars more and then rejoin the administration in one capacity or another.\n\nMr. Tillerson had yet to turn in his State Department decoder ring before speculation turned to who else would be gone soon. What about John F. Kelly, the forever-on-the-bubble White House chief of staff? Or Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the perpetually on-the-way-out national security adviser?\n\nPhoto\n\nMaybe it depends on whom the president can convince to replace them. He said the other day that he could find 10 people for any job opening, but many first-tier Republicans are staying away from this White House or are banned from its premises because of past opposition to Mr. Trump.\n\nStill, he is not wedded to traditional choices as he scans the horizon for fresh staff members. It helps to be good on television, as Mr. Kudlow is, but not to be too good on television, because it might irritate the boss to be shown up.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmong those Mr. Trump enjoys on Fox News is John R. Bolton, the conservative firebrand who served as ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush. Tongues wagged when Mr. Trump met with Mr. Bolton in the White House recently, prompting speculation that he could replace General McMaster.\n\nBut would Mr. Trump bring in Mr. Bolton, among the nation\u2019s leading hawks on North Korea, at the very moment he plans to sit down with Kim Jong-un, the country\u2019s mercurial dictator, for talks aimed at eliminating its nuclear program peacefully? And then there is Mr. Bolton\u2019s famous mustache. Some around Mr. Trump say it bothers him. Can he get over the facial hair?\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s choice of Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, to replace Mr. Tillerson offers something of a window into his approach. Mr. Pompeo found that the key to favor in the Oval Office was engaging Mr. Trump. The president enjoyed his near daily interactions with Mr. Pompeo at his intelligence briefings.\n\nPhoto\n\nBy contrast, he never really connected with Mr. Tillerson, who was used to being a chief executive rather than a glorified staff member. It probably did not help that Mr. Tillerson was overheard after a meeting last summer calling the president a \u201cmoron,\u201d a comment he never denied, although he had a spokeswoman deny it for him. Mr. Trump has likewise been said not to click personally with General McMaster.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s aides said he acted now because he wanted to get a new team in place before the talks with Mr. Kim. But Mr. Pompeo, a skeptic of talks with North Korea, will become secretary of state, while Mr. Tillerson, an advocate of talks with North Korea, will head for the exits.\n\nIn speaking with reporters on the South Lawn before his trip on Tuesday, the president cited clashing views with Mr. Tillerson over the Iran nuclear agreement and other national security issues.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

During his one year in the White House, Trump has so thoroughly warped the space-time continuum of our news cycle that it seems preposterous that any words about his presidency, slapped between covers, won\u2019t have been overtaken by events by the time they appear in print.\n\nYet there are routes to staying power. One comes from Michael Wolff, whose jaw-dropping (and thinly sourced) tales of White House dysfunction in \u201cFire and Fury\u201d cost Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s onetime Svengali, both his media platform and his billionaire patron. Another successful approach is provided by David Frum, whose elegantly written jeremiad \u201cTrumpocracy\u201d will give future historians ample evidence that not all Republicans fell in line behind their party\u2019s president.\n\nWith \u201cIt\u2019s Even Worse Than You Think,\u201d David Cay Johnston has chosen a third, more difficult path. A former New York Times reporter who in 2001 won a Pulitzer Prize for his expos\u00e9s on tax loopholes, Johnston practices a brand of journalism that\u2019s an amalgam of advocacy and forensic accounting. \u201cIt is not enough just to cover politics and controversies,\u201d he writes. \u201cOften the most important news goes unannounced, lying right out in the open in the government documents most journalists are loath to uncover and read.\u201d It\u2019s Johnston\u2019s contention that much of the media\u2019s coverage of Trump \u2014 fixated as it is on the president\u2019s tweets and feuds \u2014 misses the real damage he\u2019s doing to the country. \u201cThe Trump administration deposited political termites throughout the structure of our government,\u201d Johnston argues. \u201cThe endgame is not just a smaller government, which Republicans always say they want, but a weak government.\u201d\n\nJohnston sets out to shine a bright light on these termites. He finds an obvious one in Scott Pruitt, Trump\u2019s man at the Environmental Protection Agency, whose \u201cone-sided approach to E.P.A.\u2019s mandate,\u201d Johnston writes, favors the concerns of the industries it regulates at the expense of the public\u2019s health. Of course, Pruitt has already received considerable media attention. But Johnston uncovers some less well-known termites as well.\n\nImage\n\nHis chapter on the goings-on at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is a textbook example of the sort of green-eyeshade reportage on which he built his formidable reputation. First, Johnston explains how Trump\u2019s decision to force out the chairman left the commission with only two members, short of the three required for a quorum, which meant it was unable to approve \u201c$50 billion worth of energy projects\u201d that would have benefited American workers and consumers. Next, Johnston reports that when Trump finally got around to filling out the agency, he didn\u2019t pick anyone with a consumer-protection background, like the chairman he\u2019d just sacked, instead nominating three new commissioners who all favored the utilities. \u201cCongress created FERC \u2026 to protect families, small-business owners and industry from monopolists and pricing schemes that jack up prices while at the same time ensuring an abundant supply of electricity,\u201d Johnston writes. Under Trump, that mission is being eaten away at.\n\nBut Johnston struggles to find other instances in which Trump is achieving the goal of creating a weak government \u2014 or at least one any weaker than those of his predecessors. Johnston blasts Trump for appointing political supporters rather than career diplomats as ambassadors to strategically important countries \u2014 mentioning, for example, William Francis Hagerty IV, a Tennessee private equity investor who was a Trump campaign fund-raiser and is now ambassador to Japan. But is Hagerty, who once worked as a business consultant in Asia and speaks Japanese, any less qualified for the Tokyo post than Caroline Kennedy, who held it under Obama?\n\nOther times, Johnston seems out of his depth, particularly when he strays from domestic politics. He justifiably criticizes Trump for tilting American foreign policy toward Saudi Arabia in its dispute with its gulf neighbor Qatar. But then Johnston bungles the explanation for why Trump is doing this, suggesting it is because he shares the Saudis\u2019 animus toward Al Jazeera, which broadcasts from Qatar, or because he\u2019s angry that Qatar Airways once moved its New York offices out of Trump Tower. The most likely explanation, which Johnston fails to discuss, is that the Saudis convinced Trump that Qatar is too close to Iran.\n\nTo be sure, some of the book\u2019s shortcomings are a result of deadline pressures, like Johnston\u2019s contention that Trump \u201chas nothing to show in terms of tax legislation.\u201d Most of the \u201cTrump budget cuts\u201d Johnston assails \u2014 like a proposed $6 billion reduction for the National Institutes of Health \u2014 were ultimately rejected in February\u2019s budget deal. But more often than not, \u201cIt\u2019s Even Worse Than You Think\u201d reads like a retelling of the various politics and controversies \u2014 from Sean Spicer lying about the crowd size at the Inauguration to the president blaming hurricane victims in Puerto Rico for not helping themselves \u2014 that dominated the media\u2019s coverage of Trump\u2019s first year in office. The result is an unsatisfying rehash.\n\nAlthough Johnston has been writing about Trump for almost three decades, he doesn\u2019t offer any new or keen insights into Trump\u2019s psychology and character. Unlike the gifted polemicist Frum, Johnston is a clunky writer whose passion only serves to produce such groaners as: \u201cCutting avenues to success for poor, working-class and even middle-class young people is a Make America Worse policy.\u201d While Wolff features juicy quotes from close Trump aides likening the president to a child or accusing his eldest son of treason, Johnston favors dry denunciations of Trump from government ethics scolds who\u2019ve offered the same words to countless newspapers and public radio shows in the past year.\n\nIndeed, \u201cIt\u2019s Even Worse Than You Think\u201d winds up making the opposite point of the one Johnston intends: In the realm of policy, what the Trump administration is doing to America, so far at least, is not as horrible as you feared.", "keywords": ["inside", "eating", "johnston", "doing", "qatar", "writes", "trump", "think", "termites", "politics", "worse", "away", "trumps"], "polarity": 0.03247594997594997, "subjectivity": 0.4748272406605741},

Last year, Mr. Trump and Secretary of State Rex W.

Admiral Ziemer said that decreased American funding could be an opportunity for other countries like Britain and Japan to \u201cstep up to the plate.\u201d\n\nCritics of such multinational agreements agree.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019re getting bang for our buck with World Health,\u201d Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, said of the World Health Organization\u2019s investment in the partnership during a public health hearing on Capitol Hill in January.

But the shift disrupts the delicate balance of power in the administration\u2019s national security team.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Tillerson and Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, had run something of a tag team to keep the president in check, finding common ground on policies from the Middle East to East Asia before stepping into the Situation Room. For the better part of a year, that put Mr. Trump in the position of having to overcome their unified advice, which also was sometimes aligned with the White House national security adviser, H. R. McMaster.\n\nOne senior administration official who often sat in the backbenches of those meetings last week described Mr. Trump\u2019s growing frustration at being hemmed in by his two principal national security cabinet members.\n\nThat seems particularly true on Iran, and Mr. Trump singled out that issue on Tuesday as he was preparing to leave for California. He said he and Mr. Tillerson \u201cdisagree on things.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the Iran deal \u2014 I think it\u2019s terrible. I guess he thought it was O.K.,\u201d the president said, referring to Mr. Tillerson. \u201cI wanted to either break it or do something. And he felt a little bit differently.\u201d\n\nHis comments are certain to alarm European allies who have spent the last few days negotiating with Mr. Tillerson\u2019s closest aide, Brian Hook, on a way to add to the agreement that limited Iran\u2019s nuclear program, rather than reopen or scrap the deal. Those moves were intended to keep Mr. Trump from ditching the agreement in mid-May, when he faces a deadline over continued suspension of American nuclear-related sanctions on Iran.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe first Mr. Hook heard of Mr. Tillerson\u2019s ouster was when a reporter for The New York Times called him for comment on Tuesday morning, shortly after the secretary\u2019s 405-day tenure was ended by presidential tweet.\n\nMr. Tillerson\u2019s denouement seemed rife with the symbolism of the change to come. After Mr. Trump was revealed to have used a vulgarity to disparage several African nations, he dispatched Mr. Tillerson on a lengthy trip to the continent last week to make it up to them.\n\nBut while the secretary was away, Mr. Trump agreed to the meeting with Mr. Kim, catching Mr. Tillerson by surprise \u2014 even though he was the one who had long been arguing for opening up a diplomatic channel to North Korea. While in Africa, Mr. Tillerson took a day off to recover from what the State Department said was exhaustion from long nights catching up by phone with Washington.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThen he got food poisoning, cut his travels short, and was fired upon landing in the United States.\n\nIt was clear in recent months that Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Trump were barely talking. The frequent dinners the chief diplomat shared with the president last spring, when the two men were forming their views of how to approach the world, had ended.\n\nMr. Trump had hired Mr. Tillerson because he liked his record of profits and expansion at Exxon, and thought his mane of white hair gave him the look of a secretary of state. But more recently, the president told aides he thought Mr. Tillerson was \u201cweak\u201d \u2014 the ultimate insult in Mr. Trump\u2019s world. His affinity for Mr. Pompeo grew as the men bonded over intelligence warnings and authorizations for covert actions.\n\nMr. Pompeo\u2019s rise will solve one central problem in American diplomacy over the past year: When Mr. Tillerson spoke, few thought he was speaking on behalf of the president.\n\n\u201cIt creates the possibility that someone who is up to speed with the issues, and has a comfortable working relationship with the president, is now in the chair,\u201d said Richard Haass, who served several Republicans and Democrats in senior State Department and National Security Council positions.\n\nAmerica\u2019s interlocutors, Mr. Haass added, will now believe the secretary of state \u201cis speaking with the power and backing of the president.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe question is whether, when President Trump speaks, it sounds like he has consulted his secretary of state,\u201d Mr. Haass, now the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said in a call from India.\n\nThe one arena where Mr. Pompeo\u2019s views are still a mystery is Russia. While serving in Congress, he was a critic of President Vladimir V. Putin. As C.I.A. director, Mr. Pompeo said he believed intelligence assessments that Mr. Putin was behind the effort to influence the 2016 election \u2014 even though Mr. Trump has dismissed those reports for fear it would undercut the legitimacy of his election.\n\nMr. Pompeo has not, however, gone the next step to describe what he thought the United States should do to counter Russia\u2019s actions.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn contrast, Mr. Tillerson had let known his increasing concern about Russia\u2019s activities, and even about Mr. Putin, who famously presented him with an award for his deals with Russia while at Exxon. On Monday, his last day as secretary of state, he agreed with the British government that Russia was most likely behind the nerve gas attack on a Russian living in England \u2014 while the White House has hedged about Russia\u2019s responsibilities. Mr. Pompeo\u2019s views are not known.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest unknown in the ascension of Mr. Pompeo is how it will affect any negotiations with North Korea.\n\nHe has warned many times, since last summer, that Mr. Kim is \u201ca few months\u201d away from acquiring the ability to strike the United States with a nuclear weapon. That is based on a calculation of how long it will take the North to solve the final problems of designing a warhead that can survive re-entry into the atmosphere atop an intercontinental missile.\n\nBut Mr. Pompeo has also been in charge of an active covert campaign against the North, which he has alluded to elliptically on several occasions. The question now is whether that covert effort \u2014 believed to include sabotage of North Korea\u2019s supply chain and renewed cyberattacks on its missile and nuclear programs \u2014 will buy Mr. Trump enough time, and leverage, to make a negotiation work.\n\nNo agency has been more skeptical about the chances of Mr. Kim\u2019s giving up his arsenal than the C.I.A. itself, under Mr. Pompeo.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a presentation last fall at George Washington University, one of the agency\u2019s top Korea analysts said that in the C.I.A.\u2019s view, no amount of sanctions pressure would persuade Mr. Kim that it was worth giving up the weapons that he believes are his only defense from having his country overrun by the United States and its allies.\n\nAssociates of Mr. Pompeo say he shares that view \u2014 which would suggest that while he may soon be running the North Korea negotiations, his expectations of success are limited.\n\nIn retrospect, Tuesday\u2019s shift could explain some comments Mr. Pompeo made over the weekend. In interviews on Fox and CBS, he said he had spent part of the weekend reviewing the C.I.A.\u2019s internal history of American negotiations with North Korea for the past quarter-century. That would have been an odd way for a C.I.A. director to spend his reading time; it makes a lot of sense for a future secretary of state.", "keywords": ["fits", "mr", "thought", "tillerson", "north", "secretary", "reading", "trump", "worldview", "pompeo", "foreign", "state", "policy", "president", "presidents"], "polarity": 0.049069609468545654, "subjectivity": 0.3348360504743484},

He shares Mr. Trump\u2019s view that the nuclear agreement with Tehran is deeply flawed. Shortly after Mr. Trump was elected, Mr. Pompeo wrote on Twitter, \u201cI look forward to rolling back this disastrous deal with the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terrorism.\u201d\n\nHe has not moderated his messaging at the C.I.A. Five months ago, he called Iran a \u201cdespotic theocracy\u201d and \u201ca pernicious empire that is expanding its power and influence across the Middle East.\u201d\n\nIn October, he slipped up in discussing the volatile issue of Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election, claiming that American intelligence agencies had concluded that the meddling did not affect the outcome. In fact, the agencies did not give an opinion on the effect of the Russian hacking, leaking and propaganda. The agency issued a corrective statement and Mr. Pompeo has not repeated the mistake.\n\nDuring Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, Mr. Pompeo publicly welcomed WikiLeaks\u2019 release of Democratic emails hacked and leaked by Russia. But at the C.I.A., he has denounced the group, which published secret documents on the agency\u2019s hacking last year, as \u201ca nonstate hostile intelligence service.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe has had to juggle some political grenades.

The two men had a polite meeting, but Mr. Pompeo did not change his view that Russia was responsible.\n\nRepresentative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, called his former House colleague \u201chard-working and intelligent and willing to hear different points of view.\u201d But he added a cautionary note, saying Mr. Pompeo \u201chas not always been willing to stand up to the president, particularly when Trump has questioned the intelligence community\u2019s conclusions on Russia, and we will need the new secretary to be willing to speak hard truths to the president.\u201d\n\nOn covert action, though the details of most operations remain secret, Mr. Pompeo has taken an aggressive approach. In Afghanistan, the agency has sent small teams of highly experienced officers and contractors alongside Afghan troops to hunt and kill Taliban militants across the country. This marks a shift for the C.I.A. in Afghanistan, where the agency had primarily focused on Al Qaeda and on helping the Afghan spy services.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t perform our mission if we\u2019re not aggressive,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said last fall in a speech in Texas. \u201cThis is unforgiving, relentless. You pick the word. Every minute, we have to be focused on crushing our enemies.\u201d\n\nMr. Pompeo, who served as a tank commander in the Army in Germany and founded an aerospace company, would be one of the most conservative secretaries of state in history. He was an outspoken critic of Hillary Clinton on her handling of the terrorist attack on the American diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya, and co-wrote an addendum to the House Benghazi committee\u2019s report because he felt it did not go far enough. He has said that Edward J. Snowden, who gave an archive of secret National Security Agency documents to journalists, should get the death penalty.\n\nMr. Pompeo brought a taste of America\u2019s domestic culture wars into the agency, laying plans to hire chaplains for the agency, which until now has typically treated religion as a private matter. Officials said that the idea originated during a breakfast Mr. Pompeo had at the C.I.A. with Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, a conservative advocacy group that opposes gay rights, abortion and even divorce \u2014 a common hazard for C.I.A. officers working in operations overseas.\n\nHis hard line against jihadist terrorism has sometimes spilled over into condemnation of Muslims more broadly, as in 2013, when he said American Muslim leaders had not been sufficiently outspoken in denouncing the Boston Marathon bombing, making them \u201cpotentially complicit in these acts.\u201d\n\nSuch statements outraged groups like Muslim Advocates, which urged the Senate on Tuesday not to confirm Mr. Pompeo, whom it said had \u201cmade a career of bigotry and hate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA longtime beneficiary of conservative superdonors Charles G. and David H.

I guess he \u2014 it was O.K. I wanted to either break it or do something. And he felt a little bit differently.\n\nSo we were not really thinking the same.

I made the North Korea decision with consultation from many people but I made that decision by myself. I actually got along well with Rex. But really it was a different mind-set.

A senior administration official defended the process and said that the White House had consistently coordinated with the Justice Department. In the weeks leading up to Mr. Trump\u2019s first calls to ban bump stocks, the official said, the White House knew the bureau was open to revisiting a ban.\n\nYet in tweets, public remarks and statements, Mr. Trump upended the time-consuming, often-overlooked federal rule-making process, which requires coordination among multiple agencies. The president dismissed it as \u201clong and complicated,\u201d vowing that bump stocks would be banned and that the legal review was almost finished.\n\n\u201cI expect that these critical regulations will be finalized, Jeff, very soon,\u201d Trump said in the days after the Florida shooting, directly addressing Mr. Sessions while the agency was continuing its review.\n\nAs recently as last week, the public positions of the president and the bureau were out of sync. Mr. Trump announced that the \u201clegal papers\u201d to ban bump stocks were nearly completed and said the devices would soon be \u201cgone.\u201d That same day, bureau officials said that the agency was still reviewing the issue, and that no final determination had been made.\n\nTraditionally, the bureau would study existing statutes, decide that the law permits it to regulate bump stocks and then submit a proposed rule to the Justice Department. The deputy attorney general\u2019s office would make modifications before the budget office reviewed and approved the rule change, and it would then be published in the Federal Register.\n\nThe regulation of bump stocks has strayed from that pattern. The bureau determined in 2010 that it could not regulate the devices because they could not be defined as machine guns, which are regulated under the National Firearms Act, the law that regulates firearms in the United States. To prohibit bump stocks, the agency had to contradict that earlier position, essentially saying the statute had not changed but could be read differently to include such a ban.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Justice Department and A.T.F. officials privately stuck by their earlier conclusion that they could not outlaw bump stocks, but with little appetite to tackle gun policy in Congress, Mr. Sessions asked the A.T.F. to review its determination.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAgencies periodically scrutinize earlier rulings and change interpretations. What set apart the bump stock evaluation, according to former bureau officials, was Mr. Trump\u2019s overt political pressure.\n\n\u201cNo disrespect intended, but I\u2019m sure President Trump has no idea what exactly the authority is for A.T.F. or the D.O.J. to ban these things,\u201d said Bradley A. Buckles, who was the head of the bureau from 1999 to 2004. \u201cIn all honesty, he doesn\u2019t know what his authority is in that regard.\u201d\n\nAnd in altering its 2010 interpretation made under former President Barack Obama, the bureau could be subject to lawsuits that tie up a bump stock ban in the courts.\n\n\u201cThe Justice Department and the A.T.F. are going to get sued, and Trump is going to get flak,\u201d said Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law in Houston. \u201cObama was correct in his interpretation of the statute. If you want to ban bump stocks, it has to be done through Congress.\u201d\n\nThe apparent reversal on bump stocks appears to be more political than legal, said Rick Vasquez, a former A.T.F. official who supervised the bureau\u2019s prior determination on bump stocks.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re basically playing games with the regulations and the law right now just to make a political statement,\u201d he said.\n\nOther presidents have also influenced Justice Department rule making to help their preferred policies come into fruition, then watched as those rules became fodder for lawsuits. Under Mr. Obama, the Justice Department created the legal underpinnings to protect undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children after Congress failed to address the issue. That program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, was the subject of multiple lawsuits.\n\nIf bump stock bans are approved, as expected, questions remain on how the rule will be enforced, including whether it will apply to purchases before a ban would be instituted.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Trump continued to publicly press for a ban. \u201cBump Stocks,\u201d he tweeted, \u201cwill soon be out.\u201d", "keywords": ["department", "mr", "revisits", "justice", "pressured", "ban", "atf", "law", "rules", "bump", "trump", "stock", "stocks", "bureau"], "polarity": 0.04037232928361961, "subjectivity": 0.30169552669552674},

In New York City, middle and high school students may walk out of class with approval from a parent, such as with a permission slip, but elementary school students cannot leave unless a parent or guardian comes to check them out.\n\nAt Woods Cross Elementary School in Woods Cross, Utah, students will be allowed to leave class at 10 a.m. and go to the gym for 17 minutes, the same starting time and duration (one minute for every victim in Parkland, Fla.) as other walkouts around the country. Parents may also check them out of the school during that time, and they will not be penalized.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re giving them an opportunity to express their First Amendment rights in a safe place,\u201d said Rachel Peterson, a physical education teacher at the school who is also safety commissioner for the state board of the Utah PTA.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn suburban Nashville, David L. Snowden, director of schools for the Franklin Special School District, sent an email to families saying that the district had decided that it would not be appropriate for students in its elementary schools, which run through fourth grade, to participate in the walkout, but that students in grades five and up could join.\n\nIn an interview, Dr. Snowden said he was not concerned that very young children would be frightened by the walkout, only that they would not understand what it was about. \u201cSometimes I think when you\u2019re teaching children, especially younger children, you try to take into consideration, will there be a full understanding of what they\u2019re doing and why they\u2019re doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cJust to walk out of class for 17 minutes, I\u2019m not sure what that is really teaching.\u201d\n\nEven within Akron\u2019s 50-school district, agendas for Wednesday differed markedly from school to school. At Firestone Park Elementary, students were expected to read a poem about peace. At Pfeiffer Elementary, students would be reviewing safety procedures. And at Robinson Community Learning Center there were no plans at all \u2014 students had not expressed an interest, according to the district.\n\nElise Cappella, a clinical psychologist and associate professor at New York University\u2019s Steinhardt School, said there was a difference between what the youngest students \u2014 from kindergarten to second grade \u2014 and older children could understand. While not advocating any particular stance, she said: \u201cSchools could make the decision that kids in kindergarten through second grade are not provided the opportunity to walk out. They are cognitively, socially, emotionally younger. They may feel more fear about it and less understanding.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nChildren in the third grade and up, she said, will be more likely to be exposed to news and hear their parents talking about it. \u201cThey are reaching a point where having something that\u2019s potentially positive and productive to do that makes them feel a sense of agency and safety could be a good thing,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Cappella said that whether elementary schools decided to participate in the protest or not, the goal should be to project a sense of community to their students.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Canavan, the schools superintendent in Harford County, Md., said that a walkout \u201cpresents, paradoxically, a threat to student safety, as word of the walkout has been widely disseminated and students who go outside could become more vulnerable.\u201d\n\nInstead, Ms. Canavan said, her district would offer \u201ca learning module that will provide students with an opportunity to share their feelings about recent events across the nation and will allow them to speak about solutions in a structured way.\u201d\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, which has offered training to students planning to participate in the walkouts, said that districts can discipline students under attendance guidelines.\n\n\u201cBut what they can\u2019t do,\u201d the A.C.L.U. wrote in a guide for student protesters, \u201cis discipline you more harshly because of the political nature of or the message behind your action.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven some schools where demonstrations are being allowed are being careful about the tone.\n\nMs. Peterson, of Woods Cross in Utah, said that there was no program planned for the assembly \u2014 the students would be able to express themselves as long as they were not rowdy or disruptive. \u201cWe are teachers and not necessarily there to make a political statement in that time,\u201d she said. \u201cWhatever is decided by students in that time and space, we will allow it to happen as long as it is peaceable and respectful.\u201d\n\nIf some students who stayed behind expressed surprise or bafflement at their classmates leaving the room, she said, teachers would use their own tact and judgment about how to explain it. \u201cThe way I would word it is that some kids are walking out to show support for lessening school violence, in honor of the people in Florida,\u201d Ms. Peterson said.\n\nBut in Alexandria, Va., when one school decided that fifth graders could join the walkout if their parents signed them out, a parent lodged her own form of protest.\n\n\u201cMy elementary school has 5-year-olds in it,\u201d the parent, Julie Gunlock, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning Independent Women\u2019s Forum, said in an interview. \u201cSome of my friends, their kids are much younger than a fifth grader. And it\u2019s frightening to them.\u201d\n\nMaeva Lile, 11, one of the fifth-grade organizers at Case Elementary in Akron, said that most of her friends were aware of the gun-control debate and thought that AR-15s, the powerful rifle used in Parkland and other mass shootings, should not be legal. But she said her class did not want to debate the Second Amendment, and so its posters will simply honor the students killed in Parkland with their names.\n\nStill, she thought it was time for children to do something. \u201cAdults have been protesting against things,\u201d she said on Monday, \u201cbut nothing has changed that much.\u201d", "keywords": ["national", "elementary", "walk", "gunviolence", "schools", "students", "tests", "safety", "protest", "school", "walkout", "young", "class", "children", "york"], "polarity": 0.11565649127504798, "subjectivity": 0.41637851266717246},

Conservatives were using the Trump administration\u2019s effort to rein in federal overreach to reverse policies designed to protect against what the Obama administration had seen as discriminatory practices.\n\nThe \u201cRethink Discipline,\u201d package that Mr. Trump\u2019s commission will examine includes guidance that the Obama administration issued on the legal limitations on the use of restraints and seclusion, corporal punishment and equity for special education students.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Teachers who sought suspensions or expulsions of minority students were painted as racists, conservatives maintained.\n\n\u201cEvidence is mounting that efforts to fight the school-to-prison pipeline is creating a school climate catastrophe and has if anything put at-risk students at greater risk,\u201d said Max Eden, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, who argued that teacher bias was not the driving force behind school discipline.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut proponents argued that racial bias was well documented.\n\nWhen the guidance was issued, federal data found that African-American students without disabilities were more than three times as likely as their white peers without disabilities to be expelled or suspended, and that more than 50 percent of students who were involved in school-related arrests or who were referred to law enforcement were Hispanic or African-American.\n\n\u201cChildren\u2019s safety also includes protection from oppression and bigotry and injustice,\u201d Daniel J. Losen, director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies at the University of California at Los Angeles\u2019s Civil Rights Project, wrote in testimony to the Civil Rights Commission. \u201cFear-mongering and rhetoric that criminalizes youth of color, children from poor families and children with disabilities should not be tolerated.\u201d\n\nThe Education and Justice Departments wrote in a 2014 Dear Colleague letter that discipline disparities could be caused by a range of factors, but the statistics in the federal data \u201care not explained by more frequent or more serious misbehavior by students of color.\u201d The departments also noted that several civil rights investigations had verified that minority students were disciplined more harshly than their white peers for the same infractions.\n\n\u201cIn short, racial discrimination in school discipline is a real problem,\u201d the guidance said.\n\nIn recent months, Ms. DeVos has said change will be coming. She has already moved to rescind a regulation that protects against racial disparities in special education placements. Her goal, she said last month, was to be \u201csensitive to all of the parties involved.\u201d\n\nIn a bruising interview on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on Sunday, Ms. DeVos said that the disproportionate discipline issue \u201ccomes down to individual kids.\u201d She declined to say whether she believed that black students disciplined more harshly for the same infraction were the victims of institutional racism.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re studying it carefully and are committed to making sure students have opportunity to learn in safe and nurturing environments,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. DeVos\u2019s office for civil rights also announced that it would scale back the scope of investigations, reversing an approach taken under the Obama administration to conduct exhaustive reviews of school districts\u2019 practices and data when a discrimination complaint was filed.\n\nBut Ms. DeVos\u2019s own administration has continued to find racial disparities. In November, the Education Department found that the Loleta Union Elementary School District in California doled out harsher treatment to Native American students than their white peers.

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/upshot/needle-forecast-pennsylvania-special-election.html", "text": "Advertisement\n\nThe Needle\u2019s Back. Maybe This Time, It Will Really Be Wrong. And yes, it could be wrong. Or \u201cwrong.\u201d To understand why, it\u2019s important to understand how our forecast works.\n\nImage\n\nUpdate: The polls have closed in Pennsylvania. Check out our live results page.\n\nThere was only one prediction that we were prepared to make around 9:45 p.m. on the night of the Alabama special election in December: If Roy Moore won, it would have been the end of our live forecast dial \u2014 affectionately or grudgingly known as the needle.\n\nThe Upshot writes about data and policy, and the needle is our way of following live election results and adjusting for the votes that have yet to be counted.\n\nAt that point, a victory for Mr. Moore would have been no surprise for those watching returns on television or online. He held a lead of 8.3 percentage points with two-thirds of precincts counted. But the needle was unconvinced. Doug Jones, the Democratic candidate, had a 62 percent chance to win, according to our estimates.\n\nFor many careful consumers of news and journalism, a loss for Mr. Jones would have been an incontrovertible failure for our forecast. And it would have come on the heels of the needle\u2019s performance in the 2016 election, which was widely, though wrongly, perceived as a failure. The reaction would have been scathing.\n\nIn the end, Mr. Jones prevailed. \u201cAll hail the needle\u201d resounded on liberal Twitter. But the needle could have very easily been \u201cwrong,\u201d if \u201cwrong\u201d meant the leading candidate went on to lose.\n\nThe reaction after Alabama weighed on our thinking as we considered whether to publish a forecast for the special election on Tuesday in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th Congressional District.\n\nIt was sobering to see the triumphant coverage of the needle after Alabama, especially compared with how people reacted after the presidential race. Yes, it forecast a win for Mr. Jones before many others did. But if anything, it was as close to \u201cwrong\u201d as it had ever been in a high-profile setting: For five minutes, it showed Mr. Jones favored to win by eight points. (He went on to win by about 1.5 points.)\n\nBy our standards, the live forecast actually performed much better on election night in 2016, when it showed Donald J. Trump had a greater than 95 percent chance of winning hours before the race was called.\n\nYes, that night started with Hillary Clinton as a favorite, based on pre-election polls that had given Mrs. Clinton a clear but modest lead. But the needle makes election night forecasts, not pre-election forecasts. It had to start somewhere, and it merely inherited Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presumed edge.\n\nThe needle did its job: It swung swiftly when votes from Midwestern battleground states began to be counted. It gave Mr. Trump the edge in Pennsylvania, even when Mrs. Clinton had a double-digit lead in the state. It performed exactly as we had hoped and, frankly, if more readers and journalists were conservatives, they would have seen it just as they saw it in Alabama: as the leading indicator of a thrilling upset.\n\nWith that history, do we really want to risk being \u201cwrong\u201d in a lower-profile special election?\n\nRight or wrong, we\u2019re doing it anyway.\n\nWhy the Needle\n\nIncomplete election results are often deeply unrepresentative. That was certainly the case in Alabama. The state\u2019s predominantly white, rural and Republican counties were among the first to report, giving Mr. Moore a big but unsustainable lead.\n\nMany sophisticated analysts would have recognized that Mr. Jones was poised to close the gap. Television viewers might have gotten a sense of Mr. Jones\u2019s route to victory from on-air analysts like MSNBC\u2019s Steve Kornacki or CNN\u2019s John King, who pointed to the remaining Democratic vote in Montgomery and Birmingham. Network decision desks certainly knew: They have their own internal forecasts, which will probably compete with the needle one day, perhaps even as soon as this year\u2019s midterm elections. Maybe they\u2019ll put the needle out of business.\n\nOnline viewers looking at a traditional election results page, on the other hand, would have had no idea, unless they knew Alabama\u2019s political geography well enough to figure it out for themselves.\n\nOur live forecast is just a formal means to do for online viewers what analysts like Mr. Kornacki or Mr. King have been doing for television viewers for years. It looks at where votes remain to be counted, and makes an educated guess about how those votes will break based on past election results and trends evident in initial returns.\n\nThere is an argument that all of this is a waste of time: After all, we\u2019ll know the actual result soon enough. We are sympathetic to that idea, but if people are going to follow election night results online \u2014 and they do, by the millions \u2014 they ought to have the context to understand them. In 2016, that meant letting readers know Mr. Trump was an overwhelming favorite as soon as we knew.\n\nThis time, the special election in Pennsylvania has near-optimal conditions for a needle. Election officials say that precinct-level results will be available. There is also no meaningful early vote, which can often be deeply unrepresentative. This is just about the best possible environment to make quick and relatively confident inferences about the favorite.\n\nWe do have one big concern: A county might be slow to publish precinct results, or might entirely fail to do so. If the precinct data falls too far behind the county-level results from The Associated Press, we might even have to turn the needle off. But that\u2019s out of our hands.\n\nWhy the Needle Is Risky\n\nDespite these advantages, the needle could easily be \u201cwrong\u201d tonight, at least if the measure of right or wrong is whether the leading candidate goes on to win.\n\nThe challenge boils down to two unavoidable problems: Our initial expectations for how a place might vote are never perfect, and initial results are never perfectly representative.\n\nTo understand, it\u2019s worth taking a moment to consider how the needle works. Simply put, it estimates the final result by looking at what votes are left to be counted.\n\nIt starts with a weakly held assumption about the turnout and vote choice of every precinct or county. We call that set of assumptions a baseline. As votes are tabulated, the needle compares the returns with the prior baseline. If the reported vote share or turnout differs from our initial expectations, the needle will assume that similar outstanding areas will differ from our expectations in a similar manner.\n\nAs the night progresses, the needle will have more and more data to work with. But early on, issues with the baseline are a big factor.\n\nImagine, for instance, that our baseline tonight underestimates the final performance of the Democrat, Conor Lamb, in white working-class areas but overestimates him in well-educated suburbs. If the first results are from white working-class areas, the needle will tick to the left as Mr. Lamb beats expectations. The Republican, Rick Saccone, would eventually counter in the suburbs, but at the beginning of the night there would be no way to know.\n\nThe bigger danger to the needle is representativeness: the possibility that the reported results are particularly good for one candidate, even after considering the political and demographic characteristics of the reported areas.\n\nOne obvious example is the early vote, which often reports first and leans Democratic. This problem is pretty easy to fix if the state reports the absentee or early vote separately. We used this separate data in recent elections in Virginia and Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District. Otherwise, it\u2019s very hard to correct. Fortunately, this is not a factor in Pennsylvania.\n\nA less obvious example is the sequencing of the results: A candidate\u2019s best or worst areas could report first. After all, there\u2019s always going to be somewhere with surprising results. If the worst or best news for a party comes first, the needle could mislead \u2014 even for a long time.\n\nTo some extent, this happened in Alabama. The Republicans had a big turnout problem, but for a few minutes our forecast believed it was catastrophic, since the first counties to complete their count included some of the weakest Republican turnouts of the night. Mr. Jones briefly soared in our estimate. The magnitude of our error at that point \u2014 nearly seven points \u2014 was huge, even if brief.\n\nWhy the Needle Will Be \u2018Wrong\u2019\n\nBut as perilous as Mr. Jones\u2019s fleeting eight-point lead was for The Upshot , or as frustrating as Mrs. Clinton\u2019s initial edge may have been for her supporters, the needle hasn\u2019t yet faced its real worst-case scenarios.\n\nThe needle\u2019s worst nightmare will come at the end of a night, not the beginning.\n\nWith so much data already in by that time, unrepresentative data at the end of a night can be a big surprise. It could mean that one candidate loses a projected lead in the final returns, perhaps even after leading the whole night.\n\nImagine, for instance, that Fayette County (where Republicans had their worst turnout in Alabama, at just 63 percent of our expectations) was the last county to finish its count, rather than the fourth earliest. And imagine that it wasn\u2019t a small county, but a large metropolitan one, with 200,000 voters initially expected. In this hypothetical, the final turnout would be just 126,000 votes, nearly 80,000 short of initial expectations and probably still 50,000 short of what we would have expected by the end of the night. Mr. Moore won Fayette County by a 50-point margin, so the turnout error would have been worth a net of 25,000 votes. That\u2019s a two-point swing in the projected statewide popular vote that we would learn about only in the final moments of the race.\n\nIf the needle lives long enough, one night the needle will suggest Democrats are poised to win, even as Republicans hold a lead in the tabulated vote. In the end, the Republican candidate will survive as a major urban center doesn\u2019t yield as many votes as the needle imagined. Or alternately, the Republican will be favored all night, only to be overtaken because of an unexpectedly large Democratic turnout.\n\nKeep these possibilities in mind if one candidate tonight has a 90 percent chance of victory at some point. You won\u2019t have any way of knowing whether the 10 percent chance of an upset is about to become a reality; know only that such a thing could really happen. If an upset wasn\u2019t a possibility, the model would assess a 100 percent chance of victory. And if the needle was always \u201cright,\u201d then our probabilities would be quite wrong.\n\nUltimately, it is impossible to prevent the needle from being \u201cwrong.\u201d It is an inevitability, if the needle is put to work in enough elections. The challenge is to communicate the possibility of an upset, for as long as the possibility remains. Traditionally, we have used probabilities to do so, but we increasingly doubt whether this helps readers understand the uncertainty.\n\nThis was evident before the result of the 2016 election, and as a result we tried something new: a jitter, where the needle quivered to reflect the uncertainty around the forecast. Although many readers disliked it, the jitter reflected an earnest attempt to give tangible meaning to abstract probabilities. Nonetheless, we turned the jitter off for all of our 2017 forecasts.\n\nTonight, readers will have the option to turn the jitter off. We expect that some readers will opt to do so, but remember this: Switching it off only hides the uncertainty \u2014 it doesn\u2019t make it go away.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s not over until the race is called.\n\nNate Cohn is a domestic correspondent for The Upshot.

Irrationality is considered to be a negative quality (except perhaps by Dadaists); so is unfairness.\n\nFor those of us to wish to understand the way Bannon is manipulating language here, and to what end, it is important to note what he is not doing. It is typical for far-right politicians who want to attract racist, xenophobic or nativist voters to attempt to provide at least the pretense of reasons, invariably shoddy ones, for animus against racial minorities, immigrants, or foreigners.\n\nIn the United States, President Trump regularly connects individual crimes or criminal gangs with immigration in an effort to more broadly establish a link between immigrants with crime in the public consciousness. Though studies have shown that immigrants, both legal and illegal, are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans, Trump continues to make such claims (his statement that immigrants bring \u201ctremendous amounts of crime\u201d received a score of \u201cfour Pinocchios\u201d from fact-checkers).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSimilarly bizarre false claims are made by non-American far-right politicians, who also regularly engage in anti-Semitic innuendo. There is a natural next step to using innuendo and the manufacturing of reasons to justify racism and xenophobia \u2014 namely to drop the facade altogether. Bannon is urging the adoption of an irrational bias against racial minorities, immigrants and foreigners, one that does not require reasons, even bad ones, to support it.

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/12/opinion/devos-school-prison-pipeline.html", "text": "Photo\n\nOn Sunday evening, CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d broadcast an interview that Lesley Stahl conducted with Betsy DeVos, Donald Trump\u2019s education secretary and one of the richest members of his very rich cabinet. It was overwhelmingly seen as a disaster for DeVos, who struggled to answer very basic questions. She couldn\u2019t say, for example, why schools in Michigan, her home state, have largely gotten worse since the widespread introduction of the school choice policies she lobbied for. When Stahl asked whether, as secretary, she\u2019d ever visited a failing school to find out what went wrong, DeVos said, \u201cI have not intentionally visited schools that are underperforming.\u201d\n\nLike many things in Trump\u2019s administration, this performance was shocking but not surprising. Before becoming secretary of education, DeVos had never worked as an educator or a policymaker; she was a donor to education reform efforts favored by the right, such as school choice and vouchers. Her confirmation hearings last year were an embarrassment. She appeared to be unfamiliar with the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, a federal civil rights law. After taking office, she described historically black universities and colleges, founded in response to segregation, as \u201cpioneers when it comes to school choice.\u201d\n\nAs this comment suggested, DeVos is, at best, oblivious about race. That obliviousness \u2014 or worse \u2014 is behind one of the more disturbing moments in her \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview. In a sick irony, some on the right would use the recent school shooting in Parkland, Fla. \u2014 allegedly committed by a young man who carved swastikas into the magazines for his semiautomatic rifle \u2014 as a pretext to roll back civil rights protections for students of color. On \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d DeVos, whom Trump has chosen to lead his new school safety commission, appeared to signal she\u2019s on board.\n\nTo understand how, we need to start with a letter that Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, sent to DeVos and Attorney General Jeff Sessions on March 5 about the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRubio referred to a 2014 Barack Obama-era directive, known as the Dear Colleague Letter on the Nondiscriminatory Administration of School Discipline, intended to address the so-called school-to-prison pipeline, in which disadvantaged students are funneled into the criminal justice system for misbehaving at school. The Dear Colleague Letter said school personnel must \u201cunderstand that they, rather than school resource officers and other security or law enforcement personnel, are responsible for administering routine student discipline.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

Her story\u2019s message about turning adversity into strength sticks with me always.\n\n\u2014 MaiLei Meyers\n\nThe first time I saw gay men represented in film, who felt real and relatable, was in \u201cMy Beautiful Laundrette.\u201d Being gay isn\u2019t what the movie was about, these two characters just were, and that one was brown and the other white and working class made it even better.\n\n\u2014 Michael Ginther\n\n\u201cDrumline,\u201d featuring Nick Cannon, in 2002 and \u201cYou Got Served\u201d in 2004.

But she is not American and I\u2019m not at all a Bond woman. I grew up watching movies and I love the old Hollywood movies especially, but it makes me sad to realize that Hollywood\u2019s portrayal of Asians has been mocking or missing for most of its history.

He argued that biological differences and not a lack of opportunity explained the shortage of women in leadership and technical positions.\n\nGoogle fired Mr. Damore. He filed a lawsuit in January with another former employee, claiming that the company discriminates against white men with conservative views. In a separate lawsuit, a former recruiter for YouTube sued Google because, he said, he was fired for resisting a mandate to hire only diverse \u2014 female or black and Latino \u2014 candidates.\n\nGoogle\u2019s handling of the issue was also upsetting to Mr. Damore\u2019s critics. In another lawsuit filed last month, a former Google employee said he was fired because he was too outspoken in advocating diversity and for spending too much time on \u201csocial activism.\u201d\n\nInside Google, vocal diversity proponents say they are the targets of a small group of employees who are sympathetic to Mr. Damore. In some cases, screenshots of comments made on an internal social network were leaked to online forums frequented by right-wing groups, which searched for and published personal information like home addresses and phone numbers of the Google employees, they said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2015, Google started an internal program called Respect@, which includes a way for employees to anonymously report complaints of inappropriate behavior by co-workers. Some diversity supporters say other employees are taking advantage of this program to accuse them of harassment for out-of-context statements.\n\n\u201cSome people feel threatened by movements that promote diversity and inclusion. They think it means people are going to come for their jobs,\u201d said Liz Fong-Jones, a Google engineer who is a vocal supporter of diversity.\n\nMany big tech companies are struggling with the challenge of creating a more diverse work force. In 2015, Facebook adopted the so-called Rooney Rule. Originally used by the National Football League to prod teams to consider coaching prospects who are black, the rule requires managers to interview candidates from underrepresented backgrounds for open positions. But last year, Facebook\u2019s female engineers said that gender bias was still a problem and that their work received more scrutiny than men\u2019s work.\n\nEven executives tasked with promoting diversity have had difficulties. In October, Denise Young Smith, who was Apple\u2019s vice president of inclusion and diversity, came under fire when she said that there was diversity even among 12 white, blue-eyed, blond men because they had different backgrounds and experiences. She later apologized, saying she did not intend to play down the importance of a non-homogenous work force. She left Apple in December.\n\nThe tension is elevated at Google, at least in part, by its workplace culture. Google has encouraged employees to express themselves and challenge one another. It provides many communication systems for people to discuss work and nonwork related issues. Even topics considered out of bounds at other workplaces \u2014 like sharp criticism of its own products \u2014 are discussed openly and celebrated.\n\nIn January, on one of Google\u2019s 90,000 \u201cgroups\u201d \u2014 internal email lists around a discussion topic \u2014 an employee urged colleagues to donate money to help pay Mr. Damore\u2019s legal fees from his lawsuit against Google to promote \u201cviewpoint diversity,\u201d according to a person who saw the posting but is not permitted to share the information publicly.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He said he had meant that being a Republican did not exempt Google employees from following the company\u2019s code of conduct.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA Google spokeswoman said in a statement that the company encouraged lively debate. But there are limits.\n\n\u201cCreating a more diverse workplace is a big challenge and a priority we\u2019ve been working to address. Some people won\u2019t agree with our approach, and they\u2019re free to express their disagreement,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Gina Scigliano. \u201cBut some conduct and discussion in the workplace crosses a line, and we don\u2019t tolerate it. We enforce strong policies, and work with affected employees, to ensure everyone can do their work free of harassment, discrimination and bullying.\u201d\n\nIn the past, discussions about diversity in Google\u2019s online chat groups would encounter skeptical but subtle comments or questions. The debate turned openly antagonistic after Mr. Damore\u2019s memo, which was titled \u201cGoogle\u2019s Ideological Echo Chamber.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe James Damore thing brought everything to a head,\u201d said Vicki Holland, a linguist who has worked at Google for seven years. \u201cIt brought everything to the surface where everyone could see it.\u201d\n\nMr. Damore said he began to question Google\u2019s diversity policies at a weekly company meeting last March. At the meeting, Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s vice president of people operations, \u201cpointed out and shamed\u201d departments in which women accounted for less than half the staff, according to Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe two female executives \u2014 who are among the company\u2019s highest-ranking women \u2014 said Google\u2019s \u201cracial and gender preferences were not up for debate,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Mr. Damore subsequently attended a \u201cDiversity and Inclusion Summit,\u201d where it reinforced his view that Google was \u201celevating political correctness over merit\u201d with its diversity measures.\n\nMr. Damore said he had written his memo afterward in response.\n\nMs. Scigliano, the Google spokeswoman, said the company looked forward to fighting Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit in court. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said in an August blog post that he had fired Mr. Damore because his memo advanced \u201charmful gender stereotypes\u201d but that \u201cmuch of the memo is fair to debate.\u201d\n\nSome employees said they were abstaining from internal debate on sensitive issues because they worried that their comments might be misconstrued or used against them. Like the broader internet, the conversations tend to be dominated by the loudest voices, they said.\n\nGoogle\u2019s diversity advocates said they would like to see more moderation on internal forums with officials stepping in to defuse tensions before conversations get out of hand. Ms. Miller, the Coworker.org co-director, said Google employees had expressed concern about how this would affect an internal culture rooted in transparency and free expression.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s on everyone\u2019s mind is: Has the culture been inextricably damaged by this environment?\u201d she said.", "keywords": ["googles", "mr", "hard", "internal", "work", "fired", "google", "diversity", "lawsuit", "damore", "diversify", "employees", "trying"], "polarity": 0.08552789802789805, "subjectivity": 0.3460065686628187},

Asked if her resignation had to do with the direction Ms. Freiman was taking the institute, or rather her management style, William A. Royall Jr., co-chairman of the I.C.A. board, said: \u201cThere were no reservations about the curatorial direction she was taking whatsoever,\u201d without addressing the rest.\n\nThe show will go on as planned, led by the I.C.A.\u2019s chief curator, Stephanie Smith. \u201cThe exhibition is functioning as a declaration of intent for the I.C.A. being an institution that\u2019s going to grapple directly with issues that matter in our world through supporting artists\u2019 diverse voices,\u201d Ms. Smith said.\n\nAlmost half the artists have been commissioned to make new work for the show.

Over the course of six months, the artist collected snippets of conversation from patrons on issues of the day.\n\nMr. Kennedy then distilled the text into hundreds of brightly colored letterpress prints that will wallpaper the entrance wall to the I.C.A. \u201cRichmond citizens will walk in and see their own voices reflected on the wall of the institution,\u201d Ms. Smith said.\n\nMr. Rucker, who is in residence at V.C.U., working with students, is interspersing historical artifacts related to the Ku Klux Klan with his refashioned Klansmen robes.

The Baptist part is inherited, like baldness or dimples: Both of my grandfathers and three of my uncles were Baptist preachers, and my parents met as graduate students at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Genes aside, the church \u2014 plastic chairs, pilling carpet and grape juice for communion \u2014 was the organizing institution of my childhood, where I met my closest friends and most of the significant adults in my life.\n\nChurch attendance has been in generational decline. I began calling around, exploring whether people in small towns were looking for community elsewhere and, with the white nationalist rallies so often in the news, whether young white people were looking for meaning in the grim sanctuaries of the alt-right.\n\nBut I kept hearing about something different. Pastors, theologians and sociologists were talking of how black worshipers were leaving white-majority churches. They were leaving quietly and not en masse, a family here, a single person there. But it was happening everywhere, a movement large enough for some to see the unraveling of decades of efforts at racial reconciliation.\n\nI would find someone on Facebook, a black worshiper who had posted about leaving her mostly white church, and then I would find someone in the same situation halfway across the country. They would both think they were going through this alone, yet the accounts would be remarkably similar, the timelines nearly identical, even some of the words and phrases the same. There had been, I discovered, some sharp reporting about this, particularly from the writer Deborah Jian Lee, but not as much as you would expect for an experience that seemed to be this broadly shared.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPeople spoke to me of being tired, let down, heartbroken. Political and cultural partitions that they had long overlooked at worship time now overshadowed every service. The realizations almost always began with the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012, and a sense that white church leaders or fellow worshipers did not want to talk about how a black teenager walking home from a 7-Eleven could end up dead. Sometimes the preacher would privately express sympathy, but also concern about how his white congregation would take it.

As Nils Gilman argues in The American Interest, that ideal reached its apogee with the election of Barack Obama.\n\nBut Obama\u2019s election also revealed the limits of that ideal.

Progress is less about understanding and liking each other and more about smashing structures that others defend.\n\nThe second thing that happened was that reason, apparently, ceased to matter. Today\u2019s young people were raised within an educational ideology that taught them that individual reason and emotion were less important than perspectivism \u2014 what perspective you bring as a white man, a black woman, a transgender Mexican, or whatever.\n\nThese students were raised with the idea that individual reason is downstream from group identity. Then along came the 2016 election to validate that point of view! If reason and deliberation are central to democracy, how on earth did Donald Trump get elected?\n\nIf you were born after 1990, it\u2019s not totally shocking that you would see public life as an inevitable war of tribe versus tribe.

The powerful few keep everyone else down. The solutions to injustice and suffering are simple and obvious: Defeat the powerful. Passion is more important than reason because the oppressed masses have to mobilize to storm the barricades. Debate is counterproductive because it dilutes passion and sows confusion. Discordant ideas are not there to inform; they are there to provide cover for oppression.\n\nSome people I admire see today\u2019s student mobbism as an outbreak of an ersatz religion, but I\u2019d say their theory of social change is at least comprehensible given the era they inhabit.\n\nIf I could talk to the students I\u2019d try to persuade them that mistake theory is a more accurate and effective way to change the world than conflict theory, but I probably wouldn\u2019t persuade them.\n\nSo I\u2019d just ask them to take two courses.

Their hope was that by sharing their stories they could start dialogues and inspire change.\n\nI could identify; I knew what it was like to sometimes feel like an outsider. And as an editor at The Times, I wondered what I could do to advance the conversation.\n\nAn answer came as I was researching an obit for a woman in the tennis world. I discovered the story of Mary Ewing Outerbridge when I stumbled upon a website crediting her with introducing tennis to America. I wondered if she had received a Times obituary when she died in 1886. I checked our digital newspaper archives. She had not.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter that, anytime I came across an interesting person who died years ago, I searched our archives for an obit. Those who didn\u2019t get one were, not surprisingly, largely women and people of color. I started talking about my research with colleagues, friends and relatives, all of whom began sending me more names.\n\nI soon had a list of dozens of fascinating people, such as Ms. Larsen; Madhubala, a Bollywood actress whose poetically tragic life was cut short; and Margaret Abbott, a golfer who died without ever knowing that she was the first American woman to win an Olympic championship.\n\nEven more surprising were some blatant omissions of those who had achieved a measure of fame in their lifetime, like the poet Sylvia Plath, the writer Charlotte Bront\u00eb and the photographer Diane Arbus.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t they get obits? I can only speculate. Perhaps the mark they made on the world wasn\u2019t recognized until decades after their deaths. Or maybe some of them faded into obscurity, their achievements forgotten. It could be that The Times didn\u2019t learn about their deaths until it was too late. Or that the omission was more purposeful, a judgment call of an editor who didn\u2019t deem the death newsworthy.\n\nRegardless, I now had an opportunity to give these women their due.\n\nIn November 2017, I met Jessica Bennett, The Times\u2019s first gender editor. She agreed that Overlooked was a compelling way to add to the record, and we decided to partner up.\n\nWhat followed was a whirlwind of excitement in the newsroom, with writers, editors, international correspondents, page designers, photo editors \u2014 whether they were women, men, people of color or not \u2014 asking us how they could contribute. Dozens of people have played a meaningful role in making it come together.\n\nBecause many of the subjects we wrote about died long ago, we decided to diverge from the traditional obituary style of announcing a person\u2019s death at the start of the article. Instead, we encouraged writers to be creative with their storytelling.\n\nThis series is just the beginning. I\u2019m hopeful it will inspire many more conversations inside the newsroom and beyond about diversity and what we can do to make sure no one is overlooked.\n\nIf you would like to suggest someone who has been overlooked, please fill out this form.", "keywords": ["obits", "writers", "died", "world", "born", "woman", "project", "didnt", "wondered", "editor", "tennis", "times", "overlooked", "women"], "polarity": 0.18925070028011204, "subjectivity": 0.46301353874883283},

We also do our own homework: We investigate, research and ask around before settling on our subjects.\n\nSome might think our process presumptuous. Who, after all, anointed a handful of Times editors to stand by the roadside as a parade of humanity passes and single out this one, this one \u2014 but not that one \u2014 as worthy of being remembered?\n\nThe answer is that no one did, actually, because that is not precisely what we decide. We make no judgments, moral or otherwise, about human worth. What we do try to judge, however, is newsworthiness, and that\u2019s a whole other standard.\n\nPhoto\n\nThere is no formula, scoring system or checklist. But we do hold to certain criteria, slippery as they may be. Fame, of the widespread kind, will usually get someone past the velvet ropes. Accomplishment, with wide impact, matters as much, and it often goes hand in hand with fame.\n\nBut achievement may also speak softly. Eugene Goldwasser, to name one subject among 1,195 Times obits in 2010, was a largely unsung biochemist whose 20-year pursuit of an elusive protein led to the development of a widely used anemia drug that became one of the biggest products of the biotechnology industry.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWangari Maathai was a Kenyan environmentalist who began a movement to reforest her country by paying poor women a few shillings to plant trees. She might have died in 2011 largely unknown to the wider world had she not become the first African woman to win a Nobel Peace Prize seven years before.\n\nSometimes we choose a subject in part to represent a group whose contributions were forgotten or ignored. Violet Cowden, who also died in 2011, comes to mind: She helped ferry supplies for American troops in World War II as a member of the stateside Women Airforce Service Pilots.\n\nFor every person we decide to write about there are innumerable others we decide against. Fame and accomplishment are relative; the public eye is easily distracted, and only a moment or two in its fickle gaze may not be enough to merit a backward look in The Times.\n\nThe same might be said of a sparkling r\u00e9sum\u00e9. The best schools, a successful corporate climb, charitable good works and distinguished service awards are impressive and laudable, but not necessarily newsworthy to a global audience.\n\nOne thing to remember is that it is not our intent to honor the dead; we leave the tributes to the eulogists. We seek only to report deaths and to sum up lives, illuminating why, in our judgment, those lives were significant. The justification for the obituary is in the story it tells.\n\nMany readers legitimately ask: Why are the vast majority of our obituary subjects white men? The answer lies in our not-so-distant history.\n\nUnlike the rest of the newsroom, the obituaries desk covers the past, not the present. Our pages mirror the world of 1975 or 1965 or 1955, or even earlier: They\u2019re a rearview mirror, reflecting the world as it was, not as it is, and not as we might wish it to have been.\n\nAnd so we are, inevitably, a generation or three behind in tracking the evolution of gender and racial dynamics, among other things. The prominent shapers of society back then, those who held (and didn\u2019t easily give up) the levers of power, were disproportionately white and male, be they former United States senators or business titans or Hollywood directors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith Overlooked, our new collection of obituaries for women and others who never got them, The Times is acknowledging that many worthy subjects were skipped for generations, for whatever reasons.\n\nConscious or unconscious bias? Could be. Perhaps my predecessors and I were never informed of the deaths. Maybe those who knew the deceased did not think we\u2019d be interested. Maybe an editor passed for lack of interest, or maybe considered an obit but did not have a reporter available to write it. (A practical reality that bedevils us today.)\n\nPerhaps the significance of an individual portrayed in Overlooked was not fully recognized until decades after her death. Or perhaps the paper\u2019s selection standards in eras past unfairly valued the achievements of the white, male mainstream over those of minorities and women who may have been more on the margins.\n\nI\u2019d like to think that those portrayed in Overlooked would be prime candidates for an obit in The Times today \u2014 precisely because they fit a broader standard of significance and impact and, by the way, offer compelling stories.\n\nSo why not more women and people of color on the obituary pages? (Why, for that matter, not more openly gay people, or transgender people?)\n\nThe larger answer: Because relatively few of them were allowed to make such a mark on society in their own time. Universities may have barred them. Businesses and political parties may have shut them out. The tables of power were crowded with white men; there were few seats for anyone else.\n\nThere were, of course, women who crashed glass ceilings, blacks and Native Americans and people of Asian heritage who pushed through \u201cwhites only\u201d barriers. And their stories have been told in the obituary pages over many decades.\n\nNo doubt, we\u2019ll see more of them in the years to come. As time goes on, I imagine that their stories will be increasingly framed not by broken barriers but simply by what they built, unencumbered by the dead weights of discrimination.", "keywords": ["maybe", "world", "death", "pages", "past", "white", "obituaries", "think", "women", "desk", "times", "overlooked", "obituary", "men"], "polarity": 0.10482996385058244, "subjectivity": 0.431367429821038},

Sarah Laskow of The Atlantic explained in 2014 that philosophers at this time were, in the words of the sociologist Karl Mannheim, \u201canxious to find a general law to express the rhythm of historical development, based on the biological law of the limited lifetimes of man.\u201d /But understanding societal phenomena through the lens of groups of people born around the same time has always had its limits.\n\nFor example, it\u2019s true that for young men coming-of-age during the Vietnam War, being born in a particular year (and, thanks to the draft lottery, on a particular day) could be life-shaping. But even here, an individual\u2019s class was a factor in whether he actually went to war \u2014 men from privileged backgrounds had many options to avoid the draft, the burden of which fell mainly on the working class.\n\nLike war service, entering the labor market at a time of recession, as most millennials did, can be difficult. But race and class are more important in affecting how this experience plays out for individuals.\n\nTake white millennial college graduates: Yes, they\u2019re part of an age cohort that has experienced worse economic conditions than graduates of the preceding generation \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t give us a particularly meaningful understanding of their plight, given that they are still better off when it comes to income than the average non-college-educated worker of any age.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome may argue that the generation game, if intellectually vacuous, is basically harmless. But dividing society by generation obscures the real and enduring lines of race, class and gender. When, for example, baby boomers are blamed for \u201cruining America,\u201d the argument lumps together Donald Trump and a 60-year-old black woman who works for minimum wage cleaning one of his hotels.\n\nThe pattern of inherited privilege points to yet another reality that the generation game ignores: the decline of social mobility between generations and the rise of what the French economist Thomas Piketty has called a \u201cpatrimonial society.\u201d When it comes to wealth and its accompanying privileges, the wealth of the previous generation of one\u2019s own family matter more than whether your birth year falls on one or other side of some arbitrary boundary.\n\nToday\u2019s young people may choose political action aimed at reversing these trends or to let them continue and accelerate.

Many Germans and Swedes now recognize \u2014 and some celebrate \u2014 the fact that their fellow citizens can have any skin color or religion. But the attempt to turn countries with monoethnic identities into truly multiethnic nations is a historically unique experiment, and so it should hardly come as a surprise that it has encountered some fierce resistance.\n\nThe situation in Canada and the United States, despite their histories as countries of immigration, has important similarities to that in Europe. Both have historically had rigid racial hierarchies. And in recent decades, both have made real steps toward overcoming these injustices: African-Americans, for example, are better represented in business and government than at any previous point in American history. This has made opposition to a more equal, multiethnic society more fervid among those who feel their privileges threatened. There is a sizable number of Americans for whom the idea of the nation remains synonymous with whiteness and Christianity.\n\nSo long as nationalism is associated with one particular ethnic or religious group, it will serve to exclude and disadvantage others. The only way to keep the destructive potential of nationalism in check is to fight for a society in which collective identity transcends ethnic and religious boundaries \u2014 one in which citizens from all religious or ethnic backgrounds are treated with the same respect as citizens from the majority group.\n\nTo effect this transformation is one of the great political challenges of our age. It requires principled resistance to right-wing nationalism, but it can succeed only if those who are most open to diversity abandon their hostility to other forms of nationalism.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nOne common reaction to the dangerous excesses of nationalism has been to forgo the need for any form of collective identity, exhorting people to transcend tribal allegiances completely. But for better or probably worse, it\u2019s easier to be moved by the suffering of people with whom we have some form of kinship. That is why nationalism remains one of the most powerful vehicles for expanding our circle of sympathy.\n\nAnother common reaction to the resurgence of nationalism has been to celebrate more narrow forms of collective identity, such as race or religion. At a time when many minority groups are under attack, it is, of course, crucial to defend them against discrimination. But it is also important to remember that such groups, too, are capable of oppressing their own members, for example by enforcing restrictive moral codes. That\u2019s why the only way to allow individuals true freedom to lead their lives is to preserve some form of political identity independent of the interests of particular cultural groups.\n\nConvinced that they would be unable to redirect nationalism toward their own ends, many of the most open-minded segments of society long ago gave up on the fight to determine its meaning. In countries like Germany and the United States, advocacy for the victims of prejudice has increasingly bled into a belief that the dark chapters of those countries\u2019 history make any form of nationalism deeply suspect. Instead of exhorting their fellow citizens to live up to their nations\u2019 highest ideals, many activists seem content with denouncing past and present injustices. This has allowed the bigots and racists to bend the meaning of the nation to their own sinister ends.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s time to fight back. Nationalism can, and should, be reclaimed for liberals.\n\nA few political leaders have made a valiant start. Barack Obama has been an especially persuasive advocate of the idea that Americans should focus on what unites rather than what divides us and that the symbolism of the nation can inspire hope, even as we reckon with the injustices of American history. \u201cWhat greater expression of faith in the American experiment than this,\u201d Mr. Obama marveled as he stood on the spot in Selma, Ala. where civil rights protesters were beaten in 1965. \u201cWhat greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished, that we are strong enough to be self-critical, that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is in our power to remake this nation to more closely align with our highest ideals?\u201d\n\nCampaigning for France\u2019s presidency last year, Emmanuel Macron expressed inclusive patriotism in an even more explicit form. \u201cI see Armenians, Italians, Algerians, Moroccans, Tunisians,\u201d he said at a rally in Marseille, a diverse city in southern France, \u201cBut what do I see? I see the people of Marseille! What do I see? I see the people of France!\u201d This, he added in an explicit repudiation of the exclusive nationalism propagated by the far-right National Front party, \u201cis what it means to be proud to be French!\u201d\n\nAmerican \u2014 and to a lesser degree European \u2014 political culture is pregnant with the symbols of inclusive patriotism. But while we have plenty of history to build on, we must also recognize that we are fighting to establish a kind of society for which there is no clear precedent.\n\nIn the United States, the model had once been a melting pot. But asking individuals to conform to one unified culture puts the price of admission to the nation too high. In Canada, the model is often said to be that of a salad bowl, in which the overall dish is enriched by the great variety of individual ingredients. But we can now see that this may be an overly idealized image of a society in which people feel that they have little in common across ethnic and religious divides.\n\nThere may not be a perfect culinary metaphor for the kind of country inclusive nationalists seek to create. But its contours should be obvious. It is a state in which all members have the same rights and opportunities irrespective of the group into which they are born or the culture to which they belong. It is a society in which people feel that they have something important in common because they seek to govern themselves together, pledge to help one another in an hour of need and recognize that these shared commitments are ultimately more consequential than any difference of color or creed. And it is a culture that does not shy away from celebrating the nobility of this collective identity \u2014 embracing the nation\u2019s flag not because we claim never to have failed our compatriots in the past but because we aspire to realize a common future fair to all.\n\nIt would be tempting to say that this kind of patriotism has little in common with the nationalism that is now ascendant around the world. Patriotism, some philosophers argue, should be understood as an innocent love of country that is inclusive at home and cooperative abroad. Nationalism, by contrast, excludes other ethnicities and stands in competition with the interests of other countries.\n\nBut it is too clever by half to pretend that we can safely stoke the good aspects of patriotism without ever running the danger of exacerbating the worst aspects of nationalism. For the kind of patriotism I am proposing is not a completely different form of collective identity; it is, rather, one that proudly stands in competition with the exclusionary politics on display from Washington to Moscow to Beijing.\n\nNationalism is like a half-wild beast. As long as it remains under our control, it can be of tremendous use. But if we abandon it, others are sure to step in, prodding and baiting the beast to bring out its most ferocious side. For all the well-founded misgivings about it, we have little choice but to domesticate it as best we can.", "keywords": ["identity", "common", "liberals", "religious", "society", "form", "reclaim", "nationalism", "patriotism", "nation", "collective", "political"], "polarity": 0.14129125602529854, "subjectivity": 0.47932204517310895},

But when the rebellious Belle Camellia uncovers a plot by the truly vile Princess Sophia to enslave her and her sisters, she sows the seeds of a grass-roots revolution that is bound to blossom more fully in the inevitable sequel.\n\nPhoto\n\nClayton, a co-founder of the We Need Diverse Books organization, has created an opulent mash-up setting, which seems to be a cherry-picked combination of 18th-century France, Japan and the antebellum American South. If it never quite coalesces into a seamless cultural whole, readers seduced by the page-turning palace intrigue and the vivid food and clothing descriptions won\u2019t notice or care.\n\nMagic also lies dormant in the platelets of chosen teenagers in the Nigerian-American Tomi Adeyemi\u2019s debut, CHILDREN OF BLOOD AND BONE (Holt, $18.99; ages 12 and up). But these diviners are no debutantes. Born with snow white hair and deep brown skin in the imaginary country of Or\u00efsha, young diviners morph into mighty, magic-wielding maji, or magicians, at 13. For centuries they relied on their powers (which Adeyemi based on aspects of the religion of the Yoruban people of West Africa). All that ended when the nonmagical King Saran ordered the slaughter of all adult majis. But when a mysterious scroll falls into the hands of Amari, a defiant princess, and Z\u00e9lie, a tenacious diviner warrior, the two young women set out on a thrilling, death-defying journey to restore magic and take back the throne.\n\nPhoto\n\nBlack Girl Magic, indeed! It\u2019s no surprise that this epic trilogy opener has already been optioned for film. Full of cinematic action sequences (the most memorable of them set almost entirely underwater and employing an army of the dead) and creatures worthy of Star Wars (horse-size \u201clionaires\u201d have saber teeth and horns), it storms the boundaries of the imagination. Yet it also confronts the conscience. Adeyemi\u2019s brutally depicted war between the noble, lighter-skinned kosidans and the enslaved, darker-skinned majis poses thought-provoking questions about race, class and authority that hold up a warning mirror to our sharply divided society.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Tareq is a Syrian refugee whose perilous journey is narrated by the voice of Destiny, characterized as a kindly, prosaic entity. After Tareq\u2019s mother, grandmother and four of his siblings are killed by a bomb, he and his father flee to Turkey with his remaining sister, Susan. They hopscotch from Turkey to Greece, Serbia, Slovenia, Austria and finally to Germany, where he finds a fragile safety. Along the way he witnesses beheadings and drownings, but also experiences the kindness of aid workers like Alexia, an American student. Abawi, a foreign news correspondent, does an admirable job of showing the grim horror of refugee life. But her efforts are occasionally undermined by cartoonish villains (\u201cYou tink you will be saved? Who will save you? Captain America is not real, just movies\u201d) and by some of Destiny\u2019s well-meaning but obvious platitudes: \u201cWhen you truly love someone, their life means more to you than your own.\u201d These interruptions may pull readers out of the story, though perhaps that distance is necessary for adolescents trying to process something as bleak and overwhelming as the Syrian refugee crisis.\n\nPhoto\n\nOf course, once refugees finally arrive in their adopted country, new problems arise. Until she was 13, Sara Saedi, an Iranian-American television writer and the author of the memoir AMERICANIZED: Rebel Without a Green Card (Random House, $17.99, ages 12 and up), was cheerfully oblivious of her family\u2019s immigration status. After her older sister breaks the news that they are \u201cillegal,\u201d Saedi suffers through the usual teenage rites of passage at her Silicon Valley high school (unibrow management, pimple wars, pot smoking) with the added pressure of possible deportation hanging over her head. Saedi adroitly and humorously uses these universal pubescent ordeals to contextualize Iranian culture and the immigrant experience. A memory of being teased about her eyebrow in ninth grade expands into a discussion of beauty norms: When her mother praises her for being hairless, \u201cshe meant by Persian woman standards. I was still hairy by everyone else\u2019s standards.\u201d And she has the sobering realization that pot is a privilege American teenagers can enjoy, but not undocumented kids: \u201cIf I got caught, I\u2019d have a criminal record that could be grounds for deportation.\u201d Very funny but never flippant, Saedi mixes \u201990s pop culture references, adolescent angst and Iranian history into an intimate, informative narrative that thoroughly defies current divisive views on immigration.\n\nPhoto\n\nMary H.K. Choi\u2019s blushingly tender and piquant debut novel, EMERGENCY CONTACT (Simon & Schuster, $17.99; ages 14 and up), about two isolated, misfit college students from Austin who fall in love via text message explores our emotional rather than geographical divides. In \u201cEmergency Contact,\u201d a Korean-American would-be writer named Penny keeps everyone at a distance, the result of living with a single, oversharing mom she calls \u201cthe equivalent of \u2026 human glitter.\u201d But when she rescues Sam, a half-German, half-Polish student filmmaker, from the sidewalk during a panic attack, she becomes his \u201cemergency contact,\u201d and he hers. Their charged, initial banter on text soon develops into increasingly personal exchanges about art, death, unstable moms and pregnant ex-girlfriends. Yet their burgeoning bond keeps stalling out. Burned by past relationships and millennial-ly tethered to their devices, they struggle to connect romantically IRL. Sam \u201ccouldn\u2019t imagine the space Penny would take up in his life if she sprang out of his phone,\u201d and Penny admits \u201cSam was her phone and her phone was Sam.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nChoi, a culture correspondent for HBO\u2019s Vice News, inserts timely issues like sexual assault, cultural appropriation and even DACA into her characters\u2019 intimate conversations, but it is her examination of digital vs. F2F communication that feels the most immediate.

She takes comfort from local efforts like a project in Utica, N.Y., where Bosnian Muslim immigrants and local Unitarian Christians watched a Super Bowl together. She applauds aggressive racial integration programs like those run by the American military. She cites her own teaching experience in small seminars at Yale, where students from divergent backgrounds overcame disagreements to achieve mutual respect, sometimes even friendship.\n\nPhoto\n\nYet the scholar in Chua acknowledges that these individual experiences offer less of a social lesson than she would wish.\n\n\u201cStudies show that minimal or superficial exposure to out-group members can actually worsen group division. \u2026 Negative interactions with people from other groups also increase group hostility. So merely putting members of different groups in the same space is not enough and indeed can aggravate political tribalism.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Chua falls back on the very attitude to which she turned her sharply skeptical gaze at the beginning of the book: the conviction that the United States was, is and will remain an exceptional nation, different from all the others. In her introduction, Chua remarked that the United States as a supertribal entity indifferent to ethnicity and culture became at best a partial reality only a generation ago. By book\u2019s end, however, the battered ideal has been polished and refurbished.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Will we, telling ourselves \u2018These immigrants are different,\u2019 be the weak link, the first generation to fail? Will we forget who we are?\u201d That\u2019s inspiring, and even more so are the citations of Martin Luther King Jr., Lin-Manuel Miranda and Langston Hughes that finish the book.\n\nInspiring \u2014 but not wholly reassuring. A lot of the interest of \u201cPolitical Tribes\u201d comes from the strong sense it emanates of an author arguing with herself. Chua both condemns tribalism and respects its power. She insists that the United States alone of nations among the earth has often transcended it \u2014 and then presents impressive contrary evidence from the past and the present. Chua reckons with the many tribalisms of the American past: ethnic, religious and racial. She hopes for a future in which tribalism fades \u2014 even as she mercilessly details its accumulating strength.\n\nAs Chua notes, tribes can coalesce out of previously unrelated pieces. Immigrants to Europe from North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia \u2014 of different languages, ethnicities, folkways and religious practices \u2014 raised children who created for themselves a new identity as post-ethnic Muslims. ISIS, as Chua mordantly observes, is in its own way a melting pot, bringing together young men and women from across Europe, Asia and the Americas to fight for a new ideology. She quotes a New York Times article about young British girls lured to ISIS. For them, \u201cIslam is punk rock.\u201d\n\nTribes can be created by fission as well as by fusion. Chua suggests that in the United States, divisions that would once have been understood as class divides have been reinterpreted in our time as cultural, even when they are not ethnic. \u201cWhite Americans often hold their biggest disdain for other white Americans \u2014 the ones on the opposite side of the cultural divide.\u201d\n\nThese fast-evolving and ever-changing identities may look contingent from the outside. They feel overwhelmingly powerful to those inside. Chua repeatedly scolds American policymakers for underestimating the importance of ethnocultural identity in Vietnam in the 1960s, Venezuela in the 1990s and Afghanistan in the 2000s. Through her book pulses an evident worry that tribal claims are now overpowering national ones within the United States. If she cannot quite bring herself to make her own anxieties explicit \u2014 or figure out what if anything to do to address them \u2014 she is hardly alone.

Fred Harris is the second person to the right of Kerner. Underwood Archives/Getty Images\n\n\u201cOur nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white \u2013 separate and unequal.\u201d\n\nFifty years ago, on March 1, 1968, these were the grim words of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, called the Kerner Commission after its chairman, Gov. Otto Kerner of Illinois.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson had established the commission to examine the disorders and violent protests in Detroit, Newark and well over 100 other American cities during the summer of 1967, and earlier. What it found was searing. \u201cWhat white Americans have never fully understood \u2013 but what the Negro can never forget \u2013 is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto,\u201d the commission concluded. \u201cWhite institutions created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it.\u201d\n\nMostly moderate and mostly white men, the members of the bipartisan panel carried the imprimatur of the political establishment. Their recommendations attracted widespread public debate. The paperback edition of the report sold over two million copies.\n\nOccupied by the Vietnam War and concerned about the legacy of his Great Society domestic agenda, Johnson distanced himself from the \u201ctwo societies\u201d warning. But the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Robert Kennedy strongly endorsed the commission\u2019s findings and recommendations before they were assassinated and before more protests erupted during that traumatic year of 1968.\n\nThe Kerner Commission recommended \u201cmassive and sustained\u201d investments in jobs and education to reduce poverty, inequality and racial injustice.

The overall poverty rate remains about the same today as it was 50 years ago; the total number of poor people has increased from over 25 million to well over 40 million, more than the population of California.\n\nMeanwhile, the rich have profited at the expense of most working Americans. Today, the top 1 percent receive 52 percent of all new income. Rich people are healthier and live longer. They get a better education, which produces greater gains in income. And their greater economic power translates into greater political power.\n\nFive Indicators America of the 1960s contrasted with the most recent available data.

I\u2019d love to jump right in and hear your aspirations for Prairie View. What do you hope to accomplish in your time as president? I assume you had many offers to lead other colleges. Why was Prairie View different?\n\nRuth Simmons: Well, I\u2019m a native of Texas, and one of the things that I did when I returned to Houston after I retired from Brown was think about the ways I could use my experience to help the community. I started with small ventures in the city, but I hadn\u2019t thought really that another university would be in my life. But when I was approached by Prairie View, I thought immediately about its significant impact on my brother, who went there. And what Dillard did for me.\n\nI grew up in a segregated neighborhood in Grapeland, Tex., with very little experience with the world. The transition that Dillard enabled for me was extremely valuable. As an undergraduate, I began to grow a sense of confidence that helped me move from a fairly insular environment to a bigger stage when I went to graduate school.\n\nMy aspirations for Prairie View are to essentially make sure the university is continuing to do the same thing for students today that it did for my brother \u2014 and Dillard did for me. And that is to offer the advantage of a strong education that will prepare students for the careers they want, in a social and cultural context that helps them develop the confidence to perform after graduation.\n\nAs president, that means focusing on time-honored strategies to success that apply to universities everywhere: worrying about the faculty who are recruited here, the campus experience, and whether we are providing the leadership and internship opportunities that students need. It means worrying about the reputation of the university. It\u2019s obviously a much more competitive world today than it was when I was a student, but the underlying work to move the university to a level of achievement that makes students and alumni proud is the same.\n\nM.J.: What do you see as some of the major challenges facing historically black colleges and universities?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: The general challenge for H.B.C.U.s is not unlike the problem many universities face today, and that is the financial model. Being tuition dependent has become a large problem for all universities. H.B.C.U.s are dependent on raising money, but that is a reality that most universities obviously face. So it very much depends on the question of whether the schools have a good-enough foundation because of secure financing. When it comes to the federal government\u2019s role in supporting H.B.C.U.s, I think we don\u2019t yet understand the extent to which they will be affected by the changes in Washington today. To say that many are not hopeful in this moment is an understatement. We just don\u2019t know.\n\nFrankly, that\u2019s why I advocate for developing enough financial independence to secure the future of our institutions. That means looking for different revenue streams, looking to increase our ability to raise funds and finding alternate programs that help to bring more income into our university. The only strategy cannot be to persistently raise tuition, making college outside the reach of many families.\n\nM.J.: You\u2019ve led several institutions that are all very different from each other, and the topic of leadership is something you\u2019ve talked a lot about. In another interview with The Times you said that it\u2019s much easier to lead people \u201cif you convey the underlying principles.\u201d Can you elaborate?\n\nR.S.: One thing that I\u2019ve learned is that the perceptions of what it takes to be a leader are often based on prototypical models that don\u2019t have much truth in reality. People look at the institutions that I have led and they see dissimilarities. I see similarities. When people think in terms of leadership, they\u2019re often thinking about the kind of specific skills needed for different types of enterprises. I think of leadership as more of a disposition \u2014 the ability to step into a situation to learn about the history of the enterprise, the opportunities that it faces, the culture that exists and the people who are served by it. To look at all of that, to listen to stakeholders and then to think about how that enterprise or institution should best be served. There is no one model of leadership if you approach it that way. What I have tried to do wherever I go is to start where the institution is rather than try to import particularly rigid constructs from other places. In that sense, I think a leader is more than anything else a facilitator. A person who is able to come in to show a community a picture of what it is, to provide some insight into what it could be \u2014 how it could be different or improved perhaps \u2014 and then enlist the help of people who are there and others who support that institution in order to move forward together.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nI don\u2019t subscribe to the model of hero leadership, which is identifying somebody who can come in and have magical powers and then wield the wand and fix things that have not been fixable before. I don\u2019t see that. I think leadership is a community affair.\n\nM.J.: That makes sense. So how do you approach educating the current generation of students at Prairie View to lead in the way you described?\n\nR.S.: People today are fond of leadership programs that theorize about the profile and tenets of leadership. And students anxiously get involved in those programs. I rather think that our entire campuses are incubators of leadership even without the formality of such programs because if we\u2019re doing what we should be doing, we are acclimating students to an environment in which they have to learn to work with others who are very different from themselves. And that seems to me to be the first requirement of leadership. To actually learn to work with people in a respectful and inclusive way is inordinately important. A campus provides one of the best opportunities for people to be able to do that because you sit in class alongside people whom you initially don\u2019t know. You are discussing your ideas, having people respond to them and often rejecting what you\u2019re saying. You are joining organizations that have certain aims that are being advanced by the collective, so you\u2019re learning how to facilitate. You are asked to step into leadership roles either through student government or organizations. Even in the classroom context you might play a leadership role. You have to learn to express yourself, to be convincing, to write out your ideas, to be more thoughtful than you\u2019d ordinarily be. All of those things are components of leadership.\n\nM.J.: Some would argue that social media, or perhaps disagreements over the concept of safe spaces, have made it more challenging for people to come together and to work together.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: Yeah, I would say that people frequently say that, but that has certainly not been my experience. I would say that in my days as a student, the tensions were higher, the disagreements were greater, the separation among us was certainly more pronounced. And people are kind of inventing a new narrative, that things are so much worse today than they were in the past. I don\u2019t buy that. I think we have new terminology, because the modern sciences of psychology and sociology and so forth and modern media have enabled us to peer into areas that we were not able to see as easily as before. And so when you have social media and all of the ways in which people can now say whatever they want to say \u2014 in an unartful or offensive way \u2014 that turns the volume up to be sure. But it doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t there before.\n\nI would say that the current situation ought to give us much more practice in how to engage with each other because it is not underground. It\u2019s out front, it\u2019s in the open. The media today and the things that are being reported should be upsetting or troubling to students, my goodness. But it may be an even better opportunity to engage students.\n\nAs a teacher, as an educator, I would say these times are especially fertile for teaching the skills that are needed in a world in which there are many types of people, many perspectives and so forth. Students don\u2019t need to feel silenced by the current situation. When students at Brown came to me and said, you know, they were hurt because somebody asked them about their hair, and they were tired of that and they didn\u2019t want any part of it, I would say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s just too bad!\u201d Somebody asked you about your hair, tell them about your hair. You are in college not to hide from that. You\u2019re there to teach the world about yourself, you\u2019re there to learn about others and to teach them about who you are. So I\u2019d rather think this whole notion of protecting people from that is something that we have to take in hand and deal with. And help students see the opportunity in that because if they engage with people who have those kinds of perspectives, they are going to be much stronger in the end than if they run away.\n\nM.J.: Do you see the situation differently for students at H.B.C.U.s? You mentioned that Dillard gave you the space to learn and build confidence before heading to graduate school.\n\nR.S.: There is a narrative that many people have for H.B.C.U.s. People see them as a monolith, or only see them as filling a gap that exists for African-Americans. H.B.C.U.s are not a brand. They are institutions with a certain history \u2014 they were originally set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for education \u2014 but they are not all alike, and are very diverse in what they offer.\n\nPrairie View, for example, is the second-oldest public institution of higher education in the state of Texas. It was set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for ex-slaves and whites. For a long time it provided educational opportunities for black students that wouldn\u2019t have been open to them otherwise. In nursing, architecture, engineering and other STEM fields at a time when many blacks were not able to go into those areas, the university was able to facilitate the entry of blacks into those professions.\n\nM.J.: Yes, this is something that Nikole Hannah-Jones has written about for The New York Times Magazine, in particular how Xavier University of Louisiana sends more black students to medical school than almost any other college in the country. I read that Prairie View has many more students who graduate with degrees in architecture and engineering.\n\nR.S.: Yes, going to Dillard is not like going to Prairie View. So the student who chooses to go to one H.B.C.U. may not find another appealing. That has to do with the unique features of the place, the academic culture and so on, the traditions. All of that makes a big difference.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen I went off to college, I was just trying to find a place where I could be a student without impediments that in that day and time were fairly widely known to be substantial if you enrolled in a majority-white institution. There was no question that in 1963, if you went off to college in the South, you had to be very careful about where you studied. The racial dynamic was very challenging at that time. One of the things I\u2019m learning now is that many of the students I speak to at Prairie View today have the same kinds of thoughts that I had those many years ago. They ask themselves, where can I feel comfortable so that I don\u2019t have to worry about anything but my academic work? So certainly that plays a factor in why students apply to H.B.C.U.s. And for some H.B.C.U.s, applications are way up. But if you reach the point where you think that a category of institutions are the right choice for you \u2014 going to an H.B.C.U. just to go to an H.B.C.U. \u2014 then you\u2019re not thinking broadly enough.\n\nM.J.: As you look across the landscape of higher education, what other challenges do college students face today?\n\nR.S.: I guess I worry a lot about our students having the skills and the experience to promote respectful interactions with a wide-ranging group of people. Students can be quite passionate about what they see on the national scene and how sometimes dangerous they think it is \u2014 how unpleasant it is and so forth. But we\u2019ve got to try to find a way on our campuses not to taint the national picture as hopeless, or as being antithetical to anything that we can think of as good and admirable. The last thing we want is for our students to bow out and decide that it isn\u2019t worth trying to do anything about a hopeless situation.\n\nAnd I do think that civility goes hand in hand with being hopeful. Hopeful that the next person you meet you will be able to converse with you in a respectful way. Hopeful that the next election cycle is going to give you a chance to be engaged and able to do something that makes you feel a sense of your own agency. Hopeful that the things will get better rather than worse.\n\nSo much of what we have to do on our campuses is really to hold open the possibility for people that civil society will in the end right itself \u2014 if enough of us are engaged. I am so thankful every day for the fact that I grew up in a time when nobody thought blacks would be able to be integrated into American society, they would never be able to hold important positions, they\u2019d never be respected intellectually, they\u2019d never be able to do the things that they are now able to do. So why did we persist? And why did we continue to work toward betterment? We did it because we had people working with us in education who were ever hopeful that things were going to change. So I like to say to educators, you have to be always projecting to students that civility enables hopefulness to be ever resurgent.", "keywords": ["leadership", "say", "dont", "cultivating", "able", "students", "simmons", "prairie", "today", "view", "think", "college", "ruth", "generation", "things"], "polarity": 0.18839701321015756, "subjectivity": 0.47766767453623127},

They are quiet, almost too much so. But once you learn what happened in these scenes from small towns, big cities or verdant fields, their almost unemotional first impression gives way to horror: Someone was lynched there.\n\nStarting in 2016, Mr. Clasper traveled through the United States seeking the sites of lynchings. He wanted to show how places that call no attention to themselves were the sites of hangings, slashings or execution by gunfire. In the course of covering 24 sites, they span 150 years, right up to the present century, and range from the American south to New York City.\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective, I take it back to 1903, when the American scholar and activist W.E.B. Du Bois said the problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line,\u201d Mr. Clasper said. \u201cIt seems to me not a lot has changed despite significant advances. There has been barely a year or generation that has passed where racism and violence have not been at the forefront of the American experience.\u201d\n\nAs the London-born son of a British mother and American father, Mr. Clasper said he had \u201ca deep spiritual connection to the American landscape.\u201d In this series \u2014 titled \u201cThe Spaces We Inherit\u201d \u2014 he hopes to gently confront viewers in a way that eschews graphic images of violence.\n\n\u201cI took a different approach and focused on the spaces to encourage people to look at this history from an altered perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve become desensitized to images of violence. But everything that happen s has to happen somewhere.\u201d\n\nGiven the persisting tensions over racial and religious prejudice, Mr. Clasper wants to gently provoke a necessary conversation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to investigate these deep-seated issues in America,\u201d he said. \u201cI think many agree that the nation has not dealt with its bloody past of lynchings and segregation. It seemed to me there has been no collective acceptance, let alone recognition of the mistakes made and the sins committed.\u201d\n\nInterviews were conducted by Oliver Clasper and have been edited for brevity.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Jesse Lee Bond, Arlington, Tenn., 1939\n\nOn April 28, 1939, a local sharecropper named Jesse Lee Bond was shot to death in broad daylight by employees of SY Wilson, a local hardware store. Jesse Lee Bond had asked for an invoice the day before after purchasing goods on credit, something that was no\u0095t done by African-Americans at that time as keeping sharecroppers in the dark about how much they had spent was one way for white owners to keep their workers in constant debt. The day of Jesse Lee Bond\u2019s murder he was ordered back to the store. His aunt accompanied him and witnessed the whole thing. \u201cThey shot at him and shot him. He ran out to the outhouse. They riddled the outhouse. And when he staggered out of the outhouse, they threw him down, castrated him, and dragged him to the river,\u0095\u201d she said. The family was told he had drowned accidentally.\n\nImage\n\nSylvester Lewis, Memphis\n\n\u201cI remember my cousin Jesse well. I was 9 when he was killed and he was 20. What I heard was that there had been a dispute at the SY Wilson general store over in Arlington. Jesse insisted on a receipt, but this is something they didn\u2019\u0095t do. I think whoever he was negotiating with relented, but I think the people over him, the father of the individual in question, didn\u2019\u0095t like it. They went to his home and said they wanted to talk to him and ordered him back to the store. When he returned they attacked him. He tried to run for his life but they caught up with him and shot him. I also heard that they dragged his body behind a vehicle and then dumped him in the river. The descendants are running the store now, and I\u2019\u0095m not sure they know what happened. The ones who were allegedly involved in the lynching passed a long time ago, but their relations are still in Arlington. I don\u2019t think there\u2019\u0095s any resentment now. Anyone who hears about it can\u2019\u0095t understand how that could happen. They simply can\u2019t relate to that kind of criminal activity.\u201d\n\nInterviewed November 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Emmett Till, Drew, Miss., 1955.\n\nIn what is one of the most significant race-related events in the history of the United States, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Chicago native, was brutally lynched in rural Mississippi on Aug. 28, 1955. Till, who had been visiting family members in the area, entered a local white-owned grocery store in the town of Money for less than one minute. Whatever was said between him and the proprietor, Carolyn Bryant, was used as the pretext for his murder. Four days later Till was abducted from his uncle\u2019\u0095s house by Roy Bryant, Carolyn\u2019\u0095s husband, and J.W. Milam and driven to a nearby barn where he was severely beaten and tortured (the original wall of the barn can be seen on the left of the photograph). He was then taken to the Tallahatchie River, shot in the head, and drowned with a cotton gin fan tied around his neck. In an infamous court case both defendants were found \u0094not guilty\u0095 by an all-white jury. Months later they sold their story and admitted their guilt, with Bryant claiming that the Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education that desegregated schools was a mistake. Emmett Till\u2019s mother, Mamie Till Bradley, allowed photos to be taken of her son\u2019s broken and swollen body because she \u201cwanted the world to see what they did to my baby.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nDr. Jeffrey Andrews, Drew, Miss.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know the history of the property when I purchased it in 2003 and it was only two years later that a few local people told me of the Emmett Till murder. I\u2019ve lived in Drew since I was 12 and I had never heard of it. I\u2019ve since modified the barn to make it more functional and useful, and someone once asked me why I would change a historical site, but history is in the past and people should move on. Things have changed drastically here in the Mississippi Delta region and race relations are at all-time high. History is an important learning tool and it should be used to help people move forward, but one thing you have to remember is that people here don\u2019t want to be constantly reminded of how things were 60 years ago. We\u2019ve all moved forward, and sometimes people aren\u2019t given enough credit for the changes we\u2019ve made. I respect everyone\u2019s feelings towards Emmett Till, and I\u2019ve met some of his family members. They\u2019re great people. This has been a learning experience for my family and we appreciate the fact that we\u2019re part of a historical site.\u201d\n\nInterviewed March 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Joe Coe, Omaha, 1891\n\nOn Oct. 10, 1891, a 50-year-old African-American named Joe Coe (also known as George Smith) was accused of sexually assaulting a 5-year-old girl and was quickly arrested. Rumors spread that the girl had died and that Coe would get off lightly, neither of which was true. A frenzied mob seized him from the jail at the Douglas County Courthouse, put a rope around his neck, and dragged his body through the streets. Coe was then hanged from a streetcar wire on the corner of 17th and Harney in front of thousands of onlookers. Souvenirs of the rope were later sold. Mayor Richard C. Cushing of Omaha condemned the lynching as \u201c\u0094the most deplorable thing that has ever happened in the history of the country.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Ell Persons, Memphis, 1917\n\nWhen the decapitated body of a 16-year-old local, Antoinette Rappel, was found near the old Wolf River Bridge in May 1917, Ell Persons, a local black woodcutter, was deemed a possible suspect. Despite being arrested and released twice, he was captured a third time and forced to confess. A local mob announced that he was to be lynched the next day. The news spread, and a crowd of 3,000 turned up to witness his lynching (including students of Central High School). Ell Persons was burned on a makeshift pyre in a carnival-like atmosphere. He was then decapitated, and his head was taken to the predominantly African-American Beale Street and thrown at locals. A century later his lynching was commemorated and a historic marker was erected near the site.\n\nImage\n\nAmal Altareb, Memphis\n\n\u201cI came to America in 2012 from Yemen. I\u2019m still learning the language and the history, and it wasn\u2019t until the spring of last year that I learned about lynchings. I knew some of the history of segregation and Jim Crow laws, and I knew how unfair the system was \u2014 that African-Americans weren\u2019t treated as equals \u2014 but I didn\u2019t know that human beings had been burned or hanged from a tree just because of their race. Last year my class at Central High School were discussing it and I asked what lynchings were and they were surprised that I didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s surprising that humans can go so far as to kill someone else in this way and create a festival-like atmosphere. There were even spectators. Uncovering the truth is painful, but it\u2019s important. The African-American students especially don\u2019t talk about it because it\u2019s painful, and it reminds them of the injustices towards their race. White Americans don\u2019t want to remember either because of the guilt they feel. I can understand why people want to avoid the topic, but we need to face history in order to move forward.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Leo Frank, Marietta, Ga., 1915\n\nMary Phagan, 13, was found dead on April 26, 1913, at a National Pencil Company factory where she worked. Amid an atmosphere of anti-Semitism and despite conflicting evidence, a Jewish superintendent named Leo Frank was convicted of the crime. Frank\u2019s sentence was later commuted from the death penalty to life imprisonment, a decision that led a mob on Aug. 17, 1915, to seize him from state prison and lynch him from a tree in Marietta, Mary Phagan\u2019s hometown. Later that year the second chapter of the Ku Klux Klan was founded on Stone Mountain, with a number of Leo Frank\u2019s murderers present. Leo Frank was posthumously pardoned in 1986.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of George W. Murray, Mae Murray Dorsey, Roger Malcom and Dorothy Malcolm, Walton County, Georgia, 1946\n\nAfter Roger Malcom, a World War II veteran and Georgia sharecropper, had been bailed out of jail after allegedly stabbing a white man, members of the local community decided to take revenge. On July 25, 1946, a mob of 15 to 20 stopped the car Malcom was riding in with his wife, Dorothy, and another couple, George W. Murray and Mae Murray Dorsey, who was pregnant. They tied the four of them to a nearby tree and shot them to death. Mae Murray Dorsey then had her unborn baby ripped out of her. Despite an F.B.I. investigation nobody was brought to trial for the crime, and a few months later a grand jury was \u201cunable to establish the identity of any persons guilty of violating the civil rights statute of the United States.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nCeleste Butler, Omaha\n\n\u201cTracing one\u2019s roots and one\u2019s history is hard, especially as an African-American. These are big questions we all want to know: Who are we and where do we come from? I had DNA testing done recently but it didn\u2019t lead anywhere. It just told me that my ancestors came from West Africa, but it couldn\u2019t say where exactly. Missing that part and not being able to hand it down to my children or grandchildren is frustrating. On top of that you hear some people in this country telling black people to \u2018go back home.\u2019 Home to what? Home to whom? It feels like a total assault both mentally and physically to have chapters and generations missing. Not being able to fill that void is difficult. When it comes to racial violence I feel like we\u2019re constantly suffering from PTSD. It\u2019s a stress that never really goes away. A lot of people suffer in pain and in silence, and they suffer for successive generations. Everything was stripped from us, and we\u2019ve been struggling to put the pieces back together ever since.\u201d\n\nInterviewed September 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Michael Donald, Mobile, Ala., 1981\n\nMichael Donald, 19, was abducted on March 21, 1981, by Henry Hays and James Knowles as he was walking home. They beat him, slit his throat, and hanged his body from a tree outside 114 Herndon Avenue. The pretext for Donald\u2019s murder was a \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict handed down by a partially black jury to an African-American man accused of killing a white police officer. This incensed the Alabama chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, led by Benny Jack Hays, the father of Henry Hays, who suggested killing a random black person in response. Michael Donald\u2019s mother, Beulah Mae Donald, with the help of the Southern Poverty Law Center, brought a case not just against the killers but also the United Klans of America. Beulah Mae Donald won the case and received $7 million in damages, essentially bankrupting the U.K.A. Henry Hays was executed, while Knowles received life imprisonment. Hays is the only known Klan member to have been executed in the 20th century for the murder of an African-American. Herndon Avenue has since been renamed Michael Donald Avenue and a historic marker has been erected.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Mulugeta Seraw, Portland, Ore., 1988\n\nOn the evening of Nov. 13, 1988, an Ethiopian student named Mulugeta Seraw was being dropped off at his apartment when he was attacked by Kenneth Mieske, Kyle Brewster and Steve Strasser, members of a local racist skinhead group called East Side White Pride. Mieske delivered the fatal blows with a baseball bat. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 1990 Seraw\u2019s family, represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, brought a civil lawsuit against the killers\u2019 affiliated group, the White Aryan Nation, and its leaders, Tom and John Metzger, for $12.5 million. Tom Metzger later said that the killers had done their \u201ccivic duty\u201d by killing Seraw.\n\nImage\n\nJason Downard, Portland, Ore.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 2 I was put into foster care, and in 2009 I went to prison for a gang-affiliated drive-by shooting. I didn\u2019t grow up racist, but in prison the racist skinheads pulled me into their group and drilled stuff into my head about how the media is run by Jews and that they wanted an all-white nation. I also got a tattoo of a swastika on my leg, which I\u2019ve since had covered up. It\u2019s a painful reminder. The skinheads showed me support and love and compassion, which I hadn\u2019t experienced before in my life; everyone is looking for some kind of acceptance. I was angry and uncomfortable with who I was, and I drove that anger towards people who didn\u2019t look like me. In the last two years of the movement my sister had a son with a black guy and my nephew would give me this look like he knew what I was about. I started to get a guilty conscience and began to think about the things I thought I believed in. My sister said I\u2019d been brainwashed, and I can see why. The movement just taught me to hate and reinforced those views. The problem of racism in this country is much deeper than many people think. When it comes to Trump, he\u2019s tacitly endorsed the alt-right and white supremacists. It\u2019s been a ripple effect and things have gotten worse since he came into power. The right now feel emboldened. I look back now at some of the things I\u2019ve done and I realize that I\u2019ve hurt a lot of people. I decided I wanted to help others who had been in a similar position to me, and that\u2019s been my mission ever since. Now I work for an organization called Life After Hate. I\u2019m a marked man, and maybe I\u2019ll die doing this, but at least I\u2019ll die knowing I did the right thing.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Murder Site of Timothy Caughman, New York City, 2017\n\nOn March 17, 2017 James Harris Jackson traveled from his home in Baltimore to New York City with the intention of killing random black men. The reason, he later told police, was his hatred of interracial relationships. Three days later he found Timothy Caughman, 66, collecting cans in a trash bin on the corner of West 36th and 9th Avenue and stabbed him multiple times with an 18-inch sword. Caughman died of his injuries that night, and two days later Jackson turned himself in, telling police that he had planned to kill more black men in Times Square. On March 27, Jackson was charged with one count each of murder in the first and second degrees as an act of terrorism, second-degree murder as a hate crime, and three counts of criminal possession of a weapon.\n\n\u201cThe Spaces We Inherit,\u201d which will be published as a book by Overlapse in October 2018, is available for pre-order.\n\nFollow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

Though his inquiry is intensely, at times painfully personal, Mr. Wilkerson is above all concerned with unpacking the mechanisms of racial domination. The procedure is akin to performing surgery on a half-conscious subject, or digging up a buried land mine that has lost little of its explosive power.\n\nVideo\n\nThe focus of his excavation is a killing that took place in Dothan, Ala., in 1946, when S.E. Branch, a white shopkeeper, shot Bill Spann, a black man who was in his store. Branch, Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s great-grandfather, was charged with first-degree murder, but no trial was ever held, and the crime faded from memory. Or rather, the memory of it was quietly and systematically suppressed. All that remains are a short newspaper article and a few photographs and home movies of the killer.\n\n\u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d proceeds on several parallel tracks. Mr. Wilkerson returns to Alabama and tries to discover both how Bill Spann died and how he was forgotten. His investigation, accompanied by haunting images of Southern back roads and quiet houses, is punctuated by reminders that Bill Spann\u2019s death is hardly a unique or anomalous event. The names of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and other recent victims of racist violence appear onscreen, and two songs of protest loop into the soundtrack: Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s \u201cHell You Talmbout\u201d and Phil Ochs\u2019s \u201cWilliam Moore.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat song, about a white postal worker and civil rights activist murdered on an Alabama highway in 1963, is the source of the film\u2019s title and a part of its wider cultural context. \u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d is a passionately political film, aflame with rage in spite of its director\u2019s measured, ruminative tone of voice. It is also a horror movie, full of specters and silences and a terror that is pervasive, intimate and elusive.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Wilkerson, whose previous films include \u201cAn Injury to One\u201d and \u201cFar From Afghanistan,\u201d dispenses with many of the usual techniques of historical documentary. There are a few on-camera interviews, with neighbors and relatives, but more frequently Mr. Wilkerson narrates encounters that took place off camera. And his sleuthing often leads not to moments of revelation but to dead ends and deeper mysteries. The insertion of clips from \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d provides a chilling and ironic counterpoint to the grim story this movie is telling. S.E. Branch is the opposite of Gregory Peck\u2019s brave and decent Atticus Finch, and the truth about what happened to Bill Spann resists the kind of redemptive, healing conclusion that remains a cornerstone of American racial fantasy.\n\nInstead of consolation, Mr. Wilkerson offers commitment. Instead of idealism, honesty. He doesn\u2019t suppose that his film will solve anything, but there is nonetheless something profoundly useful about the way he confronts past and present manifestations of white supremacy. He links his great-grandfather\u2019s crime to the contemporaneous gang rape of Recy Taylor (the subject of an excellent recent documentary by Nancy Buirski), and uncovers patterns of abuse within his family. He corresponds with a relative who is part of a white nationalist, \u201cSouthern secessionist\u201d group. He notes the way racial injustice dwells in apparently mundane facts. The killer is immortalized in pictures and a well-kept tombstone. His victim has been almost entirely erased from memory, a kind of second death beyond the reach of redress or revenge.", "keywords": ["mr", "review", "bill", "racial", "spann", "reckons", "fired", "white", "wilkerson", "wonder", "movie", "memory", "gun", "supremacy"], "polarity": 0.04540441176470589, "subjectivity": 0.3202205882352941},

It is typical for far-right politicians who want to attract racist, xenophobic or nativist voters to attempt to provide at least the pretense of reasons, invariably shoddy ones, for animus against racial minorities, immigrants, or foreigners.\n\nIn the United States, President Trump regularly connects individual crimes or criminal gangs with immigration in an effort to more broadly establish a link between immigrants with crime in the public consciousness. Though studies have shown that immigrants, both legal and illegal, are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans, Trump continues to make such claims (his statement that immigrants bring \u201ctremendous amounts of crime\u201d received a score of \u201cfour Pinocchios\u201d from fact-checkers).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSimilarly bizarre false claims are made by non-American far-right politicians, who also regularly engage in anti-Semitic innuendo. There is a natural next step to using innuendo and the manufacturing of reasons to justify racism and xenophobia \u2014 namely to drop the facade altogether. Bannon is urging the adoption of an irrational bias against racial minorities, immigrants and foreigners, one that does not require reasons, even bad ones, to support it.

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/12/opinion/devos-school-prison-pipeline.html", "text": "Advertisement\n\nMichelle Goldberg Will Betsy DeVos Expand the School-to-Prison Pipeline? Image Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, left, during an interview with Lesley Stahl on \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d Credit CBS\n\nOn Sunday evening, CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d broadcast an interview that Lesley Stahl conducted with Betsy DeVos, Donald Trump\u2019s education secretary and one of the richest members of his very rich cabinet. It was overwhelmingly seen as a disaster for DeVos, who struggled to answer very basic questions. She couldn\u2019t say, for example, why schools in Michigan, her home state, have largely gotten worse since the widespread introduction of the school choice policies she lobbied for. When Stahl asked whether, as secretary, she\u2019d ever visited a failing school to find out what went wrong, DeVos said, \u201cI have not intentionally visited schools that are underperforming.\u201d\n\nLike many things in Trump\u2019s administration, this performance was shocking but not surprising. Before becoming secretary of education, DeVos had never worked as an educator or a policymaker; she was a donor to education reform efforts favored by the right, such as school choice and vouchers. Her confirmation hearings last year were an embarrassment. She appeared to be unfamiliar with the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, a federal civil rights law. After taking office, she described historically black universities and colleges, founded in response to segregation, as \u201cpioneers when it comes to school choice.\u201d\n\nAs this comment suggested, DeVos is, at best, oblivious about race. That obliviousness \u2014 or worse \u2014 is behind one of the more disturbing moments in her \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview. In a sick irony, some on the right would use the recent school shooting in Parkland, Fla. \u2014 allegedly committed by a young man who carved swastikas into the magazines for his semiautomatic rifle \u2014 as a pretext to roll back civil rights protections for students of color. On \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d DeVos, whom Trump has chosen to lead his new school safety commission, appeared to signal she\u2019s on board.\n\nTo understand how, we need to start with a letter that Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, sent to DeVos and Attorney General Jeff Sessions on March 5 about the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\nRubio referred to a 2014 Barack Obama-era directive, known as the Dear Colleague Letter on the Nondiscriminatory Administration of School Discipline, intended to address the so-called school-to-prison pipeline, in which disadvantaged students are funneled into the criminal justice system for misbehaving at school. The Dear Colleague Letter said school personnel must \u201cunderstand that they, rather than school resource officers and other security or law enforcement personnel, are responsible for administering routine student discipline.\u201d\n\nWithout citing any evidence, Rubio wrote that this guidance \u201cmay have contributed to systemic failures\u201d to report the suspected Parkland gunman, Nikolas Cruz, to the police, and asked DeVos to revise it. Ann Coulter made a similar argument in a column published in Breitbart: \u201cCruz\u2019s criminal acts were intentionally ignored by law enforcement on account of Broward\u2019s much-celebrated \u2018school-to-prison pipeline\u2019 reforms.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe logic that people try to manufacture is that the effort to end exclusionary school discipline renders schools unsafe places,\u201d Catherine Lhamon, who served as assistant secretary for civil rights in Obama\u2019s Department of Education, told me. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even bear scrutiny, really.\u201d\n\nBut in this administration it doesn\u2019t have to. DeVos isn\u2019t just considering ending the policy. Speaking to Stahl, she refused to even admit that race plays a role in discipline.\n\nAmong experts, this isn\u2019t really a subject for debate. \u201cThere\u2019s some fairly good empirical evidence that says minority students are more likely than white students in similar situations to be written up and disciplined,\u201d said Michael Hansen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies education policy.\n\nSpeaking to DeVos, Stahl compared situations in which white kids are punished for classroom disruption by a trip to the principal\u2019s office, while for black kids, \u201cthey call in the cops.\u201d DeVos refused to say such a discrepancy is wrong: \u201cArguably, all of these issues or all of this issue comes down to individual kids.\u201d Stahl pressed her on whether this \u201cdisproportion in discipline\u201d constitutes \u201cinstitutional racism.\u201d DeVos said she was committed to \u201cmaking sure students have opportunity to learn in safe and nurturing environments.\u201d\n\nThe comparison Stahl offered was a hypothetical, but it captured the heart of the issue. Black public school students are suspended at 3.8 times the rate of white students. That discrepancy alone doesn\u2019t necessarily demonstrate discrimination, but there\u2019s evidence that students of color are punished differently from white students for the same infractions. Lhamon told me about one elementary school where a black girl was suspended for poking a student with a pencil. When a white girl in the same grade threw a rock that hit another child in the head and broke the teacher\u2019s sunglasses, she was made to help the teacher clean the classroom during lunch.\n\nThe DeVos interview has already sent a message that schools can be less mindful of stark disciplinary disparities. Combine this tacit license to discriminate with the Trump administration plan to encourage the arming of teachers, and you have a recipe for something combustible. There\u2019s a lesson here that applies across the administration. Don\u2019t let the clownishness distract you from the bigotry.", "keywords": ["administration", "schools", "students", "devos", "white", "pipeline", "secretary", "minutes", "opinion", "betsy", "school", "stahl", "education", "expand", "schooltoprison"], "polarity": 0.026021589521589516, "subjectivity": 0.46782511932511933},

The show gave me the \u201cendorsement\u201d I had been craving all my (short) life.\n\n\u2014 Alex Gonzalez\n\nThe first time I saw myself on the big screen was when \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d came out and had Hattie McDaniel as the maid. I am 74 years old and I have seen a lot of racism in my life but \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d was the worst. It depicted a black women as a slave, who at the same time had power. At the time of the film I didn\u2019t really understand a lot about racism and the fact that I was a second-class person. A lot has changed, but a lot has not.\n\n\u2014 Gwendolyn Morgan\n\nI always liked \u201cIn the Heat of the Night\u201d because as a well-spoken, professional black man, I have found myself in Sidney Poitier\u2019s character\u2019s position: People can\u2019t figure me out. Like when someone asks Poitier: \u201cWhy are you wearing white man\u2019s clothes?\u201d I get that look today sometimes!\n\n\u2014 Andre Graves\n\nI first saw black actors who made an impression on me during the 1970s era of Blaxploitation films. \u201cShaft,\u201d \u201cSuperfly,\u201d Pam Grier, etc ... They looked like people in my St. Albans and Jamaica, Queens, neighborhood.\n\n\u2014 DeBorah Palmer\n\nI remember watching \u201cMulan,\u201d which came out when I was in middle school, and absolutely freaking out. I\u2019m not Chinese; I\u2019m Korean and was adopted by a white family as a baby, but in a media landscape that still largely excludes people of East Asian descent, I\u2019ll celebrate what I can get.\n\n\u2014 Amanda McClendon\n\nI\u2019m a white woman. Moira Shearer in \u201cRed Shoes.\u201d I was perhaps 8 years old. I grew up in a small town in North Texas. As a child I loved \u201cSong of the South\u201d and had read \u201cUncle Remus\u201d before I saw it. I know it\u2019s not politically correct now, but this film mirrored the kindness, warmth and wisdom I received as a child from African-Americans who worked in our house.\n\n\u2014 Mavis Bryant\n\nAs a black South African, and an African in particular, I felt a deep sense of joy at how \u201cBlack Panther\u201d tried to portray African culture. For once, Africans were good people in a movie, although it was fictional.\n\n\u2014 Khalifah Makgotlho\n\nThe 1972 film \u201cBlack Girl,\u201d starring Peggy Pettit as an aspiring modern dancer. Despite her three envy-ridden older sisters, who try to crush her dreams, she triumphs in the end. Perhaps it was the start of my dreams of moving to New York to pursue my career.\n\n\u2014 Deborah Sanders\n\nImage Fa Zhou and his daughter Mulan in the film \"Mulan.\" Credit Walt Disney Pictures\n\nSince before I can remember, the movie \u201cMulan\u201d has guided my understanding of empowerment and representation. As someone adopted from China and raised in a predominantly white town, \u201cMulan\u201d was my premier exposure to Asian beauty and culture. Her story\u2019s message about turning adversity into strength sticks with me always.\n\n\u2014 MaiLei Meyers\n\nThe first time I saw gay men represented in film, who felt real and relatable, was in \u201cMy Beautiful Laundrette.\u201d Being gay isn\u2019t what the movie was about, these two characters just were, and that one was brown and the other white and working class made it even better.\n\n\u2014 Michael Ginther\n\n\u201cDrumline,\u201d featuring Nick Cannon, in 2002 and \u201cYou Got Served\u201d in 2004. Both those movies, seen at age 7 and 9, inspired me to become the drummer and dancer I am today, at 23. It was impossible to know then, but representation matters!\n\n\u2014 Taylor Alarcon\n\nI\u2019m still waiting for representation. The closest I\u2019ve come is with \u201cSmoke Signals.\u201d But as a biracial person, I\u2019m not a \u201creal\u201d Native American, according to some, but I also wasn\u2019t raised like my white peers. I believe that this constant social navigation is ripe for exploration.\n\n\u2014 India Lovato\n\nIn 1988, I saw \u201cThe Milagro Beanfield War.\u201d Most of the characters were Mexican and they were just portrayed as people, not some \u201cFrito Bandito\u201d joke. It made me want to cry with relief.\n\n\u2014 Dawn Reed\n\nGrowing up Italian and plus-size, I never saw women like me in the movies. The closest thing to representation I saw was \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d but my family wasn\u2019t violent or in organized crime so I couldn\u2019t relate. I\u2019m still waiting to see characters like me.\n\n\u2014 Tiffany Magazzeni\n\nI\u2019m still waiting to see myself. I mean there is Michelle Yeoh, an Asian actress in the 1997 movie \u201cTomorrow Never Dies.\u201d She\u2019s not me, but I loved that her character defies the usual Hollywood stereotypes for Asians. But she is not American and I\u2019m not at all a Bond woman. I grew up watching movies and I love the old Hollywood movies especially, but it makes me sad to realize that Hollywood\u2019s portrayal of Asians has been mocking or missing for most of its history. Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan are also imports. There just aren\u2019t any homegrown Asian-American filmmakers yet.\n\n\u2014 Lillian Hsu\n\nI am an African-American man born in 1960, raised in Southern California. The first time I remember seeing someone who looked like me represented on screen in the way I saw myself was in 1967. It was Jim Brown in \u201cThe Dirty Dozen\u201d: a strong, brave, athletic black man fighting with the good guys against the bad guys.\n\n\u2014 Darren Casonhua\n\nIt may seem bizarre, but \u201cMoonlight\u201d helped me better understand myself as an upper-middle-class heterosexual white woman growing up in the Midwest. Through some common coming-of-age feelings of loneliness and confusion, but also in better understanding the differences, I learned more about myself.\n\n\u2014 Sally Otis\n\nAlthough I am white, I am Jewish with \u201cbig\u201d hair, raised in the Bronx. I saw myself reflected in \u201cFunny Girl.\u201d With a New York City backdrop, song lyrics and Barbra Streisand\u2019s delivery, I felt for the first time, in the eyes of the larger world, at age 12, accepted.\n\n\u2014 Jill Sager\n\nImage Diahann Carroll and Sidney Poitier in \"Paris Blues.\" Credit Kino Lorber\n\nI am 70 years old and watched classic Hollywood movies on television during the 1950s and \u201960s. The first film I saw people who looked like me and behaved in ways I recognized was \u201cParis Blues\u201d with Sidney Poitier and Diahann Carroll, who were in love and kissed on screen. Amazing!\n\n\u2014 Donna Bailey\n\nThe first time I saw myself represented was in high school. Spike Lee made an all-black musical, \u201cSchool Daze,\u201d and I was in awe. I clearly remember sitting in my seat amazed at seeing all of the different shades of black people on the big screen and feeling proud because I was finally being seen through them.\n\n\u2014 Cathleen Jagarnauth\n\nI\u2019m a white, 68-year-old woman and the first time I saw myself on the screen was in 1987 when Holly Hunter was in \u201cBroadcast News.\u201d She was opinionated, pushy, demanding and terribly emotionally fragile, taking a few minutes to cry. When her producer told her it must be nice to know exactly what everyone else should be doing, she said, \u201cNo. It\u2019s horrible.\u201d When the movie ended I literally sat in the movie theater and cried in recognition.\n\n\u2014 Carolyn Langenkamp\n\nFor more coverage of race, sign up to have our newsletter delivered weekly to your inbox.", "keywords": ["representation", "im", "black", "movies", "mirror", "white", "screen", "movie", "mulan", "saw", "hollywood", "film"], "polarity": 0.10436236628385391, "subjectivity": 0.37851373832778806},
{"title": "\n                    Google Is Trying Too Hard (or Not Hard Enough) to Diversify                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/09/technology/google-diversity-lawsuits.html", "text": "\u201cMy impression is that Google is not sure what to do,\u201d said Michelle Miller, a co-executive director at Coworker.org, a workers\u2019 rights organization that has been working with some Google employees. \u201cIt prevents the ability of a company to function when one group of workers is obstinately focused on defeating their co-workers with whatever it takes.\u201d\n\nThe division within Google spilled into the open last year when James Damore, a software engineer, wrote a memo critical of its diversity programs. He argued that biological differences and not a lack of opportunity explained the shortage of women in leadership and technical positions.\n\nGoogle fired Mr. Damore. He filed a lawsuit in January with another former employee, claiming that the company discriminates against white men with conservative views. In a separate lawsuit, a former recruiter for YouTube sued Google because, he said, he was fired for resisting a mandate to hire only diverse \u2014 female or black and Latino \u2014 candidates.\n\nGoogle\u2019s handling of the issue was also upsetting to Mr. Damore\u2019s critics. In another lawsuit filed last month, a former Google employee said he was fired because he was too outspoken in advocating diversity and for spending too much time on \u201csocial activism.\u201d\n\nInside Google, vocal diversity proponents say they are the targets of a small group of employees who are sympathetic to Mr. Damore. In some cases, screenshots of comments made on an internal social network were leaked to online forums frequented by right-wing groups, which searched for and published personal information like home addresses and phone numbers of the Google employees, they said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2015, Google started an internal program called Respect@, which includes a way for employees to anonymously report complaints of inappropriate behavior by co-workers. Some diversity supporters say other employees are taking advantage of this program to accuse them of harassment for out-of-context statements.\n\n\u201cSome people feel threatened by movements that promote diversity and inclusion. They think it means people are going to come for their jobs,\u201d said Liz Fong-Jones, a Google engineer who is a vocal supporter of diversity.\n\nMany big tech companies are struggling with the challenge of creating a more diverse work force. In 2015, Facebook adopted the so-called Rooney Rule. Originally used by the National Football League to prod teams to consider coaching prospects who are black, the rule requires managers to interview candidates from underrepresented backgrounds for open positions. But last year, Facebook\u2019s female engineers said that gender bias was still a problem and that their work received more scrutiny than men\u2019s work.\n\nEven executives tasked with promoting diversity have had difficulties. In October, Denise Young Smith, who was Apple\u2019s vice president of inclusion and diversity, came under fire when she said that there was diversity even among 12 white, blue-eyed, blond men because they had different backgrounds and experiences. She later apologized, saying she did not intend to play down the importance of a non-homogenous work force. She left Apple in December.\n\nThe tension is elevated at Google, at least in part, by its workplace culture. Google has encouraged employees to express themselves and challenge one another. It provides many communication systems for people to discuss work and nonwork related issues. Even topics considered out of bounds at other workplaces \u2014 like sharp criticism of its own products \u2014 are discussed openly and celebrated.\n\nIn January, on one of Google\u2019s 90,000 \u201cgroups\u201d \u2014 internal email lists around a discussion topic \u2014 an employee urged colleagues to donate money to help pay Mr. Damore\u2019s legal fees from his lawsuit against Google to promote \u201cviewpoint diversity,\u201d according to a person who saw the posting but is not permitted to share the information publicly.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He said he had meant that being a Republican did not exempt Google employees from following the company\u2019s code of conduct.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA Google spokeswoman said in a statement that the company encouraged lively debate. But there are limits.\n\n\u201cCreating a more diverse workplace is a big challenge and a priority we\u2019ve been working to address. Some people won\u2019t agree with our approach, and they\u2019re free to express their disagreement,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Gina Scigliano. \u201cBut some conduct and discussion in the workplace crosses a line, and we don\u2019t tolerate it. We enforce strong policies, and work with affected employees, to ensure everyone can do their work free of harassment, discrimination and bullying.\u201d\n\nIn the past, discussions about diversity in Google\u2019s online chat groups would encounter skeptical but subtle comments or questions. The debate turned openly antagonistic after Mr. Damore\u2019s memo, which was titled \u201cGoogle\u2019s Ideological Echo Chamber.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe James Damore thing brought everything to a head,\u201d said Vicki Holland, a linguist who has worked at Google for seven years. \u201cIt brought everything to the surface where everyone could see it.\u201d\n\nMr. Damore said he began to question Google\u2019s diversity policies at a weekly company meeting last March. At the meeting, Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s vice president of people operations, \u201cpointed out and shamed\u201d departments in which women accounted for less than half the staff, according to Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe two female executives \u2014 who are among the company\u2019s highest-ranking women \u2014 said Google\u2019s \u201cracial and gender preferences were not up for debate,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Mr. Damore subsequently attended a \u201cDiversity and Inclusion Summit,\u201d where it reinforced his view that Google was \u201celevating political correctness over merit\u201d with its diversity measures.\n\nMr. Damore said he had written his memo afterward in response.\n\nMs. Scigliano, the Google spokeswoman, said the company looked forward to fighting Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit in court. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said in an August blog post that he had fired Mr. Damore because his memo advanced \u201charmful gender stereotypes\u201d but that \u201cmuch of the memo is fair to debate.\u201d\n\nSome employees said they were abstaining from internal debate on sensitive issues because they worried that their comments might be misconstrued or used against them. Like the broader internet, the conversations tend to be dominated by the loudest voices, they said.\n\nGoogle\u2019s diversity advocates said they would like to see more moderation on internal forums with officials stepping in to defuse tensions before conversations get out of hand. Ms. Miller, the Coworker.org co-director, said Google employees had expressed concern about how this would affect an internal culture rooted in transparency and free expression.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s on everyone\u2019s mind is: Has the culture been inextricably damaged by this environment?\u201d she said.", "keywords": ["googles", "mr", "hard", "internal", "work", "fired", "google", "diversity", "lawsuit", "damore", "diversify", "employees", "trying"], "polarity": 0.08552789802789805, "subjectivity": 0.3460065686628187},

Ms. Freiman declined to comment further.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe timing raised questions about whether Ms. Freiman\u2019s activist agenda gave the university or the I.C.A. board cold feet. Asked if her resignation had to do with the direction Ms. Freiman was taking the institute, or rather her management style, William A. Royall Jr., co-chairman of the I.C.A. board, said: \u201cThere were no reservations about the curatorial direction she was taking whatsoever,\u201d without addressing the rest.\n\nThe show will go on as planned, led by the I.C.A.\u2019s chief curator, Stephanie Smith. \u201cThe exhibition is functioning as a declaration of intent for the I.C.A. being an institution that\u2019s going to grapple directly with issues that matter in our world through supporting artists\u2019 diverse voices,\u201d Ms. Smith said.\n\nAlmost half the artists have been commissioned to make new work for the show. Tania Bruguera, Hope Ginsburg, Titus Kaphar, Lee Mingwei, Amalia Pica and Betty Tompkins, among others, deal head on with issues of race, gender, the environment, social dysphoria and the possibility for repair.\n\nPhoto\n\nAmos Paul Kennedy Jr., a letterpress printmaker based in Detroit, collaborated with barbershops and salons near the I.C.A., social sites where the African-American population in particular gathers. \u201cHe thought that would be a great way to reach out and speak to an audience that might not otherwise be aware of the I.C.A. or think that it was a place for them,\u201d Ms. Smith said. Over the course of six months, the artist collected snippets of conversation from patrons on issues of the day.\n\nMr. Kennedy then distilled the text into hundreds of brightly colored letterpress prints that will wallpaper the entrance wall to the I.C.A. \u201cRichmond citizens will walk in and see their own voices reflected on the wall of the institution,\u201d Ms. Smith said.\n\nMr. Rucker, who is in residence at V.C.U., working with students, is interspersing historical artifacts related to the Ku Klux Klan with his refashioned Klansmen robes. The symbolism of the piece is complicated. Does it \u201creflect the ways institutionalized racism has in some cases been camouflaged within our current culture,\u201d posed Ms. Smith, or is it \u201ca Judo move neutralizing a symbol of oppression by transforming it into something that is the artist\u2019s own?\u201d\n\nSuch nuanced questions are bound to reverberate loudly in this city. \u201cThe I.C.A. sets itself in this really rich environment, equidistant from Monument Avenue, Lumpkin\u2019s jail in the center of the slave trade, the tobacco industry, the financial district and Jackson Ward, this amazing center of black entrepreneurship,\u201d said William Martin, director of the Valentine, a nearby museum dedicated to Richmond\u2019s history. \u201cThose of us downtown are surrounded by these tensions of Richmond\u2019s history.

The Baptist part is inherited, like baldness or dimples: Both of my grandfathers and three of my uncles were Baptist preachers, and my parents met as graduate students at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Genes aside, the church \u2014 plastic chairs, pilling carpet and grape juice for communion \u2014 was the organizing institution of my childhood, where I met my closest friends and most of the significant adults in my life.\n\nChurch attendance has been in generational decline. I began calling around, exploring whether people in small towns were looking for community elsewhere and, with the white nationalist rallies so often in the news, whether young white people were looking for meaning in the grim sanctuaries of the alt-right.\n\nBut I kept hearing about something different. Pastors, theologians and sociologists were talking of how black worshipers were leaving white-majority churches. They were leaving quietly and not en masse, a family here, a single person there. But it was happening everywhere, a movement large enough for some to see the unraveling of decades of efforts at racial reconciliation.\n\nI would find someone on Facebook, a black worshiper who had posted about leaving her mostly white church, and then I would find someone in the same situation halfway across the country. They would both think they were going through this alone, yet the accounts would be remarkably similar, the timelines nearly identical, even some of the words and phrases the same. There had been, I discovered, some sharp reporting about this, particularly from the writer Deborah Jian Lee, but not as much as you would expect for an experience that seemed to be this broadly shared.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPeople spoke to me of being tired, let down, heartbroken. Political and cultural partitions that they had long overlooked at worship time now overshadowed every service. The realizations almost always began with the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012, and a sense that white church leaders or fellow worshipers did not want to talk about how a black teenager walking home from a 7-Eleven could end up dead. Sometimes the preacher would privately express sympathy, but also concern about how his white congregation would take it. Maybe there would be a meeting.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

As Nils Gilman argues in The American Interest, that ideal reached its apogee with the election of Barack Obama.\n\nBut Obama\u2019s election also revealed the limits of that ideal.

Progress is less about understanding and liking each other and more about smashing structures that others defend.\n\nThe second thing that happened was that reason, apparently, ceased to matter. Today\u2019s young people were raised within an educational ideology that taught them that individual reason and emotion were less important than perspectivism \u2014 what perspective you bring as a white man, a black woman, a transgender Mexican, or whatever.\n\nThese students were raised with the idea that individual reason is downstream from group identity. Then along came the 2016 election to validate that point of view! If reason and deliberation are central to democracy, how on earth did Donald Trump get elected?\n\nIf you were born after 1990, it\u2019s not totally shocking that you would see public life as an inevitable war of tribe versus tribe.

The powerful few keep everyone else down. The solutions to injustice and suffering are simple and obvious: Defeat the powerful. Passion is more important than reason because the oppressed masses have to mobilize to storm the barricades. Debate is counterproductive because it dilutes passion and sows confusion. Discordant ideas are not there to inform; they are there to provide cover for oppression.\n\nSome people I admire see today\u2019s student mobbism as an outbreak of an ersatz religion, but I\u2019d say their theory of social change is at least comprehensible given the era they inhabit.\n\nIf I could talk to the students I\u2019d try to persuade them that mistake theory is a more accurate and effective way to change the world than conflict theory, but I probably wouldn\u2019t persuade them.\n\nSo I\u2019d just ask them to take two courses.

Their hope was that by sharing their stories they could start dialogues and inspire change.\n\nI could identify; I knew what it was like to sometimes feel like an outsider. And as an editor at The Times, I wondered what I could do to advance the conversation.\n\nAn answer came as I was researching an obit for a woman in the tennis world. I discovered the story of Mary Ewing Outerbridge when I stumbled upon a website crediting her with introducing tennis to America. I wondered if she had received a Times obituary when she died in 1886. I checked our digital newspaper archives. She had not.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter that, anytime I came across an interesting person who died years ago, I searched our archives for an obit. Those who didn\u2019t get one were, not surprisingly, largely women and people of color. I started talking about my research with colleagues, friends and relatives, all of whom began sending me more names.\n\nI soon had a list of dozens of fascinating people, such as Ms. Larsen; Madhubala, a Bollywood actress whose poetically tragic life was cut short; and Margaret Abbott, a golfer who died without ever knowing that she was the first American woman to win an Olympic championship.\n\nEven more surprising were some blatant omissions of those who had achieved a measure of fame in their lifetime, like the poet Sylvia Plath, the writer Charlotte Bront\u00eb and the photographer Diane Arbus.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t they get obits? I can only speculate. Perhaps the mark they made on the world wasn\u2019t recognized until decades after their deaths. Or maybe some of them faded into obscurity, their achievements forgotten. It could be that The Times didn\u2019t learn about their deaths until it was too late. Or that the omission was more purposeful, a judgment call of an editor who didn\u2019t deem the death newsworthy.\n\nRegardless, I now had an opportunity to give these women their due.\n\nIn November 2017, I met Jessica Bennett, The Times\u2019s first gender editor. She agreed that Overlooked was a compelling way to add to the record, and we decided to partner up.\n\nWhat followed was a whirlwind of excitement in the newsroom, with writers, editors, international correspondents, page designers, photo editors \u2014 whether they were women, men, people of color or not \u2014 asking us how they could contribute. Dozens of people have played a meaningful role in making it come together.\n\nBecause many of the subjects we wrote about died long ago, we decided to diverge from the traditional obituary style of announcing a person\u2019s death at the start of the article. Instead, we encouraged writers to be creative with their storytelling.\n\nThis series is just the beginning. I\u2019m hopeful it will inspire many more conversations inside the newsroom and beyond about diversity and what we can do to make sure no one is overlooked.\n\nIf you would like to suggest someone who has been overlooked, please fill out this form.", "keywords": ["obits", "writers", "died", "world", "born", "woman", "project", "didnt", "wondered", "editor", "tennis", "times", "overlooked", "women"], "polarity": 0.18925070028011204, "subjectivity": 0.46301353874883283},

We also do our own homework: We investigate, research and ask around before settling on our subjects.\n\nSome might think our process presumptuous. Who, after all, anointed a handful of Times editors to stand by the roadside as a parade of humanity passes and single out this one, this one \u2014 but not that one \u2014 as worthy of being remembered?\n\nThe answer is that no one did, actually, because that is not precisely what we decide. We make no judgments, moral or otherwise, about human worth. What we do try to judge, however, is newsworthiness, and that\u2019s a whole other standard.\n\nPhoto\n\nThere is no formula, scoring system or checklist. But we do hold to certain criteria, slippery as they may be. Fame, of the widespread kind, will usually get someone past the velvet ropes. Accomplishment, with wide impact, matters as much, and it often goes hand in hand with fame.\n\nBut achievement may also speak softly. Eugene Goldwasser, to name one subject among 1,195 Times obits in 2010, was a largely unsung biochemist whose 20-year pursuit of an elusive protein led to the development of a widely used anemia drug that became one of the biggest products of the biotechnology industry.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWangari Maathai was a Kenyan environmentalist who began a movement to reforest her country by paying poor women a few shillings to plant trees. She might have died in 2011 largely unknown to the wider world had she not become the first African woman to win a Nobel Peace Prize seven years before.\n\nSometimes we choose a subject in part to represent a group whose contributions were forgotten or ignored. Violet Cowden, who also died in 2011, comes to mind: She helped ferry supplies for American troops in World War II as a member of the stateside Women Airforce Service Pilots.\n\nFor every person we decide to write about there are innumerable others we decide against. Fame and accomplishment are relative; the public eye is easily distracted, and only a moment or two in its fickle gaze may not be enough to merit a backward look in The Times.\n\nThe same might be said of a sparkling r\u00e9sum\u00e9. The best schools, a successful corporate climb, charitable good works and distinguished service awards are impressive and laudable, but not necessarily newsworthy to a global audience.\n\nOne thing to remember is that it is not our intent to honor the dead; we leave the tributes to the eulogists. We seek only to report deaths and to sum up lives, illuminating why, in our judgment, those lives were significant. The justification for the obituary is in the story it tells.\n\nMany readers legitimately ask: Why are the vast majority of our obituary subjects white men? The answer lies in our not-so-distant history.\n\nUnlike the rest of the newsroom, the obituaries desk covers the past, not the present. Our pages mirror the world of 1975 or 1965 or 1955, or even earlier: They\u2019re a rearview mirror, reflecting the world as it was, not as it is, and not as we might wish it to have been.\n\nAnd so we are, inevitably, a generation or three behind in tracking the evolution of gender and racial dynamics, among other things. The prominent shapers of society back then, those who held (and didn\u2019t easily give up) the levers of power, were disproportionately white and male, be they former United States senators or business titans or Hollywood directors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith Overlooked, our new collection of obituaries for women and others who never got them, The Times is acknowledging that many worthy subjects were skipped for generations, for whatever reasons.\n\nConscious or unconscious bias? Could be. Perhaps my predecessors and I were never informed of the deaths. Maybe those who knew the deceased did not think we\u2019d be interested. Maybe an editor passed for lack of interest, or maybe considered an obit but did not have a reporter available to write it. (A practical reality that bedevils us today.)\n\nPerhaps the significance of an individual portrayed in Overlooked was not fully recognized until decades after her death. Or perhaps the paper\u2019s selection standards in eras past unfairly valued the achievements of the white, male mainstream over those of minorities and women who may have been more on the margins.\n\nI\u2019d like to think that those portrayed in Overlooked would be prime candidates for an obit in The Times today \u2014 precisely because they fit a broader standard of significance and impact and, by the way, offer compelling stories.\n\nSo why not more women and people of color on the obituary pages? (Why, for that matter, not more openly gay people, or transgender people?)\n\nThe larger answer: Because relatively few of them were allowed to make such a mark on society in their own time. Universities may have barred them. Businesses and political parties may have shut them out. The tables of power were crowded with white men; there were few seats for anyone else.\n\nThere were, of course, women who crashed glass ceilings, blacks and Native Americans and people of Asian heritage who pushed through \u201cwhites only\u201d barriers. And their stories have been told in the obituary pages over many decades.\n\nNo doubt, we\u2019ll see more of them in the years to come. As time goes on, I imagine that their stories will be increasingly framed not by broken barriers but simply by what they built, unencumbered by the dead weights of discrimination.", "keywords": ["maybe", "world", "death", "pages", "past", "white", "obituaries", "think", "women", "desk", "times", "overlooked", "obituary", "men"], "polarity": 0.10482996385058244, "subjectivity": 0.431367429821038},

Sarah Laskow of The Atlantic explained in 2014 that philosophers at this time were, in the words of the sociologist Karl Mannheim, \u201canxious to find a general law to express the rhythm of historical development, based on the biological law of the limited lifetimes of man.\u201d /But understanding societal phenomena through the lens of groups of people born around the same time has always had its limits.\n\nFor example, it\u2019s true that for young men coming-of-age during the Vietnam War, being born in a particular year (and, thanks to the draft lottery, on a particular day) could be life-shaping. But even here, an individual\u2019s class was a factor in whether he actually went to war \u2014 men from privileged backgrounds had many options to avoid the draft, the burden of which fell mainly on the working class.\n\nLike war service, entering the labor market at a time of recession, as most millennials did, can be difficult. But race and class are more important in affecting how this experience plays out for individuals.\n\nTake white millennial college graduates: Yes, they\u2019re part of an age cohort that has experienced worse economic conditions than graduates of the preceding generation \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t give us a particularly meaningful understanding of their plight, given that they are still better off when it comes to income than the average non-college-educated worker of any age.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome may argue that the generation game, if intellectually vacuous, is basically harmless. But dividing society by generation obscures the real and enduring lines of race, class and gender. When, for example, baby boomers are blamed for \u201cruining America,\u201d the argument lumps together Donald Trump and a 60-year-old black woman who works for minimum wage cleaning one of his hotels.\n\nThe pattern of inherited privilege points to yet another reality that the generation game ignores: the decline of social mobility between generations and the rise of what the French economist Thomas Piketty has called a \u201cpatrimonial society.\u201d When it comes to wealth and its accompanying privileges, the wealth of the previous generation of one\u2019s own family matter more than whether your birth year falls on one or other side of some arbitrary boundary.\n\nToday\u2019s young people may choose political action aimed at reversing these trends or to let them continue and accelerate.

Many Germans and Swedes now recognize \u2014 and some celebrate \u2014 the fact that their fellow citizens can have any skin color or religion. But the attempt to turn countries with monoethnic identities into truly multiethnic nations is a historically unique experiment, and so it should hardly come as a surprise that it has encountered some fierce resistance.\n\nThe situation in Canada and the United States, despite their histories as countries of immigration, has important similarities to that in Europe. Both have historically had rigid racial hierarchies. And in recent decades, both have made real steps toward overcoming these injustices: African-Americans, for example, are better represented in business and government than at any previous point in American history. This has made opposition to a more equal, multiethnic society more fervid among those who feel their privileges threatened. There is a sizable number of Americans for whom the idea of the nation remains synonymous with whiteness and Christianity.\n\nSo long as nationalism is associated with one particular ethnic or religious group, it will serve to exclude and disadvantage others. The only way to keep the destructive potential of nationalism in check is to fight for a society in which collective identity transcends ethnic and religious boundaries \u2014 one in which citizens from all religious or ethnic backgrounds are treated with the same respect as citizens from the majority group.\n\nTo effect this transformation is one of the great political challenges of our age. It requires principled resistance to right-wing nationalism, but it can succeed only if those who are most open to diversity abandon their hostility to other forms of nationalism.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nOne common reaction to the dangerous excesses of nationalism has been to forgo the need for any form of collective identity, exhorting people to transcend tribal allegiances completely. But for better or probably worse, it\u2019s easier to be moved by the suffering of people with whom we have some form of kinship. That is why nationalism remains one of the most powerful vehicles for expanding our circle of sympathy.\n\nAnother common reaction to the resurgence of nationalism has been to celebrate more narrow forms of collective identity, such as race or religion. At a time when many minority groups are under attack, it is, of course, crucial to defend them against discrimination. But it is also important to remember that such groups, too, are capable of oppressing their own members, for example by enforcing restrictive moral codes. That\u2019s why the only way to allow individuals true freedom to lead their lives is to preserve some form of political identity independent of the interests of particular cultural groups.\n\nConvinced that they would be unable to redirect nationalism toward their own ends, many of the most open-minded segments of society long ago gave up on the fight to determine its meaning. In countries like Germany and the United States, advocacy for the victims of prejudice has increasingly bled into a belief that the dark chapters of those countries\u2019 history make any form of nationalism deeply suspect. Instead of exhorting their fellow citizens to live up to their nations\u2019 highest ideals, many activists seem content with denouncing past and present injustices. This has allowed the bigots and racists to bend the meaning of the nation to their own sinister ends.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s time to fight back. Nationalism can, and should, be reclaimed for liberals.\n\nA few political leaders have made a valiant start. Barack Obama has been an especially persuasive advocate of the idea that Americans should focus on what unites rather than what divides us and that the symbolism of the nation can inspire hope, even as we reckon with the injustices of American history. \u201cWhat greater expression of faith in the American experiment than this,\u201d Mr. Obama marveled as he stood on the spot in Selma, Ala. where civil rights protesters were beaten in 1965. \u201cWhat greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished, that we are strong enough to be self-critical, that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is in our power to remake this nation to more closely align with our highest ideals?\u201d\n\nCampaigning for France\u2019s presidency last year, Emmanuel Macron expressed inclusive patriotism in an even more explicit form. \u201cI see Armenians, Italians, Algerians, Moroccans, Tunisians,\u201d he said at a rally in Marseille, a diverse city in southern France, \u201cBut what do I see? I see the people of Marseille! What do I see? I see the people of France!\u201d This, he added in an explicit repudiation of the exclusive nationalism propagated by the far-right National Front party, \u201cis what it means to be proud to be French!\u201d\n\nAmerican \u2014 and to a lesser degree European \u2014 political culture is pregnant with the symbols of inclusive patriotism. But while we have plenty of history to build on, we must also recognize that we are fighting to establish a kind of society for which there is no clear precedent.\n\nIn the United States, the model had once been a melting pot. But asking individuals to conform to one unified culture puts the price of admission to the nation too high. In Canada, the model is often said to be that of a salad bowl, in which the overall dish is enriched by the great variety of individual ingredients. But we can now see that this may be an overly idealized image of a society in which people feel that they have little in common across ethnic and religious divides.\n\nThere may not be a perfect culinary metaphor for the kind of country inclusive nationalists seek to create. But its contours should be obvious. It is a state in which all members have the same rights and opportunities irrespective of the group into which they are born or the culture to which they belong. It is a society in which people feel that they have something important in common because they seek to govern themselves together, pledge to help one another in an hour of need and recognize that these shared commitments are ultimately more consequential than any difference of color or creed. And it is a culture that does not shy away from celebrating the nobility of this collective identity \u2014 embracing the nation\u2019s flag not because we claim never to have failed our compatriots in the past but because we aspire to realize a common future fair to all.\n\nIt would be tempting to say that this kind of patriotism has little in common with the nationalism that is now ascendant around the world. Patriotism, some philosophers argue, should be understood as an innocent love of country that is inclusive at home and cooperative abroad. Nationalism, by contrast, excludes other ethnicities and stands in competition with the interests of other countries.\n\nBut it is too clever by half to pretend that we can safely stoke the good aspects of patriotism without ever running the danger of exacerbating the worst aspects of nationalism. For the kind of patriotism I am proposing is not a completely different form of collective identity; it is, rather, one that proudly stands in competition with the exclusionary politics on display from Washington to Moscow to Beijing.\n\nNationalism is like a half-wild beast. As long as it remains under our control, it can be of tremendous use. But if we abandon it, others are sure to step in, prodding and baiting the beast to bring out its most ferocious side. For all the well-founded misgivings about it, we have little choice but to domesticate it as best we can.", "keywords": ["identity", "common", "liberals", "religious", "society", "form", "reclaim", "nationalism", "patriotism", "nation", "collective", "political"], "polarity": 0.14129125602529854, "subjectivity": 0.47932204517310895},

But I know now that they\u2019re linked for another reason: Hollywood\u2019s systemic demonization of Arabs, Persians and Muslims in general has made it much easier for Washington, the media and the public to start and support wars with no end in sight.

{"title": "\n                    New Y.A. Books by Women of Color Rewrite Old Cultural Scripts                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/books/review/ya-women-of-color-clayton-adeyemi.html", "text": "Now, more than anytime in recent history, we\u2019re hearing the triumphant roar of women of color as they break down longstanding barriers in art, film and literature. In young adult literature in particular, inventive, international stories told in newly empowered women\u2019s voices are claiming their rightful place at the table. Take these five new Y.A. books, ranging from fantasy to realistic fiction to memoir. In these authors\u2019 hands, non-Western sensibilities might reign in a vivid and original Yoruban religion-based world, or classical settings might be reinterpreted to create a universe in which beauty is not tied to race. A heartbreaking fictional front row seat to the Syrian refugee emergency is offset by a humorous true tale of growing up an Iranian-American immigrant without a green card. And a very modern romance proves that, despite divides both cultural and digital, love still wins. So do Y.A. readers, when it comes to seeing exhilaratingly new kinds of characters sharing space.\n\nIn Dhonielle Clayton\u2019s lavish fantasy THE BELLES (Freeform, $17.99; ages 14 to 17), a thing of beauty is only temporary. The decadent island society of Orl\u00e9ans is home to a select group of sisters born with the disconcerting ability to perform plastic surgery without the plastic. As \u201cdescendants of the goddess of beauty,\u201d the Belles have a fuzzily explained magical \u201carcana\u201d in their blood that allows them to temporarily change the physical appearance of the native Gris, who are cursed with gray skin and red eyes. After a childhood of training, the teenage Belles are introduced to upper-class society and tasked with transforming the hair, skin and bone structure of the race-fluid rich and royal. But when the rebellious Belle Camellia uncovers a plot by the truly vile Princess Sophia to enslave her and her sisters, she sows the seeds of a grass-roots revolution that is bound to blossom more fully in the inevitable sequel.\n\nPhoto\n\nClayton, a co-founder of the We Need Diverse Books organization, has created an opulent mash-up setting, which seems to be a cherry-picked combination of 18th-century France, Japan and the antebellum American South. If it never quite coalesces into a seamless cultural whole, readers seduced by the page-turning palace intrigue and the vivid food and clothing descriptions won\u2019t notice or care.\n\nMagic also lies dormant in the platelets of chosen teenagers in the Nigerian-American Tomi Adeyemi\u2019s debut, CHILDREN OF BLOOD AND BONE (Holt, $18.99; ages 12 and up). But these diviners are no debutantes. Born with snow white hair and deep brown skin in the imaginary country of Or\u00efsha, young diviners morph into mighty, magic-wielding maji, or magicians, at 13. For centuries they relied on their powers (which Adeyemi based on aspects of the religion of the Yoruban people of West Africa). All that ended when the nonmagical King Saran ordered the slaughter of all adult majis. But when a mysterious scroll falls into the hands of Amari, a defiant princess, and Z\u00e9lie, a tenacious diviner warrior, the two young women set out on a thrilling, death-defying journey to restore magic and take back the throne.\n\nPhoto\n\nBlack Girl Magic, indeed! It\u2019s no surprise that this epic trilogy opener has already been optioned for film. Full of cinematic action sequences (the most memorable of them set almost entirely underwater and employing an army of the dead) and creatures worthy of Star Wars (horse-size \u201clionaires\u201d have saber teeth and horns), it storms the boundaries of the imagination. Yet it also confronts the conscience. Adeyemi\u2019s brutally depicted war between the noble, lighter-skinned kosidans and the enslaved, darker-skinned majis poses thought-provoking questions about race, class and authority that hold up a warning mirror to our sharply divided society.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Tareq is a Syrian refugee whose perilous journey is narrated by the voice of Destiny, characterized as a kindly, prosaic entity. After Tareq\u2019s mother, grandmother and four of his siblings are killed by a bomb, he and his father flee to Turkey with his remaining sister, Susan. They hopscotch from Turkey to Greece, Serbia, Slovenia, Austria and finally to Germany, where he finds a fragile safety. Along the way he witnesses beheadings and drownings, but also experiences the kindness of aid workers like Alexia, an American student. Abawi, a foreign news correspondent, does an admirable job of showing the grim horror of refugee life. But her efforts are occasionally undermined by cartoonish villains (\u201cYou tink you will be saved? Who will save you? Captain America is not real, just movies\u201d) and by some of Destiny\u2019s well-meaning but obvious platitudes: \u201cWhen you truly love someone, their life means more to you than your own.\u201d These interruptions may pull readers out of the story, though perhaps that distance is necessary for adolescents trying to process something as bleak and overwhelming as the Syrian refugee crisis.\n\nPhoto\n\nOf course, once refugees finally arrive in their adopted country, new problems arise. Until she was 13, Sara Saedi, an Iranian-American television writer and the author of the memoir AMERICANIZED: Rebel Without a Green Card (Random House, $17.99, ages 12 and up), was cheerfully oblivious of her family\u2019s immigration status. After her older sister breaks the news that they are \u201cillegal,\u201d Saedi suffers through the usual teenage rites of passage at her Silicon Valley high school (unibrow management, pimple wars, pot smoking) with the added pressure of possible deportation hanging over her head. Saedi adroitly and humorously uses these universal pubescent ordeals to contextualize Iranian culture and the immigrant experience. A memory of being teased about her eyebrow in ninth grade expands into a discussion of beauty norms: When her mother praises her for being hairless, \u201cshe meant by Persian woman standards. I was still hairy by everyone else\u2019s standards.\u201d And she has the sobering realization that pot is a privilege American teenagers can enjoy, but not undocumented kids: \u201cIf I got caught, I\u2019d have a criminal record that could be grounds for deportation.\u201d Very funny but never flippant, Saedi mixes \u201990s pop culture references, adolescent angst and Iranian history into an intimate, informative narrative that thoroughly defies current divisive views on immigration.\n\nPhoto\n\nMary H.K. Choi\u2019s blushingly tender and piquant debut novel, EMERGENCY CONTACT (Simon & Schuster, $17.99; ages 14 and up), about two isolated, misfit college students from Austin who fall in love via text message explores our emotional rather than geographical divides. In \u201cEmergency Contact,\u201d a Korean-American would-be writer named Penny keeps everyone at a distance, the result of living with a single, oversharing mom she calls \u201cthe equivalent of \u2026 human glitter.\u201d But when she rescues Sam, a half-German, half-Polish student filmmaker, from the sidewalk during a panic attack, she becomes his \u201cemergency contact,\u201d and he hers. Their charged, initial banter on text soon develops into increasingly personal exchanges about art, death, unstable moms and pregnant ex-girlfriends. Yet their burgeoning bond keeps stalling out. Burned by past relationships and millennial-ly tethered to their devices, they struggle to connect romantically IRL. Sam \u201ccouldn\u2019t imagine the space Penny would take up in his life if she sprang out of his phone,\u201d and Penny admits \u201cSam was her phone and her phone was Sam.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nChoi, a culture correspondent for HBO\u2019s Vice News, inserts timely issues like sexual assault, cultural appropriation and even DACA into her characters\u2019 intimate conversations, but it is her examination of digital vs. F2F communication that feels the most immediate. Has digital communication become so ubiquitous, and interpersonal contact so arduous, that we\u2019d rather type than talk? Thankfully, no.

She takes comfort from local efforts like a project in Utica, N.Y., where Bosnian Muslim immigrants and local Unitarian Christians watched a Super Bowl together. She applauds aggressive racial integration programs like those run by the American military. She cites her own teaching experience in small seminars at Yale, where students from divergent backgrounds overcame disagreements to achieve mutual respect, sometimes even friendship.\n\nPhoto\n\nYet the scholar in Chua acknowledges that these individual experiences offer less of a social lesson than she would wish.\n\n\u201cStudies show that minimal or superficial exposure to out-group members can actually worsen group division. \u2026 Negative interactions with people from other groups also increase group hostility. So merely putting members of different groups in the same space is not enough and indeed can aggravate political tribalism.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Chua falls back on the very attitude to which she turned her sharply skeptical gaze at the beginning of the book: the conviction that the United States was, is and will remain an exceptional nation, different from all the others. In her introduction, Chua remarked that the United States as a supertribal entity indifferent to ethnicity and culture became at best a partial reality only a generation ago. By book\u2019s end, however, the battered ideal has been polished and refurbished.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Will we, telling ourselves \u2018These immigrants are different,\u2019 be the weak link, the first generation to fail? Will we forget who we are?\u201d That\u2019s inspiring, and even more so are the citations of Martin Luther King Jr., Lin-Manuel Miranda and Langston Hughes that finish the book.\n\nInspiring \u2014 but not wholly reassuring. A lot of the interest of \u201cPolitical Tribes\u201d comes from the strong sense it emanates of an author arguing with herself. Chua both condemns tribalism and respects its power. She insists that the United States alone of nations among the earth has often transcended it \u2014 and then presents impressive contrary evidence from the past and the present. Chua reckons with the many tribalisms of the American past: ethnic, religious and racial. She hopes for a future in which tribalism fades \u2014 even as she mercilessly details its accumulating strength.\n\nAs Chua notes, tribes can coalesce out of previously unrelated pieces. Immigrants to Europe from North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia \u2014 of different languages, ethnicities, folkways and religious practices \u2014 raised children who created for themselves a new identity as post-ethnic Muslims. ISIS, as Chua mordantly observes, is in its own way a melting pot, bringing together young men and women from across Europe, Asia and the Americas to fight for a new ideology. She quotes a New York Times article about young British girls lured to ISIS. For them, \u201cIslam is punk rock.\u201d\n\nTribes can be created by fission as well as by fusion. Chua suggests that in the United States, divisions that would once have been understood as class divides have been reinterpreted in our time as cultural, even when they are not ethnic. \u201cWhite Americans often hold their biggest disdain for other white Americans \u2014 the ones on the opposite side of the cultural divide.\u201d\n\nThese fast-evolving and ever-changing identities may look contingent from the outside. They feel overwhelmingly powerful to those inside. Chua repeatedly scolds American policymakers for underestimating the importance of ethnocultural identity in Vietnam in the 1960s, Venezuela in the 1990s and Afghanistan in the 2000s. Through her book pulses an evident worry that tribal claims are now overpowering national ones within the United States. If she cannot quite bring herself to make her own anxieties explicit \u2014 or figure out what if anything to do to address them \u2014 she is hardly alone.

Otto Kerner of Illinois.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson had established the commission to examine the disorders and violent protests in Detroit, Newark and well over 100 other American cities during the summer of 1967, and earlier. What it found was searing. \u201cWhat white Americans have never fully understood \u2013 but what the Negro can never forget \u2013 is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto,\u201d the commission concluded. \u201cWhite institutions created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it.\u201d\n\nMostly moderate and mostly white men, the members of the bipartisan panel carried the imprimatur of the political establishment. Their recommendations attracted widespread public debate.

Today, the top 1 percent receive 52 percent of all new income. Rich people are healthier and live longer. They get a better education, which produces greater gains in income.

I\u2019d love to jump right in and hear your aspirations for Prairie View. What do you hope to accomplish in your time as president? I assume you had many offers to lead other colleges. Why was Prairie View different?\n\nRuth Simmons: Well, I\u2019m a native of Texas, and one of the things that I did when I returned to Houston after I retired from Brown was think about the ways I could use my experience to help the community. I started with small ventures in the city, but I hadn\u2019t thought really that another university would be in my life. But when I was approached by Prairie View, I thought immediately about its significant impact on my brother, who went there. And what Dillard did for me.\n\nI grew up in a segregated neighborhood in Grapeland, Tex., with very little experience with the world. The transition that Dillard enabled for me was extremely valuable. As an undergraduate, I began to grow a sense of confidence that helped me move from a fairly insular environment to a bigger stage when I went to graduate school.\n\nMy aspirations for Prairie View are to essentially make sure the university is continuing to do the same thing for students today that it did for my brother \u2014 and Dillard did for me. And that is to offer the advantage of a strong education that will prepare students for the careers they want, in a social and cultural context that helps them develop the confidence to perform after graduation.\n\nAs president, that means focusing on time-honored strategies to success that apply to universities everywhere: worrying about the faculty who are recruited here, the campus experience, and whether we are providing the leadership and internship opportunities that students need. It means worrying about the reputation of the university. It\u2019s obviously a much more competitive world today than it was when I was a student, but the underlying work to move the university to a level of achievement that makes students and alumni proud is the same.\n\nM.J.: What do you see as some of the major challenges facing historically black colleges and universities?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: The general challenge for H.B.C.U.s is not unlike the problem many universities face today, and that is the financial model. Being tuition dependent has become a large problem for all universities. H.B.C.U.s are dependent on raising money, but that is a reality that most universities obviously face. So it very much depends on the question of whether the schools have a good-enough foundation because of secure financing. When it comes to the federal government\u2019s role in supporting H.B.C.U.s, I think we don\u2019t yet understand the extent to which they will be affected by the changes in Washington today. To say that many are not hopeful in this moment is an understatement. We just don\u2019t know.\n\nFrankly, that\u2019s why I advocate for developing enough financial independence to secure the future of our institutions. That means looking for different revenue streams, looking to increase our ability to raise funds and finding alternate programs that help to bring more income into our university. The only strategy cannot be to persistently raise tuition, making college outside the reach of many families.\n\nM.J.: You\u2019ve led several institutions that are all very different from each other, and the topic of leadership is something you\u2019ve talked a lot about. In another interview with The Times you said that it\u2019s much easier to lead people \u201cif you convey the underlying principles.\u201d Can you elaborate?\n\nR.S.: One thing that I\u2019ve learned is that the perceptions of what it takes to be a leader are often based on prototypical models that don\u2019t have much truth in reality. People look at the institutions that I have led and they see dissimilarities. I see similarities. When people think in terms of leadership, they\u2019re often thinking about the kind of specific skills needed for different types of enterprises. I think of leadership as more of a disposition \u2014 the ability to step into a situation to learn about the history of the enterprise, the opportunities that it faces, the culture that exists and the people who are served by it. To look at all of that, to listen to stakeholders and then to think about how that enterprise or institution should best be served. There is no one model of leadership if you approach it that way. What I have tried to do wherever I go is to start where the institution is rather than try to import particularly rigid constructs from other places. In that sense, I think a leader is more than anything else a facilitator. A person who is able to come in to show a community a picture of what it is, to provide some insight into what it could be \u2014 how it could be different or improved perhaps \u2014 and then enlist the help of people who are there and others who support that institution in order to move forward together.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nI don\u2019t subscribe to the model of hero leadership, which is identifying somebody who can come in and have magical powers and then wield the wand and fix things that have not been fixable before. I don\u2019t see that. I think leadership is a community affair.\n\nM.J.: That makes sense. So how do you approach educating the current generation of students at Prairie View to lead in the way you described?\n\nR.S.: People today are fond of leadership programs that theorize about the profile and tenets of leadership. And students anxiously get involved in those programs. I rather think that our entire campuses are incubators of leadership even without the formality of such programs because if we\u2019re doing what we should be doing, we are acclimating students to an environment in which they have to learn to work with others who are very different from themselves. And that seems to me to be the first requirement of leadership. To actually learn to work with people in a respectful and inclusive way is inordinately important. A campus provides one of the best opportunities for people to be able to do that because you sit in class alongside people whom you initially don\u2019t know. You are discussing your ideas, having people respond to them and often rejecting what you\u2019re saying. You are joining organizations that have certain aims that are being advanced by the collective, so you\u2019re learning how to facilitate. You are asked to step into leadership roles either through student government or organizations. Even in the classroom context you might play a leadership role. You have to learn to express yourself, to be convincing, to write out your ideas, to be more thoughtful than you\u2019d ordinarily be. All of those things are components of leadership.\n\nM.J.: Some would argue that social media, or perhaps disagreements over the concept of safe spaces, have made it more challenging for people to come together and to work together.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: Yeah, I would say that people frequently say that, but that has certainly not been my experience. I would say that in my days as a student, the tensions were higher, the disagreements were greater, the separation among us was certainly more pronounced. And people are kind of inventing a new narrative, that things are so much worse today than they were in the past. I don\u2019t buy that. I think we have new terminology, because the modern sciences of psychology and sociology and so forth and modern media have enabled us to peer into areas that we were not able to see as easily as before. And so when you have social media and all of the ways in which people can now say whatever they want to say \u2014 in an unartful or offensive way \u2014 that turns the volume up to be sure. But it doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t there before.\n\nI would say that the current situation ought to give us much more practice in how to engage with each other because it is not underground. It\u2019s out front, it\u2019s in the open. The media today and the things that are being reported should be upsetting or troubling to students, my goodness. But it may be an even better opportunity to engage students.\n\nAs a teacher, as an educator, I would say these times are especially fertile for teaching the skills that are needed in a world in which there are many types of people, many perspectives and so forth. Students don\u2019t need to feel silenced by the current situation. When students at Brown came to me and said, you know, they were hurt because somebody asked them about their hair, and they were tired of that and they didn\u2019t want any part of it, I would say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s just too bad!\u201d Somebody asked you about your hair, tell them about your hair. You are in college not to hide from that. You\u2019re there to teach the world about yourself, you\u2019re there to learn about others and to teach them about who you are. So I\u2019d rather think this whole notion of protecting people from that is something that we have to take in hand and deal with. And help students see the opportunity in that because if they engage with people who have those kinds of perspectives, they are going to be much stronger in the end than if they run away.\n\nM.J.: Do you see the situation differently for students at H.B.C.U.s? You mentioned that Dillard gave you the space to learn and build confidence before heading to graduate school.\n\nR.S.: There is a narrative that many people have for H.B.C.U.s. People see them as a monolith, or only see them as filling a gap that exists for African-Americans. H.B.C.U.s are not a brand. They are institutions with a certain history \u2014 they were originally set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for education \u2014 but they are not all alike, and are very diverse in what they offer.\n\nPrairie View, for example, is the second-oldest public institution of higher education in the state of Texas. It was set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for ex-slaves and whites. For a long time it provided educational opportunities for black students that wouldn\u2019t have been open to them otherwise. In nursing, architecture, engineering and other STEM fields at a time when many blacks were not able to go into those areas, the university was able to facilitate the entry of blacks into those professions.\n\nM.J.: Yes, this is something that Nikole Hannah-Jones has written about for The New York Times Magazine, in particular how Xavier University of Louisiana sends more black students to medical school than almost any other college in the country. I read that Prairie View has many more students who graduate with degrees in architecture and engineering.\n\nR.S.: Yes, going to Dillard is not like going to Prairie View. So the student who chooses to go to one H.B.C.U. may not find another appealing. That has to do with the unique features of the place, the academic culture and so on, the traditions. All of that makes a big difference.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen I went off to college, I was just trying to find a place where I could be a student without impediments that in that day and time were fairly widely known to be substantial if you enrolled in a majority-white institution. There was no question that in 1963, if you went off to college in the South, you had to be very careful about where you studied. The racial dynamic was very challenging at that time. One of the things I\u2019m learning now is that many of the students I speak to at Prairie View today have the same kinds of thoughts that I had those many years ago. They ask themselves, where can I feel comfortable so that I don\u2019t have to worry about anything but my academic work? So certainly that plays a factor in why students apply to H.B.C.U.s. And for some H.B.C.U.s, applications are way up. But if you reach the point where you think that a category of institutions are the right choice for you \u2014 going to an H.B.C.U. just to go to an H.B.C.U. \u2014 then you\u2019re not thinking broadly enough.\n\nM.J.: As you look across the landscape of higher education, what other challenges do college students face today?\n\nR.S.: I guess I worry a lot about our students having the skills and the experience to promote respectful interactions with a wide-ranging group of people. Students can be quite passionate about what they see on the national scene and how sometimes dangerous they think it is \u2014 how unpleasant it is and so forth. But we\u2019ve got to try to find a way on our campuses not to taint the national picture as hopeless, or as being antithetical to anything that we can think of as good and admirable. The last thing we want is for our students to bow out and decide that it isn\u2019t worth trying to do anything about a hopeless situation.\n\nAnd I do think that civility goes hand in hand with being hopeful. Hopeful that the next person you meet you will be able to converse with you in a respectful way. Hopeful that the next election cycle is going to give you a chance to be engaged and able to do something that makes you feel a sense of your own agency. Hopeful that the things will get better rather than worse.\n\nSo much of what we have to do on our campuses is really to hold open the possibility for people that civil society will in the end right itself \u2014 if enough of us are engaged. I am so thankful every day for the fact that I grew up in a time when nobody thought blacks would be able to be integrated into American society, they would never be able to hold important positions, they\u2019d never be respected intellectually, they\u2019d never be able to do the things that they are now able to do. So why did we persist? And why did we continue to work toward betterment? We did it because we had people working with us in education who were ever hopeful that things were going to change. So I like to say to educators, you have to be always projecting to students that civility enables hopefulness to be ever resurgent.", "keywords": ["leadership", "say", "dont", "cultivating", "able", "students", "simmons", "prairie", "today", "view", "think", "college", "ruth", "generation", "things"], "polarity": 0.18839701321015756, "subjectivity": 0.47766767453623127},

They are quiet, almost too much so. But once you learn what happened in these scenes from small towns, big cities or verdant fields, their almost unemotional first impression gives way to horror: Someone was lynched there.\n\nStarting in 2016, Mr. Clasper traveled through the United States seeking the sites of lynchings. He wanted to show how places that call no attention to themselves were the sites of hangings, slashings or execution by gunfire. In the course of covering 24 sites, they span 150 years, right up to the present century, and range from the American south to New York City.\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective, I take it back to 1903, when the American scholar and activist W.E.B. Du Bois said the problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line,\u201d Mr. Clasper said. \u201cIt seems to me not a lot has changed despite significant advances. There has been barely a year or generation that has passed where racism and violence have not been at the forefront of the American experience.\u201d\n\nAs the London-born son of a British mother and American father, Mr. Clasper said he had \u201ca deep spiritual connection to the American landscape.\u201d In this series \u2014 titled \u201cThe Spaces We Inherit\u201d \u2014 he hopes to gently confront viewers in a way that eschews graphic images of violence.\n\n\u201cI took a different approach and focused on the spaces to encourage people to look at this history from an altered perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve become desensitized to images of violence. But everything that happen s has to happen somewhere.\u201d\n\nGiven the persisting tensions over racial and religious prejudice, Mr. Clasper wants to gently provoke a necessary conversation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to investigate these deep-seated issues in America,\u201d he said. \u201cI think many agree that the nation has not dealt with its bloody past of lynchings and segregation. It seemed to me there has been no collective acceptance, let alone recognition of the mistakes made and the sins committed.\u201d\n\nInterviews were conducted by Oliver Clasper and have been edited for brevity.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Jesse Lee Bond, Arlington, Tenn., 1939\n\nOn April 28, 1939, a local sharecropper named Jesse Lee Bond was shot to death in broad daylight by employees of SY Wilson, a local hardware store. Jesse Lee Bond had asked for an invoice the day before after purchasing goods on credit, something that was no\u0095t done by African-Americans at that time as keeping sharecroppers in the dark about how much they had spent was one way for white owners to keep their workers in constant debt. The day of Jesse Lee Bond\u2019s murder he was ordered back to the store. His aunt accompanied him and witnessed the whole thing. \u201cThey shot at him and shot him. He ran out to the outhouse. They riddled the outhouse. And when he staggered out of the outhouse, they threw him down, castrated him, and dragged him to the river,\u0095\u201d she said. The family was told he had drowned accidentally.\n\nImage\n\nSylvester Lewis, Memphis\n\n\u201cI remember my cousin Jesse well. I was 9 when he was killed and he was 20. What I heard was that there had been a dispute at the SY Wilson general store over in Arlington. Jesse insisted on a receipt, but this is something they didn\u2019\u0095t do. I think whoever he was negotiating with relented, but I think the people over him, the father of the individual in question, didn\u2019\u0095t like it. They went to his home and said they wanted to talk to him and ordered him back to the store. When he returned they attacked him. He tried to run for his life but they caught up with him and shot him. I also heard that they dragged his body behind a vehicle and then dumped him in the river. The descendants are running the store now, and I\u2019\u0095m not sure they know what happened. The ones who were allegedly involved in the lynching passed a long time ago, but their relations are still in Arlington. I don\u2019t think there\u2019\u0095s any resentment now. Anyone who hears about it can\u2019\u0095t understand how that could happen. They simply can\u2019t relate to that kind of criminal activity.\u201d\n\nInterviewed November 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Emmett Till, Drew, Miss., 1955.\n\nIn what is one of the most significant race-related events in the history of the United States, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Chicago native, was brutally lynched in rural Mississippi on Aug. 28, 1955. Till, who had been visiting family members in the area, entered a local white-owned grocery store in the town of Money for less than one minute. Whatever was said between him and the proprietor, Carolyn Bryant, was used as the pretext for his murder. Four days later Till was abducted from his uncle\u2019\u0095s house by Roy Bryant, Carolyn\u2019\u0095s husband, and J.W. Milam and driven to a nearby barn where he was severely beaten and tortured (the original wall of the barn can be seen on the left of the photograph). He was then taken to the Tallahatchie River, shot in the head, and drowned with a cotton gin fan tied around his neck. In an infamous court case both defendants were found \u0094not guilty\u0095 by an all-white jury. Months later they sold their story and admitted their guilt, with Bryant claiming that the Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education that desegregated schools was a mistake. Emmett Till\u2019s mother, Mamie Till Bradley, allowed photos to be taken of her son\u2019s broken and swollen body because she \u201cwanted the world to see what they did to my baby.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nDr. Jeffrey Andrews, Drew, Miss.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know the history of the property when I purchased it in 2003 and it was only two years later that a few local people told me of the Emmett Till murder. I\u2019ve lived in Drew since I was 12 and I had never heard of it. I\u2019ve since modified the barn to make it more functional and useful, and someone once asked me why I would change a historical site, but history is in the past and people should move on. Things have changed drastically here in the Mississippi Delta region and race relations are at all-time high. History is an important learning tool and it should be used to help people move forward, but one thing you have to remember is that people here don\u2019t want to be constantly reminded of how things were 60 years ago. We\u2019ve all moved forward, and sometimes people aren\u2019t given enough credit for the changes we\u2019ve made. I respect everyone\u2019s feelings towards Emmett Till, and I\u2019ve met some of his family members. They\u2019re great people. This has been a learning experience for my family and we appreciate the fact that we\u2019re part of a historical site.\u201d\n\nInterviewed March 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Joe Coe, Omaha, 1891\n\nOn Oct. 10, 1891, a 50-year-old African-American named Joe Coe (also known as George Smith) was accused of sexually assaulting a 5-year-old girl and was quickly arrested. Rumors spread that the girl had died and that Coe would get off lightly, neither of which was true. A frenzied mob seized him from the jail at the Douglas County Courthouse, put a rope around his neck, and dragged his body through the streets. Coe was then hanged from a streetcar wire on the corner of 17th and Harney in front of thousands of onlookers. Souvenirs of the rope were later sold. Mayor Richard C. Cushing of Omaha condemned the lynching as \u201c\u0094the most deplorable thing that has ever happened in the history of the country.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Ell Persons, Memphis, 1917\n\nWhen the decapitated body of a 16-year-old local, Antoinette Rappel, was found near the old Wolf River Bridge in May 1917, Ell Persons, a local black woodcutter, was deemed a possible suspect. Despite being arrested and released twice, he was captured a third time and forced to confess. A local mob announced that he was to be lynched the next day. The news spread, and a crowd of 3,000 turned up to witness his lynching (including students of Central High School). Ell Persons was burned on a makeshift pyre in a carnival-like atmosphere. He was then decapitated, and his head was taken to the predominantly African-American Beale Street and thrown at locals. A century later his lynching was commemorated and a historic marker was erected near the site.\n\nImage\n\nAmal Altareb, Memphis\n\n\u201cI came to America in 2012 from Yemen. I\u2019m still learning the language and the history, and it wasn\u2019t until the spring of last year that I learned about lynchings. I knew some of the history of segregation and Jim Crow laws, and I knew how unfair the system was \u2014 that African-Americans weren\u2019t treated as equals \u2014 but I didn\u2019t know that human beings had been burned or hanged from a tree just because of their race. Last year my class at Central High School were discussing it and I asked what lynchings were and they were surprised that I didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s surprising that humans can go so far as to kill someone else in this way and create a festival-like atmosphere. There were even spectators. Uncovering the truth is painful, but it\u2019s important. The African-American students especially don\u2019t talk about it because it\u2019s painful, and it reminds them of the injustices towards their race. White Americans don\u2019t want to remember either because of the guilt they feel. I can understand why people want to avoid the topic, but we need to face history in order to move forward.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Leo Frank, Marietta, Ga., 1915\n\nMary Phagan, 13, was found dead on April 26, 1913, at a National Pencil Company factory where she worked. Amid an atmosphere of anti-Semitism and despite conflicting evidence, a Jewish superintendent named Leo Frank was convicted of the crime. Frank\u2019s sentence was later commuted from the death penalty to life imprisonment, a decision that led a mob on Aug. 17, 1915, to seize him from state prison and lynch him from a tree in Marietta, Mary Phagan\u2019s hometown. Later that year the second chapter of the Ku Klux Klan was founded on Stone Mountain, with a number of Leo Frank\u2019s murderers present. Leo Frank was posthumously pardoned in 1986.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of George W. Murray, Mae Murray Dorsey, Roger Malcom and Dorothy Malcolm, Walton County, Georgia, 1946\n\nAfter Roger Malcom, a World War II veteran and Georgia sharecropper, had been bailed out of jail after allegedly stabbing a white man, members of the local community decided to take revenge. On July 25, 1946, a mob of 15 to 20 stopped the car Malcom was riding in with his wife, Dorothy, and another couple, George W. Murray and Mae Murray Dorsey, who was pregnant. They tied the four of them to a nearby tree and shot them to death. Mae Murray Dorsey then had her unborn baby ripped out of her. Despite an F.B.I. investigation nobody was brought to trial for the crime, and a few months later a grand jury was \u201cunable to establish the identity of any persons guilty of violating the civil rights statute of the United States.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nCeleste Butler, Omaha\n\n\u201cTracing one\u2019s roots and one\u2019s history is hard, especially as an African-American. These are big questions we all want to know: Who are we and where do we come from? I had DNA testing done recently but it didn\u2019t lead anywhere. It just told me that my ancestors came from West Africa, but it couldn\u2019t say where exactly. Missing that part and not being able to hand it down to my children or grandchildren is frustrating. On top of that you hear some people in this country telling black people to \u2018go back home.\u2019 Home to what? Home to whom? It feels like a total assault both mentally and physically to have chapters and generations missing. Not being able to fill that void is difficult. When it comes to racial violence I feel like we\u2019re constantly suffering from PTSD. It\u2019s a stress that never really goes away. A lot of people suffer in pain and in silence, and they suffer for successive generations. Everything was stripped from us, and we\u2019ve been struggling to put the pieces back together ever since.\u201d\n\nInterviewed September 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Michael Donald, Mobile, Ala., 1981\n\nMichael Donald, 19, was abducted on March 21, 1981, by Henry Hays and James Knowles as he was walking home. They beat him, slit his throat, and hanged his body from a tree outside 114 Herndon Avenue. The pretext for Donald\u2019s murder was a \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict handed down by a partially black jury to an African-American man accused of killing a white police officer. This incensed the Alabama chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, led by Benny Jack Hays, the father of Henry Hays, who suggested killing a random black person in response. Michael Donald\u2019s mother, Beulah Mae Donald, with the help of the Southern Poverty Law Center, brought a case not just against the killers but also the United Klans of America. Beulah Mae Donald won the case and received $7 million in damages, essentially bankrupting the U.K.A. Henry Hays was executed, while Knowles received life imprisonment. Hays is the only known Klan member to have been executed in the 20th century for the murder of an African-American. Herndon Avenue has since been renamed Michael Donald Avenue and a historic marker has been erected.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Mulugeta Seraw, Portland, Ore., 1988\n\nOn the evening of Nov. 13, 1988, an Ethiopian student named Mulugeta Seraw was being dropped off at his apartment when he was attacked by Kenneth Mieske, Kyle Brewster and Steve Strasser, members of a local racist skinhead group called East Side White Pride. Mieske delivered the fatal blows with a baseball bat. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 1990 Seraw\u2019s family, represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, brought a civil lawsuit against the killers\u2019 affiliated group, the White Aryan Nation, and its leaders, Tom and John Metzger, for $12.5 million. Tom Metzger later said that the killers had done their \u201ccivic duty\u201d by killing Seraw.\n\nImage\n\nJason Downard, Portland, Ore.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 2 I was put into foster care, and in 2009 I went to prison for a gang-affiliated drive-by shooting. I didn\u2019t grow up racist, but in prison the racist skinheads pulled me into their group and drilled stuff into my head about how the media is run by Jews and that they wanted an all-white nation. I also got a tattoo of a swastika on my leg, which I\u2019ve since had covered up. It\u2019s a painful reminder. The skinheads showed me support and love and compassion, which I hadn\u2019t experienced before in my life; everyone is looking for some kind of acceptance. I was angry and uncomfortable with who I was, and I drove that anger towards people who didn\u2019t look like me. In the last two years of the movement my sister had a son with a black guy and my nephew would give me this look like he knew what I was about. I started to get a guilty conscience and began to think about the things I thought I believed in. My sister said I\u2019d been brainwashed, and I can see why. The movement just taught me to hate and reinforced those views. The problem of racism in this country is much deeper than many people think. When it comes to Trump, he\u2019s tacitly endorsed the alt-right and white supremacists. It\u2019s been a ripple effect and things have gotten worse since he came into power. The right now feel emboldened. I look back now at some of the things I\u2019ve done and I realize that I\u2019ve hurt a lot of people. I decided I wanted to help others who had been in a similar position to me, and that\u2019s been my mission ever since. Now I work for an organization called Life After Hate. I\u2019m a marked man, and maybe I\u2019ll die doing this, but at least I\u2019ll die knowing I did the right thing.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Murder Site of Timothy Caughman, New York City, 2017\n\nOn March 17, 2017 James Harris Jackson traveled from his home in Baltimore to New York City with the intention of killing random black men. The reason, he later told police, was his hatred of interracial relationships. Three days later he found Timothy Caughman, 66, collecting cans in a trash bin on the corner of West 36th and 9th Avenue and stabbed him multiple times with an 18-inch sword. Caughman died of his injuries that night, and two days later Jackson turned himself in, telling police that he had planned to kill more black men in Times Square. On March 27, Jackson was charged with one count each of murder in the first and second degrees as an act of terrorism, second-degree murder as a hate crime, and three counts of criminal possession of a weapon.\n\n\u201cThe Spaces We Inherit,\u201d which will be published as a book by Overlapse in October 2018, is available for pre-order.\n\nFollow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

Though his inquiry is intensely, at times painfully personal, Mr. Wilkerson is above all concerned with unpacking the mechanisms of racial domination. The procedure is akin to performing surgery on a half-conscious subject, or digging up a buried land mine that has lost little of its explosive power.\n\nVideo\n\nThe focus of his excavation is a killing that took place in Dothan, Ala., in 1946, when S.E. Branch, a white shopkeeper, shot Bill Spann, a black man who was in his store. Branch, Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s great-grandfather, was charged with first-degree murder, but no trial was ever held, and the crime faded from memory. Or rather, the memory of it was quietly and systematically suppressed. All that remains are a short newspaper article and a few photographs and home movies of the killer.\n\n\u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d proceeds on several parallel tracks. Mr. Wilkerson returns to Alabama and tries to discover both how Bill Spann died and how he was forgotten. His investigation, accompanied by haunting images of Southern back roads and quiet houses, is punctuated by reminders that Bill Spann\u2019s death is hardly a unique or anomalous event. The names of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and other recent victims of racist violence appear onscreen, and two songs of protest loop into the soundtrack: Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s \u201cHell You Talmbout\u201d and Phil Ochs\u2019s \u201cWilliam Moore.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat song, about a white postal worker and civil rights activist murdered on an Alabama highway in 1963, is the source of the film\u2019s title and a part of its wider cultural context. \u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d is a passionately political film, aflame with rage in spite of its director\u2019s measured, ruminative tone of voice. It is also a horror movie, full of specters and silences and a terror that is pervasive, intimate and elusive.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Wilkerson, whose previous films include \u201cAn Injury to One\u201d and \u201cFar From Afghanistan,\u201d dispenses with many of the usual techniques of historical documentary. There are a few on-camera interviews, with neighbors and relatives, but more frequently Mr. Wilkerson narrates encounters that took place off camera. And his sleuthing often leads not to moments of revelation but to dead ends and deeper mysteries. The insertion of clips from \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d provides a chilling and ironic counterpoint to the grim story this movie is telling. S.E. Branch is the opposite of Gregory Peck\u2019s brave and decent Atticus Finch, and the truth about what happened to Bill Spann resists the kind of redemptive, healing conclusion that remains a cornerstone of American racial fantasy.\n\nInstead of consolation, Mr. Wilkerson offers commitment. Instead of idealism, honesty. He doesn\u2019t suppose that his film will solve anything, but there is nonetheless something profoundly useful about the way he confronts past and present manifestations of white supremacy. He links his great-grandfather\u2019s crime to the contemporaneous gang rape of Recy Taylor (the subject of an excellent recent documentary by Nancy Buirski), and uncovers patterns of abuse within his family. He corresponds with a relative who is part of a white nationalist, \u201cSouthern secessionist\u201d group. He notes the way racial injustice dwells in apparently mundane facts. The killer is immortalized in pictures and a well-kept tombstone. His victim has been almost entirely erased from memory, a kind of second death beyond the reach of redress or revenge.", "keywords": ["mr", "review", "bill", "racial", "spann", "reckons", "fired", "white", "wilkerson", "wonder", "movie", "memory", "gun", "supremacy"], "polarity": 0.04540441176470589, "subjectivity": 0.3202205882352941},

But it\u2019s more than a competitive event.\n\nImage Miguel Cruz Jr., background, with Jorge Cruz Credit G L Askew II for The New York Times\n\nThe men gather at an open field in a recreation area of the San Fernando Valley every Sunday, putting chalk to the dusty ground to draw the boundaries of a game that has been a weekly ritual as long as many can remember . After they are done, these men and others who filter in cluster into distinct teams, tossing a six-pound rubber ball to warm up.\n\nOn a recent Sunday, one of them, Jorge Cruz, 39, lifted a 15-pound glove studded with nails and other ornamentation in the air. He glanced back at his teammates and asked, \u201cYou guys ready?\u201d in Zapotec, an indigenous Oaxacan language, before bouncing the ball on a cement slab known as el saque and hitting it toward the opposing team.\n\nThis is how you start a game of pelota mixteca, a ballgame said by its players in California to have originated hundreds of years ago in Oaxaca, Mexico, though theories abound about whether it is an offshoot of an ancient Mesoamerican game or a European sport brought to the New World . Wherever it arrived, it serves not only as a pastime: It is also a way of keeping its players\u2019 culture alive, and serves as a network for an immigrant community throughout the West Coast. It has even spawned an under-the-radar international tournament.\n\n\u201cMy dad first brought me out here when I was 17, but now I come on my own and I bring my children,\u201d Jorge Cruz said, pausing during one of the games. \u201cHe would always tell me that this was one of the ways that we could preserve our culture.\u201d\n\nHe is not alone. More than two dozen other Oaxacan players who speak indigenous languages like Zapotec and Mixtec travel to the pasajuegos (games) every week from Southern and Northern California cities, and each makes the journey to the San Fernando Valley for many of the same reasons.\n\nImage Jorge Cruz, 39 Credit G L Askew Ii for The New York Times\n\nImage At first glance, pelota mixteca might resemble elements of baseball, volleyball and tennis, but a closer examination reveals a bit more nuance. Each jugada, as each individual game is called, involves approximately 10 players, and begins when one player initiates a serve from the cement slab. Credit G L Askew II for The New York Times\n\nMr. Cruz\u2019s father, Reynaldo Cruz, 71, introduced the game to his son to preserve Oaxacan culture and his family\u2019s native language. The elder Cruz speaks an Oaxacan language known as Valle (valley), as well as Zapotec, an indigenous language spoken by 400,000 people, which is recognized more frequently, according to Pamela Munro, a professor of linguistics at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nBecause a majority of the pelota mixteca players live in communities where Spanish or English are spoken rather than Zapotec, second-generation Oaxacan children are less likely to preserve that language or any of the other indigenous languages spoken during play .\n\n\u201cThey often shy away from speaking their indigenous language because of the legacy of racism, which forces them to sometimes hide and cloak their identities,\u201d said Rafael V\u00e1squez, 37, a scholar who is working on a book about Mexican ethnicity and multilingualism . \u201cWhen there\u2019s a safe space they often feel more free to speak in their native languages.\u201d\n\nMost of the men who play pelota mixteca are first-generation immigrants who were part of successive waves of Oaxacans who settled in and around Los Angeles beginning in the 1980s. Like Reynaldo Cruz, many of these people chose to live in Oaxacan communities.\n\nImage Jorge Cruz Jr., left, and Jorge Lopez Credit G L Askew II for The New York Times\n\nFor second-generation Oaxacan youths in the United States, speaking indigenous languages in school or public spaces is often met with sharp ridicule because of negative stereotypes from Mexican-Americans, the scholars said.\n\n\u201cMany Spanish speakers in Mexico are quite prejudice d against people who speak indigenous languages,\u201d Ms. Munro said. \u201cThe Spanish term indio (Indian) in Mexico is a highly prejudicial term, and a lot of that carries over to indigenous people in the U.S.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, some families believe that learning Spanish instead of their indigenous language provides more economic opportunities both in the U.S. and in Mexico, according to Mr. Vasquez.\n\nA number of Oaxacan youths are making efforts to \u201crevitalize\u201d these indigenous languages by playing sports like pelota mixteca and making frequent trips to Oaxaca. It provides an environment free from the stigma or the expectation to adopt Spanish.\n\nStill, pelota mixteca is far from a perfect game. And while most of the men are married and are doting husbands and fathers, the game reveals strong questions about the role of gender in the sport. Women are not on the field and if the men\u2019s wives attend the games, they often look after the children while their husbands play.\n\nSome of the players believe that women cannot handle the physical strain of the game, said Paula Mota, 25, a graduate student at California State University, Northridge, who has spent three years observing and researching this group of pelota mixteca players. But she added that there were some women\u2019s teams in Mexico.\n\nImage A glove and balls used in pelota mixteca. Players must order their gloves from highly sought-out artisans who live in Oaxaca, a process that can take up to a few months and cost between $200 and $300. Credit G L Askew Ii for The New York Times\n\nWhat began as a game between local Los Angeles residents almost 20 years ago has in recent years emerged as an under-the-radar international tournament, with players coming from as far as Texas and Oaxaca twice a year to play in local tournaments.\n\nOther players \u2014 particularly those who are undocumented \u2014 use the pelota mixteca social media network as a way to share helpful information for community members facing the threat of deportation, particularly when traveling to and from tournaments.\n\nNews about laws like SB-1070, a bill that passed in Arizona in 2010 that requires the police to determine the immigration status of people detained or arrested when there is \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d of their immigration status, spread throughout the pelota mixteca community and caused concern among players who hoped to travel to different states to play. At the same time, the widespread accessibility of social media has meant that it is a place where players can strategize about safe travel routes .\n\nPelota mixteca continues to be played in relative obscurity every Sunday , but a younger generation of players has appeared on the field. Mr. Cruz now brings his son Jorge, 15, and his nephew, Miguel Angel, 9, to the games with him every weekend, as his father once did more than 20 years ago.\n\nThe rally ended and the younger Jorge Cruz, walked off the field to take a break from the blazing San Fernando Valley heat. \u201cI feel empowered and excited that I\u2019m playing the same game that my ancestors did,\u201d he said while catching his breath. \u201cIf I have children one day, I\u2019m going to teach them this game, too, so that they don\u2019t lose our heritage.\u201d", "keywords": ["sport", "culture", "language", "players", "pelota", "mixteca", "oaxacan", "jorge", "york", "game", "alive", "keeping", "indigenous", "cruz"], "polarity": 0.07625170625170624, "subjectivity": 0.38048165048165056},

(We do not meet Perry or Don.) But who gets to \u201ccount\u201d as diverse is one of the play\u2019s horrible-hilarious wrangles. In an argument with Roberta, a member of Hillcrest\u2019s development staff, Sherri insists that the school\u2019s admissions catalog must depict a student body that is visually diverse \u2014 so Perry, who is light-skinned, doesn\u2019t count. To comply, Roberta (Ann McDonough) has to stage photos that feature recognizably dark-skinned students, reading \u201cThe Bluest Eye\u201d no less.\n\nPerry may not be black enough for the catalog, but Charlie certainly thinks he was black enough for Yale, and accepted for that reason. In an astonishing 17-minute howl of disappointment, he undoes a lifetime of indoctrination as he dissects the logical fallacies on which, he feels, his parents\u2019 values \u2014 and Yale\u2019s, and Hillcrest\u2019s \u2014 are based.\n\nPhoto\n\nIs Pen\u00e9lope Cruz a person of color? Is Kim Kardashian? If so, why isn\u2019t, say, Marion Cotillard? And why does Perry\u2019s mother act as if \u201cit\u2019s this huge achievement that a not totally white baby popped out of her vagina\u201d? Should white people hate white people?\n\nThe evening I saw it, this line of thought had the audience roaring and clapping and then seeming to want to retract both responses as Charlie veered into ever more uncomfortable ideas.\n\nThat\u2019s good satire at work, causing us to think critically about people we don\u2019t at first recognize as images of ourselves. And the discomfort only deepens when Charlie, stung by his parents\u2019 reaction to his tirade \u2014 his father calls him a spoiled brat \u2014 reconsiders his position and makes a startling decision.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Her assumptions of privilege, however unexamined, will not be denied. The crux of Mr. Harmon\u2019s argument, which is as tightly constructed as a finger-trap toy \u2014 almost every piece of information supplied at the start pays off by the end \u2014 is that hypocrisy may look a lot like love.\n\nSatires don\u2019t usually go there. Recent racial comedies, like Branden Jacobs-Jenkins\u2019s \u201cAn Octoroon\u201d and Bruce Norris\u2019s \u201cClybourne Park,\u201d have been built on ludicrously bad behavior, and let the results speak for themselves. \u201cAdmissions\u201d is less extreme but also, as a result, harder to put across. The characters are caught somewhere between well-observed types and absurd caricatures. Sherri\u2019s mama bear ferocity is necessary to turn the plot, just as Charlie\u2019s hysteria about Yale is, but in real life both would be subtler. Of course, in real life this plot wouldn\u2019t happen.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t happen onstage. As in his previous plays \u201cBad Jews\u201d and \u201cSignificant Other,\u201d Mr. Harmon is admirably unafraid of portraying incorrectness in the guise of sour comedy. In a way, Charlie is a combination of Daphna, the relentless scold of \u201cBad Jews,\u201d and Jordan, the whiny wallflower of \u201cSignificant Other.\u201d But \u201cAdmissions\u201d is even better for being about something substantially larger than one character\u2019s unhappiness.\n\nStill, I\u2019m not sure that Daniel Aukin\u2019s warm and intermittently rollicking production finds the right tone. Though there are moments in which the mere placement of bodies on the Newhouse\u2019s thrust stage is enough to make you anxious, there are too many others that seem to pull back from the blinding clarity that\u2019s needed. (Mark Barton\u2019s lighting is way too gentle.) When the actors, generally working in a naturalistic vein, tear into their characters\u2019 most unhinged moments they seem to be grinding gears. You find yourself questioning the likelihood of their behavior when, ideally, you would be too breathless to study it.\n\nNo matter.

Image A winter storm in Erie blanketed the McBride Viaduct in snow. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\nERIE, Pa. \u2014 Despite the \u201cRoad Closed\u201d barriers blocking cars and trucks, Elizabeth Feliciano trudged the other morning on foot across the McBride Viaduct, late for school. Arching over a gritty scrap-metal yard and railway line, the graffiti-scrawled 1,170-foot-long bridge links two of this city\u2019s poorest neighborhoods.\n\nImage\n\nWhen the viaduct opened in the late 1930s, the city was growing. The bridge, renovated in the 1970s, was an emblem of local pride and progress. It funneled traffic through what were at the time thriving neighborhoods.\n\nThen the factories started disappearing. The viaduct\u2019s largely German, Polish and Irish district became home to increasing numbers of blacks, Latinos and refugees from Africa and the Middle East, whose arrivals have slowed the city\u2019s population decline.\n\nOn one level, the story of the bridge is a microcosm of America\u2019s crumbling infrastructure. Questions about where to spend the city\u2019s limited resources touch on familiar themes about the failures of urban renewal and today\u2019s widening income gap.\n\nAt the same time, the debate over the fate of a decaying relic of midcentury industrial architecture has focused a particular spotlight on Erie\u2019s legacy of disenfranchisement and its troubled race relations.\n\nImage Mary Whalen prayed before the noon Mass at St. Anne's Church just north of the viaduct. The viaduct is named for a former pastor of the church, Msgr. Lawrence McBride, who campaigned for its construction after a child was killed crossing the tracks. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\nThe legacy lives on: Erie was recently ranked the worst city in the country for African-Americans. Using national census data, the news organization 24/7 Wall Street found that 47 percent of the city\u2019s black population lives at or below the national poverty line, twice the rate for African-Americans nationally and more than four times the rate for whites in Erie.\n\nAfter the ranking was published in November, The Erie Times-News took issue with some of the survey\u2019s numbers, but not the gist. Median income for black residents in the city languishes at around half that of white residents; the unemployment rate is more than triple the national average.\n\nAnd City Hall is perceived by many black residents as an enclave of white privilege.\n\n\u201cThis city spends a huge amount to pay for police to incarcerate people from our community,\u201d said Cee Williams, a former Erie County poet laureate. There are only eight minority police officers of the 173 officers employed by the city.\n\n\u201cHow about spending some of that money on fixing the bridge,\u201d Mr. Williams said, suggesting that such an approach \u201cmight help change the lives of kids who end up costing the public a fortune in prison.\u201d\n\nImage Police officers responded to a domestic disturbance call at a home in the lower east side of Erie, during a winter storm that caused widespread power failures. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\nThe bridge, a picturesque ruin riddled with potholes, is today a victim of this region\u2019s harsh weather and an unspoken City Hall policy of demolition by neglect. Lately, students from Gannon University, on the other side of Erie, have adopted it as a hangout and cause \u2014 a miniature untapped version of New York\u2019s repurposed rail tracks known as the High Line. Local teenagers use it as a de facto elevated park, for lack of green space.\n\nMore than a few, like Ms. Feliciano, walk or bike across it because, as she said, \u201cit\u2019s still the safest, shortest route\u201d over the tracks. It is better, they contend, than the pedestrian path, with its dangerous street crossing, along a busy expressway that the city built a block away.\n\nOne city block may not seem far. But to those who have to walk it, it can seem like another unfair burden that some in the community have been forced to bear. Unlike the expressway, the viaduct \u201cgoes where we want to go,\u201d Ms. Feliciano said.\n\nLandscape architects have a poetic term for this. They call it a desire line.\n\nStill, Erie officials are poised to tear the bridge down, insisting the cost of its repair and maintenance is simply prohibitive. They say only a clique of preservationists really cares about saving the viaduct, noting that residents from the neighborhood rarely showed up at public meetings over the years to support it.\n\nImage Taquanta Gray and Noel Remigio at home with their daughter, Nivea, 2, and dog, Blue. Ms. Gray said she used the bridge regularly to visit her parents and extended family. The loss of the bridge would mean a longer, more perilous commute for the family, she said. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\n\u201cThe reason black people weren\u2019t showing up at public meetings to talk about the viaduct is that they have lost hope,\u201d said Shantel Hilliard, longtime executive director of the Booker T. Washington Center. \u201cWhy bother when things here never change?\u201d\n\nAlso called the East Avenue Bridge, the viaduct opened in 1938. A Catholic pastor in the neighborhood, Msgr. Lawrence McBride of St. Ann\u2019s Church, campaigned for the bridge after a child was killed trying to cross the tracks.\n\nFor decades, the span fed thousands of pedestrians, cars and trucks onto East Avenue, the area\u2019s main street. But it was shut to traffic almost eight years ago, after officials had poured some $180 million into the expressway over the tracks, called the Bayfront Connector, which was completed in 2005. The Bayfront Connector was, in essence, an old-fashioned traffic engineer\u2019s vision of urban renewal, with all the predictable results.\n\nThe expressway sped suburbanites in their cars in and out of Erie. But it cleaved a struggling inner-city district, cutting off homes from schools, devastating East Avenue businesses, turning neighborhood streets into dead ends and deflating already-low housing values, while encouraging crime on some of those dead-end streets.\n\nThe city\u2019s new mayor, Joe Schember, had barely moved into City Hall in January before announcing his determination to tear the old bridge down \u201cas quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nMr. Schember, a Democrat, acknowledged the expressway\u2019s ill consequences, and even brought up that damning report about Erie and its black population.\n\nImage Kamarion Barney, 13, walked home from school over the McBride Viaduct. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\nBut after consulting some of the same city and state engineers who devised the connector, he concluded that the McBride bridge was no longer safe or needed, and that it might cost some $6 million to fix, more than he believes this straitened city can afford.\n\nPreservationists angrily reject the mayor\u2019s figures, conjecturing a far lower cost to keep the bridge open just for pedestrians and bikes. They point to a new $5 increase in vehicle registration fees that promises Erie an additional $1.4 million a year for infrastructure improvements, a fund that could help pay to fix the bridge.\n\n\u201cWe have serious problems on the east side,\u201d Mr. Schember said. \u201cIf the city is going to put money to work there, there are much more worthwhile things to spend it on than the viaduct.\u201d\n\nHe has yet to spell those things out. In place of the viaduct, the city has been contemplating larger parking lots.\n\nFor East Side residents \u2014 many of whom cannot afford cars and who often take their lives into their hands dashing on foot across the multilane expressway, scrambling over its concrete Jersey barriers to get home or to the neighborhood Walmart \u2014 the viaduct remains not just a way to get where they are going. It is a measure of where the city is headed.\n\nImage From left, Traivyon Spencer, 3, Kiahra Moffett, 11, and Shalee Spencer, 12, hopped over several concrete barricades to cross the Bayfront Connector on their way home after school. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t equity mean that if you subtract something, you need to add something in return?\u201d said the Rev. Anthony Harris, who oversees the largely black congregation at Shiloh Baptist Church, near the viaduct.\n\nMayor Schember has lately promised new, safer pedestrian crossings along the connector and improvements to the expressway\u2019s pedestrian path over the tracks. With funds having already been allocated for the viaduct\u2019s demolition, he said, acting expeditiously on the low bid by an out-of-town firm called Swank may throw off \u201cadditional resources\u201d for \u201cbeautifying that area, for which we will seek resident input,\u201d he said.\n\nThe mayor has in the meantime endorsed Erie Refocused, a comprehensive plan he inherited from the previous administration that was never carried out. Among other things, it calls for improved community engagement, public spaces and streets geared more toward pedestrians and bikes.\n\nThese are precisely the arguments for fixing the viaduct, preservationists say.\n\nImage A gate where people can gain access and cross the train tracks through the grounds of scrap yards and industrial businesses. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\nTheir opponents include R. Jason Wieczorek, an architect in the Erie office of Bostwick Design Partnership. His grandfather was a second-generation Polish-American who settled on the east side and worked for General Electric, where Mr. Wieczorek\u2019s father also worked, before the company drastically downsized.\n\nMr. Wieczorek has two young children, lives on the West Side, and endorses the idea of investing in downtown and along the waterfront, to attract more businesses and tourists, not in what he called \u201cfailing neighborhoods\u201d on the east side.\n\n\u201cI cannot find the type of housing, with neighbors I would want to live with, on the east side,\u201d Mr. Wieczorek added. \u201cWe need to prepare people to move out of those neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nHe recalled Richard Florida, the urbanist who years ago theorized about city cores radiating prosperity by cultivating a \u201ccreative class.\u201d When asked about Erie, Mr. Florida said that his thinking \u201chas evolved\u201d in light of increasing urban inequity.\n\n\u201cThe creative class can\u2019t mean only recruiting artists and people who work for tech companies,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has to include cultivating talent from within \u2014 immigrants, refugees, African-American communities.\u201d\n\nAt a raucous City Council meeting in February, advocates for the bridge loudly pleaded with the mayor while he stuck to his prepared remarks about tearing it down.\n\n\u201cWe have students who walk miles every day, through the snow because they don\u2019t own cars,\u201d said Gary Horton, who directs the Erie chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. and the E.F. Smith Quality of Life Learning Center on the city\u2019s East Side, where new immigrants learn English. \u201cThe viaduct doesn\u2019t seem important to people in City Hall. But for people looking to get ahead, it is not a side issue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about hope.\u201d\n\nImage Shawn Moffett, 24, made his way home from work as a snowstorm blanketed the viaduct.

And there are concerns that the recent absorption of more than a million immigrants, many from the Middle East and many Muslim, has inadvertently created incubators of a different kind of anti-Semitism \u2014 one hiding behind the injustices of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but often reverting to hateful old stereotypes, too.\n\nIt was the sight of Arab immigrants, including Palestinian-Germans like herself, burning an Israeli flag underneath the Brandenburg Gate in December while chanting \u201cDeath to Israel\u201d that moved Ms. Chebli to speak up.\n\nSince then, other disturbing stories have emerged in the German news media: an Afghan boy greeting his teacher with \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d and proclaiming that he, too, was Aryan. A group of Syrian refugees calling the Holocaust \u201ca Jewish conspiracy,\u201d explaining that they had learned that in school back home.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe reaction in Berlin, where there are strict legal prohibitions of Holocaust denial and Nazi propaganda, has been swift. The government announced that it was appointing its first-ever anti-Semitism coordinator. Some in Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservative party have urged the immediate deportation of anti-Semitic Muslims.\n\nG\u00fcnter Morsch, the director of the Sachsenhausen memorial, says he does not think that is helpful. \u201cWe cannot allow this debate to create another form of racism,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat about the Germans who are anti-Semitic?\u201d\n\nNine in 10 anti-Semitic hate crimes reported in Berlin are committed by German citizens. And for all the seeming contradictions, there is a common denominator between Muslims who espouse anti-Semitic views and those on the far-right (who also hate Muslims), Mr. Morsch said.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cAnti-Semitism correlates more closely with educational background than with ethnic background,\u201d he said, citing empirical studies.\n\nMs. Chebli says that visiting a concentration camp is no panacea, but that it can help. She visited one as a young woman. The experience changed her, she said.\n\n\u201cIt is a powerful way of keeping memory alive and giving meaning to our mantra of \u2018never again,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Chebli said. \u201cBut we need to get back to the essence of what this is about: It\u2019s about standing up for human rights and the rights of minorities \u2014 all minorities.\u201d\n\nMuslims, too\n\nDuring their visit to Sachsenhausen, the teenagers huddled around their guide in the vast triangular courtyard of the camp, its perimeter still dotted with watchtowers.\n\nSachsenhausen was no death camp, although tens of thousands of inmates are believed to have died here; those were built by the Nazis outside Germany. But it was the nerve center of two dozen major concentration camps run by the Nazis.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrom an inconspicuous office building in one corner of the camp, civil servants decided what kind of medical experiments would be conducted, how many executions would take place and how much Zyklon B gas would be delivered to the gas chambers in Auschwitz. \u201cDesk perpetrators,\u201d the guide, Mariana Aegerter, calls them.\n\n\u201cDoes anyone here know who was imprisoned here?\u201d she asked the class.\n\nNelson, a boy with shoulder-length hair, tentatively raised his hand. \u201cJews?\u201d\n\nThere were Jewish prisoners in Sachsenhausen. But unlike in the death camps, they were a minority. Of more than 200,000 inmates over the years, some 40,000 were Jewish. Many died here.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Nazi regime targeted many, Ms. Aegerter explained, like communists, clerics, homosexuals, Roma and the disabled. But also those considered \u201cantisocial\u201d: The homeless, the jobless, those on social welfare, and boys with long hair \u2014 Ms. Aegerter\u2019s eyes lingered on Nelson \u2014 or with too many girlfriends, or with a weakness for American music, like Jazz or swing.\n\nBy the time Sachsenhausen was liberated, she said, nine in 10 prisoners were foreigners, coming from 45 countries. There were Muslims, too.\n\n\u201cMuslims, too?\u201d Ferdous said later. \u201cI did not know that.\u201d\n\nBuilding bridges\n\nMs. Aegerter, a young historian, says her central aim during tours of the camp is to bring to life what is an empty space, to make students visualize life there, and ultimately to create a bridge between the visitor and the prisoner, between the present and the past.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Once, a Palestinian schoolgirl asked Ms. Aegerter, \u201cDon\u2019t you think that what the Jews are doing with the Palestinians today is the same as what the Nazis did with the Jews?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNo, she had explained, but that did not mean one had to approve of everything the state of Israel was doing. The girl seemed unconvinced.\n\nMs. Chebli comes across this all the time, she said. \u201cI have Palestinians tell me: I had to leave my country because of the Holocaust and you want me to worry about anti-Semitism?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nShe recounted the lukewarm reaction of one young man to her concerns about growing anti-Semitism. Born and raised in Germany, he does not see himself as German because, he says, Germans do not see him as German.\n\n\u201cOf course, anti-Semitism is important,\u201d he had told her, \u201cbut what about the racism I experience every day?\u201d\n\nTo win over young Muslims for the fight against anti-Semitism, Ms. Chebli said, Germany has to fight Islamophobia, too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much easier for me to persuade a young Muslim of the relevance of the Holocaust if I acknowledge their own experience of discrimination and create that link,\u201d Ms. Chebli said.\n\nSometimes, creating a link with young Germans is just as tricky, Ms. Aegerter points out.\n\nNow 34, she grew up in the eastern state of Brandenburg in the 1990s. Swastikas were a common sight in her town: Scrawled on the inside of toilet cubicles. Graffitied onto walls. A boy in her class had tattooed one on his shin. It was only after she and some friends had complained that the boy had been asked to wear long trousers during sports lessons.\n\nThese days, Ms. Aegerter has teachers on the phone who share their concerns about far-right tendencies among their students.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne teacher told her before a class visit that he had planned the trip specifically because he worried about three boys drifting into neo-Nazi territory. But on the day, all three called in sick.\n\n\u201cSadly, that is no exception,\u201d Ms. Aegerter said.\n\nIn some cases, she said, it is the parents telling teachers they do not want their children to visit a concentration camp.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen students do come, it can be transformative, said Mr. Morsch, who has been director of the memorial for 25 years.\n\n\u201cIt would be na\u00efve to expect a two-hour tour to turn neo-Nazis into anti-fascists,\u201d Mr. Morsch said. \u201cBut give us a little time, and we can achieve a lot.\u201d\n\nHe recalled a recent group of students from a vocational school that had a persistent problem with neo-Nazi graffiti. They spent several weeks in Sachsenhausen renovating one part of the memorial \u2014 but also working in small groups, dissecting drawings and letters of prisoners and creating their own exhibition.\n\n\u201cAfter they spend some time with us, the problem went away,\u201d Mr. Morsch said.\n\nMr. Morsch still believes that camp visits should remain voluntary. He fears an obligation to come would take away from the learning experience.\n\nMr. Hetzelein disagrees. Whether schools or the law make the call, students rarely get a say. He grew up in Bavaria, the only German state where visiting a Nazi memorial is already required.\n\nAs a high school student, he went to Dachau, near Munich. Years later, he saw Auschwitz, the Nazi death camp in what is Poland today.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe cast-iron gates, the barbed wire and the sheer scale of it still haunt him. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to read books about it,\u201d he said, \u201cyou need to feel it.\u201d\n\nA week after visiting Sachsenhausen, Mr. Hetzelein asked his students whether they thought their children should one day be made to visit a camp.\n\nOf 22 students, 21 agreed.

More than a decade ago he helped block the passage of a statewide needle-exchange program aimed at curbing the spread of H.I.V. from contaminated hypodermic needles, pitting himself against his own party.\n\nHis position on cannabis legalization not only puts him at odds with the governor and members of his party, but also with many African-Americans.\n\nIn New Jersey, African-Americans are three times more likely to be charged with marijuana possession than whites, even though both populations use the drug at similar rates. That has galvanized civil rights groups like the N.A.A.C.P. and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey to support legalization.\n\n\u201cAll the collateral consequences that come with an arrest \u2014 jail time, losing your job, losing your housing \u2014 are disproportionately falling on communities of color,\u201d said Dianna Houenou, a lawyer with the A.C.L.U. of New Jersey. \u201cThrough legalization we can begin to address the harms that have been inflicted.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA statewide coalition of black pastors, the N.A.A.C.P. and the New Jersey chapter of the Drug Policy Alliance is pushing for legalization as a social justice issue, but only if it is linked to some type of compensation for the harm they say was done to black and brown families whose sons were incarcerated. The pastors said they wanted to make sure members of their communities were able to participate in the billion-dollar cannabis industry as growers and sellers, not just workers. They are frustrated that the wealth being generated in the other states where marijuana is legal is not reaching people of color.\n\nResearchers at Marijuana Business Daily, an industry news site based in Denver, found that 81 percent of cannabis business owners were white, while less than 4 percent were black.\n\nMarijuana and racism have long been intertwined, dating back to the post-Prohibition era in the 1930s when the country\u2019s first drug czar gained traction for his war on marijuana by invoking a fear of black people. In the 1970s, President Richard Nixon\u2019s war on drugs targeted black people, as well as hippies.\n\n\u201cPoliticians and government officials used cannabis prohibition to target and criminalize black and brown people and throw them in jail,\u201d said Loretta Winters, president of the Gloucester County chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. \u201cWe demand that a huge piece of the business that this legislation will generate should make up for all the pain, suffering and loss of revenue that our black and brown communities have been subjected to.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAt a marijuana legalization forum held recently at Bethany Baptist Church in Newark, the Rev. Charles Boyer of Bethel A.M.E.

But it does not include any language discussing compensation.\n\nMr. Scutari agrees that arrests for marijuana possession are disproportionately higher for blacks and Latinos and says his bill addresses the issue of social justice.\n\n\u201cThe individuals that are previously convicted of marijuana possession will no longer be subject to prosecution,\u201d Mr. Scutari said.\n\nHe also said he was willing to consider other demands \u2014 but most likely in a separate bill. Mr. Scutari said any initial revenue from marijuana sales must first fund the state\u2019s program, including hiring staff, before paying for drug treatment, fixing the state\u2019s pension debt or building roads.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Rice has proposed his own marijuana bill that would decriminalize the possession of 10 grams or less of marijuana, and make carrying more a disorderly persons charge that would impose only a fine. It would also expunge criminal records and release incarcerated people serving sentences for possessing small amounts of marijuana. But Mr. Scutari said that decriminalization would simply create an open-air drug market that would allow drug dealers to get richer without creating any kind of regulatory system to control how marijuana is sold.\n\nUltimately, any effort to promote civil rights could depend on what kind of bill Mr. Murphy is willing to sign. In a statement, Daniel Bryan, a spokesman for the governor, said that Mr. Murphy was committed to \u201cthe goal of building a stronger and fairer New Jersey, and supports the legalization of marijuana to advance the cause of social justice and combat the racial disparities in our criminal justice system.\u201d", "keywords": ["drug", "justice", "legal", "racial", "marijuana", "mr", "cannabis", "black", "bill", "jersey", "social", "possession", "fight", "scutari", "legalization", "pot", "drives"], "polarity": 0.07900764201784606, "subjectivity": 0.4244901640309803},

Far from constituting the principal opposition to President Emmanuel Macron, a promise she made last year, her voice in the National Assembly is inaudible. The influence of the Front\u2019s few parliamentary deputies is negligible. The party has virtually disappeared as a national force.\n\nThe party congress this weekend in Lille was intended, in part, to reverse this. Ms. Le Pen has received authorization to change the National Front\u2019s name, still associated with the party\u2019s founder, her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, and his years of Holocaust denial and association with Nazi collaborators.\n\nKicked out of the party by his daughter in 2015, Mr. Le Pen called a name change \u201csuicidal\u201d in a recent interview. For the first time since the Front was founded in 1972, he is not attending the party congress.\n\nMs. Le Pen has herself expressed ambivalence about continuing in the role of party president, and some party activists interviewed here also suggested the Front\u2019s future is not inevitably tied to the woman who inherited the leadership from her father.\n\n\u201cFor now we\u2019re with Marine Le Pen.

I am 74 years old and I have seen a lot of racism in my life but \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d was the worst. It depicted a black women as a slave, who at the same time had power.

As someone adopted from China and raised in a predominantly white town, \u201cMulan\u201d was my premier exposure to Asian beauty and culture. Her story\u2019s message about turning adversity into strength sticks with me always.\n\n\u2014 MaiLei Meyers\n\nThe first time I saw gay men represented in film, who felt real and relatable, was in \u201cMy Beautiful Laundrette.\u201d Being gay isn\u2019t what the movie was about, these two characters just were, and that one was brown and the other white and working class made it even better.\n\n\u2014 Michael Ginther\n\n\u201cDrumline,\u201d featuring Nick Cannon, in 2002 and \u201cYou Got Served\u201d in 2004.

But she is not American and I\u2019m not at all a Bond woman. I grew up watching movies and I love the old Hollywood movies especially, but it makes me sad to realize that Hollywood\u2019s portrayal of Asians has been mocking or missing for most of its history.

Through some common coming-of-age feelings of loneliness and confusion, but also in better understanding the differences, I learned more about myself.\n\n\u2014 Sally Otis\n\nAlthough I am white, I am Jewish with \u201cbig\u201d hair, raised in the Bronx. I saw myself reflected in \u201cFunny Girl.\u201d With a New York City backdrop, song lyrics and Barbra Streisand\u2019s delivery, I felt for the first time, in the eyes of the larger world, at age 12, accepted.\n\n\u2014 Jill Sager\n\nImage Diahann Carroll and Sidney Poitier in \"Paris Blues.\" Credit Kino Lorber\n\nI am 70 years old and watched classic Hollywood movies on television during the 1950s and \u201960s.

He argued that biological differences and not a lack of opportunity explained the shortage of women in leadership and technical positions.\n\nGoogle fired Mr. Damore. He filed a lawsuit in January with another former employee, claiming that the company discriminates against white men with conservative views. In a separate lawsuit, a former recruiter for YouTube sued Google because, he said, he was fired for resisting a mandate to hire only diverse \u2014 female or black and Latino \u2014 candidates.\n\nGoogle\u2019s handling of the issue was also upsetting to Mr. Damore\u2019s critics. In another lawsuit filed last month, a former Google employee said he was fired because he was too outspoken in advocating diversity and for spending too much time on \u201csocial activism.\u201d\n\nInside Google, vocal diversity proponents say they are the targets of a small group of employees who are sympathetic to Mr. Damore. In some cases, screenshots of comments made on an internal social network were leaked to online forums frequented by right-wing groups, which searched for and published personal information like home addresses and phone numbers of the Google employees, they said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2015, Google started an internal program called Respect@, which includes a way for employees to anonymously report complaints of inappropriate behavior by co-workers. Some diversity supporters say other employees are taking advantage of this program to accuse them of harassment for out-of-context statements.\n\n\u201cSome people feel threatened by movements that promote diversity and inclusion. They think it means people are going to come for their jobs,\u201d said Liz Fong-Jones, a Google engineer who is a vocal supporter of diversity.\n\nMany big tech companies are struggling with the challenge of creating a more diverse work force. In 2015, Facebook adopted the so-called Rooney Rule. Originally used by the National Football League to prod teams to consider coaching prospects who are black, the rule requires managers to interview candidates from underrepresented backgrounds for open positions. But last year, Facebook\u2019s female engineers said that gender bias was still a problem and that their work received more scrutiny than men\u2019s work.\n\nEven executives tasked with promoting diversity have had difficulties. In October, Denise Young Smith, who was Apple\u2019s vice president of inclusion and diversity, came under fire when she said that there was diversity even among 12 white, blue-eyed, blond men because they had different backgrounds and experiences. She later apologized, saying she did not intend to play down the importance of a non-homogenous work force. She left Apple in December.\n\nThe tension is elevated at Google, at least in part, by its workplace culture. Google has encouraged employees to express themselves and challenge one another. It provides many communication systems for people to discuss work and nonwork related issues. Even topics considered out of bounds at other workplaces \u2014 like sharp criticism of its own products \u2014 are discussed openly and celebrated.\n\nIn January, on one of Google\u2019s 90,000 \u201cgroups\u201d \u2014 internal email lists around a discussion topic \u2014 an employee urged colleagues to donate money to help pay Mr. Damore\u2019s legal fees from his lawsuit against Google to promote \u201cviewpoint diversity,\u201d according to a person who saw the posting but is not permitted to share the information publicly.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nSome Google employees who are diversity advocates said management had not taken action against people who tried to bait them into making angry statements.\n\nLast month, Tim Chevalier, who had worked at Google as an engineer until November, sued for wrongful termination, claiming that he was fired \u201cbecause of his political statements in opposition to the discrimination, harassment and white supremacy he saw being expressed on Google\u2019s internal messaging systems.\u201d He said one employee had suggested that there was a shortage of black and Latino employees at Google because they were \u201cnot as good.\u201d\n\nMr. Chevalier said he had been fired shortly after saying that Republicans were \u201cwelcome to leave\u201d if they did not feel comfortable with Google\u2019s policies. He said he had meant that being a Republican did not exempt Google employees from following the company\u2019s code of conduct.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA Google spokeswoman said in a statement that the company encouraged lively debate. But there are limits.\n\n\u201cCreating a more diverse workplace is a big challenge and a priority we\u2019ve been working to address. Some people won\u2019t agree with our approach, and they\u2019re free to express their disagreement,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Gina Scigliano. \u201cBut some conduct and discussion in the workplace crosses a line, and we don\u2019t tolerate it. We enforce strong policies, and work with affected employees, to ensure everyone can do their work free of harassment, discrimination and bullying.\u201d\n\nIn the past, discussions about diversity in Google\u2019s online chat groups would encounter skeptical but subtle comments or questions. The debate turned openly antagonistic after Mr. Damore\u2019s memo, which was titled \u201cGoogle\u2019s Ideological Echo Chamber.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe James Damore thing brought everything to a head,\u201d said Vicki Holland, a linguist who has worked at Google for seven years. \u201cIt brought everything to the surface where everyone could see it.\u201d\n\nMr. Damore said he began to question Google\u2019s diversity policies at a weekly company meeting last March. At the meeting, Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s vice president of people operations, \u201cpointed out and shamed\u201d departments in which women accounted for less than half the staff, according to Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe two female executives \u2014 who are among the company\u2019s highest-ranking women \u2014 said Google\u2019s \u201cracial and gender preferences were not up for debate,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Mr. Damore subsequently attended a \u201cDiversity and Inclusion Summit,\u201d where it reinforced his view that Google was \u201celevating political correctness over merit\u201d with its diversity measures.\n\nMr. Damore said he had written his memo afterward in response.\n\nMs. Scigliano, the Google spokeswoman, said the company looked forward to fighting Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit in court. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said in an August blog post that he had fired Mr. Damore because his memo advanced \u201charmful gender stereotypes\u201d but that \u201cmuch of the memo is fair to debate.\u201d\n\nSome employees said they were abstaining from internal debate on sensitive issues because they worried that their comments might be misconstrued or used against them. Like the broader internet, the conversations tend to be dominated by the loudest voices, they said.\n\nGoogle\u2019s diversity advocates said they would like to see more moderation on internal forums with officials stepping in to defuse tensions before conversations get out of hand. Ms. Miller, the Coworker.org co-director, said Google employees had expressed concern about how this would affect an internal culture rooted in transparency and free expression.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s on everyone\u2019s mind is: Has the culture been inextricably damaged by this environment?\u201d she said.", "keywords": ["googles", "mr", "hard", "internal", "work", "fired", "google", "diversity", "lawsuit", "damore", "diversify", "employees", "trying"], "polarity": 0.08552789802789805, "subjectivity": 0.3460065686628187},

I also leave my door open since I believe closed doors can appear ominous and threatening.\n\nTwo of our female executives and I designed our entire space with an architect and a designer. We have both Asian and American customers, and I wanted the area to reflect the two cultures. Having lived on three continents, I had a feeling about what that might look like: bright colors to jolt people into happiness about when they arrive, and free-flowing space.\n\nImage The office contains elements of both Asian and American cultures.

I use the cricket bats on the weekends with my sons, like an American family goes outside and throws the football around.\n\nMy father\u2019s walking stick is in the corner. I was schooled in the British system of education, which has a formality that never leaves you. It means that sometimes you feel you\u2019re a stranger in a strange land.\n\nSting moved to the U.S. like I did, and when he came out with \u201cEnglishman in New York,\u201d it resonated with me, especially the lines \u201cSee me walking down Fifth Avenue, A walking cane here at my side.\u201d\n\nYou occasionally see walking sticks in English movies, and my father and other Pakistani men used them to shoo away stray dogs on the road.\n\nCloseness and discipline\n\nI hold meetings with my staff at the oval glass-topped table so that the distance between us is never more than a few feet.\n\nI also use the table as a desk, but I spend much of my time at my standing desk. I switched to it about 10 years ago after a former Royal Navy officer impressed upon me that part of his training was learning to stand watch for 10 hours at a time. I was fascinated by the idea that building discipline into humdrum activities like responding to emails is a persistent way of remaining alert all day.\n\nKeeping time\n\nEarlier in my career I worked at Citibank. The blue clock, a memento, marks the tremendous success of its revolutionary digital services platform, myCiti, which launched in 2001. It helped to boost my career and survives to this day.\n\nImage Mr. Menai\u2019s copy of \u201dThe Spectator.\" Credit Melissa Lyttle for The New York Times\n\nImage Along with favorite books and his grandfather\u2019s fountain pens, Mr. Menai keeps a note from his then 8-year-old son.

My most prized literary possession is a 300-year-old compilation of \u201cThe Spectator,\u201d a periodical that described basic social obligations during that time.\n\nFamily heirlooms\n\nWhen I was 18, I brought a mug from my college, Coe College in Iowa, to the woman in Pakistan who would become my wife. I keep it here now, along with my grandfather\u2019s fountain pens. I also have the note my then 8-year-old son Nabi wrote with one when I showed him how to fill the bladder with ink. It was humorous and I was glad to see he could write well.\n\nPieces of history\n\nWhen I was overseeing Citibank marketing for Asia, a colleague gave me a framed replica of shoes worn by Chinese women who underwent foot-binding in the 10th century to keep their feet small as a symbol of social status. The shoes remind me of how certain ersatz practices can seem perfectly normal until the march of history exposes them as absurd.\n\nIt is our job to think critically and question whether certain current practices are the foot-binding of our age.\n\nOrder Reprints | Today\u2019s Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page BU 2 of the New York edition with the headline: Bridging Cultures in Downtown Los Angeles\n\n\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["cultures", "angeles", "lyttle", "credit", "downtown", "bridges", "los", "melissa", "bank", "york", "usa", "walking", "president"], "polarity": 0.1271839623600187, "subjectivity": 0.4025149889234396},

The approach seems to be working. In February, the Young Adult Library Services Association named \u201cLighter Than My Shadow,\u201d a graphic novel by Katie Green about a young woman\u2019s battle with eating disorders, one of the top 10 \u201cgreat graphic novels for teens\u201d published in 2017. During our interview, Mr. Steward, 40, talked about his career path, diversity in comics, the challenges of the industry and more. These are edited excerpts from that conversation.\n\nHow did you get your start?\n\n\n\nI went to college at American University and graduated with a degree in international business marketing. Then I worked for my dad\u2019s company, World Wide Technology, and realized very quickly it was not for me. Over a dinner, my dad said, \u201cIf you\u2019re doing something you\u2019re passionate about, you\u2019ll never work a day in your life.\u201d That stuck with me and got my wheels turning about what I was really passionate about.\n\nWhat comics did you like as a kid?\n\nI had a Marvel encyclopedia. I didn\u2019t get access to real comic books until around the time Milestone, a comic publishing imprint that showcased African-American superheroes, came out. I remember it was cool to have characters that I could see myself in. When I discovered Comixology, a digital distributor of comics, I started reading again. My girlfriend at the time, who is now my wife, was an avid prose reader. We would be hanging by the pool, and she would read her books and I would read comics.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Digital comics were on the forefront of all that. You could do flip books and light animation and add soundscapes. Carl Reed, a co-founder of Lion Forge, was working in animation and was looking for the next thing, too. We got together with a couple of other guys and started exploring: Who are the players? What are they doing? Is the market saturated? We wanted to use digital as the litmus test for what you should print. You could tell the retailer: \u201cThis title sold well first digitally.

I remember thinking, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d It was kind of like a reflection of what someone else thinks that an African-American person is, which is different from actually having more of an authentic representation. Whatever group we are representing, we are definitely having someone of that group be a part of it.\n\nHow did you approach creating these comics and catering to the audience?\n\nI feel like for everybody to participate, you have to have representation that looks like everyone in this country. We\u2019ve been careful to make sure that it is an inclusive line of characters. Kind of like the United Colors of Benetton [laughs], but it feels natural and organic.

Image Storm Reid as Meg Murry in \u201cA Wrinkle in Time.\u201d Credit Atsushi Nishijima/Disney\n\nLast month, when I returned to Madeleine L\u2019Engle\u2019s novel \u201cA Wrinkle in Time,\u201d more than 35 years after I first read it, I was taken aback. The intricate plot was as I remembered: The gangly, genius teenager Meg Murry, her younger brother, Charles Wallace, and her friend Calvin O\u2019Keefe still travel through time and space by way of a tesseract, a fifth-dimensional phenomenon, to rescue her father from the evil IT, a disembodied brain that demands conformity from all who surround it.\n\nRather, I now was unsure about my lifelong insistence that it was my favorite book as a child. Rereading it as a 42-year-old African-American woman, I started scouring \u201cA Wrinkle in Time\u201d for that original sentence or scene of identification in which my 7-year-old eyes saw myself in that all-white setting.\n\nReaders have long hailed Meg as a heroine of science fiction, but the 1962 novel is beloved as much for its unconventional female protagonist as L\u2019Engle is for weaving together complex ideas about religion, Cold War politics and astrophysics within the genre of children\u2019s literature. And for a whole generation of white girls who grew up during the 1960s and \u201970s, the novel served as a political awakening.\n\nCatherine Hand is a producer of the new Disney adaptation of the book. After working on a made-for-television version for ABC, Ms. Hand told The New Yorker in 2004 that she discovered the book when she was 10, adding: \u201cThe engine that drives it is Meg\u2019s inner life, and it\u2019s astonishing, because here is a girl who at that moment is stronger than her father. For some of us, it planted the seeds of the women\u2019s movement.\u201d\n\nFor others, the novel\u2019s influence has only grown over time. Pamela Paul, writing in The Times on the book\u2019s 50th anniversary in 2012, opined that \u201cbookish girls tend to mark phases of their lives by periods of intense literary character identification\u201d and \u201cfor those who came of age anytime during the past half-century, the most startling transformation occurred\u201d upon reading this book. She went on, \u201cIt was under L\u2019Engle\u2019s influence that we willed ourselves to be like Meg Murry.\u201d\n\nBut for African-American girls like me, identification with Meg was not as easy. Even as we saw parts of ourselves in Meg\u2019s heroism, we also had to resist our own invisibility in a novel that was unable or unwilling to imagine any people of color as inhabitants of the many planets, including Earth, to which its characters traveled. Such racial myopia is not L\u2019Engle\u2019s alone. After much debate in the publishing industry, children\u2019s literature is more diverse today than ever before but still is far from representative. Of some 3,500 children\u2019s books received from United States publishers in 2017 by the Cooperative Children\u2019s Book Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, 116 were by black authors and 319 were about African-American characters, the center said.\n\nIn the 1980s, I had even fewer choices. So instead of seeing my full self in Meg, I ended up cherry-picking the traits to which I could relate: her bravery and intelligence, or even more rare her feelings of abandonment and anger caused by her father\u2019s absence.\n\nAyana Mathis, the African-American author of the best-selling novel \u201cThe Twelve Tribes of Hattie,\u201d had a similar disconnect with this novel even though it remains her favorite book, alongside Mildred D. Taylor\u2019s \u201cRoll of Thunder, Hear My Cry\u201d (1976).\n\n\u201cMy thoughts on the book have nothing to do with my identifying with Meg,\u201d Ms. Mathis told me in a phone interview. \u201cBut I was intellectually challenged by it in a way that few books written for my age group at the time did. It expanded me but it also scared me and not with cheap thrills, but because it asked such compelling questions about evil. IT was a brain that was frightening and instructive.\u201d\n\nIt was only when the director Ava DuVernay announced that Storm Reid would play Meg as a biracial girl in the screen adaptation that my relationship with the character started to change. Ms. Reid described Meg as \u201can African-American girl that is smart, that is beautiful and that basically realizes that she is enough.\u201d Through this awareness, the actress added, Meg \u201cjust taps into her superpowers to be able to save her dad, her brother and save the world.\u201d\n\nThis revision \u2014 alongside the film\u2019s broader multiracial cast, which includes Mindy Kaling, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Reese Witherspoon and Oprah Winfrey \u2014 not only expands the feminist reach of L\u2019Engle\u2019s original vision, but also directly challenges the overwhelming absence of girls of color as leads in Hollywood films in general, and science-fiction films in particular. As recently as 2012, controversy greeted Amandla Stenberg when she played Rue in the first \u201cHunger Games\u201d movie. Rue was a black character in the dystopian novel it was based on, but fans seemed not to realize it and complained loudly about the casting. Ms. Reid\u2019s turn as Meg, by contrast, seems to have only increased fan anticipation for the movie.\n\nMore radically, Ms. DuVernay\u2019s choice for Meg helps redefine our notions of the universal. Rather than assume children of color will seamlessly identify with Meg as we do with the book or with the young, white heroines of the \u201cHunger Games\u201d or \u201cDivergent\u201d franchise, this film gives us a different, racially inflected female future and present.\n\nAnd that changes how I now appreciate the book.\n\nIt is still my favorite from childhood, but now, rather than contort myself into Meg, I am able to see how the novel\u2019s play with time and space continues to influence me as an African-American writer. I\u2019m obsessed with how people, events and cultural objects from the past shape our understandings of race and gender in the present. \u201cA Wrinkle in Time\u201d might not ask the same questions that I do now, but it was the first novel I ever read that explored multiple time dimensions and gave me permission to imagine history as incomplete, unfolding, and a phenomenon with hopes that can be taken up by successive generations.\n\nAfter I was done with the novel this time, I put my copy on my 5-year-old daughter\u2019s bookshelf, for I am comforted by what she is now able to find in \u201cA Wrinkle in Time.\u201d Though we contemporary viewers and readers are unable to engage in interplanetary travel like Meg, Ms. DuVernay\u2019s version takes us somewhere even more substantive. By emphasizing diversity over dystopia, her film does not simply warn against the dangers of who we might become, but celebrates the vast richness of who we already are.\n\nOrder Reprints | Today\u2019s Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page AR 13 of the New York edition with the headline: Notions of the Universal, Redefined\n\n\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["book", "ms", "hard", "africanamerican", "work", "childrens", "saw", "meg", "lengles", "novel", "wrinkle", "girls", "version"], "polarity": 0.07876333288704422, "subjectivity": 0.4855357700718525},

But he has used his entire career to tell America a story about itself that it does not want to hear: that racism exists today, and is pervasive outside of the Deep South. And he has worked ceaselessly toward two intertwined, impossible goals. First, the demand for equal rights for all. The second is about securing his legacy as the Martin Luther King of the North.\n\n\u201cWhat I want it to be is I helped urbanize the King movement,\u201d Mr. Sharpton said. \u201cI was the one that could bring the King movement into the Northern, urban centers.\u201d But where Dr. King\u2019s activism led to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Mr. Sharpton\u2019s efforts haven\u2019t amounted to national reform.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Sharpton, 63, figured he\u2019d be retired by now. He thought he\u2019d keep his Sunday-morning MSNBC program, \u201cPoliticsNation,\u201d and his daily radio show, \u201cKeepin\u2019 It Real.\u201d He said he was ready to name a successor to his civil rights organization, the National Action Network, and the marching, strategizing and agitating that came with it. All that was left to do was build a civil rights museum in Harlem. But riding off into a life of punditry isn\u2019t an option with Mr. Trump in office. Mr. Sharpton said he and his allies thought they were poised to help a President Hillary Clinton pass national police reform legislation. His mission is now different, and more modest.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to preserve what you\u2019ve got done,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will not matter if he revokes the Voting Rights Act, and the Civil Rights Act of Dr. King. You need to preserve the racial profiling laws, and police reform like stop and frisk,\u201d he continued. \u201cOtherwise, it\u2019ll be a bygone era.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nNow 133 pounds, Mr. Sharpton is less than half the man he was for much of his life. A morning salad and banana serve as his only real sustenance for the day, and in my time with him, he drank nothing but green tea \u2014 not even water. His flamboyant conk is now steely gray, slicked back over his thinning crown. He\u2019s quick to joke, but he rarely laughs. He has long since replaced his sweats with bespoke suits.\n\nBut the new Al Sharpton is the same person he always was.\n\nAlfred Charles Sharpton Jr. was born in 1954 to a middle-class family who had a house in a nice neighborhood in Queens. At 4, before he even knew how to read, young Al began preaching, and often practiced at home in his mother\u2019s robe. When he was just a boy, his mother connected Al with two pastors, Bishop F.D. Washington and the Rev. Dr. Bill Jones. They called him Boy Wonder, and he toured the country preaching before he was even a teenager. In 1967, Dr. Jones introduced the young preacher to a 26-year-old civil-rights activist named Jesse Jackson. Mr. Jackson took him under his wing, and Al decided he wanted to spend his life like the men who looked after him, fighting for civil rights in the prophetic tradition of Dr. King, who was assassinated when Mr. Sharpton was 13.\n\nIn 1971, when he was 16, Mr. Sharpton founded his first civil rights organization, the National Youth Movement, with money from Bayard Rustin, the chief organizer of the 1963 March on Washington. He met James Brown, who adopted him as his godson in 1973; for most of the next decade, Mr. Sharpton was always at the singer\u2019s side. If Jesse Jackson taught Mr. Sharpton how to organize, it was James Brown who taught him how to perform.\n\n\u201cI would watch what moves and what songs excited people, and I would take notes,\u201d Mr. Sharpton told me. \u201cBecause you\u2019ve got to keep people\u2019s attention.\u201d", "keywords": ["national", "mr", "act", "king", "dr", "movement", "sharpton", "rights", "reconsidered", "al", "civil"], "polarity": 0.10926573426573427, "subjectivity": 0.386868686868687},

Credit Mike Cohen for The New York Times\n\nThe role of the chief executive has never been more complex \u2014 or more consequential.\n\nBusiness leaders today are reshaping the internet, reimagining health care, upending transportation and more. But being a chief executive is no longer just about running a company. It means taking political stands on everything from immigration to gun rights. It means weighing in on tariffs and taxes \u2014 all while balancing short-term profits with long-term goals, dealing with activist investors and attracting talented employees.\n\nIn an effort to better understand the world\u2019s top chief executives \u2014 where they\u2019re coming from and how they deal with the challenges they face \u2014 The New York Times is bringing back Corner Office.\n\nFor nearly 10 years, Corner Office featured conversations about leadership and management with some 500 senior executives. The new Corner Office will build on this foundation and also cover the big issues of the day, from climate change to artificial intelligence. We\u2019ll be talking to prominent chief executives at big companies, innovators at lesser-known start-ups and organizational leaders in philanthropy, sports and the arts.\n\nWe want you to join the conversation. Let us know whom we should interview, and what questions you want answered below. And stay tuned as we bring Corner Office to life with multimedia, how-to guides and live events.\n\nAs we considered whom to interview first, Kenneth C. Frazier, the chief executive of Merck, was right at the top of the list. Mr. Frazier has a powerful personal story and has built an exceptional career.\n\nRaised in a poor neighborhood in Philadelphia, Mr. Frazier attended Penn State University and Harvard Law School. He joined Merck in 1992, defending the company against major lawsuits while resisting calls to slash research and development budgets.\n\nLast year, Mr. Frazier made headlines as the first chief executive to resign from a presidential advisory council following Mr. Trump\u2019s equivocating response to an outburst of white nationalist violence in Charlottesville, Va. As perhaps the most prominent black chief executive in the country, his stance carried powerful symbolism.\n\nThe Times published an article last month about Mr. Frazier\u2019s decision to resign from the advisory role. This interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted at Merck\u2019s headquarters in Kenilworth, N.J.\n\nYou once said that even though your father was a janitor, you believed he could have been a C.E.O.\n\nMy father was born in the year 1900 in South Carolina, and he grew up at a time where being an African-American child in the American South was to be deprived of access to anything close to a reasonable education. He only had three years of formal education, but he was self-taught. He read two newspapers a day. He could\u2019ve done a lot of things had he been born when I was born.\n\nTell me about his father.\n\nMy grandfather on my paternal side, Richard Frazier, was born in the late 1850s, and therefore was born into slavery, but was a sharecropper in South Carolina for his entire life. And one of the great things about my grandfather was that he sent my father north before he reached the age of maturity so that he, too, wouldn\u2019t become indebted to the land.\n\nHow did your parents raise you?\n\nI had a fantastic upbringing by two parents who cared deeply about their children, but more importantly believed that anything was possible for their children, and in some ways almost brainwashed us to be successful. They believed that despite the history of this country as it related to African-Americans, that for my siblings and I, that there would be tremendous opportunity. They also instilled that it was our responsibility to take advantage of the opportunities that they did not have.\n\nWhat drew you to the study of law?\n\nI\u2019ve always admired lawyers who use their power to affect social change, and Thurgood Marshall was always a childhood hero of mine.\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard Law School, you went to work at Drinker Biddle & Reath. Why there?\n\nI chose that firm in large part because they had a reputation of doing a lot of pro bono work. When I was at the firm, I read about the need in South Africa for law professors and lawyers to come from the U.S., because black law students in South Africa were obviously during apartheid only allowed to go to second-rate law schools.\n\nI lived one whole semester in Soweto. It was completely lawless. There were no streetlights. It was a completely separated area where people were contained, because the South African government\u2019s job, as it saw it, was to separate blacks from whites.\n\nBut what I remember more than anything else was interacting with people who their entire lives had been told that they were second class, that they were inferior, and how hard it was to get particularly the men to speak up in audible tones, because they had been in many ways told that their voice was not worth listening to. In addition to trying to teach people the substantive legal issues, it was a lot about trying to instill self-confidence.\n\n\u201cThe most important role of a leader is to safeguard the heritage and values of the company.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Ken Frazier\n\nYou also represented James Willie \u201cBo\u201d Cochran, a death row inmate. What was your first impression of his case?\n\nMy first reaction was, \u201cI\u2019m much too busy to take on another piece of pro bono litigation.\u201d But there were two younger lawyers in the firm who heard about the case, and they came to me and frankly they sort of shamed me into doing it.\n\nYou eventually won his freedom. What did that mean to you?\n\nIt was the high point of my professional career. This is a man who was facing an execution date for a crime he did not commit. And what I will never forget about Bo was that he had no sense of recrimination whatsoever. He was just thankful for every day that he had as a free man. It sort of reminds me of Nelson Mandela in the sense that he was able to live his life going forward without regard to trying to even scores.\n\nOne of the things that defined your early years at Merck was the defense against lawsuits over Vioxx, a painkiller that posed heart risk and was pulled off the market. Are there lessons to be learned from the way you approached that?\n\nThe central allegation that was underneath the Vioxx litigation was that this company put profit before patient safety. That went to the core of who we are as a company, and there was no way that we could allow that story to be unchallenged. We did not want Vioxx to become a verbal shorthand, like an Enron or something of that nature, for corporate wrongdoing. The most important role of a leader is to safeguard the heritage and values of the company.\n\nHow do you balance the pressure to deliver profits to public shareholders and also to make lifesaving drugs?\n\nI actually don\u2019t see that big a conflict between meeting the needs of shareholders and meeting the needs of society.\n\nVery early on in my tenure there was a lot of pressure being put on pharmaceutical C.E.O.s to cut their research budgets. And we value R & D as a company. It\u2019s who we are. It\u2019s the core of what we do. I made the decision that I wasn\u2019t going to cut our R & D budget, and that had some short-term negative consequences in terms of share price. But by taking those actions I think we were able to show that we really did care about what we said we were about as a company.\n\nThere are lots of examples of companies that have lost their way because they\u2019ve sort of lost their soul, which is a funny word to use, but companies do have souls.\n\nLast year, after President Trump\u2019s remarks following the violence in Charlottesville, you resigned from one of his advisory councils. What happened?\n\nIn that moment the president\u2019s response was one that I felt was not in concordance with my views, and I didn\u2019t think they were in concordance with the views that we claim to hold as a country. It was my view that to not take a stand on this would be viewed as a tacit endorsement of what had happened and what was said. I think words have consequences, and I think actions have consequences. I just felt that as a matter of my own personal conscience, I could not remain.\n\nWhat did you learn from the whole experience?\n\nC.E.O.s need to be very thoughtful and sober about the positions that they take publicly. Ultimately, if you believe strongly in something, you ought to say it, and you ought to say it in a very clear way.\n\nBill Horne in Newtonville, Mass., asks...\n\n\u201cIn what ways if any has your representation of prisoners on death row influenced your decisions as C.E.O.?\u201d\n\nWhat drew me to Merck was that the company\u2019s ethos had the same feel that pro bono work has, which is that you\u2019re really committed to serving your fellow human beings. I worked for 10 years to save one person\u2019s life in the context of the death penalty. Here we can make decisions every day with the stroke of the pen that can make lots of people\u2019s lives longer and healthier.\n\nHow do you prioritize your time?\n\nThere are three things that the C.E.O. should be focused on. Number one is that sense of purpose and direction that the company needs, making sure that that\u2019s always clear and people know what we\u2019re all about. The second thing is capital allocation. We only have so many resources. Making sure that you\u2019re putting those resources where you have the greatest opportunity. And the third, which I think by far is the most important, is to make sure that you have the right people in the most important jobs inside the company.\n\nWhat advice would you give to college graduates?\n\nI think people should seek adventure in life, as opposed to just allowing their ambitions to drive where they want to end up. Lots of people say, \u201cTell me what are the steps to get from here to the C.E.O.\u2019s office.\u201d I can say honestly I never sought to be a C.E.O. But what I\u2019ve always wanted was a new challenge, what I call an adventure. Seek adventure. Seek excitement in what you do.\n\nDavid Gelles is the Corner Office columnist and a business reporter.

But it\u2019s more than a competitive event.\n\nImage Miguel Cruz Jr., background, with Jorge Cruz Credit G L Askew II for The New York Times\n\nThe men gather at an open field in a recreation area of the San Fernando Valley every Sunday, putting chalk to the dusty ground to draw the boundaries of a game that has been a weekly ritual as long as many can remember . After they are done, these men and others who filter in cluster into distinct teams, tossing a six-pound rubber ball to warm up.\n\nOn a recent Sunday, one of them, Jorge Cruz, 39, lifted a 15-pound glove studded with nails and other ornamentation in the air. He glanced back at his teammates and asked, \u201cYou guys ready?\u201d in Zapotec, an indigenous Oaxacan language, before bouncing the ball on a cement slab known as el saque and hitting it toward the opposing team.\n\nThis is how you start a game of pelota mixteca, a ballgame said by its players in California to have originated hundreds of years ago in Oaxaca, Mexico, though theories abound about whether it is an offshoot of an ancient Mesoamerican game or a European sport brought to the New World . Wherever it arrived, it serves not only as a pastime: It is also a way of keeping its players\u2019 culture alive, and serves as a network for an immigrant community throughout the West Coast. It has even spawned an under-the-radar international tournament.\n\n\u201cMy dad first brought me out here when I was 17, but now I come on my own and I bring my children,\u201d Jorge Cruz said, pausing during one of the games. \u201cHe would always tell me that this was one of the ways that we could preserve our culture.\u201d\n\nHe is not alone. More than two dozen other Oaxacan players who speak indigenous languages like Zapotec and Mixtec travel to the pasajuegos (games) every week from Southern and Northern California cities, and each makes the journey to the San Fernando Valley for many of the same reasons.\n\nImage Jorge Cruz, 39 Credit G L Askew Ii for The New York Times\n\nImage At first glance, pelota mixteca might resemble elements of baseball, volleyball and tennis, but a closer examination reveals a bit more nuance. Each jugada, as each individual game is called, involves approximately 10 players, and begins when one player initiates a serve from the cement slab. Credit G L Askew II for The New York Times\n\nMr. Cruz\u2019s father, Reynaldo Cruz, 71, introduced the game to his son to preserve Oaxacan culture and his family\u2019s native language. The elder Cruz speaks an Oaxacan language known as Valle (valley), as well as Zapotec, an indigenous language spoken by 400,000 people, which is recognized more frequently, according to Pamela Munro, a professor of linguistics at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nBecause a majority of the pelota mixteca players live in communities where Spanish or English are spoken rather than Zapotec, second-generation Oaxacan children are less likely to preserve that language or any of the other indigenous languages spoken during play .\n\n\u201cThey often shy away from speaking their indigenous language because of the legacy of racism, which forces them to sometimes hide and cloak their identities,\u201d said Rafael V\u00e1squez, 37, a scholar who is working on a book about Mexican ethnicity and multilingualism . \u201cWhen there\u2019s a safe space they often feel more free to speak in their native languages.\u201d\n\nMost of the men who play pelota mixteca are first-generation immigrants who were part of successive waves of Oaxacans who settled in and around Los Angeles beginning in the 1980s. Like Reynaldo Cruz, many of these people chose to live in Oaxacan communities.\n\nImage Jorge Cruz Jr., left, and Jorge Lopez Credit G L Askew II for The New York Times\n\nFor second-generation Oaxacan youths in the United States, speaking indigenous languages in school or public spaces is often met with sharp ridicule because of negative stereotypes from Mexican-Americans, the scholars said.\n\n\u201cMany Spanish speakers in Mexico are quite prejudice d against people who speak indigenous languages,\u201d Ms. Munro said. \u201cThe Spanish term indio (Indian) in Mexico is a highly prejudicial term, and a lot of that carries over to indigenous people in the U.S.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, some families believe that learning Spanish instead of their indigenous language provides more economic opportunities both in the U.S. and in Mexico, according to Mr. Vasquez.\n\nA number of Oaxacan youths are making efforts to \u201crevitalize\u201d these indigenous languages by playing sports like pelota mixteca and making frequent trips to Oaxaca. It provides an environment free from the stigma or the expectation to adopt Spanish.\n\nStill, pelota mixteca is far from a perfect game. And while most of the men are married and are doting husbands and fathers, the game reveals strong questions about the role of gender in the sport. Women are not on the field and if the men\u2019s wives attend the games, they often look after the children while their husbands play.\n\nSome of the players believe that women cannot handle the physical strain of the game, said Paula Mota, 25, a graduate student at California State University, Northridge, who has spent three years observing and researching this group of pelota mixteca players. But she added that there were some women\u2019s teams in Mexico.\n\nImage A glove and balls used in pelota mixteca. Players must order their gloves from highly sought-out artisans who live in Oaxaca, a process that can take up to a few months and cost between $200 and $300. Credit G L Askew Ii for The New York Times\n\nWhat began as a game between local Los Angeles residents almost 20 years ago has in recent years emerged as an under-the-radar international tournament, with players coming from as far as Texas and Oaxaca twice a year to play in local tournaments.\n\nOther players \u2014 particularly those who are undocumented \u2014 use the pelota mixteca social media network as a way to share helpful information for community members facing the threat of deportation, particularly when traveling to and from tournaments.\n\nNews about laws like SB-1070, a bill that passed in Arizona in 2010 that requires the police to determine the immigration status of people detained or arrested when there is \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d of their immigration status, spread throughout the pelota mixteca community and caused concern among players who hoped to travel to different states to play. At the same time, the widespread accessibility of social media has meant that it is a place where players can strategize about safe travel routes .\n\nPelota mixteca continues to be played in relative obscurity every Sunday , but a younger generation of players has appeared on the field. Mr. Cruz now brings his son Jorge, 15, and his nephew, Miguel Angel, 9, to the games with him every weekend, as his father once did more than 20 years ago.\n\nThe rally ended and the younger Jorge Cruz, walked off the field to take a break from the blazing San Fernando Valley heat. \u201cI feel empowered and excited that I\u2019m playing the same game that my ancestors did,\u201d he said while catching his breath. \u201cIf I have children one day, I\u2019m going to teach them this game, too, so that they don\u2019t lose our heritage.\u201d", "keywords": ["sport", "culture", "language", "players", "pelota", "mixteca", "oaxacan", "jorge", "york", "game", "alive", "keeping", "indigenous", "cruz"], "polarity": 0.07625170625170624, "subjectivity": 0.38048165048165056},

(We do not meet Perry or Don.) But who gets to \u201ccount\u201d as diverse is one of the play\u2019s horrible-hilarious wrangles. In an argument with Roberta, a member of Hillcrest\u2019s development staff, Sherri insists that the school\u2019s admissions catalog must depict a student body that is visually diverse \u2014 so Perry, who is light-skinned, doesn\u2019t count. To comply, Roberta (Ann McDonough) has to stage photos that feature recognizably dark-skinned students, reading \u201cThe Bluest Eye\u201d no less.\n\nPerry may not be black enough for the catalog, but Charlie certainly thinks he was black enough for Yale, and accepted for that reason. In an astonishing 17-minute howl of disappointment, he undoes a lifetime of indoctrination as he dissects the logical fallacies on which, he feels, his parents\u2019 values \u2014 and Yale\u2019s, and Hillcrest\u2019s \u2014 are based.\n\nPhoto\n\nIs Pen\u00e9lope Cruz a person of color?

Should white people hate white people?\n\nThe evening I saw it, this line of thought had the audience roaring and clapping and then seeming to want to retract both responses as Charlie veered into ever more uncomfortable ideas.\n\nThat\u2019s good satire at work, causing us to think critically about people we don\u2019t at first recognize as images of ourselves. And the discomfort only deepens when Charlie, stung by his parents\u2019 reaction to his tirade \u2014 his father calls him a spoiled brat \u2014 reconsiders his position and makes a startling decision.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Her assumptions of privilege, however unexamined, will not be denied. The crux of Mr. Harmon\u2019s argument, which is as tightly constructed as a finger-trap toy \u2014 almost every piece of information supplied at the start pays off by the end \u2014 is that hypocrisy may look a lot like love.\n\nSatires don\u2019t usually go there. Recent racial comedies, like Branden Jacobs-Jenkins\u2019s \u201cAn Octoroon\u201d and Bruce Norris\u2019s \u201cClybourne Park,\u201d have been built on ludicrously bad behavior, and let the results speak for themselves. \u201cAdmissions\u201d is less extreme but also, as a result, harder to put across. The characters are caught somewhere between well-observed types and absurd caricatures. Sherri\u2019s mama bear ferocity is necessary to turn the plot, just as Charlie\u2019s hysteria about Yale is, but in real life both would be subtler. Of course, in real life this plot wouldn\u2019t happen.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t happen onstage. As in his previous plays \u201cBad Jews\u201d and \u201cSignificant Other,\u201d Mr. Harmon is admirably unafraid of portraying incorrectness in the guise of sour comedy. In a way, Charlie is a combination of Daphna, the relentless scold of \u201cBad Jews,\u201d and Jordan, the whiny wallflower of \u201cSignificant Other.\u201d But \u201cAdmissions\u201d is even better for being about something substantially larger than one character\u2019s unhappiness.\n\nStill, I\u2019m not sure that Daniel Aukin\u2019s warm and intermittently rollicking production finds the right tone. Though there are moments in which the mere placement of bodies on the Newhouse\u2019s thrust stage is enough to make you anxious, there are too many others that seem to pull back from the blinding clarity that\u2019s needed. (Mark Barton\u2019s lighting is way too gentle.) When the actors, generally working in a naturalistic vein, tear into their characters\u2019 most unhinged moments they seem to be grinding gears. You find yourself questioning the likelihood of their behavior when, ideally, you would be too breathless to study it.\n\nNo matter. One of the things the theater should be doing today, and rarely does, is lancing the boil of our own self-deception. \u201cAdmissions,\u201d as that pun of a title suggests, is a kind of confessional, except that no forgiveness is offered, or deserved.", "keywords": ["skewering", "charlie", "review", "yale", "perry", "parents", "characters", "white", "reading", "diversity", "york", "pieties", "bad", "admissions"], "polarity": 0.05541869588744589, "subjectivity": 0.4884913870851372},

Image A winter storm in Erie blanketed the McBride Viaduct in snow. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\nERIE, Pa. \u2014 Despite the \u201cRoad Closed\u201d barriers blocking cars and trucks, Elizabeth Feliciano trudged the other morning on foot across the McBride Viaduct, late for school. Arching over a gritty scrap-metal yard and railway line, the graffiti-scrawled 1,170-foot-long bridge links two of this city\u2019s poorest neighborhoods.\n\nImage\n\nWhen the viaduct opened in the late 1930s, the city was growing. The bridge, renovated in the 1970s, was an emblem of local pride and progress. It funneled traffic through what were at the time thriving neighborhoods.\n\nThen the factories started disappearing. The viaduct\u2019s largely German, Polish and Irish district became home to increasing numbers of blacks, Latinos and refugees from Africa and the Middle East, whose arrivals have slowed the city\u2019s population decline.\n\nOn one level, the story of the bridge is a microcosm of America\u2019s crumbling infrastructure. Questions about where to spend the city\u2019s limited resources touch on familiar themes about the failures of urban renewal and today\u2019s widening income gap.\n\nAt the same time, the debate over the fate of a decaying relic of midcentury industrial architecture has focused a particular spotlight on Erie\u2019s legacy of disenfranchisement and its troubled race relations.\n\nImage Mary Whalen prayed before the noon Mass at St. Anne's Church just north of the viaduct. The viaduct is named for a former pastor of the church, Msgr. Lawrence McBride, who campaigned for its construction after a child was killed crossing the tracks. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\nThe legacy lives on: Erie was recently ranked the worst city in the country for African-Americans. Using national census data, the news organization 24/7 Wall Street found that 47 percent of the city\u2019s black population lives at or below the national poverty line, twice the rate for African-Americans nationally and more than four times the rate for whites in Erie.\n\nAfter the ranking was published in November, The Erie Times-News took issue with some of the survey\u2019s numbers, but not the gist. Median income for black residents in the city languishes at around half that of white residents; the unemployment rate is more than triple the national average.\n\nAnd City Hall is perceived by many black residents as an enclave of white privilege.\n\n\u201cThis city spends a huge amount to pay for police to incarcerate people from our community,\u201d said Cee Williams, a former Erie County poet laureate. There are only eight minority police officers of the 173 officers employed by the city.\n\n\u201cHow about spending some of that money on fixing the bridge,\u201d Mr. Williams said, suggesting that such an approach \u201cmight help change the lives of kids who end up costing the public a fortune in prison.\u201d\n\nImage Police officers responded to a domestic disturbance call at a home in the lower east side of Erie, during a winter storm that caused widespread power failures. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\nThe bridge, a picturesque ruin riddled with potholes, is today a victim of this region\u2019s harsh weather and an unspoken City Hall policy of demolition by neglect. Lately, students from Gannon University, on the other side of Erie, have adopted it as a hangout and cause \u2014 a miniature untapped version of New York\u2019s repurposed rail tracks known as the High Line. Local teenagers use it as a de facto elevated park, for lack of green space.\n\nMore than a few, like Ms. Feliciano, walk or bike across it because, as she said, \u201cit\u2019s still the safest, shortest route\u201d over the tracks. It is better, they contend, than the pedestrian path, with its dangerous street crossing, along a busy expressway that the city built a block away.\n\nOne city block may not seem far. But to those who have to walk it, it can seem like another unfair burden that some in the community have been forced to bear. Unlike the expressway, the viaduct \u201cgoes where we want to go,\u201d Ms. Feliciano said.\n\nLandscape architects have a poetic term for this. They call it a desire line.\n\nStill, Erie officials are poised to tear the bridge down, insisting the cost of its repair and maintenance is simply prohibitive. They say only a clique of preservationists really cares about saving the viaduct, noting that residents from the neighborhood rarely showed up at public meetings over the years to support it.\n\nImage Taquanta Gray and Noel Remigio at home with their daughter, Nivea, 2, and dog, Blue. Ms. Gray said she used the bridge regularly to visit her parents and extended family. The loss of the bridge would mean a longer, more perilous commute for the family, she said. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\n\u201cThe reason black people weren\u2019t showing up at public meetings to talk about the viaduct is that they have lost hope,\u201d said Shantel Hilliard, longtime executive director of the Booker T. Washington Center. \u201cWhy bother when things here never change?\u201d\n\nAlso called the East Avenue Bridge, the viaduct opened in 1938. A Catholic pastor in the neighborhood, Msgr. Lawrence McBride of St. Ann\u2019s Church, campaigned for the bridge after a child was killed trying to cross the tracks.\n\nFor decades, the span fed thousands of pedestrians, cars and trucks onto East Avenue, the area\u2019s main street. But it was shut to traffic almost eight years ago, after officials had poured some $180 million into the expressway over the tracks, called the Bayfront Connector, which was completed in 2005. The Bayfront Connector was, in essence, an old-fashioned traffic engineer\u2019s vision of urban renewal, with all the predictable results.\n\nThe expressway sped suburbanites in their cars in and out of Erie. But it cleaved a struggling inner-city district, cutting off homes from schools, devastating East Avenue businesses, turning neighborhood streets into dead ends and deflating already-low housing values, while encouraging crime on some of those dead-end streets.\n\nThe city\u2019s new mayor, Joe Schember, had barely moved into City Hall in January before announcing his determination to tear the old bridge down \u201cas quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nMr. Schember, a Democrat, acknowledged the expressway\u2019s ill consequences, and even brought up that damning report about Erie and its black population.\n\nImage Kamarion Barney, 13, walked home from school over the McBride Viaduct.

They point to a new $5 increase in vehicle registration fees that promises Erie an additional $1.4 million a year for infrastructure improvements, a fund that could help pay to fix the bridge.\n\n\u201cWe have serious problems on the east side,\u201d Mr. Schember said. \u201cIf the city is going to put money to work there, there are much more worthwhile things to spend it on than the viaduct.\u201d\n\nHe has yet to spell those things out. In place of the viaduct, the city has been contemplating larger parking lots.\n\nFor East Side residents \u2014 many of whom cannot afford cars and who often take their lives into their hands dashing on foot across the multilane expressway, scrambling over its concrete Jersey barriers to get home or to the neighborhood Walmart \u2014 the viaduct remains not just a way to get where they are going. It is a measure of where the city is headed.\n\nImage From left, Traivyon Spencer, 3, Kiahra Moffett, 11, and Shalee Spencer, 12, hopped over several concrete barricades to cross the Bayfront Connector on their way home after school.

Anthony Harris, who oversees the largely black congregation at Shiloh Baptist Church, near the viaduct.\n\nMayor Schember has lately promised new, safer pedestrian crossings along the connector and improvements to the expressway\u2019s pedestrian path over the tracks. With funds having already been allocated for the viaduct\u2019s demolition, he said, acting expeditiously on the low bid by an out-of-town firm called Swank may throw off \u201cadditional resources\u201d for \u201cbeautifying that area, for which we will seek resident input,\u201d he said.\n\nThe mayor has in the meantime endorsed Erie Refocused, a comprehensive plan he inherited from the previous administration that was never carried out. Among other things, it calls for improved community engagement, public spaces and streets geared more toward pedestrians and bikes.\n\nThese are precisely the arguments for fixing the viaduct, preservationists say.\n\nImage A gate where people can gain access and cross the train tracks through the grounds of scrap yards and industrial businesses.

His grandfather was a second-generation Polish-American who settled on the east side and worked for General Electric, where Mr. Wieczorek\u2019s father also worked, before the company drastically downsized.\n\nMr. Wieczorek has two young children, lives on the West Side, and endorses the idea of investing in downtown and along the waterfront, to attract more businesses and tourists, not in what he called \u201cfailing neighborhoods\u201d on the east side.\n\n\u201cI cannot find the type of housing, with neighbors I would want to live with, on the east side,\u201d Mr. Wieczorek added. \u201cWe need to prepare people to move out of those neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nHe recalled Richard Florida, the urbanist who years ago theorized about city cores radiating prosperity by cultivating a \u201ccreative class.\u201d When asked about Erie, Mr. Florida said that his thinking \u201chas evolved\u201d in light of increasing urban inequity.\n\n\u201cThe creative class can\u2019t mean only recruiting artists and people who work for tech companies,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has to include cultivating talent from within \u2014 immigrants, refugees, African-American communities.\u201d\n\nAt a raucous City Council meeting in February, advocates for the bridge loudly pleaded with the mayor while he stuck to his prepared remarks about tearing it down.\n\n\u201cWe have students who walk miles every day, through the snow because they don\u2019t own cars,\u201d said Gary Horton, who directs the Erie chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. and the E.F. Smith Quality of Life Learning Center on the city\u2019s East Side, where new immigrants learn English. \u201cThe viaduct doesn\u2019t seem important to people in City Hall. But for people looking to get ahead, it is not a side issue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about hope.\u201d\n\nImage Shawn Moffett, 24, made his way home from work as a snowstorm blanketed the viaduct.

That is why Sawsan Chebli, a Berlin state legislator with Palestinian heritage, recently came up with an idea that is radical even by the standards of a country that has dissected the horrors of its past like no other: make visits to Nazi concentration camps mandatory \u2014 for everyone.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThis is about who we are as a country,\u201d she said in a recent conversation in Berlin. \u201cWe need to make our history relevant for everyone: Germans who no longer feel a connection to the past and immigrants who feel excluded from the present.\u201d\n\nMs. Chebli\u2019s proposal comes at a time when Germany is grappling with the creeping rise of two kinds of anti-Semitism and as the Jewish community, now numbering about 200,000, is once again nervous.\n\nNeo-Nazis have been emboldened by the arrival of Alternative for Germany, the first far-right party to break into Parliament since World War II. And there are concerns that the recent absorption of more than a million immigrants, many from the Middle East and many Muslim, has inadvertently created incubators of a different kind of anti-Semitism \u2014 one hiding behind the injustices of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but often reverting to hateful old stereotypes, too.\n\nIt was the sight of Arab immigrants, including Palestinian-Germans like herself, burning an Israeli flag underneath the Brandenburg Gate in December while chanting \u201cDeath to Israel\u201d that moved Ms. Chebli to speak up.\n\nSince then, other disturbing stories have emerged in the German news media: an Afghan boy greeting his teacher with \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d and proclaiming that he, too, was Aryan.

Swastikas were a common sight in her town: Scrawled on the inside of toilet cubicles. Graffitied onto walls. A boy in her class had tattooed one on his shin.

He fears an obligation to come would take away from the learning experience.\n\nMr. Hetzelein disagrees. Whether schools or the law make the call, students rarely get a say.

More than a decade ago he helped block the passage of a statewide needle-exchange program aimed at curbing the spread of H.I.V. from contaminated hypodermic needles, pitting himself against his own party.\n\nHis position on cannabis legalization not only puts him at odds with the governor and members of his party, but also with many African-Americans.\n\nIn New Jersey, African-Americans are three times more likely to be charged with marijuana possession than whites, even though both populations use the drug at similar rates. That has galvanized civil rights groups like the N.A.A.C.P. and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey to support legalization.\n\n\u201cAll the collateral consequences that come with an arrest \u2014 jail time, losing your job, losing your housing \u2014 are disproportionately falling on communities of color,\u201d said Dianna Houenou, a lawyer with the A.C.L.U. of New Jersey. \u201cThrough legalization we can begin to address the harms that have been inflicted.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA statewide coalition of black pastors, the N.A.A.C.P. and the New Jersey chapter of the Drug Policy Alliance is pushing for legalization as a social justice issue, but only if it is linked to some type of compensation for the harm they say was done to black and brown families whose sons were incarcerated. The pastors said they wanted to make sure members of their communities were able to participate in the billion-dollar cannabis industry as growers and sellers, not just workers. They are frustrated that the wealth being generated in the other states where marijuana is legal is not reaching people of color.\n\nResearchers at Marijuana Business Daily, an industry news site based in Denver, found that 81 percent of cannabis business owners were white, while less than 4 percent were black.\n\nMarijuana and racism have long been intertwined, dating back to the post-Prohibition era in the 1930s when the country\u2019s first drug czar gained traction for his war on marijuana by invoking a fear of black people. In the 1970s, President Richard Nixon\u2019s war on drugs targeted black people, as well as hippies.\n\n\u201cPoliticians and government officials used cannabis prohibition to target and criminalize black and brown people and throw them in jail,\u201d said Loretta Winters, president of the Gloucester County chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. \u201cWe demand that a huge piece of the business that this legislation will generate should make up for all the pain, suffering and loss of revenue that our black and brown communities have been subjected to.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAt a marijuana legalization forum held recently at Bethany Baptist Church in Newark, the Rev. Charles Boyer of Bethel A.M.E. Church in Woodbury said the worst thing that could happen was for communities most harmed by the prohibition to not have a say about legalization.\n\n\u201cDo we want to be the ones responsible for playing a part in a system that will make tons of young white millionaires after years of making hundreds of thousands of poor black felons?\u201d Pastor Boyer said.\n\nThe Drug Policy Alliance is lobbying for a bill that includes the automatic and retroactive expungement of criminal records for possession, making permits for cannabis shops affordable so that the market is accessible to lower-income entrepreneurs, and a commitment that a portion of the revenue from marijuana sales be used to provide education and job training for people of color.\n\nSome social justice activists are also calling for allowing people to grow their own cannabis plants.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nState Senator Nicholas Scutari, a Democrat from Linden, is the author of a bill that would legalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana for anyone over 21 and would establish a state Division of Marijuana Enforcement. But it does not include any language discussing compensation.\n\nMr. Scutari agrees that arrests for marijuana possession are disproportionately higher for blacks and Latinos and says his bill addresses the issue of social justice.\n\n\u201cThe individuals that are previously convicted of marijuana possession will no longer be subject to prosecution,\u201d Mr. Scutari said.\n\nHe also said he was willing to consider other demands \u2014 but most likely in a separate bill. Mr. Scutari said any initial revenue from marijuana sales must first fund the state\u2019s program, including hiring staff, before paying for drug treatment, fixing the state\u2019s pension debt or building roads.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Rice has proposed his own marijuana bill that would decriminalize the possession of 10 grams or less of marijuana, and make carrying more a disorderly persons charge that would impose only a fine. It would also expunge criminal records and release incarcerated people serving sentences for possessing small amounts of marijuana. But Mr. Scutari said that decriminalization would simply create an open-air drug market that would allow drug dealers to get richer without creating any kind of regulatory system to control how marijuana is sold.\n\nUltimately, any effort to promote civil rights could depend on what kind of bill Mr. Murphy is willing to sign. In a statement, Daniel Bryan, a spokesman for the governor, said that Mr. Murphy was committed to \u201cthe goal of building a stronger and fairer New Jersey, and supports the legalization of marijuana to advance the cause of social justice and combat the racial disparities in our criminal justice system.\u201d", "keywords": ["drug", "justice", "legal", "racial", "marijuana", "mr", "cannabis", "black", "bill", "jersey", "social", "possession", "fight", "scutari", "legalization", "pot", "drives"], "polarity": 0.07900764201784606, "subjectivity": 0.4244901640309803},

I believe that this constant social navigation is ripe for exploration.\n\n\u2014 India Lovato\n\nIn 1988, I saw \u201cThe Milagro Beanfield War.\u201d Most of the characters were Mexican and they were just portrayed as people, not some \u201cFrito Bandito\u201d joke. It made me want to cry with relief.\n\n\u2014 Dawn Reed\n\nGrowing up Italian and plus-size, I never saw women like me in the movies. The closest thing to representation I saw was \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d but my family wasn\u2019t violent or in organized crime so I couldn\u2019t relate. I\u2019m still waiting to see characters like me.\n\n\u2014 Tiffany Magazzeni\n\nI\u2019m still waiting to see myself. I mean there is Michelle Yeoh, an Asian actress in the 1997 movie \u201cTomorrow Never Dies.\u201d She\u2019s not me, but I loved that her character defies the usual Hollywood stereotypes for Asians. But she is not American and I\u2019m not at all a Bond woman. I grew up watching movies and I love the old Hollywood movies especially, but it makes me sad to realize that Hollywood\u2019s portrayal of Asians has been mocking or missing for most of its history. Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan are also imports. There just aren\u2019t any homegrown Asian-American filmmakers yet.\n\n\u2014 Lillian Hsu\n\nI am an African-American man born in 1960, raised in Southern California. The first time I remember seeing someone who looked like me represented on screen in the way I saw myself was in 1967. It was Jim Brown in \u201cThe Dirty Dozen\u201d: a strong, brave, athletic black man fighting with the good guys against the bad guys.\n\n\u2014 Darren Casonhua\n\nIt may seem bizarre, but \u201cMoonlight\u201d helped me better understand myself as an upper-middle-class heterosexual white woman growing up in the Midwest. Through some common coming-of-age feelings of loneliness and confusion, but also in better understanding the differences, I learned more about myself.\n\n\u2014 Sally Otis\n\nAlthough I am white, I am Jewish with \u201cbig\u201d hair, raised in the Bronx. I saw myself reflected in \u201cFunny Girl.\u201d With a New York City backdrop, song lyrics and Barbra Streisand\u2019s delivery, I felt for the first time, in the eyes of the larger world, at age 12, accepted.\n\n\u2014 Jill Sager\n\nImage Diahann Carroll and Sidney Poitier in \"Paris Blues.\" Credit Kino Lorber\n\nI am 70 years old and watched classic Hollywood movies on television during the 1950s and \u201960s. The first film I saw people who looked like me and behaved in ways I recognized was \u201cParis Blues\u201d with Sidney Poitier and Diahann Carroll, who were in love and kissed on screen. Amazing!\n\n\u2014 Donna Bailey\n\nThe first time I saw myself represented was in high school. Spike Lee made an all-black musical, \u201cSchool Daze,\u201d and I was in awe. I clearly remember sitting in my seat amazed at seeing all of the different shades of black people on the big screen and feeling proud because I was finally being seen through them.\n\n\u2014 Cathleen Jagarnauth\n\nI\u2019m a white, 68-year-old woman and the first time I saw myself on the screen was in 1987 when Holly Hunter was in \u201cBroadcast News.\u201d She was opinionated, pushy, demanding and terribly emotionally fragile, taking a few minutes to cry. When her producer told her it must be nice to know exactly what everyone else should be doing, she said, \u201cNo. It\u2019s horrible.\u201d When the movie ended I literally sat in the movie theater and cried in recognition.\n\n\u2014 Carolyn Langenkamp\n\nFor more coverage of race, sign up to have our newsletter delivered weekly to your inbox.", "keywords": ["representation", "im", "black", "movies", "mirror", "white", "screen", "movie", "mulan", "saw", "hollywood", "film"], "polarity": 0.10436236628385391, "subjectivity": 0.37851373832778806},
{"title": "\n                    Google Is Trying Too Hard (or Not Hard Enough) to Diversify                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/09/technology/google-diversity-lawsuits.html", "text": "\u201cMy impression is that Google is not sure what to do,\u201d said Michelle Miller, a co-executive director at Coworker.org, a workers\u2019 rights organization that has been working with some Google employees. \u201cIt prevents the ability of a company to function when one group of workers is obstinately focused on defeating their co-workers with whatever it takes.\u201d\n\nThe division within Google spilled into the open last year when James Damore, a software engineer, wrote a memo critical of its diversity programs. He argued that biological differences and not a lack of opportunity explained the shortage of women in leadership and technical positions.\n\nGoogle fired Mr. Damore. He filed a lawsuit in January with another former employee, claiming that the company discriminates against white men with conservative views. In a separate lawsuit, a former recruiter for YouTube sued Google because, he said, he was fired for resisting a mandate to hire only diverse \u2014 female or black and Latino \u2014 candidates.\n\nGoogle\u2019s handling of the issue was also upsetting to Mr. Damore\u2019s critics. In another lawsuit filed last month, a former Google employee said he was fired because he was too outspoken in advocating diversity and for spending too much time on \u201csocial activism.\u201d\n\nInside Google, vocal diversity proponents say they are the targets of a small group of employees who are sympathetic to Mr. Damore. In some cases, screenshots of comments made on an internal social network were leaked to online forums frequented by right-wing groups, which searched for and published personal information like home addresses and phone numbers of the Google employees, they said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2015, Google started an internal program called Respect@, which includes a way for employees to anonymously report complaints of inappropriate behavior by co-workers. Some diversity supporters say other employees are taking advantage of this program to accuse them of harassment for out-of-context statements.\n\n\u201cSome people feel threatened by movements that promote diversity and inclusion. They think it means people are going to come for their jobs,\u201d said Liz Fong-Jones, a Google engineer who is a vocal supporter of diversity.\n\nMany big tech companies are struggling with the challenge of creating a more diverse work force. In 2015, Facebook adopted the so-called Rooney Rule. Originally used by the National Football League to prod teams to consider coaching prospects who are black, the rule requires managers to interview candidates from underrepresented backgrounds for open positions. But last year, Facebook\u2019s female engineers said that gender bias was still a problem and that their work received more scrutiny than men\u2019s work.\n\nEven executives tasked with promoting diversity have had difficulties. In October, Denise Young Smith, who was Apple\u2019s vice president of inclusion and diversity, came under fire when she said that there was diversity even among 12 white, blue-eyed, blond men because they had different backgrounds and experiences. She later apologized, saying she did not intend to play down the importance of a non-homogenous work force. She left Apple in December.\n\nThe tension is elevated at Google, at least in part, by its workplace culture. Google has encouraged employees to express themselves and challenge one another. It provides many communication systems for people to discuss work and nonwork related issues. Even topics considered out of bounds at other workplaces \u2014 like sharp criticism of its own products \u2014 are discussed openly and celebrated.\n\nIn January, on one of Google\u2019s 90,000 \u201cgroups\u201d \u2014 internal email lists around a discussion topic \u2014 an employee urged colleagues to donate money to help pay Mr. Damore\u2019s legal fees from his lawsuit against Google to promote \u201cviewpoint diversity,\u201d according to a person who saw the posting but is not permitted to share the information publicly.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nSome Google employees who are diversity advocates said management had not taken action against people who tried to bait them into making angry statements.\n\nLast month, Tim Chevalier, who had worked at Google as an engineer until November, sued for wrongful termination, claiming that he was fired \u201cbecause of his political statements in opposition to the discrimination, harassment and white supremacy he saw being expressed on Google\u2019s internal messaging systems.\u201d He said one employee had suggested that there was a shortage of black and Latino employees at Google because they were \u201cnot as good.\u201d\n\nMr. Chevalier said he had been fired shortly after saying that Republicans were \u201cwelcome to leave\u201d if they did not feel comfortable with Google\u2019s policies. He said he had meant that being a Republican did not exempt Google employees from following the company\u2019s code of conduct.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA Google spokeswoman said in a statement that the company encouraged lively debate. But there are limits.\n\n\u201cCreating a more diverse workplace is a big challenge and a priority we\u2019ve been working to address. Some people won\u2019t agree with our approach, and they\u2019re free to express their disagreement,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Gina Scigliano. \u201cBut some conduct and discussion in the workplace crosses a line, and we don\u2019t tolerate it. We enforce strong policies, and work with affected employees, to ensure everyone can do their work free of harassment, discrimination and bullying.\u201d\n\nIn the past, discussions about diversity in Google\u2019s online chat groups would encounter skeptical but subtle comments or questions. The debate turned openly antagonistic after Mr. Damore\u2019s memo, which was titled \u201cGoogle\u2019s Ideological Echo Chamber.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe James Damore thing brought everything to a head,\u201d said Vicki Holland, a linguist who has worked at Google for seven years. \u201cIt brought everything to the surface where everyone could see it.\u201d\n\nMr. Damore said he began to question Google\u2019s diversity policies at a weekly company meeting last March. At the meeting, Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s vice president of people operations, \u201cpointed out and shamed\u201d departments in which women accounted for less than half the staff, according to Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe two female executives \u2014 who are among the company\u2019s highest-ranking women \u2014 said Google\u2019s \u201cracial and gender preferences were not up for debate,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Mr. Damore subsequently attended a \u201cDiversity and Inclusion Summit,\u201d where it reinforced his view that Google was \u201celevating political correctness over merit\u201d with its diversity measures.\n\nMr. Damore said he had written his memo afterward in response.\n\nMs. Scigliano, the Google spokeswoman, said the company looked forward to fighting Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit in court. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said in an August blog post that he had fired Mr. Damore because his memo advanced \u201charmful gender stereotypes\u201d but that \u201cmuch of the memo is fair to debate.\u201d\n\nSome employees said they were abstaining from internal debate on sensitive issues because they worried that their comments might be misconstrued or used against them. Like the broader internet, the conversations tend to be dominated by the loudest voices, they said.\n\nGoogle\u2019s diversity advocates said they would like to see more moderation on internal forums with officials stepping in to defuse tensions before conversations get out of hand. Ms. Miller, the Coworker.org co-director, said Google employees had expressed concern about how this would affect an internal culture rooted in transparency and free expression.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s on everyone\u2019s mind is: Has the culture been inextricably damaged by this environment?\u201d she said.", "keywords": ["googles", "mr", "hard", "internal", "work", "fired", "google", "diversity", "lawsuit", "damore", "diversify", "employees", "trying"], "polarity": 0.08552789802789805, "subjectivity": 0.3460065686628187},

Credit Melissa Lyttle for The New York Times\n\nGood neighbors\n\nFive years ago we moved from Torrance to two floors near the top of the 801 Tower in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nShortly after we moved here, the woman who at the time at the time was the C.E.O. of Greenland USA, the U.S. subsidiary of a Chinese construction firm, made a formal visit about a skyscraper they were building across the way.\n\nShe asked if we would mind if they built it a little higher, which could obstruct our view. We both knew it was just a courtesy, but I thought her old-world charm was very classy. We\u2019re now one of their preferred mortgage lenders.\n\nAn open-door policy\n\nMy office is just past the reception area as you exit the elevator. I chose that location by design, to be accessible. I also leave my door open since I believe closed doors can appear ominous and threatening.\n\nTwo of our female executives and I designed our entire space with an architect and a designer. We have both Asian and American customers, and I wanted the area to reflect the two cultures. Having lived on three continents, I had a feeling about what that might look like: bright colors to jolt people into happiness about when they arrive, and free-flowing space.\n\nImage The office contains elements of both Asian and American cultures. Credit Melissa Lyttle for The New York Times\n\nMemories of home\n\nAt my high school in Pakistan, as a mildly gifted cricket player who barely made the cut, I learned the value of being on a team without being the M.V.P. I use the cricket bats on the weekends with my sons, like an American family goes outside and throws the football around.\n\nMy father\u2019s walking stick is in the corner. I was schooled in the British system of education, which has a formality that never leaves you. It means that sometimes you feel you\u2019re a stranger in a strange land.\n\nSting moved to the U.S. like I did, and when he came out with \u201cEnglishman in New York,\u201d it resonated with me, especially the lines \u201cSee me walking down Fifth Avenue, A walking cane here at my side.\u201d\n\nYou occasionally see walking sticks in English movies, and my father and other Pakistani men used them to shoo away stray dogs on the road.\n\nCloseness and discipline\n\nI hold meetings with my staff at the oval glass-topped table so that the distance between us is never more than a few feet.\n\nI also use the table as a desk, but I spend much of my time at my standing desk. I switched to it about 10 years ago after a former Royal Navy officer impressed upon me that part of his training was learning to stand watch for 10 hours at a time. I was fascinated by the idea that building discipline into humdrum activities like responding to emails is a persistent way of remaining alert all day.\n\nKeeping time\n\nEarlier in my career I worked at Citibank. The blue clock, a memento, marks the tremendous success of its revolutionary digital services platform, myCiti, which launched in 2001. It helped to boost my career and survives to this day.\n\nImage Mr. Menai\u2019s copy of \u201dThe Spectator.\" Credit Melissa Lyttle for The New York Times\n\nImage Along with favorite books and his grandfather\u2019s fountain pens, Mr. Menai keeps a note from his then 8-year-old son.

My most prized literary possession is a 300-year-old compilation of \u201cThe Spectator,\u201d a periodical that described basic social obligations during that time.\n\nFamily heirlooms\n\nWhen I was 18, I brought a mug from my college, Coe College in Iowa, to the woman in Pakistan who would become my wife. I keep it here now, along with my grandfather\u2019s fountain pens. I also have the note my then 8-year-old son Nabi wrote with one when I showed him how to fill the bladder with ink. It was humorous and I was glad to see he could write well.\n\nPieces of history\n\nWhen I was overseeing Citibank marketing for Asia, a colleague gave me a framed replica of shoes worn by Chinese women who underwent foot-binding in the 10th century to keep their feet small as a symbol of social status. The shoes remind me of how certain ersatz practices can seem perfectly normal until the march of history exposes them as absurd.\n\nIt is our job to think critically and question whether certain current practices are the foot-binding of our age.\n\nOrder Reprints | Today\u2019s Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page BU 2 of the New York edition with the headline: Bridging Cultures in Downtown Los Angeles\n\n\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["cultures", "angeles", "lyttle", "credit", "downtown", "bridges", "los", "melissa", "bank", "york", "usa", "walking", "president"], "polarity": 0.1271839623600187, "subjectivity": 0.4025149889234396},

The approach seems to be working. In February, the Young Adult Library Services Association named \u201cLighter Than My Shadow,\u201d a graphic novel by Katie Green about a young woman\u2019s battle with eating disorders, one of the top 10 \u201cgreat graphic novels for teens\u201d published in 2017.

I didn\u2019t get access to real comic books until around the time Milestone, a comic publishing imprint that showcased African-American superheroes, came out. I remember it was cool to have characters that I could see myself in. When I discovered Comixology, a digital distributor of comics, I started reading again. My girlfriend at the time, who is now my wife, was an avid prose reader.

Digital comics were on the forefront of all that. You could do flip books and light animation and add soundscapes. Carl Reed, a co-founder of Lion Forge, was working in animation and was looking for the next thing, too. We got together with a couple of other guys and started exploring: Who are the players? What are they doing? Is the market saturated? We wanted to use digital as the litmus test for what you should print. You could tell the retailer: \u201cThis title sold well first digitally.

I remember thinking, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d It was kind of like a reflection of what someone else thinks that an African-American person is, which is different from actually having more of an authentic representation. Whatever group we are representing, we are definitely having someone of that group be a part of it.\n\nHow did you approach creating these comics and catering to the audience?\n\nI feel like for everybody to participate, you have to have representation that looks like everyone in this country. We\u2019ve been careful to make sure that it is an inclusive line of characters. Kind of like the United Colors of Benetton [laughs], but it feels natural and organic.

So instead of seeing my full self in Meg, I ended up cherry-picking the traits to which I could relate: her bravery and intelligence, or even more rare her feelings of abandonment and anger caused by her father\u2019s absence.\n\nAyana Mathis, the African-American author of the best-selling novel \u201cThe Twelve Tribes of Hattie,\u201d had a similar disconnect with this novel even though it remains her favorite book, alongside Mildred D.

It expanded me but it also scared me and not with cheap thrills, but because it asked such compelling questions about evil. IT was a brain that was frightening and instructive.\u201d\n\nIt was only when the director Ava DuVernay announced that Storm Reid would play Meg as a biracial girl in the screen adaptation that my relationship with the character started to change. Ms. Reid described Meg as \u201can African-American girl that is smart, that is beautiful and that basically realizes that she is enough.\u201d Through this awareness, the actress added, Meg \u201cjust taps into her superpowers to be able to save her dad, her brother and save the world.\u201d\n\nThis revision \u2014 alongside the film\u2019s broader multiracial cast, which includes Mindy Kaling, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Reese Witherspoon and Oprah Winfrey \u2014 not only expands the feminist reach of L\u2019Engle\u2019s original vision, but also directly challenges the overwhelming absence of girls of color as leads in Hollywood films in general, and science-fiction films in particular. As recently as 2012, controversy greeted Amandla Stenberg when she played Rue in the first \u201cHunger Games\u201d movie. Rue was a black character in the dystopian novel it was based on, but fans seemed not to realize it and complained loudly about the casting. Ms. Reid\u2019s turn as Meg, by contrast, seems to have only increased fan anticipation for the movie.\n\nMore radically, Ms. DuVernay\u2019s choice for Meg helps redefine our notions of the universal. Rather than assume children of color will seamlessly identify with Meg as we do with the book or with the young, white heroines of the \u201cHunger Games\u201d or \u201cDivergent\u201d franchise, this film gives us a different, racially inflected female future and present.\n\nAnd that changes how I now appreciate the book.\n\nIt is still my favorite from childhood, but now, rather than contort myself into Meg, I am able to see how the novel\u2019s play with time and space continues to influence me as an African-American writer. I\u2019m obsessed with how people, events and cultural objects from the past shape our understandings of race and gender in the present. \u201cA Wrinkle in Time\u201d might not ask the same questions that I do now, but it was the first novel I ever read that explored multiple time dimensions and gave me permission to imagine history as incomplete, unfolding, and a phenomenon with hopes that can be taken up by successive generations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter I was done with the novel this time, I put my copy on my 5-year-old daughter\u2019s bookshelf, for I am comforted by what she is now able to find in \u201cA Wrinkle in Time.\u201d Though we contemporary viewers and readers are unable to engage in interplanetary travel like Meg, Ms. DuVernay\u2019s version takes us somewhere even more substantive. By emphasizing diversity over dystopia, her film does not simply warn against the dangers of who we might become, but celebrates the vast richness of who we already are.", "keywords": ["book", "ms", "color", "hard", "africanamerican", "work", "films", "childrens", "saw", "meg", "york", "novel", "sign", "wrinkle"], "polarity": 0.09736605385956033, "subjectivity": 0.4660398043514926},

But he has used his entire career to tell America a story about itself that it does not want to hear: that racism exists today, and is pervasive outside of the Deep South. And he has worked ceaselessly toward two intertwined, impossible goals. First, the demand for equal rights for all. The second is about securing his legacy as the Martin Luther King of the North.\n\n\u201cWhat I want it to be is I helped urbanize the King movement,\u201d Mr. Sharpton said. \u201cI was the one that could bring the King movement into the Northern, urban centers.\u201d But where Dr. King\u2019s activism led to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Mr. Sharpton\u2019s efforts haven\u2019t amounted to national reform.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Sharpton, 63, figured he\u2019d be retired by now. He thought he\u2019d keep his Sunday-morning MSNBC program, \u201cPoliticsNation,\u201d and his daily radio show, \u201cKeepin\u2019 It Real.\u201d He said he was ready to name a successor to his civil rights organization, the National Action Network, and the marching, strategizing and agitating that came with it. All that was left to do was build a civil rights museum in Harlem. But riding off into a life of punditry isn\u2019t an option with Mr. Trump in office. Mr. Sharpton said he and his allies thought they were poised to help a President Hillary Clinton pass national police reform legislation. His mission is now different, and more modest.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to preserve what you\u2019ve got done,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will not matter if he revokes the Voting Rights Act, and the Civil Rights Act of Dr. King. You need to preserve the racial profiling laws, and police reform like stop and frisk,\u201d he continued. \u201cOtherwise, it\u2019ll be a bygone era.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nNow 133 pounds, Mr. Sharpton is less than half the man he was for much of his life. A morning salad and banana serve as his only real sustenance for the day, and in my time with him, he drank nothing but green tea \u2014 not even water. His flamboyant conk is now steely gray, slicked back over his thinning crown. He\u2019s quick to joke, but he rarely laughs. He has long since replaced his sweats with bespoke suits.\n\nBut the new Al Sharpton is the same person he always was.\n\nAlfred Charles Sharpton Jr. was born in 1954 to a middle-class family who had a house in a nice neighborhood in Queens. At 4, before he even knew how to read, young Al began preaching, and often practiced at home in his mother\u2019s robe. When he was just a boy, his mother connected Al with two pastors, Bishop F.D. Washington and the Rev. Dr. Bill Jones. They called him Boy Wonder, and he toured the country preaching before he was even a teenager. In 1967, Dr. Jones introduced the young preacher to a 26-year-old civil-rights activist named Jesse Jackson. Mr. Jackson took him under his wing, and Al decided he wanted to spend his life like the men who looked after him, fighting for civil rights in the prophetic tradition of Dr. King, who was assassinated when Mr. Sharpton was 13.\n\nIn 1971, when he was 16, Mr. Sharpton founded his first civil rights organization, the National Youth Movement, with money from Bayard Rustin, the chief organizer of the 1963 March on Washington. He met James Brown, who adopted him as his godson in 1973; for most of the next decade, Mr. Sharpton was always at the singer\u2019s side. If Jesse Jackson taught Mr. Sharpton how to organize, it was James Brown who taught him how to perform.\n\n\u201cI would watch what moves and what songs excited people, and I would take notes,\u201d Mr. Sharpton told me. \u201cBecause you\u2019ve got to keep people\u2019s attention.\u201d", "keywords": ["national", "mr", "act", "king", "dr", "movement", "sharpton", "rights", "reconsidered", "al", "civil"], "polarity": 0.10926573426573427, "subjectivity": 0.386868686868687},

Ken Frazier on Death Row Cases and the Corporate Soul\n\nImage Kenneth Frazier, the chief executive of Merck. \u201cI actually don\u2019t see that big a conflict between meeting the needs of shareholders and meeting the needs of society,\u201d Mr. Frazier said. Credit Mike Cohen for The New York Times\n\nThe role of the chief executive has never been more complex \u2014 or more consequential.\n\nBusiness leaders today are reshaping the internet, reimagining health care, upending transportation and more. But being a chief executive is no longer just about running a company. It means taking political stands on everything from immigration to gun rights. It means weighing in on tariffs and taxes \u2014 all while balancing short-term profits with long-term goals, dealing with activist investors and attracting talented employees.\n\nIn an effort to better understand the world\u2019s top chief executives \u2014 where they\u2019re coming from and how they deal with the challenges they face \u2014 The New York Times is bringing back Corner Office.\n\nFor nearly 10 years, Corner Office featured conversations about leadership and management with some 500 senior executives. The new Corner Office will build on this foundation and also cover the big issues of the day, from climate change to artificial intelligence. We\u2019ll be talking to prominent chief executives at big companies, innovators at lesser-known start-ups and organizational leaders in philanthropy, sports and the arts.\n\nWe want you to join the conversation. Let us know whom we should interview, and what questions you want answered below. And stay tuned as we bring Corner Office to life with multimedia, how-to guides and live events.\n\nAs we considered whom to interview first, Kenneth C. Frazier, the chief executive of Merck, was right at the top of the list. Mr. Frazier has a powerful personal story and has built an exceptional career.\n\nRaised in a poor neighborhood in Philadelphia, Mr. Frazier attended Penn State University and Harvard Law School. He joined Merck in 1992, defending the company against major lawsuits while resisting calls to slash research and development budgets.\n\nLast year, Mr. Frazier made headlines as the first chief executive to resign from a presidential advisory council following Mr. Trump\u2019s equivocating response to an outburst of white nationalist violence in Charlottesville, Va. As perhaps the most prominent black chief executive in the country, his stance carried powerful symbolism.\n\nThe Times published an article last month about Mr. Frazier\u2019s decision to resign from the advisory role. This interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted at Merck\u2019s headquarters in Kenilworth, N.J.\n\nYou once said that even though your father was a janitor, you believed he could have been a C.E.O.\n\nMy father was born in the year 1900 in South Carolina, and he grew up at a time where being an African-American child in the American South was to be deprived of access to anything close to a reasonable education. He only had three years of formal education, but he was self-taught. He read two newspapers a day. He could\u2019ve done a lot of things had he been born when I was born.\n\nTell me about his father.\n\nMy grandfather on my paternal side, Richard Frazier, was born in the late 1850s, and therefore was born into slavery, but was a sharecropper in South Carolina for his entire life. And one of the great things about my grandfather was that he sent my father north before he reached the age of maturity so that he, too, wouldn\u2019t become indebted to the land.\n\nHow did your parents raise you?\n\nI had a fantastic upbringing by two parents who cared deeply about their children, but more importantly believed that anything was possible for their children, and in some ways almost brainwashed us to be successful. They believed that despite the history of this country as it related to African-Americans, that for my siblings and I, that there would be tremendous opportunity. They also instilled that it was our responsibility to take advantage of the opportunities that they did not have.\n\nWhat drew you to the study of law?\n\nI\u2019ve always admired lawyers who use their power to affect social change, and Thurgood Marshall was always a childhood hero of mine.\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard Law School, you went to work at Drinker Biddle & Reath. Why there?\n\nI chose that firm in large part because they had a reputation of doing a lot of pro bono work. When I was at the firm, I read about the need in South Africa for law professors and lawyers to come from the U.S., because black law students in South Africa were obviously during apartheid only allowed to go to second-rate law schools.\n\nI lived one whole semester in Soweto. It was completely lawless. There were no streetlights. It was a completely separated area where people were contained, because the South African government\u2019s job, as it saw it, was to separate blacks from whites.\n\nBut what I remember more than anything else was interacting with people who their entire lives had been told that they were second class, that they were inferior, and how hard it was to get particularly the men to speak up in audible tones, because they had been in many ways told that their voice was not worth listening to. In addition to trying to teach people the substantive legal issues, it was a lot about trying to instill self-confidence.\n\n\u201cThe most important role of a leader is to safeguard the heritage and values of the company.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Ken Frazier\n\nYou also represented James Willie \u201cBo\u201d Cochran, a death row inmate. What was your first impression of his case?\n\nMy first reaction was, \u201cI\u2019m much too busy to take on another piece of pro bono litigation.\u201d But there were two younger lawyers in the firm who heard about the case, and they came to me and frankly they sort of shamed me into doing it.\n\nYou eventually won his freedom. What did that mean to you?\n\nIt was the high point of my professional career. This is a man who was facing an execution date for a crime he did not commit. And what I will never forget about Bo was that he had no sense of recrimination whatsoever. He was just thankful for every day that he had as a free man. It sort of reminds me of Nelson Mandela in the sense that he was able to live his life going forward without regard to trying to even scores.\n\nOne of the things that defined your early years at Merck was the defense against lawsuits over Vioxx, a painkiller that posed heart risk and was pulled off the market. Are there lessons to be learned from the way you approached that?\n\nThe central allegation that was underneath the Vioxx litigation was that this company put profit before patient safety. That went to the core of who we are as a company, and there was no way that we could allow that story to be unchallenged. We did not want Vioxx to become a verbal shorthand, like an Enron or something of that nature, for corporate wrongdoing. The most important role of a leader is to safeguard the heritage and values of the company.\n\nHow do you balance the pressure to deliver profits to public shareholders and also to make lifesaving drugs?\n\nI actually don\u2019t see that big a conflict between meeting the needs of shareholders and meeting the needs of society.\n\nVery early on in my tenure there was a lot of pressure being put on pharmaceutical C.E.O.s to cut their research budgets. And we value R & D as a company. It\u2019s who we are. It\u2019s the core of what we do. I made the decision that I wasn\u2019t going to cut our R & D budget, and that had some short-term negative consequences in terms of share price. But by taking those actions I think we were able to show that we really did care about what we said we were about as a company.\n\nThere are lots of examples of companies that have lost their way because they\u2019ve sort of lost their soul, which is a funny word to use, but companies do have souls.\n\nLast year, after President Trump\u2019s remarks following the violence in Charlottesville, you resigned from one of his advisory councils. What happened?\n\nIn that moment the president\u2019s response was one that I felt was not in concordance with my views, and I didn\u2019t think they were in concordance with the views that we claim to hold as a country. It was my view that to not take a stand on this would be viewed as a tacit endorsement of what had happened and what was said. I think words have consequences, and I think actions have consequences. I just felt that as a matter of my own personal conscience, I could not remain.\n\nWhat did you learn from the whole experience?\n\nC.E.O.s need to be very thoughtful and sober about the positions that they take publicly. Ultimately, if you believe strongly in something, you ought to say it, and you ought to say it in a very clear way.\n\nBill Horne in Newtonville, Mass., asks...\n\n\u201cIn what ways if any has your representation of prisoners on death row influenced your decisions as C.E.O.?\u201d\n\nWhat drew me to Merck was that the company\u2019s ethos had the same feel that pro bono work has, which is that you\u2019re really committed to serving your fellow human beings. I worked for 10 years to save one person\u2019s life in the context of the death penalty. Here we can make decisions every day with the stroke of the pen that can make lots of people\u2019s lives longer and healthier.\n\nHow do you prioritize your time?\n\nThere are three things that the C.E.O. should be focused on. Number one is that sense of purpose and direction that the company needs, making sure that that\u2019s always clear and people know what we\u2019re all about. The second thing is capital allocation. We only have so many resources. Making sure that you\u2019re putting those resources where you have the greatest opportunity. And the third, which I think by far is the most important, is to make sure that you have the right people in the most important jobs inside the company.\n\nWhat advice would you give to college graduates?\n\nI think people should seek adventure in life, as opposed to just allowing their ambitions to drive where they want to end up. Lots of people say, \u201cTell me what are the steps to get from here to the C.E.O.\u2019s office.\u201d I can say honestly I never sought to be a C.E.O. But what I\u2019ve always wanted was a new challenge, what I call an adventure. Seek adventure. Seek excitement in what you do.\n\nDavid Gelles is the Corner Office columnist and a business reporter.
