He had access to some of the same sensitive information Mr. Trump saw, but lacked a permanent security clearance.\n\nHis resignation, on Feb. 7 after two ex-wives accused him of abuse and photos surfaced of one with a black eye she said he had given her, prompted scrutiny over White House aides\u2019 clearances. Some, including Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, may now have their access to closely held materials revoked as investigations into their backgrounds continue.\n\nMr. Porter has denied abusing his ex-wives, and has instead suggested that the women have not shared the whole story. Several of his friends and former colleagues in Congress and in the White House share this belief. Mr. Porter has also privately told people that he believes the security clearance debacle says more about the dysfunction at the White House than it does about his behavior.\n\nMr. Porter declined to comment for this story. This account is based on interviews with two dozen people, many of whom would not be named because they still work in politics, were not authorized to comment or were reticent to speak publicly in his defense.\n\nThe elder Mr. Porter, a former aide to Presidents Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan and a Harvard professor since 1977, set high expectations for his oldest son, who followed his father\u2019s blueprint closely. Both were Rhodes scholars.\n\nThe family spent years gathering for dinners and events at the red brick Dunster House dormitory on the Harvard campus, where the elder Mr. Porter was a master. Mr. Porter\u2019s mother, who died in 2017, was the faculty dean of Dunster House, along the banks of the Charles River.\n\nThe family kept a home in Belmont, Mass., the town where the construction of a 69,600 square-foot Mormon temple was completed in 2000. The Porters socialized with other prominent Mormon families, full of high-achieving children and known to compete with each other. Mr. Porter and his three siblings were competitive, too \u2014 his youngest sister was the only Porter sibling not to attend Harvard.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTally Zingher, another former classmate, described Mr. Porter as \u201can upstanding guy driven by morals.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy memory of him is \u2018totally positive golden boy,\u2019\u201d Ms. Zingher added.\n\nIn 2000, Mr. Porter started dating his first wife, Colbie Holderness, who publicly accused him this month of abuse.\n\nPhoto\n\nOthers from his time in school or professional settings described being stunned at the allegations. Melissa Langsam Braunstein, a former vice president of the Harvard Republican Club who overlapped with Mr. Porter there, said he had a picture-perfect image at Harvard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unsettling, shocking and surprising,\u201d she said in an interview.\n\nMr. Porter graduated from Harvard in 2002 with a degree in government. According to the Harvard Gazette, a magazine published by the university, he chaired the university\u2019s chapter of Students for Bush, in addition to his work with the Republican Club.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The two were in love but sometimes argued over Mr. Porter\u2019s ambition, according to two people who were close to both during their marriage. In 2005, Ms. Holderness said that Mr. Porter punched her while the two were on vacation in Europe, and that he later took photos of a black eye she sustained during their argument. In 2008, Mr. Porter and Ms. Holderness divorced.\n\nBy late 2009, he was married to Jennifer Willoughby. Months later, she filed a restraining order against him for trying to enter her apartment while they were separated.\n\nThrough his personal struggles, Mr. Porter had support from his father, whose influence in Washington helped him secure jobs there.\n\n\u201cHis dad had a very strong hand in decisions that he made,\u201d Ms. Willoughby recalled, \u201cand also sometimes made connections for Rob.\u201d She, like his first wife, is Mormon as well.\n\nWhen he arrived on Capitol Hill in 2011, Mr. Porter was seen by many who knew him as confident and capable. Several colleagues say Mr. Porter was a consummate professional. As a chief counsel for Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, Mr. Porter reprimanded an aide who made an inappropriate comment toward a woman who worked in the office, according to two people who worked there at the time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Rob for several years, as both a friend and a co-worker,\u201d Ellen James, who worked with Mr. Porter in Mr. Lee\u2019s office, wrote in an email. \u201cI was never aware of any of the allegations that have become public over the last few days. To my knowledge, he always treated everyone with the utmost respect and professionalism in the workplace.\u201d\n\nKevin Smith, a spokesman for Senator Rob Portman, the Republican of Ohio in whose office Mr. Porter briefly worked as general counsel, said in a statement that no indication of inappropriate behavior was seen during Mr. Porter\u2019s time there.\n\nAfter working in Mr. Portman\u2019s office, Mr. Porter took the chief of staff job with Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, in 2014. According to two aides who worked with him there, Mr. Porter was arrogant and overly ambitious, even in a town that seems to have limitless capacity for both. He would occasionally lose his temper and become red in the face when he found himself on the losing end of a workplace argument, the aides said.\n\nAs he worked his way through Capitol Hill, Mr. Porter went through his second divorce in 2013. At some point during that separation, friends say Mr. Porter began to be less active within his Mormon community and began drinking, which is discouraged in the faith.\n\nTwo friends of Mr. Porter\u2019s, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation for appearing to defend him, said that Mr. Porter had at times struggled to reconcile a stringent religious background with his failed marriages. To be divorced once in the Mormon faith is unusual, they both said, and to be divorced twice is rare.\n\nUsually private about his personal life \u2014 few who knew him, including his colleagues at the White House, were even aware he had been married twice \u2014 he mentioned to at least one former colleague on Capitol Hill that he would never marry a Mormon woman again.\n\nAt the White House, Mr. Porter was seen a capable, if somewhat overeager, presence. The former White House official said that Mr. Porter had been discussed as a possibility as deputy chief of staff, but it was unclear whether his issues obtaining a security clearance prevented him from advancing.\n\nQuestions remain over who knew what, and when, about the investigation into Mr. Porter\u2019s background, including John F. Kelly, the chief of staff, and Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel. Late last year, a distraught girlfriend told Mr. McGahn that Mr. Porter had anger problems, according to people familiar with the conversation.\n\nMr. McGahn, who knew the woman, raised the issue with Mr. Porter, but did not follow up.", "keywords": ["worked", "harvard", "rob", "porters", "charisma", "mr", "ms", "ambition", "disguised", "republican", "house", "white", "mormon", "anger", "porter", "flareups"], "polarity": 0.06179723502304147, "subjectivity": 0.3278957780570683},
{"title": "\n                    Trump Edges Toward a Conventional Republican Approach, at Least on Policy                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/us/politics/trump-policy-republicans.html", "text": "Trump Edges Toward a Conventional Republican Approach, at Least on Policy Image President Trump boarding Air Force One at Palm Beach International Airport in West Palm Beach, Fla., on Monday. Many policies he has approved seem ordinary by the standards of modern Republican administrations. Credit Al Drago for The New York Times\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 If they squint hard enough, Republicans looking at President Trump can almost see George W. Bush.\n\nGovernment spending and the debt are soaring, provoking grumblings about fiscal recklessness. Taxes were slashed at the expense of balanced budgets. Thousands of additional troops have been deployed into war zones half a world away. And with the exception of some highly specific tariffs, international trade remains free and unfettered.\n\nFor all the ways Mr. Trump has defied and flouted the norms of his office, many policies that he has approved are downright ordinary by the standards of modern Republican administrations. It is a far cry from the mold-shattering approach he talked about before he became president, insisting he would punish China for \u201cripping us off,\u201d pull out of Afghanistan because \u201cwe waste billions there\u201d and slash the debt because it was \u201cbad for the country.\u201d\n\nMany Republicans say that what has unfolded so far is not the Trump administration they were expecting.\n\n\u201cThe biggest metaphor for this is that in Trump World, Steve Bannon is a smoldering ruin while the president has a good working relationship with Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan,\u201d said Rich Lowry, editor of National Review. \u201cA year ago, I think very few people would have thought that.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s Republican critics may be delighted that the status quo remains intact. But conservatives who believed his presidency would be more of a sharp break with the Bush years are starting to express alarm. And their concern could indicate trouble for Mr. Trump if his more conventional approach on some policy issues alienates his base and depresses Republican turnout in the midterm elections in November.\n\n\u201cRight at the point when everyone was thinking in my world that things were just going swimmingly, there are some good and important questions being raised,\u201d said Matt Schlapp, president of the American Conservative Union, which this week will host Mr. Trump as a speaker at its annual Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nOthers have been less generous. Mark Levin, the right-wing talk show host who is also set to speak at CPAC, recently asked his audience, \u201cIs conservatism dead?\u201d and accused lawmakers of \u201cspending like drunken Marxists.\u201d\n\nEven some Trump allies who were initially slow to trust him \u2014 precisely because they worried about his fidelity to conservative principles \u2014 are voicing skepticism. \u201cI hope this makes conservatives across the country realize that right now, they aren\u2019t getting what they voted for in Washington,\u201d Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who clashed bitterly with Mr. Trump during the 2016 Republican primaries but is now one of the president\u2019s confidants, wrote in an essay for Time.com.\n\nThe deficits that Mr. Trump and the Republican-led Congress just approved, added Mr. Paul, who was an early Tea Party star, \u201dwould make President Obama cringe.\u201d\n\nMany Republicans do indeed prefer the more accommodating version of the president when it comes to most policies. And despite the extraordinary aspects of his presidency, Mr. Trump has approached governing in a way that bears strikingly similar parallels to Mr. Bush and Ronald Reagan.\n\nOne of Mr. Bush\u2019s first official acts as president in January 2001 was to reinstate the Mexico City Policy, a global gag rule implemented under Mr. Reagan that withholds American aid from health organizations worldwide that provide or even discuss abortion in family planning. Just three days into his administration, Mr. Trump did the same thing. The White House has since sought to expand the order.\n\nImage President George W. Bush in 2008. Conservatives who believed the Trump presidency would be more of a sharp break with the Bush years are starting to express alarm. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s orders that government departments must safeguard religious liberties have echoes of Mr. Bush\u2019s efforts to promote \u201cfaith-based\u201d initiatives through special administrative offices in 11 federal agencies.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s effort to comb law schools and courtrooms across the country for young, unfailingly conservative nominees to the federal bench resembles the campaign Mr. Reagan undertook to leave an enduring rightward imprint on the courts.\n\nMr. Trump has also shown a great degree of deference to the military he once vowed to pull back from foreign conflict. Last year, he signed off on a troop surge in Afghanistan and he permitted the Pentagon to loosen its rules of engagement that dictate how the armed forces can pursue targets in places like Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. Military officials had complained the Obama White House\u2019s rules prevented them from moving quickly and effectively enough.\n\nHis approach to trade has been surprisingly muted compared with what he said when he was campaigning, earning him praise from unlikely corners of his party. \u201cTrump has generally been free trade, despite some worrisome rhetoric,\u201d said Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, one of the free market-oriented groups funded by the brothers Charles and David Koch.\n\nHe has not yet labeled China a currency manipulator. One of his most dramatic announcements to date, withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, had little practical effect because Congress never ratified it. And last week the Commerce Department said the nation\u2019s trade deficit with China, the official measure of how many goods American businesses import compared with exports, was the highest on record.\n\nOn health care Mr. Trump has even proposed ways to lower prescription drug costs, reminiscent of Mr. Bush\u2019s Medicare Part D.\n\nIn Mr. Trump\u2019s more conventional policies, Republicans see something they do not usually find in this White House: reassurance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons someone like me \u2014 who was in the \u2018Never Trump\u2019 camp and who ultimately didn\u2019t vote for Donald Trump \u2014 finds a lot in Donald Trump to like,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush\u2019s former press secretary.\n\nMany have come to accept Mr. Trump as someone who operates on two tracks, Mr. Fleischer added. \u201cThere\u2019s the policy track,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s the personal behavior track, which sets him so far apart that it risks drowning the rest out.\u201d\n\nThere are many ways, however, in which Mr. Trump has actually gone much further than his Republican predecessors in pursuing conservative policy goals \u2014 especially in the environmental and regulatory realm. Mr. Bush, for instance, appointed a moderate Republican governor from a heavily Democratic state to lead his Environmental Protection Agency, Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey. Mr. Trump named the attorney general of Oklahoma, Scott Pruitt, who had sued the agency multiple times.\n\nMr. Trump pulled out of the Paris climate accord and announced his intention to move the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem \u2014 moves most Republicans say other conservative presidents would likely have found too unsettling.\n\nBut if once-skeptical Republicans can find reasons in Mr. Trump\u2019s policies to look the other way on some of his personal shortcomings, there are also many who see little to like about his similarities with Mr. Bush, who turned budget surpluses into gaping deficits and helped spark the Republican backlash that became the Tea Party movement.\n\nMany activists have been ratcheting up the pressure. In response to Mr. Trump\u2019s signing the budget agreement and his embrace of a pathway to citizenship for younger immigrants brought here illegally as children, the Tea Party Patriots, one of the president\u2019s most reliable supporters, said conservative voters were not getting what they signed up for.\n\n\u201cThere is a sense of frustration among a lot of people who supported President Trump from the very beginning of his campaign,\u201d said Jenny Beth Martin, the group\u2019s president. \u201cThey feel a bit betrayed and they don\u2019t feel like President Trump is keeping his promise.\u201d\n\nSign Up for the Morning Briefing Get what you need to know to start your day in the United States, Canada and the Americas, delivered to your inbox.

Still, support has grown even among Democrats, from 8 percent just before the bill passed in December to 19 percent this month. For Democrats, Mr. Cohen said, running on opposition to the bill has become more of a political gamble.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s less of a sure bet than it seemed in December,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a problem yet for Democrats, but the movement isn\u2019t a positive one.\u201d\n\nOther recent polls have shown similar upswings for the law, including a Monmouth University Poll in late January that found support for it had risen to 44 percent nationally, from 26 percent in December.\n\n\u201cI think we are essentially seeing Republicans \u2018come home\u2019 on the tax plan in our data,\u201d said Lori Weigel, a partner with Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican polling firm. \u201cThat is certainly in part due to consistent communications about the tax plan and the news coverage of prominent companies investing in workers.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have done little to counter the Republican messaging and concede it has had an effect, along with a series of high-profile company announcements of bonuses, raises or other benefits attributed to tax savings.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut they are ramping up efforts to rebrand the law as disproportionately helping shareholders and the wealthy, and they contend the boost from bonus announcements will fade.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only so long you can push a one-time bonus,\u201d said Nicole Gill, executive director of Tax March, a liberal group that has organized rallies and protests against the new law. \u201cThe fundamentals of the bill remain the same. The bill that passed is the bill that polled at 35 percent in December, and Democrats should keep talking about that.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Times polling suggests that Americans are overestimating the degree to which the benefits of the law\u2019s corporate tax cuts are flowing straight to workers \u2014 while underestimating the likelihood that the law will reduce their individual taxes.\n\nJust under one in five respondents expect to see either a raise or a bonus thanks to the law\u2019s business tax cuts. Early returns from public companies indicate that\u2019s an overshot. Just Capital, a nonprofit research organization, analyzed the 90 largest public companies that have announced how they will spend the combined $45 billion in savings they stand to receive from the tax bill this year. It found that those companies planned to pass 6 percent of those savings directly on to workers, with more than half of that spending in one-time bonuses.\n\n\u201cThat does not really track to how the public thinks the companies should be spending that money,\u201d said Martin Whittaker, Just Capital\u2019s chief executive.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The independent Tax Policy Center in Washington estimates that four in five Americans will actually see a tax cut from the law this year, though that number is projected to shrink sharply in 2027 if individual tax cuts expire as scheduled in the law.\n\nRepublicans are confident that support will continue to grow as more Americans see lower taxes reflected in their paychecks. Their confidence was reflected last week by Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, who cited Senator Heidi Heitkamp\u2019s vote against the tax bill when announcing he would run for her seat.\n\n\u201cThere is no question the tax bill has fundamentally improved the overall political environment for Republicans,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a former campaign manager and chief of staff for Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, who is now president of the public affairs firm Cavalry in Washington.\n\nClose to half of Americans now expect some direct benefit from the law \u2014 either a tax cut or a salary increase or bonus. Support for the bill is far stronger among that group: More than three-quarters of Americans approve of the law, compared with fewer than a third who don\u2019t expect a benefit or aren\u2019t sure.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGina Coats, a project manager for a plumbing company in Springfield, Mo., said she didn\u2019t follow the tax debate closely last fall. But in January, when she began preparing the company\u2019s payroll systems to handle the new law\u2019s provisions, she realized almost every employee would take home an extra $20 to $40 per week.\n\n\u201cEveryone seems to be a little more upbeat,\u201d Ms. Coats said. \u201cIt\u2019s causing people to let go of their money a little more easily.\u201d\n\nMs. Coats puts herself in that category. A few days ago, she called a contractor to move forward with a long-delayed plan to replace the roof on her house. That decision reflected her tax savings, she said, but also the strength of the local economy, which has meant lots of projects for her company, and stability for its employees.\n\n\u201cIf we have more work in the bag, then I feel more comfortable,\u201d Ms. Coats said.\n\nRepublicans have long promoted tax cuts as a way to encourage economic growth. Many economists are skeptical of that approach when unemployment is low and the Federal Reserve is moving to tamp down inflation. Rising support for the bill has coincided with an uptick in consumer confidence, although there aren\u2019t yet clear signs that Americans are spending more.\n\nEdging Upward SurveyMonkey\u2019s consumer confidence index, which combines five questions on Americans\u2019 financial and economic outlook, rose in January and held onto those gains in February. 80 60 40 Total Republican Democrats 2017 April July Oct. 2018 Consumer confidence index\n\nColleen Doering, who runs a small facilities maintenance business outside Orlando, Fla., said she and her husband were paying several hundred dollars a month less in taxes because of the new law.

That may not be easy, however. Ms. Doering said it was already hard to find good workers, and the stimulus provided by the tax cuts could make it even harder.\n\n\u201cIt was becoming more challenging to find good, solid employees with the right skill sets,\u201d Ms. Doering said. \u201cIt\u2019s even more challenging because some of these larger companies are grabbing up even more employees.\u201d", "keywords": ["support", "americans", "democrats", "cuts", "public", "buoying", "tax", "republicans", "law", "gains", "bonus", "bill", "plan", "overhaul", "companies"], "polarity": 0.11880139959408251, "subjectivity": 0.39754073839439696},

About 25,000 New Hampshire residents paid full freight for Obamacare plans last year, according to a legislative report, and their premiums increased by an average 52 percent this year. This group earns more than four times the poverty level \u2014 for a family of three, like the Hurds, that\u2019s about $82,000 a year.\n\nAnother 29,000 were getting subsidized coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, and many of them have seen their out-of-pocket costs drop this year. That is because when Mr. Trump forced premiums higher by cutting off a type of payment to insurers last fall that the law had guaranteed them, subsidies rose, too. About 53,000 are getting free Medicaid coverage through the health law\u2019s optional expansion of the program.\n\nMs. Hurd remembers watching a documentary about people signing up for Obamacare coverage last year and bristling when someone who got a big subsidy gushed about the low price.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018It\u2019s not expensive for you because everybody else is paying for it,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nShe also has problems with the Medicaid \u201cexpansion population,\u201d made up of working-age adults who have no disability \u2014 particularly those who aren\u2019t working as hard as she and her husband are.

They bought a 1750s farmhouse just before they married; Ms. Hurd returned to work when their son, Harry, was eight weeks old.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThough roughly the same age, Ms. DiCola has followed a different course. She dropped out of the Manhattan School of Music in 2009 after her freshman year because she couldn\u2019t keep up with the tuition. Now, to supplement the scant income she gets from singing gigs, she drives for Uber and Lyft a few nights a week, sometimes more, in Boston. She earned about $15,000 last year, making sure she stayed under the threshold to qualify for Medicaid.\n\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s no different from what corporations do all the time, taking advantage of tax breaks and that sort of thing,\u201d Ms. DiCola, a soprano who talks animatedly about Verdi and Puccini, said of being on Medicaid. \u201cFrankly, if they\u2019re allowed to do it, why shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMedical care has been easy to access on Medicaid. She got physical therapy for an old injury, and when she needed to have an IUD surgically removed last year, she went to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Hanover, the state\u2019s most prestigious hospital. She paid for none of it. She spends most of her income on paying off her car, a used 2012 Prius with 160,000 miles on it, and her last outstanding student loan.\n\n\u201cThe coverage is actually really good,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just kind of finding my way, so the health insurance is so helpful.\u201d\n\nFor Ms. Hurd, health care has been something to avoid since she and her husband got the marketplace plan shortly after Harry\u2019s birth last year.

She went to an urgent care clinic for a throat culture last fall because unlike at her primary care practice, she could find out the cost, $150, upfront.

The story was about a report that found Medicaid recipients used health care more aggressively than marketplace customers, presumably because their coverage was free.\n\nInstead of giving its new Medicaid recipients traditional coverage through the program, New Hampshire uses Medicaid funds to buy them private plans through the Obamacare marketplace. The report, by an independent actuarial firm, found that average medical costs for the state\u2019s expansion population were 26 percent higher than for the marketplace\u2019s other customers in 2016.\n\nThe firm found this raised average claim costs \u2014 a proxy for premiums \u2014 for everyone by 14 percent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne of the conditions that Gov. Chris Sununu has attached to continuing expanded Medicaid here is that most adult recipients without a disability or small children will have to work, volunteer or get job training, at least 20 hours a week. New Hampshire is among eight Republican-controlled states asking the Trump administration for approval to impose work requirements; two others, Kentucky and Indiana, already got permission last month.\n\nMs. Hurd \u2014 who says she thinks \u201cwork is everything, honestly\u201d \u2014 is elated about the possibility.\n\n\u201cIf there were actual repercussions aside from your personal self-worth \u2014 like \u2018Hey, you may not be able to get the pills you need\u2019 \u2014 people might be more inclined to work,\u201d she said.\n\nBut research has found that most Medicaid recipients without disabilities, like Ms. DiCola, already work at least part-time.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI know I live with my parents, but I\u2019m not going on fancy trips or anything like that \u2014 I feel guilty when I buy a new lipstick,\u201d she said. She worried when she had the flu in December and lost four days of income, she said, adding, \u201cI\u2019d like not to feel like I\u2019m constantly so close to the edge.\u201d\n\nMs. DiCola started driving for Uber and Lyft three years ago, after stints at a Panera and a train station cafe. She often shuttles customers around Boston until after midnight, making up to $25 an hour \u2014 enough to pay two or three times more than the $87.50 she owes on her student loan each month, plus buy gas. Her days include pitching in on cooking and other household duties, auditions, rehearsals and studying musical scores on her couch, a cat or two by her side. She hopes to get a college degree, find a more stable career and get access to employer health coverage. But for now, with a free place to live and with Medicaid, she said, \u201cI\u2019m able to throw all my money at paying off my debt.\u201d\n\nAnxiety and Peace of Mind\n\nMs. Hurd is a former Republican who volunteered for Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign in 2012 and voted for Carly Fiorina in the 2016 primary, but now describes her politics as more libertarian. She\u2019s pro-immigration, not least because she sees immigrants as having strong work ethics. She voted for Hillary Clinton in the general election, she said, because she finds President Trump deeply offensive, a \u201cguy who bullied his way into power.\u201d\n\nHer father, a Trump voter from the Boston suburbs, sends her articles that are critical of the health law, and they resonate with her.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven members of her own family take advantage of a flawed system, in her view, by getting Medicaid. \u201cThey don\u2019t work because they don\u2019t want to, and they get free health insurance.\u201d She said. \u201cWhat the heck? If my husband and I, who grew up with relatively middle-class backgrounds in wealthy states, know people that mooch off the system in our immediate families, imagine what it\u2019s like elsewhere.\u201d\n\nMs. DiCola\u2019s father, a solo-practice lawyer, is also a Trump supporter, but she is a liberal Democrat and uneasily aware of the anger and frustration that unsubsidized Obamacare customers are feeling \u2014 so much so that at first, she worried about sharing her story with The New York Times and \u201cbeing dragged through the mud on some 24-hour news channel\u201d for being on Medicaid.\n\nShe described her state\u2019s plan to impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients as \u201cpoor-shaming.\u201d Her friends show more empathy, she said. When she needed a root canal and crown last year and Medicaid would not have paid for it (dental care is one area that Medicaid does not cover comprehensively, or sometimes at all), she posted about it on Facebook and her friends jumped in to help.\n\nMs. DiCola doesn\u2019t expect to need much health care this year \u2014 just a physical and a new pair of glasses, which Medicaid will cover, she said. Still, she added, \u201cYou never know what could come up \u2014 my appendix could decide to burst tomorrow.\u201d In which case, Medicaid would cover the emergency room visit, surgery and hospital stay, a huge relief to Ms. DiCola, who became so anxious as Republicans in Congress tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act last summer that she stopped working for a few weeks.\n\nMs. Hurd has had no such peace of mind. A burst appendix would likely cost at least her individual deductible of $6,300.\n\nBy late January, Ms. Hurd had begun to believe that the only way for her family to have any access to health care was to drop their insurance and save the $928 a month to spend on care when they need it. Harry\u2019s recent illness had rattled her, and Matt wanted to see a chiropractor for back pain that was threatening his ability to work.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t afford to both treat his back issues and pay for insurance,\u201d she said one morning. She was crying, and it was time to go to work.\n\nThe following week, after months of searching, Ms. Hurd got offered a full-time job with benefits, running social-media marketing for a company that sells plant nutrition products. The Hurds plan on dropping their Obamacare policy in April, when her new coverage, with a $300 monthly premium, should kick in. The deductible \u2014 $3,000 per person, up to $6,000 for the family \u2014 will still be higher than she\u2019d like, but she didn\u2019t complain. Her indignation seemed to be softening.\n\n\u201cI understand that some people cannot afford health care and shouldn\u2019t just be left to suffer,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there has to be a better way than asking a very small amount of people to foot that bill.\u201d", "keywords": ["free", "gwen", "squeezed", "medicaid", "health", "ms", "coverage", "dilemma", "dicola", "trump", "work", "care", "hurd", "obamacare"], "polarity": 0.08346217274788706, "subjectivity": 0.4160650724936438},

His white shirt and gray slacks were an accordion of wrinkles. His hair, flecked with gray, drooped on his forehead and small dark rings had formed under his eyes.\n\nBut he hadn\u2019t lost his voice. The Democratic congressman from El Paso was speaking to a crowd of several hundred at Suga\u2019s restaurant, 830 miles from home, trying to make an improbable case: that he can defeat Texas\u2019s incumbent Republican senator, Ted Cruz.\n\nDemocrats need to pick up two seats in the midterm elections to win control of the Senate, but they also must defend incumbents in 10 states that President Trump won. Mr. Cruz is seen as safer than, say, Dean Heller, Nevada\u2019s Republican senator, or the seats in Arizona and Tennessee that are being vacated by incumbents. And with Democratic money playing defense for incumbents in Missouri, Indiana, West Virginia and elsewhere, Mr. O\u2019Rourke expects no cavalry from Washington to come help him.\n\nBut Democrats will need wins wherever they can get them \u2014 so the long-shot is going it alone.\n\nImage The Brandon Community Center in Lufkin.\n\nImage Laura Bowman announced supporters of Mr. O'Rourke raised $1,200 for his campaign.\n\nImage Mr. O'Rourke arrived for a town hall event in Wharton, Texas.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke told the crowd at Suga\u2019s that the \u201cDreamers\u201d \u2014 young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children \u2014 should be protected. No wall should be built on the border with a friendly country. College must be more affordable. Women deserve access to reproductive health services. All Muslims should not be banned, and the press is not the enemy of the people.\n\nHe appealed to their sense of virtue. \u201cThis smallness, this bigotry, this paranoia, this anxiety,\u201d he said, cadence accelerating, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to be for the big, aspirational, ambitious things.\u201d\n\nHe appealed to their sense of humor. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason that Congress has an approval rating of around nine percent. Nine percent! Communism ten percent. Gonorrhea eight percent. We\u2019re right in the middle.\u201d\n\nAnd he appealed to their anger at Washington. The \u201csystem is rigged,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI can tell you that access is purchased, that votes are bought and paid for, that outcomes are determined before you have a chance to call your member of Congress or senator.\u201d\n\nThe crowd cheered, they hooted, they left saying things like \u201che was great\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\n\nImage A donation bin was passed around the room in Lufkin.\n\nBefore Beaumont, Mr. O\u2019Rourke spoke to town halls this month in Lufkin and Woodville, deeply conservative places where Democrats are rarely seen. \u201cIt takes guts to come to this area,\u201d one woman in Woodville said. The man who introduced him in Lufkin had just one request, that he refrain from swearing, an admonition that Mr. O\u2019Rourke heeded in Lufkin but not in Beaumont.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke is favored to win his party primary next month and challenge Mr. Cruz. But his odds in November are beyond long. No Democrat has won a statewide office in Texas since 1994, the year before Amazon sold its first book.\n\nBy the calculations of Mike Baselice, a Republican pollster in Austin, demographic changes might make Texas competitive in 2032, certainly not in 2018. Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s quest, he said, is \u201csame book, different chapter\u201d of other Democratic hopefuls. \u201cThis is not a level playing field here.\u201d\n\nIt has been so bleak for Democrats in Texas that they define victory in terms of the size of their losses. A running joke in Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s speeches is that he has almost convinced his mother, Melissa, a Republican, to vote for him.\n\nIf the hill weren\u2019t steep enough, Mr. O\u2019Rourke also has refused to hire outside consultants or pollsters, and he will only accept contributions from individuals. He has no interest in using big data. When he tells this to Democratic colleagues in the House, some have simply turned and walked away from him, unable to take him seriously.\n\nBut there is power in the giant-killer narrative and signs that his anti-campaign playbook campaign is working. He raised $2.4 million in the last quarter, and gets applause when he notes that was $500,000 more than Mr. Cruz took in.\n\nHe has a restless energy that has put him in 217 of Texas 254 counties, driving tens of thousands of miles, fueled by bad coffee and Hostess cupcakes that supporters bring him.\n\nImage Mr. O'Rourke's schedule for a day of campaigning.\n\nImage Mr. O'Rourke stopped at a gas station near Brenham, Texas.\n\nImage Chris Evans, Mr. O'Rourke's communications director, recorded a Facebook live video in the parking lot of their hotel in Beaumont, Texas.\n\nIn Lufkin, he was greeted with chants of \u201cBeto, Beto, Beto.\u201d His campaign took in $1,258 in checks and cash dropped into a large jar.\n\n\u201cI think he can win. I think he can inspire Texans,\u201d said Susan McCulley, adding, \u201cwe\u2019re not just mad, we\u2019re scared.\u201d\n\nAnother supporter, Ferryn Martin, said, \u201cIn 2010, the Tea Party was mad. This year, we are mad.\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke tries to tap into that emotion. He livestreams almost every aspect of his campaign \u2014 the coffees, the town halls, \u201cbowling with Beto,\u201d stops at Whataburger, the drives between stops, which often include calls to voters and activists and from his wife, Amy. Driving with his left forearm and right elbow on the steering wheel, he asked her about the science fair projects of their three children.\n\nHis theory of the case is that he can make the sale in rural Texas in part simply by showing up. If he can cut down Mr. Cruz\u2019s margins there and generate energy in urban precincts and suburbs, he can become the first Democrat since Lloyd Bentsen in 1988 to win a Texas Senate seat.\n\nDemocrats in Texas have long been saying that the demographic changes sweeping the state, fueled by a surge in the Latino population, would eventually make the state two-party competitive, but even some of the more optimistic forecasts don\u2019t have that happening until 2024. Still, there are other factors at work that add to their hopes. The number of college-educated residents in the state increased by 20 percent from 2006 to 2016, according to Lloyd Potter, the Texas state demographer. Rural areas are losing population while urban and suburban areas are gaining.\n\n\u201cIf one was able to figure out how to turn out the Latino vote and the African-American vote, that could change things pretty dramatically,\u201d Mr. Potter said. \u201cThe issue is how far-off in the horizon it is.\u201d\n\nImage Velenta Mathews-Hunter, a retired school teacher, shook hands with Mr. O'Rourke in Orange, Texas.\n\nImage A cardboard cut-out of John wayne in Robert\u2019s Restaurant and Meat Market in Orange.\n\nImage\n\nBut President Trump, who carried by stated by nine percentage points, is complicating conventional analysis. \u201cAll things being equal, if there wasn\u2019t a Trump, it would be in the mid 2020s until the state would get competitive,\u201d said Russ Tidwell, a Democratic consultant who has worked in the state for decades. \u201cBut Trump makes other things possible.\u201d\n\nAnd Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign is all about a sense of the possible.\n\nHis biography does not have any of the bootstraps appeal of a Lyndon Johnson, or even Mr. Cruz, the son of immigrant parents. Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s family was well-to-do in El Paso. Born Robert Francis O\u2019Rourke, he has been known as \u201cBeto\u201d from infancy. His voice shows no hint of a Texas accent until his says his first name and sounds like he is speaking Spanish \u2014 which he does, fluently.\n\nHe was sent to Woodberry Forest boarding school in Virginia, then Columbia, where he was captain of the crew team. He played in a punk rock band, hauled expensive art and enjoyed the wanderlust that a young man from a wealthy family can afford. He went back to El Paso and started a technology company, then ran for City Council before winning his House seat in 2012, defeating an incumbent.\n\nIn the House, he has hardly left a footprint. He did not vote for Representative Nancy Pelosi to be the Democratic leader, and Mr. O\u2019Rourke, 45, thinks his party in Congress needs fresh leaders, which is one reason he supports term limits.\n\nImage Cynthia Cano, Mr. O'Rourke's campaign logistics and events director, walk to an event in Beaumont.\n\nMr. Cruz, who did not respond to a request to discuss the race, has never been as popular as Republicans like former governors George W. Bush or Rick Perry, but he has been tactically adroit and plays well to more conservative voters. He has an uneasy alliance with Mr. Trump that started with the president calling him \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d during the primaries and has evolved into invitations to the White House.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s is an emotive approach, Mr. Cruz\u2019s one of cold-eyed precision.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he is a flash in the pan,\u201d William Martin, a scholar at the Baker Institute at Rice University said of Mr. O\u2019Rourke. \u201cHe\u2019s young and fresh, and he\u2019s just intrinsically so much more attractive than Ted Cruz for voters who don\u2019t already have their minds made up.\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke knows Mr. Cruz is a skilled debater, a proven fund-raiser and a candidate who showed in his presidential campaign that he could leverage analytics into millions of votes. And the congressman has vulnerabilities. Mr. O\u2019Rourke has been arrested twice, once for a college prank, a second time, in 1998, for what he called the \u201cunforgivably\u201d bad decision to drive after \u201chaving too much to drink.\u201d Both charges were dismissed.\n\nHis mother receives fund-raising solicitations from Mr. Cruz, who calls her son a \u201cNancy Pelosi liberal,\u201d no doubt a preview of things to come.\n\nBut Mr. O\u2019Rourke also will use Mr. Cruz\u2019s well-observed ambition against him, and said that the incumbent\u2019s real goal is another White House run. He cites a letter that Mr. Cruz sent to Gov. Kim Reynolds, Republican of Iowa, talking about visiting all of Iowa\u2019s 99 counties.\n\n\u201cI know he hasn\u2019t been to all 254 of Texas\u2019 counties,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said.\n\nImage Mr. O'Rourke at Suga's restaurant in Beaumont.\n\nImage Mr. O'Rourke's campaign buttons are designed in the likeness of Robert F. Kennedy, his political hero.\n\nImage Mr. O\u2019Rourke talked to his wife, Amy, in his hotel room in Bay City, Tex.\n\nTexas is so vast that it is nearly impossible to travel the entire state the way that Mr. O\u2019Rourke has chosen to, largely by car, over state highways and rural roads, but he seems undeterred and drives most of the miles himself, with aides in passenger seats.\n\nOver lunch at the Lufkin BBQ, Mr. O\u2019Rourke said his campaign strategy was in part drawn from the 1968 presidential campaign of his political hero, Robert F. Kennedy, long on hope and aspiration.\n\nMr. Kennedy was not driven by \u201cpolls or consultants, but he really seemed to be grounded in the things that he found important,\u201d he said, adding that he often seemed to be going directly against the advice of what was going to be popular.\n\nThose seemed to be the words of a long-shot, a candidate with nothing to lose.\n\nImage Mr. O'Rourke at an event in Woodville, Texas.\n\nSign Up for the Morning Briefing Get what you need to know to start your day in the United States, Canada and the Americas, delivered to your inbox.

What Influences a Justice\u2019s Decision Image Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, center, with President Trump and Judge Neil M. Gorsuch at the White House in April during Judge Gorsuch\u2019s swearing-in as a Supreme Court justice. If the moderate Justice Kennedy retires, Mr. Trump would be likely to replace him with a committed conservative like Justice Gorsuch. Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Supreme Court justices say they do not act politically when they decide cases. But they freely admit to taking account of politics in deciding when to retire. Most justices, for instance, try to step down under politically like-minded presidents.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not 100 percent true,\u201d Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said in 1999, six years before he died, \u201cbut it certainly is true in more cases than not.\u201d\n\nSuch political calculations are perfectly proper, he said, as \u201cdeciding when to step down from the court is not a judicial act.\u201d\n\nFor the second year in a row, rumors that Justice Anthony M. Kennedy may retire from the Supreme Court are sweeping Washington. He is 81, and he is doubtless weighing many factors in deciding whether to stay. Among them, experts in judicial behavior said, are the tug of party loyalty, the preservation of his judicial legacy and how close his retirement would be to a presidential election.\n\nJustice Kennedy has long held the decisive vote in many of the Supreme Court\u2019s most contested and consequential cases, and his retirement would give President Trump the opportunity to move the court sharply to the right. If Justice Kennedy steps down, the confirmation fight over his successor will be titanic.\n\nJustices often try to retire when the president is of the same party as the one who appointed them. Justice Kennedy was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, a Republican. President Trump may be an unconventional Republican, but he is a Republican.\n\nJustices also try to retire early in a president\u2019s term, generally in the first two years, according to a 2010 study by Ross M. Stolzenberg, a demographer at the University of Chicago, and James T. Lindgren, a law professor at Northwestern. The study considered justices who served between 1789 and 2006.\n\n\u201cIf the incumbent president is of the same party as the president who nominated the justice to the court, and if the incumbent president is in the first two years of a four-year presidential term,\u201d the study found, \u201cthen the justice has odds of resignation that are about 2.6 times higher than when these two conditions are not met.\u201d\n\nJustices also take account of who controls the Senate and its internal rules.\n\n\u201cIf I resign any time this year,\u201d Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in the fall of 2014, less than two years into President Obama\u2019s second term, \u201che could not successfully appoint anyone I would like to see in the court.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo anybody who thinks that if I step down, Obama could appoint someone like me, they\u2019re misguided,\u201d she said.\n\nArtemus Ward, the author of \u201cDeciding to Leave: The Politics of Retirement From the United States Supreme Court,\u201d said Justice Kennedy found himself at a crucial crossroads. If he wants to resign under a Republican president in the first half of a presidential term, he must act.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now or never,\u201d said Mr. Ward, a political scientist at Northern Illinois University. \u201cIt\u2019s either this year or you wait until the next election.\u201d\n\nParty loyalty is likely to overcome more subtle concerns about judicial legacy, Mr. Ward said. Justice Kennedy holds the crucial vote in many closely divided cases, and he has been drifting to the left. He has cast conservative votes in cases on campaign finance and gun rights but has lately voted with the court\u2019s liberal wing on gay rights, abortion and affirmative action.\n\nBut Mr. Ward said Justice Kennedy is likely to emulate Justice Byron R. White, who drifted to the right after his appointment by President John F. Kennedy, a Democrat. Even so, Justice White said, it was fitting to retire under a Democratic president because he had been appointed by one. He stepped down not long after President Bill Clinton was elected and was replaced by Justice Ginsburg, whose voting record has been considerably more liberal.\n\nA new study on departures from the Supreme Court attempted to refine the conventional factors by considering political science data on justices\u2019 voting patterns, involuntary departures and missed opportunities. It concluded that justices have not been particularly successful at ensuring that they would be replaced by like-minded successors.\n\nJustice Kennedy is in a ticklish spot, said the study\u2019s author, Christine Kexel Chabot, who teaches at Loyola University Chicago School of Law. He is, she wrote, a moderate conservative, and there is no reason to think a president of either party would replace him with someone similar.\n\nIn all likelihood, she wrote, Mr. Trump would appoint a committed conservative like his first nominee, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch. In the few divided cases in which Justices Kennedy and Gorsuch participated in the court\u2019s last term, they agreed just 38 percent of the time. By contrast, Justice Gorsuch agreed with Justice Clarence Thomas, the court\u2019s most conservative member, 100 percent of the time.\n\nMs. Chabot also explored justices\u2019 decisions to forgo opportunities to retire under like-minded presidents.\n\nOf the 16 justices since 1954 who reached the age 65 and had served on the court for at least 18 years, Ms. Chabot found, nine passed up politically opportune retirements, risking having to leave the court for health reasons in less attractive circumstances.\n\nTwo of them \u2014 Justices White and John Paul Stevens \u2014 retired later on. Justice Elena Kagan replaced Justice Stevens, and her voting record resembles his.\n\nAnother two, Justices Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, could have retired under President Obama but continue to serve.\n\nStaying on is understandable, Ms. Chabot wrote. \u201cRetirement from the court is very costly for a justice,\u201d she wrote, \u201cas he or she must permanently give up what is often an immensely personally rewarding position as well as the most powerful judicial office in the United States.\u201d\n\nTry as they might, Mr. Ward said, justices have had only mixed success in deciding when to step down.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t completely time their retirements perfectly because they\u2019re just like us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know when they\u2019re going to get sick, and they don\u2019t know when they\u2019re going to die, and they don\u2019t know who is going to win the next election.\u201d\n\nAs for Justice Kennedy, Ms. Chabot noted in an interview that he has hired law clerks for the term that starts in October. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he remains on the bench,\u201d she said.\n\nCorrection : An earlier version of this article misstated who replaced Justice John Paul Stevens on the Supreme Court.

{"title": "\n                    White House Seeks to Move On From Abuse Scandal. But What Did It Learn?                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/us/politics/trump-kelly-porter.html", "text": "There would be much to investigate. A few senior officials in the West Wing had access to details of the allegations of physical and emotional abuse made by Mr. Porter\u2019s ex-wives. A greater number of people had a sense that something was amiss, but chose to avert their gaze instead of asking questions.\n\nThe first hours after the issue was brought to light by an article in The Daily Mail were a confused blur, with officials like Mr. Kelly at first endorsing Mr. Porter\u2019s resignation, but then agreeing to issue statements in support of him. That disarray belied the belief of some in the White House that someone \u2014 Mr. Kelly \u2014 was finally in charge after six months of drama and infighting in 2017. In reality, these officials now concede, no one truly was.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t figured out how the place operates, and apparently they don\u2019t want to learn,\u201d said John Dean, a White House counsel under President Richard M. Nixon. The Porter situation, he added, \u201cis a manifestation of what happens when you have chaos.\u201d\n\nMr. Kelly, a four-star Marine general, had been billed as uniquely qualified to bring order to Mr. Trump\u2019s world when he took his post in July. Now he faces a morale crisis in the West Wing, where aides describe a sense of betrayal by a chief of staff they no longer trust after his claims that he had not fully known about Mr. Porter\u2019s problems and had acted within minutes once he learned of them.\n\nBut above all, White House veterans say, President Trump is responsible for the haphazard nature with which his operation has functioned, in part because he knew and cared little for the rules and norms that govern the executive branch. Unprepared to fill the ranks of a new administration, Mr. Trump never tried to set a tone of discipline or ethical rigor in his West Wing.\n\n\u201cA White House reflects the president,\u201d said William M. Daley, a chief of staff under Mr. Obama. \u201cSo he moves on to the next scandal, crisis, attack, whatever, and no self-reflection. So why should anyone be surprised that that sort of becomes the M.O., even when there\u2019s a belief that there\u2019s institutional stuff one should consider.\u201d\n\nFor 13 months, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides have approached their mercurial and process-averse boss by putting their heads down and ignoring what they could not control, avoiding information that could rattle their daily balance.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut in the case of Mr. Porter, White House aides privately acknowledge, some advisers appear to have chosen to try to protect a colleague who was generally well liked and, more important, too competent to lose. Mr. Trump himself often expressed his regard for Mr. Porter by describing him as \u201cout of central casting.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the hours after the allegations against Mr. Porter became public, some senior officials in fact hesitated to force him out, in part because they argued that if one top adviser could be felled by accusations, they could all potentially be vulnerable. Mr. Porter denied privately to his colleagues, as well as publicly, that he had ever physically abused his wives.\n\nWhat distinguished this crisis from the ones that preceded it was that it was not localized to one official, such as Stephen K. Bannon, the isolated chief strategist who left in August, or Reince Priebus, the often uninformed chief of staff who departed a month before that. Mr. Porter\u2019s case had spread to so many aspects of the White House that it ensnared a number of staff members.\n\nWhile multiple officials in the West Wing were aware that he had been unable to pass his background check, none appear to have made an effort to ascertain precisely why and take action on it. Several former White House counsels have said they would have made it their business to know if an official at Mr. Porter\u2019s level was facing allegations as serious as domestic abuse, but officials in the White House have privately maintained that Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, never did.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Bauer, a White House counsel under President Barack Obama.\n\nC. Boyden Gray, who served as White House counsel under President George Bush, said the problems might have been exacerbated by the existence of the special counsel investigation into Russian election meddling and potential Trump campaign ties to it.\n\nMr. McGahn and other senior officials may be reluctant to engage with the F.B.I. or the Justice Department on security clearances or any other matter, for fear of being drawn into the inquiry, he said. \u201cYou just didn\u2019t want to call the F.B.I. or call the D.O.J. on any subject, Russia or not,\u201d Mr. Gray said of officials in the West Wing. \u201cThat may have contributed to the breakdown here.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Mr. Trump has been in open war with the F.B.I. for months, a fact that some West Wing aides believe contributed to the debacle.\n\nThe dismissal on Wednesday of George David Banks, who was the White House point person on climate change, was seen as a particularly galling move after 13 months in which nobody in the West Wing had seemed particularly concerned about enforcing a standard for past conduct.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Banks had been told that he would not be granted a full security clearance. In an interview, he said the reason was that he had smoked marijuana a handful of times between 2010 and 2013, conduct that he said he had self-reported to the F.B.I. nearly a year ago.\n\n\u201cIt was unbelievable,\u201d Mr. Banks said of the decision to deny him a clearance, which he learned about abruptly at the end of a workday, when an official from Mr. McGahn\u2019s office and a human resources aide asked for a meeting later that evening. After informing him of their decision and allowing Mr. Banks to resign, they asked him to gather his things and escorted him from the premises.\n\nInside the West Wing, officials said, Mr. Banks is seen as collateral damage in a belated effort by Mr. Kelly and other top officials to show they are cracking down on interim security clearances.\n\nYet former White House advisers from both parties have been mystified at the ineptitude of Mr. Trump\u2019s team in dealing with the fallout from Mr. Porter\u2019s situation.\n\nPart of the problem, they argue, is a culture at the White House that does not appear to prioritize getting at the truth.\n\n\u201cThe fundamentals of Crisis Management 101 were certainly not observed here, but more importantly, there does not seem to be a priority on marshaling and disclosing the facts, whatever they may be,\u201d said Jack Quinn, who served as White House counsel under Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky affair. \u201cThey need to stop the bleeding, and I think that they\u2019ve got to understand that the bleeding is not going to stop until the full truth is told.\u201d", "keywords": ["officials", "west", "wing", "mr", "porters", "learn", "counsel", "trump", "scandal", "abuse", "house", "white", "seeks", "president"], "polarity": 0.06546208192247795, "subjectivity": 0.3426424785335676},

President Trump then cited him. We fact-checked Mr. Goldman.\n\nImage President Trump cited tweets by Rob Goldman as proof that Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign was about something other than giving him an election victory. Credit Tom Brenner/The New York Times\n\nRob Goldman, vice president for ads at Facebook, posted an eight-part thread on Twitter late Friday about his company\u2019s role in Russian disinformation \u2014 and quickly caused a firestorm.\n\nIn his messages, Mr. Goldman discussed the indictment of 13 Russians and three companies accused of carrying out a scheme to subvert the 2016 election. Facebook was frequently mentioned in the indictment as the main tech tool that the Russians had used to tilt the election in favor of Donald J. Trump.\n\nMr. Goldman defended Facebook in his tweets, saying that the Russian-bought ads on the social network were not primarily aimed at swaying the vote result. His posts went viral on Saturday when President Trump cited them as proof that Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign was about something other than giving him an election victory.\n\nThe Fake News Media never fails. Hard to ignore this fact from the Vice President of Facebook Ads, Rob Goldman! https://t.co/XGC7ynZwYJ \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2018\n\nWe fact-checked Mr. Goldman\u2019s eight tweets. Here\u2019s what we found.\n\n\u201cWe shared Russian ads with Congress, Mueller and the American people to help the public understand how the Russians abused our system.\u201d Tweet #1\n\nPartly true.\n\nWhen the Russians\u2019 use of Facebook to influence the 2016 election became public last year, the company said it was sharing the Russian-bought ads with Congress and Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel leading the investigation.\n\nBut Facebook did not directly share the ads with the American people. Instead, the House Intelligence Committee released examples of the ads ahead of congressional hearings last November.\n\n\u201cI have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal.\u201d Tweet #2\n\nNot according to the indictment.\n\nThe grand jury indictment secured by Mr. Mueller asserts that the goal of Russian operatives was to influence the 2016 election, particularly by criticizing Hillary Clinton and supporting Mr. Trump and Bernie Sanders, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s chief rival for the Democratic nomination.\n\nThe Russians \u201cengaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump,\u201d the indictment said.\n\nMr. Goldman later wrote in another tweet that \u201cthe Russian campaign was certainly in favor of Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe majority of the Russian ad spend happened AFTER the election.\u201d Tweet #3\n\nTrue, but here is some context.\n\nAccording to figures published by Facebook last October, 44 percent of the Russian-bought ads were displayed before the 2016 election, while 56 percent were shown afterward. Mr. Goldman asserted that those figures were not published by the \u201cmainstream media\u201d \u2014 however, many mainstream news outlets did print those numbers, including CNN, Reuters and The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cThe main goal of the Russian propaganda and misinformation effort is to divide America by using our institutions, like free speech and social media, against us.\u201d Tweet #4\n\nNot exactly.\n\nThe indictment does show that Russian operatives used social media \u2014 particularly Facebook \u2014 to try to sow division among Americans. But to reiterate, the indictment said that the Russians\u2019 goal was to sway the 2016 election toward a particular outcome. That aim was pursued not just through ads, which Mr. Goldman focuses on, but through Facebook pages, groups and events.\n\n\u201cThe single best demonstration of Russia\u2019s true motives is the Houston anti-islamic protest. Americans were literally puppeted into the streets by trolls who organized both the sides of protest.\u201d Tweet #5\n\nThis needs context.\n\nThe protests in Houston in May 2016 were among many rallies organized by Russian operatives through Facebook. While the Houston protest was anti-Islamic, as Mr. Goldman said, he failed to note that the goal in promoting the demonstration was to link Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign with a pro-Islamic message.\n\nAccording to the indictment secured by Mr. Mueller, there were many other examples of Russian operatives using Facebook and Instagram to organize pro-Trump rallies. At one protest, the Russian operatives paid for a cage to be built, in which an actress dressed as Mrs. Clinton posed in a prison uniform.\n\n\u201cThe Russian campaign is ongoing. Just last week saw news that Russian spies attempted to sell a fake video of Trump with a hooker to the NSA.\u201d Tweet #6\n\nTrue.\n\nAmerican intelligence officials have said that Russia has continued to target the American public and that it is already meddling in the 2018 midterm elections. The New York Times also reported this month on an attempt by a shadowy Russian figure to sell stolen American cyberweapons, as well as compromising material on President Trump, to the United States.\n\n\u201cThere are easy ways to fight this. Disinformation is ineffective against a well educated citizenry. Finland, Sweden and Holland have all taught digital literacy and critical thinking about misinformation to great effect.\u201d Tweet #7\n\nNot exactly.\n\nWhile Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands have all made efforts to teach digital literacy, those countries are still grappling with how to handle misinformation. A recent survey in Finland found that 67 percent of respondents \u201cthink fake news affects Finns\u2019 perceptions on issues \u2018a lot\u2019 or to an \u2018extreme\u2019 degree.\u201d Officials in Sweden and the Netherlands have also recently warned that fake news poses a threat to their governments.\n\n\u201cWe are also taking aggressive steps to prevent this sort of meddling in the future by requiring verification of political advertisers and by making all ads on the platform visible to anyone who cares to examine them.\u201d Tweet #8\n\nTrue.\n\nAfter initially dismissing concerns that it influenced the 2016 election, Facebook has announced a series of moves to prevent its future misuse. One of those steps includes verifying political advertisers through a system that combines automated and human fact checkers. The company has also said it plans to use postcards sent by regular mail to verify the identities of American political advertisers. Whether these new measures will be effective is unclear.\n\nCorrection : Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the month when protests organized by Russian operatives were held in Houston.

{"title": "\n                    Indictment Leaves No Doubt: Russia Backed Trump. But Was It the Difference?                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/18/us/politics/trump-election-russia.html", "text": "The dispute is especially raw because of the razor-thin margin in the election and the uncertainty over what exactly tipped the balance. Mrs. Clinton, who handily won the national popular vote, lost the Electoral College vote and therefore the presidency because Mr. Trump defeated her by less than a combined 80,000 votes in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nFew Democrats believe that Mr. Trump won solely as a result of Russia\u2019s intervention. But many think the meddling exacerbated Mrs. Clinton\u2019s challenges, making her more vulnerable to what some believe was the decisive blow: the announcement by James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director at the time, just over a week before the election that he was reopening the investigation into her use of a private email server.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cRussia succeeded in weakening her enough so that the Comey letter could knock her off,\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, who was Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign communications director.\n\nBut veterans of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign shake their head at what they believe is an abiding sense of denial among Clinton loyalists over her deficiencies.\n\n\u201cThe election was still won because Donald Trump was a better candidate with a superior message taking on a horrible candidate who people thought was corrupt,\u201d said David Bossie, a senior Trump strategist who is now president of the conservative lobbying group Citizens United. He allowed that Moscow had mounted a \u201cmalicious, disruptive campaign.\u201d\n\nNo single factor was determinative in an election that brought nearly 140 million Americans to the polls. And the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies say they do not have any way to calculate whether the Russian effort swung the election.\n\n\u201cTo credit the victory to anyone else including those 13 Russians is to demean everyday Americans\u2019 power to control their own destiny,\u201d said Stephen K. Bannon, the Trump campaign chief executive, who reportedly spent 20 hours with the team led by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in the Russia investigation, last week. \u201cThe \u2018deplorables\u2019 deserve better.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet it is difficult for Republicans to contend that the multimillion-dollar Russian intervention had no impact, with 126 million Americans being exposed to Russian-sponsored posts on Facebook alone.\n\nThe interference was not limited to the actions laid out by Mr. Mueller in the indictment of the 13 Russians linked to a \u201ctroll farm\u201d known as the Internet Research Agency.\n\nAccording to the intelligence community, the Russian government supported the email hacking of the Democratic National Committee and the personal account of John D. Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, as well as the disclosure of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s paid speeches. The committee emails, leaked just before the Democratic National Convention, helped increase the rancor between supporters of Mrs. Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nAnd the Podesta emails, leaked slowly over the month of October, were doled out selectively, with a number of exchanges held back, according to two Clinton campaign officials. While there were plenty of anodyne messages in the trove, the hackers made sure to reveal the messages that maximized the appearance of D.N.C. behavior unfairly favoring Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nFurther, a major factor in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s loss of the three crucial Rust Belt states, which every Democratic nominee had carried since 1992, was a drop-off in turnout and the performance of third-party candidates.\n\nShe could not match former President Barack Obama\u2019s turnout among blacks in cities like Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee, and the Green Party nominee, Jill Stein, captured enough votes to make up the difference between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It says that they funded social media posts that were explicitly aimed at encouraging \u201cU.S. minority groups not to vote in the 2016 U.S. presidential election or to vote for a third-party U.S. presidential candidate.\u201d\n\nFor example, the Russians created an Instagram account, \u201cWoke Blacks,\u201d and posted messages urging African-Americans not to vote at all rather than support \u201cthe lesser of two devils.\u201d They also purchased an ad on Instagram to promote a post that read: \u201cChoose peace and vote for Jill Stein. Trust me, it\u2019s not a wasted vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Stein vote alone clearly diminished Clinton\u2019s vote and some of the vote that might have gone to us in Milwaukee and stayed home was probably discouraged, and this Russia stuff played a role in that discouragement,\u201d said Paul Maslin, a Democratic pollster based in Wisconsin. \u201cOut of the 10 factors that most caused Trump to win, maybe this was only the seventh, but the fact that this is even on a relatively short list ought to be alarming.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, Republicans and even some Democrats note that the Russian meddling may not have mattered at all if Mrs. Clinton had run a better campaign. She ventured twice to Ohio in the final days of the campaign \u2014 a state she would lose by eight points \u2014 but never set foot in Wisconsin during the general election, and she made a few strategic errors in Michigan.\n\nDespite pleas from Michigan officials, her national campaign did not ask Mr. Obama to visit the state until the last day of the campaign \u2014 and it was forced to dispatch him to Ann Arbor to rally college students rather than sending him to Detroit, because a police funeral was scheduled in the city.\n\nAnd when Mrs. Clinton visited Michigan in the last days of the election, she spent some of her time in the deeply conservative and religious western part of the state trying to win over Republicans who were thought to be uneasy with Mr. Trump on moral grounds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d said Representative Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who pleaded with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign to devote more attention to the state. \u201cThe Russians clearly did things that made their way into Michigan. At the same time, as Democrats, if we\u2019re not talking about issues that matter to people, then we\u2019re not connecting with our base either.\u201d\n\nStu Sandler, a Michigan Republican strategist, was blunter: \u201cClinton didn\u2019t do enough in inner-city Detroit, and that was noticed by a lot of Democrats here.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton did spend considerable time in Pennsylvania, but she suffered there from what plagued her in the other parts of the industrial Midwest: Too many black voters stayed home, a slice of white liberals voted third-party, and many of the working-class whites who had backed Mr. Obama swung to Mr. Trump.\n\nHer environmental and gun-control policies turned off some of the state\u2019s ancestral Democrats, and the views she and her husband held in the 1990s on criminal justice depressed black turnout.\n\n\u201cShe was very unpopular here, so she didn\u2019t motivate the Democrats,\u201d said Rob Gleason, who was the state Republican chairman in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo Democrats, though, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s shortcomings were precisely what Russia preyed on to undercut her campaign.\n\n\u201cWe will never be able to know for certain if the massive Russian operation was the difference between victory and defeat,\u201d said Representative Brendan F. Boyle of Pennsylvania. \u201cBut there is one thing we absolutely can say with certainty: It was a factor. The Russians wouldn\u2019t have devoted hundreds of people and tens of millions of dollars on this operation if it wasn\u2019t having an effect.\u201d\n\nEven as Mr. Trump polarizes the country, both his admirers and detractors found themselves in agreement with one of his many Twitter observations on Sunday: that the Russians intended to sow chaos, and \u201chave succeeded beyond their wildest dreams.\u201d", "keywords": ["michigan", "campaign", "leaves", "trump", "mr", "vote", "russia", "clinton", "mrs", "doubt", "backed", "clintons", "election", "indictment", "russians", "difference"], "polarity": 0.06753924267222139, "subjectivity": 0.4347604818349497},

Mr. Cohen was not representing anyone in the confidential agreement, but he was apprised of it by Ms. McDougal\u2019s lawyer, and earlier had been made aware of her attempt to tell her story by the media company, according to interviews and an email reviewed by The New York Times.\n\nPhoto\n\nTwo months later, Mr. Cohen played a direct role in a similar deal involving an adult film star, Stephanie Clifford, who used the stage name Stormy Daniels, and who once said she had had an affair with Mr. Trump. Last week, Mr. Cohen said he used his own money for the $130,000 payment to her, which has prompted a complaint alleging that Mr. Cohen violated campaign finance regulations. Legal experts also have noted that the payment on behalf of his client may have violated New York\u2019s ethics rules.\n\nMr. Cohen, who is still described as Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer although he is no longer on the Trump Organization payroll, has denied any wrongdoing and insists the arrangement was legal. In an interview, he disputed details of some of his other activities that were described to The Times. But he has never shied away from his role as Mr. Trump\u2019s loyal defender. \u201cIt is not like I just work for Mr. Trump,\u201d Mr. Cohen said in an interview in 2016. \u201cI am his friend, and I would do just about anything for him and also his family.\u201d\n\nAn examination of the efforts to shield Mr. Trump from aspects of his own past shows how Mr. Cohen maneuvered in the pay-to-play gossip world \u2014 populated by porn stars and centerfold models, tabloid editors and lawyers with B- and C-list entertainment clients \u2014 that came to unusual prominence in an American presidential election.\n\nMr. Cohen exploited mutual-self interest. By heading off trouble involving Mr. Trump\u2019s history with women, he accrued loyalty points, the ultimate currency with Mr. Trump. He dealt with lawyers who could win fat cuts of any settlements women might reach with American Media or with Mr. Trump.\n\nAt least two women got money and, in Ms. McDougal\u2019s case, a promise of favorable attention in American Media publications, which include The National Enquirer, Star, Us Weekly and Radar. Mr. Trump, of course, benefited the most: avoiding more scrutiny as he struggled to dismiss multiple allegations of groping and unwanted advances that arose during the campaign.\n\nOne American Media executive, in a 2016 interview, said that the priority was that nothing embarrassing come out. But in the gossip economy, secrets last only as long as the incentives to keep them do.\n\nPhoto\n\nRisqu\u00e9 Photos\n\nIt was July 2015 when Mr. Cohen received a phone call from Jeremy Frommer, a hedge-fund manager turned digital entrepreneur, who had obtained photos of Mr. Trump appearing to autograph the breasts of a topless woman from the estate of Bob Guccione, the founder of Penthouse magazine. Mr. Cohen was not pleased.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe was in a rage,\u201d Mr. Frommer said in an interview. \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018If you show those photos, I\u2019m gonna take you down.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt was the rough talk of a Long Island native who started his career juggling work as a personal injury lawyer and taxi fleet manager and met Mr. Trump after acquiring units in Trump buildings.\n\nAfter Mr. Cohen joined the Trump Organization in 2006, the role that Mr. Trump wanted him to play was clear: a combination of aggressive spokesman and lieutenant who would take on the real estate mogul\u2019s antagonists. It was a job Roy Cohn, a New York lawyer best known for advising Senator Joseph McCarthy, had done decades earlier for Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen\u2019s work for his boss was often a mystery even to others in his office, but his devotion was clear.\n\nIn talking with Mr. Cohen, Mr. Frommer mentioned Mr. Pecker. Years earlier, Mr. Frommer had sold American Media the exclusive rights to a suggestive photograph of Arnold Schwarzenegger \u2014 which it did not publish \u2014 and he knew the company\u2019s chief executive.\n\nMr. Frommer recalled Mr. Cohen\u2019s saying, \u201cYeah, I know Pecker.\u201d Mr. Frommer added, \u201cThat\u2019s where the conversation calmed down.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Pecker and Mr. Trump, a staple of the American gossip media since the 1980s, have a friendship that goes back decades. The relationship benefited Mr. Trump throughout the campaign as The Enquirer lionized him and hammered rivals like Ted Cruz, Ben Carson and, finally, Hillary Clinton.\n\nMr. Cohen formed his own bond with Mr. Pecker, keeping in touch with him and Dylan Howard, a top executive, throughout the campaign.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmerican Media acknowledged those ties, saying in a statement, \u201cMichael Cohen and President Trump have been personal friends of Mr. Pecker\u2019s for decades.\u201d But, it said, neither of them \u201cnor any other individual has attempted to, or ever, influenced (or will ever influence) coverage at A.M.I.\u2019s publications. Period.\u201d\n\nAfter the initial blowup, Mr. Frommer said, he and Mr. Cohen quickly agreed that Mr. Frommer would take the Trump photos to Mr. Pecker. The men soon began discussing potential business deals, including an interview with Mr. Trump as part of a joint project between American Media and Mr. Frommer\u2019s company, Jerrick Media, according to text messages and emails reviewed by The Times.\n\n\u201cSpoke to Cohen we are set. Well done!\u201d Mr. Pecker told Mr. Frommer in a July 2015 text exchange.\n\nTwo months later, when Mr. Frommer expressed doubt that the Trump interview would take place, Mr. Cohen responded in an Oct. 5 email: \u201cNo no \u2026 relax. I am on it and will make it happen.\u201d\n\nGot a confidential news tip? Do you have the next big story? Want to share it with The New York Times? We offer several ways to get in touch with and provide materials to our journalists.\n\nMr. Frommer said he had assured Mr. Cohen at the time that he wouldn\u2019t make the photos public \u2014 \u201cI said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to publish them\u2019\u201d \u2014 but that the decision had nothing to do with the business talks.\n\nIn the end, American Media concluded that the photos were of little value. The interview and the deals never materialized for Mr. Frommer, who went on to publish one of the Trump photos on his own website.\n\nAmerican Media said in a statement that it had no interest in suppressing the photographs. But in early 2016, an American Media executive, speaking only on condition of anonymity in discussing internal company thinking, said that when the negotiations between A.M.I. and Mr. Frommer began, they were intended to suppress the photos, part of broader efforts by American Media to \u201ccatch and kill\u201d information that would damage Mr. Trump.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It was also where people looking to sell potentially damaging information about Mr. Trump were likely to turn.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the summer of 2016, American Media came to Mr. Cohen with a story involving Ms. McDougal, the former Playboy Playmate. She claimed to have had a consensual affair with Mr. Trump in the mid-2000s, early in his marriage to Melania Trump. Mr. Trump denies an affair.\n\nMs. McDougal had retained Keith Davidson, a Hollywood lawyer, who reached out to contacts at American Media. After negotiating on and off for a couple of months, A.M.I. agreed to give Ms. McDougal $150,000 for the exclusive rights to her story, along with promises of publicity and marketing opportunities through its fitness magazines. The contract did not identify Mr. Trump, but required her to keep quiet about any relationship with a married man.\n\nA.M.I. had shared her allegations with Mr. Cohen, though it said it did so only as it worked to corroborate her claims, which it said it ultimately could not do. But that was not the only heads-up Mr. Cohen received.\n\nSoon after Ms. McDougal signed the confidential agreement on Aug. 5, 2016, Mr. Davidson emailed Mr. Cohen, \u201cMichael, please give me a call at your convenience.\u201d Mr. Davidson followed up by explaining to Mr. Cohen over the phone that the McDougal transaction had been completed, according to a person familiar with the conversation. Mr. Cohen said, \u201cI don\u2019t recall those communications.\u201d\n\nMr. Davidson acknowledged the public\u2019s interest in Ms. Clifford\u2019s and Ms. McDougal\u2019s stories, but said that he was \u201cnot at liberty to discuss private client information.\u201d\n\nIn the months after Ms. McDougal\u2019s agreement with A.M.I., Mr. Trump\u2019s relationships with women drew more scrutiny on the campaign trail. The release of an audio recording that captured the candidate bragging about grabbing women\u2019s genitals inspired numerous women to step forward with allegations that he had groped or kissed them against their will.\n\nPhoto\n\nAccording to people in contact with her at the time, Ms. McDougal expressed frustration with what she viewed as foot-dragging by A.M.I. in fulfilling commitments made in her contract and with Mr. Davidson\u2019s lackluster response to her. She reached out to a prominent First Amendment lawyer, Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., who had made a public pledge in October 2016 to defend anyone threatened with legal action by Mr. Trump for making allegations against him. Mr. Boutrous briefly represented Ms. McDougal, focusing primarily on her restrictive contract with A.M.I., which in late November 2016 agreed she could respond to \u201clegitimate\u201d press inquiries about the alleged affair.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. McDougal\u2019s story eventually became public, in a Wall Street Journal article published days before the election. The New Yorker published new details, including an interview with her, last week.\n\nQuelling a Storm\n\nOver the years Mr. Cohen had come to know Ms. McDougal\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Davidson, well enough that when New York magazine profiled Mr. Davidson last week, Mr. Cohen offered an enthusiastic endorsement: \u201cHe has always been professional, ethical and a true gentleman.\u201d (The California State Bar suspended Mr. Davidson\u2019s law license for 90 days in 2010, for four counts of misconduct.)\n\nMr. Davidson\u2019s client list had included the professional athletes Jalen Rose and Manny Pacquiao, as well as gossip-page regulars who placed him in the middle of the sex-tape cases of the \u201cAustin Powers\u201d actor Verne Troyer, the wrestler Hulk Hogan and the onetime Playboy model and MTV host Tila Tequila. He was a natural choice for Ms. Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, when she sought to sell her own Trump story.\n\nShe was alleging that she had had a consensual sexual relationship with Mr. Trump after they met at a celebrity golf tournament about 10 years earlier (Mr. Trump denies her claims).\n\nJust two months after Ms. McDougal\u2019s story was effectively muted by her contract with American Media, Mr. Davidson set about brokering the silence of the adult film actress. This time, the negotiator on the other end of the transaction was Mr. Cohen.\n\nThe actress agreed to a $130,000 settlement in mid-October 2016 in exchange for keeping quiet, according to contracts seen by The Times and people familiar with the matter. To make the payment, Mr. Cohen created a Delaware limited liability company called Essential Consultants, news of which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal last month, and he claimed in a statement first released to The Times last week that the money came from his own pocket.\n\nMs. Clifford has suggested in recent days that she believes Mr. Cohen has breached that agreement and that she is preparing to speak out. In 2011, she had told her story about Mr. Trump to two gossip publications. One of them, In Touch magazine, did not publish the story after Mr. Cohen warned that he would pursue aggressive legal action, The Associated Press reported last month.\n\nThe other outlet, The Dirty, took down a brief story after Mr. Davidson threatened legal action just a day after his client had provided information to the website, according to Nik Richie, The Dirty\u2019s founder, and a letter seen by The Times.\n\nAfter the deal between Ms. McDougal and A.M.I. was completed, Mr. Davidson regularly exchanged emails, text messages and calls with Mr. Cohen, according to people familiar with the contacts, including last week, when Mr. Davidson publicly bolstered Mr. Cohen\u2019s statement that he had paid Ms. Clifford himself.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Cohen went on to steer a new client to Mr. Davidson, Chuck LaBella, a former NBC executive who worked closely with Mr. Trump on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d and the \u201cMiss USA\u201d pageant. Mr. LaBella had become the object of an intense Twitter campaign \u2014 led by the comedian and ardent Trump critic Tom Arnold \u2014 calling upon him to share anything he might know about misbehavior by Mr. Trump. He became a client of Mr. Davidson last fall, according to people familiar with the arrangement.", "keywords": ["intimidation", "cohen", "trumps", "payouts", "mr", "trump", "media", "ms", "fixer", "frommer", "photos", "davidson", "tools", "american", "tabloids", "mcdougal"], "polarity": 0.09627945444706808, "subjectivity": 0.3578314204734663},
{"title": "\n                    1.5 Million Retirees Await Congressional Fix for a Pension Time Bomb                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/18/business/multiemployer-pension-crisis.html", "text": "Pension plans across the nation are facing shortfalls, with both corporate plans and those for public employees like teachers and firefighters owing more to retirees than the investment funds can possibly pay. But the looming collapse of the multiemployer pension system is significant given the sheer number of people affected and the potential for a devastating economic ripple effect: retirees losing the pension checks that keep them afloat and a potential wave of bankruptcies among the companies that once employed those workers.\n\nThe situation has been brewing since the 2008 financial crisis, as investments plummeted, leaving many plans in the red. The slow economic recovery and recent stock market rally have not been sufficient to reinvigorate the plans, which are jointly funded by labor unions and employers whose workers participate in them.\n\nAccording to Boston College\u2019s Center for Retirement Research, the nation\u2019s 1,400 multiemployer plans are facing a $553 billion \u201chole\u201d of unfunded liabilities, meaning they don\u2019t have sufficient assets to cover what they owe workers. About a fourth of these plans are in the so-called \u201cred zone,\u201d where insolvency is more imminent, potentially within the next 10 to 20 years. Most of the participants in these plans work in the transportation, services and manufacturing industries. Their employers, many of which have been trying to withdraw from the plans, include companies like United Parcel Service and Kroger.\n\nU.P.S. said in 2016 that it could be responsible for nearly $4 billion in benefits payments if the Central States Pension Fund, the largest multiemployer plan facing insolvency, slashes benefits to retirees or becomes insolvent. In the past year, U.P.S., which participates in more than two dozen pension plans, has been working with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to help develop pension legislation. It has also offered its own proposals.\n\n\u201cWe want the system stabilized and fixed in the long term because we\u2019re in so many plans and we have a lot of employees in the plans,\u201d said Chris Langan, vice president of finance at U.P.S. \u201cIt\u2019s something that is not wise to wait on.\u201d\n\nNow, Congress must decide whether to rescue these funds with low-cost loans, force them to cut benefit payments or let the funds go bankrupt and wipe out retirees\u2019 entire pensions.\n\nMs. Wong and other advocates of congressional action say they are optimistic that the committee can achieve rare bipartisan success. Members of Congress across the aisle, they say, are coming to grips with the cost of doing nothing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis committee forces Congress to get serious,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, a longtime champion of unions who represents many retirees covered by the pension plans, and who fought for the committee\u2019s creation in the spending bill. \u201cIt forces us to come together and work out differences.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe strain on the multiemployer pension system carries another risk \u2014 the potential annihilation of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the government agency that insures pension plans. The P.B.G.C. said in its latest annual report that its multiemployer program is likely to run out of money by the end of fiscal year 2025 because of the \u201crapid decline\u201d in the P.B.G.C.\u2019s financial position. In 2017, the agency paid $141 million in financial assistance to 72 multiemployer pension plans and that number is expected to rise as more plans collapse.\n\nIf the multiemployer pension plans go broke, the federal safety net created to protect retirees will not have enough money to make good on the promised benefits, leaving workers with little to no retirement benefits.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an urgent problem that needs to be fixed,\u201d said Alicia H. Munnell, a management professor at Boston College and the director of its Center for Retirement Research. \u201cUnfortunately there\u2019s an ideological divide \u2014 do you bail these people out or not?\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Retirees, already squeezed by living on a fixed income, are frustrated at the prospect of seeing their benefits reduced or eliminated if Congress does not act, he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they understand, when they take money away from us, how much they\u2019re going to hurt the economy.\u201d\n\nMr. Walden called the creation of the committee a \u201cmeaningful step\u201d to soothe nervous retirees. \u201cIt\u2019s been way too long \u2014 just talk, talk, talk, talk,\u201d he said.\n\nTo succeed, the committee must navigate Washington\u2019s aversion to anything that resembles a bailout, particularly as the government is running large deficits that are projected to grow $7 trillion over the next decade \u2014 and when many Republicans see unions as political enemies.\n\nAnd Congress has already tried to help these plans, with little success. In 2014, the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act was enacted to help funds develop rescue plans, including by reducing benefits to retirees. In 2015, Central States submitted such a plan to the Treasury Department, but it was rejected the following year on the grounds that the proposed benefit reductions were unlikely to help the fund avoid insolvency.\n\nMr. Brown and Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, a Democrat, have pushed an effort that would attempt to stabilize plans with 30-year loans from the Treasury Department, as long as plan managers could demonstrate the money would put them on a path to solvency \u2014 and not invest it in risky assets. Fiscal hawks, like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, warn that the bill could leave taxpayers responsible for as much as $100 billion if the loans are not repaid. Backers of the bill say taxpayers should not end up paying a dime.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis is beyond party affiliation, this really cuts to the root of what retirement is going to look like,\u201d said Mr. Neal, who will be a member of the special committee and has been working to recruit more House Republicans to support his proposal.\n\nMr. Neal has six Republican co-sponsors on his bill and said that several others have expressed support. A handful of Republican senators have also been engaged on the issue, including Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, who said this month that she was pleased the spending bill \u201crecognizes the urgent need to help tens of thousands of retired coal miners.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has been largely quiet on the situation, but when asked about it at a congressional hearing last week, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, noted that it was a \u201csignificant\u201d issue and promised to offer technical assistance to support any solution that lawmakers find.\n\nAs congressional negotiators homed in on a spending deal early this year, Mr. Brown pushed Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, to attach his pension language to the larger budget agreement. The bill establishes a process to ensure that if the commission produces a bill supported by a majority of its Democratic and Republican members, the Senate will vote on that bill before a new Congress convenes next year.\n\nIf concern over retirees is not enough to get lawmakers to act, those who represent pension funds hope that concern about the broader economy will. Michael D. Scott, executive director for the National Coordinating Committee for Multiemployer Plans, projects that if all of the pension plans that are in \u201ccritical\u201d and \u201ccritical and declining\u201d condition go broke, the federal government would face a half trillion dollars in lost tax revenue over the next decade because of the taxes that the active funds currently pay.\n\n\u201cI think ultimately the government is going to look at how much tax revenue it is going to lose without a solution,\u201d Mr. Scott said.", "keywords": ["help", "multiemployer", "funds", "await", "retirement", "plans", "bill", "million", "fix", "committee", "congress", "15", "bomb", "retirees", "pension", "congressional"], "polarity": 0.08310142238713669, "subjectivity": 0.40176735466914026},

That became a laughing point, not a talking point, a laughing point.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Time magazine that December, Mr. Trump, then the president-elect, rejected the notion of Russian interference, even as he entertained the possibility but then suggested other culprits:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe they interfered. That became a laughing point, not a talking point, a laughing point. Anytime I do something, they say, \u2018Oh, Russia interfered.\u2019 Why not get along with Russia?

The official said these random comments, as he described them, reflected a lack of understanding by the White House of the European project, and he put them down to Mr. Trump\u2019s long-held belief that America\u2019s allies take advantage of the United States on trade.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Nicholas Burns, a former American ambassador to NATO now at Harvard, said, \u201cIt is a mistake for the U.S. to make this an issue.\u201d\n\nThe real task is getting Europeans to spend more efficiently and usefully on defense, he said, given the threats from Russia. \u201cBut the E.U. is incapable of creating a competitive structure to NATO,\u201d he added.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis conference of trans-Atlantic security experts is the best place for Washington to reassure European allies and send them messages, as Vice President Mike Pence did last year, asserting Mr. Trump\u2019s support for NATO and the principle of collective defense, analysts say.\n\nBut this year, only Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, spoke for the administration, and he said little about Europe. Mr. Mattis and the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, did not speak publicly at all.\n\nFor many years, long before Mr. Trump\u2019s election, the United States pushed European nations to spend more on defense and to take more responsibility for European security. Mr. Trump has ratcheted up the public pressure, and NATO members are now spending more in real terms. By 2024, NATO says, at least 15 of its 29 member nations are expected to hit the collective goal of spending at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense.\n\nThat would be short of the goal of all members spending 2 percent, but it represents significant progress, especially if the money is spent more efficiently and cooperatively.\n\nTo that end, the Obama administration had urged Europe to take more responsibility for itself, with the former assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, Victoria Nuland, saying that the problem was not a strong Europe but a weak one.\n\nBut now, said Ivo Daalder, another former American ambassador to NATO, who now directs the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, the United States is going back to the language of the late 1990s, after Britain and France began a formal defense cooperation. Washington and the Secretary of State at the time, Madeleine Albright, had warned of the \u201cthree D\u2019s\u201d \u2014 the dangers of \u201cdelinking\u201d European efforts from NATO, \u201cduplicating\u201d existing efforts, and \u201cdiscriminating\u201d against nations that are not members of the European Union.\n\nMr. Daalder said that the failure to deliver a clear American message of support for Europe was a mistake. The United States should have welcomed the European initiative and increased spending as \u201ca plus for burden sharing\u201d instead of creating friction, he said.\n\n\u201cBut President Trump and his administration have made it clear that they see a world of competitors, not allies,\u201d Mr. Daalder said. \u201cThey have made it clear they don\u2019t want a strong Europe, but see Europe as a competitor, which can only please Russia.\u201d\n\nThe traditional strength of the United States is that it has allies, Mr. Daalder said, \u201cwhile Russia and China have clients.\u201d", "keywords": ["members", "concerns", "rattling", "europe", "european", "mr", "security", "allies", "plans", "nato", "revives", "american", "defense", "united", "states"], "polarity": 0.05922682337156022, "subjectivity": 0.3118082453608769},

Andrew M. Cuomo has said. \u201cThat is one of the first places I would look to reduce congestion and to raise money.\u201d\n\nEven as President Trump promotes a plan to rebuild the country\u2019s tattered infrastructure, many local governments are not waiting to see what, if any, help Washington provides and are finding novel ways to pay for transportation and other public works projects.\n\nAcross the nation, more than a dozen states and municipalities have imposed fees or taxes on ride-hailing companies or their passengers, or sometimes both, and many more are considering such measures, according to transportation and tax experts. Advocates for the charges contend that the ride-hailing cars should pay for using public streets and resources, contributing to gridlock and pollution, and siphoning passengers and fares from public transit.\n\n\u201cIf they want to share the pie, then they have to pay the price,\u201d said Fayez Khozindar, the executive director of the United Taxidrivers Community Council, an advocacy group for taxi drivers in Chicago. \u201cIt\u2019s fair because we know the city is short on funds and they want to fill the hole.\u201d\n\nBut some drivers and passengers for the ride-hailing companies say they have been unfairly singled out \u2014 in many places the new fees do not apply to taxis.\n\n\u201cUber and Lyft have always been an easy target for cities looking for new streams of revenue,\u201d said Harry Campbell, a driver for Uber and Lyft in California who writes a popular blog, The Rideshare Guy.\n\nIn New York and Chicago, Uber and Lyft have said they see their services as complementing the public transit systems and providing another option for riders, especially in transit deserts with few bus routes and train lines. Uber supports a congestion plan for Manhattan \u2014 even running an ad campaign backing the idea \u2014 as long as it does not single out for-hire vehicles.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cA comprehensive congestion pricing plan that is applied to all vehicles in the central business district is the best way to fully fund mass transit, reduce congestion and improve transportation for outer borough New Yorkers,\u201d an Uber spokeswoman, Alix Anfang, said. \u201cA surcharge alone will not accomplish these goals.\u201d\n\nLast year, New York State approved a 4 percent assessment on ride-hailing trips that begin outside New York City (rides in the city are already subject to state and local taxes). It is expected to raise $24 million a year for the state\u2019s general fund though one state legislator, Senator John E. Brooks, a Democrat from Long Island, has proposed legislation to direct that revenue to local bus and commuter rail services. \u201cWe need to think creatively and outside of the box in order to improve funding for local transit,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new fees and taxes are often part of broader regulatory measures as states and localities scramble to update tax codes and laws that have not kept up with the proliferation of app-based ride services. For instance, a Georgia state tax applies to rides in taxis but not ride-hailing cars even though they essentially do the same thing, said Carl Davis, research director for the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy in Washington.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cA lot of tax codes weren\u2019t set up to take them into account,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cThey\u2019re so new they didn\u2019t even exist a decade ago. It\u2019s an emerging tax issue, and states and localities are playing catch up.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina added a 1 percent fee to ride-hailing trips in 2015, in part to establish a single regulatory framework and block local efforts to charge prohibitively high fees to keep them out, state officials said. Now that fee has become a source of extra cash. The city of North Charleston, for instance, receives more than $30,000 annually and uses it for municipal operations.\n\nIn Oregon, Portland officials initially barred Uber but eventually agreed to allow it and Lyft to operate through pilot programs. In 2016, the city sought to create a single standard for taxis and ride-hailing cars and assessed a 50-cent ride fee on both of them, which is paid by passengers.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The fee \u201chasn\u2019t been a barrier to the riders at all as the ride-hailing services have continued to expand,\u2019\u2019 said Dave Benson, a senior manager for the Portland Bureau of Transportation. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the top yet.\u2019\u2019\n\nStill, many Portland taxi owners and drivers say the fee has hurt them more than their rivals. Noah Ernst, a superintendent for Radio Cab, said many taxi drivers feel the 50-cent fee means a smaller tip because passengers lump everything together when they pay. Taxi companies also face the headache of trying to collect the fee from drivers.\n\nHe added that taxis continued to face more stringent safety, equipment and insurance requirements, and were targeted more often for inspections because their cars were easily identified by company colors and logos.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an equal playing field at all and we were trying to tell them this the entire time they were rewriting the code,\u201d he said.\n\nAs a result, he said, taxi companies are struggling and at least two have gone out of business. His company, Radio Cab, has lost more than a third of its business since 2015.\n\nChicago officials have calculated that ride-hailing companies have cost the city about $40 million a year in lost revenue from transit fares, parking fees, licenses and permits. In 2014, the city imposed a 20-cent fee on ride-hailing trips in response to concerns that taxis were being undercut. Two years later, that fee went up to 50 cents, with an additional two-cent fee paid by the ride-hailing companies themselves. And now, the new 15-cent fee for the transit system brings the total to 65 cents for passengers.\n\nThe city also assessed a separate $5 fee on passengers who were picked up or dropped off by ride-hailing cars at the major airports, the convention center and the Navy Pier, a popular tourist destination.\n\nThe ride-hailing fees produced nearly $39 million for the city\u2019s general fund in 2016, up from about $100,000 in 2014, according to city estimates. Last year\u2019s revenue, which is still being collected, is expected to reach $72 million.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fairly new industry and once they actually got settled in the city we saw a lot of growth,\u201d the Chicago budget director, Samantha Fields, said.\n\nMayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, who has made modernizing the L a priority, said the new 15-cent fee was the first of its kind to raise money solely for public transit from those who might not even use it because they could afford the ride-hailing cars. \u201cI think it\u2019s a progressive transportation tax,\u201d Mr. Emanuel said. \u201cIt will make public transportation competitive with the rideshare industry.\u201d\n\nIn effect, Mr. Emanuel said, it will serve as a \u201cbackdoor approach\u201d to fighting congestion created by the ride-hailing cars by helping shift more people \u2014 by their own choice \u2014 to the transit system. \u201cThere\u2019s a congestion fee and I would just say the rideshare fee is kind of parallel parking into the same position,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe 15-cent fee is projected to bring in $16 million this year, which will be turned over to the Chicago Transit Authority. The money will be used to secure additional funding through bond sales to pay for a total of $179 million in capital improvements, according to city officials.\n\nKyle Whitehead, the government relations director for Active Transportation Alliance, a Chicago advocacy group for biking, walking and transit, said that the transit system contributes to the health of the city by getting more people out of cars, increasing exercise levels and reducing pollution \u2014 and it is now in dire need of money.\n\n\u201cThe public transit system benefits everyone who lives and works in the city, he said, \u201cregardless of whether they\u2019re using it.\u201d", "keywords": ["transit", "ridehailing", "public", "cities", "transportation", "tax", "cars", "uber", "city", "pay", "fee", "states", "calling", "companies"], "polarity": 0.15010715260715263, "subjectivity": 0.37249288249288265},

In addition to Mr. Romney, Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, after heavy lobbying by Mr. McConnell and Mr. Trump, reversed himself and said on Friday that he would challenge Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat seeking re-election in a state that the president won by 36 points.\n\nPhoto\n\nAdvisers to Gov.

Phil Bredesen.\n\nMr. McConnell, who is close to Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, an ally of Mr. Corker, was guarded in his comments about the election, but he chuckled when pressed on the incumbent\u2019s apparent change of heart.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt does underscore that people want to be in the Senate,\u201d he said, trying to make the best of what could become a messy primary contest. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a different environment from late summer, early fall,\u201d when the Republicans were stung by their failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nEqually delicate is the fate of Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi, who at 80 has had a series of health problems and whose seat is being eyed by a hard-line state senator, Chris McDaniel, who nearly beat him in a bitter 2014 primary race.\n\nMr. McConnell called it \u201cpremature\u201d to assess the prospect of a special election this year to replace Mr. Cochran, but did acknowledge that \u201cthere could be\u201d one. \u201cIt\u2019s up to Senator Cochran to make that decision,\u201d he said.\n\nPrivately, though, Republicans are already scrambling to protect Mr. Cochran\u2019s seat.

The company\u2019s business depends on people being highly engaged with what is posted on its sites, which in turn helps make it a marquee destination for advertisers.\n\nWhen suggestions first arose after the 2016 election that Facebook may have influenced the outcome, Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, dismissed the concerns. But by last September, Facebook had disclosed that the Internet Research Agency had bought divisive ads on hot-button issues through the company. It later said 150 million Americans had seen the Russian propaganda on the social network and Instagram.\n\nThe resulting firestorm has damaged Facebook\u2019s reputation. Company officials, along with executives from Google and YouTube, were grilled by lawmakers last fall. Facebook has since hired thousands of people to help monitor content and has worked with Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel leading the investigation into Russian election interference. It has also changed its advertising policy so that any ad that mentions a candidate\u2019s name goes through a more stringent vetting process. Mr. Zuckerberg has vowed to not let Facebook be abused by bad actors.\n\nYet Facebook\u2019s multiple mentions in Friday\u2019s indictment renew questions of why the world\u2019s biggest social media company didn\u2019t catch the Russian activity earlier or do more to stop it. How effective the company\u2019s new efforts to reduce foreign manipulation have been is also unclear.\n\nRob Goldman, Facebook\u2019s vice president of advertising, waded into the discussion on Friday with a series of tweets that argued that Russia\u2019s goal was to sow chaos among the electorate rather than to force a certain outcome in the election.

Over the next two years, the indictment said, the Russians stole the identities of real Americans to create fake personas and fake accounts on social media. The group then used those to populate and promote Facebook pages like United Muslims of America, Blacktivist and Secured Borders.\n\nPhoto\n\nBy 2016, the indictment said, the size of some of these Russian-controlled Facebook groups had ballooned to hundreds of thousands of followers.\n\nThe Russians then used these groups to push various messages, including telling Americans not to vote in the 2016 election for either Mr. Trump or his opponent, Hillary Clinton. In October 2016, according to the indictment, one Russian-controlled Instagram account called Woke Blacks posted a message saying: \u201cHatred for Trump is misleading the people and forcing Blacks to vote Killary. We cannot resort to the lesser of two devils. Then we\u2019d surely be better off without voting AT ALL.\u201d\n\nAround 2015, according to the indictment, the Russians also started purchasing ads on Facebook and other social media sites like Twitter, targeting specific communities within the United States. The group used stolen PayPal accounts to pay for the ads and to promote posts, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on the outreach.\n\nIn one ad, published to promote a Facebook event called \u201cDown with Hillary,\u201d an image of Mrs. Clinton was shown with a black \u201cX\u201d painted across her face.

The Americans argued they were just matching Russian capabilities and charged that Moscow was in continued violation of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces agreement, limiting tactical weapons.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet the cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and others, and the use of Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms to spread propaganda, dominated the discussion and reflected how quickly the use of these techniques has become the new battleground in a very different kind of post-Cold War conflict.\n\nThe White House cybercoordinator, Rob Joyce, was particularly direct in his accusations that Russia was behind the broad attack on Ukraine last June, called \u201cNotPetya.\u201d He described the attack as \u201cindiscriminate\u201d and noted that it paralyzed operations far beyond Ukraine, the intended target, and included the Maersk shipping system. He said the United States would retaliate, but did not say how, adding \u201cwe will not telegraph these punches.\u201d\n\nMr. Joyce is no newcomer to offensive cyberoperations; previously he ran the Tailored Access Operations unit of the National Security Agency, overseeing American cyberaction against other counties. \u201cWe are going to conduct cyberoperations,\u201d he said. But \u201cwe need to do it in a responsible, balanced way.\u201d\n\nGeneral McMaster, in his comments, argued that Russia had bridged the partisan divides in the United States, citing a 98 to 2 vote in the Senate to impose Russian sanctions. He did not mention that the administration has yet to impose those sanctions, saying the threat of them alone has begun to change Russian behavior.\n\n\u201cThat sanctions bill has not yet been used as a tool against the Russians,\u201d Christopher Painter, a former coordinator for cyberissues at the State Department, who also attended the conference. \u201cThe question now is whether they will actually use it to create consequences.

Cities like Chicago and Baltimore, with rigorous gun laws, also have two of the highest murder rates in the country. The black market for illegal guns has thrived in those cities, with gang members and criminals turning to the streets to get firearms.\n\nAnd the drop in fatal shootings in Connecticut has occurred in the context of a broad, long-term decline in violent crime across the country. Citing F.B.I. statistics, the Pew Research Center reports that violent crime fell 48 percent from 1993 to 2016.\n\nGun-rights groups say the problem is not the guns, but the individuals using them. They argue that laws alone are no panacea, and that social issues like mental illness and unemployment must be addressed to help curb gun violence. Some gun advocates have also called for more training and security for those who legally and responsibly maintain guns.\n\nStill, with little appetite in Congress to take on gun control, the debate is playing out at the state level, with Connecticut seen as a model for gun-control advocates.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cConnecticut\u2019s laws are among the nation\u2019s toughest and homicides are down,\u201d Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said. \u201cObviously the link is a circumstantial one; cause and effect can\u2019t be proven conclusively. But the numbers are all in the right direction. States like Connecticut can help shame Congress into adopting common-sense measures that keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people.\u201d\n\nState officials say Connecticut has experienced the fastest drop in violent crime of any state over the last four years. Gun-control advocates say the suspect in Florida, Nikolas Cruz, could not have bought the AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle believed used in the attack, or the high-capacity magazines, in Connecticut.\n\n\u201cWe really need to do a better job at making sure we have strong gun laws in every state in the country, because we are losing our most valuable resource, which is our children,\u201d said Jeremy I. Stein, the executive director of CT Against Gun Violence, a nonprofit advocacy group.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven in Connecticut, where parents of the children killed at Sandy Hook met with lawmakers as they debated the legislation, the measures fell short of what gun-control advocates wanted. For example, the laws did not force residents to relinquish existing assault weapons and high-capacity magazines or limit the number of firearms people could own.\n\nAt a hearing a month after the Newtown shooting, some speakers talked of the need to hold people accountable. \u201cThe problem is not gun laws. The problem is a lack of civility,\u201d said Mark Mattioli, whose son James, 6, was killed at Sandy Hook Elementary.\n\nThe Giffords Center, which keeps a state-by-state report card, gave Connecticut an A-minus for its gun laws \u2014 the same grade given to New York, which moved even more swiftly after Sandy Hook to pass stricter laws. The center ranked Connecticut 46th and New York 48th for their gun death rates, among the five lowest in the United States.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIn New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed a law a month after the massacre at Sandy Hook that is, in some respects, stricter than the one in Connecticut. The New York law not only bans the sale of assault weapons and imposes universal background checks, it also prohibits both the sale \u2014 and possession \u2014 of magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds. And it requires mental health professionals to alert the authorities about at-risk patients who should not be allowed to buy a firearm. As of Feb. 8, 77,447 people deemed to be dangerously mentally ill had been added to the database.\n\nAvery W. Gardiner, a president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said that generally, blue states are, not surprisingly, more likely to regulate guns and require background checks and licensing. Conservative red states either lack gun-safety laws or fail to enforce the ones they have. Her group\u2019s strategy includes filing lawsuits to enforce existing safety laws and countering the gun lobby, which uses its muscle in statehouses as well as Congress.\n\nThe lobbying has been hard on both sides. According to the nonpartisan National Institute on Money in State Politics, in the past three election cycles the National Rifle Association, the nation\u2019s leading gun lobby, spent a total of $10.6 million to support candidates for state office in 25 states. Between 2009 and 2016, at least two-thirds of that spending went to state contests in which the group\u2019s chosen candidate won.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cFlorida has gone the wrong way since Sandy Hook for sensible laws,\u201d Ms. Gardiner said, citing a Florida law that would have restricted doctors from even asking patients about gun safety. The Brady Center sued Florida on the grounds that the law violated the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of free speech, and a year ago a panel of federal judges ruled in the center\u2019s favor.\n\nIn Connecticut, the question of magazine capacity became emotionally charged as the stricter gun laws were being debated. That is because the Sandy Hook attacker, Adam Lanza, like other mass gunmen, used high-capacity magazines that allowed him to rapidly fire 30 rounds. A group of first graders at Sandy Hook ran past Mr. Lanza, escaping from the hail of bullets when he had to stop and reload.\n\nAt a news conference in April 2013, on the day lawmakers announced an agreement on gun control, Nicole Hockley, whose son, Dylan, died at Sandy Hook, said: \u201cWe ask ourselves every day \u2014 every minute \u2014 if those magazines had held 10 rounds, forcing the shooter to reload at least six more times, would our children be alive today?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nConnecticut\u2019s sweeping gun laws did, however, require residents who already owned high-capacity magazines and assault rifles to register them with the State Police. Today, the registry lists 52,648 assault weapons. A single resident registered 179 assault weapons, while another registered more than 500,000 magazines exceeding the 10-round limit. Between 2013 and 2017, 248 people were charged with illegally possessing an assault weapon because they either failed to register an existing weapon or had bought a weapon after the law went into effect.\n\nThe state also requires that individuals admitted to psychiatric hospitals relinquish their guns, at least temporarily. The State Police is notified of such patients by the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, which maintains a database, and ensures that upon discharge, the gun owner turns in the weapon or transfers it to someone eligible for a gun permit. In addition, people who were previously treated in a mental hospital cannot get a permit for up to two years afterward.\n\nThe National Shooting Sports Foundation, a lobby group in Newtown, Conn., declined to comment on the impact of Connecticut\u2019s gun laws \u201cout of respect for the families, the community and the ongoing law enforcement investigation\u201d in Parkland, Fla. The National Rifle Association did not respond to a request to comment.\n\nConnecticut is also one of a few states with another gun law with some teeth \u2014 an \u201cextreme risk protection order.\u201d Akin to a restraining order for domestic violence victims, the protection order, which predates Sandy Hook, gives the police the power to temporarily take away an individual\u2019s guns if a person makes threats, acts violently, abuses drugs or commits animal cruelty.\n\nIn the Florida massacre, the authorities believe that the gunman may have made threatening comments on social media, including one last September \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m going to be a professional school shooter\u201d \u2014 and had also posted a photo of a bloodied frog.\n\nA study that examined Connecticut\u2019s risk protection order found that, from 1999 to 2013, 99 percent of warrants led to the confiscation of at least one gun. In nearly half the cases, the gun owner wound up receiving psychiatric treatment.\n\nMike Lawlor, the criminal justice adviser to Governor Malloy, said that the law arose from two high-profile shootings in the 1990s by people with severe mental health issues. \u201cWhen there\u2019s no law that\u2019s actually been broken, but when there is real evidence that the person is a danger to others, the police need to have an option,\u201d he said. \u201cStep one is to get the guns.\u201d", "keywords": ["sandy", "hook", "control", "advocates", "magazines", "look", "law", "york", "massacre", "state", "laws", "florida", "gun", "connecticut", "wake", "guns"], "polarity": -0.025332773802161566, "subjectivity": 0.4034589701681538},

McFaul, an ambassador to Moscow under President Barack Obama, called Mr. Trump\u2019s reaction to the indictments \u201cshockingly weak\u201d and said he should instead have criticized Mr. Putin for violating American sovereignty or even announced plans to punish Moscow.\n\n\u201cInstead, he just focused on his own campaign,\u201d Mr. McFaul said. \u201cAmerica was attacked, and our commander in chief said nothing in response. He looks weak, not only in Moscow but throughout the world.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s silence has not necessarily stopped lower levels of his administration from responding to Russian actions, sometimes going further than Mr. Obama, who was also criticized for not doing enough to counter Moscow\u2019s threat. The Trump administration has decided to send weapons to Ukraine so it can defend itself against Russian intervention, and recently imposed sanctions on more human rights violators. After Russia ordered the American Embassy in Moscow to shed most of its staff, the administration responded by ordering Russia to close its consulate in San Francisco and diplomatic annexes in New York and Washington.\n\nLikewise, in just the past few days, the Trump administration formally blamed Russia for an expansive cyberattack last year called NotPetya and threatened unspecified \u201cinternational consequences.\u201d The nation\u2019s intelligence agency directors, including those appointed by Mr. Trump, unanimously warned in congressional testimony that Russia was already meddling in this year\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s own aides readily acknowledge the reality that he does not. Besides describing Russian interference as undeniable on Saturday, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, his national security adviser, speaking at the Munich Security Conference, said Mr. Mueller\u2019s charges made clear that Russia had been engaged in a \u201csophisticated form of espionage\u201d against the United States.\n\n\u201cWith the F.B.I. indictment, the evidence is now really incontrovertible and available in the public domain,\u201d he said.\n\nLate Saturday night, however, Mr. Trump, contradicted General McMaster, writing on Twitter shortly before midnight that his aide \u201cforgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia\u201d and the Democrats.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a second late-night tweet, Mr. Trump said that the F.B.I. missed warning signs of the gunman who killed 17 people at a Florida school on Wednesday because it was too focused on the Russia investigation. \u201cVery sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is not acceptable.

When his Justice Department indicted the 13 Russians and three Russian entities on Friday for trying to \u201csow discord in the U.S. political system,\u201d the president focused on the fact that no evidence was presented that he or his campaign was knowingly involved.\n\nIndeed, the indictment made no assertion that the president or anyone affiliated with him did anything wrong, understandably a relief for Mr. Trump, given a year of investigation and media reports exploring the possibility of collaboration with Russia. The \u201cinformation warfare against the United States,\u201d as one Russian organization called it, started as early as 2014, predating Mr. Trump\u2019s entry into the race.\n\nBut the indictment also determined that by 2016 the effort had evolved into a deliberate attempt to support Mr. Trump and disparage Mrs. Clinton. And the charges against the Russians are not the end of the investigation by Mr. Mueller, nor do they mean that there were no contacts or cooperation that may eventually spell legal trouble for people in the president\u2019s orbit.\n\nPrevious legal filings and news accounts have documented multiple contacts between Mr. Trump\u2019s team and Russians in 2016. Among them was a June 2016 meeting hosted by Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s son, Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, and Paul J. Manafort, his campaign chairman, on the promise that Russian visitors would provide incriminating information about Mrs. Clinton as part of the Russian government\u2019s support of the elder Mr. Trump.\n\nThe findings included in Friday\u2019s indictment bolstered the conclusions of American intelligence agencies, which for more than a year have said that Russia interfered in the election, a determination that Mr. Trump has occasionally accepted but more often dismissed as a \u201choax.\u201d Only in a written statement that aides issued in his name after his tweet on Friday was any concern expressed about the Russian attack described in the indictment, and then only to urge his critics to stop questioning him.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cWe cannot allow those seeking to sow confusion, discord and rancor to be successful,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt\u2019s time we stop the outlandish partisan attacks, wild and false allegations, and far-fetched theories, which only serve to further the agendas of bad actors, like Russia, and do nothing to protect the principles of our institutions. We must unite as Americans to protect the integrity of our democracy and our elections.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s position stood in contrast to that of fellow Republicans who responded to the indictment with calls for tougher action against Russia. To many, the president\u2019s reaction once again raised the question of why he would go easy on Moscow. He has spoken about Mr. Putin in generally flattering or friendly terms and avoided direct criticism even during moments of enormous stress in the relationship between the two countries.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor the moment, the government is left to act without the president. Jeh C. Johnson, a secretary of homeland security under Mr. Obama, said the best way to stop Russia from interfering in the future is the threat of a powerful response. \u201cWhen it comes to cyberattacks, it will always be easier to be on offense than defense,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when it comes to cyberattacks between nation-states, the most effective defense is to simply make the offensive behavior cost-prohibitive.\u201d\n\nBut the best way to do that, experts said, is for the president to lead the way. \u201cThe U.S. government cannot mobilize an effective strategy without White House leadership and prioritization,\u201d said Heather A. Conley, a State Department official under President George W. Bush who testified at a Senate hearing in the past week on defending against Russian interference.\n\nDespite the warnings by the intelligence chiefs and the threat detailed in the indictment, she said, \u201cthere continues to be no policy message or response, leaving our country unprotected and vulnerable.\u201d\n\nJohn P. Carlin, a former assistant attorney general for national security and chief of staff to Mr. Mueller when he was F.B.I. director, said the president\u2019s silence sent a message to Russia and the world.\n\n\u201cI think it does have consequences,\u201d he said. The American government can warn against further interference, but \u201cit would be better if it gets driven by the commander in chief. The goal is to drive a clear message that says the United States and our allies throughout the world that share our values are drawing a line that says \u2018stop, this is unacceptable.\u2019\u201d", "keywords": ["trumps", "leaves", "mr", "trump", "presidents", "russia", "2016", "silence", "conspicuous", "way", "leader", "indictment", "russian", "president", "struggle"], "polarity": 0.0938321802807784, "subjectivity": 0.3940916171056356},

To my knowledge, he always treated everyone with the utmost respect and professionalism in the workplace.\u201d\n\nKevin Smith, a spokesman for Senator Rob Portman, the Republican of Ohio in whose office Mr. Porter briefly worked as general counsel, said in a statement that no indication of inappropriate behavior was seen during Mr. Porter\u2019s time there.\n\nAfter working in Mr. Portman\u2019s office, Mr. Porter took the chief of staff job with Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, in 2014. According to two aides who worked with him there, Mr. Porter was arrogant and overly ambitious, even in a town that seems to have limitless capacity for both. He would occasionally lose his temper and become red in the face when he found himself on the losing end of a workplace argument, the aides said.\n\nAs he worked his way through Capitol Hill, Mr. Porter went through his second divorce in 2013. At some point during that separation, friends say Mr. Porter began to be less active within his Mormon community and began drinking, which is discouraged in the faith.\n\nTwo friends of Mr. Porter\u2019s, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation for appearing to defend him, said that Mr. Porter had at times struggled to reconcile a stringent religious background with his failed marriages. To be divorced once in the Mormon faith is unusual, they both said, and to be divorced twice is rare.\n\nUsually private about his personal life \u2014 few who knew him, including his colleagues at the White House, were even aware he had been married twice \u2014 he mentioned to at least one former colleague on Capitol Hill that he would never marry a Mormon woman again.\n\nAt the White House, Mr. Porter was seen a capable, if somewhat overeager, presence. The former White House official said that Mr. Porter had been discussed as a possibility as deputy chief of staff, but it was unclear whether his issues obtaining a security clearance prevented him from advancing.\n\nQuestions remain over who knew what, and when, about the investigation into Mr. Porter\u2019s background, including John F. Kelly, the chief of staff, and Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel. Late last year, a distraught girlfriend told Mr. McGahn that Mr. Porter had anger problems, according to people familiar with the conversation.\n\nMr. McGahn, who knew the woman, raised the issue with Mr. Porter, but did not follow up.", "keywords": ["worked", "harvard", "rob", "porters", "charisma", "mr", "ms", "ambition", "disguised", "republican", "house", "white", "mormon", "anger", "porter", "flareups"], "polarity": 0.06179723502304147, "subjectivity": 0.3278957780570683},

But conservatives who believed his presidency would be more of a sharp break with the Bush years are starting to express alarm. And their concern could indicate trouble for Mr. Trump if his more conventional approach on some policy issues alienates his base and depresses Republican turnout in the midterm elections in November.\n\n\u201cRight at the point when everyone was thinking in my world that things were just going swimmingly, there are some good and important questions being raised,\u201d said Matt Schlapp, president of the American Conservative Union, which this week will host Mr. Trump as a speaker at its annual Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nOthers have been less generous. Mark Levin, the right-wing talk show host who is also set to speak at CPAC, recently asked his audience, \u201cIs conservatism dead?\u201d and accused lawmakers of \u201cspending like drunken Marxists.\u201d\n\nEven some Trump allies who were initially slow to trust him \u2014 precisely because they worried about his fidelity to conservative principles \u2014 are voicing skepticism. \u201cI hope this makes conservatives across the country realize that right now, they aren\u2019t getting what they voted for in Washington,\u201d Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who clashed bitterly with Mr. Trump during the 2016 Republican primaries but is now one of the president\u2019s confidants, wrote in an essay for Time.com.\n\nThe deficits that Mr. Trump and the Republican-led Congress just approved, added Mr. Paul, who was an early Tea Party star, \u201dwould make President Obama cringe.\u201d\n\nMany Republicans do indeed prefer the more accommodating version of the president when it comes to most policies. And despite the extraordinary aspects of his presidency, Mr. Trump has approached governing in a way that bears strikingly similar parallels to Mr. Bush and Ronald Reagan.\n\nOne of Mr. Bush\u2019s first official acts as president in January 2001 was to reinstate the Mexico City Policy, a global gag rule implemented under Mr. Reagan that withholds American aid from health organizations worldwide that provide or even discuss abortion in family planning. Just three days into his administration, Mr. Trump did the same thing. The White House has since sought to expand the order.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s orders that government departments must safeguard religious liberties have echoes of Mr. Bush\u2019s efforts to promote \u201cfaith-based\u201d initiatives through special administrative offices in 11 federal agencies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s effort to comb law schools and courtrooms across the country for young, unfailingly conservative nominees to the federal bench resembles the campaign Mr. Reagan undertook to leave an enduring rightward imprint on the courts.\n\nMr. Trump has also shown a great degree of deference to the military he once vowed to pull back from foreign conflict. Last year, he signed off on a troop surge in Afghanistan and he permitted the Pentagon to loosen its rules of engagement that dictate how the armed forces can pursue targets in places like Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. Military officials had complained the Obama White House\u2019s rules prevented them from moving quickly and effectively enough.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

One of his most dramatic announcements to date, withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, had little practical effect because Congress never ratified it. And last week the Commerce Department said the nation\u2019s trade deficit with China, the official measure of how many goods American businesses import compared with exports, was the highest on record.\n\nOn health care Mr. Trump has even proposed ways to lower prescription drug costs, reminiscent of Mr. Bush\u2019s Medicare Part D.\n\nIn Mr. Trump\u2019s more conventional policies, Republicans see something they do not usually find in this White House: reassurance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons someone like me \u2014 who was in the \u2018Never Trump\u2019 camp and who ultimately didn\u2019t vote for Donald Trump \u2014 finds a lot in Donald Trump to like,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush\u2019s former press secretary.\n\nMany have come to accept Mr. Trump as someone who operates on two tracks, Mr. Fleischer added. \u201cThere\u2019s the policy track,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s the personal behavior track, which sets him so far apart that it risks drowning the rest out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere are many ways, however, in which Mr. Trump has actually gone much further than his Republican predecessors in pursuing conservative policy goals \u2014 especially in the environmental and regulatory realm. Mr. Bush, for instance, appointed a moderate Republican governor from a heavily Democratic state to lead his Environmental Protection Agency, Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey. Mr. Trump named the attorney general of Oklahoma, Scott Pruitt, who had sued the agency multiple times.\n\nMr. Trump pulled out of the Paris climate accord and announced his intention to move the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem \u2014 moves most Republicans say other conservative presidents would likely have found too unsettling.\n\nBut if once-skeptical Republicans can find reasons in Mr. Trump\u2019s policies to look the other way on some of his personal shortcomings, there are also many who see little to like about his similarities with Mr. Bush, who turned budget surpluses into gaping deficits and helped spark the Republican backlash that became the Tea Party movement.\n\nMany activists have been ratcheting up the pressure. In response to Mr. Trump\u2019s signing the budget agreement and his embrace of a pathway to citizenship for younger immigrants brought here illegally as children, the Tea Party Patriots, one of the president\u2019s most reliable supporters, said conservative voters were not getting what they signed up for.\n\n\u201cThere is a sense of frustration among a lot of people who supported President Trump from the very beginning of his campaign,\u201d said Jenny Beth Martin, the group\u2019s president. \u201cThey feel a bit betrayed and they don\u2019t feel like President Trump is keeping his promise.\u201d", "keywords": ["policy", "trump", "mr", "conservative", "trumps", "republicans", "republican", "approach", "party", "conventional", "edges", "bushs", "president"], "polarity": 0.10179344465058751, "subjectivity": 0.4000055216891951},

Still, support has grown even among Democrats, from 8 percent just before the bill passed in December to 19 percent this month. For Democrats, Mr. Cohen said, running on opposition to the bill has become more of a political gamble.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s less of a sure bet than it seemed in December,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a problem yet for Democrats, but the movement isn\u2019t a positive one.\u201d\n\nOther recent polls have shown similar upswings for the law, including a Monmouth University Poll in late January that found support for it had risen to 44 percent nationally, from 26 percent in December.\n\n\u201cI think we are essentially seeing Republicans \u2018come home\u2019 on the tax plan in our data,\u201d said Lori Weigel, a partner with Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican polling firm. \u201cThat is certainly in part due to consistent communications about the tax plan and the news coverage of prominent companies investing in workers.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have done little to counter the Republican messaging and concede it has had an effect, along with a series of high-profile company announcements of bonuses, raises or other benefits attributed to tax savings.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut they are ramping up efforts to rebrand the law as disproportionately helping shareholders and the wealthy, and they contend the boost from bonus announcements will fade.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only so long you can push a one-time bonus,\u201d said Nicole Gill, executive director of Tax March, a liberal group that has organized rallies and protests against the new law. \u201cThe fundamentals of the bill remain the same. The bill that passed is the bill that polled at 35 percent in December, and Democrats should keep talking about that.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Times polling suggests that Americans are overestimating the degree to which the benefits of the law\u2019s corporate tax cuts are flowing straight to workers \u2014 while underestimating the likelihood that the law will reduce their individual taxes.\n\nJust under one in five respondents expect to see either a raise or a bonus thanks to the law\u2019s business tax cuts. Early returns from public companies indicate that\u2019s an overshot. Just Capital, a nonprofit research organization, analyzed the 90 largest public companies that have announced how they will spend the combined $45 billion in savings they stand to receive from the tax bill this year. It found that those companies planned to pass 6 percent of those savings directly on to workers, with more than half of that spending in one-time bonuses.\n\n\u201cThat does not really track to how the public thinks the companies should be spending that money,\u201d said Martin Whittaker, Just Capital\u2019s chief executive.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The independent Tax Policy Center in Washington estimates that four in five Americans will actually see a tax cut from the law this year, though that number is projected to shrink sharply in 2027 if individual tax cuts expire as scheduled in the law.\n\nRepublicans are confident that support will continue to grow as more Americans see lower taxes reflected in their paychecks. Their confidence was reflected last week by Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, who cited Senator Heidi Heitkamp\u2019s vote against the tax bill when announcing he would run for her seat.\n\n\u201cThere is no question the tax bill has fundamentally improved the overall political environment for Republicans,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a former campaign manager and chief of staff for Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, who is now president of the public affairs firm Cavalry in Washington.\n\nClose to half of Americans now expect some direct benefit from the law \u2014 either a tax cut or a salary increase or bonus. Support for the bill is far stronger among that group: More than three-quarters of Americans approve of the law, compared with fewer than a third who don\u2019t expect a benefit or aren\u2019t sure.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGina Coats, a project manager for a plumbing company in Springfield, Mo., said she didn\u2019t follow the tax debate closely last fall. But in January, when she began preparing the company\u2019s payroll systems to handle the new law\u2019s provisions, she realized almost every employee would take home an extra $20 to $40 per week.\n\n\u201cEveryone seems to be a little more upbeat,\u201d Ms. Coats said. \u201cIt\u2019s causing people to let go of their money a little more easily.\u201d\n\nMs. Coats puts herself in that category. A few days ago, she called a contractor to move forward with a long-delayed plan to replace the roof on her house. That decision reflected her tax savings, she said, but also the strength of the local economy, which has meant lots of projects for her company, and stability for its employees.\n\n\u201cIf we have more work in the bag, then I feel more comfortable,\u201d Ms. Coats said.\n\nRepublicans have long promoted tax cuts as a way to encourage economic growth. Many economists are skeptical of that approach when unemployment is low and the Federal Reserve is moving to tamp down inflation.

That may not be easy, however. Ms. Doering said it was already hard to find good workers, and the stimulus provided by the tax cuts could make it even harder.\n\n\u201cIt was becoming more challenging to find good, solid employees with the right skill sets,\u201d Ms. Doering said. \u201cIt\u2019s even more challenging because some of these larger companies are grabbing up even more employees.\u201d", "keywords": ["support", "americans", "democrats", "cuts", "public", "buoying", "tax", "republicans", "law", "gains", "bonus", "bill", "plan", "overhaul", "companies"], "polarity": 0.11880139959408251, "subjectivity": 0.39754073839439696},

About 25,000 New Hampshire residents paid full freight for Obamacare plans last year, according to a legislative report, and their premiums increased by an average 52 percent this year. This group earns more than four times the poverty level \u2014 for a family of three, like the Hurds, that\u2019s about $82,000 a year.\n\nAnother 29,000 were getting subsidized coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, and many of them have seen their out-of-pocket costs drop this year. That is because when Mr. Trump forced premiums higher by cutting off a type of payment to insurers last fall that the law had guaranteed them, subsidies rose, too. About 53,000 are getting free Medicaid coverage through the health law\u2019s optional expansion of the program.\n\nMs. Hurd remembers watching a documentary about people signing up for Obamacare coverage last year and bristling when someone who got a big subsidy gushed about the low price.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018It\u2019s not expensive for you because everybody else is paying for it,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nShe also has problems with the Medicaid \u201cexpansion population,\u201d made up of working-age adults who have no disability \u2014 particularly those who aren\u2019t working as hard as she and her husband are. Cut off from the help Obamacare provided to everyone under a certain income level, as well as the contributions that employers make toward their employees\u2019 health coverage, she was caught in what she saw as an unduly penalized subset.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m totally happy to pay my fair share,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I\u2019m also paying someone else\u2019s share, and that\u2019s what makes me insane.\u201d\n\nMs. Hurd finished college at the University of Massachusetts, with her parents paying for it, and has a master\u2019s degree in communications, which she got tuition-free while working in admissions at Southern New Hampshire University. She\u2019s been working about 30 hours a week at the outlet mall and a small remodeling firm while looking for a job with good benefits in communications or marketing.\n\nHer husband, Matt, started his contracting business a few years ago and is finishing his undergraduate degree with the help of a loan. They bought a 1750s farmhouse just before they married; Ms. Hurd returned to work when their son, Harry, was eight weeks old.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThough roughly the same age, Ms. DiCola has followed a different course. She dropped out of the Manhattan School of Music in 2009 after her freshman year because she couldn\u2019t keep up with the tuition. Now, to supplement the scant income she gets from singing gigs, she drives for Uber and Lyft a few nights a week, sometimes more, in Boston. She earned about $15,000 last year, making sure she stayed under the threshold to qualify for Medicaid.\n\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s no different from what corporations do all the time, taking advantage of tax breaks and that sort of thing,\u201d Ms. DiCola, a soprano who talks animatedly about Verdi and Puccini, said of being on Medicaid. \u201cFrankly, if they\u2019re allowed to do it, why shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMedical care has been easy to access on Medicaid. She got physical therapy for an old injury, and when she needed to have an IUD surgically removed last year, she went to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Hanover, the state\u2019s most prestigious hospital. She paid for none of it. She spends most of her income on paying off her car, a used 2012 Prius with 160,000 miles on it, and her last outstanding student loan.\n\n\u201cThe coverage is actually really good,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just kind of finding my way, so the health insurance is so helpful.\u201d\n\nFor Ms. Hurd, health care has been something to avoid since she and her husband got the marketplace plan shortly after Harry\u2019s birth last year. (Before that, she had a job with benefits but quit because of her difficult pregnancy.) She went to an urgent care clinic for a throat culture last fall because unlike at her primary care practice, she could find out the cost, $150, upfront.

The story was about a report that found Medicaid recipients used health care more aggressively than marketplace customers, presumably because their coverage was free.\n\nInstead of giving its new Medicaid recipients traditional coverage through the program, New Hampshire uses Medicaid funds to buy them private plans through the Obamacare marketplace. The report, by an independent actuarial firm, found that average medical costs for the state\u2019s expansion population were 26 percent higher than for the marketplace\u2019s other customers in 2016.\n\nThe firm found this raised average claim costs \u2014 a proxy for premiums \u2014 for everyone by 14 percent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne of the conditions that Gov. Chris Sununu has attached to continuing expanded Medicaid here is that most adult recipients without a disability or small children will have to work, volunteer or get job training, at least 20 hours a week.

She worried when she had the flu in December and lost four days of income, she said, adding, \u201cI\u2019d like not to feel like I\u2019m constantly so close to the edge.\u201d\n\nMs. DiCola started driving for Uber and Lyft three years ago, after stints at a Panera and a train station cafe. She often shuttles customers around Boston until after midnight, making up to $25 an hour \u2014 enough to pay two or three times more than the $87.50 she owes on her student loan each month, plus buy gas. Her days include pitching in on cooking and other household duties, auditions, rehearsals and studying musical scores on her couch, a cat or two by her side. She hopes to get a college degree, find a more stable career and get access to employer health coverage. But for now, with a free place to live and with Medicaid, she said, \u201cI\u2019m able to throw all my money at paying off my debt.\u201d\n\nAnxiety and Peace of Mind\n\nMs. Hurd is a former Republican who volunteered for Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign in 2012 and voted for Carly Fiorina in the 2016 primary, but now describes her politics as more libertarian. She\u2019s pro-immigration, not least because she sees immigrants as having strong work ethics. She voted for Hillary Clinton in the general election, she said, because she finds President Trump deeply offensive, a \u201cguy who bullied his way into power.\u201d\n\nHer father, a Trump voter from the Boston suburbs, sends her articles that are critical of the health law, and they resonate with her.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven members of her own family take advantage of a flawed system, in her view, by getting Medicaid. \u201cThey don\u2019t work because they don\u2019t want to, and they get free health insurance.\u201d She said. \u201cWhat the heck? If my husband and I, who grew up with relatively middle-class backgrounds in wealthy states, know people that mooch off the system in our immediate families, imagine what it\u2019s like elsewhere.\u201d\n\nMs. DiCola\u2019s father, a solo-practice lawyer, is also a Trump supporter, but she is a liberal Democrat and uneasily aware of the anger and frustration that unsubsidized Obamacare customers are feeling \u2014 so much so that at first, she worried about sharing her story with The New York Times and \u201cbeing dragged through the mud on some 24-hour news channel\u201d for being on Medicaid.\n\nShe described her state\u2019s plan to impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients as \u201cpoor-shaming.\u201d Her friends show more empathy, she said. When she needed a root canal and crown last year and Medicaid would not have paid for it (dental care is one area that Medicaid does not cover comprehensively, or sometimes at all), she posted about it on Facebook and her friends jumped in to help.\n\nMs. DiCola doesn\u2019t expect to need much health care this year \u2014 just a physical and a new pair of glasses, which Medicaid will cover, she said. Still, she added, \u201cYou never know what could come up \u2014 my appendix could decide to burst tomorrow.\u201d In which case, Medicaid would cover the emergency room visit, surgery and hospital stay, a huge relief to Ms. DiCola, who became so anxious as Republicans in Congress tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act last summer that she stopped working for a few weeks.\n\nMs. Hurd has had no such peace of mind. A burst appendix would likely cost at least her individual deductible of $6,300.\n\nBy late January, Ms. Hurd had begun to believe that the only way for her family to have any access to health care was to drop their insurance and save the $928 a month to spend on care when they need it. Harry\u2019s recent illness had rattled her, and Matt wanted to see a chiropractor for back pain that was threatening his ability to work.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t afford to both treat his back issues and pay for insurance,\u201d she said one morning. She was crying, and it was time to go to work.\n\nThe following week, after months of searching, Ms. Hurd got offered a full-time job with benefits, running social-media marketing for a company that sells plant nutrition products. The Hurds plan on dropping their Obamacare policy in April, when her new coverage, with a $300 monthly premium, should kick in. The deductible \u2014 $3,000 per person, up to $6,000 for the family \u2014 will still be higher than she\u2019d like, but she didn\u2019t complain. Her indignation seemed to be softening.\n\n\u201cI understand that some people cannot afford health care and shouldn\u2019t just be left to suffer,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there has to be a better way than asking a very small amount of people to foot that bill.\u201d", "keywords": ["free", "gwen", "squeezed", "medicaid", "health", "ms", "coverage", "dilemma", "dicola", "trump", "work", "care", "hurd", "obamacare"], "polarity": 0.08346217274788706, "subjectivity": 0.4160650724936438},

His white shirt and gray slacks were an accordion of wrinkles. His hair, flecked with gray, drooped on his forehead and small dark rings had formed under his eyes.\n\nBut he hadn\u2019t lost his voice. The Democratic congressman from El Paso was speaking to a crowd of several hundred at Suga\u2019s restaurant, 830 miles from home, trying to make an improbable case: that he can defeat Texas\u2019s incumbent Republican senator, Ted Cruz.\n\nDemocrats need to pick up two seats in the midterm elections to win control of the Senate, but they also must defend incumbents in 10 states that President Trump won. Mr. Cruz is seen as safer than, say, Dean Heller, Nevada\u2019s Republican senator, or the seats in Arizona and Tennessee that are being vacated by incumbents. And with Democratic money playing defense for incumbents in Missouri, Indiana, West Virginia and elsewhere, Mr. O\u2019Rourke expects no cavalry from Washington to come help him.\n\nBut Democrats will need wins wherever they can get them \u2014 so the long-shot is going it alone.\n\nImage The Brandon Community Center in Lufkin.\n\nImage Laura Bowman announced supporters of Mr. O'Rourke raised $1,200 for his campaign.\n\nImage Mr. O'Rourke arrived for a town hall event in Wharton, Texas.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke told the crowd at Suga\u2019s that the \u201cDreamers\u201d \u2014 young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children \u2014 should be protected. No wall should be built on the border with a friendly country. College must be more affordable. Women deserve access to reproductive health services. All Muslims should not be banned, and the press is not the enemy of the people.\n\nHe appealed to their sense of virtue. \u201cThis smallness, this bigotry, this paranoia, this anxiety,\u201d he said, cadence accelerating, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to be for the big, aspirational, ambitious things.\u201d\n\nHe appealed to their sense of humor. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason that Congress has an approval rating of around nine percent. Nine percent! Communism ten percent. Gonorrhea eight percent. We\u2019re right in the middle.\u201d\n\nAnd he appealed to their anger at Washington. The \u201csystem is rigged,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI can tell you that access is purchased, that votes are bought and paid for, that outcomes are determined before you have a chance to call your member of Congress or senator.\u201d\n\nThe crowd cheered, they hooted, they left saying things like \u201che was great\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\n\nImage A donation bin was passed around the room in Lufkin.\n\nBefore Beaumont, Mr. O\u2019Rourke spoke to town halls this month in Lufkin and Woodville, deeply conservative places where Democrats are rarely seen. \u201cIt takes guts to come to this area,\u201d one woman in Woodville said. The man who introduced him in Lufkin had just one request, that he refrain from swearing, an admonition that Mr. O\u2019Rourke heeded in Lufkin but not in Beaumont.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke is favored to win his party primary next month and challenge Mr. Cruz. But his odds in November are beyond long. No Democrat has won a statewide office in Texas since 1994, the year before Amazon sold its first book.\n\nBy the calculations of Mike Baselice, a Republican pollster in Austin, demographic changes might make Texas competitive in 2032, certainly not in 2018. Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s quest, he said, is \u201csame book, different chapter\u201d of other Democratic hopefuls. \u201cThis is not a level playing field here.\u201d\n\nIt has been so bleak for Democrats in Texas that they define victory in terms of the size of their losses. A running joke in Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s speeches is that he has almost convinced his mother, Melissa, a Republican, to vote for him.\n\nIf the hill weren\u2019t steep enough, Mr. O\u2019Rourke also has refused to hire outside consultants or pollsters, and he will only accept contributions from individuals. He has no interest in using big data. When he tells this to Democratic colleagues in the House, some have simply turned and walked away from him, unable to take him seriously.\n\nBut there is power in the giant-killer narrative and signs that his anti-campaign playbook campaign is working. He raised $2.4 million in the last quarter, and gets applause when he notes that was $500,000 more than Mr. Cruz took in.\n\nHe has a restless energy that has put him in 217 of Texas 254 counties, driving tens of thousands of miles, fueled by bad coffee and Hostess cupcakes that supporters bring him.\n\nImage Mr. O'Rourke's schedule for a day of campaigning.\n\nImage Mr. O'Rourke stopped at a gas station near Brenham, Texas.\n\nImage Chris Evans, Mr. O'Rourke's communications director, recorded a Facebook live video in the parking lot of their hotel in Beaumont, Texas.\n\nIn Lufkin, he was greeted with chants of \u201cBeto, Beto, Beto.\u201d His campaign took in $1,258 in checks and cash dropped into a large jar.\n\n\u201cI think he can win. I think he can inspire Texans,\u201d said Susan McCulley, adding, \u201cwe\u2019re not just mad, we\u2019re scared.\u201d\n\nAnother supporter, Ferryn Martin, said, \u201cIn 2010, the Tea Party was mad. This year, we are mad.\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke tries to tap into that emotion. He livestreams almost every aspect of his campaign \u2014 the coffees, the town halls, \u201cbowling with Beto,\u201d stops at Whataburger, the drives between stops, which often include calls to voters and activists and from his wife, Amy. Driving with his left forearm and right elbow on the steering wheel, he asked her about the science fair projects of their three children.\n\nHis theory of the case is that he can make the sale in rural Texas in part simply by showing up. If he can cut down Mr. Cruz\u2019s margins there and generate energy in urban precincts and suburbs, he can become the first Democrat since Lloyd Bentsen in 1988 to win a Texas Senate seat.\n\nDemocrats in Texas have long been saying that the demographic changes sweeping the state, fueled by a surge in the Latino population, would eventually make the state two-party competitive, but even some of the more optimistic forecasts don\u2019t have that happening until 2024. Still, there are other factors at work that add to their hopes. The number of college-educated residents in the state increased by 20 percent from 2006 to 2016, according to Lloyd Potter, the Texas state demographer. Rural areas are losing population while urban and suburban areas are gaining.\n\n\u201cIf one was able to figure out how to turn out the Latino vote and the African-American vote, that could change things pretty dramatically,\u201d Mr. Potter said. \u201cThe issue is how far-off in the horizon it is.\u201d\n\nImage Velenta Mathews-Hunter, a retired school teacher, shook hands with Mr. O'Rourke in Orange, Texas.\n\nImage A cardboard cut-out of John wayne in Robert\u2019s Restaurant and Meat Market in Orange.\n\nImage\n\nBut President Trump, who carried by stated by nine percentage points, is complicating conventional analysis. \u201cAll things being equal, if there wasn\u2019t a Trump, it would be in the mid 2020s until the state would get competitive,\u201d said Russ Tidwell, a Democratic consultant who has worked in the state for decades. \u201cBut Trump makes other things possible.\u201d\n\nAnd Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign is all about a sense of the possible.\n\nHis biography does not have any of the bootstraps appeal of a Lyndon Johnson, or even Mr. Cruz, the son of immigrant parents. Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s family was well-to-do in El Paso. Born Robert Francis O\u2019Rourke, he has been known as \u201cBeto\u201d from infancy. His voice shows no hint of a Texas accent until his says his first name and sounds like he is speaking Spanish \u2014 which he does, fluently.\n\nHe was sent to Woodberry Forest boarding school in Virginia, then Columbia, where he was captain of the crew team. He played in a punk rock band, hauled expensive art and enjoyed the wanderlust that a young man from a wealthy family can afford. He went back to El Paso and started a technology company, then ran for City Council before winning his House seat in 2012, defeating an incumbent.\n\nIn the House, he has hardly left a footprint. He did not vote for Representative Nancy Pelosi to be the Democratic leader, and Mr. O\u2019Rourke, 45, thinks his party in Congress needs fresh leaders, which is one reason he supports term limits.\n\nImage Cynthia Cano, Mr. O'Rourke's campaign logistics and events director, walk to an event in Beaumont.\n\nMr. Cruz, who did not respond to a request to discuss the race, has never been as popular as Republicans like former governors George W. Bush or Rick Perry, but he has been tactically adroit and plays well to more conservative voters. He has an uneasy alliance with Mr. Trump that started with the president calling him \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d during the primaries and has evolved into invitations to the White House.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s is an emotive approach, Mr. Cruz\u2019s one of cold-eyed precision.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he is a flash in the pan,\u201d William Martin, a scholar at the Baker Institute at Rice University said of Mr. O\u2019Rourke. \u201cHe\u2019s young and fresh, and he\u2019s just intrinsically so much more attractive than Ted Cruz for voters who don\u2019t already have their minds made up.\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke knows Mr. Cruz is a skilled debater, a proven fund-raiser and a candidate who showed in his presidential campaign that he could leverage analytics into millions of votes. And the congressman has vulnerabilities. Mr. O\u2019Rourke has been arrested twice, once for a college prank, a second time, in 1998, for what he called the \u201cunforgivably\u201d bad decision to drive after \u201chaving too much to drink.\u201d Both charges were dismissed.\n\nHis mother receives fund-raising solicitations from Mr. Cruz, who calls her son a \u201cNancy Pelosi liberal,\u201d no doubt a preview of things to come.\n\nBut Mr. O\u2019Rourke also will use Mr. Cruz\u2019s well-observed ambition against him, and said that the incumbent\u2019s real goal is another White House run. He cites a letter that Mr. Cruz sent to Gov. Kim Reynolds, Republican of Iowa, talking about visiting all of Iowa\u2019s 99 counties.\n\n\u201cI know he hasn\u2019t been to all 254 of Texas\u2019 counties,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said.\n\nImage Mr. O'Rourke at Suga's restaurant in Beaumont.\n\nImage Mr. O'Rourke's campaign buttons are designed in the likeness of Robert F. Kennedy, his political hero.\n\nImage Mr. O\u2019Rourke talked to his wife, Amy, in his hotel room in Bay City, Tex.\n\nTexas is so vast that it is nearly impossible to travel the entire state the way that Mr. O\u2019Rourke has chosen to, largely by car, over state highways and rural roads, but he seems undeterred and drives most of the miles himself, with aides in passenger seats.\n\nOver lunch at the Lufkin BBQ, Mr. O\u2019Rourke said his campaign strategy was in part drawn from the 1968 presidential campaign of his political hero, Robert F. Kennedy, long on hope and aspiration.\n\nMr. Kennedy was not driven by \u201cpolls or consultants, but he really seemed to be grounded in the things that he found important,\u201d he said, adding that he often seemed to be going directly against the advice of what was going to be popular.\n\nThose seemed to be the words of a long-shot, a candidate with nothing to lose.\n\nImage Mr. O'Rourke at an event in Woodville, Texas.\n\nSign Up for the Morning Briefing Get what you need to know to start your day in the United States, Canada and the Americas, delivered to your inbox.

Justice Kennedy was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, a Republican. President Trump may be an unconventional Republican, but he is a Republican.\n\nJustices also try to retire early in a president\u2019s term, generally in the first two years, according to a 2010 study by Ross M. Stolzenberg, a demographer at the University of Chicago, and James T. Lindgren, a law professor at Northwestern. The study considered justices who served between 1789 and 2006.\n\n\u201cIf the incumbent president is of the same party as the president who nominated the justice to the court, and if the incumbent president is in the first two years of a four-year presidential term,\u201d the study found, \u201cthen the justice has odds of resignation that are about 2.6 times higher than when these two conditions are not met.\u201d\n\nJustices also take account of who controls the Senate and its internal rules.\n\n\u201cIf I resign any time this year,\u201d Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in the fall of 2014, less than two years into President Obama\u2019s second term, \u201che could not successfully appoint anyone I would like to see in the court.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo anybody who thinks that if I step down, Obama could appoint someone like me, they\u2019re misguided,\u201d she said.\n\nArtemus Ward, the author of \u201cDeciding to Leave: The Politics of Retirement From the United States Supreme Court,\u201d said Justice Kennedy found himself at a crucial crossroads. If he wants to resign under a Republican president in the first half of a presidential term, he must act.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now or never,\u201d said Mr. Ward, a political scientist at Northern Illinois University. \u201cIt\u2019s either this year or you wait until the next election.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nParty loyalty is likely to overcome more subtle concerns about judicial legacy, Mr. Ward said. Justice Kennedy holds the crucial vote in many closely divided cases, and he has been drifting to the left. He has cast conservative votes in cases on campaign finance and gun rights but has lately voted with the court\u2019s liberal wing on gay rights, abortion and affirmative action.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nBut Mr. Ward said Justice Kennedy is likely to emulate Justice Byron R. White, who drifted to the right after his appointment by President John F. Kennedy, a Democrat. Even so, Justice White said, it was fitting to retire under a Democratic president because he had been appointed by one. He stepped down not long after President Bill Clinton was elected and was replaced by Justice Ginsburg, whose voting record has been considerably more liberal.\n\nA new study on departures from the Supreme Court attempted to refine the conventional factors by considering political science data on justices\u2019 voting patterns, involuntary departures and missed opportunities. It concluded that justices have not been particularly successful at ensuring that they would be replaced by like-minded successors.\n\nJustice Kennedy is in a ticklish spot, said the study\u2019s author, Christine Kexel Chabot, who teaches at Loyola University Chicago School of Law. He is, she wrote, a moderate conservative, and there is no reason to think a president of either party would replace him with someone similar.\n\nIn all likelihood, she wrote, Mr. Trump would appoint a committed conservative like his first nominee, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch. In the few divided cases in which Justices Kennedy and Gorsuch participated in the court\u2019s last term, they agreed just 38 percent of the time. By contrast, Justice Gorsuch agreed with Justice Clarence Thomas, the court\u2019s most conservative member, 100 percent of the time.\n\nMs. Chabot also explored justices\u2019 decisions to forgo opportunities to retire under like-minded presidents.\n\nOf the 16 justices since 1954 who reached the age 65 and had served on the court for at least 18 years, Ms. Chabot found, nine passed up politically opportune retirements, risking having to leave the court for health reasons in less attractive circumstances.\n\nTwo of them \u2014 Justices White and John Paul Stevens \u2014 retired later on. Justice Elena Kagan replaced Justice Stevens, and her voting record resembles his.\n\nAnother two, Justices Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, could have retired under President Obama but continue to serve.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStaying on is understandable, Ms. Chabot wrote. \u201cRetirement from the court is very costly for a justice,\u201d she wrote, \u201cas he or she must permanently give up what is often an immensely personally rewarding position as well as the most powerful judicial office in the United States.\u201d\n\nTry as they might, Mr. Ward said, justices have had only mixed success in deciding when to step down.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t completely time their retirements perfectly because they\u2019re just like us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know when they\u2019re going to get sick, and they don\u2019t know when they\u2019re going to die, and they don\u2019t know who is going to win the next election.\u201d\n\nAs for Justice Kennedy, Ms. Chabot noted in an interview that he has hired law clerks for the term that starts in October. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he remains on the bench,\u201d she said.", "keywords": ["retire", "justices", "ward", "term", "decision", "mr", "influences", "chabot", "kennedy", "justice", "anthony", "president", "wrote", "court"], "polarity": 0.11881962481962483, "subjectivity": 0.40213419913419907},

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/us/politics/trump-kelly-porter.html", "text": "There would be much to investigate. A few senior officials in the West Wing had access to details of the allegations of physical and emotional abuse made by Mr. Porter\u2019s ex-wives. A greater number of people had a sense that something was amiss, but chose to avert their gaze instead of asking questions.\n\nThe first hours after the issue was brought to light by an article in The Daily Mail were a confused blur, with officials like Mr. Kelly at first endorsing Mr. Porter\u2019s resignation, but then agreeing to issue statements in support of him. That disarray belied the belief of some in the White House that someone \u2014 Mr. Kelly \u2014 was finally in charge after six months of drama and infighting in 2017. In reality, these officials now concede, no one truly was.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t figured out how the place operates, and apparently they don\u2019t want to learn,\u201d said John Dean, a White House counsel under President Richard M. Nixon. The Porter situation, he added, \u201cis a manifestation of what happens when you have chaos.\u201d\n\nMr. Kelly, a four-star Marine general, had been billed as uniquely qualified to bring order to Mr. Trump\u2019s world when he took his post in July. Now he faces a morale crisis in the West Wing, where aides describe a sense of betrayal by a chief of staff they no longer trust after his claims that he had not fully known about Mr. Porter\u2019s problems and had acted within minutes once he learned of them.\n\nBut above all, White House veterans say, President Trump is responsible for the haphazard nature with which his operation has functioned, in part because he knew and cared little for the rules and norms that govern the executive branch. Unprepared to fill the ranks of a new administration, Mr. Trump never tried to set a tone of discipline or ethical rigor in his West Wing.\n\n\u201cA White House reflects the president,\u201d said William M. Daley, a chief of staff under Mr. Obama. \u201cSo he moves on to the next scandal, crisis, attack, whatever, and no self-reflection. So why should anyone be surprised that that sort of becomes the M.O., even when there\u2019s a belief that there\u2019s institutional stuff one should consider.\u201d\n\nFor 13 months, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides have approached their mercurial and process-averse boss by putting their heads down and ignoring what they could not control, avoiding information that could rattle their daily balance.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut in the case of Mr. Porter, White House aides privately acknowledge, some advisers appear to have chosen to try to protect a colleague who was generally well liked and, more important, too competent to lose. Mr. Trump himself often expressed his regard for Mr. Porter by describing him as \u201cout of central casting.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the hours after the allegations against Mr. Porter became public, some senior officials in fact hesitated to force him out, in part because they argued that if one top adviser could be felled by accusations, they could all potentially be vulnerable. Mr. Porter denied privately to his colleagues, as well as publicly, that he had ever physically abused his wives.\n\nWhat distinguished this crisis from the ones that preceded it was that it was not localized to one official, such as Stephen K. Bannon, the isolated chief strategist who left in August, or Reince Priebus, the often uninformed chief of staff who departed a month before that. Mr. Porter\u2019s case had spread to so many aspects of the White House that it ensnared a number of staff members.\n\nWhile multiple officials in the West Wing were aware that he had been unable to pass his background check, none appear to have made an effort to ascertain precisely why and take action on it. Several former White House counsels have said they would have made it their business to know if an official at Mr. Porter\u2019s level was facing allegations as serious as domestic abuse, but officials in the White House have privately maintained that Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, never did.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Bauer, a White House counsel under President Barack Obama.\n\nC. Boyden Gray, who served as White House counsel under President George Bush, said the problems might have been exacerbated by the existence of the special counsel investigation into Russian election meddling and potential Trump campaign ties to it.\n\nMr. McGahn and other senior officials may be reluctant to engage with the F.B.I. or the Justice Department on security clearances or any other matter, for fear of being drawn into the inquiry, he said. \u201cYou just didn\u2019t want to call the F.B.I. or call the D.O.J. on any subject, Russia or not,\u201d Mr. Gray said of officials in the West Wing. \u201cThat may have contributed to the breakdown here.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Mr. Trump has been in open war with the F.B.I. for months, a fact that some West Wing aides believe contributed to the debacle.\n\nThe dismissal on Wednesday of George David Banks, who was the White House point person on climate change, was seen as a particularly galling move after 13 months in which nobody in the West Wing had seemed particularly concerned about enforcing a standard for past conduct.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Banks had been told that he would not be granted a full security clearance. In an interview, he said the reason was that he had smoked marijuana a handful of times between 2010 and 2013, conduct that he said he had self-reported to the F.B.I. nearly a year ago.\n\n\u201cIt was unbelievable,\u201d Mr. Banks said of the decision to deny him a clearance, which he learned about abruptly at the end of a workday, when an official from Mr. McGahn\u2019s office and a human resources aide asked for a meeting later that evening. After informing him of their decision and allowing Mr. Banks to resign, they asked him to gather his things and escorted him from the premises.\n\nInside the West Wing, officials said, Mr. Banks is seen as collateral damage in a belated effort by Mr. Kelly and other top officials to show they are cracking down on interim security clearances.\n\nYet former White House advisers from both parties have been mystified at the ineptitude of Mr. Trump\u2019s team in dealing with the fallout from Mr. Porter\u2019s situation.\n\nPart of the problem, they argue, is a culture at the White House that does not appear to prioritize getting at the truth.\n\n\u201cThe fundamentals of Crisis Management 101 were certainly not observed here, but more importantly, there does not seem to be a priority on marshaling and disclosing the facts, whatever they may be,\u201d said Jack Quinn, who served as White House counsel under Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky affair. \u201cThey need to stop the bleeding, and I think that they\u2019ve got to understand that the bleeding is not going to stop until the full truth is told.\u201d", "keywords": ["officials", "west", "wing", "mr", "porters", "learn", "counsel", "trump", "scandal", "abuse", "house", "white", "seeks", "president"], "polarity": 0.06546208192247795, "subjectivity": 0.3426424785335676},

President Trump then cited him. We fact-checked Mr. Goldman.\n\nImage President Trump cited tweets by Rob Goldman as proof that Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign was about something other than giving him an election victory. Credit Tom Brenner/The New York Times\n\nRob Goldman, vice president for ads at Facebook, posted an eight-part thread on Twitter late Friday about his company\u2019s role in Russian disinformation \u2014 and quickly caused a firestorm.\n\nIn his messages, Mr. Goldman discussed the indictment of 13 Russians and three companies accused of carrying out a scheme to subvert the 2016 election. Facebook was frequently mentioned in the indictment as the main tech tool that the Russians had used to tilt the election in favor of Donald J. Trump.\n\nMr. Goldman defended Facebook in his tweets, saying that the Russian-bought ads on the social network were not primarily aimed at swaying the vote result. His posts went viral on Saturday when President Trump cited them as proof that Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign was about something other than giving him an election victory.\n\nThe Fake News Media never fails. Hard to ignore this fact from the Vice President of Facebook Ads, Rob Goldman! https://t.co/XGC7ynZwYJ \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2018\n\nWe fact-checked Mr. Goldman\u2019s eight tweets. Here\u2019s what we found.\n\n\u201cWe shared Russian ads with Congress, Mueller and the American people to help the public understand how the Russians abused our system.\u201d Tweet #1\n\nPartly true.\n\nWhen the Russians\u2019 use of Facebook to influence the 2016 election became public last year, the company said it was sharing the Russian-bought ads with Congress and Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel leading the investigation.\n\nBut Facebook did not directly share the ads with the American people. Instead, the House Intelligence Committee released examples of the ads ahead of congressional hearings last November.\n\n\u201cI have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal.\u201d Tweet #2\n\nNot according to the indictment.\n\nThe grand jury indictment secured by Mr. Mueller asserts that the goal of Russian operatives was to influence the 2016 election, particularly by criticizing Hillary Clinton and supporting Mr. Trump and Bernie Sanders, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s chief rival for the Democratic nomination.\n\nThe Russians \u201cengaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump,\u201d the indictment said.\n\nMr. Goldman later wrote in another tweet that \u201cthe Russian campaign was certainly in favor of Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe majority of the Russian ad spend happened AFTER the election.\u201d Tweet #3\n\nTrue, but here is some context.\n\nAccording to figures published by Facebook last October, 44 percent of the Russian-bought ads were displayed before the 2016 election, while 56 percent were shown afterward. Mr. Goldman asserted that those figures were not published by the \u201cmainstream media\u201d \u2014 however, many mainstream news outlets did print those numbers, including CNN, Reuters and The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cThe main goal of the Russian propaganda and misinformation effort is to divide America by using our institutions, like free speech and social media, against us.\u201d Tweet #4\n\nNot exactly.\n\nThe indictment does show that Russian operatives used social media \u2014 particularly Facebook \u2014 to try to sow division among Americans. But to reiterate, the indictment said that the Russians\u2019 goal was to sway the 2016 election toward a particular outcome. That aim was pursued not just through ads, which Mr. Goldman focuses on, but through Facebook pages, groups and events.\n\n\u201cThe single best demonstration of Russia\u2019s true motives is the Houston anti-islamic protest. Americans were literally puppeted into the streets by trolls who organized both the sides of protest.\u201d Tweet #5\n\nThis needs context.\n\nThe protests in Houston in May 2016 were among many rallies organized by Russian operatives through Facebook. While the Houston protest was anti-Islamic, as Mr. Goldman said, he failed to note that the goal in promoting the demonstration was to link Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign with a pro-Islamic message.\n\nAccording to the indictment secured by Mr. Mueller, there were many other examples of Russian operatives using Facebook and Instagram to organize pro-Trump rallies. At one protest, the Russian operatives paid for a cage to be built, in which an actress dressed as Mrs. Clinton posed in a prison uniform.\n\n\u201cThe Russian campaign is ongoing. Just last week saw news that Russian spies attempted to sell a fake video of Trump with a hooker to the NSA.\u201d Tweet #6\n\nTrue.\n\nAmerican intelligence officials have said that Russia has continued to target the American public and that it is already meddling in the 2018 midterm elections. The New York Times also reported this month on an attempt by a shadowy Russian figure to sell stolen American cyberweapons, as well as compromising material on President Trump, to the United States.\n\n\u201cThere are easy ways to fight this. Disinformation is ineffective against a well educated citizenry. Finland, Sweden and Holland have all taught digital literacy and critical thinking about misinformation to great effect.\u201d Tweet #7\n\nNot exactly.\n\nWhile Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands have all made efforts to teach digital literacy, those countries are still grappling with how to handle misinformation. A recent survey in Finland found that 67 percent of respondents \u201cthink fake news affects Finns\u2019 perceptions on issues \u2018a lot\u2019 or to an \u2018extreme\u2019 degree.\u201d Officials in Sweden and the Netherlands have also recently warned that fake news poses a threat to their governments.\n\n\u201cWe are also taking aggressive steps to prevent this sort of meddling in the future by requiring verification of political advertisers and by making all ads on the platform visible to anyone who cares to examine them.\u201d Tweet #8\n\nTrue.\n\nAfter initially dismissing concerns that it influenced the 2016 election, Facebook has announced a series of moves to prevent its future misuse. One of those steps includes verifying political advertisers through a system that combines automated and human fact checkers. The company has also said it plans to use postcards sent by regular mail to verify the identities of American political advertisers. Whether these new measures will be effective is unclear.\n\nCorrection : Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the month when protests organized by Russian operatives were held in Houston.

{"title": "\n                    Indictment Leaves No Doubt: Russia Backed Trump. But Was It the Difference?                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/18/us/politics/trump-election-russia.html", "text": "The dispute is especially raw because of the razor-thin margin in the election and the uncertainty over what exactly tipped the balance. Mrs. Clinton, who handily won the national popular vote, lost the Electoral College vote and therefore the presidency because Mr. Trump defeated her by less than a combined 80,000 votes in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nFew Democrats believe that Mr. Trump won solely as a result of Russia\u2019s intervention. But many think the meddling exacerbated Mrs. Clinton\u2019s challenges, making her more vulnerable to what some believe was the decisive blow: the announcement by James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director at the time, just over a week before the election that he was reopening the investigation into her use of a private email server.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cRussia succeeded in weakening her enough so that the Comey letter could knock her off,\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, who was Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign communications director.\n\nBut veterans of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign shake their head at what they believe is an abiding sense of denial among Clinton loyalists over her deficiencies.\n\n\u201cThe election was still won because Donald Trump was a better candidate with a superior message taking on a horrible candidate who people thought was corrupt,\u201d said David Bossie, a senior Trump strategist who is now president of the conservative lobbying group Citizens United. He allowed that Moscow had mounted a \u201cmalicious, disruptive campaign.\u201d\n\nNo single factor was determinative in an election that brought nearly 140 million Americans to the polls. And the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies say they do not have any way to calculate whether the Russian effort swung the election.\n\n\u201cTo credit the victory to anyone else including those 13 Russians is to demean everyday Americans\u2019 power to control their own destiny,\u201d said Stephen K. Bannon, the Trump campaign chief executive, who reportedly spent 20 hours with the team led by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in the Russia investigation, last week. \u201cThe \u2018deplorables\u2019 deserve better.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet it is difficult for Republicans to contend that the multimillion-dollar Russian intervention had no impact, with 126 million Americans being exposed to Russian-sponsored posts on Facebook alone.\n\nThe interference was not limited to the actions laid out by Mr. Mueller in the indictment of the 13 Russians linked to a \u201ctroll farm\u201d known as the Internet Research Agency.\n\nAccording to the intelligence community, the Russian government supported the email hacking of the Democratic National Committee and the personal account of John D. Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, as well as the disclosure of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s paid speeches. The committee emails, leaked just before the Democratic National Convention, helped increase the rancor between supporters of Mrs. Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nAnd the Podesta emails, leaked slowly over the month of October, were doled out selectively, with a number of exchanges held back, according to two Clinton campaign officials. While there were plenty of anodyne messages in the trove, the hackers made sure to reveal the messages that maximized the appearance of D.N.C. behavior unfairly favoring Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nFurther, a major factor in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s loss of the three crucial Rust Belt states, which every Democratic nominee had carried since 1992, was a drop-off in turnout and the performance of third-party candidates.\n\nShe could not match former President Barack Obama\u2019s turnout among blacks in cities like Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee, and the Green Party nominee, Jill Stein, captured enough votes to make up the difference between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It says that they funded social media posts that were explicitly aimed at encouraging \u201cU.S. minority groups not to vote in the 2016 U.S. presidential election or to vote for a third-party U.S. presidential candidate.\u201d\n\nFor example, the Russians created an Instagram account, \u201cWoke Blacks,\u201d and posted messages urging African-Americans not to vote at all rather than support \u201cthe lesser of two devils.\u201d They also purchased an ad on Instagram to promote a post that read: \u201cChoose peace and vote for Jill Stein. Trust me, it\u2019s not a wasted vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Stein vote alone clearly diminished Clinton\u2019s vote and some of the vote that might have gone to us in Milwaukee and stayed home was probably discouraged, and this Russia stuff played a role in that discouragement,\u201d said Paul Maslin, a Democratic pollster based in Wisconsin. \u201cOut of the 10 factors that most caused Trump to win, maybe this was only the seventh, but the fact that this is even on a relatively short list ought to be alarming.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, Republicans and even some Democrats note that the Russian meddling may not have mattered at all if Mrs. Clinton had run a better campaign. She ventured twice to Ohio in the final days of the campaign \u2014 a state she would lose by eight points \u2014 but never set foot in Wisconsin during the general election, and she made a few strategic errors in Michigan.\n\nDespite pleas from Michigan officials, her national campaign did not ask Mr. Obama to visit the state until the last day of the campaign \u2014 and it was forced to dispatch him to Ann Arbor to rally college students rather than sending him to Detroit, because a police funeral was scheduled in the city.\n\nAnd when Mrs. Clinton visited Michigan in the last days of the election, she spent some of her time in the deeply conservative and religious western part of the state trying to win over Republicans who were thought to be uneasy with Mr. Trump on moral grounds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d said Representative Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who pleaded with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign to devote more attention to the state. \u201cThe Russians clearly did things that made their way into Michigan. At the same time, as Democrats, if we\u2019re not talking about issues that matter to people, then we\u2019re not connecting with our base either.\u201d\n\nStu Sandler, a Michigan Republican strategist, was blunter: \u201cClinton didn\u2019t do enough in inner-city Detroit, and that was noticed by a lot of Democrats here.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton did spend considerable time in Pennsylvania, but she suffered there from what plagued her in the other parts of the industrial Midwest: Too many black voters stayed home, a slice of white liberals voted third-party, and many of the working-class whites who had backed Mr. Obama swung to Mr. Trump.\n\nHer environmental and gun-control policies turned off some of the state\u2019s ancestral Democrats, and the views she and her husband held in the 1990s on criminal justice depressed black turnout.\n\n\u201cShe was very unpopular here, so she didn\u2019t motivate the Democrats,\u201d said Rob Gleason, who was the state Republican chairman in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo Democrats, though, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s shortcomings were precisely what Russia preyed on to undercut her campaign.\n\n\u201cWe will never be able to know for certain if the massive Russian operation was the difference between victory and defeat,\u201d said Representative Brendan F. Boyle of Pennsylvania. \u201cBut there is one thing we absolutely can say with certainty: It was a factor. The Russians wouldn\u2019t have devoted hundreds of people and tens of millions of dollars on this operation if it wasn\u2019t having an effect.\u201d\n\nEven as Mr. Trump polarizes the country, both his admirers and detractors found themselves in agreement with one of his many Twitter observations on Sunday: that the Russians intended to sow chaos, and \u201chave succeeded beyond their wildest dreams.\u201d", "keywords": ["michigan", "campaign", "leaves", "trump", "mr", "vote", "russia", "clinton", "mrs", "doubt", "backed", "clintons", "election", "indictment", "russians", "difference"], "polarity": 0.06753924267222139, "subjectivity": 0.4347604818349497},

Mr. Cohen was not representing anyone in the confidential agreement, but he was apprised of it by Ms. McDougal\u2019s lawyer, and earlier had been made aware of her attempt to tell her story by the media company, according to interviews and an email reviewed by The New York Times.\n\nPhoto\n\nTwo months later, Mr. Cohen played a direct role in a similar deal involving an adult film star, Stephanie Clifford, who used the stage name Stormy Daniels, and who once said she had had an affair with Mr. Trump. Last week, Mr. Cohen said he used his own money for the $130,000 payment to her, which has prompted a complaint alleging that Mr. Cohen violated campaign finance regulations. Legal experts also have noted that the payment on behalf of his client may have violated New York\u2019s ethics rules.\n\nMr. Cohen, who is still described as Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer although he is no longer on the Trump Organization payroll, has denied any wrongdoing and insists the arrangement was legal. In an interview, he disputed details of some of his other activities that were described to The Times. But he has never shied away from his role as Mr. Trump\u2019s loyal defender. \u201cIt is not like I just work for Mr. Trump,\u201d Mr. Cohen said in an interview in 2016. \u201cI am his friend, and I would do just about anything for him and also his family.\u201d\n\nAn examination of the efforts to shield Mr. Trump from aspects of his own past shows how Mr. Cohen maneuvered in the pay-to-play gossip world \u2014 populated by porn stars and centerfold models, tabloid editors and lawyers with B- and C-list entertainment clients \u2014 that came to unusual prominence in an American presidential election.\n\nMr. Cohen exploited mutual-self interest. By heading off trouble involving Mr. Trump\u2019s history with women, he accrued loyalty points, the ultimate currency with Mr. Trump. He dealt with lawyers who could win fat cuts of any settlements women might reach with American Media or with Mr. Trump.\n\nAt least two women got money and, in Ms. McDougal\u2019s case, a promise of favorable attention in American Media publications, which include The National Enquirer, Star, Us Weekly and Radar. Mr. Trump, of course, benefited the most: avoiding more scrutiny as he struggled to dismiss multiple allegations of groping and unwanted advances that arose during the campaign.\n\nOne American Media executive, in a 2016 interview, said that the priority was that nothing embarrassing come out. But in the gossip economy, secrets last only as long as the incentives to keep them do.\n\nPhoto\n\nRisqu\u00e9 Photos\n\nIt was July 2015 when Mr. Cohen received a phone call from Jeremy Frommer, a hedge-fund manager turned digital entrepreneur, who had obtained photos of Mr. Trump appearing to autograph the breasts of a topless woman from the estate of Bob Guccione, the founder of Penthouse magazine. Mr. Cohen was not pleased.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe was in a rage,\u201d Mr. Frommer said in an interview. \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018If you show those photos, I\u2019m gonna take you down.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt was the rough talk of a Long Island native who started his career juggling work as a personal injury lawyer and taxi fleet manager and met Mr. Trump after acquiring units in Trump buildings.\n\nAfter Mr. Cohen joined the Trump Organization in 2006, the role that Mr. Trump wanted him to play was clear: a combination of aggressive spokesman and lieutenant who would take on the real estate mogul\u2019s antagonists. It was a job Roy Cohn, a New York lawyer best known for advising Senator Joseph McCarthy, had done decades earlier for Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen\u2019s work for his boss was often a mystery even to others in his office, but his devotion was clear.\n\nIn talking with Mr. Cohen, Mr. Frommer mentioned Mr. Pecker. Years earlier, Mr. Frommer had sold American Media the exclusive rights to a suggestive photograph of Arnold Schwarzenegger \u2014 which it did not publish \u2014 and he knew the company\u2019s chief executive.\n\nMr. Frommer recalled Mr. Cohen\u2019s saying, \u201cYeah, I know Pecker.\u201d Mr. Frommer added, \u201cThat\u2019s where the conversation calmed down.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Pecker and Mr. Trump, a staple of the American gossip media since the 1980s, have a friendship that goes back decades. The relationship benefited Mr. Trump throughout the campaign as The Enquirer lionized him and hammered rivals like Ted Cruz, Ben Carson and, finally, Hillary Clinton.\n\nMr. Cohen formed his own bond with Mr. Pecker, keeping in touch with him and Dylan Howard, a top executive, throughout the campaign.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmerican Media acknowledged those ties, saying in a statement, \u201cMichael Cohen and President Trump have been personal friends of Mr. Pecker\u2019s for decades.\u201d But, it said, neither of them \u201cnor any other individual has attempted to, or ever, influenced (or will ever influence) coverage at A.M.I.\u2019s publications. Period.\u201d\n\nAfter the initial blowup, Mr. Frommer said, he and Mr. Cohen quickly agreed that Mr. Frommer would take the Trump photos to Mr. Pecker. The men soon began discussing potential business deals, including an interview with Mr. Trump as part of a joint project between American Media and Mr. Frommer\u2019s company, Jerrick Media, according to text messages and emails reviewed by The Times.\n\n\u201cSpoke to Cohen we are set. Well done!\u201d Mr. Pecker told Mr. Frommer in a July 2015 text exchange.\n\nTwo months later, when Mr. Frommer expressed doubt that the Trump interview would take place, Mr. Cohen responded in an Oct. 5 email: \u201cNo no \u2026 relax. I am on it and will make it happen.\u201d\n\nGot a confidential news tip? Do you have the next big story? Want to share it with The New York Times? We offer several ways to get in touch with and provide materials to our journalists.\n\nMr. Frommer said he had assured Mr. Cohen at the time that he wouldn\u2019t make the photos public \u2014 \u201cI said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to publish them\u2019\u201d \u2014 but that the decision had nothing to do with the business talks.\n\nIn the end, American Media concluded that the photos were of little value. The interview and the deals never materialized for Mr. Frommer, who went on to publish one of the Trump photos on his own website.\n\nAmerican Media said in a statement that it had no interest in suppressing the photographs. But in early 2016, an American Media executive, speaking only on condition of anonymity in discussing internal company thinking, said that when the negotiations between A.M.I. and Mr. Frommer began, they were intended to suppress the photos, part of broader efforts by American Media to \u201ccatch and kill\u201d information that would damage Mr. Trump.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It was also where people looking to sell potentially damaging information about Mr. Trump were likely to turn.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the summer of 2016, American Media came to Mr. Cohen with a story involving Ms. McDougal, the former Playboy Playmate. She claimed to have had a consensual affair with Mr. Trump in the mid-2000s, early in his marriage to Melania Trump. Mr. Trump denies an affair.\n\nMs. McDougal had retained Keith Davidson, a Hollywood lawyer, who reached out to contacts at American Media. After negotiating on and off for a couple of months, A.M.I. agreed to give Ms. McDougal $150,000 for the exclusive rights to her story, along with promises of publicity and marketing opportunities through its fitness magazines. The contract did not identify Mr. Trump, but required her to keep quiet about any relationship with a married man.\n\nA.M.I. had shared her allegations with Mr. Cohen, though it said it did so only as it worked to corroborate her claims, which it said it ultimately could not do. But that was not the only heads-up Mr. Cohen received.\n\nSoon after Ms. McDougal signed the confidential agreement on Aug. 5, 2016, Mr. Davidson emailed Mr. Cohen, \u201cMichael, please give me a call at your convenience.\u201d Mr. Davidson followed up by explaining to Mr. Cohen over the phone that the McDougal transaction had been completed, according to a person familiar with the conversation. Mr. Cohen said, \u201cI don\u2019t recall those communications.\u201d\n\nMr. Davidson acknowledged the public\u2019s interest in Ms. Clifford\u2019s and Ms. McDougal\u2019s stories, but said that he was \u201cnot at liberty to discuss private client information.\u201d\n\nIn the months after Ms. McDougal\u2019s agreement with A.M.I., Mr. Trump\u2019s relationships with women drew more scrutiny on the campaign trail. The release of an audio recording that captured the candidate bragging about grabbing women\u2019s genitals inspired numerous women to step forward with allegations that he had groped or kissed them against their will.\n\nPhoto\n\nAccording to people in contact with her at the time, Ms. McDougal expressed frustration with what she viewed as foot-dragging by A.M.I. in fulfilling commitments made in her contract and with Mr. Davidson\u2019s lackluster response to her. She reached out to a prominent First Amendment lawyer, Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., who had made a public pledge in October 2016 to defend anyone threatened with legal action by Mr. Trump for making allegations against him. Mr. Boutrous briefly represented Ms. McDougal, focusing primarily on her restrictive contract with A.M.I., which in late November 2016 agreed she could respond to \u201clegitimate\u201d press inquiries about the alleged affair.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. McDougal\u2019s story eventually became public, in a Wall Street Journal article published days before the election. The New Yorker published new details, including an interview with her, last week.\n\nQuelling a Storm\n\nOver the years Mr. Cohen had come to know Ms. McDougal\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Davidson, well enough that when New York magazine profiled Mr. Davidson last week, Mr. Cohen offered an enthusiastic endorsement: \u201cHe has always been professional, ethical and a true gentleman.\u201d (The California State Bar suspended Mr. Davidson\u2019s law license for 90 days in 2010, for four counts of misconduct.)\n\nMr. Davidson\u2019s client list had included the professional athletes Jalen Rose and Manny Pacquiao, as well as gossip-page regulars who placed him in the middle of the sex-tape cases of the \u201cAustin Powers\u201d actor Verne Troyer, the wrestler Hulk Hogan and the onetime Playboy model and MTV host Tila Tequila. He was a natural choice for Ms. Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, when she sought to sell her own Trump story.\n\nShe was alleging that she had had a consensual sexual relationship with Mr. Trump after they met at a celebrity golf tournament about 10 years earlier (Mr. Trump denies her claims).\n\nJust two months after Ms. McDougal\u2019s story was effectively muted by her contract with American Media, Mr. Davidson set about brokering the silence of the adult film actress. This time, the negotiator on the other end of the transaction was Mr. Cohen.\n\nThe actress agreed to a $130,000 settlement in mid-October 2016 in exchange for keeping quiet, according to contracts seen by The Times and people familiar with the matter. To make the payment, Mr. Cohen created a Delaware limited liability company called Essential Consultants, news of which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal last month, and he claimed in a statement first released to The Times last week that the money came from his own pocket.\n\nMs. Clifford has suggested in recent days that she believes Mr. Cohen has breached that agreement and that she is preparing to speak out. In 2011, she had told her story about Mr. Trump to two gossip publications. One of them, In Touch magazine, did not publish the story after Mr. Cohen warned that he would pursue aggressive legal action, The Associated Press reported last month.\n\nThe other outlet, The Dirty, took down a brief story after Mr. Davidson threatened legal action just a day after his client had provided information to the website, according to Nik Richie, The Dirty\u2019s founder, and a letter seen by The Times.\n\nAfter the deal between Ms. McDougal and A.M.I. was completed, Mr. Davidson regularly exchanged emails, text messages and calls with Mr. Cohen, according to people familiar with the contacts, including last week, when Mr. Davidson publicly bolstered Mr. Cohen\u2019s statement that he had paid Ms. Clifford himself.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Cohen went on to steer a new client to Mr. Davidson, Chuck LaBella, a former NBC executive who worked closely with Mr. Trump on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d and the \u201cMiss USA\u201d pageant. Mr. LaBella had become the object of an intense Twitter campaign \u2014 led by the comedian and ardent Trump critic Tom Arnold \u2014 calling upon him to share anything he might know about misbehavior by Mr. Trump. He became a client of Mr. Davidson last fall, according to people familiar with the arrangement.", "keywords": ["intimidation", "cohen", "trumps", "payouts", "mr", "trump", "media", "ms", "fixer", "frommer", "photos", "davidson", "tools", "american", "tabloids", "mcdougal"], "polarity": 0.09627945444706808, "subjectivity": 0.3578314204734663},
{"title": "\n                    1.5 Million Retirees Await Congressional Fix for a Pension Time Bomb                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/18/business/multiemployer-pension-crisis.html", "text": "Pension plans across the nation are facing shortfalls, with both corporate plans and those for public employees like teachers and firefighters owing more to retirees than the investment funds can possibly pay. But the looming collapse of the multiemployer pension system is significant given the sheer number of people affected and the potential for a devastating economic ripple effect: retirees losing the pension checks that keep them afloat and a potential wave of bankruptcies among the companies that once employed those workers.\n\nThe situation has been brewing since the 2008 financial crisis, as investments plummeted, leaving many plans in the red. The slow economic recovery and recent stock market rally have not been sufficient to reinvigorate the plans, which are jointly funded by labor unions and employers whose workers participate in them.\n\nAccording to Boston College\u2019s Center for Retirement Research, the nation\u2019s 1,400 multiemployer plans are facing a $553 billion \u201chole\u201d of unfunded liabilities, meaning they don\u2019t have sufficient assets to cover what they owe workers. About a fourth of these plans are in the so-called \u201cred zone,\u201d where insolvency is more imminent, potentially within the next 10 to 20 years. Most of the participants in these plans work in the transportation, services and manufacturing industries. Their employers, many of which have been trying to withdraw from the plans, include companies like United Parcel Service and Kroger.\n\nU.P.S. said in 2016 that it could be responsible for nearly $4 billion in benefits payments if the Central States Pension Fund, the largest multiemployer plan facing insolvency, slashes benefits to retirees or becomes insolvent. In the past year, U.P.S., which participates in more than two dozen pension plans, has been working with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to help develop pension legislation. It has also offered its own proposals.\n\n\u201cWe want the system stabilized and fixed in the long term because we\u2019re in so many plans and we have a lot of employees in the plans,\u201d said Chris Langan, vice president of finance at U.P.S. \u201cIt\u2019s something that is not wise to wait on.\u201d\n\nNow, Congress must decide whether to rescue these funds with low-cost loans, force them to cut benefit payments or let the funds go bankrupt and wipe out retirees\u2019 entire pensions.\n\nMs. Wong and other advocates of congressional action say they are optimistic that the committee can achieve rare bipartisan success. Members of Congress across the aisle, they say, are coming to grips with the cost of doing nothing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis committee forces Congress to get serious,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, a longtime champion of unions who represents many retirees covered by the pension plans, and who fought for the committee\u2019s creation in the spending bill. \u201cIt forces us to come together and work out differences.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe strain on the multiemployer pension system carries another risk \u2014 the potential annihilation of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the government agency that insures pension plans. The P.B.G.C. said in its latest annual report that its multiemployer program is likely to run out of money by the end of fiscal year 2025 because of the \u201crapid decline\u201d in the P.B.G.C.\u2019s financial position. In 2017, the agency paid $141 million in financial assistance to 72 multiemployer pension plans and that number is expected to rise as more plans collapse.\n\nIf the multiemployer pension plans go broke, the federal safety net created to protect retirees will not have enough money to make good on the promised benefits, leaving workers with little to no retirement benefits.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an urgent problem that needs to be fixed,\u201d said Alicia H. Munnell, a management professor at Boston College and the director of its Center for Retirement Research. \u201cUnfortunately there\u2019s an ideological divide \u2014 do you bail these people out or not?\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Retirees, already squeezed by living on a fixed income, are frustrated at the prospect of seeing their benefits reduced or eliminated if Congress does not act, he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they understand, when they take money away from us, how much they\u2019re going to hurt the economy.\u201d\n\nMr. Walden called the creation of the committee a \u201cmeaningful step\u201d to soothe nervous retirees. \u201cIt\u2019s been way too long \u2014 just talk, talk, talk, talk,\u201d he said.\n\nTo succeed, the committee must navigate Washington\u2019s aversion to anything that resembles a bailout, particularly as the government is running large deficits that are projected to grow $7 trillion over the next decade \u2014 and when many Republicans see unions as political enemies.\n\nAnd Congress has already tried to help these plans, with little success. In 2014, the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act was enacted to help funds develop rescue plans, including by reducing benefits to retirees. In 2015, Central States submitted such a plan to the Treasury Department, but it was rejected the following year on the grounds that the proposed benefit reductions were unlikely to help the fund avoid insolvency.\n\nMr. Brown and Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, a Democrat, have pushed an effort that would attempt to stabilize plans with 30-year loans from the Treasury Department, as long as plan managers could demonstrate the money would put them on a path to solvency \u2014 and not invest it in risky assets. Fiscal hawks, like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, warn that the bill could leave taxpayers responsible for as much as $100 billion if the loans are not repaid. Backers of the bill say taxpayers should not end up paying a dime.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis is beyond party affiliation, this really cuts to the root of what retirement is going to look like,\u201d said Mr. Neal, who will be a member of the special committee and has been working to recruit more House Republicans to support his proposal.\n\nMr. Neal has six Republican co-sponsors on his bill and said that several others have expressed support. A handful of Republican senators have also been engaged on the issue, including Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, who said this month that she was pleased the spending bill \u201crecognizes the urgent need to help tens of thousands of retired coal miners.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has been largely quiet on the situation, but when asked about it at a congressional hearing last week, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, noted that it was a \u201csignificant\u201d issue and promised to offer technical assistance to support any solution that lawmakers find.\n\nAs congressional negotiators homed in on a spending deal early this year, Mr. Brown pushed Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, to attach his pension language to the larger budget agreement. The bill establishes a process to ensure that if the commission produces a bill supported by a majority of its Democratic and Republican members, the Senate will vote on that bill before a new Congress convenes next year.\n\nIf concern over retirees is not enough to get lawmakers to act, those who represent pension funds hope that concern about the broader economy will. Michael D. Scott, executive director for the National Coordinating Committee for Multiemployer Plans, projects that if all of the pension plans that are in \u201ccritical\u201d and \u201ccritical and declining\u201d condition go broke, the federal government would face a half trillion dollars in lost tax revenue over the next decade because of the taxes that the active funds currently pay.\n\n\u201cI think ultimately the government is going to look at how much tax revenue it is going to lose without a solution,\u201d Mr. Scott said.", "keywords": ["help", "multiemployer", "funds", "await", "retirement", "plans", "bill", "million", "fix", "committee", "congress", "15", "bomb", "retirees", "pension", "congressional"], "polarity": 0.08310142238713669, "subjectivity": 0.40176735466914026},

That became a laughing point, not a talking point, a laughing point.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Time magazine that December, Mr. Trump, then the president-elect, rejected the notion of Russian interference, even as he entertained the possibility but then suggested other culprits:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe they interfered. That became a laughing point, not a talking point, a laughing point. Anytime I do something, they say, \u2018Oh, Russia interfered.\u2019 Why not get along with Russia? And they can help us fight ISIS, which is both costly in lives and costly in money. And they\u2019re effective and smart. It could be Russia. And it could be China. And it could be some guy in his home in New Jersey. I believe that it could have been Russia and it could have been any one of many other people.

Why wasn\u2019t this brought up before election?\u201d he wrote.\n\nOn Dec. 29, outgoing President Barack Obama issued sanctions against Russia and ejected 35 suspected Russian intelligence operatives from the United States. Two days later, Mr. Trump said he still wasn\u2019t convinced that Moscow had played a role in the vote:\n\n\u201cAnd I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So it could be somebody else,\u201d he said to reporters in Palm Beach, Fla.\n\nJanuary 2017: \u201cRussia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyberinfrastructure of our governmental institutions.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 6, the intelligence community released an unclassified report about Russia\u2019s multifaceted attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election. After being briefed on the full report that day, Mr. Trump pointed to \u201cRussia, China, other countries, outside groups and people.\u201d\n\nMay: \u201cIf Russia did anything having to do with our election, I want to know about it.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with NBC\u2019s Lester Holt, Mr. Trump spoke of Russian interference as a hypothetical possibility:\n\nMr. Trump: \u201cIf Russia hacked \u2014 if Russia did anything having to do with our election, I want to know about it.\u201d Mr. Holt: \u201cWell, there\u2019s already \u2014 there\u2019s already intelligence from virtually every intelligence agency that yes, that happened.\u201d Mr. Trump: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you this.

The official said these random comments, as he described them, reflected a lack of understanding by the White House of the European project, and he put them down to Mr. Trump\u2019s long-held belief that America\u2019s allies take advantage of the United States on trade.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Nicholas Burns, a former American ambassador to NATO now at Harvard, said, \u201cIt is a mistake for the U.S. to make this an issue.\u201d\n\nThe real task is getting Europeans to spend more efficiently and usefully on defense, he said, given the threats from Russia. \u201cBut the E.U. is incapable of creating a competitive structure to NATO,\u201d he added.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis conference of trans-Atlantic security experts is the best place for Washington to reassure European allies and send them messages, as Vice President Mike Pence did last year, asserting Mr. Trump\u2019s support for NATO and the principle of collective defense, analysts say.\n\nBut this year, only Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, spoke for the administration, and he said little about Europe. Mr. Mattis and the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, did not speak publicly at all.\n\nFor many years, long before Mr. Trump\u2019s election, the United States pushed European nations to spend more on defense and to take more responsibility for European security. Mr. Trump has ratcheted up the public pressure, and NATO members are now spending more in real terms. By 2024, NATO says, at least 15 of its 29 member nations are expected to hit the collective goal of spending at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense.\n\nThat would be short of the goal of all members spending 2 percent, but it represents significant progress, especially if the money is spent more efficiently and cooperatively.\n\nTo that end, the Obama administration had urged Europe to take more responsibility for itself, with the former assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, Victoria Nuland, saying that the problem was not a strong Europe but a weak one.\n\nBut now, said Ivo Daalder, another former American ambassador to NATO, who now directs the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, the United States is going back to the language of the late 1990s, after Britain and France began a formal defense cooperation. Washington and the Secretary of State at the time, Madeleine Albright, had warned of the \u201cthree D\u2019s\u201d \u2014 the dangers of \u201cdelinking\u201d European efforts from NATO, \u201cduplicating\u201d existing efforts, and \u201cdiscriminating\u201d against nations that are not members of the European Union.\n\nMr. Daalder said that the failure to deliver a clear American message of support for Europe was a mistake. The United States should have welcomed the European initiative and increased spending as \u201ca plus for burden sharing\u201d instead of creating friction, he said.\n\n\u201cBut President Trump and his administration have made it clear that they see a world of competitors, not allies,\u201d Mr. Daalder said. \u201cThey have made it clear they don\u2019t want a strong Europe, but see Europe as a competitor, which can only please Russia.\u201d\n\nThe traditional strength of the United States is that it has allies, Mr. Daalder said, \u201cwhile Russia and China have clients.\u201d", "keywords": ["members", "concerns", "rattling", "europe", "european", "mr", "security", "allies", "plans", "nato", "revives", "american", "defense", "united", "states"], "polarity": 0.05922682337156022, "subjectivity": 0.3118082453608769},

Andrew M. Cuomo has said. \u201cThat is one of the first places I would look to reduce congestion and to raise money.\u201d\n\nEven as President Trump promotes a plan to rebuild the country\u2019s tattered infrastructure, many local governments are not waiting to see what, if any, help Washington provides and are finding novel ways to pay for transportation and other public works projects.\n\nAcross the nation, more than a dozen states and municipalities have imposed fees or taxes on ride-hailing companies or their passengers, or sometimes both, and many more are considering such measures, according to transportation and tax experts. Advocates for the charges contend that the ride-hailing cars should pay for using public streets and resources, contributing to gridlock and pollution, and siphoning passengers and fares from public transit.\n\n\u201cIf they want to share the pie, then they have to pay the price,\u201d said Fayez Khozindar, the executive director of the United Taxidrivers Community Council, an advocacy group for taxi drivers in Chicago. \u201cIt\u2019s fair because we know the city is short on funds and they want to fill the hole.\u201d\n\nBut some drivers and passengers for the ride-hailing companies say they have been unfairly singled out \u2014 in many places the new fees do not apply to taxis.\n\n\u201cUber and Lyft have always been an easy target for cities looking for new streams of revenue,\u201d said Harry Campbell, a driver for Uber and Lyft in California who writes a popular blog, The Rideshare Guy.\n\nIn New York and Chicago, Uber and Lyft have said they see their services as complementing the public transit systems and providing another option for riders, especially in transit deserts with few bus routes and train lines. Uber supports a congestion plan for Manhattan \u2014 even running an ad campaign backing the idea \u2014 as long as it does not single out for-hire vehicles.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cA comprehensive congestion pricing plan that is applied to all vehicles in the central business district is the best way to fully fund mass transit, reduce congestion and improve transportation for outer borough New Yorkers,\u201d an Uber spokeswoman, Alix Anfang, said. \u201cA surcharge alone will not accomplish these goals.\u201d\n\nLast year, New York State approved a 4 percent assessment on ride-hailing trips that begin outside New York City (rides in the city are already subject to state and local taxes). It is expected to raise $24 million a year for the state\u2019s general fund though one state legislator, Senator John E. Brooks, a Democrat from Long Island, has proposed legislation to direct that revenue to local bus and commuter rail services. \u201cWe need to think creatively and outside of the box in order to improve funding for local transit,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new fees and taxes are often part of broader regulatory measures as states and localities scramble to update tax codes and laws that have not kept up with the proliferation of app-based ride services. For instance, a Georgia state tax applies to rides in taxis but not ride-hailing cars even though they essentially do the same thing, said Carl Davis, research director for the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy in Washington.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cA lot of tax codes weren\u2019t set up to take them into account,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cThey\u2019re so new they didn\u2019t even exist a decade ago. It\u2019s an emerging tax issue, and states and localities are playing catch up.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina added a 1 percent fee to ride-hailing trips in 2015, in part to establish a single regulatory framework and block local efforts to charge prohibitively high fees to keep them out, state officials said. Now that fee has become a source of extra cash. The city of North Charleston, for instance, receives more than $30,000 annually and uses it for municipal operations.\n\nIn Oregon, Portland officials initially barred Uber but eventually agreed to allow it and Lyft to operate through pilot programs. In 2016, the city sought to create a single standard for taxis and ride-hailing cars and assessed a 50-cent ride fee on both of them, which is paid by passengers.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The fee \u201chasn\u2019t been a barrier to the riders at all as the ride-hailing services have continued to expand,\u2019\u2019 said Dave Benson, a senior manager for the Portland Bureau of Transportation. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the top yet.\u2019\u2019\n\nStill, many Portland taxi owners and drivers say the fee has hurt them more than their rivals. Noah Ernst, a superintendent for Radio Cab, said many taxi drivers feel the 50-cent fee means a smaller tip because passengers lump everything together when they pay. Taxi companies also face the headache of trying to collect the fee from drivers.\n\nHe added that taxis continued to face more stringent safety, equipment and insurance requirements, and were targeted more often for inspections because their cars were easily identified by company colors and logos.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an equal playing field at all and we were trying to tell them this the entire time they were rewriting the code,\u201d he said.\n\nAs a result, he said, taxi companies are struggling and at least two have gone out of business. His company, Radio Cab, has lost more than a third of its business since 2015.\n\nChicago officials have calculated that ride-hailing companies have cost the city about $40 million a year in lost revenue from transit fares, parking fees, licenses and permits. In 2014, the city imposed a 20-cent fee on ride-hailing trips in response to concerns that taxis were being undercut. Two years later, that fee went up to 50 cents, with an additional two-cent fee paid by the ride-hailing companies themselves. And now, the new 15-cent fee for the transit system brings the total to 65 cents for passengers.\n\nThe city also assessed a separate $5 fee on passengers who were picked up or dropped off by ride-hailing cars at the major airports, the convention center and the Navy Pier, a popular tourist destination.\n\nThe ride-hailing fees produced nearly $39 million for the city\u2019s general fund in 2016, up from about $100,000 in 2014, according to city estimates. Last year\u2019s revenue, which is still being collected, is expected to reach $72 million.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fairly new industry and once they actually got settled in the city we saw a lot of growth,\u201d the Chicago budget director, Samantha Fields, said.\n\nMayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, who has made modernizing the L a priority, said the new 15-cent fee was the first of its kind to raise money solely for public transit from those who might not even use it because they could afford the ride-hailing cars. \u201cI think it\u2019s a progressive transportation tax,\u201d Mr. Emanuel said. \u201cIt will make public transportation competitive with the rideshare industry.\u201d\n\nIn effect, Mr. Emanuel said, it will serve as a \u201cbackdoor approach\u201d to fighting congestion created by the ride-hailing cars by helping shift more people \u2014 by their own choice \u2014 to the transit system. \u201cThere\u2019s a congestion fee and I would just say the rideshare fee is kind of parallel parking into the same position,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe 15-cent fee is projected to bring in $16 million this year, which will be turned over to the Chicago Transit Authority. The money will be used to secure additional funding through bond sales to pay for a total of $179 million in capital improvements, according to city officials.\n\nKyle Whitehead, the government relations director for Active Transportation Alliance, a Chicago advocacy group for biking, walking and transit, said that the transit system contributes to the health of the city by getting more people out of cars, increasing exercise levels and reducing pollution \u2014 and it is now in dire need of money.\n\n\u201cThe public transit system benefits everyone who lives and works in the city, he said, \u201cregardless of whether they\u2019re using it.\u201d", "keywords": ["transit", "ridehailing", "public", "cities", "transportation", "tax", "cars", "uber", "city", "pay", "fee", "states", "calling", "companies"], "polarity": 0.15010715260715263, "subjectivity": 0.37249288249288265},

A graduate of Nascar\u2019s Drive for Diversity program, Darrell Wallace Jr., 24, could give stock car racing something it has never had before: an African-American star.\n\nBut that is not why Richard Petty brought Wallace onto his team. Late last season, Wallace, who goes by the nickname Bubba, got four rides with Richard Petty Motorsports. It was enough for Petty, one of Nascar\u2019s most iconic names, to not only give Wallace a full-time ride, but also to give him his famed No. 43 racecar to drive. Wallace is the first African-American to drive full-time in the top Nascar series since Wendell Scott in 1971.\n\nPetty insisted, though, that he is colorblind when it comes to evaluating talent. Sure, it would be great if Wallace brings the sport into the African-American community, but as far as Petty is concerned, that\u2019s secondary.\n\n\u201cI hope he advances us as a race team,\u201d Petty said in an email. \u201cI care about what Bubba can do behind the wheel for us. The rest, there are a lot of eyes on Bubba, but he\u2019s handling it well. I know come Sunday he\u2019ll be ready to get into a racecar and just show his talent. If he does well, the rest will come and he\u2019ll grow our fan base.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThose eyes on Wallace, much as they were on Tiger Woods a generation ago, prompted Earnhardt to call him last week. The son of racing legend, Earnhardt knows all about the pressure of expectations.\n\n\u201cHe told me that the next few weeks will basically be hell with all the off-the-track stuff,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cBut he said it\u2019ll all be worth it because I have an opportunity to do things outside the sport that not many other drivers will ever say they\u2019ve had that kind of opportunity to do.

But there\u2019s also venturing out into a different market, into different avenues where the African-American culture lives. We all have to do better at that.\u201d\n\nThere are challenges, of course. On social media, where vulgar epithets can be spewed from faceless and fictitious monikers, Wallace has, at times, had to think twice before responding. He admits he has not always been successful.\n\n\u201cThere is always going to be haters out there, people who don\u2019t want to see you succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that since Day 1 from my parents. Just keep your head down and keep moving, that\u2019s the best you can do.\u201d\n\nBlaney, his closest friend on the circuit, has been around Wallace when offensive remarks have been made.\n\n\u201cThankfully, it\u2019s very, very rare, but it upsets me,\u201d Blaney said. \u201cBubba\u2019s great at handling it. He\u2019s an amazing ambassador for the sport. And he\u2019s really talented and a heck of a competitor. All of us are competitive, but his competitiveness is unlike anyone I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nNascar\u2019s diversity has become an issue again after its only female racer, Danica Patrick, announced she will retire from the circuit after the Daytona 500. But Wallace is not the only driver who can energize an overlooked community. What he can do for an African-American audience, Su\u00e1rez can do for the Latino market. A native of Monterrey, Mexico, Su\u00e1rez said he had noticed an uptick in social media messages from a variety of Latino countries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually either people who tell me they\u2019re now following the sport because of me, or they\u2019ve been fans and now they have a driver to root for,\u201d said Su\u00e1rez, who is also a graduate of the Drive for Diversity program. \u201cThe potential is huge. This is the most diverse country in the world, but we have to improve diversity in Nascar. If we can make the sport more diverse, we\u2019ll see the same thing with fans. More diversity on the racetrack will mean more diversity in the stands.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Nascar waits, wondering who will emerge as its next star.", "keywords": ["waits", "nascar", "su\u00e1rez", "wallace", "hes", "emerge", "generation", "africanamerican", "sport", "leader", "racing", "drive", "diversity", "petty"], "polarity": 0.13599389129389128, "subjectivity": 0.4590651755651755},

And Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, after saying he would not run again and ridiculing Mr. Trump, indicated this past week that he may not retire after all.\n\nMr. Corker\u2019s public misgivings, however, have complicated the Tennessee race, where Representative Marsha Blackburn, a staunch conservative, was already lining up support, and where Democrats landed a formidable candidate, former Gov. Phil Bredesen.\n\nMr. McConnell, who is close to Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, an ally of Mr. Corker, was guarded in his comments about the election, but he chuckled when pressed on the incumbent\u2019s apparent change of heart.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt does underscore that people want to be in the Senate,\u201d he said, trying to make the best of what could become a messy primary contest. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a different environment from late summer, early fall,\u201d when the Republicans were stung by their failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nEqually delicate is the fate of Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi, who at 80 has had a series of health problems and whose seat is being eyed by a hard-line state senator, Chris McDaniel, who nearly beat him in a bitter 2014 primary race.\n\nMr. McConnell called it \u201cpremature\u201d to assess the prospect of a special election this year to replace Mr. Cochran, but did acknowledge that \u201cthere could be\u201d one. \u201cIt\u2019s up to Senator Cochran to make that decision,\u201d he said.\n\nPrivately, though, Republicans are already scrambling to protect Mr. Cochran\u2019s seat. Party leaders fear that a candidacy by Mr. McDaniel could create a competitive race, and perhaps even spiral into a debacle similar to what happened in Alabama last year, when Roy S. Moore\u2019s loss gave the state\u2019s Democrats their first Senate election victory in 25 years.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Phil Bryant of Mississippi found himself buttonholed by the president, who, citing the Moore disaster, said that Mr. Bryant should appoint himself to Mr. Cochran\u2019s seat should it become vacant, according to a Republican official briefed on the conversation.\n\nMr. McConnell has also privately encouraged Mr. Bryant to take the seat if it becomes available, but the governor has so far resisted the entreaties. Republicans close to Mr. Cochran, who is the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, say that while he is not ruling out stepping down this year, he will not contemplate quitting until Congress finishes its 2018 spending bill next month.\n\nMore broadly, Mr. McConnell said he was open to intervening in some party primary contests, as he did in the Tea Party era, but would do so on a state-by-state basis.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe made clear he was supporting Representative Martha McSally of Arizona, who is running against a pair of immigration hawks to replace Senator Jeff Flake. And he said he did not want to see Don Blankenship, the former coal mine owner imprisoned for violating federal mine safety standards, become the party\u2019s standard-bearer against Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia.\n\nMr. McConnell harshly criticized a series of red-state Democrats, but took repeated aim at Mr. Manchin, with whom he has tangled in the past and is plainly eager to beat in a state that has otherwise embraced the Republican Party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cJoe thinks he can just kind of talk his way through all of this, but talk is really cheap when your record doesn\u2019t meet the rhetoric,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, noting Mr. Manchin\u2019s opposition to a series of Republican measures, including the tax bill.\n\nMr. McConnell acknowledged that some of his candidates were struggling to raise money \u2014 \u201cI concede the fund-raising problem,\u201d he said. But he said it was largely the result of having to face so many incumbents, who are typically better able to draw donors.\n\nStill, he said that a Supreme Court case, scheduled to be argued on Feb. 26, that is expected to curb the ability of public sector unions to automatically deduct dues from their members could have an impact on Democratic fund-raising.\n\nHe called the case \u201can example\u201d of why he had found it so important to block former President Barack Obama from replacing Antonin Scalia on the court after his death in 2016, a move that Democrats remain bitter about.\n\nAnd, without being prompted, Mr. McConnell said he hoped that the court would broadly address what he described as the left\u2019s effort to outlaw gerrymandering.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think the founding fathers had in mind when they gave it to the state legislatures?\u201d he said of redistricting powers. \u201cThey thought it was going to be a political exercise.\u201d\n\nWhile eager to trumpet the tax measure, Mr. McConnell said that \u201cthe single best thing we\u2019ve done, in conjunction with the administration, are the court appointments,\u201d including that of Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.\n\nAnd even though he and Mr. Trump heatedly clashed over the summer, Mr. McConnell said he had \u201cno complaint\u201d about the president today.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s re-election, however, will not be Mr. McConnell\u2019s top priority in 2020: The famously competitive senator, who will be 78 at that point, revealed that he is fully committed to running for re-election and chided this reporter for not assuming as much.", "keywords": ["mcconnell", "mr", "trump", "democrats", "senate", "romneys", "republicans", "republican", "senator", "seat", "state", "candidacy"], "polarity": 0.1384586940836941, "subjectivity": 0.395093795093795},

At every level of society, people have grown accustomed to kickbacks and political connections determining who prospers, and who goes without.\n\nMr. Zuma\u2019s demise resonates as a sign of a potential new order taking shape. He will forever be linked to his association with the Guptas, three Indian-born brothers who effectively bought key levers of governmental power, amassing influence so comprehensive that it became known as \u201cstate capture.\u201d\n\nHis resignation has raised hopes that South Africa is finally contending with its epidemic of corruption. That view gained momentum when an elite police unit raided a home belonging to the Guptas nearly at the same moment that Mr. Ramaphosa was assuming office.\n\nThe new president is a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle, a former deputy president and chairman of the National Planning Commission, a focal point for thinking about how to engineer economic growth.

At the time, Mr. Ramaphosa occupied a seat on the board of Lonmin, the company that owned the mine. Emails soon surfaced showing that, a day before the police opened fire, Mr. Ramaphosa had been urging senior government officials to take strong action to end the strike.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, no corruption charges have stuck to the new president, who now claims a mandate to clean up the toxic mess left behind by Mr. Zuma.\n\nSome doubt whether the A.N.C. can be salvaged as an effective vehicle for egalitarian policymaking. The party\u2019s executive ranks include many figures implicated in corruption.

It ensured that huge numbers of uneducated black South Africans were available at poverty-level wages within major sectors of the economy like mining, agriculture and textiles. That cushioned domestic companies from the pressure to modernize.\n\nPhoto\n\nInternational sanctions isolated South Africa, shielding its firms from competition against multinational rivals. Sanctions also denied South African companies the ability to operate abroad, giving them an incentive to focus on the domestic market. The apartheid-era government obliged with subsidies for favored firms while allowing companies to pursue oligopoly, free of nuisances like antitrust law.\n\nThe result was a system in which large industries, from retail to furniture-making to chemicals, were dominated by huge enterprises whose core strength was the ability to protect themselves against competition. That system has largely prevailed, with smaller companies and start-ups facing often-impossible odds.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cApartheid was a system that lends itself to large conglomerates and concentrations of wealth in the hands of a few,\u201d Mr. Cawe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the corruption.

Credit Eric Risberg/Associated Press\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In 2014, Russians working for a shadowy firm called the Internet Research Agency started gathering American followers in online groups focused on issues like religion and immigration. Around mid-2015, the Russians began buying digital ads to spread their messages. A year later, they tapped their followers to help organize political rallies across the United States.\n\nTheir digital instrument of choice for all of these actions? Facebook and its photo-sharing site Instagram.\n\nThe social network, more than any other technology tool, was singled out on Friday by the Justice Department when prosecutors charged 13 Russians and three companies for executing a scheme to subvert the 2016 election and support Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. In a 37-page indictment, officials detailed how the Russians repeatedly turned to Facebook and Instagram, often using stolen identities to pose as Americans, to sow discord among the electorate by creating Facebook groups, distributing divisive ads and posting inflammatory images.\n\nWhile the indictment does not accuse Facebook of any wrongdoing, it provided the first comprehensive account from the authorities of how critical the company\u2019s platforms had been to the Russian campaign to disrupt the 2016 election. Facebook and Instagram were mentioned 41 times, while other technology that the Russians used was featured far less. Twitter was referred to nine times, YouTube once and the electronic payments company PayPal 11 times.\n\nIt is unprecedented for an American technology company to be so central to what the authorities say was a foreign scheme to commit election fraud in the United States. The indictment further batters Facebook\u2019s image after it has spent months grappling with questions about how it was misused and why it did not act earlier to prevent that activity.\n\nJonathan Albright, research director at Columbia University\u2019s Tow Center for Digital Journalism, said the indictment laid bare how effectively Facebook could be turned against the country.\n\nImage Russians used inflammatory posts and ads on Facebook ahead of the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cFacebook built incredibly effective tools which let Russia profile citizens here in the U.S. and figure out how to manipulate us,\u201d Mr. Albright said. \u201cFacebook, essentially, gave them everything they needed.\u201d He added that many of the tools that the Russians used, including those that allow ads to be targeted and that show how widespread an ad becomes, still pervade Facebook.\n\nFacebook, with more than two billion members on the social network alone, has long struggled with what its sites show and the kind of illicit activity it may enable, from selling unlicensed guns to broadcasting live killings. The company\u2019s business depends on people being highly engaged with what is posted on its sites, which in turn helps make it a marquee destination for advertisers.\n\nWhen suggestions first arose after the 2016 election that Facebook may have influenced the outcome, Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, dismissed the concerns. But by last September, Facebook had disclosed that the Internet Research Agency had bought divisive ads on hot-button issues through the company. It later said 150 million Americans had seen the Russian propaganda on the social network and Instagram.\n\nThe resulting firestorm has damaged Facebook\u2019s reputation. Company officials, along with executives from Google and YouTube, were grilled by lawmakers last fall. Facebook has since hired thousands of people to help monitor content and has worked with Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel leading the investigation into Russian election interference. It has also changed its advertising policy so that any ad that mentions a candidate\u2019s name goes through a more stringent vetting process. Mr. Zuckerberg has vowed to not let Facebook be abused by bad actors.\n\nYet Facebook\u2019s multiple mentions in Friday\u2019s indictment renew questions of why the world\u2019s biggest social media company didn\u2019t catch the Russian activity earlier or do more to stop it. How effective the company\u2019s new efforts to reduce foreign manipulation have been is also unclear.\n\nRob Goldman, Facebook\u2019s vice president of advertising, waded into the discussion on Friday with a series of tweets that argued that Russia\u2019s goal was to sow chaos among the electorate rather than to force a certain outcome in the election. On Saturday, President Trump cited those tweets as evidence that Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign was not aimed at handing him a victory.\n\n\u201cI have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal.\u201d\n\nRob Goldman\n\nVice President of Facebook Ads https://t.co/A5ft7cGJkE \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2018\n\nIn Silicon Valley, where Facebook has its headquarters, some critics pilloried the company after the indictment became public.\n\n\u201cMueller\u2019s indictment underscores the central role of Facebook and other platforms in the Russian interference in 2016,\u201d said Roger McNamee, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who had invested early in Facebook. \u201cIn its heyday, television brought the country together, giving viewers a shared set of facts and experiences. Facebook does just the opposite, enabling every user to have a unique set of facts, driving the country apart for profit.\u201d\n\nJoel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global policy, said in a statement that the company was grateful the government was taking action \u201cagainst those who abused our service and exploited the openness of our democratic process.\u201d\n\nHe added that Facebook was working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation ahead of this year\u2019s midterm elections to ensure that a similar manipulation campaign would not take place. \u201cWe know we have more to do to prevent against future attacks,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook has previously questioned whether law enforcement should be more involved in helping to stop the threat from nation state actors. Facebook said it worked closely with the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\n\nYouTube did not respond to a request for comment, while Twitter declined to comment. PayPal said in a statement that it has worked closely with law enforcement and \u201cis intensely focused on combating and preventing the illicit use of our services.\u201d\n\nAccording to the indictment, the Internet Research Agency, created in 2014 in St. Petersburg and employing about 80 people, was given the job of interfering with elections and political processes.\n\nThe group began using American social media to achieve those aims in 2014, when it started making Facebook pages dedicated to social issues like race and religion. Over the next two years, the indictment said, the Russians stole the identities of real Americans to create fake personas and fake accounts on social media. The group then used those to populate and promote Facebook pages like United Muslims of America, Blacktivist and Secured Borders.\n\nBy 2016, the indictment said, the size of some of these Russian-controlled Facebook groups had ballooned to hundreds of thousands of followers.\n\nImage Facebook was also used by the Russians to organize political rallies in the United States.\n\nThe Russians then used these groups to push various messages, including telling Americans not to vote in the 2016 election for either Mr. Trump or his opponent, Hillary Clinton. In October 2016, according to the indictment, one Russian-controlled Instagram account called Woke Blacks posted a message saying: \u201cHatred for Trump is misleading the people and forcing Blacks to vote Killary. We cannot resort to the lesser of two devils. Then we\u2019d surely be better off without voting AT ALL.\u201d\n\nAround 2015, according to the indictment, the Russians also started purchasing ads on Facebook and other social media sites like Twitter, targeting specific communities within the United States. The group used stolen PayPal accounts to pay for the ads and to promote posts, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on the outreach.\n\nIn one ad, published to promote a Facebook event called \u201cDown with Hillary,\u201d an image of Mrs. Clinton was shown with a black \u201cX\u201d painted across her face. The text read, \u201cHillary Clinton is the co-author of Obama\u2019s anti-police and anti-Constitutional propaganda.\u201d\n\nBy mid-2016, according to the indictment, the Russians were using their fake Facebook personas to organize political rallies in the United States. That June, for example, posing as the United Muslims of America on Facebook, they promoted a rally called \u201cSupport Hillary. Save American Muslims.\u201d For an August 2016 event organized through Facebook, the Russians also paid for a cage to be built that was large enough to hold an actress depicting Mrs. Clinton in a prison uniform.\n\nAt every step, the Russians used Facebook\u2019s own tools to make sure their propaganda was as effective as possible. Those tools allowed them to get real-time results on which types of ad campaigns were reaching their target audience or which posts were getting the most engagement with viewers.\n\nResearchers said that those tools are still widely available and that while the company has worked to remove fake accounts and stem the flow of disinformation, it has refused to let outside researchers examine the data on how Russian actors used the platform so effectively.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking steps to fix this, but there\u2019s no easy solution,\u201d Anton Vuljaj, a Republican media strategist who has advised campaigns and media groups, said of Facebook and other social media companies. \u201cThis also shows that the public needs to be more vigilant about what is real and what is not online.\u201d\n\n\n\nSheera Frenkel reported from San Francisco, and Katie Benner from Washington.

The aggressive pace of deportations of immigrants of color, the elimination of the DACA program protecting immigrant children and the proposals propounded by the anti-immigration voices in the administration will all have the undeniable effect of slowing the rapid racial diversification of the United States population. Despite this sweeping attempt at racial social engineering, few voices in progressive and Democratic circles are responding with the kinds of outrage that one would expect.\n\nThe pro-white preferences of Donald Trump and his administration, especially when it comes to immigration, are legion. From the day he opened his presidential campaign in 2015 by demonizing Mexicans to the enthusiasm generated by the calls for building a wall along the Mexican border to aggressively ramping up deportations of immigrants of color to eliminating DACA to vulgarly denigrating African nations and Haiti, this administration has been quite clear about its preference for white people.\n\nIt should be no surprise, then, that the immigration policies championed by the White House would all have the effect of reducing the number of people of color coming into the country. A recent study by The Washington Post found that the administration\u2019s proposals to curtail legal immigration by limiting family reunification would slightly delay the date when whites become a minority. \u201cBy greatly slashing the number of Hispanic and black African immigrants entering America, this proposal would reshape the future United States,\u201d the economist Michael Clemens said.\n\n\u201cDecades ahead,\u201d he added, \u201cmany fewer of us would be nonwhite or have nonwhite people in our families.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe administration\u2019s focus is not random. Nor is it illogical, if one\u2019s goal is to maximize the influence of white people. Since the passage of the 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act, the chromatic composition of the country\u2019s population has undergone a fundamental transformation. People of color used to make up 12 percent of the United States population in 1965, and that percentage has more than tripled over the past several decades to the point where nonwhite people are nearly 39 percent of the residents of the United States (it is no accident that the country\u2019s first African-American president was elected when he was elected).

The very first immigration law passed, the Naturalization Act of 1790, declared that to become a citizen, one had to be a \u201cfree white person.\u201d That demarcation was the explicit law of the land for the next 162 years, until 1952. There are 20th-century Supreme Court cases explicitly holding that Asian immigrants could not become United States citizens because they were not white.

He said the United States would retaliate, but did not say how, adding \u201cwe will not telegraph these punches.\u201d\n\nMr. Joyce is no newcomer to offensive cyberoperations; previously he ran the Tailored Access Operations unit of the National Security Agency, overseeing American cyberaction against other counties. \u201cWe are going to conduct cyberoperations,\u201d he said. But \u201cwe need to do it in a responsible, balanced way.\u201d\n\nGeneral McMaster, in his comments, argued that Russia had bridged the partisan divides in the United States, citing a 98 to 2 vote in the Senate to impose Russian sanctions. He did not mention that the administration has yet to impose those sanctions, saying the threat of them alone has begun to change Russian behavior.\n\n\u201cThat sanctions bill has not yet been used as a tool against the Russians,\u201d Christopher Painter, a former coordinator for cyberissues at the State Department, who also attended the conference. \u201cThe question now is whether they will actually use it to create consequences. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nGeneral McMaster was questioned by the chairman of the foreign affairs committee of Russian Federation Council, the country\u2019s equivalent of the Senate, about whether the United States was ready to enter into some kind of negotiation with Russia about the use of cyberweapons.\n\nIt was not the time for that yet, General McMaster said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m surprised there are any Russian cyberexperts available based on how active they have been in undermining the democracies\u201d of the world.", "keywords": ["intelligence", "trumps", "trump", "security", "chief", "mr", "russia", "interference", "national", "incontrovertible", "main", "kislyak", "russians", "calls", "russian", "united", "states"], "polarity": 0.07154555003819708, "subjectivity": 0.3940413059163059},

Almost all of those who led the campaign to bring him to account were black, like Thuli Madonsela, the former public protector, who played a heroic role in exposing Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption. South Africa\u2019s judiciary, which is majority black, defended the independence of the courts with extraordinary courage and under great pressure. After this display of black courage, why would it matter what white people think?\n\nBut South Africa is too fraught and complex a place for such a simple story to ring true. More plausible is that each pinprick penetrating Mr. Zuma\u2019s skin is felt by black South Africans, even those who are horrified by what he has done.\n\nBeneath the surface of public life, one can detect a strange, subliminal to-and-fro. Last year, for instance, a superb book describing in meticulous detail the deep corruption of the late apartheid years, \u201cApartheid Guns and Money,\u201d by Hennie van Vuuren, was a runaway best seller. It deserved to be widely read, but the scale of its success is partly a function of its utility as a weapon against white arrogance. \u201cHowever bad Zuma is,\u201d its many black readers could say to themselves, \u201cyou people were worse.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

For the truth is that Mr. Zuma and his allies were corrupt partly because they felt a sense of grievance intimately connected to their experience of race.\n\nWhen Mr. Zuma became president of South Africa in 2009, he rallied behind him an alliance of people who felt themselves to be marginal and neglected, not just in relation to the world economic order or white South Africa but also in relation to the A.N.C. itself. The A.N.C. has been run by people drawn from the ranks of an urbane, cosmopolitan elite.\n\nMr. Zuma represented a dramatic change in this tradition. Although he spent years in exile and climbed the ranks of the A.N.C., his biography was unlike any of his predecessors\u2019. Nelson Mandela was born into royalty. Thabo Mbeki was the son of prominent intellectuals. Mr. Zuma\u2019s mother worked in the kitchen of a white family and was too poor to provide her son with a formal education. He grew up herding cattle in the hinterland.\n\nWhen he came to power in 2009, he did so with the support of organizations representing much of the urban working class \u2014 the country\u2019s largest trade union and the South African Communist Party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut he soon dropped these organizations and turned for support to rural South Africa, in particular to traditional leaders and to the elites of far-flung provincial capitals. They carried with them into power an abiding sense of powerlessness, a feeling that the very institutions they now controlled were alien and belonged to others. In office, they believed that they had entered into their enemy\u2019s mansion. It seemed to be payback time.\n\nIn a speech delivered to a room of black businesspeople in December 2016, Mr. Zuma warned of the sophisticated ways in which the enemy confuses black people. One source of such confusion was the prevailing economic orthodoxy. Mr. Zuma suggested that the most fundamental of economic laws was merely nominal; remove the scales from our eyes and we see that so-called economic laws are a ruse invented by the powerful.\n\nHis genre of criminality is light-years from the sort that characterized the apartheid state. The corruption of apartheid\u2019s leaders stemmed from arrogance; they believed that they could control the world forever. Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption stems from the grievances of a man who feels very small.\n\nThis sense of grievance was on display in the last words he uttered publicly as president. In a swipe at his successor, Mr. Ramaphosa, Mr. Zuma suggested that those in the party who had unseated him were \u201cserving the interests of the oppressors of yesteryear, who joyfully celebrate as we lynch one another.\u201d\n\nBlack nationalism in South Africa has many faces. Mr. Ramaphosa represents a strand that is bourgeois, worldly and comfortable with power. There is also a militant, socialist strand of black nationalism, but it is on the wane. And there is the strand represented by Mr. Zuma, who governed as a man shaped and distorted by the violence and oppression of white supremacy.\n\nI am of course alive to the irony of a white South African like me saying that a black president\u2019s corruption was motivated by racial grievance. Many South Africans, black and white, would regard this argument as an excuse for the intolerable. But we should be honest enough to accept that even now, notwithstanding that apartheid has been gone since before nearly half the South African population was born, the legacy of white supremacy has lived on in the man who was president.", "keywords": ["zuma", "mr", "black", "distinctive", "apartheid", "corruption", "mess", "white", "africa", "jacob", "zumas", "whats", "economic", "south"], "polarity": 0.0616115067727971, "subjectivity": 0.37158776707163793},

Cities like Chicago and Baltimore, with rigorous gun laws, also have two of the highest murder rates in the country. The black market for illegal guns has thrived in those cities, with gang members and criminals turning to the streets to get firearms.\n\nAnd the drop in fatal shootings in Connecticut has occurred in the context of a broad, long-term decline in violent crime across the country. Citing F.B.I. statistics, the Pew Research Center reports that violent crime fell 48 percent from 1993 to 2016.\n\nGun-rights groups say the problem is not the guns, but the individuals using them. They argue that laws alone are no panacea, and that social issues like mental illness and unemployment must be addressed to help curb gun violence. Some gun advocates have also called for more training and security for those who legally and responsibly maintain guns.\n\nStill, with little appetite in Congress to take on gun control, the debate is playing out at the state level, with Connecticut seen as a model for gun-control advocates.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cConnecticut\u2019s laws are among the nation\u2019s toughest and homicides are down,\u201d Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said. \u201cObviously the link is a circumstantial one; cause and effect can\u2019t be proven conclusively. But the numbers are all in the right direction. States like Connecticut can help shame Congress into adopting common-sense measures that keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people.\u201d\n\nState officials say Connecticut has experienced the fastest drop in violent crime of any state over the last four years. Gun-control advocates say the suspect in Florida, Nikolas Cruz, could not have bought the AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle believed used in the attack, or the high-capacity magazines, in Connecticut.\n\n\u201cWe really need to do a better job at making sure we have strong gun laws in every state in the country, because we are losing our most valuable resource, which is our children,\u201d said Jeremy I. Stein, the executive director of CT Against Gun Violence, a nonprofit advocacy group.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven in Connecticut, where parents of the children killed at Sandy Hook met with lawmakers as they debated the legislation, the measures fell short of what gun-control advocates wanted. For example, the laws did not force residents to relinquish existing assault weapons and high-capacity magazines or limit the number of firearms people could own.\n\nAt a hearing a month after the Newtown shooting, some speakers talked of the need to hold people accountable. \u201cThe problem is not gun laws. The problem is a lack of civility,\u201d said Mark Mattioli, whose son James, 6, was killed at Sandy Hook Elementary.\n\nThe Giffords Center, which keeps a state-by-state report card, gave Connecticut an A-minus for its gun laws \u2014 the same grade given to New York, which moved even more swiftly after Sandy Hook to pass stricter laws. The center ranked Connecticut 46th and New York 48th for their gun death rates, among the five lowest in the United States.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIn New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed a law a month after the massacre at Sandy Hook that is, in some respects, stricter than the one in Connecticut. The New York law not only bans the sale of assault weapons and imposes universal background checks, it also prohibits both the sale \u2014 and possession \u2014 of magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds. And it requires mental health professionals to alert the authorities about at-risk patients who should not be allowed to buy a firearm. As of Feb. 8, 77,447 people deemed to be dangerously mentally ill had been added to the database.\n\nAvery W. Gardiner, a president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said that generally, blue states are, not surprisingly, more likely to regulate guns and require background checks and licensing. Conservative red states either lack gun-safety laws or fail to enforce the ones they have. Her group\u2019s strategy includes filing lawsuits to enforce existing safety laws and countering the gun lobby, which uses its muscle in statehouses as well as Congress.\n\nThe lobbying has been hard on both sides. According to the nonpartisan National Institute on Money in State Politics, in the past three election cycles the National Rifle Association, the nation\u2019s leading gun lobby, spent a total of $10.6 million to support candidates for state office in 25 states. Between 2009 and 2016, at least two-thirds of that spending went to state contests in which the group\u2019s chosen candidate won.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cFlorida has gone the wrong way since Sandy Hook for sensible laws,\u201d Ms. Gardiner said, citing a Florida law that would have restricted doctors from even asking patients about gun safety. The Brady Center sued Florida on the grounds that the law violated the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of free speech, and a year ago a panel of federal judges ruled in the center\u2019s favor.\n\nIn Connecticut, the question of magazine capacity became emotionally charged as the stricter gun laws were being debated. That is because the Sandy Hook attacker, Adam Lanza, like other mass gunmen, used high-capacity magazines that allowed him to rapidly fire 30 rounds. A group of first graders at Sandy Hook ran past Mr. Lanza, escaping from the hail of bullets when he had to stop and reload.\n\nAt a news conference in April 2013, on the day lawmakers announced an agreement on gun control, Nicole Hockley, whose son, Dylan, died at Sandy Hook, said: \u201cWe ask ourselves every day \u2014 every minute \u2014 if those magazines had held 10 rounds, forcing the shooter to reload at least six more times, would our children be alive today?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nConnecticut\u2019s sweeping gun laws did, however, require residents who already owned high-capacity magazines and assault rifles to register them with the State Police. Today, the registry lists 52,648 assault weapons. A single resident registered 179 assault weapons, while another registered more than 500,000 magazines exceeding the 10-round limit. Between 2013 and 2017, 248 people were charged with illegally possessing an assault weapon because they either failed to register an existing weapon or had bought a weapon after the law went into effect.\n\nThe state also requires that individuals admitted to psychiatric hospitals relinquish their guns, at least temporarily. The State Police is notified of such patients by the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, which maintains a database, and ensures that upon discharge, the gun owner turns in the weapon or transfers it to someone eligible for a gun permit. In addition, people who were previously treated in a mental hospital cannot get a permit for up to two years afterward.\n\nThe National Shooting Sports Foundation, a lobby group in Newtown, Conn., declined to comment on the impact of Connecticut\u2019s gun laws \u201cout of respect for the families, the community and the ongoing law enforcement investigation\u201d in Parkland, Fla. The National Rifle Association did not respond to a request to comment.\n\nConnecticut is also one of a few states with another gun law with some teeth \u2014 an \u201cextreme risk protection order.\u201d Akin to a restraining order for domestic violence victims, the protection order, which predates Sandy Hook, gives the police the power to temporarily take away an individual\u2019s guns if a person makes threats, acts violently, abuses drugs or commits animal cruelty.\n\nIn the Florida massacre, the authorities believe that the gunman may have made threatening comments on social media, including one last September \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m going to be a professional school shooter\u201d \u2014 and had also posted a photo of a bloodied frog.\n\nA study that examined Connecticut\u2019s risk protection order found that, from 1999 to 2013, 99 percent of warrants led to the confiscation of at least one gun. In nearly half the cases, the gun owner wound up receiving psychiatric treatment.\n\nMike Lawlor, the criminal justice adviser to Governor Malloy, said that the law arose from two high-profile shootings in the 1990s by people with severe mental health issues. \u201cWhen there\u2019s no law that\u2019s actually been broken, but when there is real evidence that the person is a danger to others, the police need to have an option,\u201d he said. \u201cStep one is to get the guns.\u201d", "keywords": ["sandy", "hook", "control", "advocates", "magazines", "look", "law", "york", "massacre", "state", "laws", "florida", "gun", "connecticut", "wake", "guns"], "polarity": -0.025332773802161566, "subjectivity": 0.4034589701681538},

Evenly lit, crisply photographed, they look like pictures from an illustrated medical dictionary, indexical images of heads, torsos and mouths that are detached from context. Even in a work like \u201cFigure\u201d (1991), the figure in question, sheathed in a black dress and set in the black infinity of no particular place, feels like a fragment, as though she had been extracted from a group photo or a furnished room. The texts accompanying her, eight engraved plastic plaques, read like excerpts from a language primer: \u201cfigured the worst,\u201d \u201che was disfigured,\u201d \u201cfigured there would be no reaction\u201d and so on. Here, not only has the story been winnowed down; it is in fact completely gone. There\u2019s no story. We are left with only the tensions of concrete poetry.\n\nSometime in the mid-1990s, Simpson began to detect clich\u00e9d responses to her work. At the same time, her own thinking was evolving. What does an image of a black woman mean? A commentary on race? An assertion about gender? Simpson branched out from figure-based images and began to experiment more with varied subject matter \u2014 landscapes and inanimate objects like wigs \u2014 and also with unusual quasi-sculptural material like felt and standing screens. A series of monumental multisectional images, several of them landscapes, collectively titled \u201cPublic Sex\u201d (1995-1998) and featuring no figures at all, addressed the provocative title only obliquely. These pictures, made over many years, contain what the scholar and curator Okwui Enwezor calls \u201cthe rumor of the body.\u201d Mysteries of a jagged and deadpan sort, they would go on to influence the noirish tone of Simpson\u2019s later film work.\n\nPhoto\n\nSimpson began to set ever more intricate conceptual layers between her initial inspiration for a work and the finished product. The idea for \u201c9 Props\u201d (1995) began during a residency at the Pilchuck Glass School in Washington. With the aid of artisans at the school, she fabricated a series of dark vessels modeled on vases and other objects used in the portrait work of the pioneering Harlem photographer James Van Der Zee. But these vessels were not the final work. She shipped them back to New York and then photographed them against a plain background. And that still was not the work. Further intervention followed: She turned those photographic images into nine lithographs, which she printed on felt. Finally, she wrote captions below each lithographed vessel, describing the context in which it originally appeared. One of them, for instance, reads:\n\nDinner Party with boxer Harry Wills, 1926 James VanDerZee Harry Wills a k a \u201cThe Black Panther,\u201d boxer, businessman- sits with seven other men and women, mostly women with champagne glasses raised as a woman on his left makes a toast in his honor. There are three bottles of champagne, a crystal decanter, a bottle of port, an arrangement of flowers and fruit, and before each guest an untouched china place setting.\n\nPhoto\n\nFrom multiple directions, the work gestures at what cannot be seen: the original placement of the vessels that inspired Simpson\u2019s own, the people in the photographs by James Van Der Zee, the social life of Harlem evoked by his photographs and the complexity of manners and class implied by them. All that vanished world of culture and experience is reduced to an elegant grid, as simple as an antiquarian\u2019s catalog, a thought picture that demands calm engagement and imaginative intervention on the viewer\u2019s part. Without being representational, it is about race; but race is not off in some category by itself, hemmed in only by questions of skin color, separate from life.\n\n\u201cRepresent!\u201d in the black American sense means standing up for your people, expressing solidarity and letting a shared ethos underwrite your presence and work. It is an exhortation, a greeting and a farewell. The word also has more conventional associations. In the visual arts, it is contrasted with the abstract or the symbolic. To represent, in this more common sense, is to make work that visually corresponds to realities out there in the world: to illustrate uncomplicatedly. This second sense of \u201crepresent\u201d is enjoying a vogue in the art world. Realism is back. This is welcome: after so long an absence of black figures and black faces in art museums, they are now being seen more frequently. Many artists, black and otherwise, are depicting the black body. It is necessary and often successful. Just as often, it fails when it is little more than a clumsy shorthand for socially concerned art, unobjectionable and unimpressive.\n\nA strong appeal of Simpson\u2019s work is that she has always embraced the inherent complexity of blackness, her own blackness as well as the blackness that runs ineluctably through American history. She does not reject representational depictions, but neither does she feel the need to confine herself only to \u201crace\u201d work. When an artist uses a black model, she is presenting a human question by foregrounding a human presence. Is a white man a person while a black woman is and can only be a gendered and racialized subject? As the scholar Kellie Jones has pointed out, nonwhite bodies are often thought of as \u201cnot neutral enough for the dispassionate formulas thought to constitute conceptual practice.\u201d If a black woman\u2019s race and gender are the only things apparent to certain viewers, Simpson seems to say, the ethical responsibility to escape those shackles is the viewer\u2019s.\n\nFreedom is Lorna Simpson\u2019s starting point and her permanent theme. A humane current animates all of her work, a current that neither sidesteps nor confines itself to race. Her work is simultaneously about the \u201cneutral\u201d space of ideas and the particularized experience of the body. \u201cMontage\u201d is photographic and painterly, a riff on a pair of found photographs, sequenced to look like a giant strip of film. It deals with dreams and nightmares, ambiguities and vulnerabilities. At its heart is what Simpson calls \u201cthe push and pull of photography\u201d: the stuttering potential inherent in mechanical reproduction and the imperfect registrations that mirror subconscious life. It is a rapid response to the current political climate, situating a crucial part of it in the most intimate space of all, where the hectoring \u201cthey\u201d is temporarily held at bay in favor of the puzzled \u201cI.\u201d In your own sleeping bed, images persist and words are hard to come by.

He looks weak, not only in Moscow but throughout the world.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s silence has not necessarily stopped lower levels of his administration from responding to Russian actions, sometimes going further than Mr. Obama, who was also criticized for not doing enough to counter Moscow\u2019s threat. The Trump administration has decided to send weapons to Ukraine so it can defend itself against Russian intervention, and recently imposed sanctions on more human rights violators. After Russia ordered the American Embassy in Moscow to shed most of its staff, the administration responded by ordering Russia to close its consulate in San Francisco and diplomatic annexes in New York and Washington.\n\nLikewise, in just the past few days, the Trump administration formally blamed Russia for an expansive cyberattack last year called NotPetya and threatened unspecified \u201cinternational consequences.\u201d The nation\u2019s intelligence agency directors, including those appointed by Mr. Trump, unanimously warned in congressional testimony that Russia was already meddling in this year\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s own aides readily acknowledge the reality that he does not. Besides describing Russian interference as undeniable on Saturday, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, his national security adviser, speaking at the Munich Security Conference, said Mr. Mueller\u2019s charges made clear that Russia had been engaged in a \u201csophisticated form of espionage\u201d against the United States.\n\n\u201cWith the F.B.I. indictment, the evidence is now really incontrovertible and available in the public domain,\u201d he said.\n\nLate Saturday night, however, Mr. Trump, contradicted General McMaster, writing on Twitter shortly before midnight that his aide \u201cforgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia\u201d and the Democrats.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a second late-night tweet, Mr. Trump said that the F.B.I. missed warning signs of the gunman who killed 17 people at a Florida school on Wednesday because it was too focused on the Russia investigation. \u201cVery sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is not acceptable.

When his Justice Department indicted the 13 Russians and three Russian entities on Friday for trying to \u201csow discord in the U.S. political system,\u201d the president focused on the fact that no evidence was presented that he or his campaign was knowingly involved.\n\nIndeed, the indictment made no assertion that the president or anyone affiliated with him did anything wrong, understandably a relief for Mr. Trump, given a year of investigation and media reports exploring the possibility of collaboration with Russia. The \u201cinformation warfare against the United States,\u201d as one Russian organization called it, started as early as 2014, predating Mr. Trump\u2019s entry into the race.\n\nBut the indictment also determined that by 2016 the effort had evolved into a deliberate attempt to support Mr. Trump and disparage Mrs. Clinton. And the charges against the Russians are not the end of the investigation by Mr. Mueller, nor do they mean that there were no contacts or cooperation that may eventually spell legal trouble for people in the president\u2019s orbit.\n\nPrevious legal filings and news accounts have documented multiple contacts between Mr. Trump\u2019s team and Russians in 2016. Among them was a June 2016 meeting hosted by Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s son, Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, and Paul J. Manafort, his campaign chairman, on the promise that Russian visitors would provide incriminating information about Mrs. Clinton as part of the Russian government\u2019s support of the elder Mr. Trump.\n\nThe findings included in Friday\u2019s indictment bolstered the conclusions of American intelligence agencies, which for more than a year have said that Russia interfered in the election, a determination that Mr. Trump has occasionally accepted but more often dismissed as a \u201choax.\u201d Only in a written statement that aides issued in his name after his tweet on Friday was any concern expressed about the Russian attack described in the indictment, and then only to urge his critics to stop questioning him.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cWe cannot allow those seeking to sow confusion, discord and rancor to be successful,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt\u2019s time we stop the outlandish partisan attacks, wild and false allegations, and far-fetched theories, which only serve to further the agendas of bad actors, like Russia, and do nothing to protect the principles of our institutions. We must unite as Americans to protect the integrity of our democracy and our elections.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s position stood in contrast to that of fellow Republicans who responded to the indictment with calls for tougher action against Russia. To many, the president\u2019s reaction once again raised the question of why he would go easy on Moscow. He has spoken about Mr. Putin in generally flattering or friendly terms and avoided direct criticism even during moments of enormous stress in the relationship between the two countries.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor the moment, the government is left to act without the president. Jeh C. Johnson, a secretary of homeland security under Mr. Obama, said the best way to stop Russia from interfering in the future is the threat of a powerful response. \u201cWhen it comes to cyberattacks, it will always be easier to be on offense than defense,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when it comes to cyberattacks between nation-states, the most effective defense is to simply make the offensive behavior cost-prohibitive.\u201d\n\nBut the best way to do that, experts said, is for the president to lead the way. \u201cThe U.S. government cannot mobilize an effective strategy without White House leadership and prioritization,\u201d said Heather A. Conley, a State Department official under President George W. Bush who testified at a Senate hearing in the past week on defending against Russian interference.\n\nDespite the warnings by the intelligence chiefs and the threat detailed in the indictment, she said, \u201cthere continues to be no policy message or response, leaving our country unprotected and vulnerable.\u201d\n\nJohn P. Carlin, a former assistant attorney general for national security and chief of staff to Mr. Mueller when he was F.B.I. director, said the president\u2019s silence sent a message to Russia and the world.\n\n\u201cI think it does have consequences,\u201d he said. The American government can warn against further interference, but \u201cit would be better if it gets driven by the commander in chief. The goal is to drive a clear message that says the United States and our allies throughout the world that share our values are drawing a line that says \u2018stop, this is unacceptable.\u2019\u201d", "keywords": ["trumps", "leaves", "mr", "trump", "presidents", "russia", "2016", "silence", "conspicuous", "way", "leader", "indictment", "russian", "president", "struggle"], "polarity": 0.0938321802807784, "subjectivity": 0.3940916171056356},

To some extent, there\u2019s always been an adversarial role between the White House and reporters. How do you feel about the tenor of things now? It used to be friendly-adversarial. There would be retaliation for stories they didn\u2019t like, but nothing compared with this. There\u2019s a war going on. For a president to come out with the term \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 he\u2019s putting targets on our heads. He has moved the goal posts when it comes to how politicians and people deal with the press.\n\nWhat\u2019s the value of the White House press briefing? Transparency. There is a veil on the White House; people want to look behind the curtain. It\u2019s their house. When you open up a press briefing to see the back and forth, you\u2019re getting more in the weeds of what\u2019s going on, beyond just the quote we may put in the story. This is a key piece that I don\u2019t think people really get: When you talk about the press, it\u2019s not about journalists; it\u2019s about the free-flowing information that the American public is supposed to get. When you bash the press, you\u2019re bashing the idea of getting truth out.\n\nWhat\u2019s the public opinion of the White House press corps? It depends on whom you talk to. We\u2019re so tribal now. There used to be a day when you didn\u2019t know the person\u2019s politics. The line has been obscured between facts and opinion. I think it started during the Clinton years, and it just kept getting progressively worse. People don\u2019t want to just hear the news; they want to hear what people have to say about it too.\n\nYour reactions during the televised briefings have generated memes. Has it made you more self-conscious? I\u2019m so sad about that. My boss has always said, \u201cYou need to know how to play poker.\u201d I don\u2019t. I\u2019m trying! The last time I was really caught off guard was when Sarah Huckabee Sanders said something about people\u2019s minds being in the gutter after President Trump\u2019s tweet about Kirsten Gillibrand. I really get into those briefings. I really try to listen. I don\u2019t play to the camera. I go in there, and I\u2019m really earnest. So when she said that, I was shocked! I was like, No, God, that was a little bit much.\n\nGiven how much you tangle with this particular administration, why do you think you get called on so much? Have you felt like a target? Yes, I have. But I have to shake that off, because I have to go in and do my job. I cover the White House. I cover all issues, particularly those that affect black and brown Americans. Now, what if they didn\u2019t call on me? A certain segment of America would not get the answers to some of their pressing questions. If I don\u2019t ask, who will?\n\nRyan is the White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks and a political analyst for CNN.

You had to ask whether this president believed slavery was wrong. I recently asked him, \u201cAre you a racist?\u201d It\u2019s a sad day when you have to ask a sitting president that. There has been a series of comments or lack of action, from calling Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas\u201d to how he dealt with Charlottesville to his comments on Norway versus Haiti, Africa, El Salvador, black and brown nations. It\u2019s not been one thing. It\u2019s been a pattern. So I asked. He did not answer, which I thought was a wasted moment. He could have put it to rest right then and there and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a racist.\u201d But it took him days to say that.\n\nYou said it seems as if it has changed, going forward, how the White House deals with the press corps and wields its power. What do you think this means for the next president you cover? He\u2019ll clamp down harder on us. Each president has pushed us further away from access. Who knows what will happen or what another president may want? They may not want to be followed. President Obama didn\u2019t like being followed, for example. This president hates us. He\u2019s warring on us.

Just like our kid who\u2019s not white dresses up like Captain America. I think the beautiful thing about comics is they do transcend race in a lot of ways.\u201d\n\nMary Dimacali, 29, a social media and marketing manager in Rockland County, New York, echoed that idea. She does not believe that her fianc\u00e9\u2019s 7-year-old son, Sawyer, who is white, sees the film or its characters through the lens of race. Sawyer himself, during the interview with Ms. Dimacali, said, \u201csure,\u201d when she asked if he\u2019d like to dress up as Black Panther.\n\n\u201cFor a white kid to be so open and judge based on the character\u2019s story and the personality and history, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s important,\u201d she said. \u201cBut on the flip side, I think it\u2019s also great to have a black superhero you can identify and connect to.\u201d\n\nThe character\u2019s history is unique. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1966, Black Panther rules as the king of an African technological utopia known as Wakanda. Untouched by European invaders, Wakanda exists apart from the legacies of colonization and racism. Black history and black fantasy are central to the character, and the series has brought on prominent black writers including Ta-Nehisi Coates to deepen its significance over the last 50 years.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

He is completing \u201cRise of the Black Panther,\u201d a six-part comic series for Marvel that traces the character\u2019s early history. He has tried to explain some of that history to his 7-year-old daughter, but without delving too deeply into complex concepts like Western imperialism, which she may struggle to grasp.\n\n\u201cYou want that white kid to be able to think that he can dress up in a Black Panther costume, because, to that kid, there\u2019s no difference between Captain America and Black Panther,\u201d Mr. Narcisse, 45, said. But, he added, it also involves \u201ctrying to explain what is special about T\u2019Challa and Wakanda without racism.

It\u2019s projected to make a record-breaking $165 million over Presidents\u2019 Day weekend and comparisons to last year\u2019s \u201cWonder Woman\u201d bode well for its reception and impact, particularly for black people.\n\n\u201cWhite people have the privilege of not constantly being reminded of their race in the United States, where white is the majority, whereas as a black person you don\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Vittrup said. She believes that parents in general, and white parents in particular, are reluctant to talk about race with young children. When they do, they often miss the chance to talk about inequality, even though research supports the idea that children develop an awareness of race and difference at a very young age.\n\nMs. Vittrup was careful to add that dressing as Black Panther isn\u2019t inherently appropriative or offensive. The character comes from an invented African country, and to wear his mask isn\u2019t quite the same as wearing blackface. However, in a moment where even more black heroes, like Luke Cage and Black Lightning, are finding their way into the limelight, Black Panther\u2019s relationship with the black community and its history creates an opportunity to teach nonblack children about the black experience.\n\n\u201cKids are not colorblind,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of structural inequality in our society, and kids are noticing that.

Even the clothes are an 18th-century version of current POTUS style: basic black suit and fat tie. As for Washington, he stands blank-faced, one arm extended, like a tenor taking a dignified bow.\n\n[Read remarks from the Obamas and the artists. ]\n\nUninflected dignity was the attitude of choice for well over a century, with a few breaks. In an 1836 portrait, Andrew Jackson, a demonstrative bully, sports a floor-length, red-silk-lined Dracula cloak and a kind of topiary bouffant. (A picture of Jackson, one of President Trump\u2019s populist heroes, hangs in the Oval Office.) Abraham Lincoln, seen in several likenesses, is exceptional for looking as if he may actually have weighty matters on his mind. Most of the portraits that precede and follow his are pure P.R.\n\nThis continues well into the 20th century. In a 1980 painting Jimmy Carter trades a black suit for a beige one. How revolutionary is that? And there\u2019s a Casual Fridays vogue: Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both go tieless for it. Under the circumstances, Elaine de Kooning\u2019s 1963 portrait of John F. Kennedy, a fanfare of green and blue strokes, hits like a boost of adrenaline. Rousing too, though not in a good way, is a big head shot image of Bill Clinton by the artist Chuck Close. Using his signature mosaic-like painting technique, Mr. Close turns the 42nd president into a pixelated clown.\n\nMr. Obama has much better luck with his similarly high-profile portraitist. Mr. Wiley, born in Los Angeles in 1977, gained a following in the early 2000s with his crisp, glossy, life-size paintings of young African-American men dressed in hip-hop styles, but depicted in the old-master manner of European royal portraits. More recently he has expanded his repertoire to include female subjects, as well as models from Brazil, India, Nigeria and Senegal, creating the collective image of a global black aristocracy.\n\nIn an imposingly scaled painting \u2014 just over seven feet tall \u2014 the artist presents Mr. Obama dressed in the regulation black suit and an open-necked white shirt, and seated on a vaguely thronelike chair not so different from the one seen in Stuart\u2019s Washington portrait. But art historical references stop there. So do tonal echoes of past portraits. Whereas Mr. Obama\u2019s predecessors are, to the man, shown expressionless and composed, Mr. Obama sits tensely forward, frowning, elbows on his knees, arms crossed, as if listening hard. No smiles, no Mr. Nice Guy. He\u2019s still troubleshooting, still in the game.\n\nVideo\n\nHis engaged and assertive demeanor contradicts \u2014 and cosmetically corrects \u2014 the impression he often made in office of being philosophically detached from what was going on around him. At some level, all portraits are propaganda, political or personal. And what makes this one distinctive is the personal part. Mr. Wiley has set Mr. Obama against \u2014 really embedded him in \u2014 a bower of what looks like ground cover. From the greenery sprout flowers that have symbolic meaning for the sitter. African blue lilies represent Kenya, his father\u2019s birthplace; jasmine stands for Hawaii, where Mr. Obama himself was born; chrysanthemums, the official flower of Chicago, reference the city where his political career began, and where he met his wife.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMrs. Obama\u2019s choice of Ms. Sherald as an artist was an enterprising one. Ms. Sherald, who was born in Columbus, Ga., in 1973 and lives in Baltimore, is just beginning to move into the national spotlight after putting her career on hold for some years to deal with a family health crisis, and one of her own. (She had a heart transplant at 39.) Production-wise, she and Mr. Wiley operate quite differently. He runs the equivalent of a multinational art factory, with assistants churning out work. Ms. Sherald, who until a few years ago made her living waiting tables, oversees a studio staff of one, herself.\n\nAt the same time, they have much in common. Both focused early on African-American portraiture precisely because it is so little represented in Western art history. And both tend to blend fact and fiction. Mr. Wiley, with photo-realistic precision, casts actual people in fantastically heroic roles. (He modifies his heroizing in the case of Mr. Obama, but it\u2019s still there.) Ms. Sherald also starts with realism, but softens and abstracts it. She gives all her figures gray-toned skin \u2014 a color with ambiguous racial associations \u2014 and reduces bodies to geometric forms silhouetted against single-color fields.\n\nShe shows Mrs. Obama sitting against a field of light blue, wearing a spreading gown. The dress design, by Michelle Smith, is eye-teasingly complicated: mostly white interrupted by black Op Art-ish blips and patches of striped color suggestive of African textiles. The shape of the dress, rising pyramidally upward, mountain-like, feels as if it were the real subject of the portrait. Mrs. Obama\u2019s face forms the composition\u2019s peak, but could be almost anyone\u2019s face, like a model\u2019s face in a fashion spread. To be honest, I was anticipating \u2014 hoping for \u2014 a bolder, more incisive image of the strong-voiced person I imagine this former first lady to be.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m wishing, let me mention something more. Mr. Obama\u2019s portrait will be installed, long-term, among those of his presidential peers, in a dedicated space on the second floor. Mrs. Obama\u2019s will hang in a corridor reserved for temporary displays of new acquisitions \u2014 on the first floor. It will stay there until November, after which there\u2019s no set-aside place for it to land.\n\nIf first men have an acknowledged showcase, first women \u2014 ladies or not \u2014 should too. Better, they should all be together, sharing space, offering a welcoming environment to, among others, a future first female president, and creating a lasting monument to #MeToo.", "keywords": ["portrait", "fact", "mr", "black", "ms", "paint", "portraits", "blend", "sherald", "fiction", "washington", "wiley", "politics", "obama", "obamas"], "polarity": 0.07208600786186993, "subjectivity": 0.35921572042261696},

While it is true that compared with Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton lost ground with that segment of the electorate, the clues to a new Democratic majority may be found in the coalition that elected Mr. Northam governor of Virginia, or perhaps more accurately, voted against Mr. Gillespie and his immigrant bashing.\n\nIn Virginia, polling data has made it clear that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 rhetoric backfired among minority voters as well as, crucially, among many whites. Mr. Northam won a majority of white college-educated voters, who made up a larger share of the electorate in 2017 than they did in 2016. Mr. Gillespie matched Mr. Trump with noncollege whites, but their turnout was down. And minority voters in 2017 matched their 2016 electorate share \u2014 for the first time ever there was no drop-off from the presidential to the gubernatorial election. The Democrats also expanded their margin of victory in Virginia from five percentage points in 2016 to nine points in 2017.\n\nBefore the vote in Virginia, pundits on both the right and left were speculating that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s anti-immigrant strategy was working. But in the end, election results and polling data in Virginia proved all that thinking was wrong. While each state has its own demographics and distinct politics, Virginia has voters who span demographic and economic spectrums. Majorities of voters of all races and ethnicities rejected anti-immigrant stereotypes as ugly and wrong.\n\nAccording to an election eve survey of voters by Latino Decisions, Latino voters said that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads made them less enthusiastic about him, by a 45-point margin. But it wasn\u2019t just Latino voters. By a 23-point margin (52 to 29), whites in Virginia also said the MS-13 ads turned them away from Mr. Gillespie, as did African-American and Asian-American voters by larger margins.\n\nData speaks louder than punditry, and our regression analysis of survey data paints a clear picture. Exposure to Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads actually helped drive white college-educated voters away from the Republicans. When we analyzed findings for white independents and Republicans, voters who were aware of the MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Mr. Gillespie\u2019s Democratic opponent. What should be alarming for Republicans is that this effect wasn\u2019t limited to the governor\u2019s race. The Gillespie campaign had coattail effects, but of the wrong stripe. Across all racial groups, those who were aware of Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Democratic candidates for Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates.\n\nThis means that not only is it morally just for Democrats to position themselves as the party that stands against hatred and bigotry and in favor of inclusiveness and opportunity, but it is also a strategically sound position for winning votes. Simultaneously, it sends a clear, welcoming message to Latino, African-American and Asian-American voters, while also winning over enough of the white voters who also oppose immigrant bashing.\n\nThis phenomenon is particularly true of voters who will decide crucial House and Senate races in 2018: people of color and white college-educated voters \u2014 also known as the Democratic base. Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans are clearly gearing up for a similar anti-immigrant effort in 2018. But now the mask has been pulled off. Voters get it. Democrats have an opportunity to speak out strongly against bigotry. And in doing so, they have a path to victory in 2018 and beyond.", "keywords": ["ads", "virginia", "democrats", "mr", "ms13", "vote", "republicans", "voters", "win", "white", "immigration", "gillespies"], "polarity": 0.10965551203646441, "subjectivity": 0.4705427288760622},

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nYet, despite the obvious truth of that statement, we may wonder: What are the moral and political arguments that underwrite the claim that black lives matter? While there is no way to articulate the full scope of those arguments in a single essay, it\u2019s worth considering the philosophical contributions of some of the forerunners of the movement that is our most urgent manifestation of black thought today.\n\nThe end of the Civil War and the subsequent ratification of the 13th Amendment in 1865 legally abolished slavery, but blacks quickly became subject to a displaced form of violence at the hands of white supremacists across the nation who typically used false accusations of sexual assault to justify lynching black men. Police turned a blind eye to these murders, and sometimes actively facilitated them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIda B. Wells, a leading black thinker and journalist in the late-19th and early 20th centuries, and a co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, built a public career documenting lynchings and calling America to account for them. Her arguments extended and amplified those made by Frederick Douglass before her. Douglass\u2019s central claim in his seminal \u201cThe Meaning of July Fourth for the Negro\u201d was that Americans should feel shame for slavery, given their country\u2019s foundational commitment to liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We were failing our own ideals.\n\nWells pointed to the rise of lynching after the fall of slavery as not merely a legal matter to be rectified with new laws. Having fled her hometown to escape threats of her own lynching, Wells used the press to make her moral arguments. She described a nation in the grip of a dark remorse for freeing black Americans from slavery, and condemned white Americans for cruelties that violated their own commitment to the democratic project.\n\nThe horrors that Wells described were a factor in the Great Migration of blacks to the North, which fed the flourishing of black thought and cultural life that gave rise to the Harlem Renaissance. An indication that the Harlem Renaissance was always meant to be a period of radical black philosophy and social change was the name originally coined for the movement: The New Negro. Alain Locke, the Harvard-educated black intellectual who became known as the father of the Harlem Renaissance, envisioned a philosophical position that reinvigorated blacks\u2019 relationship to their culture and that would in turn solidify their status as equal co-participants in our democracy.\n\nA strong theme among some of the luminaries of the time focused on the will of blacks to assert their humanity against racism and to insist on their status as persons owed respect. Among those stars, the poet Langston Hughes was one of the brightest. His \u201cI Too\u201d is a quiet yet insistent poem depicting a black man employed by a white one and his struggle with invisibility. The protagonist resolves to sit at the table with the white folks the next day and show people how beautiful he is and that he, too, is America. The writer Zora Neale Hurston had an equally persistent but at times more playful take on the matter. In her essay \u201cHow It Feels to Be Colored Me,\u201d she wrote, \u201cSometimes, I feel discriminated against, but it does not make me angry. It merely astonishes me. How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company! It\u2019s beyond me.\u201d\n\nThinkers like Hughes and Hurston were involved in the Harlem Renaissance project of presenting a vision of black cultural vitality and worth that would rework the image of black Americans that whites typically relied upon. That stream of thought runs directly into the heart of Black Lives Matter.\n\nAnother valuable and necessary development to come out of the Black Lives Matter movement is the de-emphasizing of black patriarchy and the equal acknowledgment of the suffering of black women and the black L.G.T.B.Q. community. Though sexuality was an avenue of inquiry during the Harlem Renaissance, it was perhaps the mid- to late-20th century poet and theorist Audre Lorde who did the most to make black women\u2019s sexuality a focal point of political and social philosophy.\n\nWhile today \u201cintersectionality\u201d is bandied about as the cutting edge of social research, it was Lorde who in her writing insisted on complicating our view of personal identity by claiming that each of us belongs to multiple identity communities, all of which contribute to our sense of self and our purposes.\n\nShe also showed the broad reach of white supremacy and its effects on black Americans as they located themselves in more nuanced ways in the tapestry of American culture. For her, the primary form taken by resistance to racism was the denial of blunt categories imposed on black Americans, which stifled the possibility of an individual\u2019s full flourishing. Lorde, then, called for a radical form of self-possession whose boundaries were not open to negotiation with a white society.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen people think of Black Lives Matter, they often think of anger feeding forceful protests. Anger is a reasonable response to racial injustice. To be certain, groups like the Black Panthers and thinkers like Malcolm X advised black Americans to get angry and take the doctrine of armed self-defense seriously. Though anger and love are not mutually exclusive emotions, James Baldwin and Martin Luther King Jr. affirmed a view of civic love to pre-empt the need for violence.\n\nKing espoused a form of Kantian regard that prioritized conceiving of every human, racist or not, as owed a kind of love that is grounded in the ideal of universal respect. Baldwin held a slightly different view. He felt black Americans ought to see whites as democratic kin or family, as people with whom blacks would have serious quarrels but also people whom it would be worth keeping close in order to strengthen and bring integrity to the bonds of shared democratic life. These two views of love eschewed violence yet insisted on militancy. While forgiveness and acceptance were hallmarks of King\u2019s and Baldwin\u2019s views, so was an unyielding commitment to self-respect and the demand for social change to institutionalize the idea that blacks were co-creators of the American kingdom.\n\nThinkers like Wells, Hughes, Hurston, Lorde and Baldwin not only anticipated the current Black Lives Matter movement but provided an intellectual blueprint to give depth and integrity to that slogan, so that its meaning transcends the demand to stop police brutality. It is a demand for whites to extend their historical imagination and recognize that the ills of racism are not the result of a few bad police officers or a few out-and-out racists in some far-off corner of America. The problem, rather, is a kind of complicity \u2014 one partaking in the false comfort that America has somehow escaped the trajectory of its racially murderous history. It is necessary that we to see our society today as continuous with that history and not anomalous to it.\n\nBlack thought\u2019s primary contribution to the academy and to American society is the richness and precision with which it describes our worst demons to us, while offering a vision of how we might each save our democracy from the ruin of irrational fear and hatred.", "keywords": ["americans", "lives", "movement", "black", "blacks", "renaissance", "matter", "showed", "white", "harlem", "america"], "polarity": 0.043612258953168, "subjectivity": 0.3973699190419967},

Bell Pottinger may have set back race relations in South Africa by as much as 10 years.\u201d\n\nWithin days of the firm\u2019s removal from the trade association, clients were fleeing. By the end of September, all 250 employees were laid off and Bell Pottinger was finished.\n\nA Unique Client List\n\nLondon is now home to a cluster of P.R. firms catering to foreign governments, raising worries that the city has become \u201cthe global capital of reputation laundering,\u201d as The Evening Standard put it a few years ago.

When the pair started working together in the mid-80s, Mr. Bell was sought after by political leaders and corporations who wanted some of the communications magic he had provided to Mrs. Thatcher.\n\nBell Pottinger quickly had hundreds of clients, a few of them infamous. Mr. Bell attributes his ability to work with virtually anyone to innate optimism.\n\n\u201cI see the good in people,\u201d he said.\n\nThis included Chile\u2019s former dictator Augusto Pinochet. Mr. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain in 1998 as part of an effort to deport him to Spain, where he had been indicted on a charge of torturing Spanish citizens.\n\nAfter two years of legal and political wrangling, Mr. Bell and his allies prevailed when Mr. Pinochet was authorized to freely return to Chile.\n\nBell Pottinger was hardly the only British outfit working for rogues and despots, as well as publicly traded companies, nor was it the largest or most profitable. But it had a buccaneering spirit that made it the firm of choice for a wide variety of missions.\n\n\n\nDuring the war in Iraq, Bell Pottinger had a contract with the Pentagon to produce propaganda for the United States military. This included scripts in Arabic for a soap opera that aired in the country, said Mr. Bell.\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen the company\u2019s client list did not generate news, its methods did. In 2011, it was caught boasting about its skills in the dark arts of search engine manipulation to people it thought were potential clients.\n\nIn fact, they were undercover members of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit organization that works with a variety of media.

Mr. Bell, who had worked in South Africa for years, said he had no idea what the brothers wanted, but he and several colleagues flew to Johannesburg to find out.\n\n\u201cWe went to this bloody great mansion, which seemed to be their headquarters,\u201d Mr. Bell recalled. \u201cGreat big room, huge sofas all over the place. Servants. Appalling, all of it.\u201d\n\nThe family already had a fortune, Tony Gupta told the small entourage. Now, he and his brothers wanted to help poor blacks. To that end, they wanted a P.R. campaign that pushed the idea of economic emancipation.\n\n\u201cSo we went back to London and wrote a strategy,\u201d said Mr. Bell. \u201cTown hall meetings, marching in the street, that kind of thing. Draw attention to the economic imbalance, then tell people they should protest and demand change.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe company drafted a two-page proposal, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times. Among its recommendations was \u201ca non-party political narrative around the existence of economic apartheid\u201d that Bell Pottinger would package \u201cinto speeches, news releases, website content, videos/broadcast content, slogans and other material required.\u201d\n\nSoon, the Guptas said that their company needed communications help, too. Most South Africans, the Guptas maintained, had an inflated notion of how much of the family\u2019s revenue came from government contracts, which harmed their interests, several Bell Pottinger employees recalled.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe corporate campaign was the first sign that altruism had little to do with the \u00a3100,000 a month that Bell Pottinger would earn during what was initially a three-month project. The second was the anger of the company\u2019s other South Africa clients when they learned of the arrangement.\n\nThe billionaire Johann Rupert was aghast to suddenly find himself one of the most prominent examples of \u201cwhite monopoly capital.\u201d He texted Mr. Bell and asked how his P.R. firm could also be working for a family that was bashing him. Mr. Bell, by his own account, quickly lost enthusiasm for the Gupta project.\n\n\u201cIt was altogether smelly,\u201d he said of the racial element of the work. But he quickly added that ethics were not the issue. If enough South African clients quit Bell Pottinger, he reasoned, the losses would outweigh the Guptas\u2019s checks. \u201cI was saying it\u2019s not a commercially sensible thing to do.\u201d\n\nBut by the end of March, only one client \u2014 the banking and asset management company Investec \u2014 had severed ties with the P.R. firm. After that, Bell Pottinger tried to find middle ground by signing a new contract with the Guptas, this time with a codicil literally called an anti-embarrassment clause. It allowed the firm to terminate the account \u201cwithout notice\u201d if the brothers brought discredit to the business.\n\nMr. Bell said he soon resolved to quit the company because he felt undermined and undervalued by Mr. Henderson. \u201cHe made my life a misery from start to finish,\u201d said Mr. Bell, speaking one recent afternoon in the living room of his home near London\u2019s Sloane Square. After negotiating a \u00a33.5 million exit package, Mr. Bell resigned in August 2016.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor his part, Mr. Henderson declined in a recent interview to indulge in the put-downs that come so easily to his antagonist. Seated at a conference table in temporary offices in Mayfair, where he is starting a new P.R. firm, he said Bell Pottinger\u2019s dissolution was too recent to discuss.\n\n\u201cI have huge empathy for all those impacted,\u201d he said, \u201cand believe now is not the appropriate time to go into details.\u201d\n\nInflaming Tensions\n\nThe P.R. campaign in South Africa, which started in 2016, was intended to raise the temperature of race relations. And it worked.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore than 100 fake Twitter accounts were created, all of them retweeting content from other Twitter accounts with names like @economycapture, according to media reports. Popular hashtags included #WhiteMonopolyCapital and #RespectGuptas. The campaign involved some 220,000 tweets.\n\nThere were also attack website with names like WMC Leaks and WMC Scams. Another part of this ecosystem were mainstream media outlets owned by the Guptas, like ANN7, a 24-hour news channel, and The New Age, a daily newspaper.\n\nAs the campaign spread, leaders at groups like the A.N.C. Youth League gave inflammatory speeches, decrying the \u201cstranglehold\u201d that rich whites had on the economy. Leaked emails would later show that the groups received media training, and in some cases funds, from Oakbay.\n\nAn atmosphere of menace slowly pervaded the country. In July 2016, the police minister announced the creation of a task force to investigate the murder of more than a dozen political figures. In the run-up to municipal elections that year, Mr. Zuma described the Democratic Alliance, the A.N.C.\u2019s main rival, as a \u201cwhite party,\u201d adding that it could not \u201crun this country no matter how they cover up by getting a few black stooges.\u201d\n\nNew and radical groups like Black First Land First sprang up, holding public rallies to fulminate against whites. At one, in May 2016, a pastor named Xola Skosana told the crowd, \u201cWe have been wounded beyond measure. Let us find the pillars and bring the house down. Black people must be avenged.\u201d\n\nFor the first time in years, whites felt a rising sense of personal danger. Nicholas Wolpe, a white South African whose father was a pioneer of the anti-apartheid movement, remembers a palpable anxiety. \u201cThere was a shift toward intolerance,\u201d he said. \u201cGradually, the debate about white monopoly capital was everywhere and the people talking about it were loud and belligerent. It struck a nerve.\u201d\n\nIn a related and surreptitious campaign, the Guptas were being recast as warmhearted people eager to help the downtrodden. A website connected to Black First Land First ran editorials defending the brothers, suggesting in one that they should be \u201cpraised for saving jobs.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["met", "campaign", "mr", "end", "reading", "main", "bell", "rogues", "pr", "company", "firm", "africa", "south", "pottinger", "guptas", "despots"], "polarity": 0.05728090899659527, "subjectivity": 0.3829289628309236},

Often, this work is done by women who are later overlooked; in the case of the civil rights struggle, for instance, women like Jo Ann Robinson and Georgia Gilmore fund-raised for and organized the Montgomery bus boycott. Their efforts, however, have often been eclipsed by stories emphasizing the rise of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

Just as Ms. Robinson and Ms. Gilmore led the 1955-56 boycott of buses in Alabama, in the 1970s, women like Louise Day Hicks led the antibusing crusades in the North, in an effort to avoid the desegregation of Boston public schools. While men debated in legislative chambers and listened to challenges on the bench, women headed to school cafeterias, playgrounds and PTA meetings, doing the bulk of the behind-the-scenes work of supporting the politics of segregation.\n\nWhite women organized precinct gatherings to pressure their politicians to uphold Jim Crow laws. They transformed their homes into centers of bureaucratic efficiency \u2014 copying fliers, assigning neighborhoods for petition drives and scheduling protest shifts at elementary schools and bus garages.\n\nIt was also women who shaped the way segregation, white supremacy and ideas about racial identity were knitted into the fabric of their communities. Working as midwives, teachers and social workers, women policed the racial identity of babies, students and clients to ensure that the dividing line between white and black remained intact. And across the nation, women-led groups like Patriotic American Youth and the Women for Constitutional Government and Pro America spread the message to the next generation that opposition to racial equality was about states\u2019 rights and limited government, not white supremacy.\n\nIf narratives about white supremacy have been shaped by the overwhelmingly masculine lens through which we examine practically all political movements, there are also aspects of white supremacy that make it different. One critical factor here is the central role ascribed to white male sexual and status anxiety and lust for dominance in fomenting organized white-supremacist activities. As part of arguments against desegregation, many who belonged to these movements embraced a narrative that saw white women and girls as vulnerable (to black men), and white men as protectors \u2014 a story line that simultaneously elevated white men and rendered women helpmates and beneficiaries, not activists.\n\nBut this broader narrative obscures and even gives cover to the ways white women sometimes used white supremacy for their own gain. The suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt in the early 20th century argued for women\u2019s voting rights in Southern states on the basis that \u201cwhite supremacy will be strengthened, not weakened, by white women\u2019s suffrage.\u201d In the 1920s, the journalist Nell Battle Lewis of North Carolina never questioned the absolute need for racial segregation even as she criticized the violence committed in the name of Jim Crow. Staying in the racial fold, she was afforded the opportunity to blast her state\u2019s regressive labor and gender politics. Being a white supremacist, even a liberal one, meant that she remained part of the conversation.\n\nThe point, here, is neither to catalog nor to celebrate white women\u2019s contributions to white supremacist politics. Instead, their work should change how we understand history. It is easy to denounce the racist pronouncements and white-supremacist politics of a George Wallace or a Roy Moore. But what white women teach us is that white-supremacist politics is sustained at a much more grass-roots level by our neighbors, school boards and even friends. White women have made white supremacy a much more formidable and long-lasting force in American society, sustaining it at both the local and national levels.\n\nToday, it seems, the story America prefers to tell itself about white supremacy has changed little since the middle of the century: Instead of Klan lynchings, we focus on the rally in Charlottesville; instead of George Wallace, we focus on Jeff Sessions or, for that matter, Donald Trump. Outrage over the violence and rhetoric of these men buries an equally important and certainly more intransigent story of longstanding grass-roots and national campaigns populated partly by white women who aim to maintain racial and economic inequities on the American landscape. If we begin to consider their staying power with seriousness rather than surprise \u2014 a surprise not shared by black women \u2014 perhaps we can more effectively prepare to counter this strand of American politics.", "keywords": ["whitesupremacist", "racial", "power", "work", "supremacy", "white", "politics", "american", "womens", "women", "men"], "polarity": 0.08455011423761423, "subjectivity": 0.23956078643578646},

A graduate of Nascar\u2019s Drive for Diversity program, Darrell Wallace Jr., 24, could give stock car racing something it has never had before: an African-American star.\n\nBut that is not why Richard Petty brought Wallace onto his team. Late last season, Wallace, who goes by the nickname Bubba, got four rides with Richard Petty Motorsports. It was enough for Petty, one of Nascar\u2019s most iconic names, to not only give Wallace a full-time ride, but also to give him his famed No. 43 racecar to drive. Wallace is the first African-American to drive full-time in the top Nascar series since Wendell Scott in 1971.\n\nPetty insisted, though, that he is colorblind when it comes to evaluating talent.

After graduating from Lanier High School, he went to Morehouse College, the historically black institution in Atlanta, and was working on the student newspaper when it published some of the early writings of another Morehouse student, Martin Luther King Jr. Mr. Bennett graduated in 1949, the year after King did, and went to work at the black newspaper Atlanta Daily World.\n\nHe moved to Jet magazine in Chicago in 1953 as an associate editor and to Ebony, its sister publication, a year later. He became senior editor there in 1958 and later executive editor. He worked for the magazine into his 80s.\n\n\u201cBefore the Mayflower\u201d established Mr. Bennett as a leading scholarly voice during the racial ferment of the 1960s. In 1966 he testified before a House Education subcommittee looking into racism and unrest, and was blunt, tracing the turmoil of the times to an education system that did not prepare students to live in a multiracial society.\n\n\u201cIt is my opinion, and the opinion of many writers and scholars in this field,\u201d he said, \u201cthat segregated textbooks \u2014 and segregated and segregating use of words, symbols and ideas \u2014 are as dangerous to the internal peace of America as segregated schools and residential areas.\u201d\n\nThat was relatively mild compared with what he said about Abraham Lincoln in a January 1968 article in Ebony. Despite his reputation as an emancipator, Mr. Bennett wrote, Lincoln was actually a white supremacist who thought that the races would be better off separated, \u201cpreferably with the Atlantic Ocean or some other large, deep body of water between them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe man\u2019s character, his way with words and his assassination, together with the psychological needs of a racist society, have obscured his contradictions under a mountain of myths,\u201d he added.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn an interview after the article was published, he stuck to his guns. \u201cLast year, during the riot season, President Johnson said he hoped he would handle himself as Lincoln did during the Civil War,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he does, it will be a disaster.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Bennett expanded on his argument in 2000 in the book \u201cForced Into Glory: Abraham Lincoln\u2019s White Dream.\u201d The historian James M. McPherson found it a flawed work.\n\n\u201cBennett,\u201d he wrote in reviewing the book in The New York Times, \u201cfails to appreciate the acuity and empathy that enabled Lincoln to transcend his prejudices and to preside over the greatest social revolution in American history.\u201d\n\nMr. Bennett\u2019s other books included \u201cWhat Manner of Man: A Biography of Martin Luther King Jr.\u201d (1964), \u201cBlack Power U.S.A.: The Human Side of Reconstruction, 1867-1877\u201d (1967) and \u201cThe Shaping of Black America\u201d (1975).\n\nIn 1965 he married Gloria Sylvester. She died in 2009. His survivors include their daughters, Joy, Constance and Courtney, and three grandchildren. A son, Lerone III, died in 2013. Mr. Bennett lived in Chicago.\n\nIn an oral history recorded in 2010 for the National Visionary Leadership Project, which collects the stories of notable black Americans, Mr. Bennett talked about a three-part approach to affecting change.\n\n\u201cEvery black person is obligated,\u201d he said, \u201cto try to do what he does as well as any person who ever lived can do it, or any person who ever lives can do it; then, to try to save one \u2014 just one \u2014 person if you can. And then to struggle to destroy a system which is multiplying black victims faster than all the black intellectuals and the black leaders in America can talk about.

Townships have gotten electricity and more modern housing. Government contracts have been set aside for black would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nThese programs have had an impact, improving material conditions and generating jobs.\n\nThey have also been riddled with corruption.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt local governments across South Africa, bureaucrats have abused their authority to steer contracts to companies that put cash in their pockets. At every level of society, people have grown accustomed to kickbacks and political connections determining who prospers, and who goes without.\n\nMr. Zuma\u2019s demise resonates as a sign of a potential new order taking shape. He will forever be linked to his association with the Guptas, three Indian-born brothers who effectively bought key levers of governmental power, amassing influence so comprehensive that it became known as \u201cstate capture.\u201d\n\nHis resignation has raised hopes that South Africa is finally contending with its epidemic of corruption. That view gained momentum when an elite police unit raided a home belonging to the Guptas nearly at the same moment that Mr. Ramaphosa was assuming office.\n\nThe new president is a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle, a former deputy president and chairman of the National Planning Commission, a focal point for thinking about how to engineer economic growth. As a former trade union leader and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Mandela, he enjoys credibility among a range of interest groups, while carrying a reputation as a savvy and strategic operator.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe has had his brushes with controversy, most notably after a 2012 police massacre of striking platinum miners that killed 34 people. At the time, Mr. Ramaphosa occupied a seat on the board of Lonmin, the company that owned the mine. Emails soon surfaced showing that, a day before the police opened fire, Mr. Ramaphosa had been urging senior government officials to take strong action to end the strike.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, no corruption charges have stuck to the new president, who now claims a mandate to clean up the toxic mess left behind by Mr. Zuma.\n\nSome doubt whether the A.N.C. can be salvaged as an effective vehicle for egalitarian policymaking. The party\u2019s executive ranks include many figures implicated in corruption. Mr. Ramaphosa, 65, may champion new initiatives aimed at generating economic growth, yet he finds himself relying on his party brethren to execute his visions, with no certainty that the money will land where intended.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think that taking the president out does much to dismantle the patronage network,\u201d said Ayabonga Cawe, a development economist at Xesibe Holdings, a research and advisory firm in Johannesburg. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need a lot more than taking out the guy at the top.\u201d\n\nAbove all, Mr. Ramaphosa must contend with the structural defects that have long constrained South Africa\u2019s economy, a legacy of apartheid.\n\nBeyond its systemic discrimination against black people, apartheid severed the country from much of the global economy. It ensured that huge numbers of uneducated black South Africans were available at poverty-level wages within major sectors of the economy like mining, agriculture and textiles. That cushioned domestic companies from the pressure to modernize.\n\nPhoto\n\nInternational sanctions isolated South Africa, shielding its firms from competition against multinational rivals. Sanctions also denied South African companies the ability to operate abroad, giving them an incentive to focus on the domestic market. The apartheid-era government obliged with subsidies for favored firms while allowing companies to pursue oligopoly, free of nuisances like antitrust law.\n\nThe result was a system in which large industries, from retail to furniture-making to chemicals, were dominated by huge enterprises whose core strength was the ability to protect themselves against competition. That system has largely prevailed, with smaller companies and start-ups facing often-impossible odds.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cApartheid was a system that lends itself to large conglomerates and concentrations of wealth in the hands of a few,\u201d Mr. Cawe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the corruption. It\u2019s about all of these parallel networks in big business that you need to dismantle. Most of those are white.\u201d\n\nHere is a world that Mr. Ramaphosa knows keenly, having achieved extraordinary affluence by running South African companies with interests in mining, banking, real estate and telecommunications. His fortune has been estimated at $450 million.\n\nIf he is serious about reinvigorating the economy and creating a space for black-owned small businesses, he will need to take on the prevailing structure that made him so wealthy.\n\nHis success on that front may be even more decisive than whether he can tame corruption.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly the most optimistic moment for South Africa in a very long time,\u201d said Mr. Goldin, the former adviser to Mr. Mandela. \u201cIn a way, it does feel like a new beginning.

The aggressive pace of deportations of immigrants of color, the elimination of the DACA program protecting immigrant children and the proposals propounded by the anti-immigration voices in the administration will all have the undeniable effect of slowing the rapid racial diversification of the United States population. Despite this sweeping attempt at racial social engineering, few voices in progressive and Democratic circles are responding with the kinds of outrage that one would expect.\n\nThe pro-white preferences of Donald Trump and his administration, especially when it comes to immigration, are legion. From the day he opened his presidential campaign in 2015 by demonizing Mexicans to the enthusiasm generated by the calls for building a wall along the Mexican border to aggressively ramping up deportations of immigrants of color to eliminating DACA to vulgarly denigrating African nations and Haiti, this administration has been quite clear about its preference for white people.\n\nIt should be no surprise, then, that the immigration policies championed by the White House would all have the effect of reducing the number of people of color coming into the country. A recent study by The Washington Post found that the administration\u2019s proposals to curtail legal immigration by limiting family reunification would slightly delay the date when whites become a minority. \u201cBy greatly slashing the number of Hispanic and black African immigrants entering America, this proposal would reshape the future United States,\u201d the economist Michael Clemens said.\n\n\u201cDecades ahead,\u201d he added, \u201cmany fewer of us would be nonwhite or have nonwhite people in our families.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe administration\u2019s focus is not random.

People of color used to make up 12 percent of the United States population in 1965, and that percentage has more than tripled over the past several decades to the point where nonwhite people are nearly 39 percent of the residents of the United States (it is no accident that the country\u2019s first African-American president was elected when he was elected). Mr. Trump\u2019s team understands that the specific laws it seeks to eliminate have played a significant role in that demographic revolution.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

The very first immigration law passed, the Naturalization Act of 1790, declared that to become a citizen, one had to be a \u201cfree white person.\u201d That demarcation was the explicit law of the land for the next 162 years, until 1952. There are 20th-century Supreme Court cases explicitly holding that Asian immigrants could not become United States citizens because they were not white. Even after 1952, the practical effect of immigration policy continued to promote white people above others through mechanisms such as the Asia Pacific Triangle, which restricted immigration from Asian countries.", "keywords": ["trump", "effect", "immigrants", "nonwhite", "sign", "color", "population", "white", "immigration", "united", "wants", "states", "america"], "polarity": 0.07678771845438513, "subjectivity": 0.2882194965528299},

Almost all of those who led the campaign to bring him to account were black, like Thuli Madonsela, the former public protector, who played a heroic role in exposing Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption. South Africa\u2019s judiciary, which is majority black, defended the independence of the courts with extraordinary courage and under great pressure. After this display of black courage, why would it matter what white people think?\n\nBut South Africa is too fraught and complex a place for such a simple story to ring true. More plausible is that each pinprick penetrating Mr. Zuma\u2019s skin is felt by black South Africans, even those who are horrified by what he has done.\n\nBeneath the surface of public life, one can detect a strange, subliminal to-and-fro. Last year, for instance, a superb book describing in meticulous detail the deep corruption of the late apartheid years, \u201cApartheid Guns and Money,\u201d by Hennie van Vuuren, was a runaway best seller. It deserved to be widely read, but the scale of its success is partly a function of its utility as a weapon against white arrogance. \u201cHowever bad Zuma is,\u201d its many black readers could say to themselves, \u201cyou people were worse.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nTo shrug and say that we are all equally capable of stealing public money is to miss what is distinctive about the mess Mr. Zuma has made. For the truth is that Mr. Zuma and his allies were corrupt partly because they felt a sense of grievance intimately connected to their experience of race.\n\nWhen Mr. Zuma became president of South Africa in 2009, he rallied behind him an alliance of people who felt themselves to be marginal and neglected, not just in relation to the world economic order or white South Africa but also in relation to the A.N.C. itself. The A.N.C. has been run by people drawn from the ranks of an urbane, cosmopolitan elite.\n\nMr. Zuma represented a dramatic change in this tradition. Although he spent years in exile and climbed the ranks of the A.N.C., his biography was unlike any of his predecessors\u2019. Nelson Mandela was born into royalty. Thabo Mbeki was the son of prominent intellectuals. Mr. Zuma\u2019s mother worked in the kitchen of a white family and was too poor to provide her son with a formal education. He grew up herding cattle in the hinterland.\n\nWhen he came to power in 2009, he did so with the support of organizations representing much of the urban working class \u2014 the country\u2019s largest trade union and the South African Communist Party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut he soon dropped these organizations and turned for support to rural South Africa, in particular to traditional leaders and to the elites of far-flung provincial capitals. They carried with them into power an abiding sense of powerlessness, a feeling that the very institutions they now controlled were alien and belonged to others. In office, they believed that they had entered into their enemy\u2019s mansion. It seemed to be payback time.\n\nIn a speech delivered to a room of black businesspeople in December 2016, Mr. Zuma warned of the sophisticated ways in which the enemy confuses black people. One source of such confusion was the prevailing economic orthodoxy. Mr. Zuma suggested that the most fundamental of economic laws was merely nominal; remove the scales from our eyes and we see that so-called economic laws are a ruse invented by the powerful.\n\nHis genre of criminality is light-years from the sort that characterized the apartheid state. The corruption of apartheid\u2019s leaders stemmed from arrogance; they believed that they could control the world forever. Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption stems from the grievances of a man who feels very small.\n\nThis sense of grievance was on display in the last words he uttered publicly as president. In a swipe at his successor, Mr. Ramaphosa, Mr. Zuma suggested that those in the party who had unseated him were \u201cserving the interests of the oppressors of yesteryear, who joyfully celebrate as we lynch one another.\u201d\n\nBlack nationalism in South Africa has many faces. Mr. Ramaphosa represents a strand that is bourgeois, worldly and comfortable with power. There is also a militant, socialist strand of black nationalism, but it is on the wane. And there is the strand represented by Mr. Zuma, who governed as a man shaped and distorted by the violence and oppression of white supremacy.\n\nI am of course alive to the irony of a white South African like me saying that a black president\u2019s corruption was motivated by racial grievance. Many South Africans, black and white, would regard this argument as an excuse for the intolerable. But we should be honest enough to accept that even now, notwithstanding that apartheid has been gone since before nearly half the South African population was born, the legacy of white supremacy has lived on in the man who was president.", "keywords": ["zuma", "mr", "black", "distinctive", "apartheid", "corruption", "mess", "white", "africa", "jacob", "zumas", "whats", "economic", "south"], "polarity": 0.0616115067727971, "subjectivity": 0.37158776707163793},

Evenly lit, crisply photographed, they look like pictures from an illustrated medical dictionary, indexical images of heads, torsos and mouths that are detached from context. Even in a work like \u201cFigure\u201d (1991), the figure in question, sheathed in a black dress and set in the black infinity of no particular place, feels like a fragment, as though she had been extracted from a group photo or a furnished room. The texts accompanying her, eight engraved plastic plaques, read like excerpts from a language primer: \u201cfigured the worst,\u201d \u201che was disfigured,\u201d \u201cfigured there would be no reaction\u201d and so on. Here, not only has the story been winnowed down; it is in fact completely gone. There\u2019s no story. We are left with only the tensions of concrete poetry.\n\nSometime in the mid-1990s, Simpson began to detect clich\u00e9d responses to her work. At the same time, her own thinking was evolving. What does an image of a black woman mean? A commentary on race? An assertion about gender? Simpson branched out from figure-based images and began to experiment more with varied subject matter \u2014 landscapes and inanimate objects like wigs \u2014 and also with unusual quasi-sculptural material like felt and standing screens. A series of monumental multisectional images, several of them landscapes, collectively titled \u201cPublic Sex\u201d (1995-1998) and featuring no figures at all, addressed the provocative title only obliquely. These pictures, made over many years, contain what the scholar and curator Okwui Enwezor calls \u201cthe rumor of the body.\u201d Mysteries of a jagged and deadpan sort, they would go on to influence the noirish tone of Simpson\u2019s later film work.\n\nPhoto\n\nSimpson began to set ever more intricate conceptual layers between her initial inspiration for a work and the finished product. The idea for \u201c9 Props\u201d (1995) began during a residency at the Pilchuck Glass School in Washington. With the aid of artisans at the school, she fabricated a series of dark vessels modeled on vases and other objects used in the portrait work of the pioneering Harlem photographer James Van Der Zee. But these vessels were not the final work. She shipped them back to New York and then photographed them against a plain background. And that still was not the work. Further intervention followed: She turned those photographic images into nine lithographs, which she printed on felt. Finally, she wrote captions below each lithographed vessel, describing the context in which it originally appeared. One of them, for instance, reads:\n\nDinner Party with boxer Harry Wills, 1926 James VanDerZee Harry Wills a k a \u201cThe Black Panther,\u201d boxer, businessman- sits with seven other men and women, mostly women with champagne glasses raised as a woman on his left makes a toast in his honor. There are three bottles of champagne, a crystal decanter, a bottle of port, an arrangement of flowers and fruit, and before each guest an untouched china place setting.\n\nPhoto\n\nFrom multiple directions, the work gestures at what cannot be seen: the original placement of the vessels that inspired Simpson\u2019s own, the people in the photographs by James Van Der Zee, the social life of Harlem evoked by his photographs and the complexity of manners and class implied by them. All that vanished world of culture and experience is reduced to an elegant grid, as simple as an antiquarian\u2019s catalog, a thought picture that demands calm engagement and imaginative intervention on the viewer\u2019s part. Without being representational, it is about race; but race is not off in some category by itself, hemmed in only by questions of skin color, separate from life.\n\n\u201cRepresent!\u201d in the black American sense means standing up for your people, expressing solidarity and letting a shared ethos underwrite your presence and work. It is an exhortation, a greeting and a farewell. The word also has more conventional associations. In the visual arts, it is contrasted with the abstract or the symbolic. To represent, in this more common sense, is to make work that visually corresponds to realities out there in the world: to illustrate uncomplicatedly. This second sense of \u201crepresent\u201d is enjoying a vogue in the art world. Realism is back. This is welcome: after so long an absence of black figures and black faces in art museums, they are now being seen more frequently. Many artists, black and otherwise, are depicting the black body. It is necessary and often successful. Just as often, it fails when it is little more than a clumsy shorthand for socially concerned art, unobjectionable and unimpressive.\n\nA strong appeal of Simpson\u2019s work is that she has always embraced the inherent complexity of blackness, her own blackness as well as the blackness that runs ineluctably through American history. She does not reject representational depictions, but neither does she feel the need to confine herself only to \u201crace\u201d work. When an artist uses a black model, she is presenting a human question by foregrounding a human presence. Is a white man a person while a black woman is and can only be a gendered and racialized subject? As the scholar Kellie Jones has pointed out, nonwhite bodies are often thought of as \u201cnot neutral enough for the dispassionate formulas thought to constitute conceptual practice.\u201d If a black woman\u2019s race and gender are the only things apparent to certain viewers, Simpson seems to say, the ethical responsibility to escape those shackles is the viewer\u2019s.\n\nFreedom is Lorna Simpson\u2019s starting point and her permanent theme. A humane current animates all of her work, a current that neither sidesteps nor confines itself to race. Her work is simultaneously about the \u201cneutral\u201d space of ideas and the particularized experience of the body. \u201cMontage\u201d is photographic and painterly, a riff on a pair of found photographs, sequenced to look like a giant strip of film. It deals with dreams and nightmares, ambiguities and vulnerabilities. At its heart is what Simpson calls \u201cthe push and pull of photography\u201d: the stuttering potential inherent in mechanical reproduction and the imperfect registrations that mirror subconscious life. It is a rapid response to the current political climate, situating a crucial part of it in the most intimate space of all, where the hectoring \u201cthey\u201d is temporarily held at bay in favor of the puzzled \u201cI.\u201d In your own sleeping bed, images persist and words are hard to come by.

There would be retaliation for stories they didn\u2019t like, but nothing compared with this. There\u2019s a war going on.

This is a key piece that I don\u2019t think people really get: When you talk about the press, it\u2019s not about journalists; it\u2019s about the free-flowing information that the American public is supposed to get. When you bash the press, you\u2019re bashing the idea of getting truth out.\n\nWhat\u2019s the public opinion of the White House press corps? It depends on whom you talk to. We\u2019re so tribal now.

Yes, I have. But I have to shake that off, because I have to go in and do my job. I cover the White House. I cover all issues, particularly those that affect black and brown Americans.

There has been a series of comments or lack of action, from calling Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas\u201d to how he dealt with Charlottesville to his comments on Norway versus Haiti, Africa, El Salvador, black and brown nations. It\u2019s not been one thing. It\u2019s been a pattern. So I asked. He did not answer, which I thought was a wasted moment. He could have put it to rest right then and there and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a racist.\u201d But it took him days to say that.\n\nYou said it seems as if it has changed, going forward, how the White House deals with the press corps and wields its power. What do you think this means for the next president you cover? He\u2019ll clamp down harder on us. Each president has pushed us further away from access. Who knows what will happen or what another president may want? They may not want to be followed. President Obama didn\u2019t like being followed, for example. This president hates us. He\u2019s warring on us.

Just like our kid who\u2019s not white dresses up like Captain America. I think the beautiful thing about comics is they do transcend race in a lot of ways.\u201d\n\nMary Dimacali, 29, a social media and marketing manager in Rockland County, New York, echoed that idea. She does not believe that her fianc\u00e9\u2019s 7-year-old son, Sawyer, who is white, sees the film or its characters through the lens of race. Sawyer himself, during the interview with Ms. Dimacali, said, \u201csure,\u201d when she asked if he\u2019d like to dress up as Black Panther.\n\n\u201cFor a white kid to be so open and judge based on the character\u2019s story and the personality and history, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s important,\u201d she said. \u201cBut on the flip side, I think it\u2019s also great to have a black superhero you can identify and connect to.\u201d\n\nThe character\u2019s history is unique. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1966, Black Panther rules as the king of an African technological utopia known as Wakanda. Untouched by European invaders, Wakanda exists apart from the legacies of colonization and racism. Black history and black fantasy are central to the character, and the series has brought on prominent black writers including Ta-Nehisi Coates to deepen its significance over the last 50 years.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

He is completing \u201cRise of the Black Panther,\u201d a six-part comic series for Marvel that traces the character\u2019s early history. He has tried to explain some of that history to his 7-year-old daughter, but without delving too deeply into complex concepts like Western imperialism, which she may struggle to grasp.\n\n\u201cYou want that white kid to be able to think that he can dress up in a Black Panther costume, because, to that kid, there\u2019s no difference between Captain America and Black Panther,\u201d Mr. Narcisse, 45, said. But, he added, it also involves \u201ctrying to explain what is special about T\u2019Challa and Wakanda without racism.

It\u2019s projected to make a record-breaking $165 million over Presidents\u2019 Day weekend and comparisons to last year\u2019s \u201cWonder Woman\u201d bode well for its reception and impact, particularly for black people.\n\n\u201cWhite people have the privilege of not constantly being reminded of their race in the United States, where white is the majority, whereas as a black person you don\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Vittrup said. She believes that parents in general, and white parents in particular, are reluctant to talk about race with young children. When they do, they often miss the chance to talk about inequality, even though research supports the idea that children develop an awareness of race and difference at a very young age.\n\nMs. Vittrup was careful to add that dressing as Black Panther isn\u2019t inherently appropriative or offensive. The character comes from an invented African country, and to wear his mask isn\u2019t quite the same as wearing blackface. However, in a moment where even more black heroes, like Luke Cage and Black Lightning, are finding their way into the limelight, Black Panther\u2019s relationship with the black community and its history creates an opportunity to teach nonblack children about the black experience.\n\n\u201cKids are not colorblind,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of structural inequality in our society, and kids are noticing that.

Even the clothes are an 18th-century version of current POTUS style: basic black suit and fat tie. As for Washington, he stands blank-faced, one arm extended, like a tenor taking a dignified bow.\n\n[Read remarks from the Obamas and the artists. ]\n\nUninflected dignity was the attitude of choice for well over a century, with a few breaks. In an 1836 portrait, Andrew Jackson, a demonstrative bully, sports a floor-length, red-silk-lined Dracula cloak and a kind of topiary bouffant. (A picture of Jackson, one of President Trump\u2019s populist heroes, hangs in the Oval Office.) Abraham Lincoln, seen in several likenesses, is exceptional for looking as if he may actually have weighty matters on his mind. Most of the portraits that precede and follow his are pure P.R.\n\nThis continues well into the 20th century. In a 1980 painting Jimmy Carter trades a black suit for a beige one. How revolutionary is that? And there\u2019s a Casual Fridays vogue: Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both go tieless for it. Under the circumstances, Elaine de Kooning\u2019s 1963 portrait of John F. Kennedy, a fanfare of green and blue strokes, hits like a boost of adrenaline. Rousing too, though not in a good way, is a big head shot image of Bill Clinton by the artist Chuck Close. Using his signature mosaic-like painting technique, Mr. Close turns the 42nd president into a pixelated clown.\n\nMr. Obama has much better luck with his similarly high-profile portraitist. Mr. Wiley, born in Los Angeles in 1977, gained a following in the early 2000s with his crisp, glossy, life-size paintings of young African-American men dressed in hip-hop styles, but depicted in the old-master manner of European royal portraits. More recently he has expanded his repertoire to include female subjects, as well as models from Brazil, India, Nigeria and Senegal, creating the collective image of a global black aristocracy.\n\nIn an imposingly scaled painting \u2014 just over seven feet tall \u2014 the artist presents Mr. Obama dressed in the regulation black suit and an open-necked white shirt, and seated on a vaguely thronelike chair not so different from the one seen in Stuart\u2019s Washington portrait. But art historical references stop there. So do tonal echoes of past portraits. Whereas Mr. Obama\u2019s predecessors are, to the man, shown expressionless and composed, Mr. Obama sits tensely forward, frowning, elbows on his knees, arms crossed, as if listening hard. No smiles, no Mr. Nice Guy. He\u2019s still troubleshooting, still in the game.\n\nVideo\n\nHis engaged and assertive demeanor contradicts \u2014 and cosmetically corrects \u2014 the impression he often made in office of being philosophically detached from what was going on around him. At some level, all portraits are propaganda, political or personal. And what makes this one distinctive is the personal part. Mr. Wiley has set Mr. Obama against \u2014 really embedded him in \u2014 a bower of what looks like ground cover. From the greenery sprout flowers that have symbolic meaning for the sitter. African blue lilies represent Kenya, his father\u2019s birthplace; jasmine stands for Hawaii, where Mr. Obama himself was born; chrysanthemums, the official flower of Chicago, reference the city where his political career began, and where he met his wife.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMrs. Obama\u2019s choice of Ms. Sherald as an artist was an enterprising one. Ms. Sherald, who was born in Columbus, Ga., in 1973 and lives in Baltimore, is just beginning to move into the national spotlight after putting her career on hold for some years to deal with a family health crisis, and one of her own. (She had a heart transplant at 39.) Production-wise, she and Mr. Wiley operate quite differently. He runs the equivalent of a multinational art factory, with assistants churning out work. Ms. Sherald, who until a few years ago made her living waiting tables, oversees a studio staff of one, herself.\n\nAt the same time, they have much in common. Both focused early on African-American portraiture precisely because it is so little represented in Western art history. And both tend to blend fact and fiction. Mr. Wiley, with photo-realistic precision, casts actual people in fantastically heroic roles. (He modifies his heroizing in the case of Mr. Obama, but it\u2019s still there.) Ms. Sherald also starts with realism, but softens and abstracts it. She gives all her figures gray-toned skin \u2014 a color with ambiguous racial associations \u2014 and reduces bodies to geometric forms silhouetted against single-color fields.\n\nShe shows Mrs. Obama sitting against a field of light blue, wearing a spreading gown. The dress design, by Michelle Smith, is eye-teasingly complicated: mostly white interrupted by black Op Art-ish blips and patches of striped color suggestive of African textiles. The shape of the dress, rising pyramidally upward, mountain-like, feels as if it were the real subject of the portrait. Mrs. Obama\u2019s face forms the composition\u2019s peak, but could be almost anyone\u2019s face, like a model\u2019s face in a fashion spread. To be honest, I was anticipating \u2014 hoping for \u2014 a bolder, more incisive image of the strong-voiced person I imagine this former first lady to be.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m wishing, let me mention something more. Mr. Obama\u2019s portrait will be installed, long-term, among those of his presidential peers, in a dedicated space on the second floor. Mrs. Obama\u2019s will hang in a corridor reserved for temporary displays of new acquisitions \u2014 on the first floor. It will stay there until November, after which there\u2019s no set-aside place for it to land.\n\nIf first men have an acknowledged showcase, first women \u2014 ladies or not \u2014 should too. Better, they should all be together, sharing space, offering a welcoming environment to, among others, a future first female president, and creating a lasting monument to #MeToo.", "keywords": ["portrait", "fact", "mr", "black", "ms", "paint", "portraits", "blend", "sherald", "fiction", "washington", "wiley", "politics", "obama", "obamas"], "polarity": 0.07208600786186993, "subjectivity": 0.35921572042261696},

While it is true that compared with Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton lost ground with that segment of the electorate, the clues to a new Democratic majority may be found in the coalition that elected Mr. Northam governor of Virginia, or perhaps more accurately, voted against Mr. Gillespie and his immigrant bashing.\n\nIn Virginia, polling data has made it clear that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 rhetoric backfired among minority voters as well as, crucially, among many whites. Mr. Northam won a majority of white college-educated voters, who made up a larger share of the electorate in 2017 than they did in 2016. Mr. Gillespie matched Mr. Trump with noncollege whites, but their turnout was down. And minority voters in 2017 matched their 2016 electorate share \u2014 for the first time ever there was no drop-off from the presidential to the gubernatorial election. The Democrats also expanded their margin of victory in Virginia from five percentage points in 2016 to nine points in 2017.\n\nBefore the vote in Virginia, pundits on both the right and left were speculating that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s anti-immigrant strategy was working. But in the end, election results and polling data in Virginia proved all that thinking was wrong. While each state has its own demographics and distinct politics, Virginia has voters who span demographic and economic spectrums. Majorities of voters of all races and ethnicities rejected anti-immigrant stereotypes as ugly and wrong.\n\nAccording to an election eve survey of voters by Latino Decisions, Latino voters said that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads made them less enthusiastic about him, by a 45-point margin. But it wasn\u2019t just Latino voters. By a 23-point margin (52 to 29), whites in Virginia also said the MS-13 ads turned them away from Mr. Gillespie, as did African-American and Asian-American voters by larger margins.\n\nData speaks louder than punditry, and our regression analysis of survey data paints a clear picture. Exposure to Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads actually helped drive white college-educated voters away from the Republicans. When we analyzed findings for white independents and Republicans, voters who were aware of the MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Mr. Gillespie\u2019s Democratic opponent. What should be alarming for Republicans is that this effect wasn\u2019t limited to the governor\u2019s race. The Gillespie campaign had coattail effects, but of the wrong stripe. Across all racial groups, those who were aware of Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Democratic candidates for Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates.\n\nThis means that not only is it morally just for Democrats to position themselves as the party that stands against hatred and bigotry and in favor of inclusiveness and opportunity, but it is also a strategically sound position for winning votes. Simultaneously, it sends a clear, welcoming message to Latino, African-American and Asian-American voters, while also winning over enough of the white voters who also oppose immigrant bashing.\n\nThis phenomenon is particularly true of voters who will decide crucial House and Senate races in 2018: people of color and white college-educated voters \u2014 also known as the Democratic base. Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans are clearly gearing up for a similar anti-immigrant effort in 2018. But now the mask has been pulled off. Voters get it.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nYet, despite the obvious truth of that statement, we may wonder: What are the moral and political arguments that underwrite the claim that black lives matter? While there is no way to articulate the full scope of those arguments in a single essay, it\u2019s worth considering the philosophical contributions of some of the forerunners of the movement that is our most urgent manifestation of black thought today.\n\nThe end of the Civil War and the subsequent ratification of the 13th Amendment in 1865 legally abolished slavery, but blacks quickly became subject to a displaced form of violence at the hands of white supremacists across the nation who typically used false accusations of sexual assault to justify lynching black men. Police turned a blind eye to these murders, and sometimes actively facilitated them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIda B. Wells, a leading black thinker and journalist in the late-19th and early 20th centuries, and a co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, built a public career documenting lynchings and calling America to account for them. Her arguments extended and amplified those made by Frederick Douglass before her. Douglass\u2019s central claim in his seminal \u201cThe Meaning of July Fourth for the Negro\u201d was that Americans should feel shame for slavery, given their country\u2019s foundational commitment to liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We were failing our own ideals.\n\nWells pointed to the rise of lynching after the fall of slavery as not merely a legal matter to be rectified with new laws. Having fled her hometown to escape threats of her own lynching, Wells used the press to make her moral arguments. She described a nation in the grip of a dark remorse for freeing black Americans from slavery, and condemned white Americans for cruelties that violated their own commitment to the democratic project.\n\nThe horrors that Wells described were a factor in the Great Migration of blacks to the North, which fed the flourishing of black thought and cultural life that gave rise to the Harlem Renaissance. An indication that the Harlem Renaissance was always meant to be a period of radical black philosophy and social change was the name originally coined for the movement: The New Negro. Alain Locke, the Harvard-educated black intellectual who became known as the father of the Harlem Renaissance, envisioned a philosophical position that reinvigorated blacks\u2019 relationship to their culture and that would in turn solidify their status as equal co-participants in our democracy.\n\nA strong theme among some of the luminaries of the time focused on the will of blacks to assert their humanity against racism and to insist on their status as persons owed respect. Among those stars, the poet Langston Hughes was one of the brightest. His \u201cI Too\u201d is a quiet yet insistent poem depicting a black man employed by a white one and his struggle with invisibility. The protagonist resolves to sit at the table with the white folks the next day and show people how beautiful he is and that he, too, is America. The writer Zora Neale Hurston had an equally persistent but at times more playful take on the matter. In her essay \u201cHow It Feels to Be Colored Me,\u201d she wrote, \u201cSometimes, I feel discriminated against, but it does not make me angry. It merely astonishes me. How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company! It\u2019s beyond me.\u201d\n\nThinkers like Hughes and Hurston were involved in the Harlem Renaissance project of presenting a vision of black cultural vitality and worth that would rework the image of black Americans that whites typically relied upon. That stream of thought runs directly into the heart of Black Lives Matter.\n\nAnother valuable and necessary development to come out of the Black Lives Matter movement is the de-emphasizing of black patriarchy and the equal acknowledgment of the suffering of black women and the black L.G.T.B.Q. community. Though sexuality was an avenue of inquiry during the Harlem Renaissance, it was perhaps the mid- to late-20th century poet and theorist Audre Lorde who did the most to make black women\u2019s sexuality a focal point of political and social philosophy.\n\nWhile today \u201cintersectionality\u201d is bandied about as the cutting edge of social research, it was Lorde who in her writing insisted on complicating our view of personal identity by claiming that each of us belongs to multiple identity communities, all of which contribute to our sense of self and our purposes.\n\nShe also showed the broad reach of white supremacy and its effects on black Americans as they located themselves in more nuanced ways in the tapestry of American culture. For her, the primary form taken by resistance to racism was the denial of blunt categories imposed on black Americans, which stifled the possibility of an individual\u2019s full flourishing. Lorde, then, called for a radical form of self-possession whose boundaries were not open to negotiation with a white society.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen people think of Black Lives Matter, they often think of anger feeding forceful protests. Anger is a reasonable response to racial injustice. To be certain, groups like the Black Panthers and thinkers like Malcolm X advised black Americans to get angry and take the doctrine of armed self-defense seriously. Though anger and love are not mutually exclusive emotions, James Baldwin and Martin Luther King Jr. affirmed a view of civic love to pre-empt the need for violence.\n\nKing espoused a form of Kantian regard that prioritized conceiving of every human, racist or not, as owed a kind of love that is grounded in the ideal of universal respect. Baldwin held a slightly different view. He felt black Americans ought to see whites as democratic kin or family, as people with whom blacks would have serious quarrels but also people whom it would be worth keeping close in order to strengthen and bring integrity to the bonds of shared democratic life. These two views of love eschewed violence yet insisted on militancy. While forgiveness and acceptance were hallmarks of King\u2019s and Baldwin\u2019s views, so was an unyielding commitment to self-respect and the demand for social change to institutionalize the idea that blacks were co-creators of the American kingdom.\n\nThinkers like Wells, Hughes, Hurston, Lorde and Baldwin not only anticipated the current Black Lives Matter movement but provided an intellectual blueprint to give depth and integrity to that slogan, so that its meaning transcends the demand to stop police brutality. It is a demand for whites to extend their historical imagination and recognize that the ills of racism are not the result of a few bad police officers or a few out-and-out racists in some far-off corner of America. The problem, rather, is a kind of complicity \u2014 one partaking in the false comfort that America has somehow escaped the trajectory of its racially murderous history. It is necessary that we to see our society today as continuous with that history and not anomalous to it.\n\nBlack thought\u2019s primary contribution to the academy and to American society is the richness and precision with which it describes our worst demons to us, while offering a vision of how we might each save our democracy from the ruin of irrational fear and hatred.", "keywords": ["americans", "lives", "movement", "black", "blacks", "renaissance", "matter", "showed", "white", "harlem", "america"], "polarity": 0.043612258953168, "subjectivity": 0.3973699190419967},

Bell Pottinger may have set back race relations in South Africa by as much as 10 years.\u201d\n\nWithin days of the firm\u2019s removal from the trade association, clients were fleeing. By the end of September, all 250 employees were laid off and Bell Pottinger was finished.\n\nA Unique Client List\n\nLondon is now home to a cluster of P.R. firms catering to foreign governments, raising worries that the city has become \u201cthe global capital of reputation laundering,\u201d as The Evening Standard put it a few years ago. Bell Pottinger established the template of this lucrative niche.\n\nIt was largely the brainchild of Tim Bell, who had earned his reputation, along with a knighthood, helping Margaret Thatcher win three elections. He came to fame with the \u201cLabour isn\u2019t working\u201d ads that helped the Conservative Party gain control of Parliament in the 1979 general election. Colleagues actually coined the phrase, and he talked Mrs. Thatcher into adopting it.\n\n\u201cThere were many conversations in which she shouted at me and told me I was an idiot,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI just had to stand my ground and say, \u2018I know what I\u2019m doing.\u2019\u201d\n\nNow 77, Mr. Bell appears to have stepped directly out of an Evelyn Waugh novel with everything but a smoking jacket. Gray haired with an owlish pair of black glasses, he speaks with jaunty indifference and ingratiating candor, a combination that always made the tsk-tskers who disapproved of his client list sound unworldly and na\u00efve.\n\n\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Breaking News Emails Sign up to receive an email from The New York Times as soon as important news breaks around the world.

When the pair started working together in the mid-80s, Mr. Bell was sought after by political leaders and corporations who wanted some of the communications magic he had provided to Mrs. Thatcher.\n\nBell Pottinger quickly had hundreds of clients, a few of them infamous. Mr. Bell attributes his ability to work with virtually anyone to innate optimism.\n\n\u201cI see the good in people,\u201d he said.\n\nThis included Chile\u2019s former dictator Augusto Pinochet. Mr. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain in 1998 as part of an effort to deport him to Spain, where he had been indicted on a charge of torturing Spanish citizens.\n\nAfter two years of legal and political wrangling, Mr. Bell and his allies prevailed when Mr. Pinochet was authorized to freely return to Chile.\n\nBell Pottinger was hardly the only British outfit working for rogues and despots, as well as publicly traded companies, nor was it the largest or most profitable. But it had a buccaneering spirit that made it the firm of choice for a wide variety of missions.\n\n\n\nDuring the war in Iraq, Bell Pottinger had a contract with the Pentagon to produce propaganda for the United States military. This included scripts in Arabic for a soap opera that aired in the country, said Mr. Bell.\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen the company\u2019s client list did not generate news, its methods did. In 2011, it was caught boasting about its skills in the dark arts of search engine manipulation to people it thought were potential clients.\n\nIn fact, they were undercover members of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit organization that works with a variety of media. Posing as executives from the made-up Azimov Group, these \u201crepresentatives\u201d said the company had ties to the Uzbekistan regime, which has been criticized for repression and for using forced child labor during its cotton harvest.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Azimov executives said they worried about blowback.\n\nFret not, said Tim Collins, a Bell Pottinger managing director, per transcripts published by The Independent, a British newspaper. After the company applied its tech wizardry, \u201cYou get to the point where even if they type in \u2018Uzbek child labour\u2019 or \u2018Uzbek human rights violation,\u2019 some of the first results that come up are sites talking about what you guys are doing to address and improve that, not just the critical voices saying how terrible this all is.\u201d\n\nMr. Bell never challenged the transcripts, but he denounced the sting at the time as an \u201cunethical, underhand deception to manufacture a story where none exists.\u201d\n\nBeginning of the End\n\nBell Pottinger\u2019s slide into oblivion began with a visit to the Guptas in January 2016. Mr. Bell, who had worked in South Africa for years, said he had no idea what the brothers wanted, but he and several colleagues flew to Johannesburg to find out.\n\n\u201cWe went to this bloody great mansion, which seemed to be their headquarters,\u201d Mr. Bell recalled. \u201cGreat big room, huge sofas all over the place. Servants. Appalling, all of it.\u201d\n\nThe family already had a fortune, Tony Gupta told the small entourage. Now, he and his brothers wanted to help poor blacks. To that end, they wanted a P.R. campaign that pushed the idea of economic emancipation.\n\n\u201cSo we went back to London and wrote a strategy,\u201d said Mr. Bell. \u201cTown hall meetings, marching in the street, that kind of thing. Draw attention to the economic imbalance, then tell people they should protest and demand change.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe company drafted a two-page proposal, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times. Among its recommendations was \u201ca non-party political narrative around the existence of economic apartheid\u201d that Bell Pottinger would package \u201cinto speeches, news releases, website content, videos/broadcast content, slogans and other material required.\u201d\n\nSoon, the Guptas said that their company needed communications help, too. Most South Africans, the Guptas maintained, had an inflated notion of how much of the family\u2019s revenue came from government contracts, which harmed their interests, several Bell Pottinger employees recalled.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe corporate campaign was the first sign that altruism had little to do with the \u00a3100,000 a month that Bell Pottinger would earn during what was initially a three-month project. The second was the anger of the company\u2019s other South Africa clients when they learned of the arrangement.\n\nThe billionaire Johann Rupert was aghast to suddenly find himself one of the most prominent examples of \u201cwhite monopoly capital.\u201d He texted Mr. Bell and asked how his P.R. firm could also be working for a family that was bashing him. Mr. Bell, by his own account, quickly lost enthusiasm for the Gupta project.\n\n\u201cIt was altogether smelly,\u201d he said of the racial element of the work. But he quickly added that ethics were not the issue. If enough South African clients quit Bell Pottinger, he reasoned, the losses would outweigh the Guptas\u2019s checks. \u201cI was saying it\u2019s not a commercially sensible thing to do.\u201d\n\nBut by the end of March, only one client \u2014 the banking and asset management company Investec \u2014 had severed ties with the P.R. firm. After that, Bell Pottinger tried to find middle ground by signing a new contract with the Guptas, this time with a codicil literally called an anti-embarrassment clause. It allowed the firm to terminate the account \u201cwithout notice\u201d if the brothers brought discredit to the business.\n\nMr. Bell said he soon resolved to quit the company because he felt undermined and undervalued by Mr. Henderson. \u201cHe made my life a misery from start to finish,\u201d said Mr. Bell, speaking one recent afternoon in the living room of his home near London\u2019s Sloane Square. After negotiating a \u00a33.5 million exit package, Mr. Bell resigned in August 2016.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor his part, Mr. Henderson declined in a recent interview to indulge in the put-downs that come so easily to his antagonist. Seated at a conference table in temporary offices in Mayfair, where he is starting a new P.R. firm, he said Bell Pottinger\u2019s dissolution was too recent to discuss.\n\n\u201cI have huge empathy for all those impacted,\u201d he said, \u201cand believe now is not the appropriate time to go into details.\u201d\n\nInflaming Tensions\n\nThe P.R. campaign in South Africa, which started in 2016, was intended to raise the temperature of race relations. And it worked.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore than 100 fake Twitter accounts were created, all of them retweeting content from other Twitter accounts with names like @economycapture, according to media reports. Popular hashtags included #WhiteMonopolyCapital and #RespectGuptas. The campaign involved some 220,000 tweets.\n\nThere were also attack website with names like WMC Leaks and WMC Scams. Another part of this ecosystem were mainstream media outlets owned by the Guptas, like ANN7, a 24-hour news channel, and The New Age, a daily newspaper.\n\nAs the campaign spread, leaders at groups like the A.N.C. Youth League gave inflammatory speeches, decrying the \u201cstranglehold\u201d that rich whites had on the economy. Leaked emails would later show that the groups received media training, and in some cases funds, from Oakbay.\n\nAn atmosphere of menace slowly pervaded the country. In July 2016, the police minister announced the creation of a task force to investigate the murder of more than a dozen political figures. In the run-up to municipal elections that year, Mr. Zuma described the Democratic Alliance, the A.N.C.\u2019s main rival, as a \u201cwhite party,\u201d adding that it could not \u201crun this country no matter how they cover up by getting a few black stooges.\u201d\n\nNew and radical groups like Black First Land First sprang up, holding public rallies to fulminate against whites. At one, in May 2016, a pastor named Xola Skosana told the crowd, \u201cWe have been wounded beyond measure. Let us find the pillars and bring the house down. Black people must be avenged.\u201d\n\nFor the first time in years, whites felt a rising sense of personal danger. Nicholas Wolpe, a white South African whose father was a pioneer of the anti-apartheid movement, remembers a palpable anxiety. \u201cThere was a shift toward intolerance,\u201d he said. \u201cGradually, the debate about white monopoly capital was everywhere and the people talking about it were loud and belligerent. It struck a nerve.\u201d\n\nIn a related and surreptitious campaign, the Guptas were being recast as warmhearted people eager to help the downtrodden. A website connected to Black First Land First ran editorials defending the brothers, suggesting in one that they should be \u201cpraised for saving jobs.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["met", "campaign", "mr", "end", "reading", "main", "bell", "rogues", "pr", "company", "firm", "africa", "south", "pottinger", "guptas", "despots"], "polarity": 0.05728090899659527, "subjectivity": 0.3829289628309236},

Just as Ms. Robinson and Ms. Gilmore led the 1955-56 boycott of buses in Alabama, in the 1970s, women like Louise Day Hicks led the antibusing crusades in the North, in an effort to avoid the desegregation of Boston public schools. While men debated in legislative chambers and listened to challenges on the bench, women headed to school cafeterias, playgrounds and PTA meetings, doing the bulk of the behind-the-scenes work of supporting the politics of segregation.\n\nWhite women organized precinct gatherings to pressure their politicians to uphold Jim Crow laws. They transformed their homes into centers of bureaucratic efficiency \u2014 copying fliers, assigning neighborhoods for petition drives and scheduling protest shifts at elementary schools and bus garages.\n\nIt was also women who shaped the way segregation, white supremacy and ideas about racial identity were knitted into the fabric of their communities. Working as midwives, teachers and social workers, women policed the racial identity of babies, students and clients to ensure that the dividing line between white and black remained intact. And across the nation, women-led groups like Patriotic American Youth and the Women for Constitutional Government and Pro America spread the message to the next generation that opposition to racial equality was about states\u2019 rights and limited government, not white supremacy.\n\nIf narratives about white supremacy have been shaped by the overwhelmingly masculine lens through which we examine practically all political movements, there are also aspects of white supremacy that make it different. One critical factor here is the central role ascribed to white male sexual and status anxiety and lust for dominance in fomenting organized white-supremacist activities. As part of arguments against desegregation, many who belonged to these movements embraced a narrative that saw white women and girls as vulnerable (to black men), and white men as protectors \u2014 a story line that simultaneously elevated white men and rendered women helpmates and beneficiaries, not activists.\n\nBut this broader narrative obscures and even gives cover to the ways white women sometimes used white supremacy for their own gain. The suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt in the early 20th century argued for women\u2019s voting rights in Southern states on the basis that \u201cwhite supremacy will be strengthened, not weakened, by white women\u2019s suffrage.\u201d In the 1920s, the journalist Nell Battle Lewis of North Carolina never questioned the absolute need for racial segregation even as she criticized the violence committed in the name of Jim Crow. Staying in the racial fold, she was afforded the opportunity to blast her state\u2019s regressive labor and gender politics. Being a white supremacist, even a liberal one, meant that she remained part of the conversation.\n\nThe point, here, is neither to catalog nor to celebrate white women\u2019s contributions to white supremacist politics. Instead, their work should change how we understand history. It is easy to denounce the racist pronouncements and white-supremacist politics of a George Wallace or a Roy Moore. But what white women teach us is that white-supremacist politics is sustained at a much more grass-roots level by our neighbors, school boards and even friends. White women have made white supremacy a much more formidable and long-lasting force in American society, sustaining it at both the local and national levels.\n\nToday, it seems, the story America prefers to tell itself about white supremacy has changed little since the middle of the century: Instead of Klan lynchings, we focus on the rally in Charlottesville; instead of George Wallace, we focus on Jeff Sessions or, for that matter, Donald Trump. Outrage over the violence and rhetoric of these men buries an equally important and certainly more intransigent story of longstanding grass-roots and national campaigns populated partly by white women who aim to maintain racial and economic inequities on the American landscape. If we begin to consider their staying power with seriousness rather than surprise \u2014 a surprise not shared by black women \u2014 perhaps we can more effectively prepare to counter this strand of American politics.", "keywords": ["whitesupremacist", "racial", "power", "work", "supremacy", "white", "politics", "american", "womens", "women", "men"], "polarity": 0.08455011423761423, "subjectivity": 0.23956078643578646},

Aja did fine as a salty Crystal LaBeija, from the 1968 pageant documentary \u201cThe Queen,\u201d as did BeBe Zahara Benet, as Grace Jones.

Chi Chi DeVayne, on the other hand, faltered as Maya Angelou, misspelling Ms. Angelou\u2019s name right out of the gate.\n\nThe guest judge Kristin Chenoweth played as well. \u201cI always thought that one of these queens would do me, and no one ever did, so I decided to come here and do me,\u201d Ms. Chenoweth said, singing a high note, something I worry she does in restaurants.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cSweetheart, none of these queens are gonna do ya,\u201d BenDeLaCreme, as Mr. Lynde, quipped.\n\nAnd Trixie started out with a decent RuPaul impression that probably does get laughs in small doses but couldn\u2019t be sustained. \u201cYou\u2019ve won an uncomfortable phone call to your ex and a half-eaten hot dog from the back of my car,\u201d she interjected after another queen\u2019s answer, and Michelle Visage looked on, frozen, like an aunt at the Olympics whose niece just fell on the ice.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

So was BeBe, luscious in monochromatic dark blossoms. BenDeLaCreme, covered in orchids and shimmering butterflies, was named top two for the fourth week in a row. She was joined by Shangela, done up in a nod to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s floral-wreathed pregnancy announcement photo.\n\nIn the bottom: the inconsistent Kennedy, who was last week\u2019s winner; Chi Chi, lovely in lilies but adrift in the challenge; and a kaleidoscopically effloresced Trixie, who cried while the camera zoomed in.\n\n\u201cI get nervous here,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m at Camp Crystal Lake and Jason\u2019s outside with the machete.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget what you have, and what you offer, and who you are, whether this continues or not,\u201d Ms. Chenoweth said. (\u201cYeah,\u201d the producers of Trixie\u2019s hit Viceland show added, at home.)\n\nBackstage, the top two took meetings. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of you for continuing to plug away at this,\u201d BenDeLaCreme told Chi Chi, sounding a bit like the teacher of that painting class I shouldn\u2019t have taken.\n\nMeanwhile, Aja \u2014 who has calmly consoled so many queens backstage this season \u2014 sat with a vulnerable Trixie. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of drag in the real world,\u201d Trixie said, and I felt for her. She\u2019s gifted, perhaps just not at \u201cDrag Race.\u201d\n\nShangela, on the other hand, was born for this, holding court in yet another confessional. \u201cThis is the \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 of drag,\u201d she said, refusing to let an episode go by without making that comparison. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have alliances. Is Trixie Jon Snow, or is she Cersei Lannister?\u201d (Actually, right now I\u2019d say Trixie\u2019s more Season 3 Edmure Tully, firing arrows at his father\u2019s funeral boat and missing, am I right?)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter a lip-sync to Katy Perry\u2019s not-timeless \u201cI Kissed a Girl,\u201d both Shangela and BenDeLaCreme were crowned winners and, in a twist, each was given the chance to eliminate one of the bottom three queens. BenDeLaCreme eliminated Chi Chi, fine, and Shangela, who really did a supermarket sweep of this episode, milked the moment. \u201cThe person I\u2019ve chosen didn\u2019t leave with the crown, but they made a career,\u201d she said, teasing out what sounded like a Trixie elimination, only to reveal she\u2019d eliminated Chi Chi as well. (Warning shot: fired \u2014 and a sobbing Trixie clearly heard it.)\n\n\u201cThank you guys so much!\u201d Chi Chi said, waving. \u201cI\u2019m sad to go, but I think I did the best that I could,\u201d she added backstage, smiling. \u201c\u2018All Stars 3\u2019 was hard.\u201d\n\nFinally: a gracious exit. God, I love Chi Chi. Does she bake? If she can get to the U.K., and get a consistent layer of jam between two Victoria sponges, there\u2019s a show I\u2019d like to see her on.\n\nWill Shangela get played? Will Trixie finally triumph?

Even funnier was Kennedy\u2019s raunchy Party Girl, who also had trouble getting out of the limo, and hid bottle service in her padding. \u201cWe gonna make a toast to love,\u201d she said as Mr. Bowyer-Chapman disrobed for a massage by the pool, and the camera swooped in for a thirsty \u201cPlanet Earth\u201d pan of his torso. Kennedy slathered him in lotion, went in for a sloppy kiss, and, before passing out drunk, added, \u201cI\u2019m a man.\u201d (This tour de force should come as no surprise; her turn as Little Richard won her Season 7\u2019s Snatch Game.)\n\nThe runway challenge, Wigs on Wigs on Wigs, was inspired by the Season 5 runner-up Roxxxy Andrews\u2019s reveal of a second wig during a lip-sync. The queens scrambled to get ready, gluing down their eyebrows and predicting the bottom three. How fun, with everyone in earshot! Tell me when you\u2019re tired of this, but on the show with the amateur British bakers, if someone has extra time \u2014 say they\u2019ve gotten their bread dough in the proving drawer early, or their 3-D gingerbread story didn\u2019t collapse \u2014 they\u2019ll help other bakers, glaze things, get things from the fridge for them.\n\nOn the runway, BeBe, Shangela and Trixie were safe. In the bottom: Aja, whose three-wigged Kawaii look was the best of the night but didn\u2019t redeem her failed Needy Girl performance; mod-clad Milk, deservedly dragged for her one-note Psycho (if only they\u2019d seen the workroom footage); and Chi Chi, lovely on the runway but overshadowed in the challenge. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Chi Chi tearfully told the judges, admitting the other queens\u2019 skills made her question her worth.\n\n\u201cChi Chi, you\u2019re worth it,\u201d the guest judge and pop-up life coach Constance Zimmer said.\n\nThe top two? BenDeLaCreme, for the third week in a row, and Kennedy, who announced backstage that she would forgo one-on-one appeals and decide who to eliminate on her own terms. BenDeLaCreme still kept office hours, though. Aja stopped by, knowing full well she wasn\u2019t going home \u2014 three wigs.

Not really, but the producers were clearly carving a narrative. Milk, on the other hand, was safe somehow, despite a snoozy-glam runway outing and, in the Divas Live challenge, bearing no resemblance whatsoever to Celine Dion.

The stakes are high and smarts prevail.\n\nTrixie announced she\u2019d be impersonating RuPaul, to a workroom full of stares. \u201cEvery time I do RuPaul in front of people they think it\u2019s hilarious,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m gonna win the challenge.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sound real confident, sis,\u201d Aja said, with a hint of friendly warning.\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d Trixie replied, missing it.\n\nThe real RuPaul entered the workroom, with the designer Marc Jacobs, to walk around and instill doubt. (Jacobs, curiously, was not there for a fashion challenge \u2014 perhaps they were getting lunch and Ru was like, \u201cJust a sec, I have to tape this, come with.\u201d)\n\n\u201cYour accent sounded a little like Ireland,\u201d RuPaul told Shangela, who shelved her plans to be Miss Cleo then and there.\n\nDuring the challenge, BenDeLaCreme killed with an inspired, pitch-perfect Paul Lynde, while Kennedy flopped as Phaedra Parks, of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Atlanta.\u201d (Both won Snatch Game in their respective seasons.) Aja did fine as a salty Crystal LaBeija, from the 1968 pageant documentary \u201cThe Queen,\u201d as did BeBe Zahara Benet, as Grace Jones. Shangela wisely opted for Jenifer Lewis, a personal friend she channeled loud and clear. Chi Chi DeVayne, on the other hand, faltered as Maya Angelou, misspelling Ms. Angelou\u2019s name right out of the gate.\n\nThe guest judge Kristin Chenoweth played as well. \u201cI always thought that one of these queens would do me, and no one ever did, so I decided to come here and do me,\u201d Ms. Chenoweth said, singing a high note, something I worry she does in restaurants.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cSweetheart, none of these queens are gonna do ya,\u201d BenDeLaCreme, as Mr. Lynde, quipped.\n\nAnd Trixie started out with a decent RuPaul impression that probably does get laughs in small doses but couldn\u2019t be sustained. \u201cYou\u2019ve won an uncomfortable phone call to your ex and a half-eaten hot dog from the back of my car,\u201d she interjected after another queen\u2019s answer, and Michelle Visage looked on, frozen, like an aunt at the Olympics whose niece just fell on the ice.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

So was BeBe, luscious in monochromatic dark blossoms. BenDeLaCreme, covered in orchids and shimmering butterflies, was named top two for the fourth week in a row. She was joined by Shangela, done up in a nod to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s floral-wreathed pregnancy announcement photo.\n\nIn the bottom: the inconsistent Kennedy, who was last week\u2019s winner; Chi Chi, lovely in lilies but adrift in the challenge; and a kaleidoscopically effloresced Trixie, who cried while the camera zoomed in.\n\n\u201cI get nervous here,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m at Camp Crystal Lake and Jason\u2019s outside with the machete.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget what you have, and what you offer, and who you are, whether this continues or not,\u201d Ms. Chenoweth said. (\u201cYeah,\u201d the producers of Trixie\u2019s hit Viceland show added, at home.)\n\nBackstage, the top two took meetings. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of you for continuing to plug away at this,\u201d BenDeLaCreme told Chi Chi, sounding a bit like the teacher of that painting class I shouldn\u2019t have taken.\n\nMeanwhile, Aja \u2014 who has calmly consoled so many queens backstage this season \u2014 sat with a vulnerable Trixie. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of drag in the real world,\u201d Trixie said, and I felt for her. She\u2019s gifted, perhaps just not at \u201cDrag Race.\u201d\n\nShangela, on the other hand, was born for this, holding court in yet another confessional. \u201cThis is the \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 of drag,\u201d she said, refusing to let an episode go by without making that comparison. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have alliances. Is Trixie Jon Snow, or is she Cersei Lannister?\u201d (Actually, right now I\u2019d say Trixie\u2019s more Season 3 Edmure Tully, firing arrows at his father\u2019s funeral boat and missing, am I right?)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter a lip-sync to Katy Perry\u2019s not-timeless \u201cI Kissed a Girl,\u201d both Shangela and BenDeLaCreme were crowned winners and, in a twist, each was given the chance to eliminate one of the bottom three queens. BenDeLaCreme eliminated Chi Chi, fine, and Shangela, who really did a supermarket sweep of this episode, milked the moment. \u201cThe person I\u2019ve chosen didn\u2019t leave with the crown, but they made a career,\u201d she said, teasing out what sounded like a Trixie elimination, only to reveal she\u2019d eliminated Chi Chi as well. (Warning shot: fired \u2014 and a sobbing Trixie clearly heard it.)\n\n\u201cThank you guys so much!\u201d Chi Chi said, waving. \u201cI\u2019m sad to go, but I think I did the best that I could,\u201d she added backstage, smiling. \u201c\u2018All Stars 3\u2019 was hard.\u201d\n\nFinally: a gracious exit. God, I love Chi Chi. Does she bake? If she can get to the U.K., and get a consistent layer of jam between two Victoria sponges, there\u2019s a show I\u2019d like to see her on.\n\nWill Shangela get played? Will Trixie finally triumph?

With assigned roles and a series of unscripted scenes, the queens\u2019 acting and improvisation skills were put to the test \u2014 muscles many were eager to flex, except for Chi Chi DeVayne. \u201cI don\u2019t consider myself to be a comedian and an actress and all that,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m getting so intimidated.\u201d\n\nShangela, her partner in the challenge, went full Stella Adler: \u201cHow are you going to play your character? How\u2019s she going to talk, how\u2019s she going to act?\u201d\n\nThe actor Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman, whose smile I\u2019d take a midwinter shuttle bus for, guested as the Bachelor, sitting down with the queens in teamed pairs. BeBe started out strong as the Virgin, a princess direct from Africa who kept kneeling at his feet but ran out of steam fast. Trixie, as the Fake Bitch, wrested a couple moments from Milk, who, as the Psycho Stalker, babbled and shrieked over her. (\u201cDon\u2019t talk over each other,\u201d Michelle Visage had cautioned beforehand.) Chi Chi and Shangela, as a polyamorous lesbian couple, were unspecific and out to sea.

Even funnier was Kennedy\u2019s raunchy Party Girl, who also had trouble getting out of the limo, and hid bottle service in her padding. \u201cWe gonna make a toast to love,\u201d she said as Mr. Bowyer-Chapman disrobed for a massage by the pool, and the camera swooped in for a thirsty \u201cPlanet Earth\u201d pan of his torso. Kennedy slathered him in lotion, went in for a sloppy kiss, and, before passing out drunk, added, \u201cI\u2019m a man.\u201d (This tour de force should come as no surprise; her turn as Little Richard won her Season 7\u2019s Snatch Game.)\n\nThe runway challenge, Wigs on Wigs on Wigs, was inspired by the Season 5 runner-up Roxxxy Andrews\u2019s reveal of a second wig during a lip-sync. The queens scrambled to get ready, gluing down their eyebrows and predicting the bottom three. How fun, with everyone in earshot! Tell me when you\u2019re tired of this, but on the show with the amateur British bakers, if someone has extra time \u2014 say they\u2019ve gotten their bread dough in the proving drawer early, or their 3-D gingerbread story didn\u2019t collapse \u2014 they\u2019ll help other bakers, glaze things, get things from the fridge for them.\n\nOn the runway, BeBe, Shangela and Trixie were safe. In the bottom: Aja, whose three-wigged Kawaii look was the best of the night but didn\u2019t redeem her failed Needy Girl performance; mod-clad Milk, deservedly dragged for her one-note Psycho (if only they\u2019d seen the workroom footage); and Chi Chi, lovely on the runway but overshadowed in the challenge. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Chi Chi tearfully told the judges, admitting the other queens\u2019 skills made her question her worth.\n\n\u201cChi Chi, you\u2019re worth it,\u201d the guest judge and pop-up life coach Constance Zimmer said.\n\nThe top two? BenDeLaCreme, for the third week in a row, and Kennedy, who announced backstage that she would forgo one-on-one appeals and decide who to eliminate on her own terms. BenDeLaCreme still kept office hours, though. Aja stopped by, knowing full well she wasn\u2019t going home \u2014 three wigs. Chi Chi shuffled over resignedly, as did Milk, who whispered, \u201cThe judges actually want me to continue in this.\u201d (What a choice: Chi Chi, a box of puppies, and Milk, a parking ticket.)\n\nA steady, inhabited lip-sync to Lorde\u2019s \u201cGreen Light\u201d won Kennedy the episode, and she eliminated Milk, who proved you can go big and go home.\n\nWill Chi Chi conquer her self-doubt? Will Trixie break out from the pack? Would Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman like to meet a truly needy girl?

The queens were assigned divas to impersonate \u2014 Trixie Mattel got Dolly Parton; Aja, Amy Winehouse; Thorgy Thor, Stevie Nicks \u2014 pairings that felt surprisingly considerate of each queen\u2019s strengths.\n\nThorgy, who admitted Ms. Nicks was one of her biggest inspirations, nevertheless bristled. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be a conspiracy theorist, because that\u2019s what I was in Season 8,\u201d she said, before launching into a conspiracy theory: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m being set up to fail. Next to Diana Ross and Janet Jackson, she is not like, \u2018Werk!\u2019 It just doesn\u2019t feel fair.\u201d\n\nFirst off, Stevie Nicks said on \u201cOprah\u2019s Master Class\u201d that she carried a gram of cocaine in her boot for years, like a Laurel Canyon Mary Poppins; that\u2019s drama. Second, the whole point of \u201cAll Stars\u201d is to exhibit growth where you once fell short, so for the love of God, wait a little longer than Episode 2 before putting on the tinfoil hat.\n\nAssigned Celine Dion, Milk revealed she\u2019d impersonated her once before, to great acclaim from Ms. Dion\u2019s wedding planner, who happened to be in the audience. \u201cHe was like, \u2018Oh my god, that was the best Celine,\u2019\u201d Milk boasted, adding that, for this challenge, she\u2019d decided to replicate a Versace dress and black spiky hair Ms. Dion wore to the most recent Met Gala.\n\n\u201cDo you think anybody\u2019s going to recognize that?\u201d BenDeLaCreme asked.

The queens lip-synced to cloyingly impersonated covers of RuPaul\u2019s greatest hits \u2014 you know VH1 can afford 40 seconds of \u201cNasty,\u201d so this move felt particularly cynical \u2014 followed by a \u201cRudemption\u201d runway, where they spruced up disastrous looks from their previous stints on the show.\n\nIn the top were BenDeLaCreme, who rapped cheekily as Julie Andrews; BeBe Zahara Benet, who nailed Diana Ross; and Shangela, who hammed up Mariah Carey and strutted the runway in a giant, rolling bubble. In the bottom: Kennedy Davenport, who lip-synced messily; Thorgy, who, surprise, didn\u2019t quite commit; and, for reasons unclear to me, Chi Chi, who put across a great Patti LaBelle and wore a shapely runway outfit, after repeated criticism from the Season 8 judges for not wearing padding. (\u201cI just loved you in \u2018Eraser,\u2019\u201d Chi Chi gushed to guest judge Vanessa Williams. \u201c\u2018Eraser,\u2019 baby, \u2018Eraser.\u201d\u201d)\n\nDid Thorgy deserve a bottom spot as well? Not really, but the producers were clearly carving a narrative. Milk, on the other hand, was safe somehow, despite a snoozy-glam runway outing and, in the Divas Live challenge, bearing no resemblance whatsoever to Celine Dion. Backstage, she behaved ru-diculously, crying and cursing, while the others rubbernecked in bemused shock. \u201cI was in character the entire time and to not be commended for it, it\u2019s stupid,\u201d Milk said. \u201cI hate this.\u201d (I mean, they know this is going to be on television, right?)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBenDeLaCreme and Shangela were named top two and faced off in a lip-sync to The Pointer Sisters\u2019 \u201cJump (For My Love).\u201d BenDeLaCreme unzipped to a second look mid-song, but Shangela whipped out a jump rope and victory was hers, as was the task of eliminating either Kennedy or Thorgy, who\u2019d continued to grouse backstage and angle for alliances. No dice: Shangela axed her.\n\n\u201cGross,\u201d Thorgy said. \u201cHave a good time without me,\u201d she added in the workroom, packing up. \u201cBye, it\u2019s going to be boring TV.\u201d\n\nTruly, get out. Also, you know, I hate to be a broken record, but there\u2019s this show with amateur British bakers, and if their meringues curdle it\u2019s no one\u2019s fault but theirs, for not watching them more closely. They acknowledge and internalize this in their confessionals, which are filmed in the nearby meadow. It is not boring TV.\n\nRuPaul popped on the workroom television to, yet again, coo ominous reassurances to Thorgy, while previous winners (and RuPaul handmaids) Chad Michaels and Alaska stalked up behind her.\n\nWhen Thorgy inevitably returns, will she be chastened?
