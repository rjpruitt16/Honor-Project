Thomas D. Waldhauser, did not mention the December battle in testimony to Congress this month and only broadly outlined the threats in the region. A senior House Republican aide said on Wednesday that lawmakers had been notified about the Dec. 6 attack soon after it happened.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis is reviewing the results of a lengthy internal investigation into the October ambush, near the border with Mali, which set off a widespread debate about why American troops are fighting a shadowy war in Niger. A military official said on Wednesday that Mr. Mattis was wrestling with the investigation\u2019s apparent attempts to blame low-level commanders for the deaths of the four soldiers and not implicate senior officers.\n\nThe families of the soldiers \u2014 Staff Sgt. Bryan C. Black, Staff Sgt. Dustin M. Wright, Staff Sgt. Jeremiah W. Johnson and Sgt. La David Johnson \u2014 have not been told of the investigation\u2019s conclusions, said the military official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the findings have not yet been released.\n\nThe Pentagon appears ready to scale back military operations in West Africa even further. A draft of the investigation, parts of which were described to The Times in February, called for the military to reduce the number of ground missions, and to strip commanders in the field of some authority to send troops on potentially high-risk patrols.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2017, there were about 10 instances of American troops and local training partners being attacked in Niger and elsewhere in West Africa, said Brig. Gen. Donald C. Bolduc, the former commander of United States Special Operations in Africa.\n\nEnemy fighters were killed in some of those unreported episodes, General Bolduc said on Wednesday, but there were no American casualties.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe existence of the Dec. 6 firefight was referenced in a terse line in an unclassified report the Trump administration gave to Congress this week about its legal and policy views on using military force. That report, obtained by The Times, mentioned only that a joint American-Nigerien force was attacked by a group of presumed Islamic State militants on that date, and returned fire \u201cin self-defense.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Reho portrayed the firefight as an act of self-defense after the unit happened to come under attack.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the mission was to set the conditions for future partner-led operations against violent extremist organizations in the region,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was no aspect of this mission focused on pursuing enemy militants, and the combined force was postured to respond as necessary in case contact with the enemy occurred.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWith that said, our forces do operate in unstable areas and are occasionally exposed to danger from enemy forces. When such a situation occurs, our personnel are authorized to respond to threats and violence appropriately.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It sought to clear the potentially hostile area so that Nigerien forces could build a new outpost there. It is unclear if the small base was ever built.\n\nThe mission had attracted attention among American forces after the firefight, the official said, because it was one of the first major forays into the field in Niger since the Oct. 4 ambush.\n\nThe White House only this month approved giving combat pay to American troops deployed to Niger. Army soldiers in Niger are still not eligible for certain combat awards \u2014 including the Combat Infantry Badge and Combat Action Badge \u2014 that are highly respected and sometimes can help with promotion. The four soldiers who were killed in the Oct. 4 raid were given the awards posthumously, but those troops who have fought in Niger have not received them.\n\nQuestions about whether the American military, under the Trump administration, is seeking to obscure the expanding scope of operations in Africa were raised last week when it was revealed that the United States carried out four airstrikes in Libya between September and January that Africa Command failed to disclose at the time. The military has said it will acknowledge such missions if asked about them, even if it does not affirmatively disclose them in a news release.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Dec. 6 firefight was the main nugget of new information in the report that the Trump administration submitted to Congress this week, and was eagerly awaited by specialists on national security issues related to counterterrorism operations.\n\nThey hoped it would offer a thorough public explanation of issues \u2014 ranging from when the Trump administration thinks it can attack other countries without prior permission from Congress, to an acknowledgment that President Trump secretly relaxed limits on when the military or the Central Intelligence Agency can carry out kill-or-capture operations with drones or commando teams, away from conventional battlefields.\n\nBut the unclassified portion of the report, which was just over eight pages long, largely consisted of a slightly rewritten version of last December\u2019s version of the semiannual War Powers Resolution letter in which the executive branch lists deployments abroad.\n\nThe unclassified report gave only terse descriptions of certain matters while making no mention of key topics like Mr. Trump\u2019s changes to the drone strike rules, suggesting that they were relegated to the classified annex the public cannot see.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to see this administration show disrespect for Congress\u2019s effort to obtain public answers to key legal questions of our time,\u201d said Joshua Geltzer, a former senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council in the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cThis report was an opportunity to inform discussion on the Hill and, perhaps even more important, across the country on critical questions about when and why our country can take the grave step of using military force.

Pak, a former C.I.A. analyst who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Center for East Asia Policy Studies, said in an essay posted on the Brookings website.\n\nEven if the South Koreans faithfully relayed Mr. Kim\u2019s offer, the muddled aftermath of Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise announcement illustrates how little control he has over the momentum behind the diplomatic opening. The leaders of North and South Korea are scheduled to meet at the end of April, setting the stage for the Trump-Kim summit meeting a month later.\n\n\u201cThe president, and now Pompeo with him, are flowing into an initiative that has been driven by the Koreans,\u201d said Philip D. Zelikow, who served in the State Department during the George W. Bush administration. \u201cA lot of the key spadework on this is going to unfold before Pompeo is on the job.\u201d\n\nMr. Zelikow, who has been involved in back-channel negotiations with North Korean representatives over the years, said that they have seized the strategic initiative for the meeting, which would give them an advantage in setting the time, place and agenda for the encounter.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to delay and defuse the danger of a war,\u201d Mr. Zelikow said. \u201cThe best-case scenario is that there would be some agreement on principles that would guide future negotiations.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, traveled to New York on Monday to brief members of the United Nations Security Council about the president\u2019s decision to meet with Mr. Kim. General McMaster said the invitation vindicated the president\u2019s strategy of imposing \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on the North.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Matthew Pottinger, the National Security Council\u2019s senior director for Asia, offered the diplomats a litany of reasons previous negotiations with North Korea had failed.\n\nTwo obvious candidates to consult on talks are no longer available to the White House: Joseph Y. Yun, a Korean-born American diplomat who negotiated with Pyongyang for the return of a detained American, Otto F. Warmbier, resigned from the Foreign Service. Victor D. Cha, a Korea expert in the Bush administration, was on track to be ambassador to Seoul before the White House pulled the plug on his nomination.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven inside the White House, some officials express regret that Mr. Cha was blocked. Among those now under consideration for the post, according to a person briefed by the White House, are two retired generals who commanded troops in South Korea: Walter L. Sharp and James D. Thurman.\n\nWith no ambassador in place and the State Department in flux, Mr. Pottinger and his staff are handling much of the preparations for the meeting. But the National Security Council is itself on edge, amid persistent rumors that General McMaster might soon depart.\n\nEven in a hawkish administration, Mr. Pompeo\u2019s statements about North Korea have been hard-line. Last summer, speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, he came as close as any official in calling for the removal of Mr. Kim.\n\n\u201cThe thing that is the most dangerous about it is the character who holds the control over\u201d North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal, Mr. Pompeo said.\n\n\u201cFrom the administration\u2019s perspective, the most important thing we can do is separate those two. Right?\u201d he continued. \u201cSeparate capacity and someone who might well have intent, and break those two apart.\u201d\n\nMr. Pompeo\u2019s C.I.A. background could help him assess the authenticity of the North Korean offer. But with no diplomatic experience, he will not be able to offer Mr. Trump much advice on how to handle Mr. Kim or how to approach a complex negotiation.\n\nGiven all those limitations, said Jeffrey A. Bader, a former Asia adviser to President Barack Obama, Mr. Trump should consider appointing a special negotiator to take charge after his initial meeting with Mr. Kim.\n\n\u201cThey got two months to pull this together,\u201d Mr. Bader said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have language from the horse\u2019s mouth on North Korea\u2019s offer, don\u2019t have clarity on a plausible U.S. objective, don\u2019t have a venue, don\u2019t have a date \u2014 and they\u2019ve got no experienced negotiator.\u201d", "keywords": ["changes", "meeting", "security", "offer", "kim", "house", "zelikow", "korea", "planning", "jongun", "north", "dont", "cabinet", "white", "delay", "mr"], "polarity": 0.04363790970933828, "subjectivity": 0.3433783903171658},

The 18th Congressional District runs from the rural southwest corner of the state, a blue-collar wedge of gas fields and coal mines, up to the middle- and upper-class Pittsburgh suburbs, a mix of dependably Democratic communities and Republican strongholds.\n\nMany political experts had focused on whether Mr. Lamb could keep the vote close in rural areas, something he accomplished with a strong pitch to labor unions. But the scale of his margins in some suburbs was what surprised many, and likely pushed him over the top. Voters in the suburbs have also helped Democrats in other recent races, particularly in Alabama, where the Democrat, Doug Jones, beat the Republican favorite, Roy Moore.\n\nMr. Trump easily won Bethel Park in 2016; four years earlier, Mitt Romney racked up a 24-point win in Upper St. Clair, the affluent township next door. On Tuesday, Mr. Lamb, whose campaign signs dot the manicured lawns, won both by 10 points.\n\nMike DeVanney, a Republican political consultant in Pittsburgh, saw several things at work in Mr. Lamb\u2019s campaign, all of which are warning signs for Republicans in the midterm races in November. For many, he said, this was \u201cthe first opportunity to voice an opinion on Donald Trump,\u201d and that opinion, at least among the most motivated, was not favorable.\n\nBut it also showed the value of picking candidates \u2014 in Mr. Saccone, 60, a social conservative who was not the natural choice for many suburban Republicans, and in Mr. Lamb, a telegenic 33-year-old former Marine.\n\n\u201cYou have to give credit,\u201d Mr. DeVanney said. \u201cHe was clearly the best candidate they\u2019ve run for this district. And not only the best candidate but he executed a strong campaign.\u201d\n\nSome residents, even those who considered themselves Trump supporters, thought that most voters on Tuesday were only considering their disapproval of the president. The candidates themselves were more or less irrelevant.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cLightweights, the both of them,\u201d said Gary Berman, 75, a retired engineer sitting in the food court of the upscale South Hills Village shopping mall.

They did not deny the energized antipathy toward Mr. Trump, which arguably made this campaign competitive in the first place. But in such a tight race, there are still factors the candidates control that can sway the outcome.\n\nSamuel DeMarco, a Republican who sits on the Allegheny County Council, kept returning to what he saw as Mr. Saccone\u2019s missteps \u2014 poor fund-raising, missed events, the lack of a clear vision \u2014 particularly in contrast to the adroitness of Mr. Lamb.\n\nMr. DeMarco saw little campaigning by Mr. Saccone on the two policy matters he could have championed \u2014 the tax plan that the Republicans passed in December and the planned steel tariffs \u2014 and instead saw a pitch that boiled down to little more than his support of Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Saccone campaign ever gave the public a compelling reason to vote for him,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a Saccone thing when it comes to Republicans. It\u2019s a Trump thing when it comes to Democrats.\u201d\n\nStill, the distinction is not always so clear. For Janet Supko, 63, a retired schoolteacher who voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, the election was all about the president.\n\n\u201cThere have got to be some changes made,\u201d said Ms. Supko, who had just rounded the corner of Macy\u2019s in her morning walk at South Hills Village. While she had benefited from the Republican\u2019s income tax overhaul, she lamented the president\u2019s \u201clack of professionalism,\u201d the numerous hirings and firings, and the general sense of chaos in the White House.\n\nMr. Lamb was young and fresh and new; maybe he represented the change she had been hoping for when she voted for Mr. Trump in the first place.\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d she said, \u201cyou just have to try something else.\u201d\n\nHer walking partner, Clare Rex, 68, was never a fan of Mr. Trump, but for her, in the end, the election was about Mr. Lamb.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI saw him at the fish fry at Our Lady of Grace,\u201d she said. \u201cHe just seems to bring a fresh perspective.\u201d\n\nThe women came to the end of their walk at the Starbucks, where they met two friends, both Republicans, both Trump supporters, and neither surprised by what happened on Tuesday. Whether it was because of the Lamb campaign\u2019s savvy or anti-Trump energy on the Democratic side, they said, the win for Mr. Lamb, even here in a place that had not voted Democrat in years, seemed inevitable.\n\nOver the weekend, Christine Sorbara, 72, had gone to President Trump\u2019s rally in an airplane hangar in support of Mr. Saccone. She thought it probably helped him some.

A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to say whether Mr. McCabe would be fired.\n\n\u201cThe department follows a prescribed process by which an employee may be terminated,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Sarah Isgur Flores. \u201cThat process includes recommendations from career employees, and no termination decision is final until the conclusion of that process. We have no personnel announcements at this time.\u201d\n\nMr. McCabe declined to comment. His friends and allies have said that he denies any wrongdoing in his dealings with journalists or the inspector general. He stepped down in January and took a leave of absence under pressure over the looming inspector general\u2019s report.\n\nMr. McCabe is a career agent, not a political appointee, so Mr. Trump has no direct say in his fate. The decision nonetheless comes at a moment of turnover in Mr. Trump\u2019s national security team. On Tuesday, the president fired the secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, and named the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, to replace him. He tapped a veteran clandestine officer, Gina Haspel, to lead the C.I.A.\n\nFiring Mr. McCabe, even on the recommendation of the disciplinary office, would be controversial. Among Mr. McCabe\u2019s allies, the decision would raise the specter that Mr. Sessions was influenced by Mr. Trump\u2019s frequent derisive comments. No deputy director in the history of the F.B.I. has been fired.\n\nBut Mr. Sessions would be able to point to a critical inspector general\u2019s report and say he followed Justice Department protocol. The details of why the inspector general viewed Mr. McCabe as not forthcoming are not clear. Though F.B.I. disciplinary records show that drunken driving, domestic violence and assaults have been punished by suspension, when agents are found to have shown a lack of candor under oath, they are commonly fired.\n\nThe inspector general, Michael Horowitz, announced last year that he would investigate several contentious decisions made at the F.B.I. and Justice Department during the 2016 presidential campaign. In November, Mr. Horowitz indicated that he planned to issue a single report this spring encompassing his entire review, on matters including the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It is not clear why he opted to handle Mr. McCabe separately and refer him for discipline before the release of the full report. A spokesman for Mr. Horowitz has declined to comment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump has attacked members of the F.B.I. and the Justice Department for much of his first year in office. But few have been the target of presidential ire like Mr. McCabe. Mr. Trump has repeatedly remarked on the fact that Mr. McCabe\u2019s wife, Jill, ran as a Democrat for a State Senate seat in Virginia. Her campaign received hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from a political committee run by Terry McAuliffe, the Virginia governor at the time and a longtime ally of the Clintons.\n\nMrs. McCabe lost the race and Mr. McCabe was later promoted to deputy director, where he oversaw the investigation into Mrs. Clinton. No charges were filed in that case, and Mr. Trump has pointed to the donations to Mr. McCabe\u2019s wife\u2019s campaign as evidence of F.B.I. bias.\n\nIn meetings with Mr. McCabe, the president questioned how he had voted and needled him about his wife, calling her a \u201closer,\u201d according to people familiar with the conversations.\n\nThe precise allegations against Mr. McCabe will not be clear until the full report is released. But what is publicly known does not fit neatly into Mr. Trump\u2019s theory of Mr. McCabe as a Democratic operator. Mr. McCabe has described himself to friends as a lifelong Republican voter.\n\nThe allegations revolve around disclosures to The Wall Street Journal, which revealed in October 2016 a dispute between the F.B.I. and Justice Department over how to proceed in an investigation into the Clinton family\u2019s foundation. The article said that the Justice Department would not authorize subpoenas in the case. Some F.B.I. agents, the article said, believed that Mr. McCabe had put the brakes on the investigation. Others rejected that notion.\n\nThe inspector general has concluded that Mr. McCabe authorized F.B.I. officials to provide information for that article. The public affairs office arranged a phone call to discuss the case, a common practice in the federal government when officials believe that a journalist has only part of the story.\n\nIn the Journal story, a person described as close to Mr. McCabe pushed back on the notion that he had tried to shut down the Clinton Foundation investigation. To the contrary, the person described a tense conversation with the Justice Department in which Mr. McCabe insisted his agents had the authority to keep investigating.\n\nThe article was a negative one for the Clinton campaign \u2014 not Mr. Trump. It was published just days before the election, after the F.B.I. reopened its investigation into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email practices. The article, including the F.B.I. disclosures, made it clear that some agents saw evidence of wrongdoing by the Clinton Foundation that was worth investigating.\n\nMr. McCabe joined the F.B.I. after law school and rose quickly through the ranks. Under the former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, he ascended through several senior leadership jobs, and it was clear that he was being groomed for the bureau\u2019s No. 2 position. His rise angered some rank-and-file agents. But supporters viewed him as a sophisticated, intellectual choice for a job that has become an integral part of the nation\u2019s intelligence community.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe deputy director is the chief operations officer at the F.B.I., a job that requires managing relationships with the White House and Congress.

W. Tillerson arriving in Djibouti on Friday, four days before he was fired. Some senior administration officials said Mr. Tillerson should have anticipated his ouster. Credit Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nAt a refueling stop in Cape Verde on his way home from an exhausting visit across Africa, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson walked through howling winds late Monday night toward the airport\u2019s V.I.P. terminal, where he pulled up a chair and started telling jokes to the reporters who had traveled with him.\n\nHe was fired by executive tweet just hours later.\n\nBy the time Mr. Tillerson again spoke to reporters, on Tuesday afternoon in Washington, the man who had strode confidently and relaxed throughout the weeklong diplomatic trip was replaced by a humbled and emotional one who nearly choked up as he announced that he would be handing off his powers at the stroke of midnight.\n\nSome senior administration officials said Mr. Tillerson \u2014 who in nearly 14 months at the State Department had departed from President Trump\u2019s policies on the Paris climate accord, the Iran nuclear deal and diplomacy with North Korea \u2014 should have seen it coming.\n\nImage Mr. Tillerson leaving Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on Friday. His tenure was punctuated by inopportune comments, bureaucratic inertia as well as frequent and public disagreements with the president. Credit Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nO fficials said John F. Kelly, the president\u2019s chief of staff, urged Mr. Tillerson late last week to cut short his trip, warning vaguely that he should be on the lookout for an unspecified Twitter post. But State Department officials insisted that had Mr. Kelly intended to relay an ominous message, Mr. Tillerson did not receive it.\n\nThat Mr. Tillerson missed such an important signal coming from the White House was emblematic of a tenure punctuated by inopportune comments, bureaucratic inertia and frequent and public disagreements with Mr. Trump.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Tillerson was often uncomfortable navigating the choppy and turgid waters of the Washington political scene. His favorite part of the job was meeting foreign leaders, as he did last week in what was intended to be a good-will tour to mend fences after Mr. Trump\u2019s vulgar justification in January for trying to block some Africans from immigrating to the United States.\n\nHis first stop on the five-nation trip was Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to visit the headquarters of the African Union. At a news conference, Mr. Tillerson was confronted by local reporters about Mr. Trump\u2019s coarse description of African countries. Gamely, Mr. Tillerson parried the questions \u2014 just as he had done this year in Latin America and Europe, where his reception had been similarly frosty.\n\nImage While in Addis Ababa, Mr. Tillerson seemed to delight in participating in a traditional Ethiopian coffee ceremony. Credit Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nHe seemed far more comfortable a few hours later, at a coffee ceremony on the grounds of the American Embassy. At times distant and intensely shy, Mr. Tillerson could often also be quite gracious, and took obvious delight when a colorfully dressed Ethiopian woman sat over a small fire and roasted coffee beans, flowers strewn about her. He gladly accepted a small white china cup filled with black liquid and drank it back.\n\nA turning point came several hours later. In a phone call around 2:30 a.m., he first learned that Mr. Trump had agreed to negotiate directly with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader \u2014 a diplomatic warming that Mr. Tillerson had offered in September to undertake, only to be publicly rebuffed by the president. The reversal began an important part of the trip for Mr. Tillerson: gaming out how such a meeting could be brought off successfully.\n\nIn repeated conversations throughout Africa with aides and reporters, Mr. Tillerson said his years as chief executive of Exxon Mobil taught him valuable lessons about how to handle such delicate conversations. His comments made clear that he expected to be deeply involved, for weeks if not months, in negotiations over how the talks with Mr. Kim would proceed.\n\nImage Mr. Tillerson arriving on Sunday to tour the Kenya Wildlife Service in Nairobi, Kenya. He seemed to delight in animals and the natural world. Credit Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nFrom Ethiopia, Mr. Tillerson flew to Djibouti and then Kenya, where he seemed in obvious physical distress during a news conference in Nairobi with Monica Juma, the country\u2019s cabinet secretary for foreign affairs. His aides later said that Mr. Tillerson was suffering from food poisoning after eating a piece of salmon in Ethiopia, and few on his staff were surprised when he canceled a planned trip to an H.I.V./AIDS clinic.\n\nBut he rallied the next day, on Sunday, to visit a Nairobi park that serves as a memorial to the more than 200 victims who were killed in a truck bombing against the American Embassy in Kenya on Aug. 7, 1998.\n\nFighting terror and protecting the physical safety of State Department employees were among the most consistent themes that Mr. Tillerson struck throughout his time as secretary, and the service in Nairobi allowed him to speak about both in the kind of somber tones that he favored.\n\n\u201cAs all of you well know, in 1998, terrorists thought they could demoralize and destroy the Kenyan and American people by attacking the U.S. Embassy here in Nairobi,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said. \u201cOf course, they were wrong. Nearly 20 years later, we meet here to honor those who we lost and those who were injured.\u201d\n\nImage Mr. Tillerson also paid homage on Sunday to the victims of the 1998 bombing against the American Embassy in Nairobi. Credit Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nHe also seemed to delight in animals and the natural world, and soon after his remarks, Mr. Tillerson headed to Nairobi National Park. A quick tour of a lab was followed by a private safari, the sort of fun that he had increasingly tried to inject into his travel schedule.\n\nBut with Washington roiled by news of the impending meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, Mr. Tillerson decided on Monday to compress his visits to Chad and Nigeria into one long day, then return home.\n\nIn a rare interview with reporters aboard his government plane as it flew west into the sunset, Mr. Tillerson was intent on impressing just how important such meetings with world leaders are.\n\n\u201cThis is what diplomacy looks like, O.K.?\u201d Mr. Tillerson said.\n\nThe plane landed before dawn on Tuesday at an Air Force base outside the capital.

Its shares have soared, and last year it posted record earnings and cash flow. Much of that money was made abroad, though, and a counterattack aimed at Boeing could reverberate into the farthest reaches of the nation\u2019s industrial economy.\n\nThe company employs 137,000 people in the United States, nearly as many workers as the entire primary steel and aluminum industries. Many more work at its suppliers, from Kansas to Pennsylvania, and those employees would also be at risk of a gut punch if China and other countries chose to make an example of Boeing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really worried about what it\u2019s going to do to us,\u201d said James Springer, a mechanic who installs stow bins and class dividers on 787 Dreamliners at Boeing\u2019s plant in North Charleston, S.C. \u201cWhat will the E.U. and China do, especially China? They are one of our biggest customers now.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBut China, too, depends on Boeing, and damage inflicted on the company would not be painless. China has a seemingly insatiable need for new aircraft, and can\u2019t yet make them domestically. Boeing is also set to open a finishing plant near Shanghai this year, so the Chinese government may put quality jobs at risk if it were to cut the company off.\n\n\u201cIf China decides to retaliate, it hurts their airlines and their burgeoning aerospace industry,\u201d said Scott Hamilton, the managing director at the Leeham Company, an aviation consulting firm in Bainbridge Island, Wash. \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d\n\nBut if China wanted to exact revenge on the United States through Boeing, it would be uniquely positioned to do so. The government has a significant stake in its national airlines and can easily direct them to cancel orders. About a quarter of Boeing\u2019s jetliners went to China last year, and analysts estimate that Chinese orders could account for up to a fifth of its backlog.\n\nUntil now, Mr. Trump has been a puzzle that Boeing mostly seemed to have figured out.\n\nThe president began the relationship even before his inauguration by proclaiming his displeasure at the cost of the next-generation Air Force One that Boeing is building. \u201cCosts are out of control, more than $4 billion,\u201d he declared on Twitter. \u201cCancel order!\u201d\n\nHe later told reporters that Boeing was \u201cdoing a little bit of a number,\u201d and said, \u201cWe want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTwo weeks later, Dennis A. Muilenburg, Boeing\u2019s chief executive, visited Mr. Trump in Florida and promised to keep the plane\u2019s cost down. \u201cIt was a terrific conversation,\u201d Mr. Muilenburg said afterward. \u201cGot a lot of respect for him. He\u2019s a good man. And he\u2019s doing the right thing.\u201d\n\nTwo months later, the president visited Boeing\u2019s South Carolina plant and, standing before a 787 Dreamliner, proclaimed, \u201cGod bless Boeing.\u201d\n\nWhile campaigning, Mr. Trump had repeatedly criticized the Export-Import Bank, which lends so much money to the company\u2019s customers that it has been referred to as \u201cBoeing\u2019s Bank.\u201d But in his first year as president, Mr. Trump decided to keep the bank alive.\n\nMr. Muilenburg has praised the president for the corporate tax cut, calling it \u201cthe biggest thing we could do in this country to unleash economic energy.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe past year and a half has indeed been good to Boeing. Its share price went up by 90 percent in 2017, making it the best performer in the Dow Jones industrial average. It has performed spectacularly so far this year.\n\nAt the end of February, the company cheerily announced that it had arrived at an agreement with Mr. Trump for an Air Force One with a new, lower price tag. \u201cPresident Trump negotiated a good deal on behalf of the American people,\u201d the company declared on Twitter. Two days later, Mr. Trump said he would pursue steep tariffs on steel and aluminum.\n\n\u201cThey found themselves bullied,\u201d Mr. Aboulafia said of Boeing. \u201cThey very intelligently did the smart thing and befriended the bully, and I think they are starting to find out that being friends with the bully is just as hard as being the victim of the bully.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe tariffs alone were never going to cost Boeing very much. It doesn\u2019t use a lot of steel, and the aluminum that encloses the body of its planes amounts to pocket change relative to an engine or the electronics system. The aircraft maker also has flexible, long-term contracts that often allow it to pass on some unanticipated cost increases to its customers, analysts said. Aluminum prices went up by more than 10 percent last year, and no one along the supply chain appeared to flinch.\n\nThe real risk is that China will lash out, and it\u2019s difficult to say how likely that could be. Boeing and its only real rival on that front, the European company Airbus, have backlogs that stretch into the next decade.\n\nA Chinese aerospace company, Comac, flew its first Boeing-sized jet in China in 2016, but it is years away from producing them. That may make it more attractive to punish a different American brand that makes something the Chinese can easily find elsewhere.\n\nOn the other hand, the Chinese government may have more leverage over Airbus than it seems. China is expected to surpass the United States to become the world\u2019s biggest aviation market by 2022, according to the International Air Transport Association. That growing dominance could help the government lean on Airbus to ramp up production to fill a potential hole left by Boeing, aerospace consultants said.\n\nA more moderate option for the Chinese would be to keep current orders on the books, but stop purchasing new Boeing aircraft. That could make for a less intense, but more drawn-out, period of pain for the manufacturer.\n\nIf it loses significant ground in China, analysts said, Boeing would eventually slow production and fire some of its mechanics. That could cripple the companies that make its airplane wings, noses, nuts and bolts.\n\n\u201cThere is this rippling effect where Boeing lays off people, and then the suppliers lay off people,\u201d said Rajeev Lalwani, a Morgan Stanley analyst. \u201cThat protectionism is in a way coming back to hurt the U.S.\u201d", "keywords": ["cost", "company", "tariffs", "trumps", "president", "war", "later", "china", "chinese", "boeing", "trump", "trade", "target", "mr", "boeings"], "polarity": 0.1488462582817421, "subjectivity": 0.3957824015888533},

He said he disagreed with Mr. Tillerson on the Iran nuclear deal and on other issues.\n\n\u201cIt was a different mind-set,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nTheir lack of rapport was evident in the peremptory way the president fired him. Mr. Tillerson learned of it on Tuesday morning when an aide showed him a Twitter post from Mr. Trump announcing the change. But he had gotten a warning last Friday when the chief of staff, John F. Kelly, called to tell him to cut short a trip to Africa and added, \u201cYou may get a tweet.\u201d\n\nIt was an abrupt end after months of speculation \u2014 to a star-crossed tenure for a Texas oil baron who never adapted to the power dynamics of Mr. Trump\u2019s world, or to the president\u2019s worldview. Mr. Tillerson clashed with the White House staff and broke with Mr. Trump on a range of issues, including the dispute between Saudi Arabia and Qatar and the American response to Russia\u2019s cyberaggression.\n\nHowever sudden his departure, Mr. Tillerson\u2019s future had seemed tenuous since reports last October that he called Mr. Trump a \u201cmoron\u201d in a meeting with colleagues at the Pentagon. Mr. Trump, aides said, never forgave him.\n\nMr. Tillerson had a hectic schedule of meetings set for Tuesday afternoon. Instead, after a brief phone call with Mr. Trump, he appeared in the State Department briefing room at 2 p.m. to confirm he would hand over his duties to his deputy at midnight.\n\n\u201cWhat is most important,\u201d he said, his voice thick with emotion, \u201cis to ensure an orderly and smooth transition during a time that the country continues to face significant policy and national security challenges.\u201d\n\nIn Mr. Pompeo, the president will have a hawkish secretary of state, who is more skeptical of diplomatic engagement with North Korea, just as Mr. Trump is preparing to meet the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and is far readier to rip up the Iran nuclear deal, two months before Mr. Trump faces his next deadline to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Tehran.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs Mr. Pompeo\u2019s replacement at the C.I.A., Mr. Trump named the current deputy director, Gina Haspel. A respected career official, she would be the first woman to lead the agency. But Ms. Haspel also oversaw a secret C.I.A. prison in Thailand when a terrorism suspect was waterboarded there and she later drafted a cable ordering the destruction of videotapes documenting brutal interrogations \u2014 both of which could complicate her Senate confirmation.\n\nAt the Department of Veterans Affairs, Mr. Trump has grown impatient with Mr. Shulkin, a politically moderate former hospital executive who served in the Obama administration. He recently sounded out Rick Perry, the current energy secretary, about taking over the department, according to two people close to the White House.\n\nFor Mr. Cohn\u2019s successor, the president said he was seriously considering Larry Kudlow, a Reagan administration official who is now a conservative commentator on CNBC. While Mr. Trump acknowledged differences with him on trade policy, he said Mr. Kudlow had come around to the argument that tariffs were an effective tool in negotiating trade deals.\n\nBesides, he added, \u201cLarry has been a friend of mine for a long time. He backed me very early in the campaign.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

One aide said he decided to replace Mr. Tillerson now to have a new team in place before the talks with Mr. Kim, which are scheduled to happen by May. But Mr. Tillerson was the most persistent advocate of opening talks with North Korea.\n\nThe White House\u2019s purge extended to Mr. Tillerson\u2019s staff. The under secretary of state for public affairs, Steve Goldstein, was fired after he issued a statement that seemed to contradict the White House. Mr. Tillerson\u2019s chief of staff, Margaret Peterlin, and his deputy chief of staff, Christine Ciccone, were also expected to depart.\n\nThat followed the early-morning dismissal of Mr. Trump\u2019s aide, John McEntee, who had his security clearance revoked and was escorted from the White House grounds.\n\nA former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, Mr. Tillerson had once been viewed as an intriguing, if unorthodox, cabinet choice. He had deep experience with Middle Eastern potentates, and knew President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia through Exxon\u2019s extensive efforts to explore for oil in Russia.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Mr. Tillerson\u2019s determination to bring a business sensibility to the State Department backfired, leaving it demoralized and understaffed. Despite his global experience, Mr. Tillerson was ill suited to the public duties of the United States\u2019 chief diplomat and was isolated from the career officials whom he often froze out of the most important policy debates.\n\n\u201cThe State Department clearly has not been built into the kind of global organization that one would prefer,\u201d Henry A. Kissinger, a former secretary of state, said in a telephone interview.\n\nMr. Kissinger said Mr. Pompeo\u2019s political skills would make him a better choice for the job. \u201cI have confidence that Pompeo understands this and will do it because I think he understands the political linkages better,\u201d he said.\n\nAlong with Mr. Kelly and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Mr. Tillerson had functioned as part of a triumvirate that was viewed as a brake on Mr. Trump. Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, once referred to them as \u201cthose people that help separate our country from chaos.\u201d\n\nMr. Tillerson was close to Mr. Mattis, meeting him regularly for breakfast. The defense secretary, who is traveling in Afghanistan, was not informed beforehand that Mr. Tillerson was being fired, according to an administration official. While Mr. Kelly was an early ally of Mr. Tillerson\u2019s, officials said he cooled on him because of his repeated clashes with the White House.\n\nMr. Tillerson had a rancorous relationship with both General McMaster and Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser. He resented that Mr. Trump had entrusted Mr. Kushner, a 37-year-old diplomatic neophyte, with the Middle East peace portfolio and trade negotiations with Mexico, according to people in the White House.\n\nWhen the National Security Council tried to send officials on Mr. Tillerson\u2019s trips, an official said, he either objected or excluded them from key meetings. And when the president named his daughter Ivanka Trump to lead a delegation to India, Mr. Tillerson downgraded the status of the State Department officials who accompanied her \u2014 irritating the president.\n\nBut his policy disagreements with the president appeared to be his undoing: Mr. Tillerson wanted to remain in the Paris climate accord; Mr. Trump decided to leave it. Mr. Tillerson supported preserving the Iran nuclear deal; Mr. Trump loathed the deal as \u201can embarrassment to the United States.\u201d And Mr. Tillerson called for dialogue to resolve the North Korean nuclear crisis, while Mr. Trump threatened a military strike.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Tillerson also broke with Mr. Trump in the bitter dispute between Saudi Arabia and Qatar \u2014 a decision that cost him with Persian Gulf leaders. The leaders, several of whom are visiting Washington in coming weeks, lobbied the White House to replace Mr. Tillerson with Mr. Pompeo.\n\nAt times, White House officials said, Mr. Tillerson\u2019s behavior verged on insubordination. The administration, for example, was extremely cautious in responding to reports that Russia was behind the deadly nerve-gas attack in Britain. But when Mr. Tillerson was asked about it in Africa, he said, \u201cIt appears that it clearly came from Russia.\u201d\n\nHis statement infuriated the White House, which had crafted its talking points with lawyers at the State Department to keep the United States in lock step with Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain. Instead, an official said, Mr. Tillerson made the White House look like it was soft on Mr. Putin, which he insisted was not the intention.\n\nMr. Tillerson\u2019s relations inside the State Department were scarcely better. The department\u2019s policymaking process devolved into conversations between Mr. Tillerson and a lone aide, Brian H. Hook, neither of whom had much experience with the countries they discussed.\n\n\u201cThe relationship between top management and the bulk of the State Department was toxic,\u201d said Ambassador James F. Jeffrey, a former senior diplomat. \u201cAnd that was a total mystery because the people at the State Department would work for the devil if he is advancing American interests, which Mr. Tillerson was.\u201d", "keywords": ["turns", "president", "white", "department", "house", "secretary", "tillersons", "loyalists", "mr", "pompeo", "america", "trump", "state", "reflect", "replacing", "tillerson", "views"], "polarity": 0.038853019995877126, "subjectivity": 0.36200306043163183},

His supporters assembled at an industrial park off in the distance.\n\nThe separation was by design: Organizers from each side said they wanted to stay apart and avoid clashes.

Among the opposition, the talk centered on families separated or desperate migrants dying trying to reach the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt was a day for the bullhorn and the podium, but not for mass protests, as immigrant rights activists, faith-based groups, union organizers and clergymen used the visit to hone their messages before the midterm elections.\n\nAt the anti-Trump church gathering, Representative Juan C. Vargas, a Democrat whose district includes part of San Diego, delivered a passionate rebuke of the president. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have immigrants, he wouldn\u2019t have wives!\u201d he said. He added, \u201cWe have to resist and we have to let him know that California doesn\u2019t welcome him.\u201d\n\nNeal Jos\u00e9 Wilkinson, a pastor in San Diego, made a plea for civil disobedience. Saying that Jesus was killed because he broke the rules, Mr. Wilkinson declared, \u201cThere\u2019s a higher authority then you Donald Trump!\u201d\n\nThere were softer appeals, as well. \u201cI ask you to keep building bridges of love, of kindness to other people,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Castillo, the pastor of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel, the Catholic church where the rally was held.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s welcome committee of a few hundred people, many dressed in the flag, gathered for what was part pep rally and part celebration of what they viewed as the fulfillment of a campaign promise: the construction of a wall to keep undocumented Mexican immigrants away. To a scratchy rendition of Lee Greenwood\u2019s \u201cGod Bless the U.S.A.,\u201d mixed with clips of Mr. Trump\u2019s acceptance speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention, supporters cast themselves as \u201cdeplorables\u201d and enthusiastic gun owners, and hoped for a glimpse of the president\u2019s motorcade.\n\n\u201cHe said secure the borders, build the wall, everything,\u201d said Julie Horn, explaining her support. Her husband, Scott, a retired construction worker, echoed her views. \u201cI think he\u2019s done great,\u201d he said.

Kathy Robinson, who is African-American and from Burbank, and who works as a wedding photographer and Uber driver, voted in 2016 for Hillary Clinton. But after the election, she said she regretted that, and had come to view undocumented immigrants as a menace who take jobs away from American citizens. \u201cTrump is not racist,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s just against illegal immigrants. He loves black people.\u201d\n\nLater in the day, Mr. Trump addressed a hangar full of enthusiastic military service members at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar before attending a fund-raiser expected to raise $5 million at the home of Edward Glazer, a chairman of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump has stayed away from California until now, realizing that the state is beyond his reach in 2020 if he runs for re-election, as he says he will.

The border section he visited is currently guarded by a wire fence and sheet metal barrier, which local border patrol agents said have cut down on crossings since they were first put up. Mr. Trump argued that they need to be replaced by something more permanent and impenetrable. He expressed a preference for the models that have slats allowing border patrol officers to see through them.\n\nAs Mexicans watched from across the barrier, Mr. Trump described an epidemic of drugs and human traffickers that he has vowed to stop.

She will probably have to answer whether she would agree to reinstate waterboarding as the president has suggested and whether she believes that torture is an effective way to extract information from terrorism suspects.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t envy her trying to get through confirmation,\u201d said Robert Eatinger, the former top lawyer in the C.I.A.\u2019s Counterterrorism Center. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be the first chance for senators to have someone intimately involved in the program in front of them to answer questions. I think they\u2019ll take full advantage of that opportunity.\u201d\n\nSenators who were deeply critical of the interrogation program could stand in Ms. Haspel\u2019s way. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California and the former chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, oversaw its investigation into the program. The resulting 2014 report found that the program was deeply flawed and those involved portrayed it as more effective than it was, misleading policymakers. The extent of Ms. Haspel\u2019s role in the program is not known; only the report\u2019s executive summary was released, and it obscured the identities of agency operatives.\n\nMs. Feinstein has remained silent on whether she would block Ms. Haspel\u2019s nomination but told reporters on Tuesday that the two women had worked together since Ms. Haspel ascended to the C.I.A.\u2019s No. 2 post in February 2017.\n\n\u201cSince my concerns were raised over the torture situation, I have met with her extensively, talked with her,\u201d Ms. Feinstein said. \u201cShe has been, I believe, a good deputy director. She seems to have the confidence of the agency, which is good.\u201d\n\nSenator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who was held prisoner during the Vietnam War and tortured for five and a half years, demanded that Ms. Haspel publicly explain her role in the interrogation program.\n\n\u201cThe torture of detainees in U.S. custody during the last decade was one of the darkest chapters in American history,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe Senate must do its job in scrutinizing the record & involvement of Gina Haspel in this disgraceful program.\u201d\n\nMs. Haspel was also embroiled in another dark episode in the C.I.A.\u2019s interrogation program.\n\nIn 2005, Jose Rodriguez, then the head of the agency\u2019s clandestine service, ordered the destruction of videotapes of the waterboarding sessions. Ms. Haspel, serving as Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s chief of staff, was a strong advocate for getting rid of the tapes, former C.I.A. officers said.\n\nYears later, when the C.I.A. wanted to name Ms. Haspel to run clandestine operations, Ms. Feinstein blocked the promotion over Ms. Haspel\u2019s role in the interrogation program and the destruction of the tapes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmy Jeffress, a national security aide to former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. who served in London for the Justice Department while Ms. Haspel was C.I.A. station chief there, defended her.\n\n\u201cShe will be criticized for her role in the interrogation program, but my experience from working with her is that she has learned from those mistakes and will be a thoughtful and conscientious leader of the C.I.A.,\u201d Ms. Jeffress said.\n\nMs. Haspel was described former agency operatives and F.B.I. agents who worked with her as apolitical, a tough intelligence professional and direct but collegial. She has successfully managed sometimes difficult relationships with foreign intelligence services and the occasional grumpy F.B.I. agent.\n\nShe has succeeded in an agency traditionally dominated by men. After joining the C.I.A. in 1985, she was assigned to the Central European Division. She spent long stretches overseas, including in Turkey and Central Asia, before ascending to station chief in New York, where she was posted when Osama bin Laden was killed and worked closely with the F.B.I. as the agencies combed through files taken from his compound.\n\nShe has held two of the top three jobs in the clandestine service and twice ran the C.I.A.\u2019s station in London, a post made all the more important by the agency\u2019s relationship with MI6, the British intelligence service.\n\nBut her role in fighting terrorism is certain to draw the most scrutiny as her confirmation hearing looms.\n\nAfter the Sept. 11 attacks, the C.I.A. launched a desperate hunt around the globe to find those responsible. In 2002, agency operatives working with Pakistani authorities captured a Qaeda suspect, Abu Zubaydah, and ferried him to the C.I.A. prison in Thailand. He was harshly interrogated and waterboarded at least 83 times in one month, sent to the brink of death, revived and questioned over and over.\n\nMs. Haspel arrived to run the prison in late October 2002, after the harsh interrogation of Mr. Zubaydah, a former senior C.I.A. official said. In mid-November, another Qaeda suspect, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri arrived. Mr. Nashiri, accused of bombing the U.S.S. Cole, was the man who was waterboarded three times.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter the prison closed in early December 2002, former officials said, Ms. Haspel returned to the Counterterrorism Center outside Washington as an operations officer.\n\nOf the many difficult jobs she has held her career, former agency officials said, running the C.I.A. and managing the president would likely prove to be the hardest.\n\nMs. Feinstein said her support would hinge on the outcome of a meeting with Ms. Haspel, who contacted Ms. Feinstein on Tuesday morning to request one. Ms. Feinstein declined to detail what she would ask and what assurances she might seek in exchange for her support of Ms. Haspel\u2019s confirmation.\n\n\u201cThere is a difference,\u201d Ms. Feinstein said, \u201cbetween the second spot and the top spot.\u201d", "keywords": ["gina", "trumps", "agency", "played", "cia", "choice", "interrogation", "torture", "mr", "program", "feinstein", "role", "haspel", "ms"], "polarity": 0.08092582021153451, "subjectivity": 0.3770467627610485},

Thomas D. Waldhauser, did not mention the December battle in testimony to Congress this month and only broadly outlined the threats in the region. A senior House Republican aide said on Wednesday that lawmakers had been notified about the Dec. 6 attack soon after it happened.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis is reviewing the results of a lengthy internal investigation into the October ambush, near the border with Mali, which set off a widespread debate about why American troops are fighting a shadowy war in Niger. A military official said on Wednesday that Mr. Mattis was wrestling with the investigation\u2019s apparent attempts to blame low-level commanders for the deaths of the four soldiers and not implicate senior officers.\n\nThe families of the soldiers \u2014 Staff Sgt. Bryan C. Black, Staff Sgt. Dustin M. Wright, Staff Sgt. Jeremiah W. Johnson and Sgt. La David Johnson \u2014 have not been told of the investigation\u2019s conclusions, said the military official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the findings have not yet been released.\n\nThe Pentagon appears ready to scale back military operations in West Africa even further. A draft of the investigation, parts of which were described to The Times in February, called for the military to reduce the number of ground missions, and to strip commanders in the field of some authority to send troops on potentially high-risk patrols.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2017, there were about 10 instances of American troops and local training partners being attacked in Niger and elsewhere in West Africa, said Brig. Gen. Donald C. Bolduc, the former commander of United States Special Operations in Africa.\n\nEnemy fighters were killed in some of those unreported episodes, General Bolduc said on Wednesday, but there were no American casualties.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe existence of the Dec. 6 firefight was referenced in a terse line in an unclassified report the Trump administration gave to Congress this week about its legal and policy views on using military force. That report, obtained by The Times, mentioned only that a joint American-Nigerien force was attacked by a group of presumed Islamic State militants on that date, and returned fire \u201cin self-defense.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Reho portrayed the firefight as an act of self-defense after the unit happened to come under attack.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the mission was to set the conditions for future partner-led operations against violent extremist organizations in the region,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was no aspect of this mission focused on pursuing enemy militants, and the combined force was postured to respond as necessary in case contact with the enemy occurred.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWith that said, our forces do operate in unstable areas and are occasionally exposed to danger from enemy forces.

It sought to clear the potentially hostile area so that Nigerien forces could build a new outpost there. It is unclear if the small base was ever built.\n\nThe mission had attracted attention among American forces after the firefight, the official said, because it was one of the first major forays into the field in Niger since the Oct. 4 ambush.\n\nThe White House only this month approved giving combat pay to American troops deployed to Niger. Army soldiers in Niger are still not eligible for certain combat awards \u2014 including the Combat Infantry Badge and Combat Action Badge \u2014 that are highly respected and sometimes can help with promotion. The four soldiers who were killed in the Oct. 4 raid were given the awards posthumously, but those troops who have fought in Niger have not received them.\n\nQuestions about whether the American military, under the Trump administration, is seeking to obscure the expanding scope of operations in Africa were raised last week when it was revealed that the United States carried out four airstrikes in Libya between September and January that Africa Command failed to disclose at the time. The military has said it will acknowledge such missions if asked about them, even if it does not affirmatively disclose them in a news release.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Dec. 6 firefight was the main nugget of new information in the report that the Trump administration submitted to Congress this week, and was eagerly awaited by specialists on national security issues related to counterterrorism operations.\n\nThey hoped it would offer a thorough public explanation of issues \u2014 ranging from when the Trump administration thinks it can attack other countries without prior permission from Congress, to an acknowledgment that President Trump secretly relaxed limits on when the military or the Central Intelligence Agency can carry out kill-or-capture operations with drones or commando teams, away from conventional battlefields.\n\nBut the unclassified portion of the report, which was just over eight pages long, largely consisted of a slightly rewritten version of last December\u2019s version of the semiannual War Powers Resolution letter in which the executive branch lists deployments abroad.\n\nThe unclassified report gave only terse descriptions of certain matters while making no mention of key topics like Mr. Trump\u2019s changes to the drone strike rules, suggesting that they were relegated to the classified annex the public cannot see.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to see this administration show disrespect for Congress\u2019s effort to obtain public answers to key legal questions of our time,\u201d said Joshua Geltzer, a former senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council in the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cThis report was an opportunity to inform discussion on the Hill and, perhaps even more important, across the country on critical questions about when and why our country can take the grave step of using military force.

Thurman.\n\nWith no ambassador in place and the State Department in flux, Mr. Pottinger and his staff are handling much of the preparations for the meeting. But the National Security Council is itself on edge, amid persistent rumors that General McMaster might soon depart.\n\nEven in a hawkish administration, Mr. Pompeo\u2019s statements about North Korea have been hard-line. Last summer, speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, he came as close as any official in calling for the removal of Mr. Kim.\n\n\u201cThe thing that is the most dangerous about it is the character who holds the control over\u201d North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal, Mr. Pompeo said.\n\n\u201cFrom the administration\u2019s perspective, the most important thing we can do is separate those two.

But the scale of his margins in some suburbs was what surprised many, and likely pushed him over the top. Voters in the suburbs have also helped Democrats in other recent races, particularly in Alabama, where the Democrat, Doug Jones, beat the Republican favorite, Roy Moore.\n\nMr. Trump easily won Bethel Park in 2016; four years earlier, Mitt Romney racked up a 24-point win in Upper St. Clair, the affluent township next door. On Tuesday, Mr. Lamb, whose campaign signs dot the manicured lawns, won both by 10 points.\n\nMike DeVanney, a Republican political consultant in Pittsburgh, saw several things at work in Mr. Lamb\u2019s campaign, all of which are warning signs for Republicans in the midterm races in November. For many, he said, this was \u201cthe first opportunity to voice an opinion on Donald Trump,\u201d and that opinion, at least among the most motivated, was not favorable.\n\nBut it also showed the value of picking candidates \u2014 in Mr. Saccone, 60, a social conservative who was not the natural choice for many suburban Republicans, and in Mr. Lamb, a telegenic 33-year-old former Marine.\n\n\u201cYou have to give credit,\u201d Mr. DeVanney said. \u201cHe was clearly the best candidate they\u2019ve run for this district. And not only the best candidate but he executed a strong campaign.\u201d\n\nSome residents, even those who considered themselves Trump supporters, thought that most voters on Tuesday were only considering their disapproval of the president. The candidates themselves were more or less irrelevant.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cLightweights, the both of them,\u201d said Gary Berman, 75, a retired engineer sitting in the food court of the upscale South Hills Village shopping mall.

They did not deny the energized antipathy toward Mr. Trump, which arguably made this campaign competitive in the first place. But in such a tight race, there are still factors the candidates control that can sway the outcome.\n\nSamuel DeMarco, a Republican who sits on the Allegheny County Council, kept returning to what he saw as Mr. Saccone\u2019s missteps \u2014 poor fund-raising, missed events, the lack of a clear vision \u2014 particularly in contrast to the adroitness of Mr. Lamb.\n\nMr. DeMarco saw little campaigning by Mr. Saccone on the two policy matters he could have championed \u2014 the tax plan that the Republicans passed in December and the planned steel tariffs \u2014 and instead saw a pitch that boiled down to little more than his support of Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Saccone campaign ever gave the public a compelling reason to vote for him,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a Saccone thing when it comes to Republicans. It\u2019s a Trump thing when it comes to Democrats.\u201d\n\nStill, the distinction is not always so clear. For Janet Supko, 63, a retired schoolteacher who voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, the election was all about the president.\n\n\u201cThere have got to be some changes made,\u201d said Ms. Supko, who had just rounded the corner of Macy\u2019s in her morning walk at South Hills Village. While she had benefited from the Republican\u2019s income tax overhaul, she lamented the president\u2019s \u201clack of professionalism,\u201d the numerous hirings and firings, and the general sense of chaos in the White House.\n\nMr. Lamb was young and fresh and new; maybe he represented the change she had been hoping for when she voted for Mr. Trump in the first place.\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d she said, \u201cyou just have to try something else.\u201d\n\nHer walking partner, Clare Rex, 68, was never a fan of Mr. Trump, but for her, in the end, the election was about Mr. Lamb.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI saw him at the fish fry at Our Lady of Grace,\u201d she said. \u201cHe just seems to bring a fresh perspective.\u201d\n\nThe women came to the end of their walk at the Starbucks, where they met two friends, both Republicans, both Trump supporters, and neither surprised by what happened on Tuesday. Whether it was because of the Lamb campaign\u2019s savvy or anti-Trump energy on the Democratic side, they said, the win for Mr. Lamb, even here in a place that had not voted Democrat in years, seemed inevitable.\n\nOver the weekend, Christine Sorbara, 72, had gone to President Trump\u2019s rally in an airplane hangar in support of Mr. Saccone. She thought it probably helped him some.

Credit Erin Schaff for The New York Times\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 With hundreds of high school students massed at the Capitol to demand gun control, the House instead approved modest legislation on Wednesday to beef up school security without changes to the nation\u2019s gun laws, hoping to answer demands for action a month after the massacre in Parkland, Fla.\n\nAcross Capitol Hill, a top F.B.I. official conceded in Senate testimony that his agency had made mistakes in failing to follow up on tips about the gunman.\n\n\u201cWe clearly should have done more,\u201d David L. Bowdich, the acting deputy director of the F.B.I., told the Senate Judiciary Committee. He said the bureau was doubling the number of supervisors assigned to review tips from the public.\n\nThe House vote and the Senate hearing came as students across the country walked out of their classes to demand tougher gun laws after the rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. Hundreds rallied in front of the White House and at the Capitol, cheered on by congressional Democratic leaders.\n\nBut the school safety bill had no provisions relating to guns, and the Senate hearing was focused on law enforcement failures. Gun control advocates said neither addressed what they saw as the real problem: the proliferation of high-powered firearms used in mass shootings, not only at schools but at concerts, churches, movie theaters and other public places.\n\nThe House measure, which passed 407 to 10 as dozens of students looked down from the visitors\u2019 gallery, is one of a flurry of school safety bills that have been introduced in Congress \u2014 without curbs on guns.\n\nIt authorizes $500 million over 10 years for safety improvements, including training teachers and students in how to prevent violence and developing anonymous tip lines to detect threats. The money could also be used for physical improvements, such as metal detectors, but at the insistence of Democrats, a provision was added that bars the money from being used to arm teachers.\n\nImage David L.

He tapped a veteran clandestine officer, Gina Haspel, to lead the C.I.A.\n\nFiring Mr. McCabe, even on the recommendation of the disciplinary office, would be controversial.

But few have been the target of presidential ire like Mr. McCabe. Mr. Trump has repeatedly remarked on the fact that Mr. McCabe\u2019s wife, Jill, ran as a Democrat for a State Senate seat in Virginia. Her campaign received hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from a political committee run by Terry McAuliffe, the Virginia governor at the time and a longtime ally of the Clintons.\n\nMrs. McCabe lost the race and Mr. McCabe was later promoted to deputy director, where he oversaw the investigation into Mrs. Clinton. No charges were filed in that case, and Mr. Trump has pointed to the donations to Mr. McCabe\u2019s wife\u2019s campaign as evidence of F.B.I. bias.\n\nIn meetings with Mr. McCabe, the president questioned how he had voted and needled him about his wife, calling her a \u201closer,\u201d according to people familiar with the conversations.\n\nThe precise allegations against Mr. McCabe will not be clear until the full report is released. But what is publicly known does not fit neatly into Mr. Trump\u2019s theory of Mr. McCabe as a Democratic operator. Mr. McCabe has described himself to friends as a lifelong Republican voter.\n\nThe allegations revolve around disclosures to The Wall Street Journal, which revealed in October 2016 a dispute between the F.B.I. and Justice Department over how to proceed in an investigation into the Clinton family\u2019s foundation. The article said that the Justice Department would not authorize subpoenas in the case. Some F.B.I. agents, the article said, believed that Mr. McCabe had put the brakes on the investigation. Others rejected that notion.\n\nThe inspector general has concluded that Mr. McCabe authorized F.B.I. officials to provide information for that article. The public affairs office arranged a phone call to discuss the case, a common practice in the federal government when officials believe that a journalist has only part of the story.\n\nIn the Journal story, a person described as close to Mr. McCabe pushed back on the notion that he had tried to shut down the Clinton Foundation investigation. To the contrary, the person described a tense conversation with the Justice Department in which Mr. McCabe insisted his agents had the authority to keep investigating.\n\nThe article was a negative one for the Clinton campaign \u2014 not Mr. Trump. It was published just days before the election, after the F.B.I. reopened its investigation into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email practices. The article, including the F.B.I. disclosures, made it clear that some agents saw evidence of wrongdoing by the Clinton Foundation that was worth investigating.\n\nMr. McCabe joined the F.B.I. after law school and rose quickly through the ranks. Under the former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, he ascended through several senior leadership jobs, and it was clear that he was being groomed for the bureau\u2019s No. 2 position. His rise angered some rank-and-file agents. But supporters viewed him as a sophisticated, intellectual choice for a job that has become an integral part of the nation\u2019s intelligence community.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe deputy director is the chief operations officer at the F.B.I., a job that requires managing relationships with the White House and Congress.

Currently, Republicans control 13 of the 18 House seats. Experts think the newly drawn congressional districts will benefit Democrats.\n\nMr. Lamb is likely to run to be the Democratic candidate for the newly drawn 17th district, which includes more of the Pittsburgh suburbs and is favorable to Democrats.\n\nThat could be a crowded field for Democrats, according to Mr. Makhija, but he predicts Mr. Lamb will be a difficult candidate to beat in the primaries to be held on May 15.\n\nMr. Saccone is likely to run to be the Republican nominee in the new 14th district, which is heavily Republican. Mr. Makhija said the race for that seat has a fairly open field going into the Republican primaries.

W. Tillerson arriving in Djibouti on Friday, four days before he was fired. Some senior administration officials said Mr. Tillerson should have anticipated his ouster. Credit Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nAt a refueling stop in Cape Verde on his way home from an exhausting visit across Africa, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson walked through howling winds late Monday night toward the airport\u2019s V.I.P. terminal, where he pulled up a chair and started telling jokes to the reporters who had traveled with him.\n\nHe was fired by executive tweet just hours later.\n\nBy the time Mr. Tillerson again spoke to reporters, on Tuesday afternoon in Washington, the man who had strode confidently and relaxed throughout the weeklong diplomatic trip was replaced by a humbled and emotional one who nearly choked up as he announced that he would be handing off his powers at the stroke of midnight.\n\nSome senior administration officials said Mr. Tillerson \u2014 who in nearly 14 months at the State Department had departed from President Trump\u2019s policies on the Paris climate accord, the Iran nuclear deal and diplomacy with North Korea \u2014 should have seen it coming.\n\nImage Mr. Tillerson leaving Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on Friday. His tenure was punctuated by inopportune comments, bureaucratic inertia as well as frequent and public disagreements with the president. Credit Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nO fficials said John F. Kelly, the president\u2019s chief of staff, urged Mr. Tillerson late last week to cut short his trip, warning vaguely that he should be on the lookout for an unspecified Twitter post. But State Department officials insisted that had Mr. Kelly intended to relay an ominous message, Mr. Tillerson did not receive it.\n\nThat Mr. Tillerson missed such an important signal coming from the White House was emblematic of a tenure punctuated by inopportune comments, bureaucratic inertia and frequent and public disagreements with Mr. Trump.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Tillerson was often uncomfortable navigating the choppy and turgid waters of the Washington political scene. His favorite part of the job was meeting foreign leaders, as he did last week in what was intended to be a good-will tour to mend fences after Mr. Trump\u2019s vulgar justification in January for trying to block some Africans from immigrating to the United States.\n\nHis first stop on the five-nation trip was Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to visit the headquarters of the African Union. At a news conference, Mr. Tillerson was confronted by local reporters about Mr. Trump\u2019s coarse description of African countries. Gamely, Mr. Tillerson parried the questions \u2014 just as he had done this year in Latin America and Europe, where his reception had been similarly frosty.\n\nImage While in Addis Ababa, Mr. Tillerson seemed to delight in participating in a traditional Ethiopian coffee ceremony. Credit Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nHe seemed far more comfortable a few hours later, at a coffee ceremony on the grounds of the American Embassy. At times distant and intensely shy, Mr. Tillerson could often also be quite gracious, and took obvious delight when a colorfully dressed Ethiopian woman sat over a small fire and roasted coffee beans, flowers strewn about her. He gladly accepted a small white china cup filled with black liquid and drank it back.\n\nA turning point came several hours later. In a phone call around 2:30 a.m., he first learned that Mr. Trump had agreed to negotiate directly with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader \u2014 a diplomatic warming that Mr. Tillerson had offered in September to undertake, only to be publicly rebuffed by the president. The reversal began an important part of the trip for Mr. Tillerson: gaming out how such a meeting could be brought off successfully.\n\nIn repeated conversations throughout Africa with aides and reporters, Mr. Tillerson said his years as chief executive of Exxon Mobil taught him valuable lessons about how to handle such delicate conversations. His comments made clear that he expected to be deeply involved, for weeks if not months, in negotiations over how the talks with Mr. Kim would proceed.\n\nImage Mr. Tillerson arriving on Sunday to tour the Kenya Wildlife Service in Nairobi, Kenya. He seemed to delight in animals and the natural world. Credit Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nFrom Ethiopia, Mr. Tillerson flew to Djibouti and then Kenya, where he seemed in obvious physical distress during a news conference in Nairobi with Monica Juma, the country\u2019s cabinet secretary for foreign affairs. His aides later said that Mr. Tillerson was suffering from food poisoning after eating a piece of salmon in Ethiopia, and few on his staff were surprised when he canceled a planned trip to an H.I.V./AIDS clinic.\n\nBut he rallied the next day, on Sunday, to visit a Nairobi park that serves as a memorial to the more than 200 victims who were killed in a truck bombing against the American Embassy in Kenya on Aug. 7, 1998.\n\nFighting terror and protecting the physical safety of State Department employees were among the most consistent themes that Mr. Tillerson struck throughout his time as secretary, and the service in Nairobi allowed him to speak about both in the kind of somber tones that he favored.\n\n\u201cAs all of you well know, in 1998, terrorists thought they could demoralize and destroy the Kenyan and American people by attacking the U.S. Embassy here in Nairobi,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said. \u201cOf course, they were wrong. Nearly 20 years later, we meet here to honor those who we lost and those who were injured.\u201d\n\nImage Mr. Tillerson also paid homage on Sunday to the victims of the 1998 bombing against the American Embassy in Nairobi. Credit Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nHe also seemed to delight in animals and the natural world, and soon after his remarks, Mr. Tillerson headed to Nairobi National Park. A quick tour of a lab was followed by a private safari, the sort of fun that he had increasingly tried to inject into his travel schedule.\n\nBut with Washington roiled by news of the impending meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, Mr. Tillerson decided on Monday to compress his visits to Chad and Nigeria into one long day, then return home.\n\nIn a rare interview with reporters aboard his government plane as it flew west into the sunset, Mr. Tillerson was intent on impressing just how important such meetings with world leaders are.\n\n\u201cThis is what diplomacy looks like, O.K.?\u201d Mr. Tillerson said.\n\nThe plane landed before dawn on Tuesday at an Air Force base outside the capital. Just a few hours later, he was unceremoniously ousted by Mr. Trump in a Twitter post that showed little patience for the kind of diplomacy or d\u00e9tente that Mr. Tillerson had preached.\n\nImage Mr. Tillerson and his counterpart in Chad, Mahamat Zene Cherif, on Monday in N'Djamena, the capital.

Its shares have soared, and last year it posted record earnings and cash flow. Much of that money was made abroad, though, and a counterattack aimed at Boeing could reverberate into the farthest reaches of the nation\u2019s industrial economy.\n\nThe company employs 137,000 people in the United States, nearly as many workers as the entire primary steel and aluminum industries. Many more work at its suppliers, from Kansas to Pennsylvania, and those employees would also be at risk of a gut punch if China and other countries chose to make an example of Boeing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really worried about what it\u2019s going to do to us,\u201d said James Springer, a mechanic who installs stow bins and class dividers on 787 Dreamliners at Boeing\u2019s plant in North Charleston, S.C. \u201cWhat will the E.U. and China do, especially China? They are one of our biggest customers now.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBut China, too, depends on Boeing, and damage inflicted on the company would not be painless. China has a seemingly insatiable need for new aircraft, and can\u2019t yet make them domestically. Boeing is also set to open a finishing plant near Shanghai this year, so the Chinese government may put quality jobs at risk if it were to cut the company off.\n\n\u201cIf China decides to retaliate, it hurts their airlines and their burgeoning aerospace industry,\u201d said Scott Hamilton, the managing director at the Leeham Company, an aviation consulting firm in Bainbridge Island, Wash. \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d\n\nBut if China wanted to exact revenge on the United States through Boeing, it would be uniquely positioned to do so. The government has a significant stake in its national airlines and can easily direct them to cancel orders. About a quarter of Boeing\u2019s jetliners went to China last year, and analysts estimate that Chinese orders could account for up to a fifth of its backlog.\n\nUntil now, Mr. Trump has been a puzzle that Boeing mostly seemed to have figured out.\n\nThe president began the relationship even before his inauguration by proclaiming his displeasure at the cost of the next-generation Air Force One that Boeing is building. \u201cCosts are out of control, more than $4 billion,\u201d he declared on Twitter. \u201cCancel order!\u201d\n\nHe later told reporters that Boeing was \u201cdoing a little bit of a number,\u201d and said, \u201cWe want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTwo weeks later, Dennis A. Muilenburg, Boeing\u2019s chief executive, visited Mr. Trump in Florida and promised to keep the plane\u2019s cost down. \u201cIt was a terrific conversation,\u201d Mr. Muilenburg said afterward. \u201cGot a lot of respect for him. He\u2019s a good man. And he\u2019s doing the right thing.\u201d\n\nTwo months later, the president visited Boeing\u2019s South Carolina plant and, standing before a 787 Dreamliner, proclaimed, \u201cGod bless Boeing.\u201d\n\nWhile campaigning, Mr. Trump had repeatedly criticized the Export-Import Bank, which lends so much money to the company\u2019s customers that it has been referred to as \u201cBoeing\u2019s Bank.\u201d But in his first year as president, Mr. Trump decided to keep the bank alive.\n\nMr. Muilenburg has praised the president for the corporate tax cut, calling it \u201cthe biggest thing we could do in this country to unleash economic energy.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe past year and a half has indeed been good to Boeing. Its share price went up by 90 percent in 2017, making it the best performer in the Dow Jones industrial average. It has performed spectacularly so far this year.\n\nAt the end of February, the company cheerily announced that it had arrived at an agreement with Mr. Trump for an Air Force One with a new, lower price tag. \u201cPresident Trump negotiated a good deal on behalf of the American people,\u201d the company declared on Twitter. Two days later, Mr. Trump said he would pursue steep tariffs on steel and aluminum.\n\n\u201cThey found themselves bullied,\u201d Mr. Aboulafia said of Boeing. \u201cThey very intelligently did the smart thing and befriended the bully, and I think they are starting to find out that being friends with the bully is just as hard as being the victim of the bully.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe tariffs alone were never going to cost Boeing very much. It doesn\u2019t use a lot of steel, and the aluminum that encloses the body of its planes amounts to pocket change relative to an engine or the electronics system. The aircraft maker also has flexible, long-term contracts that often allow it to pass on some unanticipated cost increases to its customers, analysts said. Aluminum prices went up by more than 10 percent last year, and no one along the supply chain appeared to flinch.\n\nThe real risk is that China will lash out, and it\u2019s difficult to say how likely that could be. Boeing and its only real rival on that front, the European company Airbus, have backlogs that stretch into the next decade.\n\nA Chinese aerospace company, Comac, flew its first Boeing-sized jet in China in 2016, but it is years away from producing them. That may make it more attractive to punish a different American brand that makes something the Chinese can easily find elsewhere.\n\nOn the other hand, the Chinese government may have more leverage over Airbus than it seems. China is expected to surpass the United States to become the world\u2019s biggest aviation market by 2022, according to the International Air Transport Association. That growing dominance could help the government lean on Airbus to ramp up production to fill a potential hole left by Boeing, aerospace consultants said.\n\nA more moderate option for the Chinese would be to keep current orders on the books, but stop purchasing new Boeing aircraft. That could make for a less intense, but more drawn-out, period of pain for the manufacturer.\n\nIf it loses significant ground in China, analysts said, Boeing would eventually slow production and fire some of its mechanics. That could cripple the companies that make its airplane wings, noses, nuts and bolts.\n\n\u201cThere is this rippling effect where Boeing lays off people, and then the suppliers lay off people,\u201d said Rajeev Lalwani, a Morgan Stanley analyst. \u201cThat protectionism is in a way coming back to hurt the U.S.\u201d", "keywords": ["cost", "company", "tariffs", "trumps", "president", "war", "later", "china", "chinese", "boeing", "trump", "trade", "target", "mr", "boeings"], "polarity": 0.1488462582817421, "subjectivity": 0.3957824015888533},

Instead, after a brief phone call with Mr. Trump, he appeared in the State Department briefing room at 2 p.m. to confirm he would hand over his duties to his deputy at midnight.\n\n\u201cWhat is most important,\u201d he said, his voice thick with emotion, \u201cis to ensure an orderly and smooth transition during a time that the country continues to face significant policy and national security challenges.\u201d\n\nIn Mr. Pompeo, the president will have a hawkish secretary of state, who is more skeptical of diplomatic engagement with North Korea, just as Mr. Trump is preparing to meet the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and is far readier to rip up the Iran nuclear deal, two months before Mr. Trump faces his next deadline to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Tehran.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs Mr. Pompeo\u2019s replacement at the C.I.A., Mr. Trump named the current deputy director, Gina Haspel. A respected career official, she would be the first woman to lead the agency. But Ms. Haspel also oversaw a secret C.I.A. prison in Thailand when a terrorism suspect was waterboarded there and she later drafted a cable ordering the destruction of videotapes documenting brutal interrogations \u2014 both of which could complicate her Senate confirmation.\n\nAt the Department of Veterans Affairs, Mr. Trump has grown impatient with Mr. Shulkin, a politically moderate former hospital executive who served in the Obama administration. He recently sounded out Rick Perry, the current energy secretary, about taking over the department, according to two people close to the White House.\n\nFor Mr. Cohn\u2019s successor, the president said he was seriously considering Larry Kudlow, a Reagan administration official who is now a conservative commentator on CNBC. While Mr. Trump acknowledged differences with him on trade policy, he said Mr. Kudlow had come around to the argument that tariffs were an effective tool in negotiating trade deals.\n\nBesides, he added, \u201cLarry has been a friend of mine for a long time. He backed me very early in the campaign.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

One aide said he decided to replace Mr. Tillerson now to have a new team in place before the talks with Mr. Kim, which are scheduled to happen by May. But Mr. Tillerson was the most persistent advocate of opening talks with North Korea.\n\nThe White House\u2019s purge extended to Mr. Tillerson\u2019s staff. The under secretary of state for public affairs, Steve Goldstein, was fired after he issued a statement that seemed to contradict the White House. Mr. Tillerson\u2019s chief of staff, Margaret Peterlin, and his deputy chief of staff, Christine Ciccone, were also expected to depart.\n\nThat followed the early-morning dismissal of Mr. Trump\u2019s aide, John McEntee, who had his security clearance revoked and was escorted from the White House grounds.\n\nA former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, Mr. Tillerson had once been viewed as an intriguing, if unorthodox, cabinet choice. He had deep experience with Middle Eastern potentates, and knew President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia through Exxon\u2019s extensive efforts to explore for oil in Russia.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Mr. Tillerson\u2019s determination to bring a business sensibility to the State Department backfired, leaving it demoralized and understaffed. Despite his global experience, Mr. Tillerson was ill suited to the public duties of the United States\u2019 chief diplomat and was isolated from the career officials whom he often froze out of the most important policy debates.\n\n\u201cThe State Department clearly has not been built into the kind of global organization that one would prefer,\u201d Henry A. Kissinger, a former secretary of state, said in a telephone interview.\n\nMr. Kissinger said Mr. Pompeo\u2019s political skills would make him a better choice for the job. \u201cI have confidence that Pompeo understands this and will do it because I think he understands the political linkages better,\u201d he said.\n\nAlong with Mr. Kelly and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Mr. Tillerson had functioned as part of a triumvirate that was viewed as a brake on Mr. Trump. Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, once referred to them as \u201cthose people that help separate our country from chaos.\u201d\n\nMr. Tillerson was close to Mr. Mattis, meeting him regularly for breakfast. The defense secretary, who is traveling in Afghanistan, was not informed beforehand that Mr. Tillerson was being fired, according to an administration official. While Mr. Kelly was an early ally of Mr. Tillerson\u2019s, officials said he cooled on him because of his repeated clashes with the White House.\n\nMr. Tillerson had a rancorous relationship with both General McMaster and Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser. He resented that Mr. Trump had entrusted Mr. Kushner, a 37-year-old diplomatic neophyte, with the Middle East peace portfolio and trade negotiations with Mexico, according to people in the White House.\n\nWhen the National Security Council tried to send officials on Mr. Tillerson\u2019s trips, an official said, he either objected or excluded them from key meetings. And when the president named his daughter Ivanka Trump to lead a delegation to India, Mr. Tillerson downgraded the status of the State Department officials who accompanied her \u2014 irritating the president.\n\nBut his policy disagreements with the president appeared to be his undoing: Mr. Tillerson wanted to remain in the Paris climate accord; Mr. Trump decided to leave it. Mr. Tillerson supported preserving the Iran nuclear deal; Mr. Trump loathed the deal as \u201can embarrassment to the United States.\u201d And Mr. Tillerson called for dialogue to resolve the North Korean nuclear crisis, while Mr. Trump threatened a military strike.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Tillerson also broke with Mr. Trump in the bitter dispute between Saudi Arabia and Qatar \u2014 a decision that cost him with Persian Gulf leaders. The leaders, several of whom are visiting Washington in coming weeks, lobbied the White House to replace Mr. Tillerson with Mr. Pompeo.\n\nAt times, White House officials said, Mr. Tillerson\u2019s behavior verged on insubordination. The administration, for example, was extremely cautious in responding to reports that Russia was behind the deadly nerve-gas attack in Britain. But when Mr. Tillerson was asked about it in Africa, he said, \u201cIt appears that it clearly came from Russia.\u201d\n\nHis statement infuriated the White House, which had crafted its talking points with lawyers at the State Department to keep the United States in lock step with Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain. Instead, an official said, Mr. Tillerson made the White House look like it was soft on Mr. Putin, which he insisted was not the intention.\n\nMr. Tillerson\u2019s relations inside the State Department were scarcely better. The department\u2019s policymaking process devolved into conversations between Mr. Tillerson and a lone aide, Brian H. Hook, neither of whom had much experience with the countries they discussed.\n\n\u201cThe relationship between top management and the bulk of the State Department was toxic,\u201d said Ambassador James F. Jeffrey, a former senior diplomat. \u201cAnd that was a total mystery because the people at the State Department would work for the devil if he is advancing American interests, which Mr. Tillerson was.\u201d", "keywords": ["turns", "president", "white", "department", "house", "secretary", "tillersons", "loyalists", "mr", "pompeo", "america", "trump", "state", "reflect", "replacing", "tillerson", "views"], "polarity": 0.038853019995877126, "subjectivity": 0.36200306043163183},

Scott Applewhite/Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Republican leading the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation into Russian election interference softened his characterization of a key investigative finding on Tuesday, just a day after Republicans announced that they had completed a draft of their report.\n\nRepresentative K. Michael Conaway of Texas, who is leading the inquiry, had told reporters on Monday that the committee\u2019s Republicans had extensively reviewed a 2017 assessment by American intelligence agencies and found only one area of disagreement: that the Russians had favored Donald J. Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\n\u201cWe disagree with the narrative that they were trying to help Trump,\u201d Mr. Conaway said.\n\nSpeaking again with reporters on Tuesday, after American intelligence officials, Democrats and some Republicans on the committee appeared to dispute that conclusion, Mr. Conaway said it was a matter of interpretation whether the Russians were trying to hurt Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump\u2019s opponent, or explicitly help his candidacy.\n\n\u201cEverybody gets to make up their own mind whether they were trying to hurt Hillary or help Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a glass half full, glass half empty.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly Putin knows for sure what he wanted to do,\u201d Mr. Conaway added of the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, before playing down the issue.\n\nAmerican intelligence agencies concluded in January 2017 that Mr. Putin had personally \u201cordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election\u201d that shifted from trying to \u201cdenigrate\u201d Mrs. Clinton to developing \u201ca clear preference for President-elect Trump.\u201d\n\nBrian P. Hale, a spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, said on Monday that the agencies would review the committee\u2019s report but that they stood by their work.\n\nRepresentative Adam B. Schiff of California, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, said that after reviewing the same material the Republicans had, \u201cthe evidence is clear and overwhelming that the intelligence community assessment was correct.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican who played a crucial role in the investigation, appeared to agree with that sentiment.\n\n\u201cIt is also clear, based on the evidence, Russia had disdain for Secretary Clinton and was motivated in whole or in part by a desire to harm her candidacy or undermine her presidency had she prevailed,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Conaway said on Tuesday that his committee was taking issue with the intelligence agencies\u2019 \u201canalytic tradecraft,\u201d suggesting that analysts had assembled the relevant portion of the assessment using material that typically would not meet their own standards. He never disputed that the Russians had undertaken measures to try to disrupt the election.\n\nThe conclusion that the intelligence community had erred in its 2017 assessment about the Russians\u2019 intentions was one of the key Republican findings presented by Mr. Conaway. He also said the investigation had found no evidence of collusion between Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Russia to sway the 2016 election.\n\nRepublicans presented the 150-page document to Democrats on Tuesday for review and plan to initiate what could be a protracted declassification process to release it publicly.\n\nDemocrats on the panel blasted their Republican colleagues for \u201cprematurely\u201d closing the investigation without talking to crucial witnesses or compelling the production of a range of documents related to the case.\n\n\u201cIt is not a serious work, but then it wasn\u2019t designed to be,\u201d Mr. Schiff said of the draft Republican report.\n\nHe said Democrats intended to continue the investigation, where possible, without the Republicans\u2019 support. They also began drafting a report to counter the Republicans\u2019, he said, and on Tuesday evening issued a lengthy document detailing witnesses and documents that the committee had not yet pursued.\n\nMr. Schiff also asserted that the committee had seen \u2014 both publicly and behind closed doors \u2014 \u201csignificant evidence of collusion\u201d between the Trump campaign and Russia.

The main lobbies for the industry \u2014 the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and the Biotechnology Innovation Organization \u2014 said they had not taken a formal position on the legislation.\n\nThe drive for right-to-try legislation was spearheaded by the Goldwater Institute, a public policy organization that advocates free markets and limited government.\n\nStarlee Coleman, a policy adviser at the institute, said 38 states had adopted right-to-try laws, often with broad bipartisan support.\n\nThe House and Senate bills would establish a new pathway providing access to unapproved prescription drugs for certain patients who had exhausted other treatment options.

Vargas, a Democrat whose district includes part of San Diego, delivered a passionate rebuke of the president. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have immigrants, he wouldn\u2019t have wives!\u201d he said.

She seems to have the confidence of the agency, which is good.\u201d\n\nSenator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who was held prisoner during the Vietnam War and tortured for five and a half years, demanded that Ms. Haspel publicly explain her role in the interrogation program.\n\n\u201cThe torture of detainees in U.S. custody during the last decade was one of the darkest chapters in American history,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe Senate must do its job in scrutinizing the record & involvement of Gina Haspel in this disgraceful program.\u201d\n\nMs. Haspel was also embroiled in another dark episode in the C.I.A.\u2019s interrogation program.\n\nIn 2005, Jose Rodriguez, then the head of the agency\u2019s clandestine service, ordered the destruction of videotapes of the waterboarding sessions. Ms. Haspel, serving as Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s chief of staff, was a strong advocate for getting rid of the tapes, former C.I.A. officers said.\n\nYears later, when the C.I.A. wanted to name Ms. Haspel to run clandestine operations, Ms. Feinstein blocked the promotion over Ms. Haspel\u2019s role in the interrogation program and the destruction of the tapes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmy Jeffress, a national security aide to former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. who served in London for the Justice Department while Ms. Haspel was C.I.A. station chief there, defended her.\n\n\u201cShe will be criticized for her role in the interrogation program, but my experience from working with her is that she has learned from those mistakes and will be a thoughtful and conscientious leader of the C.I.A.,\u201d Ms. Jeffress said.\n\nMs. Haspel was described former agency operatives and F.B.I. agents who worked with her as apolitical, a tough intelligence professional and direct but collegial. She has successfully managed sometimes difficult relationships with foreign intelligence services and the occasional grumpy F.B.I. agent.\n\nShe has succeeded in an agency traditionally dominated by men. After joining the C.I.A. in 1985, she was assigned to the Central European Division. She spent long stretches overseas, including in Turkey and Central Asia, before ascending to station chief in New York, where she was posted when Osama bin Laden was killed and worked closely with the F.B.I. as the agencies combed through files taken from his compound.\n\nShe has held two of the top three jobs in the clandestine service and twice ran the C.I.A.\u2019s station in London, a post made all the more important by the agency\u2019s relationship with MI6, the British intelligence service.\n\nBut her role in fighting terrorism is certain to draw the most scrutiny as her confirmation hearing looms.\n\nAfter the Sept. 11 attacks, the C.I.A. launched a desperate hunt around the globe to find those responsible. In 2002, agency operatives working with Pakistani authorities captured a Qaeda suspect, Abu Zubaydah, and ferried him to the C.I.A. prison in Thailand. He was harshly interrogated and waterboarded at least 83 times in one month, sent to the brink of death, revived and questioned over and over.\n\nMs. Haspel arrived to run the prison in late October 2002, after the harsh interrogation of Mr. Zubaydah, a former senior C.I.A. official said. In mid-November, another Qaeda suspect, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri arrived. Mr. Nashiri, accused of bombing the U.S.S. Cole, was the man who was waterboarded three times.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter the prison closed in early December 2002, former officials said, Ms. Haspel returned to the Counterterrorism Center outside Washington as an operations officer.\n\nOf the many difficult jobs she has held her career, former agency officials said, running the C.I.A. and managing the president would likely prove to be the hardest.\n\nMs. Feinstein said her support would hinge on the outcome of a meeting with Ms. Haspel, who contacted Ms. Feinstein on Tuesday morning to request one. Ms. Feinstein declined to detail what she would ask and what assurances she might seek in exchange for her support of Ms. Haspel\u2019s confirmation.\n\n\u201cThere is a difference,\u201d Ms. Feinstein said, \u201cbetween the second spot and the top spot.\u201d", "keywords": ["gina", "trumps", "agency", "played", "cia", "choice", "interrogation", "torture", "mr", "program", "feinstein", "role", "haspel", "ms"], "polarity": 0.08092582021153451, "subjectivity": 0.3770467627610485},

His supporters assembled at an industrial park off in the distance.\n\nThe separation was by design: Organizers from each side said they wanted to stay apart and avoid clashes.

Vargas, a Democrat whose district includes part of San Diego, delivered a passionate rebuke of the president. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have immigrants, he wouldn\u2019t have wives!\u201d he said.

Kathy Robinson, who is African-American and from Burbank, and who works as a wedding photographer and Uber driver, voted in 2016 for Hillary Clinton. But after the election, she said she regretted that, and had come to view undocumented immigrants as a menace who take jobs away from American citizens. \u201cTrump is not racist,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s just against illegal immigrants.

Conservatives were using the Trump administration\u2019s effort to rein in federal overreach to reverse policies designed to protect against what the Obama administration had seen as discriminatory practices.\n\nThe \u201cRethink Discipline,\u201d package that Mr. Trump\u2019s commission will examine includes guidance that the Obama administration issued on the legal limitations on the use of restraints and seclusion, corporal punishment and equity for special education students.\n\nIn recent months, educators and policy experts from across the country have traveled to Washington to voice support for and opposition to the disciplinary guidance, in private meetings with officials at the Education Department and in a series of public forums.\n\nAt a briefing hosted by the United States Commission on Civil Rights, dozens of policy experts, researchers, educators and parents sounded off on the Obama-era discipline policy in a meeting that became so racially charged that some black attendees walked out.\n\nSince the discipline guidelines were issued, conservatives have blamed the document for creating unsafe educational environments by pressuring schools to keep suspension numbers down to meet racial quotas, even if it meant ignoring troubling and criminal behavior. Teachers who sought suspensions or expulsions of minority students were painted as racists, conservatives maintained.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEvidence is mounting that efforts to fight the school-to-prison pipeline is creating a school climate catastrophe and has if anything put at-risk students at greater risk,\u201d said Max Eden, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, who argued that teacher bias was not the driving force behind school discipline.\n\nBut proponents argued that racial bias was well documented.\n\nWhen the guidance was issued, federal data found that African-American students without disabilities were more than three times as likely as their white peers without disabilities to be expelled or suspended, and that more than 50 percent of students who were involved in school-related arrests or who were referred to law enforcement were Hispanic or African-American.\n\n\u201cChildren\u2019s safety also includes protection from oppression and bigotry and injustice,\u201d Daniel J. Losen, director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies at the University of California at Los Angeles\u2019s Civil Rights Project, wrote in testimony to the Civil Rights Commission. \u201cFear-mongering and rhetoric that criminalizes youth of color, children from poor families and children with disabilities should not be tolerated.\u201d\n\nThe Education and Justice Departments wrote in a 2014 Dear Colleague letter that discipline disparities could be caused by a range of factors, but the statistics in the federal data \u201care not explained by more frequent or more serious misbehavior by students of color.\u201d The departments also noted that several civil rights investigations had verified that minority students were disciplined more harshly than their white peers for the same infractions.\n\n\u201cIn short, racial discrimination in school discipline is a real problem,\u201d the guidance said.\n\nIn recent months, Ms. DeVos has said change will be coming. She has already moved to rescind a regulation that protects against racial disparities in special education placements. Her goal, she said last month, was to be \u201csensitive to all of the parties involved.\u201d\n\nIn a bruising interview on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on Sunday, Ms. DeVos said that the disproportionate discipline issue \u201ccomes down to individual kids.\u201d She declined to say whether she believed that black students disciplined more harshly for the same infraction were the victims of institutional racism.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re studying it carefully and are committed to making sure students have opportunity to learn in safe and nurturing environments,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. DeVos\u2019s office for civil rights also announced that it would scale back the scope of investigations, reversing an approach taken under the Obama administration to conduct exhaustive reviews of school districts\u2019 practices and data when a discrimination complaint was filed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Ms. DeVos\u2019s own administration has continued to find racial disparities. In November, the Education Department found that the Loleta Union Elementary School District in California doled out harsher treatment to Native American students than their white peers. For example, a Native American student received a one-day out-of-school suspension for slapping another student on the way to the bus, in what was that student\u2019s first disciplinary referral of the year. A white student received lunch detention for slapping two students on the same day \u2014 the student\u2019s fifth and sixth referrals that year.\n\nWhile Mr. Cruz was repeatedly kicked out of class and ultimately expelled, it is unclear whether he was ever referred to the police for his behavior in school. However, Mr. Cruz was known to law enforcement, which never found cause to arrest him, and a report of troublesome behavior to the F.B.I. went unheeded.\n\nThe Broward County superintendent, Robert Runcie, said that Mr. Rubio\u2019s effort to connect the district\u2019s discipline policies to the Stoneman Douglas shooting was misguided.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to dismantle a program that\u2019s been successful in the district because of false information that someone has put out there,\u201d Mr. Runcie said on Twitter. \u201cWe will neither manage nor lead by rumors.\u201d", "keywords": ["education", "shootings", "school", "policies", "finds", "law", "discipline", "students", "guidance", "culprit", "rights", "program", "unlikely", "trump", "rubio", "mr", "obama"], "polarity": 0.05929752786895644, "subjectivity": 0.4110812996527283},

But it\u2019s more than a competitive event.\n\nImage Miguel Cruz Jr., background, with Jorge Cruz Credit G L Askew II for The New York Times\n\nThe men gather at an open field in a recreation area of the San Fernando Valley every Sunday, putting chalk to the dusty ground to draw the boundaries of a game that has been a weekly ritual as long as many can remember . After they are done, these men and others who filter in cluster into distinct teams, tossing a six-pound rubber ball to warm up.\n\nOn a recent Sunday, one of them, Jorge Cruz, 39, lifted a 15-pound glove studded with nails and other ornamentation in the air. He glanced back at his teammates and asked, \u201cYou guys ready?\u201d in Zapotec, an indigenous Oaxacan language, before bouncing the ball on a cement slab known as el saque and hitting it toward the opposing team.\n\nThis is how you start a game of pelota mixteca, a ballgame said by its players in California to have originated hundreds of years ago in Oaxaca, Mexico, though theories abound about whether it is an offshoot of an ancient Mesoamerican game or a European sport brought to the New World . Wherever it arrived, it serves not only as a pastime: It is also a way of keeping its players\u2019 culture alive, and serves as a network for an immigrant community throughout the West Coast. It has even spawned an under-the-radar international tournament.\n\n\u201cMy dad first brought me out here when I was 17, but now I come on my own and I bring my children,\u201d Jorge Cruz said, pausing during one of the games. \u201cHe would always tell me that this was one of the ways that we could preserve our culture.\u201d\n\nHe is not alone. More than two dozen other Oaxacan players who speak indigenous languages like Zapotec and Mixtec travel to the pasajuegos (games) every week from Southern and Northern California cities, and each makes the journey to the San Fernando Valley for many of the same reasons.\n\nImage Jorge Cruz, 39 Credit G L Askew Ii for The New York Times\n\nImage At first glance, pelota mixteca might resemble elements of baseball, volleyball and tennis, but a closer examination reveals a bit more nuance. Each jugada, as each individual game is called, involves approximately 10 players, and begins when one player initiates a serve from the cement slab. Credit G L Askew II for The New York Times\n\nMr. Cruz\u2019s father, Reynaldo Cruz, 71, introduced the game to his son to preserve Oaxacan culture and his family\u2019s native language. The elder Cruz speaks an Oaxacan language known as Valle (valley), as well as Zapotec, an indigenous language spoken by 400,000 people, which is recognized more frequently, according to Pamela Munro, a professor of linguistics at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nBecause a majority of the pelota mixteca players live in communities where Spanish or English are spoken rather than Zapotec, second-generation Oaxacan children are less likely to preserve that language or any of the other indigenous languages spoken during play .\n\n\u201cThey often shy away from speaking their indigenous language because of the legacy of racism, which forces them to sometimes hide and cloak their identities,\u201d said Rafael V\u00e1squez, 37, a scholar who is working on a book about Mexican ethnicity and multilingualism . \u201cWhen there\u2019s a safe space they often feel more free to speak in their native languages.\u201d\n\nMost of the men who play pelota mixteca are first-generation immigrants who were part of successive waves of Oaxacans who settled in and around Los Angeles beginning in the 1980s. Like Reynaldo Cruz, many of these people chose to live in Oaxacan communities.\n\nImage Jorge Cruz Jr., left, and Jorge Lopez Credit G L Askew II for The New York Times\n\nFor second-generation Oaxacan youths in the United States, speaking indigenous languages in school or public spaces is often met with sharp ridicule because of negative stereotypes from Mexican-Americans, the scholars said.\n\n\u201cMany Spanish speakers in Mexico are quite prejudice d against people who speak indigenous languages,\u201d Ms. Munro said. \u201cThe Spanish term indio (Indian) in Mexico is a highly prejudicial term, and a lot of that carries over to indigenous people in the U.S.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, some families believe that learning Spanish instead of their indigenous language provides more economic opportunities both in the U.S. and in Mexico, according to Mr. Vasquez.\n\nA number of Oaxacan youths are making efforts to \u201crevitalize\u201d these indigenous languages by playing sports like pelota mixteca and making frequent trips to Oaxaca. It provides an environment free from the stigma or the expectation to adopt Spanish.\n\nStill, pelota mixteca is far from a perfect game. And while most of the men are married and are doting husbands and fathers, the game reveals strong questions about the role of gender in the sport. Women are not on the field and if the men\u2019s wives attend the games, they often look after the children while their husbands play.\n\nSome of the players believe that women cannot handle the physical strain of the game, said Paula Mota, 25, a graduate student at California State University, Northridge, who has spent three years observing and researching this group of pelota mixteca players. But she added that there were some women\u2019s teams in Mexico.\n\nImage A glove and balls used in pelota mixteca. Players must order their gloves from highly sought-out artisans who live in Oaxaca, a process that can take up to a few months and cost between $200 and $300. Credit G L Askew Ii for The New York Times\n\nWhat began as a game between local Los Angeles residents almost 20 years ago has in recent years emerged as an under-the-radar international tournament, with players coming from as far as Texas and Oaxaca twice a year to play in local tournaments.\n\nOther players \u2014 particularly those who are undocumented \u2014 use the pelota mixteca social media network as a way to share helpful information for community members facing the threat of deportation, particularly when traveling to and from tournaments.\n\nNews about laws like SB-1070, a bill that passed in Arizona in 2010 that requires the police to determine the immigration status of people detained or arrested when there is \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d of their immigration status, spread throughout the pelota mixteca community and caused concern among players who hoped to travel to different states to play. At the same time, the widespread accessibility of social media has meant that it is a place where players can strategize about safe travel routes .\n\nPelota mixteca continues to be played in relative obscurity every Sunday , but a younger generation of players has appeared on the field. Mr. Cruz now brings his son Jorge, 15, and his nephew, Miguel Angel, 9, to the games with him every weekend, as his father once did more than 20 years ago.\n\nThe rally ended and the younger Jorge Cruz, walked off the field to take a break from the blazing San Fernando Valley heat. \u201cI feel empowered and excited that I\u2019m playing the same game that my ancestors did,\u201d he said while catching his breath. \u201cIf I have children one day, I\u2019m going to teach them this game, too, so that they don\u2019t lose our heritage.\u201d", "keywords": ["culture", "language", "sport", "alive", "pelota", "game", "oaxacan", "york", "mixteca", "cruz", "players", "jorge", "keeping", "indigenous"], "polarity": 0.07625170625170624, "subjectivity": 0.38048165048165056},

(We do not meet Perry or Don.) But who gets to \u201ccount\u201d as diverse is one of the play\u2019s horrible-hilarious wrangles. In an argument with Roberta, a member of Hillcrest\u2019s development staff, Sherri insists that the school\u2019s admissions catalog must depict a student body that is visually diverse \u2014 so Perry, who is light-skinned, doesn\u2019t count. To comply, Roberta (Ann McDonough) has to stage photos that feature recognizably dark-skinned students, reading \u201cThe Bluest Eye\u201d no less.\n\nPerry may not be black enough for the catalog, but Charlie certainly thinks he was black enough for Yale, and accepted for that reason. In an astonishing 17-minute howl of disappointment, he undoes a lifetime of indoctrination as he dissects the logical fallacies on which, he feels, his parents\u2019 values \u2014 and Yale\u2019s, and Hillcrest\u2019s \u2014 are based.\n\nPhoto\n\nIs Pen\u00e9lope Cruz a person of color?

Should white people hate white people?\n\nThe evening I saw it, this line of thought had the audience roaring and clapping and then seeming to want to retract both responses as Charlie veered into ever more uncomfortable ideas.\n\nThat\u2019s good satire at work, causing us to think critically about people we don\u2019t at first recognize as images of ourselves. And the discomfort only deepens when Charlie, stung by his parents\u2019 reaction to his tirade \u2014 his father calls him a spoiled brat \u2014 reconsiders his position and makes a startling decision.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Her assumptions of privilege, however unexamined, will not be denied. The crux of Mr. Harmon\u2019s argument, which is as tightly constructed as a finger-trap toy \u2014 almost every piece of information supplied at the start pays off by the end \u2014 is that hypocrisy may look a lot like love.\n\nSatires don\u2019t usually go there. Recent racial comedies, like Branden Jacobs-Jenkins\u2019s \u201cAn Octoroon\u201d and Bruce Norris\u2019s \u201cClybourne Park,\u201d have been built on ludicrously bad behavior, and let the results speak for themselves. \u201cAdmissions\u201d is less extreme but also, as a result, harder to put across. The characters are caught somewhere between well-observed types and absurd caricatures. Sherri\u2019s mama bear ferocity is necessary to turn the plot, just as Charlie\u2019s hysteria about Yale is, but in real life both would be subtler. Of course, in real life this plot wouldn\u2019t happen.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t happen onstage. As in his previous plays \u201cBad Jews\u201d and \u201cSignificant Other,\u201d Mr. Harmon is admirably unafraid of portraying incorrectness in the guise of sour comedy. In a way, Charlie is a combination of Daphna, the relentless scold of \u201cBad Jews,\u201d and Jordan, the whiny wallflower of \u201cSignificant Other.\u201d But \u201cAdmissions\u201d is even better for being about something substantially larger than one character\u2019s unhappiness.\n\nStill, I\u2019m not sure that Daniel Aukin\u2019s warm and intermittently rollicking production finds the right tone. Though there are moments in which the mere placement of bodies on the Newhouse\u2019s thrust stage is enough to make you anxious, there are too many others that seem to pull back from the blinding clarity that\u2019s needed. (Mark Barton\u2019s lighting is way too gentle.) When the actors, generally working in a naturalistic vein, tear into their characters\u2019 most unhinged moments they seem to be grinding gears. You find yourself questioning the likelihood of their behavior when, ideally, you would be too breathless to study it.\n\nNo matter. One of the things the theater should be doing today, and rarely does, is lancing the boil of our own self-deception. \u201cAdmissions,\u201d as that pun of a title suggests, is a kind of confessional, except that no forgiveness is offered, or deserved.", "keywords": ["bad", "york", "parents", "perry", "yale", "characters", "charlie", "reading", "diversity", "white", "admissions", "review", "skewering", "pieties"], "polarity": 0.05541869588744589, "subjectivity": 0.4884913870851372},

Along with its byproduct, patis (fish sauce), it\u2019s an essential seasoning that claims a place on the table next to suka (vinegar) and banana ketchup (bananas cooked down in vinegar and tomato paste), as much a condiment as an ingredient.\n\nAs such, it\u2019s part of what the Manila-born food historian Doreen Fernandez termed a \u201cgalaxy of flavor-adjusters\u201d that define how Filipinos eat: seasonings added to dishes after they\u2019re served, in trickles and pinches, according to each diner\u2019s taste. A chef feeding Filipinos must sublimate ego and accept that no dish emerges from the kitchen fully finished. A meal is a joint effort between cooks and eaters.\n\nIF BAGOONG IS THE SALT, suka is the sour lifeblood of the cuisine. Extracted from sugar cane or the sap from coconut trees or nipa palms, it was originally a necessary preservative in a warm climate.\n\nHow to take the bounty of fish from the surrounding seas and make it last? Cure it in suka and it becomes kinilaw, an ancient recipe that may have been one of the earliest forms of ceviche. To this might be added the bite of ginger, the silkiness of coconut milk, or a sunny kiss of calamansi, which has a sharper sting than lime.\n\nFor another staple, daing na bangus, milkfish is relieved of its bones, splayed and soaked in vinegar overnight for tenderness, then crisped in a pan. You can eat the flesh with a spoon.\n\nPhoto\n\nLumpia, cousins to Chinese spring rolls, are dunked in sawsawan (dipping sauce), which may be as straightforward as vinegar with a stutter of raw garlic.

(\u201cIt\u2019s really ours,\u201d said Romy Dorotan, the chef of Purple Yam in Brooklyn.) At its base, adobo is a long braise of meat in vinegar and garlic, but other ingredients are up for debate: Some swear by soy sauce while others dismiss it as an import; some stir in achuete oil (made from annatto seeds), coconut milk, sugar or squid ink.\n\nOf all Filipino dishes, adobo \u201chas the most leeway for a cook\u2019s imagination, hubris, art or bigoted sense of one\u2019s own mother\u2019s love-and-greatness,\u201d the novelist Gina Apostol said. There are nearly as many manifestations of adobo as there are Filipinos.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut is adobo the dish that speaks most directly to the Filipino soul? Ms. Fernandez argued otherwise, in favor of sinigang, a soup she described as \u201cthe dish most representative of Filipino taste,\u201d in part because it\u2019s adaptable \u201cto all classes and budgets.\u201d Recipes differ, but the goal is the same: a sourness so profound that the first sip should make you shudder.\n\n\u201cSinigang is what my mother would make for me when I was sick,\u201d said Alexandra Cuerdo, the director of the documentary \u201cUlam: Main Dish,\u201d about the rise of Filipino food in America, which is set to premiere at the San Francisco International Film Festival next month.\n\nThe souring agent in sinigang changes by the map: It might be tamarind, guava, alibangbang leaves, kamias (the fruit of the sorrel tree), batuan (kin to mangosteen) or unripe pineapple \u2014 whatever is on hand in the region. Place matters to Filipinos, who often have tangled roots as a result of internal migration and speak multiple languages.\n\nAt Lasa, the chef Chad Valencia uses rhubarb for sinigang when it\u2019s in season. \u201cOur region is Los Angeles,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nSTILL, NO ONE DISH can sum up the Filipino palate. \u201cA feast of different flavors is optimal,\u201d said Nicole Ponseca, who runs Maharlika and Jeepney in New York. \u201cSauces meld, complement, make whole.\u201d\n\nTo balance the sourness of adobo and sinigang, she suggests kare-kare, a nutty-sweet stew of oxtail, bok choy, string beans and eggplant, traditionally simmered with ground peanuts and achuete oil; peanut butter, a modern substitute, lends voluptuousness.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe history of kare-kare is often traced to a 20-month interregnum in the 18th century when the British wrested Manila from the Spanish. Indian cooks attending the Royal Navy brought the name and notion of curry to the islands, and had to make do with local spices.\n\nKare-kare, sinigang and adobo are likely to appear on most Filipino menus in the United States, from turo-turo (point-point) steam-table joints to sophisticated restaurants. So, too, is dinuguan, a pork-blood stew that can pose a challenge even for Filipinos.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWhen I was growing up, dinuguan was a kind of culinary boogeyman, a dish that adults would tell gory stories about to scare children,\u201d said Genevieve Villamora, one of the owners of Bad Saint.\n\nThe opaque stew, classically loaded with offal, is often passed off by Filipino immigrant parents as \u201cchocolate meat\u201d to their suspicious children. King Phojanakong, the chef of Kuma Inn in New York, remembers wondering, \u201cWhy was it so dark?\u201d\n\nBut the mineral-rich blood is what gives the stew its ballast and faintly metallic hint of a licked knife. It must be cooked carefully so that the blood doesn\u2019t congeal; done right, it turns to velvet. At Bad Saint, dinuguan has become one of the best-selling dishes, without the veil of euphemism.\n\nIF COOKING IS A VEHICLE for memory, for many Filipinos the dishes of their heritage are inseparable from days of celebration. \u201cFood marks the occasion,\u201d said Angela Dimayuga, who grew up in the Bay Area and was most recently the chef of Mission Chinese Food in New York.\n\nIt\u2019s considered particularly lucky to eat pancit (noodles) on birthdays, their uncut strands promising long life. The name of the noodles is derived from a Hokkien phrase for \u201cfast food.\u201d Like their Chinese antecedents, they come in different shapes and textures: miki (made with egg), bihon (rice), sotanghon (mung bean) and canton (wheat). Recipes might include sluices of soy sauce and calamansi and toppings of shrimp heads, quail eggs, shucked oysters or chicharron.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor the highest occasion \u2014 like Ms. Dimayuga\u2019s grandmother\u2019s 99th birthday last year \u2014 there can be only one centerpiece: lechon, whole roasted pig, its shining, lacquer-thin skin primed to shatter.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s trendy here to go head to tail, but there it\u2019s just a way of life,\u201d Mr. Phojanakong said. After a party, the lechon is broken down: \u201cYou use the head for sisig\u201d \u2014 a sizzle of jowl and ears \u2014 \u201ctrotters for adobo, make dinuguan with blood and innards and turn leftovers into paksiw,\u201d a vinegary stew contoured with a p\u00e2t\u00e9-like liver spread.\n\nThe backdrop to these dishes is always rice. Its earthy scent is the constant when you walk into a Filipino home, almost a ripening in the air. To Ms. Fernandez, rice was \u201cthe shaper of other foods,\u201d its soothing blandness allowing other dishes to be stronger in contrast.\n\nGlutinous rice is used, too, for kakanin, a genre of snacks that includes puto, little steamed cakes of ground rice and coconut milk, often accompanying dinuguan; suman, logs of sticky rice wrapped in banana leaves; and thick, gilded rounds of bibingka, perfumed with coconut and somehow fluffy and chewy at once.\n\nPhoto\n\nWheat, which came to the Philippines with the Spanish, also has its place in daily life. At any time of day, pan de sal, a simple bread roll, is nourishment. Isa Fabro, a pastry chef in Los Angeles, slakes hers in butter suffused with ube halaya (a jam of purple yam) and latik, a coconut-milk concentrate close in spirit to dulce de leche.\n\nSome popular desserts that have European origins are now thought of as wholly Filipino: wobbly leche flan, custard under a gooey drape of caramel; Sans Rival, a dacquoise-like palimpsest of cashews, meringue and buttercream, which the chef Nora Daza served in the 1970s at her Paris restaurant Aux Iles Philippines to the likes of Brigitte Bardot and Simone de Beauvoir; and mango royale, a crema de fruta turned icebox cake, with layers of cream and mangos teetering on overripe.\n\nBeyond these greatest hits are regional specialties, which Mr. Dorotan, a native of Bicol in southeastern Luzon, wishes would get more attention. At Purple Yam, he makes laing, taro leaves simmered in coconut milk (the trademark of Bicolano cooking) until lush.\n\nBut which regional specialties does he want to see more of? He laughed. There are so many islands.\n\n\u201cEven I do not know,\u201d he said.\n\nRecipes: Mango Royale | Oxtail Stew in Peanut Sauce (Kare-Kare) | Pork Sinigang\n\nFollow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

Image A winter storm in Erie blanketed the McBride Viaduct in snow. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\nERIE, Pa. \u2014 Despite the \u201cRoad Closed\u201d barriers blocking cars and trucks, Elizabeth Feliciano trudged the other morning on foot across the McBride Viaduct, late for school. Arching over a gritty scrap-metal yard and railway line, the graffiti-scrawled 1,170-foot-long bridge links two of this city\u2019s poorest neighborhoods.\n\nImage\n\nWhen the viaduct opened in the late 1930s, the city was growing. The bridge, renovated in the 1970s, was an emblem of local pride and progress. It funneled traffic through what were at the time thriving neighborhoods.\n\nThen the factories started disappearing. The viaduct\u2019s largely German, Polish and Irish district became home to increasing numbers of blacks, Latinos and refugees from Africa and the Middle East, whose arrivals have slowed the city\u2019s population decline.\n\nOn one level, the story of the bridge is a microcosm of America\u2019s crumbling infrastructure. Questions about where to spend the city\u2019s limited resources touch on familiar themes about the failures of urban renewal and today\u2019s widening income gap.\n\nAt the same time, the debate over the fate of a decaying relic of midcentury industrial architecture has focused a particular spotlight on Erie\u2019s legacy of disenfranchisement and its troubled race relations.\n\nImage Mary Whalen prayed before the noon Mass at St. Anne's Church just north of the viaduct. The viaduct is named for a former pastor of the church, Msgr. Lawrence McBride, who campaigned for its construction after a child was killed crossing the tracks. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\nThe legacy lives on: Erie was recently ranked the worst city in the country for African-Americans. Using national census data, the news organization 24/7 Wall Street found that 47 percent of the city\u2019s black population lives at or below the national poverty line, twice the rate for African-Americans nationally and more than four times the rate for whites in Erie.\n\nAfter the ranking was published in November, The Erie Times-News took issue with some of the survey\u2019s numbers, but not the gist. Median income for black residents in the city languishes at around half that of white residents; the unemployment rate is more than triple the national average.\n\nAnd City Hall is perceived by many black residents as an enclave of white privilege.\n\n\u201cThis city spends a huge amount to pay for police to incarcerate people from our community,\u201d said Cee Williams, a former Erie County poet laureate. There are only eight minority police officers of the 173 officers employed by the city.\n\n\u201cHow about spending some of that money on fixing the bridge,\u201d Mr. Williams said, suggesting that such an approach \u201cmight help change the lives of kids who end up costing the public a fortune in prison.\u201d\n\nImage Police officers responded to a domestic disturbance call at a home in the lower east side of Erie, during a winter storm that caused widespread power failures. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\nThe bridge, a picturesque ruin riddled with potholes, is today a victim of this region\u2019s harsh weather and an unspoken City Hall policy of demolition by neglect. Lately, students from Gannon University, on the other side of Erie, have adopted it as a hangout and cause \u2014 a miniature untapped version of New York\u2019s repurposed rail tracks known as the High Line. Local teenagers use it as a de facto elevated park, for lack of green space.\n\nMore than a few, like Ms. Feliciano, walk or bike across it because, as she said, \u201cit\u2019s still the safest, shortest route\u201d over the tracks. It is better, they contend, than the pedestrian path, with its dangerous street crossing, along a busy expressway that the city built a block away.\n\nOne city block may not seem far. But to those who have to walk it, it can seem like another unfair burden that some in the community have been forced to bear. Unlike the expressway, the viaduct \u201cgoes where we want to go,\u201d Ms. Feliciano said.\n\nLandscape architects have a poetic term for this. They call it a desire line.\n\nStill, Erie officials are poised to tear the bridge down, insisting the cost of its repair and maintenance is simply prohibitive. They say only a clique of preservationists really cares about saving the viaduct, noting that residents from the neighborhood rarely showed up at public meetings over the years to support it.\n\nImage Taquanta Gray and Noel Remigio at home with their daughter, Nivea, 2, and dog, Blue. Ms. Gray said she used the bridge regularly to visit her parents and extended family. The loss of the bridge would mean a longer, more perilous commute for the family, she said. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\n\u201cThe reason black people weren\u2019t showing up at public meetings to talk about the viaduct is that they have lost hope,\u201d said Shantel Hilliard, longtime executive director of the Booker T. Washington Center. \u201cWhy bother when things here never change?\u201d\n\nAlso called the East Avenue Bridge, the viaduct opened in 1938. A Catholic pastor in the neighborhood, Msgr. Lawrence McBride of St. Ann\u2019s Church, campaigned for the bridge after a child was killed trying to cross the tracks.\n\nFor decades, the span fed thousands of pedestrians, cars and trucks onto East Avenue, the area\u2019s main street. But it was shut to traffic almost eight years ago, after officials had poured some $180 million into the expressway over the tracks, called the Bayfront Connector, which was completed in 2005. The Bayfront Connector was, in essence, an old-fashioned traffic engineer\u2019s vision of urban renewal, with all the predictable results.\n\nThe expressway sped suburbanites in their cars in and out of Erie. But it cleaved a struggling inner-city district, cutting off homes from schools, devastating East Avenue businesses, turning neighborhood streets into dead ends and deflating already-low housing values, while encouraging crime on some of those dead-end streets.\n\nThe city\u2019s new mayor, Joe Schember, had barely moved into City Hall in January before announcing his determination to tear the old bridge down \u201cas quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nMr. Schember, a Democrat, acknowledged the expressway\u2019s ill consequences, and even brought up that damning report about Erie and its black population.\n\nImage Kamarion Barney, 13, walked home from school over the McBride Viaduct. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\nBut after consulting some of the same city and state engineers who devised the connector, he concluded that the McBride bridge was no longer safe or needed, and that it might cost some $6 million to fix, more than he believes this straitened city can afford.\n\nPreservationists angrily reject the mayor\u2019s figures, conjecturing a far lower cost to keep the bridge open just for pedestrians and bikes. They point to a new $5 increase in vehicle registration fees that promises Erie an additional $1.4 million a year for infrastructure improvements, a fund that could help pay to fix the bridge.\n\n\u201cWe have serious problems on the east side,\u201d Mr. Schember said. \u201cIf the city is going to put money to work there, there are much more worthwhile things to spend it on than the viaduct.\u201d\n\nHe has yet to spell those things out. In place of the viaduct, the city has been contemplating larger parking lots.\n\nFor East Side residents \u2014 many of whom cannot afford cars and who often take their lives into their hands dashing on foot across the multilane expressway, scrambling over its concrete Jersey barriers to get home or to the neighborhood Walmart \u2014 the viaduct remains not just a way to get where they are going. It is a measure of where the city is headed.\n\nImage From left, Traivyon Spencer, 3, Kiahra Moffett, 11, and Shalee Spencer, 12, hopped over several concrete barricades to cross the Bayfront Connector on their way home after school. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t equity mean that if you subtract something, you need to add something in return?\u201d said the Rev. Anthony Harris, who oversees the largely black congregation at Shiloh Baptist Church, near the viaduct.\n\nMayor Schember has lately promised new, safer pedestrian crossings along the connector and improvements to the expressway\u2019s pedestrian path over the tracks. With funds having already been allocated for the viaduct\u2019s demolition, he said, acting expeditiously on the low bid by an out-of-town firm called Swank may throw off \u201cadditional resources\u201d for \u201cbeautifying that area, for which we will seek resident input,\u201d he said.\n\nThe mayor has in the meantime endorsed Erie Refocused, a comprehensive plan he inherited from the previous administration that was never carried out. Among other things, it calls for improved community engagement, public spaces and streets geared more toward pedestrians and bikes.\n\nThese are precisely the arguments for fixing the viaduct, preservationists say.\n\nImage A gate where people can gain access and cross the train tracks through the grounds of scrap yards and industrial businesses. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\nTheir opponents include R. Jason Wieczorek, an architect in the Erie office of Bostwick Design Partnership. His grandfather was a second-generation Polish-American who settled on the east side and worked for General Electric, where Mr. Wieczorek\u2019s father also worked, before the company drastically downsized.\n\nMr. Wieczorek has two young children, lives on the West Side, and endorses the idea of investing in downtown and along the waterfront, to attract more businesses and tourists, not in what he called \u201cfailing neighborhoods\u201d on the east side.\n\n\u201cI cannot find the type of housing, with neighbors I would want to live with, on the east side,\u201d Mr. Wieczorek added. \u201cWe need to prepare people to move out of those neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nHe recalled Richard Florida, the urbanist who years ago theorized about city cores radiating prosperity by cultivating a \u201ccreative class.\u201d When asked about Erie, Mr. Florida said that his thinking \u201chas evolved\u201d in light of increasing urban inequity.\n\n\u201cThe creative class can\u2019t mean only recruiting artists and people who work for tech companies,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has to include cultivating talent from within \u2014 immigrants, refugees, African-American communities.\u201d\n\nAt a raucous City Council meeting in February, advocates for the bridge loudly pleaded with the mayor while he stuck to his prepared remarks about tearing it down.\n\n\u201cWe have students who walk miles every day, through the snow because they don\u2019t own cars,\u201d said Gary Horton, who directs the Erie chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. and the E.F. Smith Quality of Life Learning Center on the city\u2019s East Side, where new immigrants learn English. \u201cThe viaduct doesn\u2019t seem important to people in City Hall. But for people looking to get ahead, it is not a side issue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about hope.\u201d\n\nImage Shawn Moffett, 24, made his way home from work as a snowstorm blanketed the viaduct.

That is why Sawsan Chebli, a Berlin state legislator with Palestinian heritage, recently came up with an idea that is radical even by the standards of a country that has dissected the horrors of its past like no other: make visits to Nazi concentration camps mandatory \u2014 for everyone.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThis is about who we are as a country,\u201d she said in a recent conversation in Berlin. \u201cWe need to make our history relevant for everyone: Germans who no longer feel a connection to the past and immigrants who feel excluded from the present.\u201d\n\nMs. Chebli\u2019s proposal comes at a time when Germany is grappling with the creeping rise of two kinds of anti-Semitism and as the Jewish community, now numbering about 200,000, is once again nervous.\n\nNeo-Nazis have been emboldened by the arrival of Alternative for Germany, the first far-right party to break into Parliament since World War II. And there are concerns that the recent absorption of more than a million immigrants, many from the Middle East and many Muslim, has inadvertently created incubators of a different kind of anti-Semitism \u2014 one hiding behind the injustices of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but often reverting to hateful old stereotypes, too.\n\nIt was the sight of Arab immigrants, including Palestinian-Germans like herself, burning an Israeli flag underneath the Brandenburg Gate in December while chanting \u201cDeath to Israel\u201d that moved Ms. Chebli to speak up.\n\nSince then, other disturbing stories have emerged in the German news media: an Afghan boy greeting his teacher with \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d and proclaiming that he, too, was Aryan. A group of Syrian refugees calling the Holocaust \u201ca Jewish conspiracy,\u201d explaining that they had learned that in school back home.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe reaction in Berlin, where there are strict legal prohibitions of Holocaust denial and Nazi propaganda, has been swift. The government announced that it was appointing its first-ever anti-Semitism coordinator. Some in Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservative party have urged the immediate deportation of anti-Semitic Muslims.\n\nG\u00fcnter Morsch, the director of the Sachsenhausen memorial, says he does not think that is helpful. \u201cWe cannot allow this debate to create another form of racism,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat about the Germans who are anti-Semitic?\u201d\n\nNine in 10 anti-Semitic hate crimes reported in Berlin are committed by German citizens. And for all the seeming contradictions, there is a common denominator between Muslims who espouse anti-Semitic views and those on the far-right (who also hate Muslims), Mr. Morsch said.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cAnti-Semitism correlates more closely with educational background than with ethnic background,\u201d he said, citing empirical studies.\n\nMs. Chebli says that visiting a concentration camp is no panacea, but that it can help. She visited one as a young woman. The experience changed her, she said.\n\n\u201cIt is a powerful way of keeping memory alive and giving meaning to our mantra of \u2018never again,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Chebli said. \u201cBut we need to get back to the essence of what this is about: It\u2019s about standing up for human rights and the rights of minorities \u2014 all minorities.\u201d\n\nMuslims, too\n\nDuring their visit to Sachsenhausen, the teenagers huddled around their guide in the vast triangular courtyard of the camp, its perimeter still dotted with watchtowers.\n\nSachsenhausen was no death camp, although tens of thousands of inmates are believed to have died here; those were built by the Nazis outside Germany. But it was the nerve center of two dozen major concentration camps run by the Nazis.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrom an inconspicuous office building in one corner of the camp, civil servants decided what kind of medical experiments would be conducted, how many executions would take place and how much Zyklon B gas would be delivered to the gas chambers in Auschwitz. \u201cDesk perpetrators,\u201d the guide, Mariana Aegerter, calls them.\n\n\u201cDoes anyone here know who was imprisoned here?\u201d she asked the class.\n\nNelson, a boy with shoulder-length hair, tentatively raised his hand. \u201cJews?\u201d\n\nThere were Jewish prisoners in Sachsenhausen. But unlike in the death camps, they were a minority. Of more than 200,000 inmates over the years, some 40,000 were Jewish. Many died here.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Nazi regime targeted many, Ms. Aegerter explained, like communists, clerics, homosexuals, Roma and the disabled. But also those considered \u201cantisocial\u201d: The homeless, the jobless, those on social welfare, and boys with long hair \u2014 Ms. Aegerter\u2019s eyes lingered on Nelson \u2014 or with too many girlfriends, or with a weakness for American music, like Jazz or swing.\n\nBy the time Sachsenhausen was liberated, she said, nine in 10 prisoners were foreigners, coming from 45 countries. There were Muslims, too.\n\n\u201cMuslims, too?\u201d Ferdous said later. \u201cI did not know that.\u201d\n\nBuilding bridges\n\nMs. Aegerter, a young historian, says her central aim during tours of the camp is to bring to life what is an empty space, to make students visualize life there, and ultimately to create a bridge between the visitor and the prisoner, between the present and the past.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Once, a Palestinian schoolgirl asked Ms. Aegerter, \u201cDon\u2019t you think that what the Jews are doing with the Palestinians today is the same as what the Nazis did with the Jews?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNo, she had explained, but that did not mean one had to approve of everything the state of Israel was doing. The girl seemed unconvinced.\n\nMs. Chebli comes across this all the time, she said. \u201cI have Palestinians tell me: I had to leave my country because of the Holocaust and you want me to worry about anti-Semitism?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nShe recounted the lukewarm reaction of one young man to her concerns about growing anti-Semitism. Born and raised in Germany, he does not see himself as German because, he says, Germans do not see him as German.\n\n\u201cOf course, anti-Semitism is important,\u201d he had told her, \u201cbut what about the racism I experience every day?\u201d\n\nTo win over young Muslims for the fight against anti-Semitism, Ms. Chebli said, Germany has to fight Islamophobia, too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much easier for me to persuade a young Muslim of the relevance of the Holocaust if I acknowledge their own experience of discrimination and create that link,\u201d Ms. Chebli said.\n\nSometimes, creating a link with young Germans is just as tricky, Ms. Aegerter points out.\n\nNow 34, she grew up in the eastern state of Brandenburg in the 1990s. Swastikas were a common sight in her town: Scrawled on the inside of toilet cubicles. Graffitied onto walls. A boy in her class had tattooed one on his shin. It was only after she and some friends had complained that the boy had been asked to wear long trousers during sports lessons.\n\nThese days, Ms. Aegerter has teachers on the phone who share their concerns about far-right tendencies among their students.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne teacher told her before a class visit that he had planned the trip specifically because he worried about three boys drifting into neo-Nazi territory. But on the day, all three called in sick.\n\n\u201cSadly, that is no exception,\u201d Ms. Aegerter said.\n\nIn some cases, she said, it is the parents telling teachers they do not want their children to visit a concentration camp.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen students do come, it can be transformative, said Mr. Morsch, who has been director of the memorial for 25 years.\n\n\u201cIt would be na\u00efve to expect a two-hour tour to turn neo-Nazis into anti-fascists,\u201d Mr. Morsch said. \u201cBut give us a little time, and we can achieve a lot.\u201d\n\nHe recalled a recent group of students from a vocational school that had a persistent problem with neo-Nazi graffiti. They spent several weeks in Sachsenhausen renovating one part of the memorial \u2014 but also working in small groups, dissecting drawings and letters of prisoners and creating their own exhibition.\n\n\u201cAfter they spend some time with us, the problem went away,\u201d Mr. Morsch said.\n\nMr. Morsch still believes that camp visits should remain voluntary. He fears an obligation to come would take away from the learning experience.\n\nMr. Hetzelein disagrees. Whether schools or the law make the call, students rarely get a say. He grew up in Bavaria, the only German state where visiting a Nazi memorial is already required.\n\nAs a high school student, he went to Dachau, near Munich. Years later, he saw Auschwitz, the Nazi death camp in what is Poland today.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe cast-iron gates, the barbed wire and the sheer scale of it still haunt him. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to read books about it,\u201d he said, \u201cyou need to feel it.\u201d\n\nA week after visiting Sachsenhausen, Mr. Hetzelein asked his students whether they thought their children should one day be made to visit a camp.\n\nOf 22 students, 21 agreed.

More than a decade ago he helped block the passage of a statewide needle-exchange program aimed at curbing the spread of H.I.V. from contaminated hypodermic needles, pitting himself against his own party.\n\nHis position on cannabis legalization not only puts him at odds with the governor and members of his party, but also with many African-Americans.\n\nIn New Jersey, African-Americans are three times more likely to be charged with marijuana possession than whites, even though both populations use the drug at similar rates. That has galvanized civil rights groups like the N.A.A.C.P. and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey to support legalization.\n\n\u201cAll the collateral consequences that come with an arrest \u2014 jail time, losing your job, losing your housing \u2014 are disproportionately falling on communities of color,\u201d said Dianna Houenou, a lawyer with the A.C.L.U. of New Jersey. \u201cThrough legalization we can begin to address the harms that have been inflicted.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA statewide coalition of black pastors, the N.A.A.C.P. and the New Jersey chapter of the Drug Policy Alliance is pushing for legalization as a social justice issue, but only if it is linked to some type of compensation for the harm they say was done to black and brown families whose sons were incarcerated. The pastors said they wanted to make sure members of their communities were able to participate in the billion-dollar cannabis industry as growers and sellers, not just workers. They are frustrated that the wealth being generated in the other states where marijuana is legal is not reaching people of color.\n\nResearchers at Marijuana Business Daily, an industry news site based in Denver, found that 81 percent of cannabis business owners were white, while less than 4 percent were black.\n\nMarijuana and racism have long been intertwined, dating back to the post-Prohibition era in the 1930s when the country\u2019s first drug czar gained traction for his war on marijuana by invoking a fear of black people. In the 1970s, President Richard Nixon\u2019s war on drugs targeted black people, as well as hippies.\n\n\u201cPoliticians and government officials used cannabis prohibition to target and criminalize black and brown people and throw them in jail,\u201d said Loretta Winters, president of the Gloucester County chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. \u201cWe demand that a huge piece of the business that this legislation will generate should make up for all the pain, suffering and loss of revenue that our black and brown communities have been subjected to.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAt a marijuana legalization forum held recently at Bethany Baptist Church in Newark, the Rev. Charles Boyer of Bethel A.M.E.

But it does not include any language discussing compensation.\n\nMr. Scutari agrees that arrests for marijuana possession are disproportionately higher for blacks and Latinos and says his bill addresses the issue of social justice.\n\n\u201cThe individuals that are previously convicted of marijuana possession will no longer be subject to prosecution,\u201d Mr. Scutari said.\n\nHe also said he was willing to consider other demands \u2014 but most likely in a separate bill. Mr. Scutari said any initial revenue from marijuana sales must first fund the state\u2019s program, including hiring staff, before paying for drug treatment, fixing the state\u2019s pension debt or building roads.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Rice has proposed his own marijuana bill that would decriminalize the possession of 10 grams or less of marijuana, and make carrying more a disorderly persons charge that would impose only a fine. It would also expunge criminal records and release incarcerated people serving sentences for possessing small amounts of marijuana. But Mr. Scutari said that decriminalization would simply create an open-air drug market that would allow drug dealers to get richer without creating any kind of regulatory system to control how marijuana is sold.\n\nUltimately, any effort to promote civil rights could depend on what kind of bill Mr. Murphy is willing to sign. In a statement, Daniel Bryan, a spokesman for the governor, said that Mr. Murphy was committed to \u201cthe goal of building a stronger and fairer New Jersey, and supports the legalization of marijuana to advance the cause of social justice and combat the racial disparities in our criminal justice system.\u201d", "keywords": ["social", "scutari", "racial", "cannabis", "justice", "bill", "legal", "drives", "fight", "mr", "pot", "legalization", "possession", "marijuana", "black", "drug", "jersey"], "polarity": 0.07900764201784606, "subjectivity": 0.4244901640309803},

But no more.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe was elected to Parliament from a safe district last year, after winning only a third of the vote in the presidential election, far worse than her supporters had hoped.\n\nAnd she has been nearly silent ever since. Far from constituting the principal opposition to President Emmanuel Macron, a promise she made last year, her voice in the National Assembly is inaudible. The influence of the Front\u2019s few parliamentary deputies is negligible. The party has virtually disappeared as a national force.\n\nThe party congress this weekend in Lille was intended, in part, to reverse this. Ms. Le Pen has received authorization to change the National Front\u2019s name, still associated with the party\u2019s founder, her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, and his years of Holocaust denial and association with Nazi collaborators.\n\nKicked out of the party by his daughter in 2015, Mr. Le Pen called a name change \u201csuicidal\u201d in a recent interview. For the first time since the Front was founded in 1972, he is not attending the party congress.\n\nMs. Le Pen has herself expressed ambivalence about continuing in the role of party president, and some party activists interviewed here also suggested the Front\u2019s future is not inevitably tied to the woman who inherited the leadership from her father.\n\n\u201cFor now we\u2019re with Marine Le Pen.

The show gave me the \u201cendorsement\u201d I had been craving all my (short) life.\n\n\u2014 Alex Gonzalez\n\nThe first time I saw myself on the big screen was when \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d came out and had Hattie McDaniel as the maid. I am 74 years old and I have seen a lot of racism in my life but \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d was the worst. It depicted a black women as a slave, who at the same time had power. At the time of the film I didn\u2019t really understand a lot about racism and the fact that I was a second-class person. A lot has changed, but a lot has not.\n\n\u2014 Gwendolyn Morgan\n\nI always liked \u201cIn the Heat of the Night\u201d because as a well-spoken, professional black man, I have found myself in Sidney Poitier\u2019s character\u2019s position: People can\u2019t figure me out.

They looked like people in my St. Albans and Jamaica, Queens, neighborhood.\n\n\u2014 DeBorah Palmer\n\nI remember watching \u201cMulan,\u201d which came out when I was in middle school, and absolutely freaking out.

I know it\u2019s not politically correct now, but this film mirrored the kindness, warmth and wisdom I received as a child from African-Americans who worked in our house.\n\n\u2014 Mavis Bryant\n\nAs a black South African, and an African in particular, I felt a deep sense of joy at how \u201cBlack Panther\u201d tried to portray African culture.

As someone adopted from China and raised in a predominantly white town, \u201cMulan\u201d was my premier exposure to Asian beauty and culture. Her story\u2019s message about turning adversity into strength sticks with me always.\n\n\u2014 MaiLei Meyers\n\nThe first time I saw gay men represented in film, who felt real and relatable, was in \u201cMy Beautiful Laundrette.\u201d Being gay isn\u2019t what the movie was about, these two characters just were, and that one was brown and the other white and working class made it even better.\n\n\u2014 Michael Ginther\n\n\u201cDrumline,\u201d featuring Nick Cannon, in 2002 and \u201cYou Got Served\u201d in 2004.

The closest thing to representation I saw was \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d but my family wasn\u2019t violent or in organized crime so I couldn\u2019t relate. I\u2019m still waiting to see characters like me.\n\n\u2014 Tiffany Magazzeni\n\nI\u2019m still waiting to see myself. I mean there is Michelle Yeoh, an Asian actress in the 1997 movie \u201cTomorrow Never Dies.\u201d She\u2019s not me, but I loved that her character defies the usual Hollywood stereotypes for Asians. But she is not American and I\u2019m not at all a Bond woman. I grew up watching movies and I love the old Hollywood movies especially, but it makes me sad to realize that Hollywood\u2019s portrayal of Asians has been mocking or missing for most of its history. Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan are also imports. There just aren\u2019t any homegrown Asian-American filmmakers yet.\n\n\u2014 Lillian Hsu\n\nI am an African-American man born in 1960, raised in Southern California. The first time I remember seeing someone who looked like me represented on screen in the way I saw myself was in 1967.

Through some common coming-of-age feelings of loneliness and confusion, but also in better understanding the differences, I learned more about myself.\n\n\u2014 Sally Otis\n\nAlthough I am white, I am Jewish with \u201cbig\u201d hair, raised in the Bronx. I saw myself reflected in \u201cFunny Girl.\u201d With a New York City backdrop, song lyrics and Barbra Streisand\u2019s delivery, I felt for the first time, in the eyes of the larger world, at age 12, accepted.\n\n\u2014 Jill Sager\n\nImage Diahann Carroll and Sidney Poitier in \"Paris Blues.\" Credit Kino Lorber\n\nI am 70 years old and watched classic Hollywood movies on television during the 1950s and \u201960s.

Amazing!\n\n\u2014 Donna Bailey\n\nThe first time I saw myself represented was in high school. Spike Lee made an all-black musical, \u201cSchool Daze,\u201d and I was in awe.

He argued that biological differences and not a lack of opportunity explained the shortage of women in leadership and technical positions.\n\nGoogle fired Mr. Damore. He filed a lawsuit in January with another former employee, claiming that the company discriminates against white men with conservative views. In a separate lawsuit, a former recruiter for YouTube sued Google because, he said, he was fired for resisting a mandate to hire only diverse \u2014 female or black and Latino \u2014 candidates.\n\nGoogle\u2019s handling of the issue was also upsetting to Mr. Damore\u2019s critics. In another lawsuit filed last month, a former Google employee said he was fired because he was too outspoken in advocating diversity and for spending too much time on \u201csocial activism.\u201d\n\nInside Google, vocal diversity proponents say they are the targets of a small group of employees who are sympathetic to Mr. Damore. In some cases, screenshots of comments made on an internal social network were leaked to online forums frequented by right-wing groups, which searched for and published personal information like home addresses and phone numbers of the Google employees, they said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2015, Google started an internal program called Respect@, which includes a way for employees to anonymously report complaints of inappropriate behavior by co-workers. Some diversity supporters say other employees are taking advantage of this program to accuse them of harassment for out-of-context statements.\n\n\u201cSome people feel threatened by movements that promote diversity and inclusion. They think it means people are going to come for their jobs,\u201d said Liz Fong-Jones, a Google engineer who is a vocal supporter of diversity.\n\nMany big tech companies are struggling with the challenge of creating a more diverse work force. In 2015, Facebook adopted the so-called Rooney Rule. Originally used by the National Football League to prod teams to consider coaching prospects who are black, the rule requires managers to interview candidates from underrepresented backgrounds for open positions. But last year, Facebook\u2019s female engineers said that gender bias was still a problem and that their work received more scrutiny than men\u2019s work.\n\nEven executives tasked with promoting diversity have had difficulties. In October, Denise Young Smith, who was Apple\u2019s vice president of inclusion and diversity, came under fire when she said that there was diversity even among 12 white, blue-eyed, blond men because they had different backgrounds and experiences. She later apologized, saying she did not intend to play down the importance of a non-homogenous work force. She left Apple in December.\n\nThe tension is elevated at Google, at least in part, by its workplace culture. Google has encouraged employees to express themselves and challenge one another. It provides many communication systems for people to discuss work and nonwork related issues. Even topics considered out of bounds at other workplaces \u2014 like sharp criticism of its own products \u2014 are discussed openly and celebrated.\n\nIn January, on one of Google\u2019s 90,000 \u201cgroups\u201d \u2014 internal email lists around a discussion topic \u2014 an employee urged colleagues to donate money to help pay Mr. Damore\u2019s legal fees from his lawsuit against Google to promote \u201cviewpoint diversity,\u201d according to a person who saw the posting but is not permitted to share the information publicly.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He said he had meant that being a Republican did not exempt Google employees from following the company\u2019s code of conduct.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA Google spokeswoman said in a statement that the company encouraged lively debate. But there are limits.\n\n\u201cCreating a more diverse workplace is a big challenge and a priority we\u2019ve been working to address. Some people won\u2019t agree with our approach, and they\u2019re free to express their disagreement,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Gina Scigliano. \u201cBut some conduct and discussion in the workplace crosses a line, and we don\u2019t tolerate it. We enforce strong policies, and work with affected employees, to ensure everyone can do their work free of harassment, discrimination and bullying.\u201d\n\nIn the past, discussions about diversity in Google\u2019s online chat groups would encounter skeptical but subtle comments or questions. The debate turned openly antagonistic after Mr. Damore\u2019s memo, which was titled \u201cGoogle\u2019s Ideological Echo Chamber.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe James Damore thing brought everything to a head,\u201d said Vicki Holland, a linguist who has worked at Google for seven years. \u201cIt brought everything to the surface where everyone could see it.\u201d\n\nMr. Damore said he began to question Google\u2019s diversity policies at a weekly company meeting last March. At the meeting, Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s vice president of people operations, \u201cpointed out and shamed\u201d departments in which women accounted for less than half the staff, according to Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe two female executives \u2014 who are among the company\u2019s highest-ranking women \u2014 said Google\u2019s \u201cracial and gender preferences were not up for debate,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Mr. Damore subsequently attended a \u201cDiversity and Inclusion Summit,\u201d where it reinforced his view that Google was \u201celevating political correctness over merit\u201d with its diversity measures.\n\nMr. Damore said he had written his memo afterward in response.\n\nMs. Scigliano, the Google spokeswoman, said the company looked forward to fighting Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit in court. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said in an August blog post that he had fired Mr. Damore because his memo advanced \u201charmful gender stereotypes\u201d but that \u201cmuch of the memo is fair to debate.\u201d\n\nSome employees said they were abstaining from internal debate on sensitive issues because they worried that their comments might be misconstrued or used against them. Like the broader internet, the conversations tend to be dominated by the loudest voices, they said.\n\nGoogle\u2019s diversity advocates said they would like to see more moderation on internal forums with officials stepping in to defuse tensions before conversations get out of hand. Ms. Miller, the Coworker.org co-director, said Google employees had expressed concern about how this would affect an internal culture rooted in transparency and free expression.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s on everyone\u2019s mind is: Has the culture been inextricably damaged by this environment?\u201d she said.", "keywords": ["google", "hard", "damore", "internal", "lawsuit", "employees", "work", "trying", "diversity", "googles", "diversify", "fired", "mr"], "polarity": 0.08552789802789805, "subjectivity": 0.3460065686628187},

Carmel, the Catholic church where the rally was held.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s welcome committee of a few hundred people, many dressed in the flag, gathered for what was part pep rally and part celebration of what they viewed as the fulfillment of a campaign promise: the construction of a wall to keep undocumented Mexican immigrants away.

Her husband, Scott, a retired construction worker, echoed her views. \u201cI think he\u2019s done great,\u201d he said. As Trump supporters in California, they said they were living in the state only to be close to their grandchildren.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t put a Trump sticker on your car,\u201d Ms. Horn said. \u201cYour car will get smashed.\u201d\n\nNot all of the faces at the rally were white. Kathy Robinson, who is African-American and from Burbank, and who works as a wedding photographer and Uber driver, voted in 2016 for Hillary Clinton. But after the election, she said she regretted that, and had come to view undocumented immigrants as a menace who take jobs away from American citizens. \u201cTrump is not racist,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s just against illegal immigrants. He loves black people.\u201d\n\nLater in the day, Mr. Trump addressed a hangar full of enthusiastic military service members at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar before attending a fund-raiser expected to raise $5 million at the home of Edward Glazer, a chairman of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump has stayed away from California until now, realizing that the state is beyond his reach in 2020 if he runs for re-election, as he says he will.

The border section he visited is currently guarded by a wire fence and sheet metal barrier, which local border patrol agents said have cut down on crossings since they were first put up. Mr. Trump argued that they need to be replaced by something more permanent and impenetrable. He expressed a preference for the models that have slats allowing border patrol officers to see through them.\n\nAs Mexicans watched from across the barrier, Mr. Trump described an epidemic of drugs and human traffickers that he has vowed to stop. He argued that building a wall would cost less than what he said was the price of social ills created by illegal immigration.\n\n\u201cWe need safety,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe need security at the border and we\u2019re getting it like we\u2019ve never had it before.

Conservatives were using the Trump administration\u2019s effort to rein in federal overreach to reverse policies designed to protect against what the Obama administration had seen as discriminatory practices.\n\nThe \u201cRethink Discipline,\u201d package that Mr. Trump\u2019s commission will examine includes guidance that the Obama administration issued on the legal limitations on the use of restraints and seclusion, corporal punishment and equity for special education students.\n\nIn recent months, educators and policy experts from across the country have traveled to Washington to voice support for and opposition to the disciplinary guidance, in private meetings with officials at the Education Department and in a series of public forums.\n\nAt a briefing hosted by the United States Commission on Civil Rights, dozens of policy experts, researchers, educators and parents sounded off on the Obama-era discipline policy in a meeting that became so racially charged that some black attendees walked out.\n\nSince the discipline guidelines were issued, conservatives have blamed the document for creating unsafe educational environments by pressuring schools to keep suspension numbers down to meet racial quotas, even if it meant ignoring troubling and criminal behavior. Teachers who sought suspensions or expulsions of minority students were painted as racists, conservatives maintained.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEvidence is mounting that efforts to fight the school-to-prison pipeline is creating a school climate catastrophe and has if anything put at-risk students at greater risk,\u201d said Max Eden, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, who argued that teacher bias was not the driving force behind school discipline.\n\nBut proponents argued that racial bias was well documented.\n\nWhen the guidance was issued, federal data found that African-American students without disabilities were more than three times as likely as their white peers without disabilities to be expelled or suspended, and that more than 50 percent of students who were involved in school-related arrests or who were referred to law enforcement were Hispanic or African-American.\n\n\u201cChildren\u2019s safety also includes protection from oppression and bigotry and injustice,\u201d Daniel J. Losen, director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies at the University of California at Los Angeles\u2019s Civil Rights Project, wrote in testimony to the Civil Rights Commission. \u201cFear-mongering and rhetoric that criminalizes youth of color, children from poor families and children with disabilities should not be tolerated.\u201d\n\nThe Education and Justice Departments wrote in a 2014 Dear Colleague letter that discipline disparities could be caused by a range of factors, but the statistics in the federal data \u201care not explained by more frequent or more serious misbehavior by students of color.\u201d The departments also noted that several civil rights investigations had verified that minority students were disciplined more harshly than their white peers for the same infractions.\n\n\u201cIn short, racial discrimination in school discipline is a real problem,\u201d the guidance said.\n\nIn recent months, Ms. DeVos has said change will be coming. She has already moved to rescind a regulation that protects against racial disparities in special education placements. Her goal, she said last month, was to be \u201csensitive to all of the parties involved.\u201d\n\nIn a bruising interview on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on Sunday, Ms. DeVos said that the disproportionate discipline issue \u201ccomes down to individual kids.\u201d She declined to say whether she believed that black students disciplined more harshly for the same infraction were the victims of institutional racism.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re studying it carefully and are committed to making sure students have opportunity to learn in safe and nurturing environments,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. DeVos\u2019s office for civil rights also announced that it would scale back the scope of investigations, reversing an approach taken under the Obama administration to conduct exhaustive reviews of school districts\u2019 practices and data when a discrimination complaint was filed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Ms. DeVos\u2019s own administration has continued to find racial disparities. In November, the Education Department found that the Loleta Union Elementary School District in California doled out harsher treatment to Native American students than their white peers. For example, a Native American student received a one-day out-of-school suspension for slapping another student on the way to the bus, in what was that student\u2019s first disciplinary referral of the year. A white student received lunch detention for slapping two students on the same day \u2014 the student\u2019s fifth and sixth referrals that year.\n\nWhile Mr. Cruz was repeatedly kicked out of class and ultimately expelled, it is unclear whether he was ever referred to the police for his behavior in school. However, Mr. Cruz was known to law enforcement, which never found cause to arrest him, and a report of troublesome behavior to the F.B.I. went unheeded.\n\nThe Broward County superintendent, Robert Runcie, said that Mr. Rubio\u2019s effort to connect the district\u2019s discipline policies to the Stoneman Douglas shooting was misguided.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to dismantle a program that\u2019s been successful in the district because of false information that someone has put out there,\u201d Mr. Runcie said on Twitter. \u201cWe will neither manage nor lead by rumors.\u201d", "keywords": ["education", "shootings", "school", "policies", "finds", "law", "discipline", "students", "guidance", "culprit", "rights", "program", "unlikely", "trump", "rubio", "mr", "obama"], "polarity": 0.05929752786895644, "subjectivity": 0.4110812996527283},

The elder Cruz speaks an Oaxacan language known as Valle (valley), as well as Zapotec, an indigenous language spoken by 400,000 people, which is recognized more frequently, according to Pamela Munro, a professor of linguistics at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nBecause a majority of the pelota mixteca players live in communities where Spanish or English are spoken rather than Zapotec, second-generation Oaxacan children are less likely to preserve that language or any of the other indigenous languages spoken during play .\n\n\u201cThey often shy away from speaking their indigenous language because of the legacy of racism, which forces them to sometimes hide and cloak their identities,\u201d said Rafael V\u00e1squez, 37, a scholar who is working on a book about Mexican ethnicity and multilingualism . \u201cWhen there\u2019s a safe space they often feel more free to speak in their native languages.\u201d\n\nMost of the men who play pelota mixteca are first-generation immigrants who were part of successive waves of Oaxacans who settled in and around Los Angeles beginning in the 1980s. Like Reynaldo Cruz, many of these people chose to live in Oaxacan communities.\n\nImage Jorge Cruz Jr., left, and Jorge Lopez Credit G L Askew II for The New York Times\n\nFor second-generation Oaxacan youths in the United States, speaking indigenous languages in school or public spaces is often met with sharp ridicule because of negative stereotypes from Mexican-Americans, the scholars said.\n\n\u201cMany Spanish speakers in Mexico are quite prejudice d against people who speak indigenous languages,\u201d Ms. Munro said. \u201cThe Spanish term indio (Indian) in Mexico is a highly prejudicial term, and a lot of that carries over to indigenous people in the U.S.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, some families believe that learning Spanish instead of their indigenous language provides more economic opportunities both in the U.S. and in Mexico, according to Mr. Vasquez.\n\nA number of Oaxacan youths are making efforts to \u201crevitalize\u201d these indigenous languages by playing sports like pelota mixteca and making frequent trips to Oaxaca. It provides an environment free from the stigma or the expectation to adopt Spanish.\n\nStill, pelota mixteca is far from a perfect game. And while most of the men are married and are doting husbands and fathers, the game reveals strong questions about the role of gender in the sport. Women are not on the field and if the men\u2019s wives attend the games, they often look after the children while their husbands play.\n\nSome of the players believe that women cannot handle the physical strain of the game, said Paula Mota, 25, a graduate student at California State University, Northridge, who has spent three years observing and researching this group of pelota mixteca players. But she added that there were some women\u2019s teams in Mexico.\n\nImage A glove and balls used in pelota mixteca.

At the same time, the widespread accessibility of social media has meant that it is a place where players can strategize about safe travel routes .\n\nPelota mixteca continues to be played in relative obscurity every Sunday , but a younger generation of players has appeared on the field. Mr. Cruz now brings his son Jorge, 15, and his nephew, Miguel Angel, 9, to the games with him every weekend, as his father once did more than 20 years ago.\n\nThe rally ended and the younger Jorge Cruz, walked off the field to take a break from the blazing San Fernando Valley heat. \u201cI feel empowered and excited that I\u2019m playing the same game that my ancestors did,\u201d he said while catching his breath. \u201cIf I have children one day, I\u2019m going to teach them this game, too, so that they don\u2019t lose our heritage.\u201d", "keywords": ["culture", "language", "sport", "alive", "pelota", "game", "oaxacan", "york", "mixteca", "cruz", "players", "jorge", "keeping", "indigenous"], "polarity": 0.07625170625170624, "subjectivity": 0.38048165048165056},

(We do not meet Perry or Don.) But who gets to \u201ccount\u201d as diverse is one of the play\u2019s horrible-hilarious wrangles. In an argument with Roberta, a member of Hillcrest\u2019s development staff, Sherri insists that the school\u2019s admissions catalog must depict a student body that is visually diverse \u2014 so Perry, who is light-skinned, doesn\u2019t count. To comply, Roberta (Ann McDonough) has to stage photos that feature recognizably dark-skinned students, reading \u201cThe Bluest Eye\u201d no less.\n\nPerry may not be black enough for the catalog, but Charlie certainly thinks he was black enough for Yale, and accepted for that reason. In an astonishing 17-minute howl of disappointment, he undoes a lifetime of indoctrination as he dissects the logical fallacies on which, he feels, his parents\u2019 values \u2014 and Yale\u2019s, and Hillcrest\u2019s \u2014 are based.\n\nPhoto\n\nIs Pen\u00e9lope Cruz a person of color?

Should white people hate white people?\n\nThe evening I saw it, this line of thought had the audience roaring and clapping and then seeming to want to retract both responses as Charlie veered into ever more uncomfortable ideas.\n\nThat\u2019s good satire at work, causing us to think critically about people we don\u2019t at first recognize as images of ourselves. And the discomfort only deepens when Charlie, stung by his parents\u2019 reaction to his tirade \u2014 his father calls him a spoiled brat \u2014 reconsiders his position and makes a startling decision.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Her assumptions of privilege, however unexamined, will not be denied. The crux of Mr. Harmon\u2019s argument, which is as tightly constructed as a finger-trap toy \u2014 almost every piece of information supplied at the start pays off by the end \u2014 is that hypocrisy may look a lot like love.\n\nSatires don\u2019t usually go there. Recent racial comedies, like Branden Jacobs-Jenkins\u2019s \u201cAn Octoroon\u201d and Bruce Norris\u2019s \u201cClybourne Park,\u201d have been built on ludicrously bad behavior, and let the results speak for themselves. \u201cAdmissions\u201d is less extreme but also, as a result, harder to put across. The characters are caught somewhere between well-observed types and absurd caricatures. Sherri\u2019s mama bear ferocity is necessary to turn the plot, just as Charlie\u2019s hysteria about Yale is, but in real life both would be subtler. Of course, in real life this plot wouldn\u2019t happen.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t happen onstage. As in his previous plays \u201cBad Jews\u201d and \u201cSignificant Other,\u201d Mr. Harmon is admirably unafraid of portraying incorrectness in the guise of sour comedy. In a way, Charlie is a combination of Daphna, the relentless scold of \u201cBad Jews,\u201d and Jordan, the whiny wallflower of \u201cSignificant Other.\u201d But \u201cAdmissions\u201d is even better for being about something substantially larger than one character\u2019s unhappiness.\n\nStill, I\u2019m not sure that Daniel Aukin\u2019s warm and intermittently rollicking production finds the right tone. Though there are moments in which the mere placement of bodies on the Newhouse\u2019s thrust stage is enough to make you anxious, there are too many others that seem to pull back from the blinding clarity that\u2019s needed. (Mark Barton\u2019s lighting is way too gentle.) When the actors, generally working in a naturalistic vein, tear into their characters\u2019 most unhinged moments they seem to be grinding gears.

Along with its byproduct, patis (fish sauce), it\u2019s an essential seasoning that claims a place on the table next to suka (vinegar) and banana ketchup (bananas cooked down in vinegar and tomato paste), as much a condiment as an ingredient.\n\nAs such, it\u2019s part of what the Manila-born food historian Doreen Fernandez termed a \u201cgalaxy of flavor-adjusters\u201d that define how Filipinos eat: seasonings added to dishes after they\u2019re served, in trickles and pinches, according to each diner\u2019s taste. A chef feeding Filipinos must sublimate ego and accept that no dish emerges from the kitchen fully finished. A meal is a joint effort between cooks and eaters.\n\nIF BAGOONG IS THE SALT, suka is the sour lifeblood of the cuisine. Extracted from sugar cane or the sap from coconut trees or nipa palms, it was originally a necessary preservative in a warm climate.\n\nHow to take the bounty of fish from the surrounding seas and make it last? Cure it in suka and it becomes kinilaw, an ancient recipe that may have been one of the earliest forms of ceviche. To this might be added the bite of ginger, the silkiness of coconut milk, or a sunny kiss of calamansi, which has a sharper sting than lime.\n\nFor another staple, daing na bangus, milkfish is relieved of its bones, splayed and soaked in vinegar overnight for tenderness, then crisped in a pan. You can eat the flesh with a spoon.\n\nPhoto\n\nLumpia, cousins to Chinese spring rolls, are dunked in sawsawan (dipping sauce), which may be as straightforward as vinegar with a stutter of raw garlic. The rolls come fried to a crackle or \u201cfresh,\u201d with uncooked, doughy skins that suggest crepes, and filled with anything from ground meat to hearts of palm to whole green finger chiles, a variation called, rightly, dynamite.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nVinegar is the undertow, too, in adobo, perhaps the best known of Filipino dishes, whose ingredients and method predate its Spanish name. (\u201cIt\u2019s really ours,\u201d said Romy Dorotan, the chef of Purple Yam in Brooklyn.) At its base, adobo is a long braise of meat in vinegar and garlic, but other ingredients are up for debate: Some swear by soy sauce while others dismiss it as an import; some stir in achuete oil (made from annatto seeds), coconut milk, sugar or squid ink.\n\nOf all Filipino dishes, adobo \u201chas the most leeway for a cook\u2019s imagination, hubris, art or bigoted sense of one\u2019s own mother\u2019s love-and-greatness,\u201d the novelist Gina Apostol said. There are nearly as many manifestations of adobo as there are Filipinos.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut is adobo the dish that speaks most directly to the Filipino soul? Ms. Fernandez argued otherwise, in favor of sinigang, a soup she described as \u201cthe dish most representative of Filipino taste,\u201d in part because it\u2019s adaptable \u201cto all classes and budgets.\u201d Recipes differ, but the goal is the same: a sourness so profound that the first sip should make you shudder.\n\n\u201cSinigang is what my mother would make for me when I was sick,\u201d said Alexandra Cuerdo, the director of the documentary \u201cUlam: Main Dish,\u201d about the rise of Filipino food in America, which is set to premiere at the San Francisco International Film Festival next month.\n\nThe souring agent in sinigang changes by the map: It might be tamarind, guava, alibangbang leaves, kamias (the fruit of the sorrel tree), batuan (kin to mangosteen) or unripe pineapple \u2014 whatever is on hand in the region. Place matters to Filipinos, who often have tangled roots as a result of internal migration and speak multiple languages.\n\nAt Lasa, the chef Chad Valencia uses rhubarb for sinigang when it\u2019s in season. \u201cOur region is Los Angeles,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nSTILL, NO ONE DISH can sum up the Filipino palate. \u201cA feast of different flavors is optimal,\u201d said Nicole Ponseca, who runs Maharlika and Jeepney in New York. \u201cSauces meld, complement, make whole.\u201d\n\nTo balance the sourness of adobo and sinigang, she suggests kare-kare, a nutty-sweet stew of oxtail, bok choy, string beans and eggplant, traditionally simmered with ground peanuts and achuete oil; peanut butter, a modern substitute, lends voluptuousness.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe history of kare-kare is often traced to a 20-month interregnum in the 18th century when the British wrested Manila from the Spanish. Indian cooks attending the Royal Navy brought the name and notion of curry to the islands, and had to make do with local spices.\n\nKare-kare, sinigang and adobo are likely to appear on most Filipino menus in the United States, from turo-turo (point-point) steam-table joints to sophisticated restaurants. So, too, is dinuguan, a pork-blood stew that can pose a challenge even for Filipinos.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWhen I was growing up, dinuguan was a kind of culinary boogeyman, a dish that adults would tell gory stories about to scare children,\u201d said Genevieve Villamora, one of the owners of Bad Saint.\n\nThe opaque stew, classically loaded with offal, is often passed off by Filipino immigrant parents as \u201cchocolate meat\u201d to their suspicious children. King Phojanakong, the chef of Kuma Inn in New York, remembers wondering, \u201cWhy was it so dark?\u201d\n\nBut the mineral-rich blood is what gives the stew its ballast and faintly metallic hint of a licked knife. It must be cooked carefully so that the blood doesn\u2019t congeal; done right, it turns to velvet. At Bad Saint, dinuguan has become one of the best-selling dishes, without the veil of euphemism.\n\nIF COOKING IS A VEHICLE for memory, for many Filipinos the dishes of their heritage are inseparable from days of celebration. \u201cFood marks the occasion,\u201d said Angela Dimayuga, who grew up in the Bay Area and was most recently the chef of Mission Chinese Food in New York.\n\nIt\u2019s considered particularly lucky to eat pancit (noodles) on birthdays, their uncut strands promising long life. The name of the noodles is derived from a Hokkien phrase for \u201cfast food.\u201d Like their Chinese antecedents, they come in different shapes and textures: miki (made with egg), bihon (rice), sotanghon (mung bean) and canton (wheat). Recipes might include sluices of soy sauce and calamansi and toppings of shrimp heads, quail eggs, shucked oysters or chicharron.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor the highest occasion \u2014 like Ms. Dimayuga\u2019s grandmother\u2019s 99th birthday last year \u2014 there can be only one centerpiece: lechon, whole roasted pig, its shining, lacquer-thin skin primed to shatter.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s trendy here to go head to tail, but there it\u2019s just a way of life,\u201d Mr. Phojanakong said. After a party, the lechon is broken down: \u201cYou use the head for sisig\u201d \u2014 a sizzle of jowl and ears \u2014 \u201ctrotters for adobo, make dinuguan with blood and innards and turn leftovers into paksiw,\u201d a vinegary stew contoured with a p\u00e2t\u00e9-like liver spread.\n\nThe backdrop to these dishes is always rice. Its earthy scent is the constant when you walk into a Filipino home, almost a ripening in the air. To Ms. Fernandez, rice was \u201cthe shaper of other foods,\u201d its soothing blandness allowing other dishes to be stronger in contrast.\n\nGlutinous rice is used, too, for kakanin, a genre of snacks that includes puto, little steamed cakes of ground rice and coconut milk, often accompanying dinuguan; suman, logs of sticky rice wrapped in banana leaves; and thick, gilded rounds of bibingka, perfumed with coconut and somehow fluffy and chewy at once.\n\nPhoto\n\nWheat, which came to the Philippines with the Spanish, also has its place in daily life. At any time of day, pan de sal, a simple bread roll, is nourishment. Isa Fabro, a pastry chef in Los Angeles, slakes hers in butter suffused with ube halaya (a jam of purple yam) and latik, a coconut-milk concentrate close in spirit to dulce de leche.\n\nSome popular desserts that have European origins are now thought of as wholly Filipino: wobbly leche flan, custard under a gooey drape of caramel; Sans Rival, a dacquoise-like palimpsest of cashews, meringue and buttercream, which the chef Nora Daza served in the 1970s at her Paris restaurant Aux Iles Philippines to the likes of Brigitte Bardot and Simone de Beauvoir; and mango royale, a crema de fruta turned icebox cake, with layers of cream and mangos teetering on overripe.\n\nBeyond these greatest hits are regional specialties, which Mr. Dorotan, a native of Bicol in southeastern Luzon, wishes would get more attention. At Purple Yam, he makes laing, taro leaves simmered in coconut milk (the trademark of Bicolano cooking) until lush.\n\nBut which regional specialties does he want to see more of? He laughed. There are so many islands.\n\n\u201cEven I do not know,\u201d he said.\n\nRecipes: Mango Royale | Oxtail Stew in Peanut Sauce (Kare-Kare) | Pork Sinigang\n\nFollow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

Arching over a gritty scrap-metal yard and railway line, the graffiti-scrawled 1,170-foot-long bridge links two of this city\u2019s poorest neighborhoods.\n\nImage\n\nWhen the viaduct opened in the late 1930s, the city was growing. The bridge, renovated in the 1970s, was an emblem of local pride and progress. It funneled traffic through what were at the time thriving neighborhoods.\n\nThen the factories started disappearing. The viaduct\u2019s largely German, Polish and Irish district became home to increasing numbers of blacks, Latinos and refugees from Africa and the Middle East, whose arrivals have slowed the city\u2019s population decline.\n\nOn one level, the story of the bridge is a microcosm of America\u2019s crumbling infrastructure. Questions about where to spend the city\u2019s limited resources touch on familiar themes about the failures of urban renewal and today\u2019s widening income gap.\n\nAt the same time, the debate over the fate of a decaying relic of midcentury industrial architecture has focused a particular spotlight on Erie\u2019s legacy of disenfranchisement and its troubled race relations.\n\nImage Mary Whalen prayed before the noon Mass at St. Anne's Church just north of the viaduct. The viaduct is named for a former pastor of the church, Msgr. Lawrence McBride, who campaigned for its construction after a child was killed crossing the tracks.

Using national census data, the news organization 24/7 Wall Street found that 47 percent of the city\u2019s black population lives at or below the national poverty line, twice the rate for African-Americans nationally and more than four times the rate for whites in Erie.\n\nAfter the ranking was published in November, The Erie Times-News took issue with some of the survey\u2019s numbers, but not the gist. Median income for black residents in the city languishes at around half that of white residents; the unemployment rate is more than triple the national average.\n\nAnd City Hall is perceived by many black residents as an enclave of white privilege.\n\n\u201cThis city spends a huge amount to pay for police to incarcerate people from our community,\u201d said Cee Williams, a former Erie County poet laureate. There are only eight minority police officers of the 173 officers employed by the city.\n\n\u201cHow about spending some of that money on fixing the bridge,\u201d Mr. Williams said, suggesting that such an approach \u201cmight help change the lives of kids who end up costing the public a fortune in prison.\u201d\n\nImage Police officers responded to a domestic disturbance call at a home in the lower east side of Erie, during a winter storm that caused widespread power failures.

Lately, students from Gannon University, on the other side of Erie, have adopted it as a hangout and cause \u2014 a miniature untapped version of New York\u2019s repurposed rail tracks known as the High Line. Local teenagers use it as a de facto elevated park, for lack of green space.\n\nMore than a few, like Ms. Feliciano, walk or bike across it because, as she said, \u201cit\u2019s still the safest, shortest route\u201d over the tracks. It is better, they contend, than the pedestrian path, with its dangerous street crossing, along a busy expressway that the city built a block away.\n\nOne city block may not seem far. But to those who have to walk it, it can seem like another unfair burden that some in the community have been forced to bear. Unlike the expressway, the viaduct \u201cgoes where we want to go,\u201d Ms. Feliciano said.\n\nLandscape architects have a poetic term for this. They call it a desire line.\n\nStill, Erie officials are poised to tear the bridge down, insisting the cost of its repair and maintenance is simply prohibitive. They say only a clique of preservationists really cares about saving the viaduct, noting that residents from the neighborhood rarely showed up at public meetings over the years to support it.\n\nImage Taquanta Gray and Noel Remigio at home with their daughter, Nivea, 2, and dog, Blue. Ms. Gray said she used the bridge regularly to visit her parents and extended family. The loss of the bridge would mean a longer, more perilous commute for the family, she said. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\n\u201cThe reason black people weren\u2019t showing up at public meetings to talk about the viaduct is that they have lost hope,\u201d said Shantel Hilliard, longtime executive director of the Booker T. Washington Center. \u201cWhy bother when things here never change?\u201d\n\nAlso called the East Avenue Bridge, the viaduct opened in 1938. A Catholic pastor in the neighborhood, Msgr. Lawrence McBride of St. Ann\u2019s Church, campaigned for the bridge after a child was killed trying to cross the tracks.\n\nFor decades, the span fed thousands of pedestrians, cars and trucks onto East Avenue, the area\u2019s main street. But it was shut to traffic almost eight years ago, after officials had poured some $180 million into the expressway over the tracks, called the Bayfront Connector, which was completed in 2005. The Bayfront Connector was, in essence, an old-fashioned traffic engineer\u2019s vision of urban renewal, with all the predictable results.\n\nThe expressway sped suburbanites in their cars in and out of Erie. But it cleaved a struggling inner-city district, cutting off homes from schools, devastating East Avenue businesses, turning neighborhood streets into dead ends and deflating already-low housing values, while encouraging crime on some of those dead-end streets.\n\nThe city\u2019s new mayor, Joe Schember, had barely moved into City Hall in January before announcing his determination to tear the old bridge down \u201cas quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nMr. Schember, a Democrat, acknowledged the expressway\u2019s ill consequences, and even brought up that damning report about Erie and its black population.\n\nImage Kamarion Barney, 13, walked home from school over the McBride Viaduct. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\nBut after consulting some of the same city and state engineers who devised the connector, he concluded that the McBride bridge was no longer safe or needed, and that it might cost some $6 million to fix, more than he believes this straitened city can afford.\n\nPreservationists angrily reject the mayor\u2019s figures, conjecturing a far lower cost to keep the bridge open just for pedestrians and bikes. They point to a new $5 increase in vehicle registration fees that promises Erie an additional $1.4 million a year for infrastructure improvements, a fund that could help pay to fix the bridge.\n\n\u201cWe have serious problems on the east side,\u201d Mr. Schember said. \u201cIf the city is going to put money to work there, there are much more worthwhile things to spend it on than the viaduct.\u201d\n\nHe has yet to spell those things out. In place of the viaduct, the city has been contemplating larger parking lots.\n\nFor East Side residents \u2014 many of whom cannot afford cars and who often take their lives into their hands dashing on foot across the multilane expressway, scrambling over its concrete Jersey barriers to get home or to the neighborhood Walmart \u2014 the viaduct remains not just a way to get where they are going. It is a measure of where the city is headed.\n\nImage From left, Traivyon Spencer, 3, Kiahra Moffett, 11, and Shalee Spencer, 12, hopped over several concrete barricades to cross the Bayfront Connector on their way home after school.

Anthony Harris, who oversees the largely black congregation at Shiloh Baptist Church, near the viaduct.\n\nMayor Schember has lately promised new, safer pedestrian crossings along the connector and improvements to the expressway\u2019s pedestrian path over the tracks. With funds having already been allocated for the viaduct\u2019s demolition, he said, acting expeditiously on the low bid by an out-of-town firm called Swank may throw off \u201cadditional resources\u201d for \u201cbeautifying that area, for which we will seek resident input,\u201d he said.\n\nThe mayor has in the meantime endorsed Erie Refocused, a comprehensive plan he inherited from the previous administration that was never carried out. Among other things, it calls for improved community engagement, public spaces and streets geared more toward pedestrians and bikes.\n\nThese are precisely the arguments for fixing the viaduct, preservationists say.\n\nImage A gate where people can gain access and cross the train tracks through the grounds of scrap yards and industrial businesses.

His grandfather was a second-generation Polish-American who settled on the east side and worked for General Electric, where Mr. Wieczorek\u2019s father also worked, before the company drastically downsized.\n\nMr. Wieczorek has two young children, lives on the West Side, and endorses the idea of investing in downtown and along the waterfront, to attract more businesses and tourists, not in what he called \u201cfailing neighborhoods\u201d on the east side.\n\n\u201cI cannot find the type of housing, with neighbors I would want to live with, on the east side,\u201d Mr. Wieczorek added. \u201cWe need to prepare people to move out of those neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nHe recalled Richard Florida, the urbanist who years ago theorized about city cores radiating prosperity by cultivating a \u201ccreative class.\u201d When asked about Erie, Mr. Florida said that his thinking \u201chas evolved\u201d in light of increasing urban inequity.\n\n\u201cThe creative class can\u2019t mean only recruiting artists and people who work for tech companies,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has to include cultivating talent from within \u2014 immigrants, refugees, African-American communities.\u201d\n\nAt a raucous City Council meeting in February, advocates for the bridge loudly pleaded with the mayor while he stuck to his prepared remarks about tearing it down.\n\n\u201cWe have students who walk miles every day, through the snow because they don\u2019t own cars,\u201d said Gary Horton, who directs the Erie chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. and the E.F. Smith Quality of Life Learning Center on the city\u2019s East Side, where new immigrants learn English. \u201cThe viaduct doesn\u2019t seem important to people in City Hall. But for people looking to get ahead, it is not a side issue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about hope.\u201d\n\nImage Shawn Moffett, 24, made his way home from work as a snowstorm blanketed the viaduct.

More than a decade ago he helped block the passage of a statewide needle-exchange program aimed at curbing the spread of H.I.V. from contaminated hypodermic needles, pitting himself against his own party.\n\nHis position on cannabis legalization not only puts him at odds with the governor and members of his party, but also with many African-Americans.\n\nIn New Jersey, African-Americans are three times more likely to be charged with marijuana possession than whites, even though both populations use the drug at similar rates. That has galvanized civil rights groups like the N.A.A.C.P. and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey to support legalization.\n\n\u201cAll the collateral consequences that come with an arrest \u2014 jail time, losing your job, losing your housing \u2014 are disproportionately falling on communities of color,\u201d said Dianna Houenou, a lawyer with the A.C.L.U. of New Jersey. \u201cThrough legalization we can begin to address the harms that have been inflicted.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA statewide coalition of black pastors, the N.A.A.C.P. and the New Jersey chapter of the Drug Policy Alliance is pushing for legalization as a social justice issue, but only if it is linked to some type of compensation for the harm they say was done to black and brown families whose sons were incarcerated. The pastors said they wanted to make sure members of their communities were able to participate in the billion-dollar cannabis industry as growers and sellers, not just workers. They are frustrated that the wealth being generated in the other states where marijuana is legal is not reaching people of color.\n\nResearchers at Marijuana Business Daily, an industry news site based in Denver, found that 81 percent of cannabis business owners were white, while less than 4 percent were black.\n\nMarijuana and racism have long been intertwined, dating back to the post-Prohibition era in the 1930s when the country\u2019s first drug czar gained traction for his war on marijuana by invoking a fear of black people. In the 1970s, President Richard Nixon\u2019s war on drugs targeted black people, as well as hippies.\n\n\u201cPoliticians and government officials used cannabis prohibition to target and criminalize black and brown people and throw them in jail,\u201d said Loretta Winters, president of the Gloucester County chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. \u201cWe demand that a huge piece of the business that this legislation will generate should make up for all the pain, suffering and loss of revenue that our black and brown communities have been subjected to.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAt a marijuana legalization forum held recently at Bethany Baptist Church in Newark, the Rev. Charles Boyer of Bethel A.M.E.

But it does not include any language discussing compensation.\n\nMr. Scutari agrees that arrests for marijuana possession are disproportionately higher for blacks and Latinos and says his bill addresses the issue of social justice.\n\n\u201cThe individuals that are previously convicted of marijuana possession will no longer be subject to prosecution,\u201d Mr. Scutari said.\n\nHe also said he was willing to consider other demands \u2014 but most likely in a separate bill. Mr. Scutari said any initial revenue from marijuana sales must first fund the state\u2019s program, including hiring staff, before paying for drug treatment, fixing the state\u2019s pension debt or building roads.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Rice has proposed his own marijuana bill that would decriminalize the possession of 10 grams or less of marijuana, and make carrying more a disorderly persons charge that would impose only a fine. It would also expunge criminal records and release incarcerated people serving sentences for possessing small amounts of marijuana. But Mr. Scutari said that decriminalization would simply create an open-air drug market that would allow drug dealers to get richer without creating any kind of regulatory system to control how marijuana is sold.\n\nUltimately, any effort to promote civil rights could depend on what kind of bill Mr. Murphy is willing to sign. In a statement, Daniel Bryan, a spokesman for the governor, said that Mr. Murphy was committed to \u201cthe goal of building a stronger and fairer New Jersey, and supports the legalization of marijuana to advance the cause of social justice and combat the racial disparities in our criminal justice system.\u201d", "keywords": ["social", "scutari", "racial", "cannabis", "justice", "bill", "legal", "drives", "fight", "mr", "pot", "legalization", "possession", "marijuana", "black", "drug", "jersey"], "polarity": 0.07900764201784606, "subjectivity": 0.4244901640309803},

I\u2019m still waiting to see characters like me.\n\n\u2014 Tiffany Magazzeni\n\nI\u2019m still waiting to see myself. I mean there is Michelle Yeoh, an Asian actress in the 1997 movie \u201cTomorrow Never Dies.\u201d She\u2019s not me, but I loved that her character defies the usual Hollywood stereotypes for Asians. But she is not American and I\u2019m not at all a Bond woman. I grew up watching movies and I love the old Hollywood movies especially, but it makes me sad to realize that Hollywood\u2019s portrayal of Asians has been mocking or missing for most of its history. Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan are also imports.

He argued that biological differences and not a lack of opportunity explained the shortage of women in leadership and technical positions.\n\nGoogle fired Mr. Damore. He filed a lawsuit in January with another former employee, claiming that the company discriminates against white men with conservative views. In a separate lawsuit, a former recruiter for YouTube sued Google because, he said, he was fired for resisting a mandate to hire only diverse \u2014 female or black and Latino \u2014 candidates.\n\nGoogle\u2019s handling of the issue was also upsetting to Mr. Damore\u2019s critics. In another lawsuit filed last month, a former Google employee said he was fired because he was too outspoken in advocating diversity and for spending too much time on \u201csocial activism.\u201d\n\nInside Google, vocal diversity proponents say they are the targets of a small group of employees who are sympathetic to Mr. Damore. In some cases, screenshots of comments made on an internal social network were leaked to online forums frequented by right-wing groups, which searched for and published personal information like home addresses and phone numbers of the Google employees, they said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2015, Google started an internal program called Respect@, which includes a way for employees to anonymously report complaints of inappropriate behavior by co-workers. Some diversity supporters say other employees are taking advantage of this program to accuse them of harassment for out-of-context statements.\n\n\u201cSome people feel threatened by movements that promote diversity and inclusion. They think it means people are going to come for their jobs,\u201d said Liz Fong-Jones, a Google engineer who is a vocal supporter of diversity.\n\nMany big tech companies are struggling with the challenge of creating a more diverse work force. In 2015, Facebook adopted the so-called Rooney Rule. Originally used by the National Football League to prod teams to consider coaching prospects who are black, the rule requires managers to interview candidates from underrepresented backgrounds for open positions. But last year, Facebook\u2019s female engineers said that gender bias was still a problem and that their work received more scrutiny than men\u2019s work.\n\nEven executives tasked with promoting diversity have had difficulties. In October, Denise Young Smith, who was Apple\u2019s vice president of inclusion and diversity, came under fire when she said that there was diversity even among 12 white, blue-eyed, blond men because they had different backgrounds and experiences. She later apologized, saying she did not intend to play down the importance of a non-homogenous work force. She left Apple in December.\n\nThe tension is elevated at Google, at least in part, by its workplace culture. Google has encouraged employees to express themselves and challenge one another. It provides many communication systems for people to discuss work and nonwork related issues. Even topics considered out of bounds at other workplaces \u2014 like sharp criticism of its own products \u2014 are discussed openly and celebrated.\n\nIn January, on one of Google\u2019s 90,000 \u201cgroups\u201d \u2014 internal email lists around a discussion topic \u2014 an employee urged colleagues to donate money to help pay Mr. Damore\u2019s legal fees from his lawsuit against Google to promote \u201cviewpoint diversity,\u201d according to a person who saw the posting but is not permitted to share the information publicly.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He said he had meant that being a Republican did not exempt Google employees from following the company\u2019s code of conduct.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA Google spokeswoman said in a statement that the company encouraged lively debate. But there are limits.\n\n\u201cCreating a more diverse workplace is a big challenge and a priority we\u2019ve been working to address. Some people won\u2019t agree with our approach, and they\u2019re free to express their disagreement,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Gina Scigliano. \u201cBut some conduct and discussion in the workplace crosses a line, and we don\u2019t tolerate it. We enforce strong policies, and work with affected employees, to ensure everyone can do their work free of harassment, discrimination and bullying.\u201d\n\nIn the past, discussions about diversity in Google\u2019s online chat groups would encounter skeptical but subtle comments or questions. The debate turned openly antagonistic after Mr. Damore\u2019s memo, which was titled \u201cGoogle\u2019s Ideological Echo Chamber.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe James Damore thing brought everything to a head,\u201d said Vicki Holland, a linguist who has worked at Google for seven years. \u201cIt brought everything to the surface where everyone could see it.\u201d\n\nMr. Damore said he began to question Google\u2019s diversity policies at a weekly company meeting last March. At the meeting, Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s vice president of people operations, \u201cpointed out and shamed\u201d departments in which women accounted for less than half the staff, according to Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe two female executives \u2014 who are among the company\u2019s highest-ranking women \u2014 said Google\u2019s \u201cracial and gender preferences were not up for debate,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Mr. Damore subsequently attended a \u201cDiversity and Inclusion Summit,\u201d where it reinforced his view that Google was \u201celevating political correctness over merit\u201d with its diversity measures.\n\nMr. Damore said he had written his memo afterward in response.\n\nMs. Scigliano, the Google spokeswoman, said the company looked forward to fighting Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit in court. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said in an August blog post that he had fired Mr. Damore because his memo advanced \u201charmful gender stereotypes\u201d but that \u201cmuch of the memo is fair to debate.\u201d\n\nSome employees said they were abstaining from internal debate on sensitive issues because they worried that their comments might be misconstrued or used against them. Like the broader internet, the conversations tend to be dominated by the loudest voices, they said.\n\nGoogle\u2019s diversity advocates said they would like to see more moderation on internal forums with officials stepping in to defuse tensions before conversations get out of hand. Ms. Miller, the Coworker.org co-director, said Google employees had expressed concern about how this would affect an internal culture rooted in transparency and free expression.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s on everyone\u2019s mind is: Has the culture been inextricably damaged by this environment?\u201d she said.", "keywords": ["google", "hard", "damore", "internal", "lawsuit", "employees", "work", "trying", "diversity", "googles", "diversify", "fired", "mr"], "polarity": 0.08552789802789805, "subjectivity": 0.3460065686628187},

Mr. Washington died in prison in April 2000. Mr. Bottom, also known as Jalil Abdul Muntaqim, is still in prison at the Sullivan Correctional Facility in Fallsburg, N.Y., officials said.\n\nIn a statement condemning the decision, Commissioner James P. O\u2019Neill recalled how Mr. Bell and his co-conspirators \u201cshot Officer Piagentini 22 times, including with his own service revolver \u2014 as the dying officer pleaded for his own life.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cOver the past 47 years, he has never expressed genuine remorse,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Neill said.\n\nIn a letter the parole board sent to Mr. Bell this week, however, they credited him with finally taking responsibility \u201cfor your actions\u201d and expressing \u201cregret and remorse for your crimes.\u201d Noting this maturation, the board quoted back to Mr. Bell what he told panelists during their interview of him on March 3: \u201cThere was nothing political about the act, as much as I thought at the time,\u201d Mr. Bell told them. \u201cIt was murder and horribly wrong.\u201d\n\nThe board undertook a deep review of several factors, including Mr. Bell\u2019s age, scant disciplinary history in prison and his success in compiling a \u201csturdy network of supporters,\u201d including the Prisoner Reentry Institute at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. In the end, a majority of panelists found that the state had prepared Mr. Bell well for release.

And as the police officers told you, that\u2019s a judgment that needs to be made by a trained person. Still, the events you describe strongly suggest that your tenant has reached this point, and that it\u2019s more important to take care of him than to respect his demands to be left alone.\n\nYou have two rather different sets of concerns here. One is for your building and your family: Your tenant\u2019s condition poses a risk of serious harm to both. The other is for your tenant: You have good evidence that he shouldn\u2019t be left alone, for the sake of his health and his well-being. If his interests and yours pulled in opposite directions, you might face a hard choice. But they don\u2019t. The first set of concerns gives you moral standing to intervene. Unless his relative accepts responsibility for him, the fact that she disagrees is, morally speaking, neither here nor there. Given that you do have standing, you should then aim to do what is best for him and, as it happens, for you. It would be both prudent and caring to explore getting him into a place where he can be properly looked after.\n\nA college friend invited me to stay with him when I returned to my hometown after a long absence. He lives alone in a househe inherited. The bed linens were clean, and the bathroom was clean, but there were dust, cobwebs and clutter all over the house, and the whole place needed a good cleaning, painting and replacement of flooring. He said he was trying to downsize, but the living room was filled with sheets, books, pans.

He invited you in, you say, and your bedroom and bathroom were fine. Still, I\u2019ll grant that what you describe would seem consistent with conditions like depression or even compulsive hoarding. Aside from his cluttered and untidy home, did he seem to be socially isolated or impeded in major life activities?\n\nAssuming that he does have a serious problem, it doesn\u2019t sound as if you have a close-enough relationship with this man to intervene effectively from a distance. Do you know of friends or relatives who are in a position to do more? If you think you\u2019re the only person who has noticed and is in a position to do anything, you might help your friend simply by letting him know that the condition of his house has made you wonder whether he has a problem.

She never heard how they felt about being photographed or the story behind their jewelry; instead, you heard the \u201cvoice of the institution,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI wanted to become a photographer because of National Geographic,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to tell a different story.\u201d\n\nModern news organizations still lag in minority representation on photography staffs, said Brent Lewis, a senior photo editor at ESPN\u2019s The Undefeated. Mr. Lewis praised National Geographic\u2019s overall effort, but said he was disappointed that the cover \u2014 the most recognizable image for an issue dedicated to race \u2014 was shot by a white man, Robin Hammond.\n\nMs. Goldberg said the main feature story featured nine photographers, five of whom were people of color. Of the eight writers, four were people of color.\n\n\u201cWe cover a diverse world,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we want to do so accurately and with authority, we need a diverse staff to cover it.\u201d\n\nThe magazine\u2019s self-reflection was among the most direct admissions of past sins from media organizations, which have occasionally wrestled with their complicity in injustices.\n\nIn 2004, The Lexington Herald-Leader in Kentucky published a front-page \u201cclarification\u201d to atone for its civil rights coverage 50 years earlier.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt has come to the editor\u2019s attention that The Herald-Leader neglected to cover the civil rights movement,\u201d it read. \u201cWe regret the omission.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, The Courier-Journal in Louisville, Ky., apologized for continuing to refer to Muhammad Ali, the famed boxer, as Cassius Clay for years after he changed his name in 1964.

Wear it as a badge of honor.\u201d\n\nOn the face of it, Bannon\u2019s advice is strange. After all, by any normative understanding, \u201cracist,\u201d \u201cxenophobe\u201d and \u201cnativist\u201d are negative words from both a moral and rational point of view. Their definitions, taken from any standard dictionary, will bear this out. Racism, xenophobia and nativism embody, in their very meanings, both irrationality and unfairness. Irrationality is considered to be a negative quality (except perhaps by Dadaists); so is unfairness.\n\nFor those of us to wish to understand the way Bannon is manipulating language here, and to what end, it is important to note what he is not doing. It is typical for far-right politicians who want to attract racist, xenophobic or nativist voters to attempt to provide at least the pretense of reasons, invariably shoddy ones, for animus against racial minorities, immigrants, or foreigners.\n\nIn the United States, President Trump regularly connects individual crimes or criminal gangs with immigration in an effort to more broadly establish a link between immigrants with crime in the public consciousness. Though studies have shown that immigrants, both legal and illegal, are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans, Trump continues to make such claims (his statement that immigrants bring \u201ctremendous amounts of crime\u201d received a score of \u201cfour Pinocchios\u201d from fact-checkers).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSimilarly bizarre false claims are made by non-American far-right politicians, who also regularly engage in anti-Semitic innuendo. There is a natural next step to using innuendo and the manufacturing of reasons to justify racism and xenophobia \u2014 namely to drop the facade altogether. Bannon is urging the adoption of an irrational bias against racial minorities, immigrants and foreigners, one that does not require reasons, even bad ones, to support it. And he recommends presenting such irrationality as virtuous.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

But taking Bannon\u2019s advice also requires rejecting any recognizable practice of giving plausible reasons for holding a view or position.

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/12/opinion/devos-school-prison-pipeline.html", "text": "Photo\n\nOn Sunday evening, CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d broadcast an interview that Lesley Stahl conducted with Betsy DeVos, Donald Trump\u2019s education secretary and one of the richest members of his very rich cabinet. It was overwhelmingly seen as a disaster for DeVos, who struggled to answer very basic questions. She couldn\u2019t say, for example, why schools in Michigan, her home state, have largely gotten worse since the widespread introduction of the school choice policies she lobbied for. When Stahl asked whether, as secretary, she\u2019d ever visited a failing school to find out what went wrong, DeVos said, \u201cI have not intentionally visited schools that are underperforming.\u201d\n\nLike many things in Trump\u2019s administration, this performance was shocking but not surprising. Before becoming secretary of education, DeVos had never worked as an educator or a policymaker; she was a donor to education reform efforts favored by the right, such as school choice and vouchers. Her confirmation hearings last year were an embarrassment. She appeared to be unfamiliar with the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, a federal civil rights law. After taking office, she described historically black universities and colleges, founded in response to segregation, as \u201cpioneers when it comes to school choice.\u201d\n\nAs this comment suggested, DeVos is, at best, oblivious about race. That obliviousness \u2014 or worse \u2014 is behind one of the more disturbing moments in her \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview. In a sick irony, some on the right would use the recent school shooting in Parkland, Fla. \u2014 allegedly committed by a young man who carved swastikas into the magazines for his semiautomatic rifle \u2014 as a pretext to roll back civil rights protections for students of color. On \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d DeVos, whom Trump has chosen to lead his new school safety commission, appeared to signal she\u2019s on board.\n\nTo understand how, we need to start with a letter that Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, sent to DeVos and Attorney General Jeff Sessions on March 5 about the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRubio referred to a 2014 Barack Obama-era directive, known as the Dear Colleague Letter on the Nondiscriminatory Administration of School Discipline, intended to address the so-called school-to-prison pipeline, in which disadvantaged students are funneled into the criminal justice system for misbehaving at school. The Dear Colleague Letter said school personnel must \u201cunderstand that they, rather than school resource officers and other security or law enforcement personnel, are responsible for administering routine student discipline.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

Ann Coulter made a similar argument in a column published in Breitbart: \u201cCruz\u2019s criminal acts were intentionally ignored by law enforcement on account of Broward\u2019s much-celebrated \u2018school-to-prison pipeline\u2019 reforms.\u201d", "keywords": ["education", "school", "letter", "expand", "law", "york", "secretary", "betsy", "sign", "schooltoprison", "60", "minutes", "pipeline", "devos"], "polarity": 0.03899602335648848, "subjectivity": 0.48572963857847584},

About 100 readers responded. Here are a selection of them, lightly edited for clarity and length.\n\n\u201cThe Brothers Garcia\u201d on Nickelodeon. It was my happiest TV day ever! The family on TV looked and acted very much like mine, and everybody at school loved it! The show gave me the \u201cendorsement\u201d I had been craving all my (short) life.\n\n\u2014 Alex Gonzalez\n\nThe first time I saw myself on the big screen was when \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d came out and had Hattie McDaniel as the maid. I am 74 years old and I have seen a lot of racism in my life but \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d was the worst. It depicted a black women as a slave, who at the same time had power. At the time of the film I didn\u2019t really understand a lot about racism and the fact that I was a second-class person. A lot has changed, but a lot has not.\n\n\u2014 Gwendolyn Morgan\n\nI always liked \u201cIn the Heat of the Night\u201d because as a well-spoken, professional black man, I have found myself in Sidney Poitier\u2019s character\u2019s position: People can\u2019t figure me out.

They looked like people in my St. Albans and Jamaica, Queens, neighborhood.\n\n\u2014 DeBorah Palmer\n\nI remember watching \u201cMulan,\u201d which came out when I was in middle school, and absolutely freaking out. I\u2019m not Chinese; I\u2019m Korean and was adopted by a white family as a baby, but in a media landscape that still largely excludes people of East Asian descent, I\u2019ll celebrate what I can get.\n\n\u2014 Amanda McClendon\n\nI\u2019m a white woman. Moira Shearer in \u201cRed Shoes.\u201d I was perhaps 8 years old. I grew up in a small town in North Texas.

I know it\u2019s not politically correct now, but this film mirrored the kindness, warmth and wisdom I received as a child from African-Americans who worked in our house.\n\n\u2014 Mavis Bryant\n\nAs a black South African, and an African in particular, I felt a deep sense of joy at how \u201cBlack Panther\u201d tried to portray African culture. For once, Africans were good people in a movie, although it was fictional.\n\n\u2014 Khalifah Makgotlho\n\nThe 1972 film \u201cBlack Girl,\u201d starring Peggy Pettit as an aspiring modern dancer.

As someone adopted from China and raised in a predominantly white town, \u201cMulan\u201d was my premier exposure to Asian beauty and culture. Her story\u2019s message about turning adversity into strength sticks with me always.\n\n\u2014 MaiLei Meyers\n\nThe first time I saw gay men represented in film, who felt real and relatable, was in \u201cMy Beautiful Laundrette.\u201d Being gay isn\u2019t what the movie was about, these two characters just were, and that one was brown and the other white and working class made it even better.\n\n\u2014 Michael Ginther\n\n\u201cDrumline,\u201d featuring Nick Cannon, in 2002 and \u201cYou Got Served\u201d in 2004.

I believe that this constant social navigation is ripe for exploration.\n\n\u2014 India Lovato\n\nIn 1988, I saw \u201cThe Milagro Beanfield War.\u201d Most of the characters were Mexican and they were just portrayed as people, not some \u201cFrito Bandito\u201d joke. It made me want to cry with relief.\n\n\u2014 Dawn Reed\n\nGrowing up Italian and plus-size, I never saw women like me in the movies. The closest thing to representation I saw was \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d but my family wasn\u2019t violent or in organized crime so I couldn\u2019t relate. I\u2019m still waiting to see characters like me.\n\n\u2014 Tiffany Magazzeni\n\nI\u2019m still waiting to see myself. I mean there is Michelle Yeoh, an Asian actress in the 1997 movie \u201cTomorrow Never Dies.\u201d She\u2019s not me, but I loved that her character defies the usual Hollywood stereotypes for Asians. But she is not American and I\u2019m not at all a Bond woman. I grew up watching movies and I love the old Hollywood movies especially, but it makes me sad to realize that Hollywood\u2019s portrayal of Asians has been mocking or missing for most of its history. Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan are also imports. There just aren\u2019t any homegrown Asian-American filmmakers yet.\n\n\u2014 Lillian Hsu\n\nI am an African-American man born in 1960, raised in Southern California. The first time I remember seeing someone who looked like me represented on screen in the way I saw myself was in 1967.

Through some common coming-of-age feelings of loneliness and confusion, but also in better understanding the differences, I learned more about myself.\n\n\u2014 Sally Otis\n\nAlthough I am white, I am Jewish with \u201cbig\u201d hair, raised in the Bronx. I saw myself reflected in \u201cFunny Girl.\u201d With a New York City backdrop, song lyrics and Barbra Streisand\u2019s delivery, I felt for the first time, in the eyes of the larger world, at age 12, accepted.\n\n\u2014 Jill Sager\n\nImage Diahann Carroll and Sidney Poitier in \"Paris Blues.\" Credit Kino Lorber\n\nI am 70 years old and watched classic Hollywood movies on television during the 1950s and \u201960s.

He argued that biological differences and not a lack of opportunity explained the shortage of women in leadership and technical positions.\n\nGoogle fired Mr. Damore. He filed a lawsuit in January with another former employee, claiming that the company discriminates against white men with conservative views. In a separate lawsuit, a former recruiter for YouTube sued Google because, he said, he was fired for resisting a mandate to hire only diverse \u2014 female or black and Latino \u2014 candidates.\n\nGoogle\u2019s handling of the issue was also upsetting to Mr. Damore\u2019s critics. In another lawsuit filed last month, a former Google employee said he was fired because he was too outspoken in advocating diversity and for spending too much time on \u201csocial activism.\u201d\n\nInside Google, vocal diversity proponents say they are the targets of a small group of employees who are sympathetic to Mr. Damore. In some cases, screenshots of comments made on an internal social network were leaked to online forums frequented by right-wing groups, which searched for and published personal information like home addresses and phone numbers of the Google employees, they said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2015, Google started an internal program called Respect@, which includes a way for employees to anonymously report complaints of inappropriate behavior by co-workers. Some diversity supporters say other employees are taking advantage of this program to accuse them of harassment for out-of-context statements.\n\n\u201cSome people feel threatened by movements that promote diversity and inclusion. They think it means people are going to come for their jobs,\u201d said Liz Fong-Jones, a Google engineer who is a vocal supporter of diversity.\n\nMany big tech companies are struggling with the challenge of creating a more diverse work force. In 2015, Facebook adopted the so-called Rooney Rule. Originally used by the National Football League to prod teams to consider coaching prospects who are black, the rule requires managers to interview candidates from underrepresented backgrounds for open positions. But last year, Facebook\u2019s female engineers said that gender bias was still a problem and that their work received more scrutiny than men\u2019s work.\n\nEven executives tasked with promoting diversity have had difficulties. In October, Denise Young Smith, who was Apple\u2019s vice president of inclusion and diversity, came under fire when she said that there was diversity even among 12 white, blue-eyed, blond men because they had different backgrounds and experiences. She later apologized, saying she did not intend to play down the importance of a non-homogenous work force. She left Apple in December.\n\nThe tension is elevated at Google, at least in part, by its workplace culture. Google has encouraged employees to express themselves and challenge one another. It provides many communication systems for people to discuss work and nonwork related issues. Even topics considered out of bounds at other workplaces \u2014 like sharp criticism of its own products \u2014 are discussed openly and celebrated.\n\nIn January, on one of Google\u2019s 90,000 \u201cgroups\u201d \u2014 internal email lists around a discussion topic \u2014 an employee urged colleagues to donate money to help pay Mr. Damore\u2019s legal fees from his lawsuit against Google to promote \u201cviewpoint diversity,\u201d according to a person who saw the posting but is not permitted to share the information publicly.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He said he had meant that being a Republican did not exempt Google employees from following the company\u2019s code of conduct.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA Google spokeswoman said in a statement that the company encouraged lively debate. But there are limits.\n\n\u201cCreating a more diverse workplace is a big challenge and a priority we\u2019ve been working to address. Some people won\u2019t agree with our approach, and they\u2019re free to express their disagreement,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Gina Scigliano. \u201cBut some conduct and discussion in the workplace crosses a line, and we don\u2019t tolerate it. We enforce strong policies, and work with affected employees, to ensure everyone can do their work free of harassment, discrimination and bullying.\u201d\n\nIn the past, discussions about diversity in Google\u2019s online chat groups would encounter skeptical but subtle comments or questions. The debate turned openly antagonistic after Mr. Damore\u2019s memo, which was titled \u201cGoogle\u2019s Ideological Echo Chamber.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe James Damore thing brought everything to a head,\u201d said Vicki Holland, a linguist who has worked at Google for seven years. \u201cIt brought everything to the surface where everyone could see it.\u201d\n\nMr. Damore said he began to question Google\u2019s diversity policies at a weekly company meeting last March. At the meeting, Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s vice president of people operations, \u201cpointed out and shamed\u201d departments in which women accounted for less than half the staff, according to Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe two female executives \u2014 who are among the company\u2019s highest-ranking women \u2014 said Google\u2019s \u201cracial and gender preferences were not up for debate,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Mr. Damore subsequently attended a \u201cDiversity and Inclusion Summit,\u201d where it reinforced his view that Google was \u201celevating political correctness over merit\u201d with its diversity measures.\n\nMr. Damore said he had written his memo afterward in response.\n\nMs. Scigliano, the Google spokeswoman, said the company looked forward to fighting Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit in court. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said in an August blog post that he had fired Mr. Damore because his memo advanced \u201charmful gender stereotypes\u201d but that \u201cmuch of the memo is fair to debate.\u201d\n\nSome employees said they were abstaining from internal debate on sensitive issues because they worried that their comments might be misconstrued or used against them.

The Baptist part is inherited, like baldness or dimples: Both of my grandfathers and three of my uncles were Baptist preachers, and my parents met as graduate students at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Genes aside, the church \u2014 plastic chairs, pilling carpet and grape juice for communion \u2014 was the organizing institution of my childhood, where I met my closest friends and most of the significant adults in my life.\n\nChurch attendance has been in generational decline. I began calling around, exploring whether people in small towns were looking for community elsewhere and, with the white nationalist rallies so often in the news, whether young white people were looking for meaning in the grim sanctuaries of the alt-right.\n\nBut I kept hearing about something different. Pastors, theologians and sociologists were talking of how black worshipers were leaving white-majority churches. They were leaving quietly and not en masse, a family here, a single person there. But it was happening everywhere, a movement large enough for some to see the unraveling of decades of efforts at racial reconciliation.\n\nI would find someone on Facebook, a black worshiper who had posted about leaving her mostly white church, and then I would find someone in the same situation halfway across the country. They would both think they were going through this alone, yet the accounts would be remarkably similar, the timelines nearly identical, even some of the words and phrases the same. There had been, I discovered, some sharp reporting about this, particularly from the writer Deborah Jian Lee, but not as much as you would expect for an experience that seemed to be this broadly shared.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPeople spoke to me of being tired, let down, heartbroken. Political and cultural partitions that they had long overlooked at worship time now overshadowed every service. The realizations almost always began with the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012, and a sense that white church leaders or fellow worshipers did not want to talk about how a black teenager walking home from a 7-Eleven could end up dead. Sometimes the preacher would privately express sympathy, but also concern about how his white congregation would take it.

Progress is less about understanding and liking each other and more about smashing structures that others defend.\n\nThe second thing that happened was that reason, apparently, ceased to matter. Today\u2019s young people were raised within an educational ideology that taught them that individual reason and emotion were less important than perspectivism \u2014 what perspective you bring as a white man, a black woman, a transgender Mexican, or whatever.\n\nThese students were raised with the idea that individual reason is downstream from group identity.

The powerful few keep everyone else down. The solutions to injustice and suffering are simple and obvious: Defeat the powerful.

Their hope was that by sharing their stories they could start dialogues and inspire change.\n\nI could identify; I knew what it was like to sometimes feel like an outsider. And as an editor at The Times, I wondered what I could do to advance the conversation.\n\nAn answer came as I was researching an obit for a woman in the tennis world. I discovered the story of Mary Ewing Outerbridge when I stumbled upon a website crediting her with introducing tennis to America. I wondered if she had received a Times obituary when she died in 1886. I checked our digital newspaper archives. She had not.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter that, anytime I came across an interesting person who died years ago, I searched our archives for an obit. Those who didn\u2019t get one were, not surprisingly, largely women and people of color. I started talking about my research with colleagues, friends and relatives, all of whom began sending me more names.\n\nI soon had a list of dozens of fascinating people, such as Ms. Larsen; Madhubala, a Bollywood actress whose poetically tragic life was cut short; and Margaret Abbott, a golfer who died without ever knowing that she was the first American woman to win an Olympic championship.\n\nEven more surprising were some blatant omissions of those who had achieved a measure of fame in their lifetime, like the poet Sylvia Plath, the writer Charlotte Bront\u00eb and the photographer Diane Arbus.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t they get obits? I can only speculate. Perhaps the mark they made on the world wasn\u2019t recognized until decades after their deaths. Or maybe some of them faded into obscurity, their achievements forgotten. It could be that The Times didn\u2019t learn about their deaths until it was too late. Or that the omission was more purposeful, a judgment call of an editor who didn\u2019t deem the death newsworthy.\n\nRegardless, I now had an opportunity to give these women their due.\n\nIn November 2017, I met Jessica Bennett, The Times\u2019s first gender editor. She agreed that Overlooked was a compelling way to add to the record, and we decided to partner up.\n\nWhat followed was a whirlwind of excitement in the newsroom, with writers, editors, international correspondents, page designers, photo editors \u2014 whether they were women, men, people of color or not \u2014 asking us how they could contribute. Dozens of people have played a meaningful role in making it come together.\n\nBecause many of the subjects we wrote about died long ago, we decided to diverge from the traditional obituary style of announcing a person\u2019s death at the start of the article. Instead, we encouraged writers to be creative with their storytelling.\n\nThis series is just the beginning.

We also do our own homework: We investigate, research and ask around before settling on our subjects.\n\nSome might think our process presumptuous. Who, after all, anointed a handful of Times editors to stand by the roadside as a parade of humanity passes and single out this one, this one \u2014 but not that one \u2014 as worthy of being remembered?\n\nThe answer is that no one did, actually, because that is not precisely what we decide. We make no judgments, moral or otherwise, about human worth. What we do try to judge, however, is newsworthiness, and that\u2019s a whole other standard.\n\nPhoto\n\nThere is no formula, scoring system or checklist. But we do hold to certain criteria, slippery as they may be. Fame, of the widespread kind, will usually get someone past the velvet ropes. Accomplishment, with wide impact, matters as much, and it often goes hand in hand with fame.\n\nBut achievement may also speak softly. Eugene Goldwasser, to name one subject among 1,195 Times obits in 2010, was a largely unsung biochemist whose 20-year pursuit of an elusive protein led to the development of a widely used anemia drug that became one of the biggest products of the biotechnology industry.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWangari Maathai was a Kenyan environmentalist who began a movement to reforest her country by paying poor women a few shillings to plant trees. She might have died in 2011 largely unknown to the wider world had she not become the first African woman to win a Nobel Peace Prize seven years before.\n\nSometimes we choose a subject in part to represent a group whose contributions were forgotten or ignored. Violet Cowden, who also died in 2011, comes to mind: She helped ferry supplies for American troops in World War II as a member of the stateside Women Airforce Service Pilots.\n\nFor every person we decide to write about there are innumerable others we decide against. Fame and accomplishment are relative; the public eye is easily distracted, and only a moment or two in its fickle gaze may not be enough to merit a backward look in The Times.\n\nThe same might be said of a sparkling r\u00e9sum\u00e9. The best schools, a successful corporate climb, charitable good works and distinguished service awards are impressive and laudable, but not necessarily newsworthy to a global audience.\n\nOne thing to remember is that it is not our intent to honor the dead; we leave the tributes to the eulogists. We seek only to report deaths and to sum up lives, illuminating why, in our judgment, those lives were significant. The justification for the obituary is in the story it tells.\n\nMany readers legitimately ask: Why are the vast majority of our obituary subjects white men? The answer lies in our not-so-distant history.\n\nUnlike the rest of the newsroom, the obituaries desk covers the past, not the present. Our pages mirror the world of 1975 or 1965 or 1955, or even earlier: They\u2019re a rearview mirror, reflecting the world as it was, not as it is, and not as we might wish it to have been.\n\nAnd so we are, inevitably, a generation or three behind in tracking the evolution of gender and racial dynamics, among other things. The prominent shapers of society back then, those who held (and didn\u2019t easily give up) the levers of power, were disproportionately white and male, be they former United States senators or business titans or Hollywood directors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith Overlooked, our new collection of obituaries for women and others who never got them, The Times is acknowledging that many worthy subjects were skipped for generations, for whatever reasons.\n\nConscious or unconscious bias? Could be. Perhaps my predecessors and I were never informed of the deaths. Maybe those who knew the deceased did not think we\u2019d be interested. Maybe an editor passed for lack of interest, or maybe considered an obit but did not have a reporter available to write it. (A practical reality that bedevils us today.)\n\nPerhaps the significance of an individual portrayed in Overlooked was not fully recognized until decades after her death. Or perhaps the paper\u2019s selection standards in eras past unfairly valued the achievements of the white, male mainstream over those of minorities and women who may have been more on the margins.\n\nI\u2019d like to think that those portrayed in Overlooked would be prime candidates for an obit in The Times today \u2014 precisely because they fit a broader standard of significance and impact and, by the way, offer compelling stories.\n\nSo why not more women and people of color on the obituary pages? (Why, for that matter, not more openly gay people, or transgender people?)\n\nThe larger answer: Because relatively few of them were allowed to make such a mark on society in their own time. Universities may have barred them. Businesses and political parties may have shut them out. The tables of power were crowded with white men; there were few seats for anyone else.\n\nThere were, of course, women who crashed glass ceilings, blacks and Native Americans and people of Asian heritage who pushed through \u201cwhites only\u201d barriers. And their stories have been told in the obituary pages over many decades.\n\nNo doubt, we\u2019ll see more of them in the years to come.

Sarah Laskow of The Atlantic explained in 2014 that philosophers at this time were, in the words of the sociologist Karl Mannheim, \u201canxious to find a general law to express the rhythm of historical development, based on the biological law of the limited lifetimes of man.\u201d /But understanding societal phenomena through the lens of groups of people born around the same time has always had its limits.\n\nFor example, it\u2019s true that for young men coming-of-age during the Vietnam War, being born in a particular year (and, thanks to the draft lottery, on a particular day) could be life-shaping. But even here, an individual\u2019s class was a factor in whether he actually went to war \u2014 men from privileged backgrounds had many options to avoid the draft, the burden of which fell mainly on the working class.\n\nLike war service, entering the labor market at a time of recession, as most millennials did, can be difficult. But race and class are more important in affecting how this experience plays out for individuals.\n\nTake white millennial college graduates: Yes, they\u2019re part of an age cohort that has experienced worse economic conditions than graduates of the preceding generation \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t give us a particularly meaningful understanding of their plight, given that they are still better off when it comes to income than the average non-college-educated worker of any age.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome may argue that the generation game, if intellectually vacuous, is basically harmless. But dividing society by generation obscures the real and enduring lines of race, class and gender. When, for example, baby boomers are blamed for \u201cruining America,\u201d the argument lumps together Donald Trump and a 60-year-old black woman who works for minimum wage cleaning one of his hotels.\n\nThe pattern of inherited privilege points to yet another reality that the generation game ignores: the decline of social mobility between generations and the rise of what the French economist Thomas Piketty has called a \u201cpatrimonial society.\u201d When it comes to wealth and its accompanying privileges, the wealth of the previous generation of one\u2019s own family matter more than whether your birth year falls on one or other side of some arbitrary boundary.\n\nToday\u2019s young people may choose political action aimed at reversing these trends or to let them continue and accelerate.

Many Germans and Swedes now recognize \u2014 and some celebrate \u2014 the fact that their fellow citizens can have any skin color or religion. But the attempt to turn countries with monoethnic identities into truly multiethnic nations is a historically unique experiment, and so it should hardly come as a surprise that it has encountered some fierce resistance.\n\nThe situation in Canada and the United States, despite their histories as countries of immigration, has important similarities to that in Europe. Both have historically had rigid racial hierarchies. And in recent decades, both have made real steps toward overcoming these injustices: African-Americans, for example, are better represented in business and government than at any previous point in American history. This has made opposition to a more equal, multiethnic society more fervid among those who feel their privileges threatened. There is a sizable number of Americans for whom the idea of the nation remains synonymous with whiteness and Christianity.\n\nSo long as nationalism is associated with one particular ethnic or religious group, it will serve to exclude and disadvantage others. The only way to keep the destructive potential of nationalism in check is to fight for a society in which collective identity transcends ethnic and religious boundaries \u2014 one in which citizens from all religious or ethnic backgrounds are treated with the same respect as citizens from the majority group.\n\nTo effect this transformation is one of the great political challenges of our age. It requires principled resistance to right-wing nationalism, but it can succeed only if those who are most open to diversity abandon their hostility to other forms of nationalism.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

But for better or probably worse, it\u2019s easier to be moved by the suffering of people with whom we have some form of kinship. That is why nationalism remains one of the most powerful vehicles for expanding our circle of sympathy.\n\nAnother common reaction to the resurgence of nationalism has been to celebrate more narrow forms of collective identity, such as race or religion. At a time when many minority groups are under attack, it is, of course, crucial to defend them against discrimination. But it is also important to remember that such groups, too, are capable of oppressing their own members, for example by enforcing restrictive moral codes. That\u2019s why the only way to allow individuals true freedom to lead their lives is to preserve some form of political identity independent of the interests of particular cultural groups.\n\nConvinced that they would be unable to redirect nationalism toward their own ends, many of the most open-minded segments of society long ago gave up on the fight to determine its meaning. In countries like Germany and the United States, advocacy for the victims of prejudice has increasingly bled into a belief that the dark chapters of those countries\u2019 history make any form of nationalism deeply suspect. Instead of exhorting their fellow citizens to live up to their nations\u2019 highest ideals, many activists seem content with denouncing past and present injustices. This has allowed the bigots and racists to bend the meaning of the nation to their own sinister ends.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s time to fight back.

Barack Obama has been an especially persuasive advocate of the idea that Americans should focus on what unites rather than what divides us and that the symbolism of the nation can inspire hope, even as we reckon with the injustices of American history. \u201cWhat greater expression of faith in the American experiment than this,\u201d Mr. Obama marveled as he stood on the spot in Selma, Ala. where civil rights protesters were beaten in 1965. \u201cWhat greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished, that we are strong enough to be self-critical, that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is in our power to remake this nation to more closely align with our highest ideals?\u201d\n\nCampaigning for France\u2019s presidency last year, Emmanuel Macron expressed inclusive patriotism in an even more explicit form. \u201cI see Armenians, Italians, Algerians, Moroccans, Tunisians,\u201d he said at a rally in Marseille, a diverse city in southern France, \u201cBut what do I see? I see the people of Marseille! What do I see? I see the people of France!\u201d This, he added in an explicit repudiation of the exclusive nationalism propagated by the far-right National Front party, \u201cis what it means to be proud to be French!\u201d\n\nAmerican \u2014 and to a lesser degree European \u2014 political culture is pregnant with the symbols of inclusive patriotism. But while we have plenty of history to build on, we must also recognize that we are fighting to establish a kind of society for which there is no clear precedent.\n\nIn the United States, the model had once been a melting pot. But asking individuals to conform to one unified culture puts the price of admission to the nation too high. In Canada, the model is often said to be that of a salad bowl, in which the overall dish is enriched by the great variety of individual ingredients. But we can now see that this may be an overly idealized image of a society in which people feel that they have little in common across ethnic and religious divides.\n\nThere may not be a perfect culinary metaphor for the kind of country inclusive nationalists seek to create. But its contours should be obvious. It is a state in which all members have the same rights and opportunities irrespective of the group into which they are born or the culture to which they belong. It is a society in which people feel that they have something important in common because they seek to govern themselves together, pledge to help one another in an hour of need and recognize that these shared commitments are ultimately more consequential than any difference of color or creed. And it is a culture that does not shy away from celebrating the nobility of this collective identity \u2014 embracing the nation\u2019s flag not because we claim never to have failed our compatriots in the past but because we aspire to realize a common future fair to all.\n\nIt would be tempting to say that this kind of patriotism has little in common with the nationalism that is now ascendant around the world. Patriotism, some philosophers argue, should be understood as an innocent love of country that is inclusive at home and cooperative abroad. Nationalism, by contrast, excludes other ethnicities and stands in competition with the interests of other countries.\n\nBut it is too clever by half to pretend that we can safely stoke the good aspects of patriotism without ever running the danger of exacerbating the worst aspects of nationalism. For the kind of patriotism I am proposing is not a completely different form of collective identity; it is, rather, one that proudly stands in competition with the exclusionary politics on display from Washington to Moscow to Beijing.\n\nNationalism is like a half-wild beast. As long as it remains under our control, it can be of tremendous use. But if we abandon it, others are sure to step in, prodding and baiting the beast to bring out its most ferocious side. For all the well-founded misgivings about it, we have little choice but to domesticate it as best we can.", "keywords": ["identity", "form", "nation", "liberals", "political", "patriotism", "common", "reclaim", "society", "religious", "collective", "nationalism"], "polarity": 0.14129125602529854, "subjectivity": 0.47932204517310895},

The powerful message was that this black man and his white fianc\u00e9e were facing her family (and the world) and saying that was O.K. I think it was the first time I thought to myself: Love trumps color, race, culture, and even fear.\n\n\u2014 Vanessa Ricot, project manager, marketing\n\nMy mother was American and my father Colombian, and Lucy and Ricky on \u201cI love Lucy\u201d were the first ethnically mixed, semi-bilingual couple I had seen on TV. The show, which I saw reruns of as a child in the 1980s, introduced ideas like culture clash; it lightly made fun of American cluelessness about other countries, in the figures of Fred and Ethel.\n\nA comic genius, Lucy used slapstick and crocodile tears to combat her husband\u2019s machismo \u2014 and when you look at how Latina actors in her position are still forced to play stereotypes of the docile wife or the sexy spitfire, that still looks radical today.\n\n\u2014 Annie Correal, reporter, metropolitan news\n\nI am not athletic, British or Indian. But Parminder Nagra, who played Jess Bhamra in \u201cBend it Like Beckham,\u201d was close enough. She loved her traditional brown family, but she was fiercely independent and a talented soccer player. She even nabbed the hot (white) boyfriend over the Keira Knightley character. She was everything the tween in me wanted the chance to be.\n\n\u2014 Fahima Haque, editor, social media\n\nI didn\u2019t see myself in someone who looked particularly like me, but rather in someone who matched my passion for the performing arts.

Those were also the years when the \u201cmodel minority\u201d myth was really grating me, and I was drawn to transgressive portrayals of Asians. Jon Moritsugu\u2019s movies, in all their anarchic glory, were a revelation, especially \u201cTerminal U.S.A.,\u201d which somehow made it onto TV in the 1990s despite all its gore and drug use.\n\nLater, Justin Lin\u2019s \u201cBetter Luck Tomorrow\u201d depicted a group of Asian-American high-school students who fall into a world of crime. These are not the greatest movies ever made, but they meant a lot to me because they ignored the standard immigrant-experience formula and seemed to say: \u201cYeah, we\u2019re Asian.

It\u2019s hard enough finding movies about queer women or about Asian-American women, so seeing both identities woven together in one film was incredible. Fourteen years after the movie came out, it remains alone at the center of such a Venn diagram of underrepresentation.\n\n\u2014 Kathy Zhang, analytics manager\n\nI was so excited in kindergarten to see a free-spirited, brown woman running around and calling the shots in \u201cPocahontas.\u201d I repeatedly watched the videotape, and my mother let me grow my hair down, like Pocahontas.

I was a black kid who played sports, and I looked up to athletes: Tito Trinidad, Ronaldo, Michael Johnson, Thierry Henry and Roy Jones Jr. These men of color were the best at what they did, and they wore their excellence and their beauty unflinchingly.

{"title": "\n                    New Y.A. Books by Women of Color Rewrite Old Cultural Scripts                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/books/review/ya-women-of-color-clayton-adeyemi.html", "text": "Now, more than anytime in recent history, we\u2019re hearing the triumphant roar of women of color as they break down longstanding barriers in art, film and literature. In young adult literature in particular, inventive, international stories told in newly empowered women\u2019s voices are claiming their rightful place at the table. Take these five new Y.A. books, ranging from fantasy to realistic fiction to memoir. In these authors\u2019 hands, non-Western sensibilities might reign in a vivid and original Yoruban religion-based world, or classical settings might be reinterpreted to create a universe in which beauty is not tied to race. A heartbreaking fictional front row seat to the Syrian refugee emergency is offset by a humorous true tale of growing up an Iranian-American immigrant without a green card. And a very modern romance proves that, despite divides both cultural and digital, love still wins. So do Y.A. readers, when it comes to seeing exhilaratingly new kinds of characters sharing space.\n\nIn Dhonielle Clayton\u2019s lavish fantasy THE BELLES (Freeform, $17.99; ages 14 to 17), a thing of beauty is only temporary. The decadent island society of Orl\u00e9ans is home to a select group of sisters born with the disconcerting ability to perform plastic surgery without the plastic. As \u201cdescendants of the goddess of beauty,\u201d the Belles have a fuzzily explained magical \u201carcana\u201d in their blood that allows them to temporarily change the physical appearance of the native Gris, who are cursed with gray skin and red eyes. After a childhood of training, the teenage Belles are introduced to upper-class society and tasked with transforming the hair, skin and bone structure of the race-fluid rich and royal. But when the rebellious Belle Camellia uncovers a plot by the truly vile Princess Sophia to enslave her and her sisters, she sows the seeds of a grass-roots revolution that is bound to blossom more fully in the inevitable sequel.\n\nPhoto\n\nClayton, a co-founder of the We Need Diverse Books organization, has created an opulent mash-up setting, which seems to be a cherry-picked combination of 18th-century France, Japan and the antebellum American South. If it never quite coalesces into a seamless cultural whole, readers seduced by the page-turning palace intrigue and the vivid food and clothing descriptions won\u2019t notice or care.\n\nMagic also lies dormant in the platelets of chosen teenagers in the Nigerian-American Tomi Adeyemi\u2019s debut, CHILDREN OF BLOOD AND BONE (Holt, $18.99; ages 12 and up). But these diviners are no debutantes. Born with snow white hair and deep brown skin in the imaginary country of Or\u00efsha, young diviners morph into mighty, magic-wielding maji, or magicians, at 13. For centuries they relied on their powers (which Adeyemi based on aspects of the religion of the Yoruban people of West Africa). All that ended when the nonmagical King Saran ordered the slaughter of all adult majis. But when a mysterious scroll falls into the hands of Amari, a defiant princess, and Z\u00e9lie, a tenacious diviner warrior, the two young women set out on a thrilling, death-defying journey to restore magic and take back the throne.\n\nPhoto\n\nBlack Girl Magic, indeed! It\u2019s no surprise that this epic trilogy opener has already been optioned for film. Full of cinematic action sequences (the most memorable of them set almost entirely underwater and employing an army of the dead) and creatures worthy of Star Wars (horse-size \u201clionaires\u201d have saber teeth and horns), it storms the boundaries of the imagination. Yet it also confronts the conscience. Adeyemi\u2019s brutally depicted war between the noble, lighter-skinned kosidans and the enslaved, darker-skinned majis poses thought-provoking questions about race, class and authority that hold up a warning mirror to our sharply divided society.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Tareq is a Syrian refugee whose perilous journey is narrated by the voice of Destiny, characterized as a kindly, prosaic entity. After Tareq\u2019s mother, grandmother and four of his siblings are killed by a bomb, he and his father flee to Turkey with his remaining sister, Susan. They hopscotch from Turkey to Greece, Serbia, Slovenia, Austria and finally to Germany, where he finds a fragile safety. Along the way he witnesses beheadings and drownings, but also experiences the kindness of aid workers like Alexia, an American student. Abawi, a foreign news correspondent, does an admirable job of showing the grim horror of refugee life. But her efforts are occasionally undermined by cartoonish villains (\u201cYou tink you will be saved? Who will save you? Captain America is not real, just movies\u201d) and by some of Destiny\u2019s well-meaning but obvious platitudes: \u201cWhen you truly love someone, their life means more to you than your own.\u201d These interruptions may pull readers out of the story, though perhaps that distance is necessary for adolescents trying to process something as bleak and overwhelming as the Syrian refugee crisis.\n\nPhoto\n\nOf course, once refugees finally arrive in their adopted country, new problems arise. Until she was 13, Sara Saedi, an Iranian-American television writer and the author of the memoir AMERICANIZED: Rebel Without a Green Card (Random House, $17.99, ages 12 and up), was cheerfully oblivious of her family\u2019s immigration status. After her older sister breaks the news that they are \u201cillegal,\u201d Saedi suffers through the usual teenage rites of passage at her Silicon Valley high school (unibrow management, pimple wars, pot smoking) with the added pressure of possible deportation hanging over her head. Saedi adroitly and humorously uses these universal pubescent ordeals to contextualize Iranian culture and the immigrant experience. A memory of being teased about her eyebrow in ninth grade expands into a discussion of beauty norms: When her mother praises her for being hairless, \u201cshe meant by Persian woman standards. I was still hairy by everyone else\u2019s standards.\u201d And she has the sobering realization that pot is a privilege American teenagers can enjoy, but not undocumented kids: \u201cIf I got caught, I\u2019d have a criminal record that could be grounds for deportation.\u201d Very funny but never flippant, Saedi mixes \u201990s pop culture references, adolescent angst and Iranian history into an intimate, informative narrative that thoroughly defies current divisive views on immigration.\n\nPhoto\n\nMary H.K. Choi\u2019s blushingly tender and piquant debut novel, EMERGENCY CONTACT (Simon & Schuster, $17.99; ages 14 and up), about two isolated, misfit college students from Austin who fall in love via text message explores our emotional rather than geographical divides. In \u201cEmergency Contact,\u201d a Korean-American would-be writer named Penny keeps everyone at a distance, the result of living with a single, oversharing mom she calls \u201cthe equivalent of \u2026 human glitter.\u201d But when she rescues Sam, a half-German, half-Polish student filmmaker, from the sidewalk during a panic attack, she becomes his \u201cemergency contact,\u201d and he hers. Their charged, initial banter on text soon develops into increasingly personal exchanges about art, death, unstable moms and pregnant ex-girlfriends. Yet their burgeoning bond keeps stalling out. Burned by past relationships and millennial-ly tethered to their devices, they struggle to connect romantically IRL. Sam \u201ccouldn\u2019t imagine the space Penny would take up in his life if she sprang out of his phone,\u201d and Penny admits \u201cSam was her phone and her phone was Sam.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nChoi, a culture correspondent for HBO\u2019s Vice News, inserts timely issues like sexual assault, cultural appropriation and even DACA into her characters\u2019 intimate conversations, but it is her examination of digital vs. F2F communication that feels the most immediate. Has digital communication become so ubiquitous, and interpersonal contact so arduous, that we\u2019d rather type than talk? Thankfully, no.

She takes comfort from local efforts like a project in Utica, N.Y., where Bosnian Muslim immigrants and local Unitarian Christians watched a Super Bowl together. She applauds aggressive racial integration programs like those run by the American military. She cites her own teaching experience in small seminars at Yale, where students from divergent backgrounds overcame disagreements to achieve mutual respect, sometimes even friendship.\n\nPhoto\n\nYet the scholar in Chua acknowledges that these individual experiences offer less of a social lesson than she would wish.\n\n\u201cStudies show that minimal or superficial exposure to out-group members can actually worsen group division. \u2026 Negative interactions with people from other groups also increase group hostility. So merely putting members of different groups in the same space is not enough and indeed can aggravate political tribalism.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Chua falls back on the very attitude to which she turned her sharply skeptical gaze at the beginning of the book: the conviction that the United States was, is and will remain an exceptional nation, different from all the others. In her introduction, Chua remarked that the United States as a supertribal entity indifferent to ethnicity and culture became at best a partial reality only a generation ago. By book\u2019s end, however, the battered ideal has been polished and refurbished.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Will we, telling ourselves \u2018These immigrants are different,\u2019 be the weak link, the first generation to fail? Will we forget who we are?\u201d That\u2019s inspiring, and even more so are the citations of Martin Luther King Jr., Lin-Manuel Miranda and Langston Hughes that finish the book.\n\nInspiring \u2014 but not wholly reassuring. A lot of the interest of \u201cPolitical Tribes\u201d comes from the strong sense it emanates of an author arguing with herself. Chua both condemns tribalism and respects its power. She insists that the United States alone of nations among the earth has often transcended it \u2014 and then presents impressive contrary evidence from the past and the present. Chua reckons with the many tribalisms of the American past: ethnic, religious and racial. She hopes for a future in which tribalism fades \u2014 even as she mercilessly details its accumulating strength.\n\nAs Chua notes, tribes can coalesce out of previously unrelated pieces. Immigrants to Europe from North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia \u2014 of different languages, ethnicities, folkways and religious practices \u2014 raised children who created for themselves a new identity as post-ethnic Muslims. ISIS, as Chua mordantly observes, is in its own way a melting pot, bringing together young men and women from across Europe, Asia and the Americas to fight for a new ideology. She quotes a New York Times article about young British girls lured to ISIS. For them, \u201cIslam is punk rock.\u201d\n\nTribes can be created by fission as well as by fusion. Chua suggests that in the United States, divisions that would once have been understood as class divides have been reinterpreted in our time as cultural, even when they are not ethnic. \u201cWhite Americans often hold their biggest disdain for other white Americans \u2014 the ones on the opposite side of the cultural divide.\u201d\n\nThese fast-evolving and ever-changing identities may look contingent from the outside. They feel overwhelmingly powerful to those inside. Chua repeatedly scolds American policymakers for underestimating the importance of ethnocultural identity in Vietnam in the 1960s, Venezuela in the 1990s and Afghanistan in the 2000s. Through her book pulses an evident worry that tribal claims are now overpowering national ones within the United States.

Fred Harris is the second person to the right of Kerner. Underwood Archives/Getty Images\n\n\u201cOur nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white \u2013 separate and unequal.\u201d\n\nFifty years ago, on March 1, 1968, these were the grim words of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, called the Kerner Commission after its chairman, Gov. Otto Kerner of Illinois.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson had established the commission to examine the disorders and violent protests in Detroit, Newark and well over 100 other American cities during the summer of 1967, and earlier. What it found was searing. \u201cWhat white Americans have never fully understood \u2013 but what the Negro can never forget \u2013 is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto,\u201d the commission concluded. \u201cWhite institutions created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it.\u201d\n\nMostly moderate and mostly white men, the members of the bipartisan panel carried the imprimatur of the political establishment. Their recommendations attracted widespread public debate. The paperback edition of the report sold over two million copies.\n\nOccupied by the Vietnam War and concerned about the legacy of his Great Society domestic agenda, Johnson distanced himself from the \u201ctwo societies\u201d warning. But the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Robert Kennedy strongly endorsed the commission\u2019s findings and recommendations before they were assassinated and before more protests erupted during that traumatic year of 1968.\n\nThe Kerner Commission recommended \u201cmassive and sustained\u201d investments in jobs and education to reduce poverty, inequality and racial injustice. Have we made progress in the last 50 years?\n\nA Return to Segregation\n\nIn many ways, things have gotten no better \u2014 or have gotten worse \u2014 since 1968.

The overall poverty rate remains about the same today as it was 50 years ago; the total number of poor people has increased from over 25 million to well over 40 million, more than the population of California.\n\nMeanwhile, the rich have profited at the expense of most working Americans. Today, the top 1 percent receive 52 percent of all new income. Rich people are healthier and live longer. They get a better education, which produces greater gains in income. And their greater economic power translates into greater political power.\n\nFive Indicators America of the 1960s contrasted with the most recent available data.

I\u2019d love to jump right in and hear your aspirations for Prairie View. What do you hope to accomplish in your time as president? I assume you had many offers to lead other colleges. Why was Prairie View different?\n\nRuth Simmons: Well, I\u2019m a native of Texas, and one of the things that I did when I returned to Houston after I retired from Brown was think about the ways I could use my experience to help the community. I started with small ventures in the city, but I hadn\u2019t thought really that another university would be in my life. But when I was approached by Prairie View, I thought immediately about its significant impact on my brother, who went there. And what Dillard did for me.\n\nI grew up in a segregated neighborhood in Grapeland, Tex., with very little experience with the world. The transition that Dillard enabled for me was extremely valuable. As an undergraduate, I began to grow a sense of confidence that helped me move from a fairly insular environment to a bigger stage when I went to graduate school.\n\nMy aspirations for Prairie View are to essentially make sure the university is continuing to do the same thing for students today that it did for my brother \u2014 and Dillard did for me. And that is to offer the advantage of a strong education that will prepare students for the careers they want, in a social and cultural context that helps them develop the confidence to perform after graduation.\n\nAs president, that means focusing on time-honored strategies to success that apply to universities everywhere: worrying about the faculty who are recruited here, the campus experience, and whether we are providing the leadership and internship opportunities that students need. It means worrying about the reputation of the university. It\u2019s obviously a much more competitive world today than it was when I was a student, but the underlying work to move the university to a level of achievement that makes students and alumni proud is the same.\n\nM.J.: What do you see as some of the major challenges facing historically black colleges and universities?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: The general challenge for H.B.C.U.s is not unlike the problem many universities face today, and that is the financial model. Being tuition dependent has become a large problem for all universities. H.B.C.U.s are dependent on raising money, but that is a reality that most universities obviously face. So it very much depends on the question of whether the schools have a good-enough foundation because of secure financing. When it comes to the federal government\u2019s role in supporting H.B.C.U.s, I think we don\u2019t yet understand the extent to which they will be affected by the changes in Washington today. To say that many are not hopeful in this moment is an understatement. We just don\u2019t know.\n\nFrankly, that\u2019s why I advocate for developing enough financial independence to secure the future of our institutions. That means looking for different revenue streams, looking to increase our ability to raise funds and finding alternate programs that help to bring more income into our university. The only strategy cannot be to persistently raise tuition, making college outside the reach of many families.\n\nM.J.: You\u2019ve led several institutions that are all very different from each other, and the topic of leadership is something you\u2019ve talked a lot about. In another interview with The Times you said that it\u2019s much easier to lead people \u201cif you convey the underlying principles.\u201d Can you elaborate?\n\nR.S.: One thing that I\u2019ve learned is that the perceptions of what it takes to be a leader are often based on prototypical models that don\u2019t have much truth in reality. People look at the institutions that I have led and they see dissimilarities. I see similarities. When people think in terms of leadership, they\u2019re often thinking about the kind of specific skills needed for different types of enterprises. I think of leadership as more of a disposition \u2014 the ability to step into a situation to learn about the history of the enterprise, the opportunities that it faces, the culture that exists and the people who are served by it. To look at all of that, to listen to stakeholders and then to think about how that enterprise or institution should best be served. There is no one model of leadership if you approach it that way. What I have tried to do wherever I go is to start where the institution is rather than try to import particularly rigid constructs from other places. In that sense, I think a leader is more than anything else a facilitator. A person who is able to come in to show a community a picture of what it is, to provide some insight into what it could be \u2014 how it could be different or improved perhaps \u2014 and then enlist the help of people who are there and others who support that institution in order to move forward together.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nI don\u2019t subscribe to the model of hero leadership, which is identifying somebody who can come in and have magical powers and then wield the wand and fix things that have not been fixable before. I don\u2019t see that. I think leadership is a community affair.\n\nM.J.: That makes sense. So how do you approach educating the current generation of students at Prairie View to lead in the way you described?\n\nR.S.: People today are fond of leadership programs that theorize about the profile and tenets of leadership. And students anxiously get involved in those programs. I rather think that our entire campuses are incubators of leadership even without the formality of such programs because if we\u2019re doing what we should be doing, we are acclimating students to an environment in which they have to learn to work with others who are very different from themselves. And that seems to me to be the first requirement of leadership. To actually learn to work with people in a respectful and inclusive way is inordinately important. A campus provides one of the best opportunities for people to be able to do that because you sit in class alongside people whom you initially don\u2019t know. You are discussing your ideas, having people respond to them and often rejecting what you\u2019re saying. You are joining organizations that have certain aims that are being advanced by the collective, so you\u2019re learning how to facilitate. You are asked to step into leadership roles either through student government or organizations. Even in the classroom context you might play a leadership role. You have to learn to express yourself, to be convincing, to write out your ideas, to be more thoughtful than you\u2019d ordinarily be. All of those things are components of leadership.\n\nM.J.: Some would argue that social media, or perhaps disagreements over the concept of safe spaces, have made it more challenging for people to come together and to work together.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: Yeah, I would say that people frequently say that, but that has certainly not been my experience. I would say that in my days as a student, the tensions were higher, the disagreements were greater, the separation among us was certainly more pronounced. And people are kind of inventing a new narrative, that things are so much worse today than they were in the past. I don\u2019t buy that. I think we have new terminology, because the modern sciences of psychology and sociology and so forth and modern media have enabled us to peer into areas that we were not able to see as easily as before. And so when you have social media and all of the ways in which people can now say whatever they want to say \u2014 in an unartful or offensive way \u2014 that turns the volume up to be sure. But it doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t there before.\n\nI would say that the current situation ought to give us much more practice in how to engage with each other because it is not underground. It\u2019s out front, it\u2019s in the open. The media today and the things that are being reported should be upsetting or troubling to students, my goodness. But it may be an even better opportunity to engage students.\n\nAs a teacher, as an educator, I would say these times are especially fertile for teaching the skills that are needed in a world in which there are many types of people, many perspectives and so forth. Students don\u2019t need to feel silenced by the current situation. When students at Brown came to me and said, you know, they were hurt because somebody asked them about their hair, and they were tired of that and they didn\u2019t want any part of it, I would say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s just too bad!\u201d Somebody asked you about your hair, tell them about your hair. You are in college not to hide from that. You\u2019re there to teach the world about yourself, you\u2019re there to learn about others and to teach them about who you are. So I\u2019d rather think this whole notion of protecting people from that is something that we have to take in hand and deal with. And help students see the opportunity in that because if they engage with people who have those kinds of perspectives, they are going to be much stronger in the end than if they run away.\n\nM.J.: Do you see the situation differently for students at H.B.C.U.s? You mentioned that Dillard gave you the space to learn and build confidence before heading to graduate school.\n\nR.S.: There is a narrative that many people have for H.B.C.U.s. People see them as a monolith, or only see them as filling a gap that exists for African-Americans. H.B.C.U.s are not a brand. They are institutions with a certain history \u2014 they were originally set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for education \u2014 but they are not all alike, and are very diverse in what they offer.\n\nPrairie View, for example, is the second-oldest public institution of higher education in the state of Texas. It was set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for ex-slaves and whites. For a long time it provided educational opportunities for black students that wouldn\u2019t have been open to them otherwise. In nursing, architecture, engineering and other STEM fields at a time when many blacks were not able to go into those areas, the university was able to facilitate the entry of blacks into those professions.\n\nM.J.: Yes, this is something that Nikole Hannah-Jones has written about for The New York Times Magazine, in particular how Xavier University of Louisiana sends more black students to medical school than almost any other college in the country. I read that Prairie View has many more students who graduate with degrees in architecture and engineering.\n\nR.S.: Yes, going to Dillard is not like going to Prairie View. So the student who chooses to go to one H.B.C.U. may not find another appealing. That has to do with the unique features of the place, the academic culture and so on, the traditions. All of that makes a big difference.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen I went off to college, I was just trying to find a place where I could be a student without impediments that in that day and time were fairly widely known to be substantial if you enrolled in a majority-white institution. There was no question that in 1963, if you went off to college in the South, you had to be very careful about where you studied. The racial dynamic was very challenging at that time. One of the things I\u2019m learning now is that many of the students I speak to at Prairie View today have the same kinds of thoughts that I had those many years ago. They ask themselves, where can I feel comfortable so that I don\u2019t have to worry about anything but my academic work? So certainly that plays a factor in why students apply to H.B.C.U.s. And for some H.B.C.U.s, applications are way up. But if you reach the point where you think that a category of institutions are the right choice for you \u2014 going to an H.B.C.U. just to go to an H.B.C.U. \u2014 then you\u2019re not thinking broadly enough.\n\nM.J.: As you look across the landscape of higher education, what other challenges do college students face today?\n\nR.S.: I guess I worry a lot about our students having the skills and the experience to promote respectful interactions with a wide-ranging group of people. Students can be quite passionate about what they see on the national scene and how sometimes dangerous they think it is \u2014 how unpleasant it is and so forth. But we\u2019ve got to try to find a way on our campuses not to taint the national picture as hopeless, or as being antithetical to anything that we can think of as good and admirable. The last thing we want is for our students to bow out and decide that it isn\u2019t worth trying to do anything about a hopeless situation.\n\nAnd I do think that civility goes hand in hand with being hopeful. Hopeful that the next person you meet you will be able to converse with you in a respectful way. Hopeful that the next election cycle is going to give you a chance to be engaged and able to do something that makes you feel a sense of your own agency. Hopeful that the things will get better rather than worse.\n\nSo much of what we have to do on our campuses is really to hold open the possibility for people that civil society will in the end right itself \u2014 if enough of us are engaged. I am so thankful every day for the fact that I grew up in a time when nobody thought blacks would be able to be integrated into American society, they would never be able to hold important positions, they\u2019d never be respected intellectually, they\u2019d never be able to do the things that they are now able to do. So why did we persist? And why did we continue to work toward betterment? We did it because we had people working with us in education who were ever hopeful that things were going to change. So I like to say to educators, you have to be always projecting to students that civility enables hopefulness to be ever resurgent.", "keywords": ["leadership", "generation", "think", "cultivating", "view", "students", "things", "say", "dont", "ruth", "simmons", "able", "today", "college", "prairie"], "polarity": 0.18839701321015756, "subjectivity": 0.47766767453623127},

Those killings were followed by the murders in, January 1972, of another pair of on-duty officers, Gregory Foster and Rocco Laurie, who were gunned down from behind as they patrolled the Lower East Side.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe city was on edge, rife with racial tension and awash in conspiracies.

Mr. Bottom, also known as Jalil Abdul Muntaqim, is still in prison at the Sullivan Correctional Facility in Fallsburg, N.Y., officials said.\n\nIn a statement condemning the decision, Commissioner James P.

In the end, a majority of panelists found that the state had prepared Mr. Bell well for release.

His relative cannot care for him, so he is left alone for much of the time.

The last time he was released, a nurse practitioner came the following afternoon to check on him. When she buzzed the doorbell, there was no answer, so she tried us. We let her in, only to discover that our tenant had pulled out his catheter and was incoherent. The nurse practitioner called 911, and the police arrived and did an assessment; they recommended that our tenant be moved to a place where his needs could be met. But they said moving him against his will would require a social worker\u2019s recommendation, plus other legal actions.\n\nWe could not reach his relative by phone, despite multiple attempts.

My inclination is to follow up on the report recommending that he be moved to a suitable facility, rather than wait to see if action is taken.

And as the police officers told you, that\u2019s a judgment that needs to be made by a trained person. Still, the events you describe strongly suggest that your tenant has reached this point, and that it\u2019s more important to take care of him than to respect his demands to be left alone.\n\nYou have two rather different sets of concerns here. One is for your building and your family: Your tenant\u2019s condition poses a risk of serious harm to both. The other is for your tenant: You have good evidence that he shouldn\u2019t be left alone, for the sake of his health and his well-being. If his interests and yours pulled in opposite directions, you might face a hard choice. But they don\u2019t. The first set of concerns gives you moral standing to intervene. Unless his relative accepts responsibility for him, the fact that she disagrees is, morally speaking, neither here nor there. Given that you do have standing, you should then aim to do what is best for him and, as it happens, for you. It would be both prudent and caring to explore getting him into a place where he can be properly looked after.\n\nA college friend invited me to stay with him when I returned to my hometown after a long absence. He lives alone in a househe inherited. The bed linens were clean, and the bathroom was clean, but there were dust, cobwebs and clutter all over the house, and the whole place needed a good cleaning, painting and replacement of flooring. He said he was trying to downsize, but the living room was filled with sheets, books, pans. I really had no recourse but to stay there, as he was my transport to the airport several hours away, and I did. In retrospect, I worry about him and his mental state. What can I do?\n\nName Withheld\n\nHow long has he been in the house? If he\u2019s in the process of discarding the detritus of his parents\u2019 lives, it may just be that this is going slowly, especially if he\u2019s an only child. He invited you in, you say, and your bedroom and bathroom were fine. Still, I\u2019ll grant that what you describe would seem consistent with conditions like depression or even compulsive hoarding. Aside from his cluttered and untidy home, did he seem to be socially isolated or impeded in major life activities?\n\nAssuming that he does have a serious problem, it doesn\u2019t sound as if you have a close-enough relationship with this man to intervene effectively from a distance. Do you know of friends or relatives who are in a position to do more? If you think you\u2019re the only person who has noticed and is in a position to do anything, you might help your friend simply by letting him know that the condition of his house has made you wonder whether he has a problem. He might resent the observation, but the chance that you could spur him to seek the help he needs would be worth risking your not-very-close relationship.", "keywords": ["neighbors", "renters", "youre", "left", "stay", "warn", "tenant", "nurse", "needs", "house", "york", "place", "relative", "racist"], "polarity": 0.09738230519480523, "subjectivity": 0.36862554112554113},

After all, by any normative understanding, \u201cracist,\u201d \u201cxenophobe\u201d and \u201cnativist\u201d are negative words from both a moral and rational point of view. Their definitions, taken from any standard dictionary, will bear this out. Racism, xenophobia and nativism embody, in their very meanings, both irrationality and unfairness. Irrationality is considered to be a negative quality (except perhaps by Dadaists); so is unfairness.\n\nFor those of us to wish to understand the way Bannon is manipulating language here, and to what end, it is important to note what he is not doing. It is typical for far-right politicians who want to attract racist, xenophobic or nativist voters to attempt to provide at least the pretense of reasons, invariably shoddy ones, for animus against racial minorities, immigrants, or foreigners.\n\nIn the United States, President Trump regularly connects individual crimes or criminal gangs with immigration in an effort to more broadly establish a link between immigrants with crime in the public consciousness. Though studies have shown that immigrants, both legal and illegal, are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans, Trump continues to make such claims (his statement that immigrants bring \u201ctremendous amounts of crime\u201d received a score of \u201cfour Pinocchios\u201d from fact-checkers).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSimilarly bizarre false claims are made by non-American far-right politicians, who also regularly engage in anti-Semitic innuendo. There is a natural next step to using innuendo and the manufacturing of reasons to justify racism and xenophobia \u2014 namely to drop the facade altogether. Bannon is urging the adoption of an irrational bias against racial minorities, immigrants and foreigners, one that does not require reasons, even bad ones, to support it.

It was overwhelmingly seen as a disaster for DeVos, who struggled to answer very basic questions. She couldn\u2019t say, for example, why schools in Michigan, her home state, have largely gotten worse since the widespread introduction of the school choice policies she lobbied for. When Stahl asked whether, as secretary, she\u2019d ever visited a failing school to find out what went wrong, DeVos said, \u201cI have not intentionally visited schools that are underperforming.\u201d\n\nLike many things in Trump\u2019s administration, this performance was shocking but not surprising. Before becoming secretary of education, DeVos had never worked as an educator or a policymaker; she was a donor to education reform efforts favored by the right, such as school choice and vouchers. Her confirmation hearings last year were an embarrassment. She appeared to be unfamiliar with the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, a federal civil rights law. After taking office, she described historically black universities and colleges, founded in response to segregation, as \u201cpioneers when it comes to school choice.\u201d\n\nAs this comment suggested, DeVos is, at best, oblivious about race. That obliviousness \u2014 or worse \u2014 is behind one of the more disturbing moments in her \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview. In a sick irony, some on the right would use the recent school shooting in Parkland, Fla. \u2014 allegedly committed by a young man who carved swastikas into the magazines for his semiautomatic rifle \u2014 as a pretext to roll back civil rights protections for students of color. On \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d DeVos, whom Trump has chosen to lead his new school safety commission, appeared to signal she\u2019s on board.\n\nTo understand how, we need to start with a letter that Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, sent to DeVos and Attorney General Jeff Sessions on March 5 about the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRubio referred to a 2014 Barack Obama-era directive, known as the Dear Colleague Letter on the Nondiscriminatory Administration of School Discipline, intended to address the so-called school-to-prison pipeline, in which disadvantaged students are funneled into the criminal justice system for misbehaving at school. The Dear Colleague Letter said school personnel must \u201cunderstand that they, rather than school resource officers and other security or law enforcement personnel, are responsible for administering routine student discipline.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

But she is not American and I\u2019m not at all a Bond woman. I grew up watching movies and I love the old Hollywood movies especially, but it makes me sad to realize that Hollywood\u2019s portrayal of Asians has been mocking or missing for most of its history.

He argued that biological differences and not a lack of opportunity explained the shortage of women in leadership and technical positions.\n\nGoogle fired Mr. Damore. He filed a lawsuit in January with another former employee, claiming that the company discriminates against white men with conservative views. In a separate lawsuit, a former recruiter for YouTube sued Google because, he said, he was fired for resisting a mandate to hire only diverse \u2014 female or black and Latino \u2014 candidates.\n\nGoogle\u2019s handling of the issue was also upsetting to Mr. Damore\u2019s critics. In another lawsuit filed last month, a former Google employee said he was fired because he was too outspoken in advocating diversity and for spending too much time on \u201csocial activism.\u201d\n\nInside Google, vocal diversity proponents say they are the targets of a small group of employees who are sympathetic to Mr. Damore. In some cases, screenshots of comments made on an internal social network were leaked to online forums frequented by right-wing groups, which searched for and published personal information like home addresses and phone numbers of the Google employees, they said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2015, Google started an internal program called Respect@, which includes a way for employees to anonymously report complaints of inappropriate behavior by co-workers. Some diversity supporters say other employees are taking advantage of this program to accuse them of harassment for out-of-context statements.\n\n\u201cSome people feel threatened by movements that promote diversity and inclusion. They think it means people are going to come for their jobs,\u201d said Liz Fong-Jones, a Google engineer who is a vocal supporter of diversity.\n\nMany big tech companies are struggling with the challenge of creating a more diverse work force. In 2015, Facebook adopted the so-called Rooney Rule. Originally used by the National Football League to prod teams to consider coaching prospects who are black, the rule requires managers to interview candidates from underrepresented backgrounds for open positions. But last year, Facebook\u2019s female engineers said that gender bias was still a problem and that their work received more scrutiny than men\u2019s work.\n\nEven executives tasked with promoting diversity have had difficulties. In October, Denise Young Smith, who was Apple\u2019s vice president of inclusion and diversity, came under fire when she said that there was diversity even among 12 white, blue-eyed, blond men because they had different backgrounds and experiences. She later apologized, saying she did not intend to play down the importance of a non-homogenous work force. She left Apple in December.\n\nThe tension is elevated at Google, at least in part, by its workplace culture. Google has encouraged employees to express themselves and challenge one another. It provides many communication systems for people to discuss work and nonwork related issues. Even topics considered out of bounds at other workplaces \u2014 like sharp criticism of its own products \u2014 are discussed openly and celebrated.\n\nIn January, on one of Google\u2019s 90,000 \u201cgroups\u201d \u2014 internal email lists around a discussion topic \u2014 an employee urged colleagues to donate money to help pay Mr. Damore\u2019s legal fees from his lawsuit against Google to promote \u201cviewpoint diversity,\u201d according to a person who saw the posting but is not permitted to share the information publicly.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He said he had meant that being a Republican did not exempt Google employees from following the company\u2019s code of conduct.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA Google spokeswoman said in a statement that the company encouraged lively debate. But there are limits.\n\n\u201cCreating a more diverse workplace is a big challenge and a priority we\u2019ve been working to address. Some people won\u2019t agree with our approach, and they\u2019re free to express their disagreement,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Gina Scigliano. \u201cBut some conduct and discussion in the workplace crosses a line, and we don\u2019t tolerate it. We enforce strong policies, and work with affected employees, to ensure everyone can do their work free of harassment, discrimination and bullying.\u201d\n\nIn the past, discussions about diversity in Google\u2019s online chat groups would encounter skeptical but subtle comments or questions. The debate turned openly antagonistic after Mr. Damore\u2019s memo, which was titled \u201cGoogle\u2019s Ideological Echo Chamber.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe James Damore thing brought everything to a head,\u201d said Vicki Holland, a linguist who has worked at Google for seven years. \u201cIt brought everything to the surface where everyone could see it.\u201d\n\nMr. Damore said he began to question Google\u2019s diversity policies at a weekly company meeting last March. At the meeting, Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s vice president of people operations, \u201cpointed out and shamed\u201d departments in which women accounted for less than half the staff, according to Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe two female executives \u2014 who are among the company\u2019s highest-ranking women \u2014 said Google\u2019s \u201cracial and gender preferences were not up for debate,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Mr. Damore subsequently attended a \u201cDiversity and Inclusion Summit,\u201d where it reinforced his view that Google was \u201celevating political correctness over merit\u201d with its diversity measures.\n\nMr. Damore said he had written his memo afterward in response.\n\nMs. Scigliano, the Google spokeswoman, said the company looked forward to fighting Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit in court. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said in an August blog post that he had fired Mr. Damore because his memo advanced \u201charmful gender stereotypes\u201d but that \u201cmuch of the memo is fair to debate.\u201d\n\nSome employees said they were abstaining from internal debate on sensitive issues because they worried that their comments might be misconstrued or used against them. Like the broader internet, the conversations tend to be dominated by the loudest voices, they said.\n\nGoogle\u2019s diversity advocates said they would like to see more moderation on internal forums with officials stepping in to defuse tensions before conversations get out of hand. Ms. Miller, the Coworker.org co-director, said Google employees had expressed concern about how this would affect an internal culture rooted in transparency and free expression.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s on everyone\u2019s mind is: Has the culture been inextricably damaged by this environment?\u201d she said.", "keywords": ["google", "hard", "damore", "internal", "lawsuit", "employees", "work", "trying", "diversity", "googles", "diversify", "fired", "mr"], "polarity": 0.08552789802789805, "subjectivity": 0.3460065686628187},

Asked if her resignation had to do with the direction Ms. Freiman was taking the institute, or rather her management style, William A. Royall Jr., co-chairman of the I.C.A. board, said: \u201cThere were no reservations about the curatorial direction she was taking whatsoever,\u201d without addressing the rest.\n\nThe show will go on as planned, led by the I.C.A.\u2019s chief curator, Stephanie Smith. \u201cThe exhibition is functioning as a declaration of intent for the I.C.A. being an institution that\u2019s going to grapple directly with issues that matter in our world through supporting artists\u2019 diverse voices,\u201d Ms. Smith said.\n\nAlmost half the artists have been commissioned to make new work for the show.

Over the course of six months, the artist collected snippets of conversation from patrons on issues of the day.\n\nMr. Kennedy then distilled the text into hundreds of brightly colored letterpress prints that will wallpaper the entrance wall to the I.C.A. \u201cRichmond citizens will walk in and see their own voices reflected on the wall of the institution,\u201d Ms. Smith said.\n\nMr. Rucker, who is in residence at V.C.U., working with students, is interspersing historical artifacts related to the Ku Klux Klan with his refashioned Klansmen robes.

The Baptist part is inherited, like baldness or dimples: Both of my grandfathers and three of my uncles were Baptist preachers, and my parents met as graduate students at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Genes aside, the church \u2014 plastic chairs, pilling carpet and grape juice for communion \u2014 was the organizing institution of my childhood, where I met my closest friends and most of the significant adults in my life.\n\nChurch attendance has been in generational decline. I began calling around, exploring whether people in small towns were looking for community elsewhere and, with the white nationalist rallies so often in the news, whether young white people were looking for meaning in the grim sanctuaries of the alt-right.\n\nBut I kept hearing about something different. Pastors, theologians and sociologists were talking of how black worshipers were leaving white-majority churches. They were leaving quietly and not en masse, a family here, a single person there. But it was happening everywhere, a movement large enough for some to see the unraveling of decades of efforts at racial reconciliation.\n\nI would find someone on Facebook, a black worshiper who had posted about leaving her mostly white church, and then I would find someone in the same situation halfway across the country. They would both think they were going through this alone, yet the accounts would be remarkably similar, the timelines nearly identical, even some of the words and phrases the same. There had been, I discovered, some sharp reporting about this, particularly from the writer Deborah Jian Lee, but not as much as you would expect for an experience that seemed to be this broadly shared.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPeople spoke to me of being tired, let down, heartbroken. Political and cultural partitions that they had long overlooked at worship time now overshadowed every service. The realizations almost always began with the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012, and a sense that white church leaders or fellow worshipers did not want to talk about how a black teenager walking home from a 7-Eleven could end up dead. Sometimes the preacher would privately express sympathy, but also concern about how his white congregation would take it.

As Nils Gilman argues in The American Interest, that ideal reached its apogee with the election of Barack Obama.\n\nBut Obama\u2019s election also revealed the limits of that ideal.

Progress is less about understanding and liking each other and more about smashing structures that others defend.\n\nThe second thing that happened was that reason, apparently, ceased to matter. Today\u2019s young people were raised within an educational ideology that taught them that individual reason and emotion were less important than perspectivism \u2014 what perspective you bring as a white man, a black woman, a transgender Mexican, or whatever.\n\nThese students were raised with the idea that individual reason is downstream from group identity. Then along came the 2016 election to validate that point of view!

The powerful few keep everyone else down. The solutions to injustice and suffering are simple and obvious: Defeat the powerful. Passion is more important than reason because the oppressed masses have to mobilize to storm the barricades. Debate is counterproductive because it dilutes passion and sows confusion. Discordant ideas are not there to inform; they are there to provide cover for oppression.\n\nSome people I admire see today\u2019s student mobbism as an outbreak of an ersatz religion, but I\u2019d say their theory of social change is at least comprehensible given the era they inhabit.\n\nIf I could talk to the students I\u2019d try to persuade them that mistake theory is a more accurate and effective way to change the world than conflict theory, but I probably wouldn\u2019t persuade them.\n\nSo I\u2019d just ask them to take two courses.

Their hope was that by sharing their stories they could start dialogues and inspire change.\n\nI could identify; I knew what it was like to sometimes feel like an outsider. And as an editor at The Times, I wondered what I could do to advance the conversation.\n\nAn answer came as I was researching an obit for a woman in the tennis world. I discovered the story of Mary Ewing Outerbridge when I stumbled upon a website crediting her with introducing tennis to America. I wondered if she had received a Times obituary when she died in 1886. I checked our digital newspaper archives. She had not.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter that, anytime I came across an interesting person who died years ago, I searched our archives for an obit. Those who didn\u2019t get one were, not surprisingly, largely women and people of color. I started talking about my research with colleagues, friends and relatives, all of whom began sending me more names.\n\nI soon had a list of dozens of fascinating people, such as Ms. Larsen; Madhubala, a Bollywood actress whose poetically tragic life was cut short; and Margaret Abbott, a golfer who died without ever knowing that she was the first American woman to win an Olympic championship.\n\nEven more surprising were some blatant omissions of those who had achieved a measure of fame in their lifetime, like the poet Sylvia Plath, the writer Charlotte Bront\u00eb and the photographer Diane Arbus.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t they get obits? I can only speculate. Perhaps the mark they made on the world wasn\u2019t recognized until decades after their deaths. Or maybe some of them faded into obscurity, their achievements forgotten. It could be that The Times didn\u2019t learn about their deaths until it was too late. Or that the omission was more purposeful, a judgment call of an editor who didn\u2019t deem the death newsworthy.\n\nRegardless, I now had an opportunity to give these women their due.\n\nIn November 2017, I met Jessica Bennett, The Times\u2019s first gender editor. She agreed that Overlooked was a compelling way to add to the record, and we decided to partner up.\n\nWhat followed was a whirlwind of excitement in the newsroom, with writers, editors, international correspondents, page designers, photo editors \u2014 whether they were women, men, people of color or not \u2014 asking us how they could contribute.

We also do our own homework: We investigate, research and ask around before settling on our subjects.\n\nSome might think our process presumptuous. Who, after all, anointed a handful of Times editors to stand by the roadside as a parade of humanity passes and single out this one, this one \u2014 but not that one \u2014 as worthy of being remembered?\n\nThe answer is that no one did, actually, because that is not precisely what we decide. We make no judgments, moral or otherwise, about human worth. What we do try to judge, however, is newsworthiness, and that\u2019s a whole other standard.\n\nPhoto\n\nThere is no formula, scoring system or checklist. But we do hold to certain criteria, slippery as they may be. Fame, of the widespread kind, will usually get someone past the velvet ropes. Accomplishment, with wide impact, matters as much, and it often goes hand in hand with fame.\n\nBut achievement may also speak softly. Eugene Goldwasser, to name one subject among 1,195 Times obits in 2010, was a largely unsung biochemist whose 20-year pursuit of an elusive protein led to the development of a widely used anemia drug that became one of the biggest products of the biotechnology industry.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWangari Maathai was a Kenyan environmentalist who began a movement to reforest her country by paying poor women a few shillings to plant trees. She might have died in 2011 largely unknown to the wider world had she not become the first African woman to win a Nobel Peace Prize seven years before.\n\nSometimes we choose a subject in part to represent a group whose contributions were forgotten or ignored. Violet Cowden, who also died in 2011, comes to mind: She helped ferry supplies for American troops in World War II as a member of the stateside Women Airforce Service Pilots.\n\nFor every person we decide to write about there are innumerable others we decide against. Fame and accomplishment are relative; the public eye is easily distracted, and only a moment or two in its fickle gaze may not be enough to merit a backward look in The Times.\n\nThe same might be said of a sparkling r\u00e9sum\u00e9. The best schools, a successful corporate climb, charitable good works and distinguished service awards are impressive and laudable, but not necessarily newsworthy to a global audience.\n\nOne thing to remember is that it is not our intent to honor the dead; we leave the tributes to the eulogists. We seek only to report deaths and to sum up lives, illuminating why, in our judgment, those lives were significant. The justification for the obituary is in the story it tells.\n\nMany readers legitimately ask: Why are the vast majority of our obituary subjects white men? The answer lies in our not-so-distant history.\n\nUnlike the rest of the newsroom, the obituaries desk covers the past, not the present. Our pages mirror the world of 1975 or 1965 or 1955, or even earlier: They\u2019re a rearview mirror, reflecting the world as it was, not as it is, and not as we might wish it to have been.\n\nAnd so we are, inevitably, a generation or three behind in tracking the evolution of gender and racial dynamics, among other things. The prominent shapers of society back then, those who held (and didn\u2019t easily give up) the levers of power, were disproportionately white and male, be they former United States senators or business titans or Hollywood directors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith Overlooked, our new collection of obituaries for women and others who never got them, The Times is acknowledging that many worthy subjects were skipped for generations, for whatever reasons.\n\nConscious or unconscious bias? Could be. Perhaps my predecessors and I were never informed of the deaths. Maybe those who knew the deceased did not think we\u2019d be interested. Maybe an editor passed for lack of interest, or maybe considered an obit but did not have a reporter available to write it. (A practical reality that bedevils us today.)\n\nPerhaps the significance of an individual portrayed in Overlooked was not fully recognized until decades after her death. Or perhaps the paper\u2019s selection standards in eras past unfairly valued the achievements of the white, male mainstream over those of minorities and women who may have been more on the margins.\n\nI\u2019d like to think that those portrayed in Overlooked would be prime candidates for an obit in The Times today \u2014 precisely because they fit a broader standard of significance and impact and, by the way, offer compelling stories.\n\nSo why not more women and people of color on the obituary pages? (Why, for that matter, not more openly gay people, or transgender people?)\n\nThe larger answer: Because relatively few of them were allowed to make such a mark on society in their own time. Universities may have barred them. Businesses and political parties may have shut them out. The tables of power were crowded with white men; there were few seats for anyone else.\n\nThere were, of course, women who crashed glass ceilings, blacks and Native Americans and people of Asian heritage who pushed through \u201cwhites only\u201d barriers. And their stories have been told in the obituary pages over many decades.\n\nNo doubt, we\u2019ll see more of them in the years to come. As time goes on, I imagine that their stories will be increasingly framed not by broken barriers but simply by what they built, unencumbered by the dead weights of discrimination.", "keywords": ["overlooked", "think", "maybe", "pages", "past", "obituaries", "women", "desk", "times", "men", "white", "world", "death", "obituary"], "polarity": 0.10482996385058244, "subjectivity": 0.431367429821038},

Sarah Laskow of The Atlantic explained in 2014 that philosophers at this time were, in the words of the sociologist Karl Mannheim, \u201canxious to find a general law to express the rhythm of historical development, based on the biological law of the limited lifetimes of man.\u201d /But understanding societal phenomena through the lens of groups of people born around the same time has always had its limits.\n\nFor example, it\u2019s true that for young men coming-of-age during the Vietnam War, being born in a particular year (and, thanks to the draft lottery, on a particular day) could be life-shaping. But even here, an individual\u2019s class was a factor in whether he actually went to war \u2014 men from privileged backgrounds had many options to avoid the draft, the burden of which fell mainly on the working class.\n\nLike war service, entering the labor market at a time of recession, as most millennials did, can be difficult. But race and class are more important in affecting how this experience plays out for individuals.\n\nTake white millennial college graduates: Yes, they\u2019re part of an age cohort that has experienced worse economic conditions than graduates of the preceding generation \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t give us a particularly meaningful understanding of their plight, given that they are still better off when it comes to income than the average non-college-educated worker of any age.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome may argue that the generation game, if intellectually vacuous, is basically harmless. But dividing society by generation obscures the real and enduring lines of race, class and gender. When, for example, baby boomers are blamed for \u201cruining America,\u201d the argument lumps together Donald Trump and a 60-year-old black woman who works for minimum wage cleaning one of his hotels.\n\nThe pattern of inherited privilege points to yet another reality that the generation game ignores: the decline of social mobility between generations and the rise of what the French economist Thomas Piketty has called a \u201cpatrimonial society.\u201d When it comes to wealth and its accompanying privileges, the wealth of the previous generation of one\u2019s own family matter more than whether your birth year falls on one or other side of some arbitrary boundary.\n\nToday\u2019s young people may choose political action aimed at reversing these trends or to let them continue and accelerate.

Many Germans and Swedes now recognize \u2014 and some celebrate \u2014 the fact that their fellow citizens can have any skin color or religion. But the attempt to turn countries with monoethnic identities into truly multiethnic nations is a historically unique experiment, and so it should hardly come as a surprise that it has encountered some fierce resistance.\n\nThe situation in Canada and the United States, despite their histories as countries of immigration, has important similarities to that in Europe. Both have historically had rigid racial hierarchies. And in recent decades, both have made real steps toward overcoming these injustices: African-Americans, for example, are better represented in business and government than at any previous point in American history. This has made opposition to a more equal, multiethnic society more fervid among those who feel their privileges threatened. There is a sizable number of Americans for whom the idea of the nation remains synonymous with whiteness and Christianity.\n\nSo long as nationalism is associated with one particular ethnic or religious group, it will serve to exclude and disadvantage others. The only way to keep the destructive potential of nationalism in check is to fight for a society in which collective identity transcends ethnic and religious boundaries \u2014 one in which citizens from all religious or ethnic backgrounds are treated with the same respect as citizens from the majority group.\n\nTo effect this transformation is one of the great political challenges of our age. It requires principled resistance to right-wing nationalism, but it can succeed only if those who are most open to diversity abandon their hostility to other forms of nationalism.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nOne common reaction to the dangerous excesses of nationalism has been to forgo the need for any form of collective identity, exhorting people to transcend tribal allegiances completely. But for better or probably worse, it\u2019s easier to be moved by the suffering of people with whom we have some form of kinship. That is why nationalism remains one of the most powerful vehicles for expanding our circle of sympathy.\n\nAnother common reaction to the resurgence of nationalism has been to celebrate more narrow forms of collective identity, such as race or religion. At a time when many minority groups are under attack, it is, of course, crucial to defend them against discrimination. But it is also important to remember that such groups, too, are capable of oppressing their own members, for example by enforcing restrictive moral codes. That\u2019s why the only way to allow individuals true freedom to lead their lives is to preserve some form of political identity independent of the interests of particular cultural groups.\n\nConvinced that they would be unable to redirect nationalism toward their own ends, many of the most open-minded segments of society long ago gave up on the fight to determine its meaning. In countries like Germany and the United States, advocacy for the victims of prejudice has increasingly bled into a belief that the dark chapters of those countries\u2019 history make any form of nationalism deeply suspect. Instead of exhorting their fellow citizens to live up to their nations\u2019 highest ideals, many activists seem content with denouncing past and present injustices. This has allowed the bigots and racists to bend the meaning of the nation to their own sinister ends.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s time to fight back. Nationalism can, and should, be reclaimed for liberals.\n\nA few political leaders have made a valiant start. Barack Obama has been an especially persuasive advocate of the idea that Americans should focus on what unites rather than what divides us and that the symbolism of the nation can inspire hope, even as we reckon with the injustices of American history. \u201cWhat greater expression of faith in the American experiment than this,\u201d Mr. Obama marveled as he stood on the spot in Selma, Ala. where civil rights protesters were beaten in 1965. \u201cWhat greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished, that we are strong enough to be self-critical, that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is in our power to remake this nation to more closely align with our highest ideals?\u201d\n\nCampaigning for France\u2019s presidency last year, Emmanuel Macron expressed inclusive patriotism in an even more explicit form. \u201cI see Armenians, Italians, Algerians, Moroccans, Tunisians,\u201d he said at a rally in Marseille, a diverse city in southern France, \u201cBut what do I see? I see the people of Marseille! What do I see? I see the people of France!\u201d This, he added in an explicit repudiation of the exclusive nationalism propagated by the far-right National Front party, \u201cis what it means to be proud to be French!\u201d\n\nAmerican \u2014 and to a lesser degree European \u2014 political culture is pregnant with the symbols of inclusive patriotism. But while we have plenty of history to build on, we must also recognize that we are fighting to establish a kind of society for which there is no clear precedent.\n\nIn the United States, the model had once been a melting pot. But asking individuals to conform to one unified culture puts the price of admission to the nation too high. In Canada, the model is often said to be that of a salad bowl, in which the overall dish is enriched by the great variety of individual ingredients. But we can now see that this may be an overly idealized image of a society in which people feel that they have little in common across ethnic and religious divides.\n\nThere may not be a perfect culinary metaphor for the kind of country inclusive nationalists seek to create. But its contours should be obvious. It is a state in which all members have the same rights and opportunities irrespective of the group into which they are born or the culture to which they belong. It is a society in which people feel that they have something important in common because they seek to govern themselves together, pledge to help one another in an hour of need and recognize that these shared commitments are ultimately more consequential than any difference of color or creed. And it is a culture that does not shy away from celebrating the nobility of this collective identity \u2014 embracing the nation\u2019s flag not because we claim never to have failed our compatriots in the past but because we aspire to realize a common future fair to all.\n\nIt would be tempting to say that this kind of patriotism has little in common with the nationalism that is now ascendant around the world. Patriotism, some philosophers argue, should be understood as an innocent love of country that is inclusive at home and cooperative abroad. Nationalism, by contrast, excludes other ethnicities and stands in competition with the interests of other countries.\n\nBut it is too clever by half to pretend that we can safely stoke the good aspects of patriotism without ever running the danger of exacerbating the worst aspects of nationalism. For the kind of patriotism I am proposing is not a completely different form of collective identity; it is, rather, one that proudly stands in competition with the exclusionary politics on display from Washington to Moscow to Beijing.\n\nNationalism is like a half-wild beast. As long as it remains under our control, it can be of tremendous use. But if we abandon it, others are sure to step in, prodding and baiting the beast to bring out its most ferocious side. For all the well-founded misgivings about it, we have little choice but to domesticate it as best we can.", "keywords": ["identity", "form", "nation", "liberals", "political", "patriotism", "common", "reclaim", "society", "religious", "collective", "nationalism"], "polarity": 0.14129125602529854, "subjectivity": 0.47932204517310895},

In young adult literature in particular, inventive, international stories told in newly empowered women\u2019s voices are claiming their rightful place at the table. Take these five new Y.A. books, ranging from fantasy to realistic fiction to memoir. In these authors\u2019 hands, non-Western sensibilities might reign in a vivid and original Yoruban religion-based world, or classical settings might be reinterpreted to create a universe in which beauty is not tied to race. A heartbreaking fictional front row seat to the Syrian refugee emergency is offset by a humorous true tale of growing up an Iranian-American immigrant without a green card.

So do Y.A. readers, when it comes to seeing exhilaratingly new kinds of characters sharing space.\n\nIn Dhonielle Clayton\u2019s lavish fantasy THE BELLES (Freeform, $17.99; ages 14 to 17), a thing of beauty is only temporary. The decadent island society of Orl\u00e9ans is home to a select group of sisters born with the disconcerting ability to perform plastic surgery without the plastic. As \u201cdescendants of the goddess of beauty,\u201d the Belles have a fuzzily explained magical \u201carcana\u201d in their blood that allows them to temporarily change the physical appearance of the native Gris, who are cursed with gray skin and red eyes. After a childhood of training, the teenage Belles are introduced to upper-class society and tasked with transforming the hair, skin and bone structure of the race-fluid rich and royal. But when the rebellious Belle Camellia uncovers a plot by the truly vile Princess Sophia to enslave her and her sisters, she sows the seeds of a grass-roots revolution that is bound to blossom more fully in the inevitable sequel.\n\nPhoto\n\nClayton, a co-founder of the We Need Diverse Books organization, has created an opulent mash-up setting, which seems to be a cherry-picked combination of 18th-century France, Japan and the antebellum American South. If it never quite coalesces into a seamless cultural whole, readers seduced by the page-turning palace intrigue and the vivid food and clothing descriptions won\u2019t notice or care.\n\nMagic also lies dormant in the platelets of chosen teenagers in the Nigerian-American Tomi Adeyemi\u2019s debut, CHILDREN OF BLOOD AND BONE (Holt, $18.99; ages 12 and up). But these diviners are no debutantes. Born with snow white hair and deep brown skin in the imaginary country of Or\u00efsha, young diviners morph into mighty, magic-wielding maji, or magicians, at 13. For centuries they relied on their powers (which Adeyemi based on aspects of the religion of the Yoruban people of West Africa). All that ended when the nonmagical King Saran ordered the slaughter of all adult majis. But when a mysterious scroll falls into the hands of Amari, a defiant princess, and Z\u00e9lie, a tenacious diviner warrior, the two young women set out on a thrilling, death-defying journey to restore magic and take back the throne.\n\nPhoto\n\nBlack Girl Magic, indeed! It\u2019s no surprise that this epic trilogy opener has already been optioned for film. Full of cinematic action sequences (the most memorable of them set almost entirely underwater and employing an army of the dead) and creatures worthy of Star Wars (horse-size \u201clionaires\u201d have saber teeth and horns), it storms the boundaries of the imagination. Yet it also confronts the conscience. Adeyemi\u2019s brutally depicted war between the noble, lighter-skinned kosidans and the enslaved, darker-skinned majis poses thought-provoking questions about race, class and authority that hold up a warning mirror to our sharply divided society.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Tareq is a Syrian refugee whose perilous journey is narrated by the voice of Destiny, characterized as a kindly, prosaic entity. After Tareq\u2019s mother, grandmother and four of his siblings are killed by a bomb, he and his father flee to Turkey with his remaining sister, Susan. They hopscotch from Turkey to Greece, Serbia, Slovenia, Austria and finally to Germany, where he finds a fragile safety. Along the way he witnesses beheadings and drownings, but also experiences the kindness of aid workers like Alexia, an American student. Abawi, a foreign news correspondent, does an admirable job of showing the grim horror of refugee life. But her efforts are occasionally undermined by cartoonish villains (\u201cYou tink you will be saved? Who will save you? Captain America is not real, just movies\u201d) and by some of Destiny\u2019s well-meaning but obvious platitudes: \u201cWhen you truly love someone, their life means more to you than your own.\u201d These interruptions may pull readers out of the story, though perhaps that distance is necessary for adolescents trying to process something as bleak and overwhelming as the Syrian refugee crisis.\n\nPhoto\n\nOf course, once refugees finally arrive in their adopted country, new problems arise. Until she was 13, Sara Saedi, an Iranian-American television writer and the author of the memoir AMERICANIZED: Rebel Without a Green Card (Random House, $17.99, ages 12 and up), was cheerfully oblivious of her family\u2019s immigration status. After her older sister breaks the news that they are \u201cillegal,\u201d Saedi suffers through the usual teenage rites of passage at her Silicon Valley high school (unibrow management, pimple wars, pot smoking) with the added pressure of possible deportation hanging over her head. Saedi adroitly and humorously uses these universal pubescent ordeals to contextualize Iranian culture and the immigrant experience. A memory of being teased about her eyebrow in ninth grade expands into a discussion of beauty norms: When her mother praises her for being hairless, \u201cshe meant by Persian woman standards. I was still hairy by everyone else\u2019s standards.\u201d And she has the sobering realization that pot is a privilege American teenagers can enjoy, but not undocumented kids: \u201cIf I got caught, I\u2019d have a criminal record that could be grounds for deportation.\u201d Very funny but never flippant, Saedi mixes \u201990s pop culture references, adolescent angst and Iranian history into an intimate, informative narrative that thoroughly defies current divisive views on immigration.\n\nPhoto\n\nMary H.K. Choi\u2019s blushingly tender and piquant debut novel, EMERGENCY CONTACT (Simon & Schuster, $17.99; ages 14 and up), about two isolated, misfit college students from Austin who fall in love via text message explores our emotional rather than geographical divides. In \u201cEmergency Contact,\u201d a Korean-American would-be writer named Penny keeps everyone at a distance, the result of living with a single, oversharing mom she calls \u201cthe equivalent of \u2026 human glitter.\u201d But when she rescues Sam, a half-German, half-Polish student filmmaker, from the sidewalk during a panic attack, she becomes his \u201cemergency contact,\u201d and he hers. Their charged, initial banter on text soon develops into increasingly personal exchanges about art, death, unstable moms and pregnant ex-girlfriends. Yet their burgeoning bond keeps stalling out. Burned by past relationships and millennial-ly tethered to their devices, they struggle to connect romantically IRL. Sam \u201ccouldn\u2019t imagine the space Penny would take up in his life if she sprang out of his phone,\u201d and Penny admits \u201cSam was her phone and her phone was Sam.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nChoi, a culture correspondent for HBO\u2019s Vice News, inserts timely issues like sexual assault, cultural appropriation and even DACA into her characters\u2019 intimate conversations, but it is her examination of digital vs. F2F communication that feels the most immediate.

She takes comfort from local efforts like a project in Utica, N.Y., where Bosnian Muslim immigrants and local Unitarian Christians watched a Super Bowl together. She applauds aggressive racial integration programs like those run by the American military. She cites her own teaching experience in small seminars at Yale, where students from divergent backgrounds overcame disagreements to achieve mutual respect, sometimes even friendship.\n\nPhoto\n\nYet the scholar in Chua acknowledges that these individual experiences offer less of a social lesson than she would wish.\n\n\u201cStudies show that minimal or superficial exposure to out-group members can actually worsen group division. \u2026 Negative interactions with people from other groups also increase group hostility. So merely putting members of different groups in the same space is not enough and indeed can aggravate political tribalism.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Chua falls back on the very attitude to which she turned her sharply skeptical gaze at the beginning of the book: the conviction that the United States was, is and will remain an exceptional nation, different from all the others. In her introduction, Chua remarked that the United States as a supertribal entity indifferent to ethnicity and culture became at best a partial reality only a generation ago. By book\u2019s end, however, the battered ideal has been polished and refurbished.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Will we, telling ourselves \u2018These immigrants are different,\u2019 be the weak link, the first generation to fail? Will we forget who we are?\u201d That\u2019s inspiring, and even more so are the citations of Martin Luther King Jr., Lin-Manuel Miranda and Langston Hughes that finish the book.\n\nInspiring \u2014 but not wholly reassuring. A lot of the interest of \u201cPolitical Tribes\u201d comes from the strong sense it emanates of an author arguing with herself. Chua both condemns tribalism and respects its power. She insists that the United States alone of nations among the earth has often transcended it \u2014 and then presents impressive contrary evidence from the past and the present. Chua reckons with the many tribalisms of the American past: ethnic, religious and racial. She hopes for a future in which tribalism fades \u2014 even as she mercilessly details its accumulating strength.\n\nAs Chua notes, tribes can coalesce out of previously unrelated pieces. Immigrants to Europe from North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia \u2014 of different languages, ethnicities, folkways and religious practices \u2014 raised children who created for themselves a new identity as post-ethnic Muslims. ISIS, as Chua mordantly observes, is in its own way a melting pot, bringing together young men and women from across Europe, Asia and the Americas to fight for a new ideology. She quotes a New York Times article about young British girls lured to ISIS. For them, \u201cIslam is punk rock.\u201d\n\nTribes can be created by fission as well as by fusion. Chua suggests that in the United States, divisions that would once have been understood as class divides have been reinterpreted in our time as cultural, even when they are not ethnic. \u201cWhite Americans often hold their biggest disdain for other white Americans \u2014 the ones on the opposite side of the cultural divide.\u201d\n\nThese fast-evolving and ever-changing identities may look contingent from the outside. They feel overwhelmingly powerful to those inside. Chua repeatedly scolds American policymakers for underestimating the importance of ethnocultural identity in Vietnam in the 1960s, Venezuela in the 1990s and Afghanistan in the 2000s. Through her book pulses an evident worry that tribal claims are now overpowering national ones within the United States. If she cannot quite bring herself to make her own anxieties explicit \u2014 or figure out what if anything to do to address them \u2014 she is hardly alone.

Underwood Archives/Getty Images\n\n\u201cOur nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white \u2013 separate and unequal.\u201d\n\nFifty years ago, on March 1, 1968, these were the grim words of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, called the Kerner Commission after its chairman, Gov. Otto Kerner of Illinois.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson had established the commission to examine the disorders and violent protests in Detroit, Newark and well over 100 other American cities during the summer of 1967, and earlier. What it found was searing. \u201cWhat white Americans have never fully understood \u2013 but what the Negro can never forget \u2013 is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto,\u201d the commission concluded. \u201cWhite institutions created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it.\u201d\n\nMostly moderate and mostly white men, the members of the bipartisan panel carried the imprimatur of the political establishment. Their recommendations attracted widespread public debate. The paperback edition of the report sold over two million copies.\n\nOccupied by the Vietnam War and concerned about the legacy of his Great Society domestic agenda, Johnson distanced himself from the \u201ctwo societies\u201d warning. But the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Robert Kennedy strongly endorsed the commission\u2019s findings and recommendations before they were assassinated and before more protests erupted during that traumatic year of 1968.\n\nThe Kerner Commission recommended \u201cmassive and sustained\u201d investments in jobs and education to reduce poverty, inequality and racial injustice.

Today, the top 1 percent receive 52 percent of all new income. Rich people are healthier and live longer. They get a better education, which produces greater gains in income.

I\u2019d love to jump right in and hear your aspirations for Prairie View. What do you hope to accomplish in your time as president? I assume you had many offers to lead other colleges. Why was Prairie View different?\n\nRuth Simmons: Well, I\u2019m a native of Texas, and one of the things that I did when I returned to Houston after I retired from Brown was think about the ways I could use my experience to help the community. I started with small ventures in the city, but I hadn\u2019t thought really that another university would be in my life. But when I was approached by Prairie View, I thought immediately about its significant impact on my brother, who went there. And what Dillard did for me.\n\nI grew up in a segregated neighborhood in Grapeland, Tex., with very little experience with the world. The transition that Dillard enabled for me was extremely valuable. As an undergraduate, I began to grow a sense of confidence that helped me move from a fairly insular environment to a bigger stage when I went to graduate school.\n\nMy aspirations for Prairie View are to essentially make sure the university is continuing to do the same thing for students today that it did for my brother \u2014 and Dillard did for me. And that is to offer the advantage of a strong education that will prepare students for the careers they want, in a social and cultural context that helps them develop the confidence to perform after graduation.\n\nAs president, that means focusing on time-honored strategies to success that apply to universities everywhere: worrying about the faculty who are recruited here, the campus experience, and whether we are providing the leadership and internship opportunities that students need. It means worrying about the reputation of the university. It\u2019s obviously a much more competitive world today than it was when I was a student, but the underlying work to move the university to a level of achievement that makes students and alumni proud is the same.\n\nM.J.: What do you see as some of the major challenges facing historically black colleges and universities?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: The general challenge for H.B.C.U.s is not unlike the problem many universities face today, and that is the financial model. Being tuition dependent has become a large problem for all universities. H.B.C.U.s are dependent on raising money, but that is a reality that most universities obviously face. So it very much depends on the question of whether the schools have a good-enough foundation because of secure financing. When it comes to the federal government\u2019s role in supporting H.B.C.U.s, I think we don\u2019t yet understand the extent to which they will be affected by the changes in Washington today. To say that many are not hopeful in this moment is an understatement. We just don\u2019t know.\n\nFrankly, that\u2019s why I advocate for developing enough financial independence to secure the future of our institutions. That means looking for different revenue streams, looking to increase our ability to raise funds and finding alternate programs that help to bring more income into our university. The only strategy cannot be to persistently raise tuition, making college outside the reach of many families.\n\nM.J.: You\u2019ve led several institutions that are all very different from each other, and the topic of leadership is something you\u2019ve talked a lot about. In another interview with The Times you said that it\u2019s much easier to lead people \u201cif you convey the underlying principles.\u201d Can you elaborate?\n\nR.S.: One thing that I\u2019ve learned is that the perceptions of what it takes to be a leader are often based on prototypical models that don\u2019t have much truth in reality. People look at the institutions that I have led and they see dissimilarities. I see similarities. When people think in terms of leadership, they\u2019re often thinking about the kind of specific skills needed for different types of enterprises. I think of leadership as more of a disposition \u2014 the ability to step into a situation to learn about the history of the enterprise, the opportunities that it faces, the culture that exists and the people who are served by it. To look at all of that, to listen to stakeholders and then to think about how that enterprise or institution should best be served. There is no one model of leadership if you approach it that way. What I have tried to do wherever I go is to start where the institution is rather than try to import particularly rigid constructs from other places. In that sense, I think a leader is more than anything else a facilitator. A person who is able to come in to show a community a picture of what it is, to provide some insight into what it could be \u2014 how it could be different or improved perhaps \u2014 and then enlist the help of people who are there and others who support that institution in order to move forward together.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

I don\u2019t see that. I think leadership is a community affair.\n\nM.J.: That makes sense. So how do you approach educating the current generation of students at Prairie View to lead in the way you described?\n\nR.S.: People today are fond of leadership programs that theorize about the profile and tenets of leadership. And students anxiously get involved in those programs. I rather think that our entire campuses are incubators of leadership even without the formality of such programs because if we\u2019re doing what we should be doing, we are acclimating students to an environment in which they have to learn to work with others who are very different from themselves. And that seems to me to be the first requirement of leadership. To actually learn to work with people in a respectful and inclusive way is inordinately important. A campus provides one of the best opportunities for people to be able to do that because you sit in class alongside people whom you initially don\u2019t know. You are discussing your ideas, having people respond to them and often rejecting what you\u2019re saying. You are joining organizations that have certain aims that are being advanced by the collective, so you\u2019re learning how to facilitate. You are asked to step into leadership roles either through student government or organizations. Even in the classroom context you might play a leadership role. You have to learn to express yourself, to be convincing, to write out your ideas, to be more thoughtful than you\u2019d ordinarily be. All of those things are components of leadership.\n\nM.J.: Some would argue that social media, or perhaps disagreements over the concept of safe spaces, have made it more challenging for people to come together and to work together.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: Yeah, I would say that people frequently say that, but that has certainly not been my experience. I would say that in my days as a student, the tensions were higher, the disagreements were greater, the separation among us was certainly more pronounced. And people are kind of inventing a new narrative, that things are so much worse today than they were in the past. I don\u2019t buy that. I think we have new terminology, because the modern sciences of psychology and sociology and so forth and modern media have enabled us to peer into areas that we were not able to see as easily as before. And so when you have social media and all of the ways in which people can now say whatever they want to say \u2014 in an unartful or offensive way \u2014 that turns the volume up to be sure. But it doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t there before.\n\nI would say that the current situation ought to give us much more practice in how to engage with each other because it is not underground. It\u2019s out front, it\u2019s in the open. The media today and the things that are being reported should be upsetting or troubling to students, my goodness. But it may be an even better opportunity to engage students.\n\nAs a teacher, as an educator, I would say these times are especially fertile for teaching the skills that are needed in a world in which there are many types of people, many perspectives and so forth. Students don\u2019t need to feel silenced by the current situation. When students at Brown came to me and said, you know, they were hurt because somebody asked them about their hair, and they were tired of that and they didn\u2019t want any part of it, I would say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s just too bad!\u201d Somebody asked you about your hair, tell them about your hair. You are in college not to hide from that. You\u2019re there to teach the world about yourself, you\u2019re there to learn about others and to teach them about who you are. So I\u2019d rather think this whole notion of protecting people from that is something that we have to take in hand and deal with. And help students see the opportunity in that because if they engage with people who have those kinds of perspectives, they are going to be much stronger in the end than if they run away.\n\nM.J.: Do you see the situation differently for students at H.B.C.U.s? You mentioned that Dillard gave you the space to learn and build confidence before heading to graduate school.\n\nR.S.: There is a narrative that many people have for H.B.C.U.s. People see them as a monolith, or only see them as filling a gap that exists for African-Americans. H.B.C.U.s are not a brand. They are institutions with a certain history \u2014 they were originally set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for education \u2014 but they are not all alike, and are very diverse in what they offer.\n\nPrairie View, for example, is the second-oldest public institution of higher education in the state of Texas. It was set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for ex-slaves and whites. For a long time it provided educational opportunities for black students that wouldn\u2019t have been open to them otherwise. In nursing, architecture, engineering and other STEM fields at a time when many blacks were not able to go into those areas, the university was able to facilitate the entry of blacks into those professions.\n\nM.J.: Yes, this is something that Nikole Hannah-Jones has written about for The New York Times Magazine, in particular how Xavier University of Louisiana sends more black students to medical school than almost any other college in the country. I read that Prairie View has many more students who graduate with degrees in architecture and engineering.\n\nR.S.: Yes, going to Dillard is not like going to Prairie View. So the student who chooses to go to one H.B.C.U. may not find another appealing. That has to do with the unique features of the place, the academic culture and so on, the traditions. All of that makes a big difference.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen I went off to college, I was just trying to find a place where I could be a student without impediments that in that day and time were fairly widely known to be substantial if you enrolled in a majority-white institution. There was no question that in 1963, if you went off to college in the South, you had to be very careful about where you studied. The racial dynamic was very challenging at that time. One of the things I\u2019m learning now is that many of the students I speak to at Prairie View today have the same kinds of thoughts that I had those many years ago. They ask themselves, where can I feel comfortable so that I don\u2019t have to worry about anything but my academic work? So certainly that plays a factor in why students apply to H.B.C.U.s. And for some H.B.C.U.s, applications are way up. But if you reach the point where you think that a category of institutions are the right choice for you \u2014 going to an H.B.C.U. just to go to an H.B.C.U. \u2014 then you\u2019re not thinking broadly enough.\n\nM.J.: As you look across the landscape of higher education, what other challenges do college students face today?\n\nR.S.: I guess I worry a lot about our students having the skills and the experience to promote respectful interactions with a wide-ranging group of people. Students can be quite passionate about what they see on the national scene and how sometimes dangerous they think it is \u2014 how unpleasant it is and so forth. But we\u2019ve got to try to find a way on our campuses not to taint the national picture as hopeless, or as being antithetical to anything that we can think of as good and admirable. The last thing we want is for our students to bow out and decide that it isn\u2019t worth trying to do anything about a hopeless situation.\n\nAnd I do think that civility goes hand in hand with being hopeful. Hopeful that the next person you meet you will be able to converse with you in a respectful way. Hopeful that the next election cycle is going to give you a chance to be engaged and able to do something that makes you feel a sense of your own agency. Hopeful that the things will get better rather than worse.\n\nSo much of what we have to do on our campuses is really to hold open the possibility for people that civil society will in the end right itself \u2014 if enough of us are engaged. I am so thankful every day for the fact that I grew up in a time when nobody thought blacks would be able to be integrated into American society, they would never be able to hold important positions, they\u2019d never be respected intellectually, they\u2019d never be able to do the things that they are now able to do. So why did we persist? And why did we continue to work toward betterment? We did it because we had people working with us in education who were ever hopeful that things were going to change. So I like to say to educators, you have to be always projecting to students that civility enables hopefulness to be ever resurgent.", "keywords": ["leadership", "generation", "think", "cultivating", "view", "students", "things", "say", "dont", "ruth", "simmons", "able", "today", "college", "prairie"], "polarity": 0.18839701321015756, "subjectivity": 0.47766767453623127}
