There are no plans for Ms. Trump to meet with anyone from North Korea during her three-day visit, though an official declined to rule out the possibility.\n\nMs. Trump will travel with the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, and Allison Hooker, a National Security Council official who specializes in Korean affairs, among others. The council has briefed Ms. Trump about the political situation on the Korean Peninsula, according to officials.\n\nAdministration officials said she was fully prepared to discuss Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy with Mr. Moon, the South Korean news media or with North Korean officials, should she run into any.\n\nSimply by virtue of her age and background, Ms. Trump will project a more accessible image than Mr. Pence, 58. He arrived with a directive from Mr. Trump to blunt the propaganda campaign of North Korea, which has used the Olympics as a kind of olive branch to the South.\n\nWhile the president authorized Mr. Pence to meet with the North Koreans, he insisted that any meeting be held privately, away from cameras, and that Mr. Pence deliver the same harsh message in private that he delivered in public.\n\nMr. Pence reinforced his hard-line image by remaining seated during the opening ceremony when the audience stood for the unified Korean Olympic team. He ignored Ms. Kim and another top North Korean official, Kim Yong-nam, who were seated behind him in Mr. Moon\u2019s box.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmerican officials said they believed these gestures \u2014 on top of Mr. Pence\u2019s threat of new sanctions against the North, which Mr. Pence delivered in Japan, on his way to South Korea \u2014 caused the North Koreans to rethink the meeting with the vice president.\n\nAdministration officials said they were pleased with Mr. Pence\u2019s unyielding approach.

But he agreed to consider sending a family member, like the first lady, Melania Trump, or his daughter Ivanka. Last month, officials said, the president settled on his daughter, who is also his senior adviser.\n\nIn some ways, Ms. Trump is a natural fit to attend the Winter Games. She is an avid skier, a sport she picked up from her mother, Ivana, who skied competitively for what was then Czechoslovakia. Ms. Trump, friends say, has watched the Olympics with her daughter, Arabella, taking particular interest in the super-G event.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring the transition, Ms. Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, became involved in negotiations between the International Olympic Committee and Los Angeles over that city\u2019s bid to host the Games in 2028.\n\nIn addition to Ms. Trump and Ms. Sanders, the American delegation will include Senator James E. Risch, a Republican from Idaho who is in line to become the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, if Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee sticks to his decision to retire.\n\nIt will also include Gen.

It is not part of the Pyeongchang Games. But in all likelihood, ready or not, it will be on the Olympic menu in 2022 in Beijing. Its sudden emergence is giving athletes and federations something of a free shot at Olympic medals.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe winner of the two-woman competition, and the first United States national champion, was Nina Lussi, 23, a ski jumper.\n\n\u201cI have a bit of a background in Nordic combined,\u201d said Lussi, a native of Lake Placid, N.Y., where the competition was held. \u201cWe had Nordic combined races at the junior level up to the age of about 16.

As a result, she started the cross-country race with a lead of four and a half minutes. Though she skied almost three minutes slower than Armstrong, Lussi held on for the win.\n\nBecause the event came before significant snowfall in Lake Placid, the cross-country race was held using roller skis. \u201cI took some lessons, \u2018learn to roller ski for dummies,\u2019\u201d Lussi said. \u201cI was having trouble breathing on a very steep uphill.

The first Continental Cup event, the level below World Cup, was held in January in Norway, with 14 entrants (Armstrong placed 12th). A World Cup will follow in 2020, with a world championship in 2021 and the Olympics in 2022.

I\u2019ve been waiting about 13 years. When I was 10 or 11, people said wouldn\u2019t it be cool because you\u2019re so good\u201d at Nordic combined. \u201cHad there been women\u2019s Nordic combined when I was younger, I would have been a Nordic combined athlete.\u201d\n\nShe said that many ski jumpers could have the ability to succeed at Nordic combined because of their training background. \u201cSki jumpers, for sure, they try to get you on cross-country skis,\u201d she said. \u201cIt helps with balance and coordination.\u201d\n\nOne complication of Nordic combined is that the ideal body types for the two elements of the discipline tend to be different. \u201cSki jumping, you want to be light; cross-country, you want to be fast,\u201d Geraghty-Moats said. Ideal Nordic combined athletes, she said, would be \u201ccross-country skiers with leaner builds.\u201d\n\nWomen\u2019s Nordic combined is taking an unconventional path to the Olympics. It is not a sport that has bubbled up from the grass roots to force its way into the Games. Instead a top-down edict about gender equality has caused national federations to scramble to start programs.\n\nWomen are almost certain to have Nordic combined as a medal sport at the Olympics in four years.

While Russia has denied any such scheme, Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s claims were independently verified and led to the ban on Russia at the 2018 Winter Olympics.\n\nPhoto\n\nDuring the course of filming, Mr. Fogel changed the location of his production office four times, used burner phones to thwart surveillance attempts, edited the film on hard drives rather than a hackable server, and moved Dr. Rodchenkov to four different safe houses.

It might be a stretch to assume that academy voters are paying much mind to Russian news sites, but Mr. Fayyad believes that detractors, in their fervor to discredit the White Helmets, are also aiming to derail his film\u2019s Oscar chances, something he is trying to offset by sounding the alarm.\n\nMr. Fayyad is from the countryside outside Aleppo and, in March 2011, was working on another film, about the 1982 massacre in the city of Hama, when Syria\u2019s civil uprising began.

Image Evgenia Medvedeva was in second place after Wednesday's short program, behind a younger Russian teammate. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nGANGNEUNG, South Korea \u2014 What must it be like to be 18 and crowned Olympic champion in all the predictions, only to find that someone younger may be better? And what if that someone is a friend and partner you train with every day?\n\nLast fall, Evgenia Medvedeva of Russia was a consensus pick to win the women\u2019s figure skating competition at the Winter Games. She was already a two-time world champion, undefeated in two years, increasingly graceful as an artist and technically savvy in her jumping. But skating can be a ruthless sport. And now Medvedeva\u2019s time may have gone before it arrived.\n\nShe could still win gold on Friday, skating as Tolstoy\u2019s tragic Anna Karenina. She sits in second place, only 1.3 points behind her training partner in Moscow, the 15-year-old Alina Zagitova. It would be premature to count Medvedeva out. But there is something awakening in Zagitova. She defeated Medvedeva last month at the European championships. In Wednesday\u2019s short program, Medvedeva set a world record for points. Ten minutes later, Zagitova broke it.\n\nStill, Medvedeva will be a central figure at these Games, gold medal or not.\n\nIt was Medvedeva who helped to argue \u2014 successfully \u2014 in December before the International Olympic Committee that not all Russian athletes should be banned from these Games because of systematic doping orchestrated at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.\n\nShe laughs often and speaks comfortably with reporters in both Russian and English. Her career path was set at age 11, when Medvedeva competed for the first time at the Russian national championships. \u201cI realized then, this is what I wanted,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to be good.\u201d\n\nUntil Medvedeva lost to Zagitova at the European championships, she had been remarkably consistent, undefeated since November 2015. When she fell on a double axel in a competition in Moscow in October, it was such a rare and unexpected spill that Medvedeva called it a moment of \u201cmoral weakness.\u201d\n\nEvgenia MEDVEDEVA RUS Free Skate Rostelecom Cup 2017 Credit Video by Brau Avitia\n\n\u201cShe is such a fierce competitor; I love that,\u201d said Brian Orser, the coach of the two-time Olympic men\u2019s champion Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan. \u201cThere\u2019s a very youthful passion about her skating. She\u2019ll find a little story and she embraces it and puts it out there. It\u2019s not over the top, super-sophisticated stuff; it\u2019s stuff for an 18-year-old.\u201d\n\nAway from the rink, Medvedeva describes herself as a homebody who finds calm after practice by going to her room in her family\u2019s apartment, closing the door and reading a book or searching the internet. The television stays off; the only noise permitted is the bubbling of her aquarium.\n\n\u201cEverything is without sound,\u201d she said.\n\nHer mother is her biggest \u2014 and most nervous \u2014 supporter, so the two of them have a pact. Medvedeva skates and her mother neither attends any competitions nor watches them on television. \u201cProbably our connection is so strong, Mom\u2019s anxiety comes to me even at a distance,\u201d Medvedeva told the Russian newspaper Sport-Express in November.\n\nThere has been plenty of anxiety lately. In November, Medvedeva revealed that she had a broken bone in her right foot, which was placed in a cast. She missed training time and two important competitions, including the Russian national championships. At the European championships, she appeared somewhat tentative on her jumps and clearly was not yet fully fit.\n\nMedvedeva seems recovered now, but things are different. Situations are reversed. Zagitova has caught and perhaps surpassed her. In Zagitova, Medvedeva sees her old self, new to international success, fearless, febrile with possibility. And she has come to realize that the minute she is not at her best, she is vulnerable.\n\nIn the last couple of years, Medvedeva has made some concessions that teenagers do not often have to. She said she can no longer eat what she wants after 6 p.m. as she could before; if she gains weight, jumping could become more difficult. The rigors of the sport demand that \u201cyou have to control yourself anytime,\u201d she said.\n\nBut some things are beyond her control, like Zagitova\u2019s ascent in a year from world junior champion to Olympic gold-medal contender. The two are friends. Medvedeva has lent skating costumes to Zagitova and Zagitova lists Medvedeva as one of her sporting heroes.

And from the look of things, they got wholeheartedly into the spirit of sexy self-presentation and image manipulation central to the culture of Instagram \u2014 a fact as apparently true of those competing in obscure disciplines as the stars of marquee sports.\n\nSure, Lindsey Vonn was early to the demands of a social media era, appearing on the slopes at both the World Cup tour and the Winter Olympics in a full face of fashionable and camera-ready makeup. And Ms. Vonn\u2019s marketing savvy has long proved effective, to judge by her endorsements with Red Bull, Rolex, GoPro, Bounty Paper Towels and others, along with her huge Instagram following.\n\nPhoto\n\nYet, while commercial jackpots may not be in store for someone like the Norwegian ski jumper Robert Johansson (IG: @rbrt_johansson), a 27-year-old ginger with a slicked back-and-undercut Billyburg haircut and curling porn-star mustache, he was a stellar example of an athlete embracing style on a global platform just for fun.\n\nThe same is true, of course, of Mr. Johansson\u2019s countryman Thomas Ulsrud and fellow members of the curling team, whose buff bodies have been turned into a hottie calendar, while the Loudmouth brand trousers they debuted at the Winter Olympics in Vancouver in 2010 \u2014 plaid, polka-dot, floral and checked patterns reminiscent of Crazy Uncle Mort \u2014 have since evolved into one of the wittier continuing fashion statements in sports.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story The Open Thread Fashion Newsletter A look from across The New York Times at the forces that shape the dress codes we share, with Vanessa Friedman as your personal shopper.

Take the slopestyle snowboarder Kyle Mack, a United States team member who, though he failed to land certain tricks in early qualifying runs, competed in bum-baring saggers, giving a nod to the hip-hop styling that underpins a once renegade sport.\n\nPhoto\n\nOr consider the competitors in skeleton, the terrifying event where athletes shoot headfirst down a sinuous ice track on a sled without brakes at speeds exceeding 80 miles an hour. In their skintight superhero bodysuits and face-obscuring helmets, skeleton athletes are difficult to distinguish from one another. So competitors like Joseph Luke Cecchini of Italy customized the helmet, in his case with an airbrushed image of a flaming skull. Katie Uhlaender of the United States chose a bald eagle for her headgear, and Barrett Martineau of Canada a fanged and snarling bear.\n\nUniquely among those competing at the games, ice skaters have latitude to forgo uniforms for costumes and, as anyone who has seen \u201cI, Tonya\u201d knows, the results can range from laughable to deeply sad. At these Winter Games, however, few ice skating costumes have looked like outtakes from a streetwalker\u2019s trousseau.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYes, there has been abundant glitter, plenty of sparkle, volumes of beading, enough chiffon and \u201cnude\u201d-colored illusion effects to tent a parking lot. Yet there have also been examples, like the beaded ombr\u00e9 lilac costumes worn by the German gold medalists Aljona Savchenko and Bruno Massot, that demonstrated how closely athletes have been monitoring the latest runway looks.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis has been a year of sparkle on the catwalks, light glinting and fragmenting off sequined and beaded jackets and dresses at houses including Versace and Gucci and off belts and bags and shoes and boots, like the crystal-encrusted Saint Laurent model that sells for $10,000 (if you can get them). No Kirakira+ has been needed at the 2018 Winter Games, where it sometimes seems as if a filter for glinting cartoon starlight has already been applied. That, too, has been part of the fun of this Olympics, the giddy embrace of the theatricality and flamboyance that were formerly disdained or ridiculed.\n\nWhether channeling the \u201cHunger Games\u201d or Violet Chachki, a winner of \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race,\u201d Johnny Weir, a two-time Olympian who has transformed himself into a knowledgeable, articulate sports commentator, has served throughout these games as stealth ambassador for fashion as an emblem of aspiration and also of his individual brand of gender blur. Much has been of Mr. Weir\u2019s Kewpie doll maquillage, his Birkin bags, his jeweled brooches, his furs, his 13 travel trunks, his Louboutin shoes and elaborate bouffant hairdo.

(Gay Talese revealed in \u201cThe Kingdom and the Power\u201d that he had actually been an army captain, not a colonel, and served in World War I as a trainer of pack animals.) Regardless of his rank, he was fond of barking orders to his underlings, military style.\n\nHe had hired Vinson \u201chesitantly and after considerable soul-searching,\u201d the Times columnist Arthur Daley wrote years later. \u201cHe regretted it the very first day\u201d when he realized that he would not be able to swear as much.\n\nYears later, though, Vinson recalled of her colleagues, \u201cThey soon found out I could outdrink them,\u201d according to one of her skating students, Frank Carroll (who would later coach some of the world\u2019s most renowned skaters).\n\nVinson was not just some celebrity author who swanned in to dash off a few skating articles. She plunged right into the daily grind of a real sportswriter. She amassed 189 bylines in her first 12 months, and covered track, tennis, swimming, lacrosse and horse shows.\n\nUnder the banner \u201cWomen in Sports,\u201d her first column reported on the Curtis Cup matches for amateur golfers and added notes about a fencing exhibition at the Hotel Astor and field hockey in Prospect Park.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven at her young age, her prose reveals that she was a pro, seriously and carefully laying out the news of every event, even if it was low in the sports pecking order. Within the limits of The Times\u2019s strict rules and sometimes stiff house writing style, she managed to impart some flavor to her coverage.\n\nIn reporting on an outdoor swim meet in Manhattan Beach in 1935, she wrote, \u201cIt was not a water hazard but a mental hazard that Miss Rawls had to face in the medley race. For the sprightly, laughing Southerner is literally \u2018frightened to death\u2019 by lightning, and it must have been small comfort to see a telephone pole a block away struck by a bolt and burning merrily away.\u201d\n\nHer bylines almost always appeared over accounts of women\u2019s sports. No one sent Vinson to write about a glamorous event like a bowl game, a prize fight or the World Series (although Carroll says she often attended such events with her male colleagues). Instead, she plied her trade at places like the Heights Casino in Brooklyn for squash, the Pelham Country Club for golf and Jones Beach for archery.\n\nDaley acknowledged that while Vinson was \u201cnever completely accepted\u201d by The Times\u2019s boys\u2019 club, she was eventually \u201cwarily admitted to the gang.\u201d\n\nAmazingly, Vinson juggled full-time sportswriting with full-time athletic pursuits. On Jan. 13, 1936, she reported a squash story from the Cosmopolitan Club in Manhattan. On the 15th, she sailed for Germany and the Winter Olympics on the liner Washington. (It was an era when boat sailings were big news. The Times reported that Sergei Rachmaninoff was also on board; Vinson made the boat by just 10 minutes and forgot her uniform.)\n\nOn Feb. 2, her byline appeared again, over a story about the women\u2019s ski team. On the 13th, she finished fifth in her third Olympics. She also placed fifth in the pairs competition alongside George Hill. On March 3, she was back on the squash beat, reporting from London, and before the month was out she was back reporting on badminton from New York.\n\nVinson wrote her last article for the Times in 1937 (\u201cMiss Amory Victor With Miss Phipps,\u201d on the results of a \u201cScotch foursome\u201d golf match) and began her coaching career.\n\nPhoto\n\nVinson seldom got to show it in her articles about college field hockey, but she was an intellectual powerhouse. Carroll remembers that in the 1950s, \u201cWe drove around a lot to rinks and would discuss the philosophers I was studying at Holy Cross, like Thomas Aquinas. We\u2019d talk about the Latin language, the differences between ecclesiastical Latin and classical Latin. She was one of the most brilliant women I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThey drove so much, Carroll notes, because Vinson was not allowed to teach at her home rink, the Skating Club of Boston. \"She was brutal, and they didn\u2019t like that ... She was a very tough, tough mentor. She demanded discipline.\u201d\n\nVinson kept at writing, penning three books about figure skating and contributing off and on to The Associated Press and Boston Globe.\n\nShe raised two daughters, Maribel and Laurence, and both became elite skaters. (Laurence took after her mother and wrote poetry.) In 1961, mother and daughters, along with 15 other members of the U.S. skating team, died when their 707 jet crashed in Brussels on the way to the world championships in Prague. It was a devastating day for United States skating, and made front page news nationwide.\n\nVinson\u2019s legacy lives on through coaches like Carroll, who trained Michelle Kwan and Evan Lysacek, among others.\n\nAnd through all the women sportswriters who have graced these pages.", "keywords": ["figure", "vinson", "skater", "wrote", "world", "olympic", "women", "reporting", "times", "history", "club", "carroll", "skating", "squash"], "polarity": 0.005648415370637596, "subjectivity": 0.3816097482764149},

About six months ago, President Trump referred to Mr. Moon\u2019s overtures to the North as \u201cappeasement.\u201d Mr. Trump also dismissed Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson\u2019s suggestions of dialogue with the North as premature or a waste of time.\n\nBut it was never clear whether the North itself was interested in talks, preconditions or no. Under President Barack Obama, repeated efforts at opening a back channel to seek dialogue were rebuffed by Pyongyang.\n\nPast American administrations have rewarded North Korea\u2019s decision to begin negotiations by providing food aid and some sanctions relief. But even if there are now no preconditions for talks, the Trump administration still insists that North Korea will not be rewarded for just opening a dialogue.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

While Mr. Pence and Ms. Kim were in South Korea, Mr. Moon\u2019s government publicly called for dialogue between Washington and Pyongyang.\n\nDuring his visit to Asia, Mr. Pence did not rule out a possible meeting, but vowed to use any encounter with the North Koreans to drive home Washington\u2019s demand that Pyongyang \u201conce and for all abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile ambitions.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Pence was reiterating Washington\u2019s position, North Korea stole headlines in the South and beyond with a surprise message of dialogue and reconciliation. On Feb. 10 \u2014 the day Mr. Pence\u2019s office said he was to meet the North Koreans \u2014 Ms. Kim made another surprise announcement: She invited Mr. Moon to visit North Korea for a summit meeting.\n\nSome observers said the North\u2019s charm offensive had won the day, while American officials appeared obstinate and overshadowed.\n\n\u201dThe White House and State are clumsily attempting damage control after Pence\u2019s poor P.R. performance in South Korea last week,\u201d said Lee Sung-yoon, a Korea expert at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.\n\n\u201cThe Pyeongchang Olympics will be remembered as the best Olympic Games ever \u2014 for Pyongyang,\u201d he added.\n\nMr. Pence\u2019s meeting with the North Koreans was to occur after the vice president had warned that the country was about to face the \u201ctoughest and most aggressive\u201d set of United States sanctions yet, though he did not detail what those would be.\n\nHighlighting the difficulty of enforcing even the existing sanctions, Japan on Wednesday said its military had spotted a ship-to-ship transfer of goods at sea that it \u201cstrongly suspects\u201d violates the current United Nations sanctions on North Korea.\n\nThe transfer happened on Friday, when a Japanese surveillance plane and an escort ship spotted a North Korean-flagged tanker alongside another, smaller ship in the waters between China and Japan, Japan\u2019s foreign ministry said.

At 7, he was a snowboarder. He once broke his thumb when it got stuck in a corrugated pipe in a snowboard park. He played football in high school, too, but eventually went just with snowboarding because the schedules conflicted.\n\nBesides, Laura Corning said, \u201cfootball is dangerous.\u201d\n\nMastering big air is all about starting small and making incremental improvements as a snowboarder, the Cornings said. First you try a half turn, then a full turn. Then eventually you\u2019re hitting 1080s, and more. It\u2019s how big air, eventually, doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal.\n\n\u201cWhat you want to do is just put Bubble Wrap on them because you don\u2019t want to see them get hurt or go through the pain,\u201d Laura Corning said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t.

Brook Corning, a mechanical engineer, is the one with risk-taking in his genes.\n\nOnce, when Chris was about 9, his father took him backcountry snowboarding. Brook Corning said that he had to sign \u201cabout a billion waivers\u201d before they could go and that he had to strap a beacon onto Chris so the boy could be found in an avalanche. They were also given shovels and probes, in case they needed to dig out.\n\n\u201cWhen we were hiking across a knife\u2019s edge and there were cliffs on both sides, I thought, \u2018Hmm, maybe this really isn\u2019t a good idea,\u2019\u201d Brook Corning said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, we had so much fun. I\u2019ve always trusted Chris\u2019s athletic ability. It\u2019s astounding.\u201d\n\nHowever, when they came home, exhausted, and described where they had been, Laura Corning was furious.\n\n\u201cI just lost it and might have said a few curse words,\u201d she said. \u201cBasically, I\u2019ve been prepped for this big air and all that crazy stuff my entire parenthood.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nA parenthood that sometimes means watching her son hobbling away after a jump or even being taken off the slope on a stretcher.

I\u2019ll never tire of their skill \u2014 their consummate speed and control \u2014 but this year, as they swept across the ice with gaping mouths to music from the \u201cMoulin Rouge\u201d soundtrack, they ran my red light.\n\nIt\u2019s true that skating isn\u2019t pure dance. It is, though, extraordinary in its own right and can possess the quiet sophistication, musicality and nuance of dance. With Ms. Papadakis and Mr. Cizeron, skating has room to grow. They aren\u2019t merely ice dancers: They dance on the ice, showing how it\u2019s capable of becoming a living canvas, one that curves toward the skater as the skater curves back into it.\n\nIn ice dance, there are no lifts above the head, no heroic jumps. Its power is rooted in a blade\u2019s deep etchings, the angle of plush knee bends and, despite those awkward boots, toes that point and extend the length of a leg to create fluent line. Arms lengthen from the back with fingers that grow along with them. If, in pairs and singles skating, it seems like the air is increasingly being sucked out of routines to make room for more jumps \u2014 it\u2019s worse when they\u2019re crammed into the second half in order to score more points \u2014 ice dance pushes skating to a more poetic place.\n\nPhoto\n\nHow can skaters bring emotion to a blade? How does their musicality play into a seemingly simple essence of motion? A skater moves forward and backward on the inside or outside edge of a blade. In ice dance, this is not rushed but emphasized in strokes that lean and bend to propel a skater from one side of the rink to the other.\n\nIn the singles and pairs world, pristine edges can be forsaken for jumps and lifts, but one skater who pays attention to the details in between is the American Adam Rippon. He has become a media sensation for his outspokenness, but what I love most about him is his skating. He moves like silk. He cares about line; his spins have an endearing lightness, as the arch of his back in his layback \u2014 arguably the most beautiful spin in skating \u2014 attests.\n\nHe skates for himself, the same way Ms. Papadakis and Mr. Cizeron skate \u2014 as if they are in their own world. When I watch them, my mind goes to a Jerome Robbins quote about \u201cDances at a Gathering,\u201d his sublime 1969 ensemble ballet. \u201cYou should never dance anything for the audience,\u201d he said. \u201cIt ruins it if you do. You should dance only to each other. As if the audience weren\u2019t there. It\u2019s very hard.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

But in their free skate program, set to Beethoven\u2019s \u201cMoonlight\u201d Sonata, Ms. Papadakis and Mr. Cizeron expanded the idea of virtuosity with the way they completely tuned in to each other. Often in ice dancing, you keep your eye on the woman; the man, as in the case of Mr. Moir, is there, in part, to show off the woman \u2014 to spark her fire.\n\nBut the lyrical and musical Ms. Papadakis and Mr. Cizeron are more of a slow boil. Moving as one, they are gossamer as they transform the ice into air. Their free dance unfurled gradually and hypnotically, building to feverish spin sequences. One, in which Mr. Cizeron rotated in a sit spin while holding Ms. Papadakis\u2019s extended leg as she opened her right shoulder and head to the ceiling, was a spectacle of position and daring.\n\nAs soon as the piano became subdued and dreamy, their flurry of footwork returned to the quiet hush of the start. As they glided across the ice in whispering strokes, it seemed as if they were no longer skating in an arena, but on a pond.

By the third interval, Goggia was fifth fastest in the field.\n\nAs it turned out, she was just finding her rhythm.

(Her father signed her up for a 30-minute weekly lesson. She did not realize until years later that figure skaters trained six or seven days a week.)\n\nFor two years at the University of California, Berkeley, she was the coxswain \u2014 the person who directs the crew from the stern of the boat \u2014 for the nationally competitive men\u2019s rowing team.\n\nHer experience steering a crew team led her to believe that she might be able to steer a bobsled. The United States women\u2019s bobsled team told her that she was too small to be a bobsledder, but that it was impressed by her athletic background. She eventually took up skeleton \u2014 a headfirst version of luge.\n\nShe began skiing in 2010, after attending the Vancouver Olympics and feeling inspired by the skiers, and doubled down on the event after giving up skeleton. For six years, training in Utah, she would often wake up at 6:30 a.m. to go the gym, then ski for hours. She fit in training around two part-time jobs.\n\nStill, she did not know that she would be heading to South Korea until Jan. 24, when she learned she had qualified. She arrived in Budapest at midnight on the 25th, having brought only her passport, her jacket and the bag she had brought to work that day.\n\nShe said there was some attention she was grateful for: the supportive texts she received from her parents after the event.\n\n\u201cMy dad told me he found my runs really graceful, so I was happy to hear that,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not as familiar with skiing as they are with other sports, but they were happy to see me compete.\u201d", "keywords": ["athletes", "olympic", "heart", "halfpipe", "skier", "york", "womens", "told", "swaney", "elizabeth", "competitors", "viral", "ski", "skiers"], "polarity": 0.16708548903670856, "subjectivity": 0.4607521205082182},

Krushelnytsky passed a drug test on Jan. 22 and several others before that, the Russian officials said. Meldonium, which in 2016 led to a long ban for the tennis star Maria Sharapova, usually stays in the system for months.\n\n\u201cWe express our sincere regret over the fact of the incident,\u201d the Russian officials said in their statement. \u201cAt the same time, the circumstances of the case do not provide any answers to the questions as to how and when meldonium could have gotten into the athlete\u2019s body.\u201d\n\nKrushelnytsky had been at a training camp in Japan before the Games.

Before his programs last week, the American Adam Rippon spent the last minute circling the ice as if he were a short-track skater.\n\n\u201cI like to do laps because I feel it sometimes may make the other skaters nervous that I finished early,\u201d Rippon said last month, \u201cand I always smile at all the judges when I go by.\u201d\n\nMa\u00e9-B\u00e9r\u00e9nice M\u00e9it\u00e9, who is competing in her second Olympics for France, said the warm-up settles her mind.\n\n\u201cIf you have some troubles, you\u2019re more aware of what you\u2019re doing,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if you are good, you just have to keep going and be the same in your program.\u201d\n\nSkating etiquette calls for big jumpers to be afforded more space. Everyone is supposed to negotiate traffic on the ice like cars merging onto the highway.

Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan, who successfully defended his men\u2019s singles title last week, collided with Han Yan of China near center ice during warm-ups at the Cup of China several months after his 2014 Olympic victory. Both skaters completed their long programs, although Hanyu skated with his head bandaged and fell five times.\n\nMishaps of that magnitude occur more often at practice sessions, which are an elongated version of the warm-up. Rippon said that during a practice a few years ago, he accidentally head-butted a competitor, who had to withdraw from the competition with a concussion.

Cohen said she was aware of her reputation but added that she never took aim at anyone.\n\n\u201cYou only have six minutes and everyone is aggressive with their space in order to get in everything they need to in order to feel prepared,\u201d Cohen said in an email. \u201cThat can mean having to jump almost on top of someone to avoid having to circle and do it again.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

There are no plans for Ms. Trump to meet with anyone from North Korea during her three-day visit, though an official declined to rule out the possibility.\n\nMs. Trump will travel with the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, and Allison Hooker, a National Security Council official who specializes in Korean affairs, among others.

He arrived with a directive from Mr. Trump to blunt the propaganda campaign of North Korea, which has used the Olympics as a kind of olive branch to the South.\n\nWhile the president authorized Mr. Pence to meet with the North Koreans, he insisted that any meeting be held privately, away from cameras, and that Mr. Pence deliver the same harsh message in private that he delivered in public.\n\nMr. Pence reinforced his hard-line image by remaining seated during the opening ceremony when the audience stood for the unified Korean Olympic team.

And from the look of things, they got wholeheartedly into the spirit of sexy self-presentation and image manipulation central to the culture of Instagram \u2014 a fact as apparently true of those competing in obscure disciplines as the stars of marquee sports.\n\nSure, Lindsey Vonn was early to the demands of a social media era, appearing on the slopes at both the World Cup tour and the Winter Olympics in a full face of fashionable and camera-ready makeup. And Ms. Vonn\u2019s marketing savvy has long proved effective, to judge by her endorsements with Red Bull, Rolex, GoPro, Bounty Paper Towels and others, along with her huge Instagram following.\n\nPhoto\n\nYet, while commercial jackpots may not be in store for someone like the Norwegian ski jumper Robert Johansson (IG: @rbrt_johansson), a 27-year-old ginger with a slicked back-and-undercut Billyburg haircut and curling porn-star mustache, he was a stellar example of an athlete embracing style on a global platform just for fun.\n\nThe same is true, of course, of Mr. Johansson\u2019s countryman Thomas Ulsrud and fellow members of the curling team, whose buff bodies have been turned into a hottie calendar, while the Loudmouth brand trousers they debuted at the Winter Olympics in Vancouver in 2010 \u2014 plaid, polka-dot, floral and checked patterns reminiscent of Crazy Uncle Mort \u2014 have since evolved into one of the wittier continuing fashion statements in sports.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story The Open Thread Fashion Newsletter A look from across The New York Times at the forces that shape the dress codes we share, with Vanessa Friedman as your personal shopper.

Take the slopestyle snowboarder Kyle Mack, a United States team member who, though he failed to land certain tricks in early qualifying runs, competed in bum-baring saggers, giving a nod to the hip-hop styling that underpins a once renegade sport.\n\nPhoto\n\nOr consider the competitors in skeleton, the terrifying event where athletes shoot headfirst down a sinuous ice track on a sled without brakes at speeds exceeding 80 miles an hour. In their skintight superhero bodysuits and face-obscuring helmets, skeleton athletes are difficult to distinguish from one another. So competitors like Joseph Luke Cecchini of Italy customized the helmet, in his case with an airbrushed image of a flaming skull. Katie Uhlaender of the United States chose a bald eagle for her headgear, and Barrett Martineau of Canada a fanged and snarling bear.\n\nUniquely among those competing at the games, ice skaters have latitude to forgo uniforms for costumes and, as anyone who has seen \u201cI, Tonya\u201d knows, the results can range from laughable to deeply sad. At these Winter Games, however, few ice skating costumes have looked like outtakes from a streetwalker\u2019s trousseau.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYes, there has been abundant glitter, plenty of sparkle, volumes of beading, enough chiffon and \u201cnude\u201d-colored illusion effects to tent a parking lot.

No Kirakira+ has been needed at the 2018 Winter Games, where it sometimes seems as if a filter for glinting cartoon starlight has already been applied. That, too, has been part of the fun of this Olympics, the giddy embrace of the theatricality and flamboyance that were formerly disdained or ridiculed.\n\nWhether channeling the \u201cHunger Games\u201d or Violet Chachki, a winner of \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race,\u201d Johnny Weir, a two-time Olympian who has transformed himself into a knowledgeable, articulate sports commentator, has served throughout these games as stealth ambassador for fashion as an emblem of aspiration and also of his individual brand of gender blur.

(Gay Talese revealed in \u201cThe Kingdom and the Power\u201d that he had actually been an army captain, not a colonel, and served in World War I as a trainer of pack animals.) Regardless of his rank, he was fond of barking orders to his underlings, military style.\n\nHe had hired Vinson \u201chesitantly and after considerable soul-searching,\u201d the Times columnist Arthur Daley wrote years later. \u201cHe regretted it the very first day\u201d when he realized that he would not be able to swear as much.\n\nYears later, though, Vinson recalled of her colleagues, \u201cThey soon found out I could outdrink them,\u201d according to one of her skating students, Frank Carroll (who would later coach some of the world\u2019s most renowned skaters).\n\nVinson was not just some celebrity author who swanned in to dash off a few skating articles. She plunged right into the daily grind of a real sportswriter. She amassed 189 bylines in her first 12 months, and covered track, tennis, swimming, lacrosse and horse shows.\n\nUnder the banner \u201cWomen in Sports,\u201d her first column reported on the Curtis Cup matches for amateur golfers and added notes about a fencing exhibition at the Hotel Astor and field hockey in Prospect Park.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven at her young age, her prose reveals that she was a pro, seriously and carefully laying out the news of every event, even if it was low in the sports pecking order. Within the limits of The Times\u2019s strict rules and sometimes stiff house writing style, she managed to impart some flavor to her coverage.\n\nIn reporting on an outdoor swim meet in Manhattan Beach in 1935, she wrote, \u201cIt was not a water hazard but a mental hazard that Miss Rawls had to face in the medley race. For the sprightly, laughing Southerner is literally \u2018frightened to death\u2019 by lightning, and it must have been small comfort to see a telephone pole a block away struck by a bolt and burning merrily away.\u201d\n\nHer bylines almost always appeared over accounts of women\u2019s sports. No one sent Vinson to write about a glamorous event like a bowl game, a prize fight or the World Series (although Carroll says she often attended such events with her male colleagues). Instead, she plied her trade at places like the Heights Casino in Brooklyn for squash, the Pelham Country Club for golf and Jones Beach for archery.\n\nDaley acknowledged that while Vinson was \u201cnever completely accepted\u201d by The Times\u2019s boys\u2019 club, she was eventually \u201cwarily admitted to the gang.\u201d\n\nAmazingly, Vinson juggled full-time sportswriting with full-time athletic pursuits. On Jan. 13, 1936, she reported a squash story from the Cosmopolitan Club in Manhattan. On the 15th, she sailed for Germany and the Winter Olympics on the liner Washington. (It was an era when boat sailings were big news. The Times reported that Sergei Rachmaninoff was also on board; Vinson made the boat by just 10 minutes and forgot her uniform.)\n\nOn Feb. 2, her byline appeared again, over a story about the women\u2019s ski team. On the 13th, she finished fifth in her third Olympics. She also placed fifth in the pairs competition alongside George Hill. On March 3, she was back on the squash beat, reporting from London, and before the month was out she was back reporting on badminton from New York.\n\nVinson wrote her last article for the Times in 1937 (\u201cMiss Amory Victor With Miss Phipps,\u201d on the results of a \u201cScotch foursome\u201d golf match) and began her coaching career.\n\nPhoto\n\nVinson seldom got to show it in her articles about college field hockey, but she was an intellectual powerhouse. Carroll remembers that in the 1950s, \u201cWe drove around a lot to rinks and would discuss the philosophers I was studying at Holy Cross, like Thomas Aquinas. We\u2019d talk about the Latin language, the differences between ecclesiastical Latin and classical Latin. She was one of the most brilliant women I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThey drove so much, Carroll notes, because Vinson was not allowed to teach at her home rink, the Skating Club of Boston. \"She was brutal, and they didn\u2019t like that ... She was a very tough, tough mentor. She demanded discipline.\u201d\n\nVinson kept at writing, penning three books about figure skating and contributing off and on to The Associated Press and Boston Globe.\n\nShe raised two daughters, Maribel and Laurence, and both became elite skaters. (Laurence took after her mother and wrote poetry.) In 1961, mother and daughters, along with 15 other members of the U.S. skating team, died when their 707 jet crashed in Brussels on the way to the world championships in Prague. It was a devastating day for United States skating, and made front page news nationwide.\n\nVinson\u2019s legacy lives on through coaches like Carroll, who trained Michelle Kwan and Evan Lysacek, among others.\n\nAnd through all the women sportswriters who have graced these pages.", "keywords": ["figure", "vinson", "skater", "wrote", "world", "olympic", "women", "reporting", "times", "history", "club", "carroll", "skating", "squash"], "polarity": 0.005648415370637596, "subjectivity": 0.3816097482764149},

At 7, he was a snowboarder. He once broke his thumb when it got stuck in a corrugated pipe in a snowboard park. He played football in high school, too, but eventually went just with snowboarding because the schedules conflicted.\n\nBesides, Laura Corning said, \u201cfootball is dangerous.\u201d\n\nMastering big air is all about starting small and making incremental improvements as a snowboarder, the Cornings said. First you try a half turn, then a full turn. Then eventually you\u2019re hitting 1080s, and more.

Brook Corning said that he had to sign \u201cabout a billion waivers\u201d before they could go and that he had to strap a beacon onto Chris so the boy could be found in an avalanche. They were also given shovels and probes, in case they needed to dig out.\n\n\u201cWhen we were hiking across a knife\u2019s edge and there were cliffs on both sides, I thought, \u2018Hmm, maybe this really isn\u2019t a good idea,\u2019\u201d Brook Corning said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, we had so much fun.

I\u2019ll never tire of their skill \u2014 their consummate speed and control \u2014 but this year, as they swept across the ice with gaping mouths to music from the \u201cMoulin Rouge\u201d soundtrack, they ran my red light.\n\nIt\u2019s true that skating isn\u2019t pure dance. It is, though, extraordinary in its own right and can possess the quiet sophistication, musicality and nuance of dance. With Ms. Papadakis and Mr. Cizeron, skating has room to grow. They aren\u2019t merely ice dancers: They dance on the ice, showing how it\u2019s capable of becoming a living canvas, one that curves toward the skater as the skater curves back into it.\n\nIn ice dance, there are no lifts above the head, no heroic jumps. Its power is rooted in a blade\u2019s deep etchings, the angle of plush knee bends and, despite those awkward boots, toes that point and extend the length of a leg to create fluent line. Arms lengthen from the back with fingers that grow along with them. If, in pairs and singles skating, it seems like the air is increasingly being sucked out of routines to make room for more jumps \u2014 it\u2019s worse when they\u2019re crammed into the second half in order to score more points \u2014 ice dance pushes skating to a more poetic place.\n\nPhoto\n\nHow can skaters bring emotion to a blade? How does their musicality play into a seemingly simple essence of motion? A skater moves forward and backward on the inside or outside edge of a blade. In ice dance, this is not rushed but emphasized in strokes that lean and bend to propel a skater from one side of the rink to the other.\n\nIn the singles and pairs world, pristine edges can be forsaken for jumps and lifts, but one skater who pays attention to the details in between is the American Adam Rippon. He has become a media sensation for his outspokenness, but what I love most about him is his skating. He moves like silk. He cares about line; his spins have an endearing lightness, as the arch of his back in his layback \u2014 arguably the most beautiful spin in skating \u2014 attests.\n\nHe skates for himself, the same way Ms. Papadakis and Mr. Cizeron skate \u2014 as if they are in their own world. When I watch them, my mind goes to a Jerome Robbins quote about \u201cDances at a Gathering,\u201d his sublime 1969 ensemble ballet. \u201cYou should never dance anything for the audience,\u201d he said. \u201cIt ruins it if you do. You should dance only to each other. As if the audience weren\u2019t there. It\u2019s very hard.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

But in their free skate program, set to Beethoven\u2019s \u201cMoonlight\u201d Sonata, Ms. Papadakis and Mr. Cizeron expanded the idea of virtuosity with the way they completely tuned in to each other. Often in ice dancing, you keep your eye on the woman; the man, as in the case of Mr. Moir, is there, in part, to show off the woman \u2014 to spark her fire.\n\nBut the lyrical and musical Ms. Papadakis and Mr. Cizeron are more of a slow boil. Moving as one, they are gossamer as they transform the ice into air. Their free dance unfurled gradually and hypnotically, building to feverish spin sequences. One, in which Mr. Cizeron rotated in a sit spin while holding Ms. Papadakis\u2019s extended leg as she opened her right shoulder and head to the ceiling, was a spectacle of position and daring.\n\nAs soon as the piano became subdued and dreamy, their flurry of footwork returned to the quiet hush of the start. As they glided across the ice in whispering strokes, it seemed as if they were no longer skating in an arena, but on a pond. In that moment, at once bracing and luminous, the Olympics turned from being a competition into a performance.

By the third interval, Goggia was fifth fastest in the field.\n\nAs it turned out, she was just finding her rhythm. By smoothly linking her turns and occasionally taking a more rounded approach to the gates, Goggia kept the flat bases of her skis on the snow surface for longer stretches.

So while other athletes qualified ahead of Swaney, she was able to ski for Hungary thanks to that quota system and a dearth of other athletes from countries that had not already sent four competitors to the event.\n\nPhilippe Belanger, the head judge of freeskiing competitions at the Pyeongchang Olympics, told The Denver Post that the International Ski Federation was considering proposals that would decrease the number of competitive slots available for Olympic competitors in the halfpipe, which would make it more difficult for athletes like Swaney to qualify.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Swaney, who is based in the Bay Area, has been working toward her Olympic dream for most of her life. Inspired by Kristi Yamaguchi\u2019s gold medal performance in the 1992 Olympic Games, Swaney skated from her childhood until her second year of college. (Her father signed her up for a 30-minute weekly lesson. She did not realize until years later that figure skaters trained six or seven days a week.)\n\nFor two years at the University of California, Berkeley, she was the coxswain \u2014 the person who directs the crew from the stern of the boat \u2014 for the nationally competitive men\u2019s rowing team.\n\nHer experience steering a crew team led her to believe that she might be able to steer a bobsled. The United States women\u2019s bobsled team told her that she was too small to be a bobsledder, but that it was impressed by her athletic background. She eventually took up skeleton \u2014 a headfirst version of luge.\n\nShe began skiing in 2010, after attending the Vancouver Olympics and feeling inspired by the skiers, and doubled down on the event after giving up skeleton. For six years, training in Utah, she would often wake up at 6:30 a.m. to go the gym, then ski for hours. She fit in training around two part-time jobs.\n\nStill, she did not know that she would be heading to South Korea until Jan. 24, when she learned she had qualified. She arrived in Budapest at midnight on the 25th, having brought only her passport, her jacket and the bag she had brought to work that day.\n\nShe said there was some attention she was grateful for: the supportive texts she received from her parents after the event.\n\n\u201cMy dad told me he found my runs really graceful, so I was happy to hear that,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not as familiar with skiing as they are with other sports, but they were happy to see me compete.\u201d", "keywords": ["athletes", "olympic", "heart", "halfpipe", "skier", "york", "womens", "told", "swaney", "elizabeth", "competitors", "viral", "ski", "skiers"], "polarity": 0.16708548903670856, "subjectivity": 0.4607521205082182},

Krushelnytsky passed a drug test on Jan. 22 and several others before that, the Russian officials said. Meldonium, which in 2016 led to a long ban for the tennis star Maria Sharapova, usually stays in the system for months.\n\n\u201cWe express our sincere regret over the fact of the incident,\u201d the Russian officials said in their statement. \u201cAt the same time, the circumstances of the case do not provide any answers to the questions as to how and when meldonium could have gotten into the athlete\u2019s body.\u201d\n\nKrushelnytsky had been at a training camp in Japan before the Games.

Before his programs last week, the American Adam Rippon spent the last minute circling the ice as if he were a short-track skater.\n\n\u201cI like to do laps because I feel it sometimes may make the other skaters nervous that I finished early,\u201d Rippon said last month, \u201cand I always smile at all the judges when I go by.\u201d\n\nMa\u00e9-B\u00e9r\u00e9nice M\u00e9it\u00e9, who is competing in her second Olympics for France, said the warm-up settles her mind.\n\n\u201cIf you have some troubles, you\u2019re more aware of what you\u2019re doing,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if you are good, you just have to keep going and be the same in your program.\u201d\n\nSkating etiquette calls for big jumpers to be afforded more space. Everyone is supposed to negotiate traffic on the ice like cars merging onto the highway.

Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan, who successfully defended his men\u2019s singles title last week, collided with Han Yan of China near center ice during warm-ups at the Cup of China several months after his 2014 Olympic victory. Both skaters completed their long programs, although Hanyu skated with his head bandaged and fell five times.\n\nMishaps of that magnitude occur more often at practice sessions, which are an elongated version of the warm-up. Rippon said that during a practice a few years ago, he accidentally head-butted a competitor, who had to withdraw from the competition with a concussion.

Cohen said she was aware of her reputation but added that she never took aim at anyone.\n\n\u201cYou only have six minutes and everyone is aggressive with their space in order to get in everything they need to in order to feel prepared,\u201d Cohen said in an email. \u201cThat can mean having to jump almost on top of someone to avoid having to circle and do it again.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
