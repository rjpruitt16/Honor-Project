He expressed grief for those who were affected by the shooting at Stoneman Douglas, in Parkland, Fla., but he said that people in the United States needed to find ways to disagree \u201cwithout accusing one another of being evil people.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBut the audience, and Mr. Guttenberg, did not hold back in criticizing Mr. Rubio\u2019s position on gun control. Mr. Guttenberg repeatedly asked whether Mr. Rubio believed that \u201cguns were the factor in the hunting of our kids.\u201d\n\nThe senator said he agreed, but he insisted that other types of laws would better prevent such attacks in the future. He said that he would support a bill to increase the minimum age for the purchase of an assault weapon to 21 from 18. And he said that he backed improvements to background checks and a ban on bump stocks, which can convert semiautomatic weapons to fire automatically.\n\nStudents and teachers at the event also had questions for Florida\u2019s other politicians, including two Democrats, Senator Bill Nelson and Representative Ted Deutch.\n\nPhoto\n\nOne young student talked about how her best friend was gunned down in front of her, and she asked Mr. Nelson about background checks, and how to improve them.\n\nAnother student, whose brother was killed in the shooting, bluntly said to Mr. Deutch that \u201cmy friends and I are worried that we are going to be murdered in our classrooms.\u201d He asked what Mr. Deutch was going to do about it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAs a starter,\u201d the congressman said, \u201cI\u2019m going to introduce legislation to make sure that assault weapons are illegal in every part of this country.\u201d\n\nThe audience burst out in applause.\n\nBut Mr. Rubio, who ran for president in 2016, was the primary target of ire from people at the forum, who repeatedly challenged the senator\u2019s positions on gun control and his willingness to accept donations from the National Rifle Association.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

When Mr. Rubio refused, the audience booed loudly.\n\n\u201cPeople buy into my agenda and I do support the Second Amendment,\u201d Mr. Rubio said, repeatedly refusing to say he would stop accepting money from the group. \u201cThe influence of these groups comes not from money, the influence comes from the millions of people who support the agenda.\u201d\n\nMr. Deutch at one point engaged in a brief debate with Mr. Rubio, saying that a gun that allowed the shooter to fire off 150 rounds in six to seven minutes \u201cshould be banned.\u201d\n\nLater, Chris Grady, a student at the high school, thanked Mr. Rubio for appearing at the forum, unlike President Trump and Rick Scott, the Republican governor of Florida, who both turned down invitations from CNN to participate.\n\n\u201cA lot more than can be said for our so-called president and governor,\u201d Mr. Grady told Mr. Rubio. \u201cWe need you and your colleagues on both sides to come together with us and find a compromise if we are ever to solve this epidemic that is plaguing our country.\u201d\n\nMr. Grady asked the senator whether he supported legislation to limit high-capacity magazines that allow weapons to fire many bullets quickly. Mr. Rubio said that he had long opposed such legislation, but was now reconsidering that position.\n\nMr. Rubio said that there would be evidence from the Florida school shooting that suggested the shooter might have killed fewer people if he did not have high capacity magazines.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have prevented the attack but it would have made it less lethal,\u201d the senator said.", "keywords": ["rubio", "school", "father", "shooting", "florida", "asked", "gun", "weapons", "control", "mr", "victim", "senator", "student", "support", "confronts"], "polarity": 0.05091876557785649, "subjectivity": 0.3517163518299882},

Speaks First and Loudest                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/us/politics/nratv-nra-news-media-operation.html", "text": "Where the N.R.A. Speaks First and Loudest NRATV, the organization\u2019s online video channel, has become a little-noticed but vital forum for the dissemination of some of the most strident pro-gun messaging in politics.\n\nVideo The National Rifle Association\u2019s online video channel has a wide range of programming \u2014 and that\u2019s the point.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Whenever there is a mass shooting, the National Rifle Association has a well-rehearsed response: Say very little until the inevitable discussion about gun control cools down.\n\nBut as the leaders of the country\u2019s most influential gun advocacy group kept quiet after the school shooting last week in Parkland, Fla., that claimed 17 lives, a furious debate played out on NRATV, the organization\u2019s online video channel.\n\nIts hosts spoke chillingly of leftist plots to confiscate weapons, media conspiracies to brainwash Americans into supporting gun control and a \u201cdeep state\u201d campaign to undermine President Trump.\n\n\u201cCoastal, socialist media elites hate guns so much,\u201d said one of the hosts, Grant Stinchfield, a Second Amendment activist based in Dallas and a radio commentator, that they would take everyone\u2019s away, \u201cleaving only criminals, of course, with the firepower \u2014 and all of us at the mercy of evil.\u201d\n\nCritics of the N.R.A. say that they have observed a shift in the organization\u2019s tone since Mr. Trump was elected that is much more pugilistic, and that NRATV is where the most outrageous commentary occurs. This change, they say, seems to reflect the fact that like many organizations on the right, the N.R.A. believes it has to guard against complacency among its members with a friendly president in the White House.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no boogeyman in the White House now to make people afraid of,\u201d said Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, a gun control advocacy group. \u201cSo they have to make us afraid of one another, and that is how they will market guns in an age when they have a president beholden to them.\u201d\n\nThe channel has become a little-noticed but vital forum for the dissemination of some of the most strident pro-gun messaging in politics today, with hosts and guests who are closely allied with Mr. Trump. Few news media operations seem as in sync with the political sensibilities of the Trump era.\n\nThey attack the enemies he attacks, condemning the news media as \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201cfailing.\u201d They have questioned the credibility of the F.BI., whose failure to act on tips about the suspect in the Florida shooting has intensified criticism from conservatives seeking to discredit the bureau \u2014 this week, Dana Loesch, an N.R.A. spokeswoman, encouraged mass demonstrations outside F.B.I. offices.\n\n\"I hope that people are marching to the FBI Offices. This is a question that I've not seen #MSM cover: why is it that this individual was reported over 30 times\u2026why is it that none of these questions are being brought up?\"\n\n\u2013@DLoesch #NRA pic.twitter.com/24BNQvVN9H \u2014 NRATV (@NRATV) February 19, 2018\n\nAnd they often side with Mr. Trump in divisive cultural disputes \u2014 some of which have potent racial undercurrents \u2014 like his feuding with Black Lives Matter activists and the professional football players who knelt during the national anthem.\n\nWith broadcast television-quality production and three dozen original series, NRATV has the ability to reach millions of people through the channels that distribute it like Apple TV, Roku and Amazon Fire TV. And it has significant resources at its disposal as part of the N.R.A.\u2019s far-reaching \u201cmembership support\u201d program. In recent years, that operation alone spent $35.5 million, according to its most recent publicly available tax filing.\n\nBut it is just the newest piece of a larger news media operation inside the N.R.A. that receives little attention compared with the group\u2019s political and lobbying activity. The organization produces at least seven print and online magazines that have a combined circulation of more than 11 million, according to the N.R.A. Its biggest social media channels on Facebook and Twitter count about 8.7 million followers. On YouTube, five N.R.A.-controlled channels have shared videos that have received nearly 102 million views.\n\nAndrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the N.R.A., declined to discuss the media effort, the size of its online audience or its programming in the wake of the Parkland shooting. As a matter of policy, he said, the N.R.A. does not discuss proprietary matters.\n\nNRATV is a budding business for the organization, which has brokered sponsorship arrangements with gun makers like Kimber, Mossberg and Ruger to feature their firearms on its programs. Its series cover a range of topics and interests intended to appeal to gun owners of all kinds, like \u201cArmed and Fabulous,\u201d which profiles rifle-slinging women; \u201cFrontlines,\u201d a newsmagazine hosted by Oliver North; and \u201cUnder Wild Skies,\u201d which follows hunters in pursuit of big-game trophies.\n\nBut politics and provocation are NRATV\u2019s specialty. It has singled out news outlets and attacked individual journalists like Don Lemon of CNN, who was targeted in an ad that accused the anchor and his network of smearing Mr. Trump and colluding with Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. In one video released this month, Ms. Loesch, a former Tea Party activist and Breitbart editor, pretended she was about to burn a copy of The New York Times.\n\nStories that circulate throughout right-wing news media often find their way to NRATV, which has devoted numerous segments to portraying anti-Trump demonstrators as paid shills, violent extremists and evangelists for Shariah law in the United States.\n\nIts guests and hosts are not shy of trading in racially charged language and imagery. A promo for a program called \u201cNoir\u201d featuring a Navy SEAL member named Dom Raso opens with a dramatization of a foiled robbery. A black man wielding a knife grabs and forces a white woman to the ground as an armed bystander reaches for his handgun and rushes to her defense.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration last year, an NRATV correspondent, Chuck Holton, tweeted that it was time to \u201cget busy scrubbing Obama\u2019s mocacchino stain off of America!\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to the color of President Barack Obama\u2019s skin.\n\nOkay! Party's over. Let's get busy scrubbing Obama's mocacchino stain off of America! \u2014 Chuck Holton (@rangerholton) January 22, 2017\n\nThe N.R.A.\u2019s practice is to keep a low profile after mass shootings, as it did after the massacres in Newtown, Conn., and at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. But it was always quietly talking to its members, first by email and later on NRATV, said Danny Barefoot, a partner at Anvil Strategies, an ad agency and communications company that has worked with gun control groups.\n\n\u201cIn those moments, the goal isn\u2019t to disseminate mass information and persuade a lot of people, \u201d Mr. Barefoot said. \u201cThe strategy is to be a messenger to the N.R.A.\u2019s own people.\u201d\n\nEli Pariser, the co-founder of Upworthy, a site that delivered progressive political videos to targeted audiences on Facebook, said that while videos produced by NRATV after a shooting might not go viral, they helped viewers \u201cfeel they\u2019re part of a community, led by a news source that speaks to them.\u201d\n\nNRATV can galvanize members in the wake of a shooting in part because the N.R.A. has coached its followers to believe that the organization is the only credible source for news and information on any gun issue or controversy.\n\nNRATV\u2019s slogan \u2014 \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Patriotic Team on a Mission to Take Back The Truth\u201d \u2014 reinforces a sense of mistrust in traditional news media, as do its hosts. In the days after the Parkland shooting, Mr. Stinchfield and Ms. Loesch, two of the channel\u2019s most prominent faces, were relentless in their attacks on the news media.\n\nImage Technicians at NRATV preparing the broadcast set on Wednesday at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland. Credit Pete Marovich for The New York Times\n\n\u201cIf it can topple us, it gets a direct path to the Second Amendment,\u201d Mr. Stinchfield told viewers this week from the organization\u2019s studio in Dallas. \u201cThey will stop at nothing to put us out of business.\u201d\n\nSome of his more recent antics have included taking a sledgehammer to a television set as clips from MSNBC, CNN and ABC play onscreen, and inviting North Korea to launch a nuclear weapon on Sacramento, where the California state legislature has approved numerous gun control measures opposed by the N.R.A.\n\nMr. Stinchfield went on to question the competence and motivation of the F.B.I. \u201cIt is time the F.B.I. got back to the business of keeping Americans safe, instead of being so focused on political vendettas,\u201d he said. He then turned the microphone over to Mr. Holton, who saw a slippery slope in new gun regulations and identified a new culprit in the proliferation of school shootings: the news media.\n\n\u201cPeople could just as easily call for restrictions on the first amendment,\u201d Mr. Holton said. \u201cThey could say, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s make it illegal to report on those school shootings because we all know, I mean, there\u2019s no doubt that the media circus that takes place every time one of these things happens causes more school shootings.\u201d\n\nJeremy W.

He raised a particular concern over conflicting statements from Mr. Pruitt\u2019s press office about whether the administrator had a waiver to fly first class at all times.\n\nImage Representative Trey Gowdy has asked that Mr. Pruitt\u2019s travel information be handed over by March 6. Credit Al Drago for The New York Times\n\n\u201cClearly, federal regulations prohibit a blanket waiver to fly first class except to accommodate disabilities or special needs,\u201d Mr. Gowdy wrote in a letter. \u201cInstead, a waiver is required for each flight in order to fly first or business class when traveling on official government business.\u201d\n\nMr. Pruitt has been under fire for his travel since The Washington Post reported that he routinely flies first or business class, and that he and top aides had spent more than $90,000 on airfare in the first few weeks of June alone.\n\nJahan Wilcox, a spokesman for the E.P.A., initially issued a statement that said that Mr. Pruitt had a \u201cblanket waiver\u201d to fly first class out of concern for his security. Mr. Wilcox later amended that to say that the E.P.A. did in fact submit a waiver for each trip.\n\nAccording to the General Services Administration\u2019s regulations for travel by federal employees, \u201cblanket authorization\u201d of anything other than coach-fare travel is barred except for reasons related to a disability or special need, and authorization for first-class travel is given on a \u201ctrip-by-trip\u201d basis.\n\nMr. Pruitt has long been a target of criticism from Democrats, who last week asked the E.P.A.\u2019s inspector general to expand an existing investigation into the administrator\u2019s trips. But the issue of first-class travel has also struck a nerve with a handful of Republicans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised at the expense of it,\u201d Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia said in an interview last week. \u201cGood stewardship of the federal dollar is important to me, and it should be to him.\u201d\n\nMr. Gowdy asked that Mr. Pruitt\u2019s travel information be handed over by 5 p.m. on March 6.

He also expressed a willingness to challenge the legal foundation of federal climate-change policy, the 2009 Environmental Protection Agency decision known as the \u201cendangerment finding,\u201d which declares that greenhouse gases are harmful to human health and must be regulated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to say \u2018no,\u2019\u201d Mr. van der Vaart said when asked if he would support repealing the endangerment finding.\n\nSome activists who deny established climate-change science, like Myron Ebell at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank, support Mr. van der Vaart\u2019s potential nomination, saying he combines more than 25 years of regulatory experience with a unique background as both a lawyer and chemical engineer. In addition, Mr. Ebell said, Mr. van der Vaart\u2019s climate views are closely aligned with those of the previous nominee, Kathleen Hartnett White, who was withdrawn from consideration this month.\n\n\u201cHaving lost Kathleen, which saddens me, I think Donald van der Vaart is a good alternative. He brings many of the same strengths,\u201d Mr. Ebell said. And, he noted, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a long and open trail of speeches and comments,\u201d like Ms. White does, in which opponents can look for ammunition.\n\nMs. White, a former chairwoman of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, came under fire from both parties for her environmental views. Democrats attacked her for suggesting that smog is not harmful and for calling carbon dioxide the \u201cgas of life.\u201d (Carbon dioxide is a major contributor to climate change.) She also said that an E.P.A. standard that requires increasing the amount of ethanol in the nation\u2019s fuel supply should be repealed, angering Midwestern Republicans.\n\nSenator Tom Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said he found Ms. White\u2019s views so unsettling that he mounted a campaign to block her confirmation. Mr. Carper said he visited the offices of 16 Republican senators to voice his concerns, bringing with him an iPad in order to play a three-minute video that his staff had compiled of Ms. White struggling to respond to questions posed by both Republicans and Democrats at her hearing.\n\nIn an interview last week, Mr. Carper said he believed his effort had played a part in ending Ms. White\u2019s nomination. Several lawmakers, including Susan Collins of Maine and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, acknowledged through their press officers meeting with Mr. Carper but declined to comment on whether the effort swayed them.\n\nJohn Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming and the chairman of the Senate environment panel, said in a statement that withdrawing Ms. White\u2019s nomination from consideration \u201cwas her decision.\u201d\n\nMs. White declined to discuss either her appearance before the committee or Mr. Carper\u2019s video compilation. The Texas Public Policy Foundation, where Ms. White works as a senior fellow, also declined to comment, as did the White House.\n\nThe administration did not respond to a separate request to discuss the candidates now under consideration to lead the Council on Environmental Quality. The short list also includes Mary Neumayr, who as the agency\u2019s chief of staff since March has been doing the job in an acting capacity for nearly a year, said Jeffrey Holmstead, a partner at the firm Bracewell and a former E.P.A. air chief.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been a steady hand at C.E.Q. since she got there and everyone thinks she\u2019s been doing a great job,\u201d Mr. Holmstead said. But, he added, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that she wants the attention that comes with being the chair and having to run the gantlet of the confirmation process.\u201d\n\nCalls to the Council on Environmental Quality were not returned.\n\nMs. Neumayr\u2019s views on topics like climate change are far less well known than Mr. van der Vaart\u2019s.\n\nMr. van der Vaart said last week that while he believes human emissions contribute to climate change, \u201cthe accuracy of the modeling is such that on the one hand I\u2019m not sure we know what the fraction of man-made climate change is.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so important to know what that fraction is for us to develop a solution,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s no good spending a lot of money when it turns out that\u2019s not going to help you. All I\u2019m saying is, yes, we contribute. But I\u2019m not prepared to say it\u2019s the only factor.\u201d\n\nLate last year, 13 federal agencies found with high confidence that more than 92 percent of the observed rise in global average temperatures since 1950 is the direct result of human activity.\n\nMr. van der Vaart also offered support for another area that has invited criticism: the \u201cred team-blue team\u201d debates to critique climate science that Scott Pruitt, administrator of the E.P.A., told Congress recently he still intends to hold.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a great idea to debate issues,\u201d Mr. van der Vaart said. \u201cThe question is, how do you actually do it? Do you have one debate? Do you have 10 debates? It\u2019s a very attractive notion, but I\u2019d like to think and talk to a lot of people about how to best implement that.\u201d\n\nLisa Friedman reports on climate and environmental policy in Washington.

Credit Brandon Dill for The New York Times\n\nThe State of Mississippi on Wednesday awarded a tax break worth up to $6 million for a hotel project involving the Trump family business, a public subsidy that could indirectly benefit President Trump.\n\nThe board of the Mississippi Development Authority approved the so-called tourism tax rebate, which had been requested by the development\u2019s local owners, Dinesh and Suresh Chawla. The Trump Organization will brand and manage the hotel and collect fees from the Chawlas for doing so.\n\nThe subsidy, to be paid out over a period of many years, is expected to offset nearly a third of the Chawlas\u2019 projected $20 million in costs for building the hotel, which is scheduled to open this fall in Cleveland, Miss. The property, called Scion West End, is to be the first in a new line of four-star Scion hotels that the Trump Organization announced late in the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThe state\u2019s approval of the tax rebate is the culmination of more than two years of efforts by the Chawlas that predate their partnership with the Trumps, according to emails obtained by The New York Times through a public records request. After the Chawlas announced plans last June to team up with the Trumps, Suresh Chawla alerted an array of personal contacts and state and local officials, including an aide to Mississippi\u2019s governor, Phil Bryant, in emails with the subject line \u201cTrump Hotels Coming to the Mississippi Delta.\u201d\n\nIn December, the Chawlas formally applied for the tax rebate from the state development agency, which is led by Glenn McCullough Jr., an appointee of Mr. Bryant, both of whom are supportive of President Trump.\n\nIn an email on Wednesday, Dinesh Chawla said he and his brother were pleased by the approval, though they said the development agency had not notified them of it.\n\nThe development agency declined to comment.\n\nThe decision to approve the request was not unusual for the agency, which evaluates applications for the tourism rebate program based on set criteria and has granted similar subsidies to other hotels.\n\nThe award renews legal questions about a Trump-affiliated property receiving benefits from a state or local government. Ethics watchdogs and the president\u2019s critics say the Mississippi tax break would benefit the president, albeit indirectly, because he continues to own the Trump Organization through a trust.\n\nSuch benefits, they say, could violate the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clauses, which essentially prohibit the president from accepting certain gifts from foreign or domestic governments. Other legal experts, however, contend that domestic emoluments are allowable so long as Mr. Trump does not earn them from his service as president.\n\nDinesh Chawla said in an email to The Times earlier this month that the Trump Organization had played no role in the rebate application and that the Trumps and the Chawlas had agreed that any rebate would not figure into fees paid to the Trumps.\n\nMr. Chawla said he and his brother had sought the rebate to \u201cimprove our cash flow.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the Mississippi development agency said the Trump name was not mentioned anywhere in the Chawlas\u2019 application.\n\nThe development agency\u2019s tourism rebate program is part of an effort to draw tourists to Mississippi and help the local economy. According to the development agency, the program allows a developer to recoup some of the sales taxes collected on a property to \u201creimburse the applicant for eligible costs incurred during the project\u2019s construction.\u201d The agency said earlier this month that 23 other tourism rebate applications had been approved under the program, including 10 for hotels.\n\nThe partnership between the Chawlas and the Trumps materialized after Mr. Bryant, a Republican, introduced members of the two families during the 2016 presidential campaign. The governor and the Chawlas have known each other for years.\n\nClay Chandler, a spokesman for Mr. Bryant, said earlier this month that the Chawlas had followed the same procedure as other applicants for the tax rebate. \u201cState law guides the application process, and state law alone will determine if any application is approved,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his earlier email to The Times, Dinesh Chawla said that \u201cno contact with Governor Bryant or his executive staff has been made regarding the project, other than our general discussion about what the project contains.\u201d\n\nStill, the Chawlas contacted state officials for more than two years, seeking to get the project on their radar, according to the emails obtained through a public records request.\n\n\u201cI would really appreciate your efforts in advocating this idea with the Governor\u2019s office, MDA executive director Glenn McCullough, and MDA staff and others,\u201d Suresh Chawla wrote in a July 2015 email to Robert Morgan, an aide to Mr. Bryant, using the acronym for the development agency.\n\n\u201cWe did not ask for any favors, other than an honest referral,\u201d Dinesh Chawla said in his email to The Times on Wednesday. \u201cWe wanted to introduce it to the state hierarchy, because in our state, a $20 million project is of significant note.\u201d\n\nLast summer, Suresh Chawla alerted Mr. Morgan to the partnership with the Trumps within minutes of its being announced, sending him and other officials a news release about the deal.\n\nWhen Mr. Morgan received the message, he shared the news release with three other members of Mr. Bryant\u2019s administration, including his chief of staff, along with an official at the development agency.\n\nDinesh Chawla said that he and his brother had emailed more than 1,000 people with the news of the deal. \u201cIt had nothing to do with the people in high offices,\u201d he said.\n\nEllen Ann Fentress contributed reporting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe All-New DealBook Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/upshot/gerrymandering-pennsylvania-democrats-republicans-court.html", "text": "Advertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats Didn\u2019t Even Dream of This Pennsylvania Map. How Did It Happen? They seemed not to believe that they would be allowed to strive for partisan balance in addressing Republican gerrymandering.\n\nFew people expected that the Pennsylvania congressional map, which the state Supreme Court ordered redrawn to undo Republican gerrymandering, would prove to be as favorable to Democrats as the one adopted by the court on Monday.\n\nPerhaps the easiest way to convey the cause for surprise: The new map is better for Democrats \u2014 by nearly every measure \u2014 than the maps that Democrats themselves proposed.\n\nHow could that be?\n\nIt is hard to explain. Perhaps all four Democratic map proposals reflected an earnest effort to reach a compromise with Republicans. The more likely explanation is that Democrats did not believe it was realistic to demand such a favorable map, since it would require a series of Democratic-leaning choices. And the court order did not specify that the maps should aim for partisan balance, which might have justified a more Democratic map.\n\nApparently, a more favorable map was quite realistic; after all, it is now a reality, one that gives a significant boost to Democratic hopes of retaking the House. It\u2019s a reality because the newly adopted map consistently makes subtle choices that nudge districts in the direction of Democrats.\n\nMany of those choices are easy to spot on a map. Every potentially competitive Republican-held district juts out to add Democratic areas, like adding York to the 10th District, Lansdale to the First District, Reading to the Sixth District, Stroudsburg to the Seventh District, South Philadelphia to the Fifth District, or Mount Lebanon and Penn Hills to the 17th.\n\nThere are also subtle choices that are harder to see. They\u2019re less about picking and choosing municipalities and more about how to group counties. These choices also often work to the advantage of Democrats, like the decision to center the 12th District in Beaver rather than in Butler County, or to have the Fifth District, rather than the Fourth or the First, take population in Philadelphia.\n\nAny of these decisions can be justified. It is also possible, although unlikely and unproven, that only this combination of choices yields the absolute minimum number of split counties or municipalities, the key criterion of the court order.\n\nBut in all of these cases, there were Republican-leaning alternatives of seemingly comparable merit. Collectively, it\u2019s a pattern of augmenting Democratic strength, inching the statewide map closer to partisan parity.\n\nThis does not necessarily mean the map amounts to a \u201cDemocratic gerrymander,\u201d as some have suggested. Over all, it admirably adheres to traditional nonpartisan redistricting criteria, like compactness and the avoidance of unnecessary county splits. But the map makes Democratic-tilting choices so consistently that it is hard not to wonder whether it was part of an intentional effort to achieve partisan balance in a state that is fairly evenly divided.\n\nIt would be somewhat surprising, at least to me, if the court drew this map without that goal in mind. Nathaniel Persily, the Stanford professor who helped draw the map, has been barred by the court from discussing it.\n\nA series of pro-Democratic choices would be necessary to create statewide partisan balance, since lopsided winning margins in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh put Democrats at a considerable disadvantage in translating their votes to seats statewide. In fact, the new map still slightly advantages the Republicans with respect to the statewide popular vote.\n\nPerhaps it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise if the court strove for partisan symmetry in the context of a partisan gerrymandering case. But the court order did not say that the maps should strive for partisan balance, and it seems that\u2019s the reason Democrats did not strive for it, either.\n\nMichael McDonald, an associate professor at the University of Florida, suggests Democrats held back from greater ambition in part because they were protecting incumbents. But there was only one plausibly vulnerable Democratic incumbent to protect, Matt Cartwright, and there is little reason to believe the effort to protect him weakened the Democratic proposals.\n\nMr. Cartwright\u2019s new district voted for President Trump by 10 points; in the Democratic proposals, the district voted for Mr. Trump by an average of nine points. Just as important, even a concerted effort to protect him would have little effect on the overall statewide map. It would be enough to flip the old 15th District from Mr. Trump to Hillary Clinton (going by 2016 results) but no more. And it wouldn\u2019t flip the 15th District in the other contests where Democrats generally fared better, like the 2012 presidential election.\n\nThe map comes close to maximizing the number of Democratic opportunities while complying with the court\u2019s order to minimize county, municipality or precinct splits except to make sure each district has about the same number of people. Perhaps the only plausible way to substantially improve Democratic chances from here would be to split the city of Pittsburgh, an unlikely choice given the requirement to avoid unnecessarily splitting municipalities.\n\nOver all, it\u2019s a huge lift to Democrats\u2019 chances. In this political environment, they\u2019d probably be favored to gain around four seats in the state, up from the two they were favored to carry before. They are overwhelming favorites to win the new versions of the old Seventh and modest favorites to win the old Sixth and 15th, with very good additional opportunities in the old Eighth and 12th, and two long-shot options in the old Third and Fourth.\n\nAlone, the approximately two-seat shift toward the Democrats improves the party\u2019s chance of reclaiming the House by around 5 percent, and even more if the race remains so competitive heading into Election Day. It further diminishes the already deteriorating Republican structural advantages \u2014 including incumbency and geography \u2014 that have long been the key to G.O.P. hopes of surviving a so-called wave election in the House.\n\nAt the beginning of the cycle, it was hard to identify more than a dozen national races where Democrats would have a 50-50 or better chance to win in a wave election. After this decision \u2014 and months of strong Democratic recruitment and a wave of Republican retirements \u2014 it\u2019s a lot easier to come up with the two dozen seats they need to flip the House. Depending on how recruitment shakes out, five of the party\u2019s best 24 opportunities might now be in Pennsylvania.\n\nNate Cohn is a domestic correspondent for The Upshot.

The government reported an unexpected increase in wages, and investors worried the Fed would respond by raising rates a little more quickly. Then Congress passed a plan increasing government spending, tossing more logs onto the fire.\n\nSo far, however, Fed officials have treated the stronger economic news as a reason to carry out their plans for gradual rate hikes, rather than as a reason to start raising rates more quickly. Most Fed officials predicted in December the Fed would raise rates three times in 2018, as it did last year.\n\n\u201cIf the economy evolves as I anticipate, I believe further increases in interest rates will be appropriate this year and next year, at a pace similar to last year\u2019s,\u201d Loretta Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said this month.\n\nIn the policy statement the Fed issued after the January meeting, the central bank outlined its approach to raising rates, saying it \u201cexpects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate.\u201d\n\nThe meeting account said the addition of the word \u201cfurther\u201d in that statement reflected the increased confidence among officials that the Fed would continue raising rates.\n\nPhoto\n\nJesse Edgerton, an economist at JPMorgan Chase, said the Fed\u2019s increased confidence was likely to translate eventually into more interest rate increases than the three Fed officials predicted.\n\n\u201cWe think increased confidence in the need for further hikes will accompany a perceived need for more than three hikes among a growing portion of the committee,\u201d he wrote Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd the minutes did suggest the Fed might eventually raise rates to a level higher than financial markets presently anticipate. Fed officials predicted in December that the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate would come to rest around 2.8 percent, well below its precrisis level. The rate is currently in a range between 1.25 percent and 1.5 percent.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The Fed would welcome such a development, because it would preserve more room to reduce rates in future downturns.\n\nThe persistent question mark is inflation. The Fed aims to keep prices rising at an annual rate of 2 percent, but it has consistently fallen short of that goal since the end of the last recession in 2009.\n\nThe minutes said the Fed has gained some confidence in its prediction that inflation will rise toward 2 percent. The economy continues to gain strength, and the minutes said a decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar was also likely to put upward pressure on inflation. Lower exchange rates translate into higher prices for imported goods.\n\nBut the Fed has made the same predictions repeatedly, without success, and the minutes said the Fed intends to raise rates slowly as it continues to watch inflation closely. Some officials argue that the Fed should stop raising rates until inflation shows clear signs of revival.\n\nThe Fed has good reason for its uncertainty about inflation: It lacks a convincing explanation of what causes inflation, or a model that accurately predicts future inflation.\n\nIn a presentation at the January meeting, economists on the Fed\u2019s staff told policymakers that the most popular explanations had significant flaws. One class of theories says inflation is produced by excess demand for available resources. This suggests inflation should rise as growth approaches its natural speed limit, a pattern that can be seen in some historical data but is difficult to find in recent decades. Another class of theories argues, with some circularity, that inflation is determined by expectations about inflation. It is not clear, however, how those expectations are formed.\n\nThe account said that \u201calmost all\u201d Fed officials responded by expressing a continued commitment to both theories. They said they intended to raise interest rates as the economy gains strength, and to seek to maintain public confidence in the 2 percent inflation target.\n\nThe January meeting was the final meeting for Janet L. Yellen, who concluded her four-year term as the Fed\u2019s chairwoman in early February. Her successor, Jerome H. Powell, is scheduled to make his public debut when he testifies before House and Senate committees next week.", "keywords": ["economy", "feds", "fed", "officials", "inflation", "raise", "raising", "confidence", "say", "meeting", "rate", "higher", "rates", "ready"], "polarity": 0.15447879415270718, "subjectivity": 0.40189158667419533},

Mr. Murphy sued the guards, winning about $307,000 and $108,000 in attorney\u2019s fees.\n\nThe question in the case was how to interpret a federal law that says in such cases \u201ca portion of the judgment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney\u2019s fees awarded against the defendant.\u201d\n\nA trial judge ordered Mr. Murphy to pay 10 percent of his award to his lawyers, but an appeals court ruled that the law required the full 25 percent.\n\nJustice Gorsuch, writing for the majority, said the law left no room for judicial discretion. \u201cWhen you purposefully seek or aim \u2018to satisfy\u2019 an obligation, especially a financial obligation, that usually means you intend to discharge the obligation in full,\u201d he wrote.

By law, officers can go onto private property within 25 miles of the border without permission from the owner.\n\nRicardo D. Palacios, the owner of the Juan Salinas Ranch, said in court filings that Border Patrol officers had been \u201croaming freely about\u201d for years on his property near the small town of Encinal, Tex. He said that the searches were conducted with neither a warrant nor a good reason to be there, and that officers also had stopped his family members at checkpoints.\n\nThe last straw, Mr. Palacios said in court documents, came in November, when he found a surveillance camera hidden in a tree near his house.\n\nMr. Palacios removed the camera and kept it as evidence of federal officers trespassing on his property. Both the Border Patrol and the Texas Department of Public Safety claimed ownership of the camera and have asked Mr. Palacios to return it. State officials have threatened to arrest him on theft charges. Mr. Palacios sued both agencies.\n\nRaul Casso, a lawyer for Mr. Palacios, said the ranch is more than 30 miles from the Rio Grande, which divides the United States and Mexico. He said that put Mr. Palacios\u2019s property beyond the distance that Border Patrol officers can legally patrol without his permission.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey either acted on purpose or incompetently,\u201d said Mr. Casso, a former lawyer for the city of Laredo. \u201cEither way, they are outside the scope of their authority.\u201d Customs and Border Protection officials declined to comment on the case.\n\nIn New Hampshire, the A.C.L.U. is defending 18 people who were arrested at immigration checkpoints on a major interstate where Border Patrol officers stopped hundreds of cars about 90 miles from the Canadian border over the summer. Checkpoints on Interstate 93 were common after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, but had abated by July 2012, Border Patrol officials said.\n\nBorder Patrol officers detained about 33 people on suspicion of immigration-related offenses at checkpoints in northern New Hampshire in August and September; the local police charged an additional 44 with drug possession. In all, the authorities seized about two pounds of marijuana and smaller amounts of cocaine and other drugs, court records show.\n\nGilles Bissonnette, the legal director for New Hampshire\u2019s A.C.L.U. chapter, said the Border Patrol violated state law by conducting the drug searches. He said that New Hampshire courts have held that without a warrant, the authorities cannot deploy drug-sniffing dogs in searches \u2014 as they were at the checkpoints \u2014 without a reasonable suspicion of a crime.\n\n\u201cThey were supposed to be conducting immigration checks,\u201d Mr. Bissonnette said. The checkpoints must be brief and limited to confirming resident status, he said, not primarily used for drug searches or general law enforcement efforts.\n\nNew Hampshire officials maintain that the Border Patrol officers were in their jurisdiction since the checkpoints were under 100 miles from the Canadian border.\n\n\u201cThese are federal agents working for a federal agency performing a federal function within the federation of states,\u201d said Gabriel Nizetic, a lawyer in the state who represented a local police department that participated in the checkpoints.

The Justice Department announced a review of the devices in early December. Led by the A.T.F., the review sought to determine whether the bureau \u2014 which is responsible for policing firearms \u2014 was able to regulate the devices without action from Congress.\n\nUnder the Obama administration, the bureau had determined it could not regulate them.

But policymakers don\u2019t agree on what a leave plan should look like. Now some Republicans have a new idea: Let people collect Social Security benefits early to pay for time off after they have a baby.\n\nUnlike some other proposals, this would require no new taxes. There\u2019s a catch, though: Parents would have their Social Security benefits delayed when they retire to offset the costs.\n\nSocial Security has long been viewed as an untouchable part of the social safety net. By letting people tap it for parental leave, it would begin to feel more like an individual account \u2014 an idea conservatives have been trying to advance for decades.\n\nImage Senator Joni Ernst said she supported the idea because it would provide an option for new mothers who might otherwise leave the work force. Credit Eric Thayer for The New York Times\n\nThe new parental leave plan comes from a right-leaning group called the Independent Women\u2019s Forum, and its president, Carrie Lukas, who said Social Security was based on an antiquated idea of working life. \u201cWomen are a bigger part of the work force now, and they need support at different times of their lives rather than just starting at 67,\u201d she said.\n\nMore broadly, Ms. Lukas has said that she hoped the proposal would \u201cencourage an important mental shift\u201d in the way people think about Social Security. If individuals view it as \u201cproperty,\u201d she reasons, it could lead to the embrace of personal accounts.\n\nThat reasoning is why some experts view the proposal as a backdoor way to try to curb the scale and cost of Social Security. They also said it could put women in a more precarious position in retirement, adding yet another financial penalty to the list that women pay when they become mothers. Women have lower earnings, smaller Social Security benefits and less financial security in retirement because they spend a disproportionate amount of time away from work to raise children, research shows. Drawing down their Social Security benefits early could compound the problem.\n\n\u201cHere you have a situation where women live longer, but they tend to live both sicker and poorer because of the caregiving they do,\u201d said Debra Ness, president of the National Partnership for Women & Families, a nonprofit that champions women\u2019s economic security. \u201cWith this proposal, we would be asking them to borrow against the already inadequate support they receive from Social Security.\u201d\n\nSenator Joni Ernst of Iowa, a supporter of the idea, said it would provide women with more financial security by encouraging them to stay in the work force after they have children. \u201cI think about those women that will leave the work force because that\u2019s their only option, and this provides them a way to take some time off, spend time devoted to their family and then return,\u201d she said.\n\nThe new proposal is one of several being considered by Ivanka Trump and others in the White House to expand paid leave beyond the 13 percent of workers who have access to it through their employers.\n\nThey are studying if the Social Security Administration can be used to administer paid leave, according to people briefed on their discussions. It could allow people to collect payments early, as in the plan Ms. Ernst spoke of, or it could administer a new fund, perhaps financed by payroll taxes, an idea some Democrats have proposed. The administration\u2019s goal is to get bipartisan support on what has historically not been a Republican issue.\n\nThree Republican senators \u2014 Ms. Ernst, Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah \u2014 announced this month that they supported the Social Security proposal, though they were still researching it and had not yet started writing a bill.\n\nImage Senator Marco Rubio, left, and Senator Mike Lee also support the proposal, although Mr. Lee voiced concern about the future of Social Security. Credit T.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York Times\n\nIn a conference call, the senators praised the fact that the plan would not force businesses to provide leave, would not start a new government program and would not raise taxes.\n\nBut Mr. Lee also raised concerns about the underfunding of Social Security, and whether this would accelerate its decline. That is the most controversial aspec t of the proposal, experts said, because it would apply more stress to a program that is already under pressure.\n\nStarting in 2034, Social Security will be able to pay only 75 percent of scheduled benefits, according to the latest trustees report, unless taxes are raised or benefits are trimmed. And while the chances of passing any legislation in an election year are dim, the proposal introduces a new strain of thinking about what Social Security can be used for. Another legislator, Representative Thomas Garrett, a Republican from Virginia, recently introduced a bill that would let individuals draw Social Security benefits early to pay off a portion of their student loans.\n\nMillions of retirees rely on modest checks from the program, which was created from a bill signed into law by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935. Treating Social Security as something that can be borrowed against suggests that it can be treated as an individual account rather than a social insurance program. That could open the door to privatizing the accounts, some experts said, an idea that was floated during George W. Bush\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cThis is a significant philosophy shift that doesn\u2019t look at it like an insurance program where we are all in it together, but an individual asset you can tap to pay for your individual needs,\u201d said Kathleen Romig, senior policy analyst at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nThe proposal would also begin to reshape Social Security into something more akin to 401(k) accounts: Account holders can borrow against their 401(k), or even drain it in a financial emergency (albeit with a penalty), leaving them with less savings for retirement.\n\nSocial Security, in contrast, cannot be touched and is often viewed as the last standing leg in the three-legged stool of retirement, when personal savings are not enough and pensions are increasingly rare.\n\nTo be eligible for the proposed program, a new parent would need to have a minimum amount of earnings in the years before claiming the benefit, similar to the formula used to qualify for Social Security disability benefits , according to the proposal from the Independent Women\u2019s Forum.\n\nThe size of the benefit would be calculated borrowing a formula from Social Security. A 26-year-old woman earning $31,000, for example, might receive roughly $1,175 a month in Social Security parental benefits, which replaces about 45 percent of her income, for up to 12 weeks.\n\nThe cost would come later, in the form of a reduced retirement benefit. Exactly how the reduction would be calculated is not yet entirely clear, said Andrew Biggs, a former principal deputy commissioner of the Social Security Administration who helped devise the proposal and who is now at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. But roughly speaking, he said, a 12-week leave would most likely translate to a benefit cut of 1.5 percent.\n\nThe proposal says that a parent\u2019s Social Security check would be delayed, not cut, to offset the amount gained during the paid leave.\n\nMs. Lukas said that delaying Social Security would not be a problem for most people: \u201cSixty-seven is really late middle age, and many people are really happy to continue working.\u201d\n\nYet many workers do not have a choice. And while life expectancies have increased, better-paid and more educated people tend to live longer than those who earn less.\n\nAs of now, the proposal covers new parents but not workers who are recovering from an illness or need to care for other family members. It also does not provide job security for people who take leave. The Family and Medical Leave Act does both those things, but the leave is unpaid, and only about half of workers qualify for it.\n\nThe Family Act, a bill sponsored in the Senate by Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, would create a new fund within the Social Security Administration. Employers and employees would each contribute 0.2 percent of their wages for 12 weeks of paid parental, family or medical leave.\n\nRepublicans generally object to proposals that would raise taxes, but any paid leave plan would need to be paid for. The question now facing policymakers is whether to turn t o Social Security payments, the last guaranteed safety net for many retirees, to do so.\n\nTara Siegel Bernard is a personal finance reporter.

And he said that he backed improvements to background checks and a ban on bump stocks, which can convert semiautomatic weapons to fire automatically.\n\nStudents and teachers at the event also had questions for Florida\u2019s other politicians, including two Democrats, Senator Bill Nelson and Representative Ted Deutch.\n\nPhoto\n\nOne young student talked about how her best friend was gunned down in front of her, and she asked Mr. Nelson about background checks, and how to improve them.\n\nAnother student, whose brother was killed in the shooting, bluntly said to Mr. Deutch that \u201cmy friends and I are worried that we are going to be murdered in our classrooms.\u201d He asked what Mr. Deutch was going to do about it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAs a starter,\u201d the congressman said, \u201cI\u2019m going to introduce legislation to make sure that assault weapons are illegal in every part of this country.\u201d\n\nThe audience burst out in applause.\n\nBut Mr. Rubio, who ran for president in 2016, was the primary target of ire from people at the forum, who repeatedly challenged the senator\u2019s positions on gun control and his willingness to accept donations from the National Rifle Association.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

When Mr. Rubio refused, the audience booed loudly.\n\n\u201cPeople buy into my agenda and I do support the Second Amendment,\u201d Mr. Rubio said, repeatedly refusing to say he would stop accepting money from the group. \u201cThe influence of these groups comes not from money, the influence comes from the millions of people who support the agenda.\u201d\n\nMr. Deutch at one point engaged in a brief debate with Mr. Rubio, saying that a gun that allowed the shooter to fire off 150 rounds in six to seven minutes \u201cshould be banned.\u201d\n\nLater, Chris Grady, a student at the high school, thanked Mr. Rubio for appearing at the forum, unlike President Trump and Rick Scott, the Republican governor of Florida, who both turned down invitations from CNN to participate.\n\n\u201cA lot more than can be said for our so-called president and governor,\u201d Mr. Grady told Mr. Rubio. \u201cWe need you and your colleagues on both sides to come together with us and find a compromise if we are ever to solve this epidemic that is plaguing our country.\u201d\n\nMr. Grady asked the senator whether he supported legislation to limit high-capacity magazines that allow weapons to fire many bullets quickly. Mr. Rubio said that he had long opposed such legislation, but was now reconsidering that position.\n\nMr. Rubio said that there would be evidence from the Florida school shooting that suggested the shooter might have killed fewer people if he did not have high capacity magazines.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have prevented the attack but it would have made it less lethal,\u201d the senator said.", "keywords": ["rubio", "school", "father", "shooting", "florida", "asked", "gun", "weapons", "control", "mr", "victim", "senator", "student", "support", "confronts"], "polarity": 0.05091876557785649, "subjectivity": 0.3517163518299882},

Speaks First and Loudest NRATV, the organization\u2019s online video channel, has become a little-noticed but vital forum for the dissemination of some of the most strident pro-gun messaging in politics.\n\nVideo The National Rifle Association\u2019s online video channel has a wide range of programming \u2014 and that\u2019s the point.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Whenever there is a mass shooting, the National Rifle Association has a well-rehearsed response: Say very little until the inevitable discussion about gun control cools down.\n\nBut as the leaders of the country\u2019s most influential gun advocacy group kept quiet after the school shooting last week in Parkland, Fla., that claimed 17 lives, a furious debate played out on NRATV, the organization\u2019s online video channel.\n\nIts hosts spoke chillingly of leftist plots to confiscate weapons, media conspiracies to brainwash Americans into supporting gun control and a \u201cdeep state\u201d campaign to undermine President Trump.\n\n\u201cCoastal, socialist media elites hate guns so much,\u201d said one of the hosts, Grant Stinchfield, a Second Amendment activist based in Dallas and a radio commentator, that they would take everyone\u2019s away, \u201cleaving only criminals, of course, with the firepower \u2014 and all of us at the mercy of evil.\u201d\n\nCritics of the N.R.A. say that they have observed a shift in the organization\u2019s tone since Mr. Trump was elected that is much more pugilistic, and that NRATV is where the most outrageous commentary occurs. This change, they say, seems to reflect the fact that like many organizations on the right, the N.R.A. believes it has to guard against complacency among its members with a friendly president in the White House.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no boogeyman in the White House now to make people afraid of,\u201d said Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, a gun control advocacy group. \u201cSo they have to make us afraid of one another, and that is how they will market guns in an age when they have a president beholden to them.\u201d\n\nThe channel has become a little-noticed but vital forum for the dissemination of some of the most strident pro-gun messaging in politics today, with hosts and guests who are closely allied with Mr. Trump. Few news media operations seem as in sync with the political sensibilities of the Trump era.\n\nThey attack the enemies he attacks, condemning the news media as \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201cfailing.\u201d They have questioned the credibility of the F.BI., whose failure to act on tips about the suspect in the Florida shooting has intensified criticism from conservatives seeking to discredit the bureau \u2014 this week, Dana Loesch, an N.R.A. spokeswoman, encouraged mass demonstrations outside F.B.I. offices.\n\n\"I hope that people are marching to the FBI Offices. This is a question that I've not seen #MSM cover: why is it that this individual was reported over 30 times\u2026why is it that none of these questions are being brought up?\"\n\n\u2013@DLoesch #NRA pic.twitter.com/24BNQvVN9H \u2014 NRATV (@NRATV) February 19, 2018\n\nAnd they often side with Mr. Trump in divisive cultural disputes \u2014 some of which have potent racial undercurrents \u2014 like his feuding with Black Lives Matter activists and the professional football players who knelt during the national anthem.\n\nWith broadcast television-quality production and three dozen original series, NRATV has the ability to reach millions of people through the channels that distribute it like Apple TV, Roku and Amazon Fire TV. And it has significant resources at its disposal as part of the N.R.A.\u2019s far-reaching \u201cmembership support\u201d program. In recent years, that operation alone spent $35.5 million, according to its most recent publicly available tax filing.\n\nBut it is just the newest piece of a larger news media operation inside the N.R.A. that receives little attention compared with the group\u2019s political and lobbying activity. The organization produces at least seven print and online magazines that have a combined circulation of more than 11 million, according to the N.R.A. Its biggest social media channels on Facebook and Twitter count about 8.7 million followers. On YouTube, five N.R.A.-controlled channels have shared videos that have received nearly 102 million views.\n\nAndrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the N.R.A., declined to discuss the media effort, the size of its online audience or its programming in the wake of the Parkland shooting. As a matter of policy, he said, the N.R.A. does not discuss proprietary matters.\n\nNRATV is a budding business for the organization, which has brokered sponsorship arrangements with gun makers like Kimber, Mossberg and Ruger to feature their firearms on its programs. Its series cover a range of topics and interests intended to appeal to gun owners of all kinds, like \u201cArmed and Fabulous,\u201d which profiles rifle-slinging women; \u201cFrontlines,\u201d a newsmagazine hosted by Oliver North; and \u201cUnder Wild Skies,\u201d which follows hunters in pursuit of big-game trophies.\n\nBut politics and provocation are NRATV\u2019s specialty. It has singled out news outlets and attacked individual journalists like Don Lemon of CNN, who was targeted in an ad that accused the anchor and his network of smearing Mr. Trump and colluding with Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. In one video released this month, Ms. Loesch, a former Tea Party activist and Breitbart editor, pretended she was about to burn a copy of The New York Times.\n\nStories that circulate throughout right-wing news media often find their way to NRATV, which has devoted numerous segments to portraying anti-Trump demonstrators as paid shills, violent extremists and evangelists for Shariah law in the United States.\n\nIts guests and hosts are not shy of trading in racially charged language and imagery. A promo for a program called \u201cNoir\u201d featuring a Navy SEAL member named Dom Raso opens with a dramatization of a foiled robbery. A black man wielding a knife grabs and forces a white woman to the ground as an armed bystander reaches for his handgun and rushes to her defense.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration last year, an NRATV correspondent, Chuck Holton, tweeted that it was time to \u201cget busy scrubbing Obama\u2019s mocacchino stain off of America!\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to the color of President Barack Obama\u2019s skin.\n\nOkay! Party's over. Let's get busy scrubbing Obama's mocacchino stain off of America! \u2014 Chuck Holton (@rangerholton) January 22, 2017\n\nThe N.R.A.\u2019s practice is to keep a low profile after mass shootings, as it did after the massacres in Newtown, Conn., and at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. But it was always quietly talking to its members, first by email and later on NRATV, said Danny Barefoot, a partner at Anvil Strategies, an ad agency and communications company that has worked with gun control groups.\n\n\u201cIn those moments, the goal isn\u2019t to disseminate mass information and persuade a lot of people, \u201d Mr. Barefoot said. \u201cThe strategy is to be a messenger to the N.R.A.\u2019s own people.\u201d\n\nEli Pariser, the co-founder of Upworthy, a site that delivered progressive political videos to targeted audiences on Facebook, said that while videos produced by NRATV after a shooting might not go viral, they helped viewers \u201cfeel they\u2019re part of a community, led by a news source that speaks to them.\u201d\n\nNRATV can galvanize members in the wake of a shooting in part because the N.R.A. has coached its followers to believe that the organization is the only credible source for news and information on any gun issue or controversy.\n\nNRATV\u2019s slogan \u2014 \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Patriotic Team on a Mission to Take Back The Truth\u201d \u2014 reinforces a sense of mistrust in traditional news media, as do its hosts. In the days after the Parkland shooting, Mr. Stinchfield and Ms. Loesch, two of the channel\u2019s most prominent faces, were relentless in their attacks on the news media.\n\nImage Technicians at NRATV preparing the broadcast set on Wednesday at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland. Credit Pete Marovich for The New York Times\n\n\u201cIf it can topple us, it gets a direct path to the Second Amendment,\u201d Mr. Stinchfield told viewers this week from the organization\u2019s studio in Dallas. \u201cThey will stop at nothing to put us out of business.\u201d\n\nSome of his more recent antics have included taking a sledgehammer to a television set as clips from MSNBC, CNN and ABC play onscreen, and inviting North Korea to launch a nuclear weapon on Sacramento, where the California state legislature has approved numerous gun control measures opposed by the N.R.A.\n\nMr. Stinchfield went on to question the competence and motivation of the F.B.I. \u201cIt is time the F.B.I. got back to the business of keeping Americans safe, instead of being so focused on political vendettas,\u201d he said. He then turned the microphone over to Mr. Holton, who saw a slippery slope in new gun regulations and identified a new culprit in the proliferation of school shootings: the news media.\n\n\u201cPeople could just as easily call for restrictions on the first amendment,\u201d Mr. Holton said. \u201cThey could say, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s make it illegal to report on those school shootings because we all know, I mean, there\u2019s no doubt that the media circus that takes place every time one of these things happens causes more school shootings.\u201d\n\nJeremy W.

He raised a particular concern over conflicting statements from Mr. Pruitt\u2019s press office about whether the administrator had a waiver to fly first class at all times.\n\nImage Representative Trey Gowdy has asked that Mr. Pruitt\u2019s travel information be handed over by March 6. Credit Al Drago for The New York Times\n\n\u201cClearly, federal regulations prohibit a blanket waiver to fly first class except to accommodate disabilities or special needs,\u201d Mr. Gowdy wrote in a letter. \u201cInstead, a waiver is required for each flight in order to fly first or business class when traveling on official government business.\u201d\n\nMr. Pruitt has been under fire for his travel since The Washington Post reported that he routinely flies first or business class, and that he and top aides had spent more than $90,000 on airfare in the first few weeks of June alone.\n\nJahan Wilcox, a spokesman for the E.P.A., initially issued a statement that said that Mr. Pruitt had a \u201cblanket waiver\u201d to fly first class out of concern for his security. Mr. Wilcox later amended that to say that the E.P.A. did in fact submit a waiver for each trip.\n\nAccording to the General Services Administration\u2019s regulations for travel by federal employees, \u201cblanket authorization\u201d of anything other than coach-fare travel is barred except for reasons related to a disability or special need, and authorization for first-class travel is given on a \u201ctrip-by-trip\u201d basis.\n\nMr. Pruitt has long been a target of criticism from Democrats, who last week asked the E.P.A.\u2019s inspector general to expand an existing investigation into the administrator\u2019s trips. But the issue of first-class travel has also struck a nerve with a handful of Republicans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised at the expense of it,\u201d Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia said in an interview last week. \u201cGood stewardship of the federal dollar is important to me, and it should be to him.\u201d\n\nMr. Gowdy asked that Mr. Pruitt\u2019s travel information be handed over by 5 p.m. on March 6.

He also expressed a willingness to challenge the legal foundation of federal climate-change policy, the 2009 Environmental Protection Agency decision known as the \u201cendangerment finding,\u201d which declares that greenhouse gases are harmful to human health and must be regulated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to say \u2018no,\u2019\u201d Mr. van der Vaart said when asked if he would support repealing the endangerment finding.\n\nSome activists who deny established climate-change science, like Myron Ebell at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank, support Mr. van der Vaart\u2019s potential nomination, saying he combines more than 25 years of regulatory experience with a unique background as both a lawyer and chemical engineer. In addition, Mr. Ebell said, Mr. van der Vaart\u2019s climate views are closely aligned with those of the previous nominee, Kathleen Hartnett White, who was withdrawn from consideration this month.\n\n\u201cHaving lost Kathleen, which saddens me, I think Donald van der Vaart is a good alternative. He brings many of the same strengths,\u201d Mr. Ebell said. And, he noted, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a long and open trail of speeches and comments,\u201d like Ms. White does, in which opponents can look for ammunition.\n\nMs. White, a former chairwoman of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, came under fire from both parties for her environmental views. Democrats attacked her for suggesting that smog is not harmful and for calling carbon dioxide the \u201cgas of life.\u201d (Carbon dioxide is a major contributor to climate change.) She also said that an E.P.A. standard that requires increasing the amount of ethanol in the nation\u2019s fuel supply should be repealed, angering Midwestern Republicans.\n\nSenator Tom Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said he found Ms. White\u2019s views so unsettling that he mounted a campaign to block her confirmation. Mr. Carper said he visited the offices of 16 Republican senators to voice his concerns, bringing with him an iPad in order to play a three-minute video that his staff had compiled of Ms. White struggling to respond to questions posed by both Republicans and Democrats at her hearing.\n\nIn an interview last week, Mr. Carper said he believed his effort had played a part in ending Ms. White\u2019s nomination. Several lawmakers, including Susan Collins of Maine and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, acknowledged through their press officers meeting with Mr. Carper but declined to comment on whether the effort swayed them.\n\nJohn Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming and the chairman of the Senate environment panel, said in a statement that withdrawing Ms. White\u2019s nomination from consideration \u201cwas her decision.\u201d\n\nMs. White declined to discuss either her appearance before the committee or Mr. Carper\u2019s video compilation. The Texas Public Policy Foundation, where Ms. White works as a senior fellow, also declined to comment, as did the White House.\n\nThe administration did not respond to a separate request to discuss the candidates now under consideration to lead the Council on Environmental Quality. The short list also includes Mary Neumayr, who as the agency\u2019s chief of staff since March has been doing the job in an acting capacity for nearly a year, said Jeffrey Holmstead, a partner at the firm Bracewell and a former E.P.A. air chief.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been a steady hand at C.E.Q. since she got there and everyone thinks she\u2019s been doing a great job,\u201d Mr. Holmstead said. But, he added, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that she wants the attention that comes with being the chair and having to run the gantlet of the confirmation process.\u201d\n\nCalls to the Council on Environmental Quality were not returned.\n\nMs. Neumayr\u2019s views on topics like climate change are far less well known than Mr. van der Vaart\u2019s.\n\nMr. van der Vaart said last week that while he believes human emissions contribute to climate change, \u201cthe accuracy of the modeling is such that on the one hand I\u2019m not sure we know what the fraction of man-made climate change is.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so important to know what that fraction is for us to develop a solution,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s no good spending a lot of money when it turns out that\u2019s not going to help you. All I\u2019m saying is, yes, we contribute. But I\u2019m not prepared to say it\u2019s the only factor.\u201d\n\nLate last year, 13 federal agencies found with high confidence that more than 92 percent of the observed rise in global average temperatures since 1950 is the direct result of human activity.\n\nMr. van der Vaart also offered support for another area that has invited criticism: the \u201cred team-blue team\u201d debates to critique climate science that Scott Pruitt, administrator of the E.P.A., told Congress recently he still intends to hold.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a great idea to debate issues,\u201d Mr. van der Vaart said. \u201cThe question is, how do you actually do it? Do you have one debate? Do you have 10 debates? It\u2019s a very attractive notion, but I\u2019d like to think and talk to a lot of people about how to best implement that.\u201d\n\nLisa Friedman reports on climate and environmental policy in Washington.

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/upshot/gerrymandering-pennsylvania-democrats-republicans-court.html", "text": "Advertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats Didn\u2019t Even Dream of This Pennsylvania Map. How Did It Happen? They seemed not to believe that they would be allowed to strive for partisan balance in addressing Republican gerrymandering.\n\nFew people expected that the Pennsylvania congressional map, which the state Supreme Court ordered redrawn to undo Republican gerrymandering, would prove to be as favorable to Democrats as the one adopted by the court on Monday.\n\nPerhaps the easiest way to convey the cause for surprise: The new map is better for Democrats \u2014 by nearly every measure \u2014 than the maps that Democrats themselves proposed.\n\nHow could that be?\n\nIt is hard to explain. Perhaps all four Democratic map proposals reflected an earnest effort to reach a compromise with Republicans. The more likely explanation is that Democrats did not believe it was realistic to demand such a favorable map, since it would require a series of Democratic-leaning choices. And the court order did not specify that the maps should aim for partisan balance, which might have justified a more Democratic map.\n\nApparently, a more favorable map was quite realistic; after all, it is now a reality, one that gives a significant boost to Democratic hopes of retaking the House. It\u2019s a reality because the newly adopted map consistently makes subtle choices that nudge districts in the direction of Democrats.\n\nMany of those choices are easy to spot on a map. Every potentially competitive Republican-held district juts out to add Democratic areas, like adding York to the 10th District, Lansdale to the First District, Reading to the Sixth District, Stroudsburg to the Seventh District, South Philadelphia to the Fifth District, or Mount Lebanon and Penn Hills to the 17th.\n\nThere are also subtle choices that are harder to see. They\u2019re less about picking and choosing municipalities and more about how to group counties. These choices also often work to the advantage of Democrats, like the decision to center the 12th District in Beaver rather than in Butler County, or to have the Fifth District, rather than the Fourth or the First, take population in Philadelphia.\n\nAny of these decisions can be justified. It is also possible, although unlikely and unproven, that only this combination of choices yields the absolute minimum number of split counties or municipalities, the key criterion of the court order.\n\nBut in all of these cases, there were Republican-leaning alternatives of seemingly comparable merit. Collectively, it\u2019s a pattern of augmenting Democratic strength, inching the statewide map closer to partisan parity.\n\nThis does not necessarily mean the map amounts to a \u201cDemocratic gerrymander,\u201d as some have suggested. Over all, it admirably adheres to traditional nonpartisan redistricting criteria, like compactness and the avoidance of unnecessary county splits. But the map makes Democratic-tilting choices so consistently that it is hard not to wonder whether it was part of an intentional effort to achieve partisan balance in a state that is fairly evenly divided.\n\nIt would be somewhat surprising, at least to me, if the court drew this map without that goal in mind. Nathaniel Persily, the Stanford professor who helped draw the map, has been barred by the court from discussing it.\n\nA series of pro-Democratic choices would be necessary to create statewide partisan balance, since lopsided winning margins in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh put Democrats at a considerable disadvantage in translating their votes to seats statewide. In fact, the new map still slightly advantages the Republicans with respect to the statewide popular vote.\n\nPerhaps it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise if the court strove for partisan symmetry in the context of a partisan gerrymandering case. But the court order did not say that the maps should strive for partisan balance, and it seems that\u2019s the reason Democrats did not strive for it, either.\n\nMichael McDonald, an associate professor at the University of Florida, suggests Democrats held back from greater ambition in part because they were protecting incumbents. But there was only one plausibly vulnerable Democratic incumbent to protect, Matt Cartwright, and there is little reason to believe the effort to protect him weakened the Democratic proposals.\n\nMr. Cartwright\u2019s new district voted for President Trump by 10 points; in the Democratic proposals, the district voted for Mr. Trump by an average of nine points. Just as important, even a concerted effort to protect him would have little effect on the overall statewide map. It would be enough to flip the old 15th District from Mr. Trump to Hillary Clinton (going by 2016 results) but no more. And it wouldn\u2019t flip the 15th District in the other contests where Democrats generally fared better, like the 2012 presidential election.\n\nThe map comes close to maximizing the number of Democratic opportunities while complying with the court\u2019s order to minimize county, municipality or precinct splits except to make sure each district has about the same number of people. Perhaps the only plausible way to substantially improve Democratic chances from here would be to split the city of Pittsburgh, an unlikely choice given the requirement to avoid unnecessarily splitting municipalities.\n\nOver all, it\u2019s a huge lift to Democrats\u2019 chances. In this political environment, they\u2019d probably be favored to gain around four seats in the state, up from the two they were favored to carry before. They are overwhelming favorites to win the new versions of the old Seventh and modest favorites to win the old Sixth and 15th, with very good additional opportunities in the old Eighth and 12th, and two long-shot options in the old Third and Fourth.\n\nAlone, the approximately two-seat shift toward the Democrats improves the party\u2019s chance of reclaiming the House by around 5 percent, and even more if the race remains so competitive heading into Election Day. It further diminishes the already deteriorating Republican structural advantages \u2014 including incumbency and geography \u2014 that have long been the key to G.O.P. hopes of surviving a so-called wave election in the House.\n\nAt the beginning of the cycle, it was hard to identify more than a dozen national races where Democrats would have a 50-50 or better chance to win in a wave election. After this decision \u2014 and months of strong Democratic recruitment and a wave of Republican retirements \u2014 it\u2019s a lot easier to come up with the two dozen seats they need to flip the House. Depending on how recruitment shakes out, five of the party\u2019s best 24 opportunities might now be in Pennsylvania.\n\nNate Cohn is a domestic correspondent for The Upshot.

Powell testifying before the Senate Banking Committee in November during hearings on his nomination to head the Federal Reserve. Credit Joshua Roberts/Reuters\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Robust economic growth has increased the confidence of Federal Reserve officials that the economy is ready for higher interest rates, according to an official account of the central bank\u2019s most recent policymaking meeting in late January.\n\nThe Fed did not raise its benchmark interest rate at the meeting on Jan. 30 and 31, but the account reinforced investor expectations the Fed would raise rates at its next meeting in March.\n\nThe account said Fed officials have upgraded their economic outlooks since the beginning of the year and listed three main reasons: The strength of recent economic data, accommodative financial conditions and the expected impact of the $1.5 trillion tax cut that took effect in January.\n\n\u201cThe effects of recently enacted tax changes \u2014 while still uncertain \u2014 might be somewhat larger in the near term than previously thought,\u201d said the meeting account, which the Fed published Wednesday after a standard three-week delay.\n\nThe Fed is seeking to raise rates gradually to maintain control of inflation without impeding an economic expansion that is nearing the end of its ninth year, one of the longest stretches of continuous economic growth in American history.\n\nA wave of turbulence passed through global equity markets in the days after the Fed\u2019s January meeting. The government reported an unexpected increase in wages, and investors worried the Fed would respond by raising rates a little more quickly. Then Congress passed a plan increasing government spending, tossing more logs onto the fire.\n\nSo far, however, Fed officials have treated the stronger economic news as a reason to carry out their plans for gradual rate hikes, rather than as a reason to start raising rates more quickly. Most Fed officials predicted in December the Fed would raise rates three times in 2018, as it did last year.\n\n\u201cIf the economy evolves as I anticipate, I believe further increases in interest rates will be appropriate this year and next year, at a pace similar to last year\u2019s,\u201d Loretta Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said this month.\n\nIn the policy statement the Fed issued after the January meeting, the central bank outlined its approach to raising rates, saying it \u201cexpects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate.\u201d\n\nThe meeting account said the addition of the word \u201cfurther\u201d in that statement reflected the increased confidence among officials that the Fed would continue raising rates.\n\nImage The day\u2019s numbers are displayed after the closing bell of the Dow Industrial Average at the New York Stock Exchange on Feb. 15. Credit Bryan R. Smith/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\n\nJesse Edgerton, an economist at JPMorgan Chase, said the Fed\u2019s increased confidence was likely to translate eventually into more interest rate increases than the three Fed officials predicted.\n\n\u201cWe think increased confidence in the need for further hikes will accompany a perceived need for more than three hikes among a growing portion of the committee,\u201d he wrote Wednesday.\n\nAnd the minutes did suggest the Fed might eventually raise rates to a level higher than financial markets presently anticipate. Fed officials predicted in December that the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate would come to rest around 2.8 percent, well below its precrisis level. The rate is currently in a range between 1.25 percent and 1.5 percent.\n\nAt the January meeting, some Fed officials raised the possibility that the strength of economic growth might raise that ceiling. The Fed would welcome such a development, because it would preserve more room to reduce rates in future downturns.\n\nThe persistent question mark is inflation. The Fed aims to keep prices rising at an annual rate of 2 percent, but it has consistently fallen short of that goal since the end of the last recession in 2009.\n\nThe minutes said the Fed has gained some confidence in its prediction that inflation will rise toward 2 percent. The economy continues to gain strength, and the minutes said a decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar was also likely to put upward pressure on inflation. Lower exchange rates translate into higher prices for imported goods.\n\nBut the Fed has made the same predictions repeatedly, without success, and the minutes said the Fed intends to raise rates slowly as it continues to watch inflation closely. Some officials argue that the Fed should stop raising rates until inflation shows clear signs of revival.\n\nThe Fed has good reason for its uncertainty about inflation: It lacks a convincing explanation of what causes inflation, or a model that accurately predicts future inflation.\n\nIn a presentation at the January meeting, economists on the Fed\u2019s staff told policymakers that the most popular explanations had significant flaws. One class of theories says inflation is produced by excess demand for available resources. This suggests inflation should rise as growth approaches its natural speed limit, a pattern that can be seen in some historical data but is difficult to find in recent decades. Another class of theories argues, with some circularity, that inflation is determined by expectations about inflation. It is not clear, however, how those expectations are formed.\n\nThe account said that \u201calmost all\u201d Fed officials responded by expressing a continued commitment to both theories. They said they intended to raise interest rates as the economy gains strength, and to seek to maintain public confidence in the 2 percent inflation target.\n\nThe January meeting was the final meeting for Janet L. Yellen, who concluded her four-year term as the Fed\u2019s chairwoman in early February. Her successor, Jerome H. Powell, is scheduled to make his public debut when he testifies before House and Senate committees next week.\n\nFollow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe All-New DealBook Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.

Mr. Murphy sued the guards, winning about $307,000 and $108,000 in attorney\u2019s fees.\n\nThe question in the case was how to interpret a federal law that says in such cases \u201ca portion of the judgment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney\u2019s fees awarded against the defendant.\u201d\n\nA trial judge ordered Mr. Murphy to pay 10 percent of his award to his lawyers, but an appeals court ruled that the law required the full 25 percent.\n\nJustice Gorsuch, writing for the majority, said the law left no room for judicial discretion. \u201cWhen you purposefully seek or aim \u2018to satisfy\u2019 an obligation, especially a financial obligation, that usually means you intend to discharge the obligation in full,\u201d he wrote. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Anthony M.

The appeals court refused to consider the arguments, saying that Mr. Class had waived them by pleading guilty.\n\nJustice Breyer, writing for the majority, said, \u201cClass\u2019s valid guilty plea does not, by itself, bar direct appeal of his constitutional claims in these circumstances.\u201d Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor, Kagan and Gorsuch joined the majority opinion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn dissent, Justice Alito wrote that the majority had provided no clear guidance about when appeals after guilty pleas are permitted. \u201cThere is no justification for the muddle left by today\u2019s decision,\u201d he wrote, adding: \u201cI fear that today\u2019s decision will bedevil the lower courts.\u201d Justices Kennedy and Thomas joined Justice Alito\u2019s dissent in the case, Class v.

By law, officers can go onto private property within 25 miles of the border without permission from the owner.\n\nRicardo D. Palacios, the owner of the Juan Salinas Ranch, said in court filings that Border Patrol officers had been \u201croaming freely about\u201d for years on his property near the small town of Encinal, Tex. He said that the searches were conducted with neither a warrant nor a good reason to be there, and that officers also had stopped his family members at checkpoints.\n\nThe last straw, Mr. Palacios said in court documents, came in November, when he found a surveillance camera hidden in a tree near his house.\n\nMr. Palacios removed the camera and kept it as evidence of federal officers trespassing on his property. Both the Border Patrol and the Texas Department of Public Safety claimed ownership of the camera and have asked Mr. Palacios to return it. State officials have threatened to arrest him on theft charges. Mr. Palacios sued both agencies.\n\nRaul Casso, a lawyer for Mr. Palacios, said the ranch is more than 30 miles from the Rio Grande, which divides the United States and Mexico. He said that put Mr. Palacios\u2019s property beyond the distance that Border Patrol officers can legally patrol without his permission.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey either acted on purpose or incompetently,\u201d said Mr. Casso, a former lawyer for the city of Laredo. \u201cEither way, they are outside the scope of their authority.\u201d Customs and Border Protection officials declined to comment on the case.\n\nIn New Hampshire, the A.C.L.U. is defending 18 people who were arrested at immigration checkpoints on a major interstate where Border Patrol officers stopped hundreds of cars about 90 miles from the Canadian border over the summer. Checkpoints on Interstate 93 were common after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, but had abated by July 2012, Border Patrol officials said.\n\nBorder Patrol officers detained about 33 people on suspicion of immigration-related offenses at checkpoints in northern New Hampshire in August and September; the local police charged an additional 44 with drug possession. In all, the authorities seized about two pounds of marijuana and smaller amounts of cocaine and other drugs, court records show.\n\nGilles Bissonnette, the legal director for New Hampshire\u2019s A.C.L.U. chapter, said the Border Patrol violated state law by conducting the drug searches. He said that New Hampshire courts have held that without a warrant, the authorities cannot deploy drug-sniffing dogs in searches \u2014 as they were at the checkpoints \u2014 without a reasonable suspicion of a crime.\n\n\u201cThey were supposed to be conducting immigration checks,\u201d Mr. Bissonnette said. The checkpoints must be brief and limited to confirming resident status, he said, not primarily used for drug searches or general law enforcement efforts.\n\nNew Hampshire officials maintain that the Border Patrol officers were in their jurisdiction since the checkpoints were under 100 miles from the Canadian border.\n\n\u201cThese are federal agents working for a federal agency performing a federal function within the federation of states,\u201d said Gabriel Nizetic, a lawyer in the state who represented a local police department that participated in the checkpoints.

But what has made it easier for the Trump skeptics to come around is that the president has governed more like a conventional Republican than the populist he campaigned as in 2016.\n\n\u201cNafta is alive and the alliance with Russia is dead,\u201d said Luke Thompson, a Republican strategist. \u201cTrump surrendered to the Republican Congress on policy.\u201d\n\nAnd many of those Republican voters uneasy with the president\u2019s coarse language have noticed.\n\n\u201cThe base is making their judgments on what has been accomplished as opposed to what is being said,\u201d said Chris LaCivita, a longtime Republican consultant.\n\nSo the likes of Mr. Heller and Ms. McSally, who is running for Mr. Flake\u2019s seat, have determined they have little choice but to embrace Mr. Trump to survive their primaries. Ms. McSally is facing a pair of hard-line opponents, including the former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and Mr. Heller is being challenged from the right by Danny Tarkanian, a conservative businessman and a son of a legendary basketball coach at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\n\nMr. Trump has stayed out of both primaries despite his relationship with Mr. Arpaio, whom he pardoned, and the importuning of a former Arizona state senator, Kelli Ward, and Mr. Tarkanian.\n\nMs. Ward went to Mar-a-Lago, the president\u2019s resort in Florida, over the holidays in hopes of swaying Mr. Trump. Mr. Tarkanian announced his candidacy on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d last summer in the predawn darkness of Las Vegas in hopes of catching the president\u2019s attention.\n\nStill, Mr. Heller and Ms. McSally may have created risks for themselves in the general election by welcoming the support of a president who polls show is not broadly liked in Nevada or Arizona.\n\n\u201cIf he stays where he is, it\u2019s a liability,\u201d Mr. Flake said.\n\nMr. Romney faces no such general-election risks in Utah, where he is seen as the beau ideal of the Mormon Church, and which has not elected a Democratic senator since 1970.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut by tempering his criticism of Mr. Trump, Mr. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential standard-bearer, has all but eliminated whatever nuisance challenge he might have faced from his right flank. By posting Monday on Twitter that Mr. Romney \u201cwill make a great Senator,\u201d Mr. Trump snuffed out any attempt to halt the political revival of the man who was perhaps his most prominent Republican critic in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe only place where Mitt was even slightly vulnerable was with a pro-Trump challenger, and this takes that off the table,\u201d said Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox of Utah.\n\nAs for Mr. Corker, who would face the conservative Representative Marsha Blackburn in a primary race, he has yet to sway Mr. Trump.\n\nBut the president\u2019s aides, who are more apt to hold grudges, are all too aware of Mr. Trump\u2019s weakness for flattery and are doing their best to keep him from blessing Mr. Corker. It was no accident, one West Wing official noted, that they placed Ms. Blackburn near the president\u2019s side last Friday for a bill signing that otherwise drew little attention.", "keywords": ["critics", "president", "romney", "presidents", "ms", "white", "mr", "trumps", "trump", "senator", "heller", "support", "sudden", "need", "republican"], "polarity": 0.1690048634493079, "subjectivity": 0.4408970658970658},

But policymakers don\u2019t agree on what a leave plan should look like. Now some Republicans have a new idea: Let people collect Social Security benefits early to pay for time off after they have a baby.\n\nUnlike some other proposals, this would require no new taxes. There\u2019s a catch, though: Parents would have their Social Security benefits delayed when they retire to offset the costs.\n\nSocial Security has long been viewed as an untouchable part of the social safety net. By letting people tap it for parental leave, it would begin to feel more like an individual account \u2014 an idea conservatives have been trying to advance for decades.\n\nImage Senator Joni Ernst said she supported the idea because it would provide an option for new mothers who might otherwise leave the work force. Credit Eric Thayer for The New York Times\n\nThe new parental leave plan comes from a right-leaning group called the Independent Women\u2019s Forum, and its president, Carrie Lukas, who said Social Security was based on an antiquated idea of working life. \u201cWomen are a bigger part of the work force now, and they need support at different times of their lives rather than just starting at 67,\u201d she said.\n\nMore broadly, Ms. Lukas has said that she hoped the proposal would \u201cencourage an important mental shift\u201d in the way people think about Social Security. If individuals view it as \u201cproperty,\u201d she reasons, it could lead to the embrace of personal accounts.\n\nThat reasoning is why some experts view the proposal as a backdoor way to try to curb the scale and cost of Social Security. They also said it could put women in a more precarious position in retirement, adding yet another financial penalty to the list that women pay when they become mothers. Women have lower earnings, smaller Social Security benefits and less financial security in retirement because they spend a disproportionate amount of time away from work to raise children, research shows. Drawing down their Social Security benefits early could compound the problem.\n\n\u201cHere you have a situation where women live longer, but they tend to live both sicker and poorer because of the caregiving they do,\u201d said Debra Ness, president of the National Partnership for Women & Families, a nonprofit that champions women\u2019s economic security. \u201cWith this proposal, we would be asking them to borrow against the already inadequate support they receive from Social Security.\u201d\n\nSenator Joni Ernst of Iowa, a supporter of the idea, said it would provide women with more financial security by encouraging them to stay in the work force after they have children. \u201cI think about those women that will leave the work force because that\u2019s their only option, and this provides them a way to take some time off, spend time devoted to their family and then return,\u201d she said.\n\nThe new proposal is one of several being considered by Ivanka Trump and others in the White House to expand paid leave beyond the 13 percent of workers who have access to it through their employers.\n\nThey are studying if the Social Security Administration can be used to administer paid leave, according to people briefed on their discussions. It could allow people to collect payments early, as in the plan Ms. Ernst spoke of, or it could administer a new fund, perhaps financed by payroll taxes, an idea some Democrats have proposed. The administration\u2019s goal is to get bipartisan support on what has historically not been a Republican issue.\n\nThree Republican senators \u2014 Ms. Ernst, Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah \u2014 announced this month that they supported the Social Security proposal, though they were still researching it and had not yet started writing a bill.\n\nImage Senator Marco Rubio, left, and Senator Mike Lee also support the proposal, although Mr. Lee voiced concern about the future of Social Security. Credit T.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York Times\n\nIn a conference call, the senators praised the fact that the plan would not force businesses to provide leave, would not start a new government program and would not raise taxes.\n\nBut Mr. Lee also raised concerns about the underfunding of Social Security, and whether this would accelerate its decline. That is the most controversial aspec t of the proposal, experts said, because it would apply more stress to a program that is already under pressure.\n\nStarting in 2034, Social Security will be able to pay only 75 percent of scheduled benefits, according to the latest trustees report, unless taxes are raised or benefits are trimmed. And while the chances of passing any legislation in an election year are dim, the proposal introduces a new strain of thinking about what Social Security can be used for. Another legislator, Representative Thomas Garrett, a Republican from Virginia, recently introduced a bill that would let individuals draw Social Security benefits early to pay off a portion of their student loans.\n\nMillions of retirees rely on modest checks from the program, which was created from a bill signed into law by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935. Treating Social Security as something that can be borrowed against suggests that it can be treated as an individual account rather than a social insurance program. That could open the door to privatizing the accounts, some experts said, an idea that was floated during George W. Bush\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cThis is a significant philosophy shift that doesn\u2019t look at it like an insurance program where we are all in it together, but an individual asset you can tap to pay for your individual needs,\u201d said Kathleen Romig, senior policy analyst at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nThe proposal would also begin to reshape Social Security into something more akin to 401(k) accounts: Account holders can borrow against their 401(k), or even drain it in a financial emergency (albeit with a penalty), leaving them with less savings for retirement.\n\nSocial Security, in contrast, cannot be touched and is often viewed as the last standing leg in the three-legged stool of retirement, when personal savings are not enough and pensions are increasingly rare.\n\nTo be eligible for the proposed program, a new parent would need to have a minimum amount of earnings in the years before claiming the benefit, similar to the formula used to qualify for Social Security disability benefits , according to the proposal from the Independent Women\u2019s Forum.\n\nThe size of the benefit would be calculated borrowing a formula from Social Security. A 26-year-old woman earning $31,000, for example, might receive roughly $1,175 a month in Social Security parental benefits, which replaces about 45 percent of her income, for up to 12 weeks.\n\nThe cost would come later, in the form of a reduced retirement benefit. Exactly how the reduction would be calculated is not yet entirely clear, said Andrew Biggs, a former principal deputy commissioner of the Social Security Administration who helped devise the proposal and who is now at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. But roughly speaking, he said, a 12-week leave would most likely translate to a benefit cut of 1.5 percent.\n\nThe proposal says that a parent\u2019s Social Security check would be delayed, not cut, to offset the amount gained during the paid leave.\n\nMs. Lukas said that delaying Social Security would not be a problem for most people: \u201cSixty-seven is really late middle age, and many people are really happy to continue working.\u201d\n\nYet many workers do not have a choice. And while life expectancies have increased, better-paid and more educated people tend to live longer than those who earn less.\n\nAs of now, the proposal covers new parents but not workers who are recovering from an illness or need to care for other family members. It also does not provide job security for people who take leave. The Family and Medical Leave Act does both those things, but the leave is unpaid, and only about half of workers qualify for it.\n\nThe Family Act, a bill sponsored in the Senate by Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, would create a new fund within the Social Security Administration. Employers and employees would each contribute 0.2 percent of their wages for 12 weeks of paid parental, family or medical leave.\n\nRepublicans generally object to proposals that would raise taxes, but any paid leave plan would need to be paid for.

The movie garnered almost universal acclaim from reviewers and earned an estimated $387 million in its opening weekend. It\u2019s already the highest-grossing film of all time by a black director (Ryan Coogler, who also directed \u201cCreed\u201d and \u201cFruitvale Station\u201d).

Today, though, there appears to be a widening cultural appreciation for what black people have always known: There are many ways to be black in America.\u201d\n\n\u2018Why \u2018Black Panther\u2019 Is a Defining Moment for Black America\u2019 [The New York Times Magazine]\n\nRyan Coogler\u2019s film is a vivid re-imagination of something black Americans have cherished for centuries, writes Carvell Wallace: Africa as a dream of wholeness, greatness and self-realization. \u201cWe have for centuries sought to either find or create a promised land where we would be untroubled by the criminal horrors of our American existence,\u201d he writes, and Coogler is contributing to those deeply held aspirations.\n\n\u2018\u201cBlack Panther\u201d Forces Africans and Black Americans to Reconcile the Past\u2019 [Buzzfeed]\n\n\u201cBlack Panther,\u201d writes Kovie Biakolo, tackles the intricacies of identity in the African diaspora. \u201cWhat if the African diaspora could point to a country with a history unpenetrated by oppressive contact with Europeans?\u201d she asks, and makes the case that in the film, viewers can now find this in the nation of Wakanda.\n\n\u2018The Revolutionary Power of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d\u2019 [Time]\n\nJamil Smith revisits the Black Power movement, explores the origins of Black Panther and discusses issues of representation and identity with Coogler and his cast in this wide-ranging cover story. He points out that \u201cBlack Panther\u201d is \u201cboth a black film and the newest entrant in the most bankable movie franchise in history,\u201d and he rightly predicts that, \u201cFor a wary and risk-averse film business, led largely by white film executives who have been historically predisposed to greenlight projects featuring characters who look like them, \u2018Black Panther\u2019 will offer proof that a depiction of a reality of something other than whiteness can make a ton of money.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cBlack Panther\u201d and the Invention of \u201cAfrica\u201d\u2019 [The New Yorker]\n\n\u201cAfrica \u2014 or, rather, \u2018Africa\u2019 \u2014 is a creation of a white world and the literary, academic, cinematic and political mechanisms that it used to give mythology the credibility of truth,\u201d Jelani Cobb observes in an essay on how the film addresses the West\u2019s long history of exploiting Africans. \u201cNo such nation as Wakanda exists on the map of the continent, but that is entirely beside the point. Wakanda is no more or less imaginary than the Africa conjured by Hume or Trevor-Roper, or the one canonized in such Hollywood offerings as \u2018Tarzan.\u2019 It is a redemptive counter-mythology.\u201d\n\nThe Women of Wakanda\n\n\u2018Finally, \u201cBlack Panther\u201d Is a Movie Black Women Can Celebrate\u2019 [Independent]\n\nThe film is earning heaps of praise for its female characters. The journalist and activist Adebola Lamuye writes: \u201cFor those of us who have struggled to find multifaceted representations of ourselves, this is it. The dark-skinned female superhero finally looks like me, my sister, my mother, my friends. Female suffering is not used as a narrative device \u2014 instead women are the best spies Wakanda has to offer, fearless warriors and scientific genius responsible for the nation\u2019s technological advancements.\u201d\n\n\u2018Kevin Feige on the Future of Marvel\u2019s Women\u2019 [Vulture]\n\nWill \u201cBlack Panther\u201d fan favorites like Lupita Nyong\u2019o\u2019s Nakia and Letitia Wright\u2019s Shuri ever get their own movies? \u201cIt is all about figuring out when and how,\u201d said Kevin Feige, the president of Marvel Studios, in an interview with Vulture\u2019s Kyle Buchanan. \u201cBut by the way, many of them have already filmed additional scenes in upcoming movies, so some of that is gonna come sooner rather than later.

Carter designed costumes for \u201cDo the Right Thing,\u201d \u201cMalcolm X,\u201d \u201cLove & Basketball\u201d and many other films before clothing the nation of Wakanda in \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d In an interview with Channing Hargrove, she explained: \u201cOur aesthetic was always to bring about positive visuals to the African diaspora in this country. And to dispel stereotypes. To be about a forward-thinking community that empowered the black community, women and even natural hair.\u201d\n\nA Few Thought-Provoking Critiques\n\n\u2018\u201cBlack Panther\u201d Is Great. But Let\u2019s Not Treat It as an Act of Resistance.\u2019 [The Guardian]\n\n\n\nAlthough she\u2019s as excited about the film as anyone else, the writer Khanya Khondlo Mtshali cautions viewers, \u201cIf we behave as though purchasing a ticket to see a film produced by Disney is a form of resistance, we fail to distinguish between black art that touches on revolutionary themes, and the actual work required for revolution itself.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cBlack Panther\u201d Is Not the Movie We Deserve\u2019 [Boston Review]\n\nChristopher Lebron was troubled by Coogler\u2019s representation of black American men. \u201cIn 2018, a world home to both the Movement for Black Lives and a president who identifies white supremacists as fine people, we are given a movie about black empowerment where the only redeemed blacks are African nobles,\u201d he writes. \u201cThey safeguard virtue and goodness against the threat not of white Americans or Europeans, but a black American man, the most dangerous person in the world.\u201d\n\nThe Rumored Love Story That Never Panned Out\n\n\u2018\u201cBlack Panther\u201d Screenwriter Joe Robert Cole Addresses Rumors of a Deleted Gay Scene\u2019 [ScreenCrush]\n\nLast spring, Vanity Fair\u2019s Joanna Robinson got her hands on early footage of a flirtatious moment between two female characters, Danai Gurira\u2019s Okoye and Florence Kasumba\u2019s Ayo. The scene never made it into the movie. So, what happened? In a conversation with ScreenCrush\u2019s E. Oliver Whitney, the screenwriter Joe Robert Cole, one of the writers for \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d says he vaguely recalls some discussion of whether to include the lesbian love story. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t some major theme through that we were looking to explore with [those characters] in terms of the story,\u201d Cole clarifies. \u201cWe didn\u2019t like, pull out a full thread of some theme.\u201d\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t Play With Our Emotions: \u201cBlack Panther\u201d and Queer Representation\u2019 [The Root]\n\nBriana Lawrence, who identifies as a queer black woman, was surprised that the scene\u2019s exclusion didn\u2019t bother her. \u201cI should\u2019ve been cursing Ryan Coogler out, swift and fast like my mama taught me when someone pisses me off,\u201d she writes. \u201cBut after thinking it over, I\u2019m happy the scene didn\u2019t make it into the movie, and that feels blasphemous to admit as someone who is always championing representation \u2014 especially for queer folks of color like me.\u201d\n\nHeartwarming Bonus Read: \u2018I Took 7th Graders to See \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d Here\u2019s What They Said.\u2019 [The New York Times]\n\nProf. Kevin Noble Maillard watched the film with a handful of tweens from a Brooklyn public school. A lively post-screening conversation prompted insights like this observation from Jaheim Hedge: \u201cFor people of color, it shows us that we can get through any obstacles that are thrown at us if we work together.

I love you guys.\u201d\n\nSeemingly channeling Earnhardt, who went by the nickname The Intimidator, Dillon bumped the leader Aric Almirola on the last lap, pushing him into the wall before zooming past. Almirola, who had raced in Petty\u2019s No. 43 car last year, fell back all the way to 11th.\n\nAlmirola said he understood.\n\n\u201cIt was the last lap and we\u2019re all trying to win the Daytona 500,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were just racing aggressively.

As he took the interview podium in the media workroom, his mother, Desiree Wallace, ran up and hugged her son as both melted into tears. As the embrace continued for more than a minute, Wallace said to his mother, \u201cYou act like I won the race.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did,\u201d she responded.\n\nBefore the start, Wallace had received well-wishes from the four-time Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton, who, like Wallace, is biracial.\n\nAnd then, minutes before the race, Wallace was told he had an important phone call \u2014 from Hank Aaron, who, like Wallace, was born in Mobile, Ala.\n\n\u201cHe said good luck, and just have a good race,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cHe knew that we were pressed for time. That was cool.\u201d\n\nWallace wiped away tears throughout his post-race news conference, his voice often cracking.\n\n\u201cNo matter what the circumstances are, when you have family here and you run good and it\u2019s been a while since you\u2019ve been somewhat competitive, it pulls on the heartstrings. I\u2019m human.

Wallace had managed to dodge all the wrecks for the whole race \u2014 one of which knocked out Danica Patrick, prematurely ending her final Nascar race \u2014 until the final lap when he got bumped into the wall by Denny Hamlin.\n\nWallace said Petty appeared livid when he first saw him after the race.\n\n\u201cHe walked in and says, \u2018What\u2019s the first thing I told you?\u2019\u201d Wallace recalled. \u201cAnd he has a stern attitude and look. And I\u2019m like, \u2018Umm.\u2019 And he says, \u2018I told you not to wreck the car.\u2019 So we shared a good laugh, and he came and gave me a big hug after that.\u201d\n\nWhile it may have been new faces in the No. 3 and 43 cars, they offered an optimistic outlook for the sport.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really special just knowing that people are tuning in,\u201d Wallace said, \u201cand hopefully noticing the new faces and the new changes that\u2019s coming to Nascar and they\u2019re getting behind it and supporting it.

Alex Bowman, 24, who replaced Earnhardt in the No. 88 car for Hendrick Motorsports, will start the Daytona 500 from the pole position. Elliott and Blaney will be in the second row after winning the qualifying duels Thursday.\n\nOne driver in particular has the potential to do more than anyone to shake up the sport. A graduate of Nascar\u2019s Drive for Diversity program, Darrell Wallace Jr., 24, could give stock car racing something it has never had before: an African-American star.\n\nBut that is not why Richard Petty brought Wallace onto his team. Late last season, Wallace, who goes by the nickname Bubba, got four rides with Richard Petty Motorsports. It was enough for Petty, one of Nascar\u2019s most iconic names, to not only give Wallace a full-time ride, but also to give him his famed No. 43 racecar to drive. Wallace is the first African-American to drive full-time in the top Nascar series since Wendell Scott in 1971.\n\nPetty insisted, though, that he is colorblind when it comes to evaluating talent. Sure, it would be great if Wallace brings the sport into the African-American community, but as far as Petty is concerned, that\u2019s secondary.\n\n\u201cI hope he advances us as a race team,\u201d Petty said in an email. \u201cI care about what Bubba can do behind the wheel for us. The rest, there are a lot of eyes on Bubba, but he\u2019s handling it well. I know come Sunday he\u2019ll be ready to get into a racecar and just show his talent. If he does well, the rest will come and he\u2019ll grow our fan base.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThose eyes on Wallace, much as they were on Tiger Woods a generation ago, prompted Earnhardt to call him last week. The son of racing legend, Earnhardt knows all about the pressure of expectations.\n\n\u201cHe told me that the next few weeks will basically be hell with all the off-the-track stuff,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cBut he said it\u2019ll all be worth it because I have an opportunity to do things outside the sport that not many other drivers will ever say they\u2019ve had that kind of opportunity to do. So embrace it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe child of a white father and a black mother, Wallace said that he does not quite understand why his skin color makes him newsworthy in 2018. But he knows that stock car racing, with its Southern roots and the Confederate flags that still wave from some fans\u2019 campers and cars, has not attracted an African-American audience.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But there\u2019s also venturing out into a different market, into different avenues where the African-American culture lives. We all have to do better at that.\u201d\n\nThere are challenges, of course. On social media, where vulgar epithets can be spewed from faceless and fictitious monikers, Wallace has, at times, had to think twice before responding. He admits he has not always been successful.\n\n\u201cThere is always going to be haters out there, people who don\u2019t want to see you succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that since Day 1 from my parents. Just keep your head down and keep moving, that\u2019s the best you can do.\u201d\n\nBlaney, his closest friend on the circuit, has been around Wallace when offensive remarks have been made.\n\n\u201cThankfully, it\u2019s very, very rare, but it upsets me,\u201d Blaney said. \u201cBubba\u2019s great at handling it. He\u2019s an amazing ambassador for the sport. And he\u2019s really talented and a heck of a competitor. All of us are competitive, but his competitiveness is unlike anyone I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nNascar\u2019s diversity has become an issue again after its only female racer, Danica Patrick, announced she will retire from the circuit after the Daytona 500. But Wallace is not the only driver who can energize an overlooked community. What he can do for an African-American audience, Su\u00e1rez can do for the Latino market.

Credit Chicago Sun-Times, via Associated Press\n\nLerone Bennett Jr., a historian and journalist who wrote extensively on race relations and black history and was a top editor at Ebony magazine for decades, died on Wednesday in Chicago. He was 89.\n\nThe cause was advanced vascular dementia, Ebony said on its website.\n\nMr. Bennett was both lyrical and outspoken in his writing, arguing that the history of black people in the United States had been ignored or told only through a white filter.\n\nHis best-known book was \u201cBefore the Mayflower,\u201d drawn from a series of articles for Ebony and first published in 1962. (Revised editions were still being published decades later.) In it he noted that the first blacks arrived in the colonies in 1619, the year before the Mayflower did, on a ship that reached Jamestown, Va. He wrote of that same arrival in a 1992 article in Ebony.\n\n\u201cNo ship ever called at an American port with a more important cargo,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the hold of that ship, in a manner of speaking, was the whole gorgeous panorama of Black America, was jazz and the spirituals and the black gold that made American capitalism possible. Bird was there and Bigger and King and Malcolm and millions of other Xs and crosses, along with Mahalia singing, Duke Ellington composing, Gwendolyn Brooks rhyming and Michael Jordan slam-dunking.\u201d\n\nImage A later edition of Mr. Bennett\u2019s best-known book. Writing of a ship carrying blacks that arrived in Jamestown, Va., in 1619, he wrote, \u201cNo ship ever called at an American port with a more important cargo.\u201d\n\nMr. Bennett was born on Oct. 17, 1928, in Clarksdale, Miss. His father, a chauffeur, and his mother, a cook, divorced when he was young. He recalled being scolded by one of his grandmothers once when he became distracted on an errand by a newspaper he had found in the street.\n\n\u201cSince I was a child, I was just fascinated by the printed word,\u201d he explained in a 1985 interview with The Miami Herald.\n\nHe grew up in Jackson, Miss., and by 12 was writing for The Mississippi Enterprise, a black newspaper there. After graduating from Lanier High School, he went to Morehouse College, the historically black institution in Atlanta, and was working on the student newspaper when it published some of the early writings of another Morehouse student, Martin Luther King Jr. Mr. Bennett graduated in 1949, the year after King did, and went to work at the black newspaper Atlanta Daily World.\n\nHe moved to Jet magazine in Chicago in 1953 as an associate editor and to Ebony, its sister publication, a year later. He became senior editor there in 1958 and later executive editor. He worked for the magazine into his 80s.\n\n\u201cBefore the Mayflower\u201d established Mr. Bennett as a leading scholarly voice during the racial ferment of the 1960s. In 1966 he testified before a House Education subcommittee looking into racism and unrest, and was blunt, tracing the turmoil of the times to an education system that did not prepare students to live in a multiracial society.\n\nImage Mr. Bennett\u2019s biography of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was originally published in 1964.\n\n\u201cIt is my opinion, and the opinion of many writers and scholars in this field,\u201d he said, \u201cthat segregated textbooks \u2014 and segregated and segregating use of words, symbols and ideas \u2014 are as dangerous to the internal peace of America as segregated schools and residential areas.\u201d\n\nThat was relatively mild compared with what he said about Abraham Lincoln in a January 1968 article in Ebony. Despite his reputation as an emancipator, Mr. Bennett wrote, Lincoln was actually a white supremacist who thought that the races would be better off separated, \u201cpreferably with the Atlantic Ocean or some other large, deep body of water between them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe man\u2019s character, his way with words and his assassination, together with the psychological needs of a racist society, have obscured his contradictions under a mountain of myths,\u201d he added.\n\nIn an interview after the article was published, he stuck to his guns. \u201cLast year, during the riot season, President Johnson said he hoped he would handle himself as Lincoln did during the Civil War,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he does, it will be a disaster.\u201d\n\nMr. Bennett expanded on his argument in 2000 in the book \u201cForced Into Glory: Abraham Lincoln\u2019s White Dream.\u201d The historian James M. McPherson found it a flawed work.\n\n\u201cBennett,\u201d he wrote in reviewing the book in The New York Times, \u201cfails to appreciate the acuity and empathy that enabled Lincoln to transcend his prejudices and to preside over the greatest social revolution in American history.\u201d\n\nMr. Bennett\u2019s other books included \u201cWhat Manner of Man: A Biography of Martin Luther King Jr.\u201d (1964), \u201cBlack Power U.S.A.: The Human Side of Reconstruction, 1867-1877\u201d (1967) and \u201cThe Shaping of Black America\u201d (1975).\n\nIn 1965 he married Gloria Sylvester. She died in 2009. His survivors include their daughters, Joy, Constance and Courtney, and three grandchildren. A son, Lerone III, died in 2013. Mr. Bennett lived in Chicago.\n\nIn an oral history recorded in 2010 for the National Visionary Leadership Project, which collects the stories of notable black Americans, Mr. Bennett talked about a three-part approach to affecting change.\n\n\u201cEvery black person is obligated,\u201d he said, \u201cto try to do what he does as well as any person who ever lived can do it, or any person who ever lives can do it; then, to try to save one \u2014 just one \u2014 person if you can. And then to struggle to destroy a system which is multiplying black victims faster than all the black intellectuals and the black leaders in America can talk about. I see those three things connected.\u201d\n\nOrder Reprints | Today\u2019s Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A 25 of the New York edition with the headline: Lerone Bennett Jr., 89, Historian of Black America And a Top Editor at Ebony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for Breaking News Sign up to receive an email from The New York Times as soon as important news breaks around the world.

Townships have gotten electricity and more modern housing. Government contracts have been set aside for black would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nThese programs have had an impact, improving material conditions and generating jobs.\n\nThey have also been riddled with corruption.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt local governments across South Africa, bureaucrats have abused their authority to steer contracts to companies that put cash in their pockets. At every level of society, people have grown accustomed to kickbacks and political connections determining who prospers, and who goes without.\n\nMr. Zuma\u2019s demise resonates as a sign of a potential new order taking shape. He will forever be linked to his association with the Guptas, three Indian-born brothers who effectively bought key levers of governmental power, amassing influence so comprehensive that it became known as \u201cstate capture.\u201d\n\nHis resignation has raised hopes that South Africa is finally contending with its epidemic of corruption. That view gained momentum when an elite police unit raided a home belonging to the Guptas nearly at the same moment that Mr. Ramaphosa was assuming office.\n\nThe new president is a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle, a former deputy president and chairman of the National Planning Commission, a focal point for thinking about how to engineer economic growth. As a former trade union leader and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Mandela, he enjoys credibility among a range of interest groups, while carrying a reputation as a savvy and strategic operator.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe has had his brushes with controversy, most notably after a 2012 police massacre of striking platinum miners that killed 34 people. At the time, Mr. Ramaphosa occupied a seat on the board of Lonmin, the company that owned the mine. Emails soon surfaced showing that, a day before the police opened fire, Mr. Ramaphosa had been urging senior government officials to take strong action to end the strike.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, no corruption charges have stuck to the new president, who now claims a mandate to clean up the toxic mess left behind by Mr. Zuma.\n\nSome doubt whether the A.N.C. can be salvaged as an effective vehicle for egalitarian policymaking. The party\u2019s executive ranks include many figures implicated in corruption. Mr. Ramaphosa, 65, may champion new initiatives aimed at generating economic growth, yet he finds himself relying on his party brethren to execute his visions, with no certainty that the money will land where intended.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think that taking the president out does much to dismantle the patronage network,\u201d said Ayabonga Cawe, a development economist at Xesibe Holdings, a research and advisory firm in Johannesburg. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need a lot more than taking out the guy at the top.\u201d\n\nAbove all, Mr. Ramaphosa must contend with the structural defects that have long constrained South Africa\u2019s economy, a legacy of apartheid.\n\nBeyond its systemic discrimination against black people, apartheid severed the country from much of the global economy. It ensured that huge numbers of uneducated black South Africans were available at poverty-level wages within major sectors of the economy like mining, agriculture and textiles. That cushioned domestic companies from the pressure to modernize.\n\nPhoto\n\nInternational sanctions isolated South Africa, shielding its firms from competition against multinational rivals. Sanctions also denied South African companies the ability to operate abroad, giving them an incentive to focus on the domestic market. The apartheid-era government obliged with subsidies for favored firms while allowing companies to pursue oligopoly, free of nuisances like antitrust law.\n\nThe result was a system in which large industries, from retail to furniture-making to chemicals, were dominated by huge enterprises whose core strength was the ability to protect themselves against competition. That system has largely prevailed, with smaller companies and start-ups facing often-impossible odds.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cApartheid was a system that lends itself to large conglomerates and concentrations of wealth in the hands of a few,\u201d Mr. Cawe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the corruption. It\u2019s about all of these parallel networks in big business that you need to dismantle. Most of those are white.\u201d\n\nHere is a world that Mr. Ramaphosa knows keenly, having achieved extraordinary affluence by running South African companies with interests in mining, banking, real estate and telecommunications. His fortune has been estimated at $450 million.\n\nIf he is serious about reinvigorating the economy and creating a space for black-owned small businesses, he will need to take on the prevailing structure that made him so wealthy.\n\nHis success on that front may be even more decisive than whether he can tame corruption.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly the most optimistic moment for South Africa in a very long time,\u201d said Mr. Goldin, the former adviser to Mr. Mandela. \u201cIn a way, it does feel like a new beginning.

The aggressive pace of deportations of immigrants of color, the elimination of the DACA program protecting immigrant children and the proposals propounded by the anti-immigration voices in the administration will all have the undeniable effect of slowing the rapid racial diversification of the United States population. Despite this sweeping attempt at racial social engineering, few voices in progressive and Democratic circles are responding with the kinds of outrage that one would expect.\n\nThe pro-white preferences of Donald Trump and his administration, especially when it comes to immigration, are legion. From the day he opened his presidential campaign in 2015 by demonizing Mexicans to the enthusiasm generated by the calls for building a wall along the Mexican border to aggressively ramping up deportations of immigrants of color to eliminating DACA to vulgarly denigrating African nations and Haiti, this administration has been quite clear about its preference for white people.\n\nIt should be no surprise, then, that the immigration policies championed by the White House would all have the effect of reducing the number of people of color coming into the country. A recent study by The Washington Post found that the administration\u2019s proposals to curtail legal immigration by limiting family reunification would slightly delay the date when whites become a minority. \u201cBy greatly slashing the number of Hispanic and black African immigrants entering America, this proposal would reshape the future United States,\u201d the economist Michael Clemens said.\n\n\u201cDecades ahead,\u201d he added, \u201cmany fewer of us would be nonwhite or have nonwhite people in our families.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe administration\u2019s focus is not random.

People of color used to make up 12 percent of the United States population in 1965, and that percentage has more than tripled over the past several decades to the point where nonwhite people are nearly 39 percent of the residents of the United States (it is no accident that the country\u2019s first African-American president was elected when he was elected). Mr. Trump\u2019s team understands that the specific laws it seeks to eliminate have played a significant role in that demographic revolution.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

The very first immigration law passed, the Naturalization Act of 1790, declared that to become a citizen, one had to be a \u201cfree white person.\u201d That demarcation was the explicit law of the land for the next 162 years, until 1952. There are 20th-century Supreme Court cases explicitly holding that Asian immigrants could not become United States citizens because they were not white. Even after 1952, the practical effect of immigration policy continued to promote white people above others through mechanisms such as the Asia Pacific Triangle, which restricted immigration from Asian countries.", "keywords": ["america", "color", "wants", "immigrants", "white", "sign", "population", "nonwhite", "effect", "trump", "states", "immigration", "united"], "polarity": 0.07678771845438513, "subjectivity": 0.2882194965528299},

Almost all of those who led the campaign to bring him to account were black, like Thuli Madonsela, the former public protector, who played a heroic role in exposing Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption. South Africa\u2019s judiciary, which is majority black, defended the independence of the courts with extraordinary courage and under great pressure. After this display of black courage, why would it matter what white people think?\n\nBut South Africa is too fraught and complex a place for such a simple story to ring true. More plausible is that each pinprick penetrating Mr. Zuma\u2019s skin is felt by black South Africans, even those who are horrified by what he has done.\n\nBeneath the surface of public life, one can detect a strange, subliminal to-and-fro. Last year, for instance, a superb book describing in meticulous detail the deep corruption of the late apartheid years, \u201cApartheid Guns and Money,\u201d by Hennie van Vuuren, was a runaway best seller. It deserved to be widely read, but the scale of its success is partly a function of its utility as a weapon against white arrogance. \u201cHowever bad Zuma is,\u201d its many black readers could say to themselves, \u201cyou people were worse.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nTo shrug and say that we are all equally capable of stealing public money is to miss what is distinctive about the mess Mr. Zuma has made. For the truth is that Mr. Zuma and his allies were corrupt partly because they felt a sense of grievance intimately connected to their experience of race.\n\nWhen Mr. Zuma became president of South Africa in 2009, he rallied behind him an alliance of people who felt themselves to be marginal and neglected, not just in relation to the world economic order or white South Africa but also in relation to the A.N.C. itself. The A.N.C. has been run by people drawn from the ranks of an urbane, cosmopolitan elite.\n\nMr. Zuma represented a dramatic change in this tradition. Although he spent years in exile and climbed the ranks of the A.N.C., his biography was unlike any of his predecessors\u2019. Nelson Mandela was born into royalty. Thabo Mbeki was the son of prominent intellectuals. Mr. Zuma\u2019s mother worked in the kitchen of a white family and was too poor to provide her son with a formal education. He grew up herding cattle in the hinterland.\n\nWhen he came to power in 2009, he did so with the support of organizations representing much of the urban working class \u2014 the country\u2019s largest trade union and the South African Communist Party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut he soon dropped these organizations and turned for support to rural South Africa, in particular to traditional leaders and to the elites of far-flung provincial capitals. They carried with them into power an abiding sense of powerlessness, a feeling that the very institutions they now controlled were alien and belonged to others. In office, they believed that they had entered into their enemy\u2019s mansion. It seemed to be payback time.\n\nIn a speech delivered to a room of black businesspeople in December 2016, Mr. Zuma warned of the sophisticated ways in which the enemy confuses black people. One source of such confusion was the prevailing economic orthodoxy. Mr. Zuma suggested that the most fundamental of economic laws was merely nominal; remove the scales from our eyes and we see that so-called economic laws are a ruse invented by the powerful.\n\nHis genre of criminality is light-years from the sort that characterized the apartheid state. The corruption of apartheid\u2019s leaders stemmed from arrogance; they believed that they could control the world forever. Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption stems from the grievances of a man who feels very small.\n\nThis sense of grievance was on display in the last words he uttered publicly as president. In a swipe at his successor, Mr. Ramaphosa, Mr. Zuma suggested that those in the party who had unseated him were \u201cserving the interests of the oppressors of yesteryear, who joyfully celebrate as we lynch one another.\u201d\n\nBlack nationalism in South Africa has many faces. Mr. Ramaphosa represents a strand that is bourgeois, worldly and comfortable with power. There is also a militant, socialist strand of black nationalism, but it is on the wane. And there is the strand represented by Mr. Zuma, who governed as a man shaped and distorted by the violence and oppression of white supremacy.\n\nI am of course alive to the irony of a white South African like me saying that a black president\u2019s corruption was motivated by racial grievance. Many South Africans, black and white, would regard this argument as an excuse for the intolerable. But we should be honest enough to accept that even now, notwithstanding that apartheid has been gone since before nearly half the South African population was born, the legacy of white supremacy has lived on in the man who was president.", "keywords": ["whats", "zuma", "south", "apartheid", "corruption", "white", "distinctive", "mr", "black", "jacob", "zumas", "africa", "mess", "economic"], "polarity": 0.0616115067727971, "subjectivity": 0.37158776707163793},

Evenly lit, crisply photographed, they look like pictures from an illustrated medical dictionary, indexical images of heads, torsos and mouths that are detached from context. Even in a work like \u201cFigure\u201d (1991), the figure in question, sheathed in a black dress and set in the black infinity of no particular place, feels like a fragment, as though she had been extracted from a group photo or a furnished room. The texts accompanying her, eight engraved plastic plaques, read like excerpts from a language primer: \u201cfigured the worst,\u201d \u201che was disfigured,\u201d \u201cfigured there would be no reaction\u201d and so on. Here, not only has the story been winnowed down; it is in fact completely gone. There\u2019s no story. We are left with only the tensions of concrete poetry.\n\nSometime in the mid-1990s, Simpson began to detect clich\u00e9d responses to her work. At the same time, her own thinking was evolving. What does an image of a black woman mean? A commentary on race? An assertion about gender? Simpson branched out from figure-based images and began to experiment more with varied subject matter \u2014 landscapes and inanimate objects like wigs \u2014 and also with unusual quasi-sculptural material like felt and standing screens. A series of monumental multisectional images, several of them landscapes, collectively titled \u201cPublic Sex\u201d (1995-1998) and featuring no figures at all, addressed the provocative title only obliquely. These pictures, made over many years, contain what the scholar and curator Okwui Enwezor calls \u201cthe rumor of the body.\u201d Mysteries of a jagged and deadpan sort, they would go on to influence the noirish tone of Simpson\u2019s later film work.\n\nPhoto\n\nSimpson began to set ever more intricate conceptual layers between her initial inspiration for a work and the finished product. The idea for \u201c9 Props\u201d (1995) began during a residency at the Pilchuck Glass School in Washington. With the aid of artisans at the school, she fabricated a series of dark vessels modeled on vases and other objects used in the portrait work of the pioneering Harlem photographer James Van Der Zee. But these vessels were not the final work. She shipped them back to New York and then photographed them against a plain background. And that still was not the work. Further intervention followed: She turned those photographic images into nine lithographs, which she printed on felt. Finally, she wrote captions below each lithographed vessel, describing the context in which it originally appeared. One of them, for instance, reads:\n\nDinner Party with boxer Harry Wills, 1926 James VanDerZee Harry Wills a k a \u201cThe Black Panther,\u201d boxer, businessman- sits with seven other men and women, mostly women with champagne glasses raised as a woman on his left makes a toast in his honor. There are three bottles of champagne, a crystal decanter, a bottle of port, an arrangement of flowers and fruit, and before each guest an untouched china place setting.\n\nPhoto\n\nFrom multiple directions, the work gestures at what cannot be seen: the original placement of the vessels that inspired Simpson\u2019s own, the people in the photographs by James Van Der Zee, the social life of Harlem evoked by his photographs and the complexity of manners and class implied by them. All that vanished world of culture and experience is reduced to an elegant grid, as simple as an antiquarian\u2019s catalog, a thought picture that demands calm engagement and imaginative intervention on the viewer\u2019s part. Without being representational, it is about race; but race is not off in some category by itself, hemmed in only by questions of skin color, separate from life.\n\n\u201cRepresent!\u201d in the black American sense means standing up for your people, expressing solidarity and letting a shared ethos underwrite your presence and work. It is an exhortation, a greeting and a farewell. The word also has more conventional associations. In the visual arts, it is contrasted with the abstract or the symbolic. To represent, in this more common sense, is to make work that visually corresponds to realities out there in the world: to illustrate uncomplicatedly. This second sense of \u201crepresent\u201d is enjoying a vogue in the art world. Realism is back. This is welcome: after so long an absence of black figures and black faces in art museums, they are now being seen more frequently. Many artists, black and otherwise, are depicting the black body. It is necessary and often successful. Just as often, it fails when it is little more than a clumsy shorthand for socially concerned art, unobjectionable and unimpressive.\n\nA strong appeal of Simpson\u2019s work is that she has always embraced the inherent complexity of blackness, her own blackness as well as the blackness that runs ineluctably through American history. She does not reject representational depictions, but neither does she feel the need to confine herself only to \u201crace\u201d work. When an artist uses a black model, she is presenting a human question by foregrounding a human presence. Is a white man a person while a black woman is and can only be a gendered and racialized subject? As the scholar Kellie Jones has pointed out, nonwhite bodies are often thought of as \u201cnot neutral enough for the dispassionate formulas thought to constitute conceptual practice.\u201d If a black woman\u2019s race and gender are the only things apparent to certain viewers, Simpson seems to say, the ethical responsibility to escape those shackles is the viewer\u2019s.\n\nFreedom is Lorna Simpson\u2019s starting point and her permanent theme. A humane current animates all of her work, a current that neither sidesteps nor confines itself to race. Her work is simultaneously about the \u201cneutral\u201d space of ideas and the particularized experience of the body. \u201cMontage\u201d is photographic and painterly, a riff on a pair of found photographs, sequenced to look like a giant strip of film. It deals with dreams and nightmares, ambiguities and vulnerabilities. At its heart is what Simpson calls \u201cthe push and pull of photography\u201d: the stuttering potential inherent in mechanical reproduction and the imperfect registrations that mirror subconscious life. It is a rapid response to the current political climate, situating a crucial part of it in the most intimate space of all, where the hectoring \u201cthey\u201d is temporarily held at bay in favor of the puzzled \u201cI.\u201d In your own sleeping bed, images persist and words are hard to come by.

To some extent, there\u2019s always been an adversarial role between the White House and reporters. How do you feel about the tenor of things now? It used to be friendly-adversarial. There would be retaliation for stories they didn\u2019t like, but nothing compared with this. There\u2019s a war going on. For a president to come out with the term \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 he\u2019s putting targets on our heads. He has moved the goal posts when it comes to how politicians and people deal with the press.\n\nWhat\u2019s the value of the White House press briefing? Transparency. There is a veil on the White House; people want to look behind the curtain. It\u2019s their house. When you open up a press briefing to see the back and forth, you\u2019re getting more in the weeds of what\u2019s going on, beyond just the quote we may put in the story. This is a key piece that I don\u2019t think people really get: When you talk about the press, it\u2019s not about journalists; it\u2019s about the free-flowing information that the American public is supposed to get. When you bash the press, you\u2019re bashing the idea of getting truth out.\n\nWhat\u2019s the public opinion of the White House press corps? It depends on whom you talk to. We\u2019re so tribal now. There used to be a day when you didn\u2019t know the person\u2019s politics. The line has been obscured between facts and opinion. I think it started during the Clinton years, and it just kept getting progressively worse. People don\u2019t want to just hear the news; they want to hear what people have to say about it too.\n\nYour reactions during the televised briefings have generated memes. Has it made you more self-conscious? I\u2019m so sad about that. My boss has always said, \u201cYou need to know how to play poker.\u201d I don\u2019t. I\u2019m trying! The last time I was really caught off guard was when Sarah Huckabee Sanders said something about people\u2019s minds being in the gutter after President Trump\u2019s tweet about Kirsten Gillibrand. I really get into those briefings. I really try to listen. I don\u2019t play to the camera. I go in there, and I\u2019m really earnest. So when she said that, I was shocked! I was like, No, God, that was a little bit much.\n\nGiven how much you tangle with this particular administration, why do you think you get called on so much? Have you felt like a target? Yes, I have. But I have to shake that off, because I have to go in and do my job. I cover the White House. I cover all issues, particularly those that affect black and brown Americans. Now, what if they didn\u2019t call on me? A certain segment of America would not get the answers to some of their pressing questions. If I don\u2019t ask, who will?\n\nRyan is the White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks and a political analyst for CNN.

You had to ask whether this president believed slavery was wrong. I recently asked him, \u201cAre you a racist?\u201d It\u2019s a sad day when you have to ask a sitting president that. There has been a series of comments or lack of action, from calling Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas\u201d to how he dealt with Charlottesville to his comments on Norway versus Haiti, Africa, El Salvador, black and brown nations. It\u2019s not been one thing. It\u2019s been a pattern. So I asked. He did not answer, which I thought was a wasted moment. He could have put it to rest right then and there and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a racist.\u201d But it took him days to say that.\n\nYou said it seems as if it has changed, going forward, how the White House deals with the press corps and wields its power. What do you think this means for the next president you cover? He\u2019ll clamp down harder on us. Each president has pushed us further away from access. Who knows what will happen or what another president may want? They may not want to be followed. President Obama didn\u2019t like being followed, for example. This president hates us. He\u2019s warring on us.

Just like our kid who\u2019s not white dresses up like Captain America. I think the beautiful thing about comics is they do transcend race in a lot of ways.\u201d\n\nMary Dimacali, 29, a social media and marketing manager in Rockland County, New York, echoed that idea. She does not believe that her fianc\u00e9\u2019s 7-year-old son, Sawyer, who is white, sees the film or its characters through the lens of race. Sawyer himself, during the interview with Ms. Dimacali, said, \u201csure,\u201d when she asked if he\u2019d like to dress up as Black Panther.\n\n\u201cFor a white kid to be so open and judge based on the character\u2019s story and the personality and history, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s important,\u201d she said. \u201cBut on the flip side, I think it\u2019s also great to have a black superhero you can identify and connect to.\u201d\n\nThe character\u2019s history is unique. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1966, Black Panther rules as the king of an African technological utopia known as Wakanda. Untouched by European invaders, Wakanda exists apart from the legacies of colonization and racism. Black history and black fantasy are central to the character, and the series has brought on prominent black writers including Ta-Nehisi Coates to deepen its significance over the last 50 years.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

He is completing \u201cRise of the Black Panther,\u201d a six-part comic series for Marvel that traces the character\u2019s early history. He has tried to explain some of that history to his 7-year-old daughter, but without delving too deeply into complex concepts like Western imperialism, which she may struggle to grasp.\n\n\u201cYou want that white kid to be able to think that he can dress up in a Black Panther costume, because, to that kid, there\u2019s no difference between Captain America and Black Panther,\u201d Mr. Narcisse, 45, said. But, he added, it also involves \u201ctrying to explain what is special about T\u2019Challa and Wakanda without racism.

It\u2019s projected to make a record-breaking $165 million over Presidents\u2019 Day weekend and comparisons to last year\u2019s \u201cWonder Woman\u201d bode well for its reception and impact, particularly for black people.\n\n\u201cWhite people have the privilege of not constantly being reminded of their race in the United States, where white is the majority, whereas as a black person you don\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Vittrup said. She believes that parents in general, and white parents in particular, are reluctant to talk about race with young children. When they do, they often miss the chance to talk about inequality, even though research supports the idea that children develop an awareness of race and difference at a very young age.\n\nMs. Vittrup was careful to add that dressing as Black Panther isn\u2019t inherently appropriative or offensive. The character comes from an invented African country, and to wear his mask isn\u2019t quite the same as wearing blackface. However, in a moment where even more black heroes, like Luke Cage and Black Lightning, are finding their way into the limelight, Black Panther\u2019s relationship with the black community and its history creates an opportunity to teach nonblack children about the black experience.\n\n\u201cKids are not colorblind,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of structural inequality in our society, and kids are noticing that.

Even the clothes are an 18th-century version of current POTUS style: basic black suit and fat tie. As for Washington, he stands blank-faced, one arm extended, like a tenor taking a dignified bow.\n\n[Read remarks from the Obamas and the artists. ]\n\nUninflected dignity was the attitude of choice for well over a century, with a few breaks. In an 1836 portrait, Andrew Jackson, a demonstrative bully, sports a floor-length, red-silk-lined Dracula cloak and a kind of topiary bouffant. (A picture of Jackson, one of President Trump\u2019s populist heroes, hangs in the Oval Office.) Abraham Lincoln, seen in several likenesses, is exceptional for looking as if he may actually have weighty matters on his mind. Most of the portraits that precede and follow his are pure P.R.\n\nThis continues well into the 20th century. In a 1980 painting Jimmy Carter trades a black suit for a beige one. How revolutionary is that? And there\u2019s a Casual Fridays vogue: Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both go tieless for it. Under the circumstances, Elaine de Kooning\u2019s 1963 portrait of John F. Kennedy, a fanfare of green and blue strokes, hits like a boost of adrenaline. Rousing too, though not in a good way, is a big head shot image of Bill Clinton by the artist Chuck Close. Using his signature mosaic-like painting technique, Mr. Close turns the 42nd president into a pixelated clown.\n\nMr. Obama has much better luck with his similarly high-profile portraitist. Mr. Wiley, born in Los Angeles in 1977, gained a following in the early 2000s with his crisp, glossy, life-size paintings of young African-American men dressed in hip-hop styles, but depicted in the old-master manner of European royal portraits. More recently he has expanded his repertoire to include female subjects, as well as models from Brazil, India, Nigeria and Senegal, creating the collective image of a global black aristocracy.\n\nIn an imposingly scaled painting \u2014 just over seven feet tall \u2014 the artist presents Mr. Obama dressed in the regulation black suit and an open-necked white shirt, and seated on a vaguely thronelike chair not so different from the one seen in Stuart\u2019s Washington portrait. But art historical references stop there. So do tonal echoes of past portraits. Whereas Mr. Obama\u2019s predecessors are, to the man, shown expressionless and composed, Mr. Obama sits tensely forward, frowning, elbows on his knees, arms crossed, as if listening hard. No smiles, no Mr. Nice Guy. He\u2019s still troubleshooting, still in the game.\n\nVideo\n\nHis engaged and assertive demeanor contradicts \u2014 and cosmetically corrects \u2014 the impression he often made in office of being philosophically detached from what was going on around him. At some level, all portraits are propaganda, political or personal. And what makes this one distinctive is the personal part. Mr. Wiley has set Mr. Obama against \u2014 really embedded him in \u2014 a bower of what looks like ground cover. From the greenery sprout flowers that have symbolic meaning for the sitter. African blue lilies represent Kenya, his father\u2019s birthplace; jasmine stands for Hawaii, where Mr. Obama himself was born; chrysanthemums, the official flower of Chicago, reference the city where his political career began, and where he met his wife.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMrs. Obama\u2019s choice of Ms. Sherald as an artist was an enterprising one. Ms. Sherald, who was born in Columbus, Ga., in 1973 and lives in Baltimore, is just beginning to move into the national spotlight after putting her career on hold for some years to deal with a family health crisis, and one of her own. (She had a heart transplant at 39.) Production-wise, she and Mr. Wiley operate quite differently. He runs the equivalent of a multinational art factory, with assistants churning out work. Ms. Sherald, who until a few years ago made her living waiting tables, oversees a studio staff of one, herself.\n\nAt the same time, they have much in common. Both focused early on African-American portraiture precisely because it is so little represented in Western art history. And both tend to blend fact and fiction. Mr. Wiley, with photo-realistic precision, casts actual people in fantastically heroic roles. (He modifies his heroizing in the case of Mr. Obama, but it\u2019s still there.) Ms. Sherald also starts with realism, but softens and abstracts it. She gives all her figures gray-toned skin \u2014 a color with ambiguous racial associations \u2014 and reduces bodies to geometric forms silhouetted against single-color fields.\n\nShe shows Mrs. Obama sitting against a field of light blue, wearing a spreading gown. The dress design, by Michelle Smith, is eye-teasingly complicated: mostly white interrupted by black Op Art-ish blips and patches of striped color suggestive of African textiles. The shape of the dress, rising pyramidally upward, mountain-like, feels as if it were the real subject of the portrait. Mrs. Obama\u2019s face forms the composition\u2019s peak, but could be almost anyone\u2019s face, like a model\u2019s face in a fashion spread. To be honest, I was anticipating \u2014 hoping for \u2014 a bolder, more incisive image of the strong-voiced person I imagine this former first lady to be.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m wishing, let me mention something more. Mr. Obama\u2019s portrait will be installed, long-term, among those of his presidential peers, in a dedicated space on the second floor. Mrs. Obama\u2019s will hang in a corridor reserved for temporary displays of new acquisitions \u2014 on the first floor. It will stay there until November, after which there\u2019s no set-aside place for it to land.\n\nIf first men have an acknowledged showcase, first women \u2014 ladies or not \u2014 should too. Better, they should all be together, sharing space, offering a welcoming environment to, among others, a future first female president, and creating a lasting monument to #MeToo.", "keywords": ["portrait", "obama", "fact", "portraits", "ms", "fiction", "politics", "sherald", "mr", "black", "obamas", "washington", "wiley", "blend", "paint"], "polarity": 0.07208600786186993, "subjectivity": 0.35921572042261696},

While it is true that compared with Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton lost ground with that segment of the electorate, the clues to a new Democratic majority may be found in the coalition that elected Mr. Northam governor of Virginia, or perhaps more accurately, voted against Mr. Gillespie and his immigrant bashing.\n\nIn Virginia, polling data has made it clear that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 rhetoric backfired among minority voters as well as, crucially, among many whites. Mr. Northam won a majority of white college-educated voters, who made up a larger share of the electorate in 2017 than they did in 2016. Mr. Gillespie matched Mr. Trump with noncollege whites, but their turnout was down. And minority voters in 2017 matched their 2016 electorate share \u2014 for the first time ever there was no drop-off from the presidential to the gubernatorial election. The Democrats also expanded their margin of victory in Virginia from five percentage points in 2016 to nine points in 2017.\n\nBefore the vote in Virginia, pundits on both the right and left were speculating that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s anti-immigrant strategy was working. But in the end, election results and polling data in Virginia proved all that thinking was wrong. While each state has its own demographics and distinct politics, Virginia has voters who span demographic and economic spectrums. Majorities of voters of all races and ethnicities rejected anti-immigrant stereotypes as ugly and wrong.\n\nAccording to an election eve survey of voters by Latino Decisions, Latino voters said that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads made them less enthusiastic about him, by a 45-point margin. But it wasn\u2019t just Latino voters. By a 23-point margin (52 to 29), whites in Virginia also said the MS-13 ads turned them away from Mr. Gillespie, as did African-American and Asian-American voters by larger margins.\n\nData speaks louder than punditry, and our regression analysis of survey data paints a clear picture. Exposure to Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads actually helped drive white college-educated voters away from the Republicans. When we analyzed findings for white independents and Republicans, voters who were aware of the MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Mr. Gillespie\u2019s Democratic opponent. What should be alarming for Republicans is that this effect wasn\u2019t limited to the governor\u2019s race. The Gillespie campaign had coattail effects, but of the wrong stripe. Across all racial groups, those who were aware of Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Democratic candidates for Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates.\n\nThis means that not only is it morally just for Democrats to position themselves as the party that stands against hatred and bigotry and in favor of inclusiveness and opportunity, but it is also a strategically sound position for winning votes. Simultaneously, it sends a clear, welcoming message to Latino, African-American and Asian-American voters, while also winning over enough of the white voters who also oppose immigrant bashing.\n\nThis phenomenon is particularly true of voters who will decide crucial House and Senate races in 2018: people of color and white college-educated voters \u2014 also known as the Democratic base. Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans are clearly gearing up for a similar anti-immigrant effort in 2018. But now the mask has been pulled off. Voters get it. Democrats have an opportunity to speak out strongly against bigotry. And in doing so, they have a path to victory in 2018 and beyond.", "keywords": ["gillespies", "republicans", "win", "voters", "vote", "white", "democrats", "virginia", "mr", "ads", "ms13", "immigration"], "polarity": 0.10965551203646441, "subjectivity": 0.4705427288760622},

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nYet, despite the obvious truth of that statement, we may wonder: What are the moral and political arguments that underwrite the claim that black lives matter? While there is no way to articulate the full scope of those arguments in a single essay, it\u2019s worth considering the philosophical contributions of some of the forerunners of the movement that is our most urgent manifestation of black thought today.\n\nThe end of the Civil War and the subsequent ratification of the 13th Amendment in 1865 legally abolished slavery, but blacks quickly became subject to a displaced form of violence at the hands of white supremacists across the nation who typically used false accusations of sexual assault to justify lynching black men. Police turned a blind eye to these murders, and sometimes actively facilitated them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIda B. Wells, a leading black thinker and journalist in the late-19th and early 20th centuries, and a co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, built a public career documenting lynchings and calling America to account for them. Her arguments extended and amplified those made by Frederick Douglass before her. Douglass\u2019s central claim in his seminal \u201cThe Meaning of July Fourth for the Negro\u201d was that Americans should feel shame for slavery, given their country\u2019s foundational commitment to liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We were failing our own ideals.\n\nWells pointed to the rise of lynching after the fall of slavery as not merely a legal matter to be rectified with new laws. Having fled her hometown to escape threats of her own lynching, Wells used the press to make her moral arguments. She described a nation in the grip of a dark remorse for freeing black Americans from slavery, and condemned white Americans for cruelties that violated their own commitment to the democratic project.\n\nThe horrors that Wells described were a factor in the Great Migration of blacks to the North, which fed the flourishing of black thought and cultural life that gave rise to the Harlem Renaissance. An indication that the Harlem Renaissance was always meant to be a period of radical black philosophy and social change was the name originally coined for the movement: The New Negro. Alain Locke, the Harvard-educated black intellectual who became known as the father of the Harlem Renaissance, envisioned a philosophical position that reinvigorated blacks\u2019 relationship to their culture and that would in turn solidify their status as equal co-participants in our democracy.\n\nA strong theme among some of the luminaries of the time focused on the will of blacks to assert their humanity against racism and to insist on their status as persons owed respect. Among those stars, the poet Langston Hughes was one of the brightest. His \u201cI Too\u201d is a quiet yet insistent poem depicting a black man employed by a white one and his struggle with invisibility. The protagonist resolves to sit at the table with the white folks the next day and show people how beautiful he is and that he, too, is America. The writer Zora Neale Hurston had an equally persistent but at times more playful take on the matter. In her essay \u201cHow It Feels to Be Colored Me,\u201d she wrote, \u201cSometimes, I feel discriminated against, but it does not make me angry. It merely astonishes me. How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company! It\u2019s beyond me.\u201d\n\nThinkers like Hughes and Hurston were involved in the Harlem Renaissance project of presenting a vision of black cultural vitality and worth that would rework the image of black Americans that whites typically relied upon. That stream of thought runs directly into the heart of Black Lives Matter.\n\nAnother valuable and necessary development to come out of the Black Lives Matter movement is the de-emphasizing of black patriarchy and the equal acknowledgment of the suffering of black women and the black L.G.T.B.Q. community. Though sexuality was an avenue of inquiry during the Harlem Renaissance, it was perhaps the mid- to late-20th century poet and theorist Audre Lorde who did the most to make black women\u2019s sexuality a focal point of political and social philosophy.\n\nWhile today \u201cintersectionality\u201d is bandied about as the cutting edge of social research, it was Lorde who in her writing insisted on complicating our view of personal identity by claiming that each of us belongs to multiple identity communities, all of which contribute to our sense of self and our purposes.\n\nShe also showed the broad reach of white supremacy and its effects on black Americans as they located themselves in more nuanced ways in the tapestry of American culture. For her, the primary form taken by resistance to racism was the denial of blunt categories imposed on black Americans, which stifled the possibility of an individual\u2019s full flourishing. Lorde, then, called for a radical form of self-possession whose boundaries were not open to negotiation with a white society.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen people think of Black Lives Matter, they often think of anger feeding forceful protests. Anger is a reasonable response to racial injustice. To be certain, groups like the Black Panthers and thinkers like Malcolm X advised black Americans to get angry and take the doctrine of armed self-defense seriously. Though anger and love are not mutually exclusive emotions, James Baldwin and Martin Luther King Jr. affirmed a view of civic love to pre-empt the need for violence.\n\nKing espoused a form of Kantian regard that prioritized conceiving of every human, racist or not, as owed a kind of love that is grounded in the ideal of universal respect. Baldwin held a slightly different view. He felt black Americans ought to see whites as democratic kin or family, as people with whom blacks would have serious quarrels but also people whom it would be worth keeping close in order to strengthen and bring integrity to the bonds of shared democratic life. These two views of love eschewed violence yet insisted on militancy. While forgiveness and acceptance were hallmarks of King\u2019s and Baldwin\u2019s views, so was an unyielding commitment to self-respect and the demand for social change to institutionalize the idea that blacks were co-creators of the American kingdom.\n\nThinkers like Wells, Hughes, Hurston, Lorde and Baldwin not only anticipated the current Black Lives Matter movement but provided an intellectual blueprint to give depth and integrity to that slogan, so that its meaning transcends the demand to stop police brutality. It is a demand for whites to extend their historical imagination and recognize that the ills of racism are not the result of a few bad police officers or a few out-and-out racists in some far-off corner of America. The problem, rather, is a kind of complicity \u2014 one partaking in the false comfort that America has somehow escaped the trajectory of its racially murderous history. It is necessary that we to see our society today as continuous with that history and not anomalous to it.\n\nBlack thought\u2019s primary contribution to the academy and to American society is the richness and precision with which it describes our worst demons to us, while offering a vision of how we might each save our democracy from the ruin of irrational fear and hatred.", "keywords": ["showed", "lives", "white", "harlem", "black", "matter", "blacks", "movement", "americans", "america", "renaissance"], "polarity": 0.043612258953168, "subjectivity": 0.3973699190419967},

Bell Pottinger may have set back race relations in South Africa by as much as 10 years.\u201d\n\nWithin days of the firm\u2019s removal from the trade association, clients were fleeing. By the end of September, all 250 employees were laid off and Bell Pottinger was finished.\n\nA Unique Client List\n\nLondon is now home to a cluster of P.R. firms catering to foreign governments, raising worries that the city has become \u201cthe global capital of reputation laundering,\u201d as The Evening Standard put it a few years ago.

He came to fame with the \u201cLabour isn\u2019t working\u201d ads that helped the Conservative Party gain control of Parliament in the 1979 general election.

When the pair started working together in the mid-80s, Mr. Bell was sought after by political leaders and corporations who wanted some of the communications magic he had provided to Mrs. Thatcher.\n\nBell Pottinger quickly had hundreds of clients, a few of them infamous. Mr. Bell attributes his ability to work with virtually anyone to innate optimism.\n\n\u201cI see the good in people,\u201d he said.\n\nThis included Chile\u2019s former dictator Augusto Pinochet. Mr. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain in 1998 as part of an effort to deport him to Spain, where he had been indicted on a charge of torturing Spanish citizens.\n\nAfter two years of legal and political wrangling, Mr. Bell and his allies prevailed when Mr. Pinochet was authorized to freely return to Chile.\n\nBell Pottinger was hardly the only British outfit working for rogues and despots, as well as publicly traded companies, nor was it the largest or most profitable. But it had a buccaneering spirit that made it the firm of choice for a wide variety of missions.\n\n\n\nDuring the war in Iraq, Bell Pottinger had a contract with the Pentagon to produce propaganda for the United States military. This included scripts in Arabic for a soap opera that aired in the country, said Mr. Bell.\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen the company\u2019s client list did not generate news, its methods did. In 2011, it was caught boasting about its skills in the dark arts of search engine manipulation to people it thought were potential clients.\n\nIn fact, they were undercover members of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit organization that works with a variety of media. Posing as executives from the made-up Azimov Group, these \u201crepresentatives\u201d said the company had ties to the Uzbekistan regime, which has been criticized for repression and for using forced child labor during its cotton harvest.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Azimov executives said they worried about blowback.\n\nFret not, said Tim Collins, a Bell Pottinger managing director, per transcripts published by The Independent, a British newspaper. After the company applied its tech wizardry, \u201cYou get to the point where even if they type in \u2018Uzbek child labour\u2019 or \u2018Uzbek human rights violation,\u2019 some of the first results that come up are sites talking about what you guys are doing to address and improve that, not just the critical voices saying how terrible this all is.\u201d\n\nMr. Bell never challenged the transcripts, but he denounced the sting at the time as an \u201cunethical, underhand deception to manufacture a story where none exists.\u201d\n\nBeginning of the End\n\nBell Pottinger\u2019s slide into oblivion began with a visit to the Guptas in January 2016. Mr. Bell, who had worked in South Africa for years, said he had no idea what the brothers wanted, but he and several colleagues flew to Johannesburg to find out.\n\n\u201cWe went to this bloody great mansion, which seemed to be their headquarters,\u201d Mr. Bell recalled. \u201cGreat big room, huge sofas all over the place. Servants. Appalling, all of it.\u201d\n\nThe family already had a fortune, Tony Gupta told the small entourage. Now, he and his brothers wanted to help poor blacks. To that end, they wanted a P.R. campaign that pushed the idea of economic emancipation.\n\n\u201cSo we went back to London and wrote a strategy,\u201d said Mr. Bell. \u201cTown hall meetings, marching in the street, that kind of thing. Draw attention to the economic imbalance, then tell people they should protest and demand change.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe company drafted a two-page proposal, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times. Among its recommendations was \u201ca non-party political narrative around the existence of economic apartheid\u201d that Bell Pottinger would package \u201cinto speeches, news releases, website content, videos/broadcast content, slogans and other material required.\u201d\n\nSoon, the Guptas said that their company needed communications help, too. Most South Africans, the Guptas maintained, had an inflated notion of how much of the family\u2019s revenue came from government contracts, which harmed their interests, several Bell Pottinger employees recalled.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe corporate campaign was the first sign that altruism had little to do with the \u00a3100,000 a month that Bell Pottinger would earn during what was initially a three-month project. The second was the anger of the company\u2019s other South Africa clients when they learned of the arrangement.\n\nThe billionaire Johann Rupert was aghast to suddenly find himself one of the most prominent examples of \u201cwhite monopoly capital.\u201d He texted Mr. Bell and asked how his P.R. firm could also be working for a family that was bashing him. Mr. Bell, by his own account, quickly lost enthusiasm for the Gupta project.\n\n\u201cIt was altogether smelly,\u201d he said of the racial element of the work. But he quickly added that ethics were not the issue. If enough South African clients quit Bell Pottinger, he reasoned, the losses would outweigh the Guptas\u2019s checks. \u201cI was saying it\u2019s not a commercially sensible thing to do.\u201d\n\nBut by the end of March, only one client \u2014 the banking and asset management company Investec \u2014 had severed ties with the P.R. firm. After that, Bell Pottinger tried to find middle ground by signing a new contract with the Guptas, this time with a codicil literally called an anti-embarrassment clause. It allowed the firm to terminate the account \u201cwithout notice\u201d if the brothers brought discredit to the business.\n\nMr. Bell said he soon resolved to quit the company because he felt undermined and undervalued by Mr. Henderson. \u201cHe made my life a misery from start to finish,\u201d said Mr. Bell, speaking one recent afternoon in the living room of his home near London\u2019s Sloane Square. After negotiating a \u00a33.5 million exit package, Mr. Bell resigned in August 2016.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor his part, Mr. Henderson declined in a recent interview to indulge in the put-downs that come so easily to his antagonist. Seated at a conference table in temporary offices in Mayfair, where he is starting a new P.R. firm, he said Bell Pottinger\u2019s dissolution was too recent to discuss.\n\n\u201cI have huge empathy for all those impacted,\u201d he said, \u201cand believe now is not the appropriate time to go into details.\u201d\n\nInflaming Tensions\n\nThe P.R. campaign in South Africa, which started in 2016, was intended to raise the temperature of race relations. And it worked.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore than 100 fake Twitter accounts were created, all of them retweeting content from other Twitter accounts with names like @economycapture, according to media reports. Popular hashtags included #WhiteMonopolyCapital and #RespectGuptas. The campaign involved some 220,000 tweets.\n\nThere were also attack website with names like WMC Leaks and WMC Scams. Another part of this ecosystem were mainstream media outlets owned by the Guptas, like ANN7, a 24-hour news channel, and The New Age, a daily newspaper.\n\nAs the campaign spread, leaders at groups like the A.N.C. Youth League gave inflammatory speeches, decrying the \u201cstranglehold\u201d that rich whites had on the economy. Leaked emails would later show that the groups received media training, and in some cases funds, from Oakbay.\n\nAn atmosphere of menace slowly pervaded the country. In July 2016, the police minister announced the creation of a task force to investigate the murder of more than a dozen political figures. In the run-up to municipal elections that year, Mr. Zuma described the Democratic Alliance, the A.N.C.\u2019s main rival, as a \u201cwhite party,\u201d adding that it could not \u201crun this country no matter how they cover up by getting a few black stooges.\u201d\n\nNew and radical groups like Black First Land First sprang up, holding public rallies to fulminate against whites. At one, in May 2016, a pastor named Xola Skosana told the crowd, \u201cWe have been wounded beyond measure. Let us find the pillars and bring the house down. Black people must be avenged.\u201d\n\nFor the first time in years, whites felt a rising sense of personal danger. Nicholas Wolpe, a white South African whose father was a pioneer of the anti-apartheid movement, remembers a palpable anxiety. \u201cThere was a shift toward intolerance,\u201d he said. \u201cGradually, the debate about white monopoly capital was everywhere and the people talking about it were loud and belligerent. It struck a nerve.\u201d\n\nIn a related and surreptitious campaign, the Guptas were being recast as warmhearted people eager to help the downtrodden. A website connected to Black First Land First ran editorials defending the brothers, suggesting in one that they should be \u201cpraised for saving jobs.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["rogues", "south", "firm", "pottinger", "campaign", "company", "met", "mr", "despots", "pr", "main", "reading", "guptas", "bell", "africa", "end"], "polarity": 0.05728090899659527, "subjectivity": 0.3829289628309236},

The scene never made it into the movie. So, what happened? In a conversation with ScreenCrush\u2019s E. Oliver Whitney, the screenwriter Joe Robert Cole, one of the writers for \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d says he vaguely recalls some discussion of whether to include the lesbian love story. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t some major theme through that we were looking to explore with [those characters] in terms of the story,\u201d Cole clarifies. \u201cWe didn\u2019t like, pull out a full thread of some theme.\u201d\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t Play With Our Emotions: \u201cBlack Panther\u201d and Queer Representation\u2019 [The Root]\n\nBriana Lawrence, who identifies as a queer black woman, was surprised that the scene\u2019s exclusion didn\u2019t bother her. \u201cI should\u2019ve been cursing Ryan Coogler out, swift and fast like my mama taught me when someone pisses me off,\u201d she writes. \u201cBut after thinking it over, I\u2019m happy the scene didn\u2019t make it into the movie, and that feels blasphemous to admit as someone who is always championing representation \u2014 especially for queer folks of color like me.\u201d\n\nHeartwarming Bonus Read: \u2018I Took 7th Graders to See \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d Here\u2019s What They Said.\u2019 [The New York Times]\n\nProf. Kevin Noble Maillard watched the film with a handful of tweens from a Brooklyn public school.

A graduate of Nascar\u2019s Drive for Diversity program, Darrell Wallace Jr., 24, could give stock car racing something it has never had before: an African-American star.\n\nBut that is not why Richard Petty brought Wallace onto his team. Late last season, Wallace, who goes by the nickname Bubba, got four rides with Richard Petty Motorsports. It was enough for Petty, one of Nascar\u2019s most iconic names, to not only give Wallace a full-time ride, but also to give him his famed No. 43 racecar to drive. Wallace is the first African-American to drive full-time in the top Nascar series since Wendell Scott in 1971.\n\nPetty insisted, though, that he is colorblind when it comes to evaluating talent. Sure, it would be great if Wallace brings the sport into the African-American community, but as far as Petty is concerned, that\u2019s secondary.\n\n\u201cI hope he advances us as a race team,\u201d Petty said in an email. \u201cI care about what Bubba can do behind the wheel for us.

He admits he has not always been successful.\n\n\u201cThere is always going to be haters out there, people who don\u2019t want to see you succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that since Day 1 from my parents.

He\u2019s an amazing ambassador for the sport. And he\u2019s really talented and a heck of a competitor.

A native of Monterrey, Mexico, Su\u00e1rez said he had noticed an uptick in social media messages from a variety of Latino countries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually either people who tell me they\u2019re now following the sport because of me, or they\u2019ve been fans and now they have a driver to root for,\u201d said Su\u00e1rez, who is also a graduate of the Drive for Diversity program. \u201cThe potential is huge. This is the most diverse country in the world, but we have to improve diversity in Nascar. If we can make the sport more diverse, we\u2019ll see the same thing with fans.

Townships have gotten electricity and more modern housing. Government contracts have been set aside for black would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nThese programs have had an impact, improving material conditions and generating jobs.\n\nThey have also been riddled with corruption.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt local governments across South Africa, bureaucrats have abused their authority to steer contracts to companies that put cash in their pockets. At every level of society, people have grown accustomed to kickbacks and political connections determining who prospers, and who goes without.\n\nMr. Zuma\u2019s demise resonates as a sign of a potential new order taking shape. He will forever be linked to his association with the Guptas, three Indian-born brothers who effectively bought key levers of governmental power, amassing influence so comprehensive that it became known as \u201cstate capture.\u201d\n\nHis resignation has raised hopes that South Africa is finally contending with its epidemic of corruption. That view gained momentum when an elite police unit raided a home belonging to the Guptas nearly at the same moment that Mr. Ramaphosa was assuming office.\n\nThe new president is a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle, a former deputy president and chairman of the National Planning Commission, a focal point for thinking about how to engineer economic growth. As a former trade union leader and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Mandela, he enjoys credibility among a range of interest groups, while carrying a reputation as a savvy and strategic operator.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe has had his brushes with controversy, most notably after a 2012 police massacre of striking platinum miners that killed 34 people. At the time, Mr. Ramaphosa occupied a seat on the board of Lonmin, the company that owned the mine. Emails soon surfaced showing that, a day before the police opened fire, Mr. Ramaphosa had been urging senior government officials to take strong action to end the strike.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, no corruption charges have stuck to the new president, who now claims a mandate to clean up the toxic mess left behind by Mr. Zuma.\n\nSome doubt whether the A.N.C. can be salvaged as an effective vehicle for egalitarian policymaking. The party\u2019s executive ranks include many figures implicated in corruption. Mr. Ramaphosa, 65, may champion new initiatives aimed at generating economic growth, yet he finds himself relying on his party brethren to execute his visions, with no certainty that the money will land where intended.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think that taking the president out does much to dismantle the patronage network,\u201d said Ayabonga Cawe, a development economist at Xesibe Holdings, a research and advisory firm in Johannesburg. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need a lot more than taking out the guy at the top.\u201d\n\nAbove all, Mr. Ramaphosa must contend with the structural defects that have long constrained South Africa\u2019s economy, a legacy of apartheid.\n\nBeyond its systemic discrimination against black people, apartheid severed the country from much of the global economy. It ensured that huge numbers of uneducated black South Africans were available at poverty-level wages within major sectors of the economy like mining, agriculture and textiles. That cushioned domestic companies from the pressure to modernize.\n\nPhoto\n\nInternational sanctions isolated South Africa, shielding its firms from competition against multinational rivals. Sanctions also denied South African companies the ability to operate abroad, giving them an incentive to focus on the domestic market. The apartheid-era government obliged with subsidies for favored firms while allowing companies to pursue oligopoly, free of nuisances like antitrust law.\n\nThe result was a system in which large industries, from retail to furniture-making to chemicals, were dominated by huge enterprises whose core strength was the ability to protect themselves against competition. That system has largely prevailed, with smaller companies and start-ups facing often-impossible odds.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cApartheid was a system that lends itself to large conglomerates and concentrations of wealth in the hands of a few,\u201d Mr. Cawe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the corruption. It\u2019s about all of these parallel networks in big business that you need to dismantle. Most of those are white.\u201d\n\nHere is a world that Mr. Ramaphosa knows keenly, having achieved extraordinary affluence by running South African companies with interests in mining, banking, real estate and telecommunications. His fortune has been estimated at $450 million.\n\nIf he is serious about reinvigorating the economy and creating a space for black-owned small businesses, he will need to take on the prevailing structure that made him so wealthy.\n\nHis success on that front may be even more decisive than whether he can tame corruption.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly the most optimistic moment for South Africa in a very long time,\u201d said Mr. Goldin, the former adviser to Mr. Mandela. \u201cIn a way, it does feel like a new beginning.

The aggressive pace of deportations of immigrants of color, the elimination of the DACA program protecting immigrant children and the proposals propounded by the anti-immigration voices in the administration will all have the undeniable effect of slowing the rapid racial diversification of the United States population. Despite this sweeping attempt at racial social engineering, few voices in progressive and Democratic circles are responding with the kinds of outrage that one would expect.\n\nThe pro-white preferences of Donald Trump and his administration, especially when it comes to immigration, are legion. From the day he opened his presidential campaign in 2015 by demonizing Mexicans to the enthusiasm generated by the calls for building a wall along the Mexican border to aggressively ramping up deportations of immigrants of color to eliminating DACA to vulgarly denigrating African nations and Haiti, this administration has been quite clear about its preference for white people.\n\nIt should be no surprise, then, that the immigration policies championed by the White House would all have the effect of reducing the number of people of color coming into the country. A recent study by The Washington Post found that the administration\u2019s proposals to curtail legal immigration by limiting family reunification would slightly delay the date when whites become a minority. \u201cBy greatly slashing the number of Hispanic and black African immigrants entering America, this proposal would reshape the future United States,\u201d the economist Michael Clemens said.\n\n\u201cDecades ahead,\u201d he added, \u201cmany fewer of us would be nonwhite or have nonwhite people in our families.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe administration\u2019s focus is not random.

The very first immigration law passed, the Naturalization Act of 1790, declared that to become a citizen, one had to be a \u201cfree white person.\u201d That demarcation was the explicit law of the land for the next 162 years, until 1952. There are 20th-century Supreme Court cases explicitly holding that Asian immigrants could not become United States citizens because they were not white.

South Africa\u2019s judiciary, which is majority black, defended the independence of the courts with extraordinary courage and under great pressure. After this display of black courage, why would it matter what white people think?\n\nBut South Africa is too fraught and complex a place for such a simple story to ring true. More plausible is that each pinprick penetrating Mr. Zuma\u2019s skin is felt by black South Africans, even those who are horrified by what he has done.\n\nBeneath the surface of public life, one can detect a strange, subliminal to-and-fro.

For the truth is that Mr. Zuma and his allies were corrupt partly because they felt a sense of grievance intimately connected to their experience of race.\n\nWhen Mr. Zuma became president of South Africa in 2009, he rallied behind him an alliance of people who felt themselves to be marginal and neglected, not just in relation to the world economic order or white South Africa but also in relation to the A.N.C. itself. The A.N.C. has been run by people drawn from the ranks of an urbane, cosmopolitan elite.\n\nMr. Zuma represented a dramatic change in this tradition. Although he spent years in exile and climbed the ranks of the A.N.C., his biography was unlike any of his predecessors\u2019. Nelson Mandela was born into royalty. Thabo Mbeki was the son of prominent intellectuals. Mr. Zuma\u2019s mother worked in the kitchen of a white family and was too poor to provide her son with a formal education. He grew up herding cattle in the hinterland.\n\nWhen he came to power in 2009, he did so with the support of organizations representing much of the urban working class \u2014 the country\u2019s largest trade union and the South African Communist Party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut he soon dropped these organizations and turned for support to rural South Africa, in particular to traditional leaders and to the elites of far-flung provincial capitals. They carried with them into power an abiding sense of powerlessness, a feeling that the very institutions they now controlled were alien and belonged to others. In office, they believed that they had entered into their enemy\u2019s mansion. It seemed to be payback time.\n\nIn a speech delivered to a room of black businesspeople in December 2016, Mr. Zuma warned of the sophisticated ways in which the enemy confuses black people. One source of such confusion was the prevailing economic orthodoxy. Mr. Zuma suggested that the most fundamental of economic laws was merely nominal; remove the scales from our eyes and we see that so-called economic laws are a ruse invented by the powerful.\n\nHis genre of criminality is light-years from the sort that characterized the apartheid state. The corruption of apartheid\u2019s leaders stemmed from arrogance; they believed that they could control the world forever. Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption stems from the grievances of a man who feels very small.\n\nThis sense of grievance was on display in the last words he uttered publicly as president. In a swipe at his successor, Mr. Ramaphosa, Mr. Zuma suggested that those in the party who had unseated him were \u201cserving the interests of the oppressors of yesteryear, who joyfully celebrate as we lynch one another.\u201d\n\nBlack nationalism in South Africa has many faces. Mr. Ramaphosa represents a strand that is bourgeois, worldly and comfortable with power. There is also a militant, socialist strand of black nationalism, but it is on the wane. And there is the strand represented by Mr. Zuma, who governed as a man shaped and distorted by the violence and oppression of white supremacy.\n\nI am of course alive to the irony of a white South African like me saying that a black president\u2019s corruption was motivated by racial grievance. Many South Africans, black and white, would regard this argument as an excuse for the intolerable. But we should be honest enough to accept that even now, notwithstanding that apartheid has been gone since before nearly half the South African population was born, the legacy of white supremacy has lived on in the man who was president.", "keywords": ["whats", "zuma", "south", "apartheid", "corruption", "white", "distinctive", "mr", "black", "jacob", "zumas", "africa", "mess", "economic"], "polarity": 0.0616115067727971, "subjectivity": 0.37158776707163793},

Evenly lit, crisply photographed, they look like pictures from an illustrated medical dictionary, indexical images of heads, torsos and mouths that are detached from context. Even in a work like \u201cFigure\u201d (1991), the figure in question, sheathed in a black dress and set in the black infinity of no particular place, feels like a fragment, as though she had been extracted from a group photo or a furnished room. The texts accompanying her, eight engraved plastic plaques, read like excerpts from a language primer: \u201cfigured the worst,\u201d \u201che was disfigured,\u201d \u201cfigured there would be no reaction\u201d and so on. Here, not only has the story been winnowed down; it is in fact completely gone. There\u2019s no story. We are left with only the tensions of concrete poetry.\n\nSometime in the mid-1990s, Simpson began to detect clich\u00e9d responses to her work. At the same time, her own thinking was evolving. What does an image of a black woman mean? A commentary on race? An assertion about gender? Simpson branched out from figure-based images and began to experiment more with varied subject matter \u2014 landscapes and inanimate objects like wigs \u2014 and also with unusual quasi-sculptural material like felt and standing screens. A series of monumental multisectional images, several of them landscapes, collectively titled \u201cPublic Sex\u201d (1995-1998) and featuring no figures at all, addressed the provocative title only obliquely. These pictures, made over many years, contain what the scholar and curator Okwui Enwezor calls \u201cthe rumor of the body.\u201d Mysteries of a jagged and deadpan sort, they would go on to influence the noirish tone of Simpson\u2019s later film work.\n\nPhoto\n\nSimpson began to set ever more intricate conceptual layers between her initial inspiration for a work and the finished product. The idea for \u201c9 Props\u201d (1995) began during a residency at the Pilchuck Glass School in Washington. With the aid of artisans at the school, she fabricated a series of dark vessels modeled on vases and other objects used in the portrait work of the pioneering Harlem photographer James Van Der Zee. But these vessels were not the final work. She shipped them back to New York and then photographed them against a plain background. And that still was not the work. Further intervention followed: She turned those photographic images into nine lithographs, which she printed on felt. Finally, she wrote captions below each lithographed vessel, describing the context in which it originally appeared. One of them, for instance, reads:\n\nDinner Party with boxer Harry Wills, 1926 James VanDerZee Harry Wills a k a \u201cThe Black Panther,\u201d boxer, businessman- sits with seven other men and women, mostly women with champagne glasses raised as a woman on his left makes a toast in his honor. There are three bottles of champagne, a crystal decanter, a bottle of port, an arrangement of flowers and fruit, and before each guest an untouched china place setting.\n\nPhoto\n\nFrom multiple directions, the work gestures at what cannot be seen: the original placement of the vessels that inspired Simpson\u2019s own, the people in the photographs by James Van Der Zee, the social life of Harlem evoked by his photographs and the complexity of manners and class implied by them. All that vanished world of culture and experience is reduced to an elegant grid, as simple as an antiquarian\u2019s catalog, a thought picture that demands calm engagement and imaginative intervention on the viewer\u2019s part. Without being representational, it is about race; but race is not off in some category by itself, hemmed in only by questions of skin color, separate from life.\n\n\u201cRepresent!\u201d in the black American sense means standing up for your people, expressing solidarity and letting a shared ethos underwrite your presence and work. It is an exhortation, a greeting and a farewell. The word also has more conventional associations. In the visual arts, it is contrasted with the abstract or the symbolic. To represent, in this more common sense, is to make work that visually corresponds to realities out there in the world: to illustrate uncomplicatedly. This second sense of \u201crepresent\u201d is enjoying a vogue in the art world. Realism is back. This is welcome: after so long an absence of black figures and black faces in art museums, they are now being seen more frequently. Many artists, black and otherwise, are depicting the black body. It is necessary and often successful. Just as often, it fails when it is little more than a clumsy shorthand for socially concerned art, unobjectionable and unimpressive.\n\nA strong appeal of Simpson\u2019s work is that she has always embraced the inherent complexity of blackness, her own blackness as well as the blackness that runs ineluctably through American history. She does not reject representational depictions, but neither does she feel the need to confine herself only to \u201crace\u201d work. When an artist uses a black model, she is presenting a human question by foregrounding a human presence. Is a white man a person while a black woman is and can only be a gendered and racialized subject? As the scholar Kellie Jones has pointed out, nonwhite bodies are often thought of as \u201cnot neutral enough for the dispassionate formulas thought to constitute conceptual practice.\u201d If a black woman\u2019s race and gender are the only things apparent to certain viewers, Simpson seems to say, the ethical responsibility to escape those shackles is the viewer\u2019s.\n\nFreedom is Lorna Simpson\u2019s starting point and her permanent theme. A humane current animates all of her work, a current that neither sidesteps nor confines itself to race. Her work is simultaneously about the \u201cneutral\u201d space of ideas and the particularized experience of the body. \u201cMontage\u201d is photographic and painterly, a riff on a pair of found photographs, sequenced to look like a giant strip of film. It deals with dreams and nightmares, ambiguities and vulnerabilities.

To some extent, there\u2019s always been an adversarial role between the White House and reporters. How do you feel about the tenor of things now? It used to be friendly-adversarial. There would be retaliation for stories they didn\u2019t like, but nothing compared with this. There\u2019s a war going on. For a president to come out with the term \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 he\u2019s putting targets on our heads. He has moved the goal posts when it comes to how politicians and people deal with the press.\n\nWhat\u2019s the value of the White House press briefing? Transparency. There is a veil on the White House; people want to look behind the curtain. It\u2019s their house. When you open up a press briefing to see the back and forth, you\u2019re getting more in the weeds of what\u2019s going on, beyond just the quote we may put in the story. This is a key piece that I don\u2019t think people really get: When you talk about the press, it\u2019s not about journalists; it\u2019s about the free-flowing information that the American public is supposed to get. When you bash the press, you\u2019re bashing the idea of getting truth out.\n\nWhat\u2019s the public opinion of the White House press corps? It depends on whom you talk to. We\u2019re so tribal now. There used to be a day when you didn\u2019t know the person\u2019s politics. The line has been obscured between facts and opinion. I think it started during the Clinton years, and it just kept getting progressively worse. People don\u2019t want to just hear the news; they want to hear what people have to say about it too.\n\nYour reactions during the televised briefings have generated memes. Has it made you more self-conscious? I\u2019m so sad about that. My boss has always said, \u201cYou need to know how to play poker.\u201d I don\u2019t. I\u2019m trying! The last time I was really caught off guard was when Sarah Huckabee Sanders said something about people\u2019s minds being in the gutter after President Trump\u2019s tweet about Kirsten Gillibrand. I really get into those briefings. I really try to listen. I don\u2019t play to the camera. I go in there, and I\u2019m really earnest. So when she said that, I was shocked! I was like, No, God, that was a little bit much.\n\nGiven how much you tangle with this particular administration, why do you think you get called on so much? Have you felt like a target? Yes, I have. But I have to shake that off, because I have to go in and do my job. I cover the White House. I cover all issues, particularly those that affect black and brown Americans. Now, what if they didn\u2019t call on me? A certain segment of America would not get the answers to some of their pressing questions. If I don\u2019t ask, who will?\n\nRyan is the White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks and a political analyst for CNN.

You had to ask whether this president believed slavery was wrong. I recently asked him, \u201cAre you a racist?\u201d It\u2019s a sad day when you have to ask a sitting president that. There has been a series of comments or lack of action, from calling Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas\u201d to how he dealt with Charlottesville to his comments on Norway versus Haiti, Africa, El Salvador, black and brown nations. It\u2019s not been one thing. It\u2019s been a pattern. So I asked. He did not answer, which I thought was a wasted moment. He could have put it to rest right then and there and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a racist.\u201d But it took him days to say that.\n\nYou said it seems as if it has changed, going forward, how the White House deals with the press corps and wields its power. What do you think this means for the next president you cover? He\u2019ll clamp down harder on us. Each president has pushed us further away from access. Who knows what will happen or what another president may want? They may not want to be followed. President Obama didn\u2019t like being followed, for example. This president hates us. He\u2019s warring on us.

Just like our kid who\u2019s not white dresses up like Captain America. I think the beautiful thing about comics is they do transcend race in a lot of ways.\u201d\n\nMary Dimacali, 29, a social media and marketing manager in Rockland County, New York, echoed that idea. She does not believe that her fianc\u00e9\u2019s 7-year-old son, Sawyer, who is white, sees the film or its characters through the lens of race. Sawyer himself, during the interview with Ms. Dimacali, said, \u201csure,\u201d when she asked if he\u2019d like to dress up as Black Panther.\n\n\u201cFor a white kid to be so open and judge based on the character\u2019s story and the personality and history, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s important,\u201d she said. \u201cBut on the flip side, I think it\u2019s also great to have a black superhero you can identify and connect to.\u201d\n\nThe character\u2019s history is unique. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1966, Black Panther rules as the king of an African technological utopia known as Wakanda. Untouched by European invaders, Wakanda exists apart from the legacies of colonization and racism. Black history and black fantasy are central to the character, and the series has brought on prominent black writers including Ta-Nehisi Coates to deepen its significance over the last 50 years.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

He is completing \u201cRise of the Black Panther,\u201d a six-part comic series for Marvel that traces the character\u2019s early history. He has tried to explain some of that history to his 7-year-old daughter, but without delving too deeply into complex concepts like Western imperialism, which she may struggle to grasp.\n\n\u201cYou want that white kid to be able to think that he can dress up in a Black Panther costume, because, to that kid, there\u2019s no difference between Captain America and Black Panther,\u201d Mr. Narcisse, 45, said. But, he added, it also involves \u201ctrying to explain what is special about T\u2019Challa and Wakanda without racism.

It\u2019s projected to make a record-breaking $165 million over Presidents\u2019 Day weekend and comparisons to last year\u2019s \u201cWonder Woman\u201d bode well for its reception and impact, particularly for black people.\n\n\u201cWhite people have the privilege of not constantly being reminded of their race in the United States, where white is the majority, whereas as a black person you don\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Vittrup said. She believes that parents in general, and white parents in particular, are reluctant to talk about race with young children. When they do, they often miss the chance to talk about inequality, even though research supports the idea that children develop an awareness of race and difference at a very young age.\n\nMs. Vittrup was careful to add that dressing as Black Panther isn\u2019t inherently appropriative or offensive. The character comes from an invented African country, and to wear his mask isn\u2019t quite the same as wearing blackface. However, in a moment where even more black heroes, like Luke Cage and Black Lightning, are finding their way into the limelight, Black Panther\u2019s relationship with the black community and its history creates an opportunity to teach nonblack children about the black experience.\n\n\u201cKids are not colorblind,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of structural inequality in our society, and kids are noticing that.

Even the clothes are an 18th-century version of current POTUS style: basic black suit and fat tie. As for Washington, he stands blank-faced, one arm extended, like a tenor taking a dignified bow.\n\n[Read remarks from the Obamas and the artists. ]\n\nUninflected dignity was the attitude of choice for well over a century, with a few breaks. In an 1836 portrait, Andrew Jackson, a demonstrative bully, sports a floor-length, red-silk-lined Dracula cloak and a kind of topiary bouffant. (A picture of Jackson, one of President Trump\u2019s populist heroes, hangs in the Oval Office.) Abraham Lincoln, seen in several likenesses, is exceptional for looking as if he may actually have weighty matters on his mind. Most of the portraits that precede and follow his are pure P.R.\n\nThis continues well into the 20th century. In a 1980 painting Jimmy Carter trades a black suit for a beige one. How revolutionary is that? And there\u2019s a Casual Fridays vogue: Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both go tieless for it. Under the circumstances, Elaine de Kooning\u2019s 1963 portrait of John F. Kennedy, a fanfare of green and blue strokes, hits like a boost of adrenaline. Rousing too, though not in a good way, is a big head shot image of Bill Clinton by the artist Chuck Close. Using his signature mosaic-like painting technique, Mr. Close turns the 42nd president into a pixelated clown.\n\nMr. Obama has much better luck with his similarly high-profile portraitist. Mr. Wiley, born in Los Angeles in 1977, gained a following in the early 2000s with his crisp, glossy, life-size paintings of young African-American men dressed in hip-hop styles, but depicted in the old-master manner of European royal portraits. More recently he has expanded his repertoire to include female subjects, as well as models from Brazil, India, Nigeria and Senegal, creating the collective image of a global black aristocracy.\n\nIn an imposingly scaled painting \u2014 just over seven feet tall \u2014 the artist presents Mr. Obama dressed in the regulation black suit and an open-necked white shirt, and seated on a vaguely thronelike chair not so different from the one seen in Stuart\u2019s Washington portrait. But art historical references stop there. So do tonal echoes of past portraits. Whereas Mr. Obama\u2019s predecessors are, to the man, shown expressionless and composed, Mr. Obama sits tensely forward, frowning, elbows on his knees, arms crossed, as if listening hard. No smiles, no Mr. Nice Guy. He\u2019s still troubleshooting, still in the game.\n\nVideo\n\nHis engaged and assertive demeanor contradicts \u2014 and cosmetically corrects \u2014 the impression he often made in office of being philosophically detached from what was going on around him. At some level, all portraits are propaganda, political or personal. And what makes this one distinctive is the personal part. Mr. Wiley has set Mr. Obama against \u2014 really embedded him in \u2014 a bower of what looks like ground cover. From the greenery sprout flowers that have symbolic meaning for the sitter. African blue lilies represent Kenya, his father\u2019s birthplace; jasmine stands for Hawaii, where Mr. Obama himself was born; chrysanthemums, the official flower of Chicago, reference the city where his political career began, and where he met his wife.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMrs. Obama\u2019s choice of Ms. Sherald as an artist was an enterprising one. Ms. Sherald, who was born in Columbus, Ga., in 1973 and lives in Baltimore, is just beginning to move into the national spotlight after putting her career on hold for some years to deal with a family health crisis, and one of her own. (She had a heart transplant at 39.) Production-wise, she and Mr. Wiley operate quite differently. He runs the equivalent of a multinational art factory, with assistants churning out work. Ms. Sherald, who until a few years ago made her living waiting tables, oversees a studio staff of one, herself.\n\nAt the same time, they have much in common. Both focused early on African-American portraiture precisely because it is so little represented in Western art history. And both tend to blend fact and fiction. Mr. Wiley, with photo-realistic precision, casts actual people in fantastically heroic roles. (He modifies his heroizing in the case of Mr. Obama, but it\u2019s still there.) Ms. Sherald also starts with realism, but softens and abstracts it. She gives all her figures gray-toned skin \u2014 a color with ambiguous racial associations \u2014 and reduces bodies to geometric forms silhouetted against single-color fields.\n\nShe shows Mrs. Obama sitting against a field of light blue, wearing a spreading gown. The dress design, by Michelle Smith, is eye-teasingly complicated: mostly white interrupted by black Op Art-ish blips and patches of striped color suggestive of African textiles. The shape of the dress, rising pyramidally upward, mountain-like, feels as if it were the real subject of the portrait. Mrs. Obama\u2019s face forms the composition\u2019s peak, but could be almost anyone\u2019s face, like a model\u2019s face in a fashion spread. To be honest, I was anticipating \u2014 hoping for \u2014 a bolder, more incisive image of the strong-voiced person I imagine this former first lady to be.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m wishing, let me mention something more. Mr. Obama\u2019s portrait will be installed, long-term, among those of his presidential peers, in a dedicated space on the second floor. Mrs. Obama\u2019s will hang in a corridor reserved for temporary displays of new acquisitions \u2014 on the first floor. It will stay there until November, after which there\u2019s no set-aside place for it to land.\n\nIf first men have an acknowledged showcase, first women \u2014 ladies or not \u2014 should too. Better, they should all be together, sharing space, offering a welcoming environment to, among others, a future first female president, and creating a lasting monument to #MeToo.", "keywords": ["portrait", "obama", "fact", "portraits", "ms", "fiction", "politics", "sherald", "mr", "black", "obamas", "washington", "wiley", "blend", "paint"], "polarity": 0.07208600786186993, "subjectivity": 0.35921572042261696},

While it is true that compared with Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton lost ground with that segment of the electorate, the clues to a new Democratic majority may be found in the coalition that elected Mr. Northam governor of Virginia, or perhaps more accurately, voted against Mr. Gillespie and his immigrant bashing.\n\nIn Virginia, polling data has made it clear that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 rhetoric backfired among minority voters as well as, crucially, among many whites. Mr. Northam won a majority of white college-educated voters, who made up a larger share of the electorate in 2017 than they did in 2016. Mr. Gillespie matched Mr. Trump with noncollege whites, but their turnout was down. And minority voters in 2017 matched their 2016 electorate share \u2014 for the first time ever there was no drop-off from the presidential to the gubernatorial election. The Democrats also expanded their margin of victory in Virginia from five percentage points in 2016 to nine points in 2017.\n\nBefore the vote in Virginia, pundits on both the right and left were speculating that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s anti-immigrant strategy was working. But in the end, election results and polling data in Virginia proved all that thinking was wrong. While each state has its own demographics and distinct politics, Virginia has voters who span demographic and economic spectrums. Majorities of voters of all races and ethnicities rejected anti-immigrant stereotypes as ugly and wrong.\n\nAccording to an election eve survey of voters by Latino Decisions, Latino voters said that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads made them less enthusiastic about him, by a 45-point margin. But it wasn\u2019t just Latino voters. By a 23-point margin (52 to 29), whites in Virginia also said the MS-13 ads turned them away from Mr. Gillespie, as did African-American and Asian-American voters by larger margins.\n\nData speaks louder than punditry, and our regression analysis of survey data paints a clear picture. Exposure to Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads actually helped drive white college-educated voters away from the Republicans. When we analyzed findings for white independents and Republicans, voters who were aware of the MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Mr. Gillespie\u2019s Democratic opponent. What should be alarming for Republicans is that this effect wasn\u2019t limited to the governor\u2019s race. The Gillespie campaign had coattail effects, but of the wrong stripe. Across all racial groups, those who were aware of Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Democratic candidates for Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates.\n\nThis means that not only is it morally just for Democrats to position themselves as the party that stands against hatred and bigotry and in favor of inclusiveness and opportunity, but it is also a strategically sound position for winning votes. Simultaneously, it sends a clear, welcoming message to Latino, African-American and Asian-American voters, while also winning over enough of the white voters who also oppose immigrant bashing.\n\nThis phenomenon is particularly true of voters who will decide crucial House and Senate races in 2018: people of color and white college-educated voters \u2014 also known as the Democratic base. Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans are clearly gearing up for a similar anti-immigrant effort in 2018. But now the mask has been pulled off. Voters get it. Democrats have an opportunity to speak out strongly against bigotry. And in doing so, they have a path to victory in 2018 and beyond.", "keywords": ["gillespies", "republicans", "win", "voters", "vote", "white", "democrats", "virginia", "mr", "ads", "ms13", "immigration"], "polarity": 0.10965551203646441, "subjectivity": 0.4705427288760622},

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nYet, despite the obvious truth of that statement, we may wonder: What are the moral and political arguments that underwrite the claim that black lives matter? While there is no way to articulate the full scope of those arguments in a single essay, it\u2019s worth considering the philosophical contributions of some of the forerunners of the movement that is our most urgent manifestation of black thought today.\n\nThe end of the Civil War and the subsequent ratification of the 13th Amendment in 1865 legally abolished slavery, but blacks quickly became subject to a displaced form of violence at the hands of white supremacists across the nation who typically used false accusations of sexual assault to justify lynching black men. Police turned a blind eye to these murders, and sometimes actively facilitated them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIda B. Wells, a leading black thinker and journalist in the late-19th and early 20th centuries, and a co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, built a public career documenting lynchings and calling America to account for them. Her arguments extended and amplified those made by Frederick Douglass before her. Douglass\u2019s central claim in his seminal \u201cThe Meaning of July Fourth for the Negro\u201d was that Americans should feel shame for slavery, given their country\u2019s foundational commitment to liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We were failing our own ideals.\n\nWells pointed to the rise of lynching after the fall of slavery as not merely a legal matter to be rectified with new laws. Having fled her hometown to escape threats of her own lynching, Wells used the press to make her moral arguments. She described a nation in the grip of a dark remorse for freeing black Americans from slavery, and condemned white Americans for cruelties that violated their own commitment to the democratic project.\n\nThe horrors that Wells described were a factor in the Great Migration of blacks to the North, which fed the flourishing of black thought and cultural life that gave rise to the Harlem Renaissance. An indication that the Harlem Renaissance was always meant to be a period of radical black philosophy and social change was the name originally coined for the movement: The New Negro. Alain Locke, the Harvard-educated black intellectual who became known as the father of the Harlem Renaissance, envisioned a philosophical position that reinvigorated blacks\u2019 relationship to their culture and that would in turn solidify their status as equal co-participants in our democracy.\n\nA strong theme among some of the luminaries of the time focused on the will of blacks to assert their humanity against racism and to insist on their status as persons owed respect. Among those stars, the poet Langston Hughes was one of the brightest. His \u201cI Too\u201d is a quiet yet insistent poem depicting a black man employed by a white one and his struggle with invisibility. The protagonist resolves to sit at the table with the white folks the next day and show people how beautiful he is and that he, too, is America. The writer Zora Neale Hurston had an equally persistent but at times more playful take on the matter. In her essay \u201cHow It Feels to Be Colored Me,\u201d she wrote, \u201cSometimes, I feel discriminated against, but it does not make me angry. It merely astonishes me. How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company! It\u2019s beyond me.\u201d\n\nThinkers like Hughes and Hurston were involved in the Harlem Renaissance project of presenting a vision of black cultural vitality and worth that would rework the image of black Americans that whites typically relied upon. That stream of thought runs directly into the heart of Black Lives Matter.\n\nAnother valuable and necessary development to come out of the Black Lives Matter movement is the de-emphasizing of black patriarchy and the equal acknowledgment of the suffering of black women and the black L.G.T.B.Q. community. Though sexuality was an avenue of inquiry during the Harlem Renaissance, it was perhaps the mid- to late-20th century poet and theorist Audre Lorde who did the most to make black women\u2019s sexuality a focal point of political and social philosophy.\n\nWhile today \u201cintersectionality\u201d is bandied about as the cutting edge of social research, it was Lorde who in her writing insisted on complicating our view of personal identity by claiming that each of us belongs to multiple identity communities, all of which contribute to our sense of self and our purposes.\n\nShe also showed the broad reach of white supremacy and its effects on black Americans as they located themselves in more nuanced ways in the tapestry of American culture. For her, the primary form taken by resistance to racism was the denial of blunt categories imposed on black Americans, which stifled the possibility of an individual\u2019s full flourishing. Lorde, then, called for a radical form of self-possession whose boundaries were not open to negotiation with a white society.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen people think of Black Lives Matter, they often think of anger feeding forceful protests. Anger is a reasonable response to racial injustice. To be certain, groups like the Black Panthers and thinkers like Malcolm X advised black Americans to get angry and take the doctrine of armed self-defense seriously. Though anger and love are not mutually exclusive emotions, James Baldwin and Martin Luther King Jr. affirmed a view of civic love to pre-empt the need for violence.\n\nKing espoused a form of Kantian regard that prioritized conceiving of every human, racist or not, as owed a kind of love that is grounded in the ideal of universal respect. Baldwin held a slightly different view. He felt black Americans ought to see whites as democratic kin or family, as people with whom blacks would have serious quarrels but also people whom it would be worth keeping close in order to strengthen and bring integrity to the bonds of shared democratic life. These two views of love eschewed violence yet insisted on militancy. While forgiveness and acceptance were hallmarks of King\u2019s and Baldwin\u2019s views, so was an unyielding commitment to self-respect and the demand for social change to institutionalize the idea that blacks were co-creators of the American kingdom.\n\nThinkers like Wells, Hughes, Hurston, Lorde and Baldwin not only anticipated the current Black Lives Matter movement but provided an intellectual blueprint to give depth and integrity to that slogan, so that its meaning transcends the demand to stop police brutality. It is a demand for whites to extend their historical imagination and recognize that the ills of racism are not the result of a few bad police officers or a few out-and-out racists in some far-off corner of America. The problem, rather, is a kind of complicity \u2014 one partaking in the false comfort that America has somehow escaped the trajectory of its racially murderous history. It is necessary that we to see our society today as continuous with that history and not anomalous to it.\n\nBlack thought\u2019s primary contribution to the academy and to American society is the richness and precision with which it describes our worst demons to us, while offering a vision of how we might each save our democracy from the ruin of irrational fear and hatred.", "keywords": ["showed", "lives", "white", "harlem", "black", "matter", "blacks", "movement", "americans", "america", "renaissance"], "polarity": 0.043612258953168, "subjectivity": 0.3973699190419967},

Bell Pottinger may have set back race relations in South Africa by as much as 10 years.\u201d\n\nWithin days of the firm\u2019s removal from the trade association, clients were fleeing. By the end of September, all 250 employees were laid off and Bell Pottinger was finished.\n\nA Unique Client List\n\nLondon is now home to a cluster of P.R. firms catering to foreign governments, raising worries that the city has become \u201cthe global capital of reputation laundering,\u201d as The Evening Standard put it a few years ago.

When the pair started working together in the mid-80s, Mr. Bell was sought after by political leaders and corporations who wanted some of the communications magic he had provided to Mrs. Thatcher.\n\nBell Pottinger quickly had hundreds of clients, a few of them infamous. Mr. Bell attributes his ability to work with virtually anyone to innate optimism.\n\n\u201cI see the good in people,\u201d he said.\n\nThis included Chile\u2019s former dictator Augusto Pinochet. Mr. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain in 1998 as part of an effort to deport him to Spain, where he had been indicted on a charge of torturing Spanish citizens.\n\nAfter two years of legal and political wrangling, Mr. Bell and his allies prevailed when Mr. Pinochet was authorized to freely return to Chile.\n\nBell Pottinger was hardly the only British outfit working for rogues and despots, as well as publicly traded companies, nor was it the largest or most profitable. But it had a buccaneering spirit that made it the firm of choice for a wide variety of missions.\n\n\n\nDuring the war in Iraq, Bell Pottinger had a contract with the Pentagon to produce propaganda for the United States military. This included scripts in Arabic for a soap opera that aired in the country, said Mr. Bell.\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen the company\u2019s client list did not generate news, its methods did. In 2011, it was caught boasting about its skills in the dark arts of search engine manipulation to people it thought were potential clients.\n\nIn fact, they were undercover members of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit organization that works with a variety of media. Posing as executives from the made-up Azimov Group, these \u201crepresentatives\u201d said the company had ties to the Uzbekistan regime, which has been criticized for repression and for using forced child labor during its cotton harvest.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Azimov executives said they worried about blowback.\n\nFret not, said Tim Collins, a Bell Pottinger managing director, per transcripts published by The Independent, a British newspaper. After the company applied its tech wizardry, \u201cYou get to the point where even if they type in \u2018Uzbek child labour\u2019 or \u2018Uzbek human rights violation,\u2019 some of the first results that come up are sites talking about what you guys are doing to address and improve that, not just the critical voices saying how terrible this all is.\u201d\n\nMr. Bell never challenged the transcripts, but he denounced the sting at the time as an \u201cunethical, underhand deception to manufacture a story where none exists.\u201d\n\nBeginning of the End\n\nBell Pottinger\u2019s slide into oblivion began with a visit to the Guptas in January 2016. Mr. Bell, who had worked in South Africa for years, said he had no idea what the brothers wanted, but he and several colleagues flew to Johannesburg to find out.\n\n\u201cWe went to this bloody great mansion, which seemed to be their headquarters,\u201d Mr. Bell recalled. \u201cGreat big room, huge sofas all over the place. Servants. Appalling, all of it.\u201d\n\nThe family already had a fortune, Tony Gupta told the small entourage. Now, he and his brothers wanted to help poor blacks. To that end, they wanted a P.R. campaign that pushed the idea of economic emancipation.\n\n\u201cSo we went back to London and wrote a strategy,\u201d said Mr. Bell. \u201cTown hall meetings, marching in the street, that kind of thing. Draw attention to the economic imbalance, then tell people they should protest and demand change.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe company drafted a two-page proposal, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times. Among its recommendations was \u201ca non-party political narrative around the existence of economic apartheid\u201d that Bell Pottinger would package \u201cinto speeches, news releases, website content, videos/broadcast content, slogans and other material required.\u201d\n\nSoon, the Guptas said that their company needed communications help, too. Most South Africans, the Guptas maintained, had an inflated notion of how much of the family\u2019s revenue came from government contracts, which harmed their interests, several Bell Pottinger employees recalled.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe corporate campaign was the first sign that altruism had little to do with the \u00a3100,000 a month that Bell Pottinger would earn during what was initially a three-month project. The second was the anger of the company\u2019s other South Africa clients when they learned of the arrangement.\n\nThe billionaire Johann Rupert was aghast to suddenly find himself one of the most prominent examples of \u201cwhite monopoly capital.\u201d He texted Mr. Bell and asked how his P.R. firm could also be working for a family that was bashing him. Mr. Bell, by his own account, quickly lost enthusiasm for the Gupta project.\n\n\u201cIt was altogether smelly,\u201d he said of the racial element of the work. But he quickly added that ethics were not the issue. If enough South African clients quit Bell Pottinger, he reasoned, the losses would outweigh the Guptas\u2019s checks. \u201cI was saying it\u2019s not a commercially sensible thing to do.\u201d\n\nBut by the end of March, only one client \u2014 the banking and asset management company Investec \u2014 had severed ties with the P.R. firm. After that, Bell Pottinger tried to find middle ground by signing a new contract with the Guptas, this time with a codicil literally called an anti-embarrassment clause. It allowed the firm to terminate the account \u201cwithout notice\u201d if the brothers brought discredit to the business.\n\nMr. Bell said he soon resolved to quit the company because he felt undermined and undervalued by Mr. Henderson. \u201cHe made my life a misery from start to finish,\u201d said Mr. Bell, speaking one recent afternoon in the living room of his home near London\u2019s Sloane Square. After negotiating a \u00a33.5 million exit package, Mr. Bell resigned in August 2016.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor his part, Mr. Henderson declined in a recent interview to indulge in the put-downs that come so easily to his antagonist. Seated at a conference table in temporary offices in Mayfair, where he is starting a new P.R. firm, he said Bell Pottinger\u2019s dissolution was too recent to discuss.\n\n\u201cI have huge empathy for all those impacted,\u201d he said, \u201cand believe now is not the appropriate time to go into details.\u201d\n\nInflaming Tensions\n\nThe P.R. campaign in South Africa, which started in 2016, was intended to raise the temperature of race relations. And it worked.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore than 100 fake Twitter accounts were created, all of them retweeting content from other Twitter accounts with names like @economycapture, according to media reports. Popular hashtags included #WhiteMonopolyCapital and #RespectGuptas. The campaign involved some 220,000 tweets.\n\nThere were also attack website with names like WMC Leaks and WMC Scams. Another part of this ecosystem were mainstream media outlets owned by the Guptas, like ANN7, a 24-hour news channel, and The New Age, a daily newspaper.\n\nAs the campaign spread, leaders at groups like the A.N.C. Youth League gave inflammatory speeches, decrying the \u201cstranglehold\u201d that rich whites had on the economy. Leaked emails would later show that the groups received media training, and in some cases funds, from Oakbay.\n\nAn atmosphere of menace slowly pervaded the country. In July 2016, the police minister announced the creation of a task force to investigate the murder of more than a dozen political figures. In the run-up to municipal elections that year, Mr. Zuma described the Democratic Alliance, the A.N.C.\u2019s main rival, as a \u201cwhite party,\u201d adding that it could not \u201crun this country no matter how they cover up by getting a few black stooges.\u201d\n\nNew and radical groups like Black First Land First sprang up, holding public rallies to fulminate against whites. At one, in May 2016, a pastor named Xola Skosana told the crowd, \u201cWe have been wounded beyond measure. Let us find the pillars and bring the house down. Black people must be avenged.\u201d\n\nFor the first time in years, whites felt a rising sense of personal danger. Nicholas Wolpe, a white South African whose father was a pioneer of the anti-apartheid movement, remembers a palpable anxiety. \u201cThere was a shift toward intolerance,\u201d he said. \u201cGradually, the debate about white monopoly capital was everywhere and the people talking about it were loud and belligerent. It struck a nerve.\u201d\n\nIn a related and surreptitious campaign, the Guptas were being recast as warmhearted people eager to help the downtrodden. A website connected to Black First Land First ran editorials defending the brothers, suggesting in one that they should be \u201cpraised for saving jobs.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["rogues", "south", "firm", "pottinger", "campaign", "company", "met", "mr", "despots", "pr", "main", "reading", "guptas", "bell", "africa", "end"], "polarity": 0.05728090899659527, "subjectivity": 0.3829289628309236}
