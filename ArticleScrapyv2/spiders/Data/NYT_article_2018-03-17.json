But inside the couple\u2019s airy East Village apartment, which smells faintly of Assam tea and glints with eye-catching Indian regional crafts \u2014 miniature caskets inlaid with mother-of-pearl, hand-woven kauna grass baskets, carved wooden spirit masks collected on their travels through Rajasthan, Kerala and Goa \u2014 everything sparkles with light.\n\nShah creates intricate decorations for European and American fashion houses using traditional Indian craftsmanship; she and her mother run the Mumbai-based bespoke embroidery company Aditiany, which produces hand-finished embellishments for the likes of Gucci, Erdem and Alexander McQueen. Honawar, a hotelier and restaurateur, operates, among other properties, the five-bedroom hotel 28 Kothi in Jaipur \u2014 a terraced jewel box of a guesthouse owned by Siddharth Kasliwal, an heir to Jaipur\u2019s legendary jewelry emporium the Gem Palace. In the eight years since the pair started dating, and the two since they were married in Jaipur, Honawar and Shah\u2019s respective creative worlds have become inextricable.\n\nYou have likely already seen Shah\u2019s work, possibly without realizing it. The gold sequin snakes that wound up on the Renaissance-inspired gowns of Gucci\u2019s cruise 2018 collection are the handiwork of Aditiany artisans. Each iridescent sea-foam-green sequin on the shimmering Calvin Klein dress that Lupita Nyong\u2019o wore to the 2016 Met Gala was applied, by hand, at the company\u2019s Mumbai atelier. Shah, who grew up in New York and learned the trade by working with her mother (who founded Aditiany in 1991), helps brands realize their most otherworldly visions, overseeing a 30-person-plus team of fabric buyers and embroiderers in Mumbai and New York. The atelier has helped transform a mohair sweater into a garden of silk trompe-l\u2019oeil roses (Dolce & Gabbana), hand-beaded an entire custom jumpsuit tailored to model Bella Hadid\u2019s body (Alexander Wang) and turned a velvet Saint Laurent smoking jacket into a galaxy of embroidered stars for Keith Richards.\n\nProducing each design requires its own kind of sleight of hand. The 33-year-old Shah splits her time between her studio in Mumbai and New York, where Aditiany has a showroom in the garment district, a storehouse filled with thousands of embroidery swatches: There are yards of gold bullion fringe and Chantilly lace, a rainbow of Murano glass beads and a vast library of brilliant crystals and semiprecious stones. She also makes about four trips a year to Europe to discuss upcoming collections with various houses. The creative process is collaborative: Design teams relay their references for the upcoming season, and Shah then presents samples of embellished fabrics \u2014 \u201920s-\u200bstyle bead-\u200btrimmed lace, fragile Tyrolean-esque flower-stitched silk tulle and new embellishment techniques being developed by the studio in Mumbai, such as embroidery using recycled materials \u2014 that might fulfill those imaginings.\n\nRecently, Honawar began accompanying Shah on her visits to London, Paris and Milan, and joining her at meetings. \u201cAt first, people thought it was bizarre for me to meet [with] all these houses,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I thought it was so interesting to sit there with someone like the head of Gucci or Prada as they tell you what they\u2019re going to do for the next few seasons.\u201d Maintaining a blurred boundary between personal and professional life could make some couples feel claustrophobic, but for Shah, Honawar\u2019s interest is both creatively fulfilling and fun. Building relationships with luxury brands has given the 34-year-old Honawar ideas for new businesses as well, including a forthcoming design studio, a collaboration with his wife that Shah says will offer \u201ceverything from linens to glassware to the perfect towel,\u201d and will highlight the best of Indian artisanal traditions.\n\nLike Shah, Honawar, who was raised in Mumbai, works mainly between India and New York. In addition to co-founding 28 Kothi in Jaipur, the three-outlet gastropub the Woodside Inn and the Pantry, a bakery in Mumbai, he also co-founded Inday, a vegetable-heavy cafe in N.Y.C.\u2019s NoMad district. Along with two new projects in Mumbai \u2014 the recently opened Bombay Vintage, a traditional Indian restaurant, and a still unnamed Southeast Asian restaurant and cocktail bar \u2014 he\u2019s also developing a Puglian-influenced auberge on 60 acres in the Rajasthani countryside. For years, he says, major Indian cities simply didn\u2019t have the kind of dining options you\u2019d find in Paris or London: You ate meals at home, not outside of it. The past decade, however, has changed that: American-born Indians, like his wife, have returned to their parents\u2019 homeland, bringing with them expectations of a truly global restaurant scene.\n\nBut for all Honawar\u2019s contributions to that scene, 28 Kothi, which he designed in 2016 as a respite for the myriad fashion designers, jewelers and photographers who travel through Jaipur, remains one of his favorite projects. The guesthouse\u2019s new cafe will serve elevated vegetarian regional classics such as the traditional rice dish biryani \u2014 which he\u2019s reimagined with spiced quinoa, crisped okra and a sharp-sweet tomato chutney \u2014 or paneer, a firm farmer\u2019s cheese he\u2019s converted into cottage-cheese form and mixed with sprouts grown in the kitchen\u2019s garden. Next, he wants to create a larger hotel \u201cthat exhibits the true India\u201d to the wider world. \u201cIt\u2019s a vast country with diverse culture and history,\u201d he says. \u201cMy idea of modern Indian luxury is preserving that heritage while presenting it to travelers in a language they understand.\u201d\n\nOrder Reprints | Today\u2019s Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page 56 of T Magazine with the headline: Two Worlds Home in\n\n\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["couple", "worlds", "embroidery", "hospitality", "mumbai", "york", "jaipur", "aditiany", "design", "bridging", "indian", "creative", "shah", "honawar"], "polarity": 0.16006065530713418, "subjectivity": 0.5017142481931214},

Credit Joshua Scott\n\nJonathan Anderson\u2019s Craft Odyssey\n\nThe new capsule collection from Loewe\u2019s Jonathan Anderson was born from the same sense of wonder with which the designer once marveled over his grandmother\u2019s hand-knit quilts. For nearly a year, he and his team searched the globe for the best artisans working with fabric, from manjak weavers in southern Senegal to ribbon embroiderers in New Delhi, eventually partnering with over 100 ateliers to create 50 made-to-order tapestries (plus 12 matching tote bags), which will debut at Salone del Mobile in Milan next month.\n\nEach piece tells its own story: A Kyoto-made patchwork (bottom, second from right), for instance, features sashiko, a centuries-old sewing method originally used by Japanese farmers, characterized by \u201clittle stabs\u201d of white thread against indigo-blue cotton. For several other designs, a father-and-son-run workshop with a single loom in Aubusson, France, used a digital pattern generator to reproduce sepia-toned images from Anderson\u2019s collection of found 19th- and early-20th-century photography. (The hand-dyed, multicolored stripe covering three nude figures\u2019 midsections on one of these came from a mother-and-son business in Mumbai.) For Anderson, it\u2019s a celebration of craftsmanship and a reminder that, in our fast-paced world, time may be the greatest luxury. \u201cThere\u2019s this idea that we can consume everything digitally and we don\u2019t pause,\u201d he says. \u201cHow exciting that in the midst of all that, this sort of artistry is still happening today.\u201d Prices upon request. \u2014 JACOBA URIST\n\nImage Credit Anders Ahlgren\n\nHeat Wave\n\nBerbere \u2014 a deep-red spice blend whose recipe, like those for curry and mole, varies from kitchen to kitchen, but typically begins with red pepper, cardamom, fenugreek and ginger \u2014 has long been a staple in Ethiopian cooking. \u201cIt\u2019s what lends the stewed and roasted dishes called wats their distinctive and aromatic heat,\u201d says Sam Saverance, co-owner of Brooklyn\u2019s vegan Bunna Cafe, which serves a red lentil wat (at the center of the platter pictured above) as well as kategna, a berbere and olive oil paste spread over injera (sourdough flatbread). In addition to making berbere-spiced classics, Christopher Roberson of Etete, a contemporary Ethiopian restaurant in Washington, D.C., has lately been experimenting with berbere in other types of dishes, too, as with his popular injera chicken tacos with collard greens and fresh farmer\u2019s cheese.\n\nNow, chefs across the country are following suit, and berbere is popping up in all kinds of cuisines. At Salare, a New American restaurant in Seattle, Edouardo Jordan braises blanched octopus in a sauce with berbere, red wine and crushed tomatoes \u2014 his spin on octopus tagine. \u201cThe complexity just wakes everything up,\u201d he says. Maxcel Hardy, who plans to use lots of berbere (\u201cit\u2019s not a question of if, but how\u201d) at Honey, his Afro-Caribbean restaurant set to open in Detroit later this year, first encountered the ingredient growing up in Miami. Chef Ayesha Nurdjaja, meanwhile, was inspired to recreate a berbere-rubbed chicken kebab for Shuka, Vicki Freeman and Marc Meyer\u2019s new Mediterranean place in New York, after spending a week with an all-male Bedouin tribe in the Moroccan desert. The key, says Ari Bokovza, who recently added a pan-roasted hake with a berbere-laced chickpea ragout to the menu at New York\u2019s Claudette, is to avoid store-bought blends \u2014 his take includes caraway, turmeric and spiced paprika. \u201cIt\u2019s not labor intensive, so why not make it your own?\u201d \u2014 KATIE CHANG\n\nImage Credit Nicolas Matheus\n\nModern Country\n\nNinety minutes east of Lisbon, amid the knotted olive trees and historic farmhouses of Portugal\u2019s Alentejo region, sits the defiantly modernist Villa Extramuros. A Tetris-like assemblage of stone, glass and whitewashed concrete, the five-room bed-and-breakfast, which opened in 2012, was designed by Lisbon-based architect Jodi Fornells and eclectically decorated (Saarinen Tulip chairs, striped wool rugs from nearby Monsaraz) by its owners, Fran\u00e7ois Savatier and Jean-Christophe Lalanne, a French couple. Now, they\u2019ve teamed up with Fornells again to add a pair of free-standing cottages, just down the path (and past the infinity pool) from the main building. The facades of the new structures \u2014 perfect cubes of 500 square feet \u2014 are covered with local cork, and their interiors have been outfitted in a style Savatier calls \u201c\u00e9cologique-pop,\u201d with \u201970s-era brass lamps, handmade Artevida wall tiles, spindly-legged stools by Jasper Morrison and geometric prints by Aur\u00e9lie Nemours. Here, after a breakfast including fresh figs and pasteis de nata delivered right to their door, guests might venture out to the nearby city of \u00c9vora, home to a 13th-century Gothic cathedral and the remnants of a Roman temple. Those returning to the compound in the evening need not worry about getting lost in the groves \u2014 each bungalow has a rectangular neon light affixed to it, one red and the other a gleaming yellow. villa\u200bextramuros.com \u2014 GISELA WILLIAMS\n\nImage Credit Photograph by Charlie Schuck.

But when they do seek out a collaborator, it\u2019s one with both iconoclastic panache and refinement. Case in point: the 83-year-old Parisian industrial designer Marc Berthier, best known for his iconic 1967 plastic child\u2019s desk, the Ozoo. In 2010, Berthier designed the Carr\u00e9 H watch for Herm\u00e8s, which he\u2019s remade in elegant, slightly outsize proportions.\n\nA bold steel square with rounded-off edges \u2014 a Berthier signature \u2014 the timepiece is now 38 mm (the original is 36.5 mm) and slightly curved so it follows the arc of the wrist. A gray dial (it also comes in black) features a crosshatched guilloch\u00e9 center that catches the sun. The numerals, preceded by a zero, are softly brushed with an illuminating finish. The slender second hand comes in yellow or red; a dash of contrast that shows off its creator\u2019s good-natured playfulness. $7,125, hermes.com \u2014 NANCY HASS\n\nImage Credit Nicholas Calcott\n\nA Surrealist Console Table\n\nThe Duluth, Minn.-born, Brooklyn-based artist Misha Kahn cultivates detritus with a vengeance. At 28, he has shown his anarchic, cacophonous work \u2014 including one-of-a-kind furniture that incorporates found objects with weaving, glassblowing and metalwork \u2014 at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and as part of the artist Bjarne Melgaard\u2019s installation at the 2014 Whitney Biennial. For \u201cMidden Heap,\u201d his immersive exhibit last fall at the Friedman Benda gallery in Manhattan, he fashioned giant, otherworldly aquatic creatures out of refuse like plastic bags, shards of glass and a cast-off toilet seat found at the beach in Brooklyn\u2019s Dead Horse Bay. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Kahn likes to hear sound effects \u2014 slurping, squeaks \u2014 while he works. For his latest piece, he\u2019s mated his manic, modern method with the centuries-old tradition of bronze casting. The seven-foot-long console, available in a limited edition of eight, was sparked by the artist\u2019s longtime interest in surrealist animated shorts from the 1930s. With Noguchi-like edges, Boteroesque blobs and Tim Burton-inspired tendrils, the material gives his work a new gravitas, enshrining his joyful lunacy.

She next opened the rustically charming Via Carota in 2014 with her partner and fellow chef Jody Williams (the owner of the nearby French-inflected all-day bar, Buvette) \u2014 a synthesis of their two sensibilities \u2014 and soon, kitty corner, a snack bar called Pisellino. With Sodi, the food always tastes as good as it looks: There is never an object or dish too fussy or pretentious, from the simple-yet-decadent marble backsplash at I Sodi to the beautifully bright, sparsely adorned seasonal greens at Via Carota.\n\nImage Vhernier bracelet, $88,250, (646) 343-9551.

You feel a little more in the party spirit when you have them on.\u201d Whether it\u2019s for a drama like the mid-20th-century Manhattan-set \u201cWar Paint\u201d or a classic Shakespeare play, the 67-year-old Zuber possesses an uncanny ability to create period dress that feels of the time but also dazzlingly modern.

Credit Jason Larkin\n\n\u201cI CAN\u2019T QUITE deal with it,\u201d says Marc Camille Chaimowicz, in considerable understatement, on moving from the London apartment he has spent the past 38 years living and making his art in. The flat is on the top floor of Hayes Court, a 19th-century red brick building in Camberwell, South London, an area long known for having successive waves of artists such as Frank Auerbach and Griselda Pollock. We are sitting in the kitchen, which is filled with appliances from when he first moved in: the 1970s. That was also the era in which Chaimowicz, who is about to have his first solo museum exhibition in the U.S., at the Jewish Museum in New York, began creating his distinct body of cross-disciplinary work, which explores ideas of domestic life through fully realized life-size room installations that he fills with furniture, ceramics, collages, wallpaper, textiles and sculptures, many of which are his own design.\n\nThe influence of Chaimowicz\u2019s work is hard to pinpoint, but everyone familiar with his art agrees that it is substantial. Is it his imagined rooms, so evocatively furnished as to suggest a story? Or his classic drawings, suggestive of abstracted body parts or fractured parentheses that appear on everything from wallpaper to murals to fabric? His persistently joyous sense of color? Most likely, it\u2019s Chaimowicz\u2019s anarchic lack of distinction between public art and private life that makes him a pioneer and also an enigma. \u201cIt\u2019s not that he\u2019s being directly copied by other artists,\u201d says the British contemporary-art writer Louisa Buck. \u201cBut more that Chaimowicz has made a broad swath of practice permissible.\u201d In the post-Pop world of his early career, the idea of calling a lampshade a work of art was sacrilegious; colors such as pastel pink or eau de nil \u2014 signature Chaimowicz hues \u2014 were anathema. Now, the hierarchies between art and ornament have dissolved, and Chaimowicz has emerged, in Buck\u2019s estimation, \u201cas a presiding force over a growing group of artists who are unashamedly playing with d\u00e9cor and environments,\u201d Karen Kilimnik and Lucy McKenzie among them. His 2016 show at the Serpentine Gallery in London encapsulated both the singularity of the artist\u2019s aesthetic and the diversity of his vision: three rooms, each appointed with his colorful retro-futuristic furniture, dreamlike illustrated wallpapers and abstract sculptures made from repurposed items such as vases or jugs or chairs. \u201cChaimowicz has suddenly become an urgent artist in the age of the internet, as boundaries become more porous,\u201d says the Serpentine\u2019s artistic director Hans Ulrich Obrist. Kelly Taxter, curator of the Jewish Museum show, suggests he\u2019s particularly interesting now \u201cbecause the work is in one sense very esoteric and abstract, but it\u2019s also totally approachable. Everyone recognizes a chair and understands wallpaper. So there\u2019s an immediate understanding of his art, coupled with the layers of poetry behind it.\u201d\n\nAll of these layers \u2014 the everyday and the intellectual, the romantic and the rigorous, the domestic and the dramatic \u2014 are present in both the home he is leaving behind and his new one, located just over a mile away in Vauxhall, in a 12-sided free-standing brick-and-concrete building commissioned by Cabinet, the London gallery that represents Chaimowicz as well as Ed Atkins and Lucie Stahl. Designed by the British firm Trevor Horne Architects in collaboration with Cabinet\u2019s artists, the structure\u2019s three lowermost floors serve as the gallery\u2019s showspace; above are two floors of residential apartments, including Chaimowicz\u2019s. He\u2019s contributed to the building\u2019s facade, designing its large, jaggedly geometric windows, set in natural oak frames, an indication of Chaimowicz\u2019s innate inclination to live among his art pieces. Unsurprisingly, the interiors of both the Hayes Court and Cabinet flats keenly resemble his work. Each is constructed almost entirely from his imagination, from the lamps to the drapes to the wallpaper. As more than one curator who has worked with Chaimowicz has pointed out, his installations are Gesamtkunstwerk, or \u201ctotal work of art,\u201d and in Taxter\u2019s view they align the interior of the home with \u201cthe psychological and interior life of the artist.\u201d\n\nImage Chaimowicz\u2019s old flat has a time-warp feeling, thanks to a wealth of early 20th- and midcentury furniture, including these 1930s chairs in the sitting room. Credit Jason Larkin\n\nSpry and dressed in a corduroy jacket, a chevron scarf and a beige trilby, Chaimowicz gives me a tour of his Hayes Court flat, which consists of three humble rooms. The question of what the space will become is on his mind. It must live on in some way, he feels. As a museum dedicated to his work? A short-lived art installation? Its future is still uncertain, reliant perhaps on a benefactor. \u201cIs that a real Warhol?\u201d I ask, trying to stand back in the narrow corridor, papered with a whimsical white-and-gray Chaimowicz-designed pattern, to get a better view of a purple screen print of an electric chair hanging on the wall. \u201cYes,\u201d he replies, with a sidelong smile. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone, will you? It\u2019s quite discreet.\u201d Then he considers the question again, and adds another layer of mischief. \u201cWhat is real?\u201d he asks, rhetorically. He shrugs. \u201cBut it\u2019s a signed edition.\u201d In the room nearest the front door is Chaimowicz\u2019s archive: documentation of his work organized into file boxes, a collection of decorated plates and another of ordinary, bourgeois-colored glass bowls and vases. In the room opposite this one is where he draws, a sunny space with a drafting table and bookshelves dotted with small-scale models and color charts. (When Taxter visited, she discovered there were nearly 100 maquettes of furniture designs \u2014 they were, she says, \u201cintimate and beautiful,\u201d and around half of them are on view at the Jewish Museum.)\n\nThe rest is a faded mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, an \u201cart scene,\u201d as a crime scene bears the traces of a crime. Everything feels like evidence of a life lived, as if the flat has already become a tribute, wonderfully trapped in time. This is in part because the furnishings not created by Chaimowicz are either design classics (by Otto Wagner and Eileen Gray) or simple, almost suburban, midcentury pieces (a \u201950s-era gas stove, red glossy chairs, \u201970s-era beige and salmon carpet). In the bathroom with a forever-dripping tap, the walls above the tub have been painted by Chaimowicz in Matisse-like patterns in his signature sun-faded, candy-colored palette. They are faint, repeated, reminiscent of something \u2014 colors inspired by Bonnard, perhaps, or Marie Laurencin, or textile sketches by Vanessa Bell. In the living room, which is papered in those same shades, a photograph of his previous apartment, a subsidized studio in the East End, where he lived briefly in the mid-70s, hangs on the wall, creating the effect that each of his homes relates to the next like a Russian nesting doll.\n\nImage The artist\u2019s new bedroom, brightened by furniture and a blanket of his own design.

Credit Jason Larkin\n\nTHE FOLLOWING DAY we meet in the new flat, where he is already sleeping, liberated, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the purest pleasure, partly because I\u2019m able to break free from my past.\u201d The walls already bear the mark of his arrival \u2014 he\u2019s left most of them bare and freshly plastered, \u201cwhat the Romans called patina,\u201d he says. At the entrance to the kitchen, he\u2019s covered a door in a purple, pink and orange bamboo stalk-print laminate of his own design. Inside the kitchen, similar patterns are collaged on the wall with many others \u2014 overlaid, clashing, apparently as random as strips of papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9, yet oddly classical in their prettiness. A curtain in his bedroom \u2014 echoing the graphic he recently designed for the cover of the London Underground pocket map \u2014 was made from fabric he designed with a pink, white and yellow chainlike motif. \u201cI\u2019ve declared this flat a white-free space,\u201d he says with a smile, revealing what appears to be a long-held yearning to live and create his art somewhere shiny and new.\n\nIf Chaimowicz\u2019s work is hard to classify, that\u2019s partly because its impact is sensory and indirect, like a mist. Memory, home, reverie, nostalgia, longing: These are all evoked. In a recent exhibition called \u201cTears Shared\u201d at the South London gallery Flat Time House, Chaimowicz showed a collection of jewel-toned glassware. He arranged the pieces against a conservatory wall. When the light caught them, it scattered multicolored rays around the room. In a film, such a sequence of rainbow refractions might be used to summon a childhood memory, or trigger a sunlit meditation. Here, one is meant to simply bask in the cast light and form a story of one\u2019s own. Taxter compares the experience to reading a book: \u201cYou\u2019re reading a story but you and the person next to you have a completely different projection of what the characters sound and look like.\u201d In the installation that launched his career in 1972, \u201cCelebration? Realife,\u201d he filled a former ballroom at Gallery House in London with cheap lights, everyday detritus and found objects \u2014 a scene that looked like the aftermath of an explosion in a dime store or a flea market or a disco. Then he invited viewers into another room to discuss the work over coffee. Also as part of the artwork, Chaimowicz slept in the building at night throughout the period of the exhibition.\n\nThe work that anchors the Jewish Museum show, which opens March 16, is called \u201cHere and There,\u201d and was first installed in 1978 across two rooms at the Hayward Gallery in London. One room evoked a domestic interior (\u201chere\u201d) and the other recreated a more formal gallery-type space (\u201cthere\u201d), with the intent of transferring art from the lived life into the exhibited one. That room contained collages of black-and-white photographs on movable panels. Because Chaimowicz works in a way that is site-specific, each of his shows has its own set of considerations. The iteration of \u201cHere and There\u201d for the Jewish Museum has been conceived because the building was once a home: Its history as a 1908 mansion belonging to the wealthy Warburg family and its ornate interior have become part of the story Chaimowicz has chosen to tell.\n\nImage The facade of the Cabinet gallery building in Vauxhall, for which Chaimowicz imagined the graphic windows. Credit Jason Larkin\n\nHis own story is one he reveals with less ease, and explains, perhaps, why he works in refractions. He was born in postwar Paris, to a Polish father and a French mother. They never spoke about the war. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about that. We never did,\u201d he says, as if his parents were alive and all the family rules still in place. His father, who had a degree in mathematics, got a job at Institut Curie in Paris and later became involved in early electronics. When Chaimowicz, who has two younger sisters, was about 8, the family moved to the U.K. \u201cYou see, my parents were very na\u00efve,\u201d he explains with his sly smile. \u201cThey\u2019d heard that the English education system was very good. They hadn\u2019t heard about the class system.\u201d\n\nChaimowicz, who spoke no English, arrived in the postwar period when the two-tier British education system left pupils that were less academic out in the cold. Armed, at 16, with very few qualifications, he went to Ealing Art College, then to the bohemian Camberwell School of Art, and did a postgraduate degree in painting at the famous Slade School of Fine Art. By the time he arrived, he had burned all of his paintings. He respected theorists and conceptual artists such as Victor Burgin and Gustav Metzger, yet he couldn\u2019t identify with any of them. Sympathetic to emerging currents in feminism, he found that intellectual art world very male. \u201cMy mind was drawn to left-wing ideology,\u201d he recalls. \u201cBut the left-wing practice produced art that I could not enjoy. It was lacking in pleasure, color and sensuality. All the things that matter to me.\u201d\n\nAt Slade, the classical premise that you must suffer for your art was pervasive, but Chaimowicz was having none of it. \u201cThe people I was looking at didn\u2019t seem to have suffered to that extent. Fragonard seemed to have a great time. I thought: I want to be like Fragonard!\u201d After graduation, Chaimowicz was awarded a studio space in East London by Acme, a nonprofit program that partners with London art schools to grant budding artists a subsidized place to create, and he volunteered in a fabric design studio in Lyon. As his interest in the applied arts evolved, his sense of work as an evolution of his life emerged too. Bonnard and Vuillard were a guiding light. \u201cIt was a very rich period in terms of my practice. I\u2019d think: I want some wallpaper but there\u2019s nothing I like and I can\u2019t really afford it anyway. Maybe I could make my own wallpaper,\u201d he says. \u201cI was prioritizing my lifestyle, to the extent that there were complaints about me to the head office. Other artists were walking down the road seeing me on the ground floor of my studio with floral curtains, drinking tea with friends and socializing, and they\u2019d say: \u2018This guy\u2019s not working! He\u2019s fraudulent, he\u2019s wasting precious space!\u2019 \u201d Out of that very transgression, Chaimowicz built a career.\n\nImage Almost everything inside the Cabinet gallery space is custom fit, including the sunburst fluorescent tube lighting on the ceiling.

Credit Jason Larkin\n\nWHEN CHAIMOWICZ GLOSSED over his parents\u2019 part in the war, I thought we\u2019d have to return to that subject somehow. Earlier, he\u2019d told me, apropos of the New York venue, \u201cI have no connection with the Jewish faith whatsoever,\u201d and although I understood the point about his upbringing and his mother\u2019s Catholicism, it seemed to leave part of the story untold. He suggested that we do some of the interview in French, and his childhood seemed a good topic to cover that way. We switched languages. The era and timbre of Chaimowicz\u2019s French is magnificent: rounded, classical, an accent that barely exists in contemporary France. It added a layer of intrigue: His native voice belongs not to a place but to the past.\n\n\u201cI grew up in Montparnasse,\u201d he began. He spoke of envying his sisters\u2019 dolls, and weekends spent in the suburbs with his maternal grandmother, who had warehouses she lent to people who ran flea markets. \u201cI spent every weekend chatting to the stallholders,\u201d Chaimowicz remembered. \u201cIt was wonderful for a boy of 6, 7, 8 years old.\u201d The nostalgia for such things is clearly embedded in his work, which incorporates found domestic objects (like the colored glass). And just when the Proustian reverie seemed about to take off, Chaimowicz said, by way of sudden punctuation: \u201cSo, that\u2019s childhood.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d I said. \u201cYou haven\u2019t spoken about your father.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t spoken about \u2026?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour father.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy father?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nThe equivocation felt, at the time, oddly prolonged.\n\nImage Having remained virtually unchanged since the \u201970s, the Hayes Court flat \u2014 filled with a mixture of Chaimowicz\u2019s work, vintage furniture and \u201950s appliances \u2014 is a work of art, a time capsule and a living space all in one. Credit Jason Larkin\n\nMost of what Chaimowicz told me about his father he preferred not to make public. We spoke about the reasons why \u2014 since an exhibition at the Jewish Museum would seem to precipitate some discussion of a Jewish link. Chaimowicz felt his father had suffered enough; his past had been taboo in his lifetime, and it was only right that it should remain so. Yet in respecting his need to preserve his father\u2019s privacy a point is made sideways: a point about history and identity, about how one can be excluded from groups to which one might be expected to belong; about fear, about memory, about gray areas of belief. And all of this offers some purchase on Chaimowicz\u2019s slippery lifelong subjects: home and remembrance, above all.\n\nChaimowicz\u2019s father was born Jewish but was not religious. His father\u2019s father was one of the founders of the Socialist party in Poland, and anti-Zionist. Chaimowicz p\u00e8re escaped to France and married Chaimowicz\u2019s mother; they brought up their children in the Catholic faith. Once they moved to Britain, the children had French and English culture to manage: They couldn\u2019t cope with a third. The link to Poland was, essentially, erased. Meanwhile, his father\u2019s family disappeared.\n\nChaimowicz suggests that, like many fathers of that era, his was not very present. But there was a moment of rapprochement between them. Chaimowicz was asked to have a show in Warsaw in 1993. He accepted as his father was dying in the hospital. The Warsaw curators wanted to publish one of his sketchbooks in facsimile, and he drew, as a frontispiece, a picture of his father. He\u2019d been to see him in the hospital, and he drew him from memory. He\u2019d never done anything like that before. The resulting resemblance was uncanny. We pause over this. The story makes a much broader sort of sense. His father might once have known him as a boy who could draw, yet memory and intimacy are what Chaimowicz has made his materials. In his hands, even a complicated reminiscence can become something lightly and mysteriously rendered, with the restorative force of a fleeting resurrection.", "keywords": ["flat", "house", "work", "artists", "art", "jewish", "london", "chaimowiczs", "room", "father", "chaimowicz"], "polarity": 0.09543352592747753, "subjectivity": 0.36521759938090576},

Styled by Malina Joseph Gilchrist\n\nFROM RICK OWENS\u2019S ragged T-shirts and canvas shifts to the giddy ornamentation of Alessandro Michele\u2019s Gucci, all glitz and blitz and reconstituted Elton John costumes, the spring collections appeared to not have a common thread between them \u2014 a seemingly bipolar mix of downtrodden, derelict styles and escapist fantasies. Rei Kawakubo\u2019s Boschean excess at Comme des Gar\u00e7ons \u2014 clashing Renaissance paintings and Japanese cartoons as prints and reconstituted pileups of tacky plastic children\u2019s toys as headpieces \u2014 was a stark contrast to Miuccia Prada\u2019s comic-book-print warrior women and the tatty gewgaws and currency-\u200bwar patterns of Demna Gvasalia\u2019s Balenciaga collection. There, the idea of luxury was debased and devalued with gaudy dresses, blouses and skintight pant-boot hybrids cut in post-Brexit-inspired euro-note and dollar-bill patterns.\n\nSo, what is it with fashion at the moment? Designers appear to have assumed a fight-or-flight response to these uncertain times, which, to some \u2014 especially those with a flair for the dramatic \u2014 look a lot like the end of days. \u201cFashion is a reflection of the way we live,\u201d said Gvasalia backstage at Balenciaga. \u201cI wanted to create a feeling that something dangerous was going to happen.\u201d He was talking, specifically, about the sturm-und-drang mood at his show, which took place in a blacked-out venue filled with smoke and the boom of ominous trip hop music. The message was less \u201capocalypse now\u201d and more \u201capocalypse soon.\u201d\n\nArt, literature and film frequently tackle themes of end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it destruction \u2014 in 2017 alone, there was the TV adaptation of Margaret Atwood\u2019s dystopian novel, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d which felt eerily prophetic; Kara Walker\u2019s towering Goya-esque murals shown at New York\u2019s Sikkema Jenkins & Co. in September, which depicted the unfolding of a modern, racially charged civil war; the artist Jonathan Horowitz\u2019s doctored photo of President Trump playing golf while the sky above him burned; and, even, a sequel to that earlier neon-fizzed end-times nightmare, \u201cBlade Runner.\u201d But apocalyptic naysaying is less frequently found in fashion, an industry that trades on optimism, fantasy and, most importantly, an ability to predict the future. But in moments of great distress, even clothing tends to reflect our troubles. Immediately prior to the outbreak of war in 1939, there was a surfeit of Austrian and Bavarian influences in the industry; in the late \u201980s, Black Monday gave way to the rise of a movement dubbed \u201cdeconstruction\u201d that originated with the Belgian designer Martin Margiela, whose leitmotif was the unfinished hem and the inside-out seam. His clothes were purposefully made to look poor \u2014 because the world suddenly was. It was a volte-face to the excess of the early \u201980s, the dancing-on-the-lip-of-the-volcano styles of Christian Lacroix and his archaic indulgences of crinoline pouf skirts and Second Empire extremes.\n\nImage With his two-in-one garments \u2014 a car coat stitched atop a vest; a trench attached to a denim jacket \u2014 Balenciaga designer Demna Gvasalia made a darkly witty reference to the idea of fleeing unrest with just the clothes on your back.

Styled by Malina Joseph Gilchrist\n\nYET THIS SPRING\u2019S fashions, more than in any era in living memory, seem inextricably linked to the times in which we live. They are hysterical, scatterbrained and lunging toward extreme opposites (glittery at Gucci, wasteland-era at Rick Owens) just as global political parties have become more polarized themselves. The collections telegraph post-national, post-history and post-internet ideas \u2014 all of which bear individual examination. The post-national is, perhaps, the easiest to connect to culture\u2019s current fixations: Eschewing borders as various governments seek to enforce them, fashion is, in a sense, evoking an aesthetic idyll, a leftist liberal dream in step with most fashion designers\u2019 sensibilities. The post-nationalism of fashion has emerged perhaps in response to the rise of the right wing \u2014 not only across America, but in much of Europe, too, where the notion of patriotism has been used as a Trojan Horse for prejudice and white supremacy.\n\nEqually, post-nationalism is a reaction to the ongoing furor around perceived cultural appropriation \u2014 when even a hairstyle can cause widespread outrage, as was the case with the dreadlocks worn by models at last spring\u2019s Marc Jacobs show, highlighting the politicization of black women\u2019s hair. Rather than the clich\u00e9d references of early 2000s fashion (and before), where collections could be readily and easily labeled \u201cAfrican,\u201d \u201cAsian\u201d or even \u201cFrench,\u201d the industry\u2019s boundaries have now almost dissolved. Jacobs\u2019s spring collection, for example, was a globalized, turbaned bricolage of different eras and locales, eluding facile categorization \u2014 an eccentric ancient-modern tribe beyond identification, a vision of a nativeless world, with a single culture created from the flotsam of many. And when a designer does flatten their inspiration into the now-old-fashioned adage of X meets Y (Queen Elizabeth plus Duke Ellington, say) it feels hopelessly dated. As for post-history, fashion is oft chastised for its reliance on retro ideas and is encouraged instead to look forward. But what if that outlook is bleak? Fashion\u2019s current point of view is hesitant, reluctant even, to think too much about the future.\n\nAs the line between true and false and right and wrong becomes disorientingly blurred, designers are challenging other norms \u2014 including the purpose of clothing itself. Mutated hybrids are emerging, the most extreme being Balenciaga\u2019s propositions of entirely separate garments \u2014 like denim jackets and trenches or opera coats and padded construction worker\u2019s vests \u2014 conjoined at the neck, leaving one or the other flapping over the front or flank, or Phoebe Philo\u2019s two-in-one trench coats for C\u00e9line, which are sewn together in an infinity loop at the bottom hem.\n\nAt Maison Margiela, John Galliano sliced his clothes apart with a technique he dubs \u201cd\u00e9cortiqu\u00e9\u201d (translation: \u201cpeeled\u201d or \u201cshelled\u201d), stripping the garment to a framework of ribbony seam allowance, with open space between. The concept rethinks a jacket\u2019s reason for being: It will no longer protect you from the elements, a previously essential component of a garment, that could, perhaps, become unnecessary due to the ever-rising mercury of climate change. Rick Owens\u2019s spring show had swollen, bulbous volumes erupting from various points on the torso, which, he said, scrambled familiar bodily shapes. Most everything he showed featured zipped pockets, transforming a piece of clothing into something more akin to a suit fit for a nomadic post-apocalyptic existence, an outfit for a world in which not only the idea of nation had become irrelevant, but that of home as well. With nowhere to store your belongings, you had to carry them with you.\n\nImage Rick Owens\u2019s protective, body-obscuring, heavily padded garments recalled tents, turtle shells and rucksacks: clothing for an era in which home is whatever you can carry with you.

Styled by Malina Joseph Gilchrist\n\nWalter Bradford Cannon, the physiologist who first coined the term \u201cfight or flight,\u201d observed that fear was the motivation for the latter and rage for the former \u2014 although both could be triggered by the same event. That seems to be the instinct of designers, too, caught (as are all of us) between fear for survival (of humanity, of themselves, or maybe just of their business) and raging against the machine. Rick Owens characterized his show as \u201ca gesture of turning away from threat, not really as escapism, but as rejection.\u201d Others were rather more fantastic \u2014 Alessandro Michele\u2019s Milanese Gucci show, for instance, with its gang of rootless rebels in glittering neo-folkloric dress traipsing a runway reimagined as a fabulist map of artifacts from the ancient world. (In reality, they were fakes shipped from the Cinecitt\u00e0 film studios in Rome.) Fight or flight, or fatalist versus fabulist, is the season\u2019s key message.\n\nBut how can you run from \u2014 or fight \u2014 an apocalypse? Apocalypse evokes the notion of worlds falling apart in spectacular, high Hollywood fashion \u2014 a flood, an asteroid, and existence being wiped out. Judgment Day. But perhaps the apocalypse we are approaching is, to a degree, a destruction of worlds rather than the world, a collapsing of established orders and ways of doing business. On a base, commercial level, the old rules of seasons and of male and female suddenly seem inapplicable, irrelevant \u2014 fashion labels are challenging gender binaries, eschewing retrospective styles, cultural cherry-picking and lazy luxury for something more fluid and less easily categorized.\n\nOwens cited the Italian poet and activist Filippo Tommaso Marinetti\u2019s \u201cManifesto of Futurism,\u201d written in 1909, as an inspiration for his show. \u201cThere are a few unfortunate attitudes in this manifesto regarding women and book burning,\u201d he said with his typical deadpan candor. \u201cBut what\u2019s fascinating about radical utopian movements is that they start with the best intentions but then degenerate and crumble. Until the next wave of hope appears over the horizon.\u201d\n\nModel: Achok at DNA Model Management. Hair by Adam Szabo at Frank Reps using Oribe.

Two centuries ago, the French led a shift from free-form cooking to codified techniques and built a system for achieving and recognizing mastery that still defines the professional kitchen, pastry or otherwise. So inevitably it\u2019s the croissant that\u2019s seen as being in danger of degradation: the noble, labor-intensive French pastry sullied by its union with the crude, arriviste American doughnut or muffin. (Another iteration was unveiled in January by Vive la Tarte in San Francisco: the tacro, a savory pork- or chicken-stuffed taco with a croissant shell.)\n\nPhoto\n\nYET THE CROISSANT itself was born of crossed borders. The butter-laden layered dough has roots in medieval Arab practice, and the pastry\u2019s shape comes from the Viennese kipferl, said to have been modeled after the Islamic crescent borne on the banners of 17th-century Ottoman invaders. (Although this back story is likely apocryphal, in 2013 a rebel stronghold in Syria banned croissants as symbols of colonialism.) Few dishes, let alone desserts, have remained static over time: Blancmange, a molded milk pudding, was once a chicken casserole; craggy coconut Italian-Jewish macaroons share ancestry (going back to early Sicilian pasta) with the polished round French macarons that have ruffled hems, which languished as solitary disks until someone sandwiched them around ganache a little over a century ago.\n\nIf anything, today\u2019s nouvelle pastries mark a return to the spirit championed by Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame, the early 19th-century forefather of French cooking, inventor of the souffl\u00e9 and the croquembouche and architect of monumental confectionery centerpieces that rose up to three feet \u2014 nearly as high as the sculptured hairstyles of his late namesake, Marie Antoinette, the Austrian princess whose own love for viennoiserie may have inspired the myth of her declaring, \u201cLet them eat cake.\u201d Car\u00eame has disciples in Paris today, including Christophe Adam, known for \u00e9clairs ornamented with edible silver, popcorn and Mona Lisa eyes; Jonathan Blot, conjurer of macarons that taste like bubble gum; and, of course, Pierre Herm\u00e9, who daubs raspberry-lychee p\u00e2t\u00e9 inside croissants and showers them with candied rose petals. Like the original viennoiserie, which were painstakingly elegant pastries designed for the Hapsburg court in imperial Vienna that eventually became indispensable to the city\u2019s sidewalks, their decadence is matched by the virtuosity of their construction and their element of surprise: They are, then as now, as much for beholding as for eating.\n\nTheir contemporary allure is aided by the diminishment of desserts at midrange restaurants, which after the recession of 2008 began to shed pastry chefs, unable to justify the expense for a course that yields little profit. As restaurant desserts have become simpler and homier \u2014 olive-oil cake, anything with chocolate \u2014 once plainspoken baked goods have turned rococo, offering an aura of luxury, enhanced by how difficult they are to procure before selling out each morning. At $4 to $8 each, these small but elaborate edifices seem worthier than the run-of-the-mill pastries available at every urban corner deli and curbside coffee cart, enabling their artisans to cover the ever-increasing cost of basic ingredients, particularly butter, whose price hit a historic high last year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIndeed, French butter, which has a higher percentage of fat and a pronounced tang from cultured cream, is so desirable across the globe, it\u2019s starting to disappear from grocery shelves in France. This is partly because more people are making pastries than ever before; as a French professor explained to The Economist in November, \u201cChina has discovered croissants.\u201d But if the trend continues, the croissant as we know it \u2014 a straightforward compact of butter, flour, milk, sugar, yeast and salt \u2014 may be no more. And in its place? These overgrown crescents too big to fit in the palm of the hand, spangled and swagged, glutted with fillings, arrayed like objets d\u2019art in austere concrete-walled patisseries where the bakers fuss like apothecaries. They\u2019re absurd until you try them: salty and sweet and shattering everywhere, leaving behind smears of cream and telltale butter fingerprints.

Moss and Getchell recently left New York and moved into a 1929 colonial revival house in a small Connecticut town. From there, they run a design and retail consulting firm, and on April 10 they will release a Rizzoli book reflecting on the impact of the Moss store. To mark the occasion, T sent Moss a Polaroid camera and asked him to photograph some of the many objects that decorate his home.\n\n\u201cThese photos were all taken on the morning of March 1,\u201d Moss explains of his images, below. Every morning he rises at around 4 a.m. and, after making tea, surveys and rearranges his objects \u2014 crystal glasses, a Nymphenburg porcelain bird. It\u2019s an activity born of both love and habit, he says. \u201cI always enjoyed doing this when we had the store and galleries \u2014 and I still do it, although it\u2019s now at home, and on a much smaller scale.\u201d\n\nImage Credit Murray Moss\n\nThe first cupboard I open each morning is the one with our Victorian china teapot in it.\n\nImage Credit Murray Moss\n\nOne of the niches for books that is built into a long wall in the living room, paneled with knotty alder wood.

During its reign, his namesake shop-cum-gallery in SoHo, which opened in 1994 and closed in 2012, defined avant-garde good taste. Moss blurred the lines between art and design and reinvented visual merchandising, displaying everything from an 18th-century Nymphenburg figurine to a kaleidoscopic array of Maarten Baas Clay chairs inside massive vitrines within the immaculate white space. After almost 50 years in Manhattan, the 68-year-old, who now runs his own design and retail consulting firm, moved to a traditional clapboard house in Connecticut last year with his partner in life and business, Franklin Getchell, with whom he has also co-authored a new Rizzoli book, out this April, documenting the cultural influence of the Moss store.

{"title": "\n                    The Women Responsible for the Look of Your Next All-Day Cafe                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/12/t-magazine/design/mp-shift-anna-polonsky-amy-morris.html", "text": "Photo\n\nON A FALL afternoon at De Maria, a year-old restaurant in New York\u2019s NoLIta neighborhood, the flat city light pours in from a wall of windows onto square tables covered in worn pistachio-green and navy leather. Diners can sit on squat wooden chairs, a tan-leather banquette or felt-topped stools at the bar, which is lit by orblike pendants and backed by a Bauhaus-via-Brazil geometric tile mural. They might order a chai latte, which arrives in a stoneware mug made by Brooklyn\u2019s Workaday Handmade, or a cured-salmon and coconut grain bowl, off seasonal menus that are available from early in the morning until late at night.\n\nBeyond the virtuous food, the space itself is somehow salubrious, as if solely by being here you are improving your life. Along with places like Kismet in Los Angeles, June\u2019s All Day in Austin and Res Ipsa in Philadelphia, De Maria is part of a new class of American restaurants \u2014 or rather, \u201call-day cafes\u201d \u2014 that combine highly specific, instantly recognizable d\u00e9cor with visually pleasing riffs on health-store classics like flaxseed banana bread and acai. These new cafes, all of which owe a debt to New York\u2019s abstemious Dimes, which opened in Chinatown in 2013, present amiable aesthetic experiences that feel ready-made for Instagram: Many of these rooms share the same natural light, blond wood chairs and copper details that have come to evoke a kind of Scandinavian-inflected, aspirational millennial apartment, which the cafes themselves tend to resemble.\n\nDe Maria\u2019s interior, in particular, is the work of the MP Shift, a Chinatown-based design and branding studio that, since its founding three years ago, has created variations on this look for several New York City restaurants and is now expanding throughout the country \u2014 as well as to Paris, London and Sydney. The studio was established by Amy Morris and Anna Polonsky (the M and P of the name, plus shift as in \u201clate\u201d), who met a decade ago through mutual friends, when Morris was a marketing consultant and Polonsky was a managing partner at a culinary events company. The young chefs and restaurateurs they encountered in those jobs were often interested in developing independent projects but lacked the proper guidance, so the two women decided to build an agency that consolidated graphics, interiors and brand-direction.\n\nIf it\u2019s well established that we eat with our eyes, then the MP Shift is selling a related truth: In our digital age, a restaurant\u2019s interior must be as satiating as its food. Officially, Morris and Polonsky have little to do with what\u2019s on a client\u2019s menu (aside from its logo, typefaces and layout), but they have tended to partner with chefs who prefer serving things like cerulean spirulina smoothies and magenta-hued radicchio salads that feel intended for future snapshots. The plating, too, reflects an understanding of what appeals to these restaurants\u2019 intended psychographic: It\u2019s heavy on swooshes of creamy sauces and bright, clashing layers of tropical fruits or local vegetables in flattened, de Kooning-esque compositions, often rendered atop wide, shallow clay plates and bowls. The MP Shift doesn\u2019t tell the kitchen staff how to assemble their ingredients, but they don\u2019t need to; chefs these days must think as much like designers as they do cooks \u2014 indeed, their success depends upon it.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat the MP Shift does do is help ensure that this all-day fare remains visually appealing no matter the hour, while also providing a growing community of urban freelancers a sort of idealized living-room-as-office, allowing a public space to masquerade as a private one. \u201cIn the morning, everyone is on their laptop here; people are spending more time in restaurants as their third space,\u201d Morris says of De Maria, referencing a concept by the urban sociologist Ray Oldenburg, who argued in 1989\u2019s \u201cThe Great Good Place\u201d that communities thrive in social spaces beyond homes and offices. These days, she says, \u201cYou\u2019re asking for a restaurant to be more than just food.\u201d\n\nRESTAURANTS, OF COURSE, have always been about more than just the food, whether it was New York\u2019s Four Seasons, designed in the International Style by Philip Johnson and William Pahlmann in 1958, or the organic austerity of the French Laundry, opened in Napa County in 1978, which for decades has defined a particular indoor-outdoor Northern Californian reverie. Meals worth traveling for are usually complemented by service and d\u00e9cor that\u2019s meant to soothe, excite or even dazzle in person. But now that every diner has a camera in her handbag, restaurateurs have been forced to acknowledge that what they\u2019re creating is not just a place where people consume meals but an aspirational space that, for many who experience it, exists only online. So even casual cafes \u2014 the sort that the MP Shift often designs \u2014 have to be stunning and distinctive enough to woo potential diners.\n\nMorris and Polonsky\u2019s projects often reflect the idea that these places become most enticing when filled with the same global, minimalist details (imported tiles, Alvar Aalto stools, oak tables) that appeal when encountered on social media, whether in pictures of other restaurants, or even of homes or hotels. \u201cThey asked me to open a Pinterest account,\u201d says Gonzalo Go\u00fbt, the co-owner of Verde, an erstwhile salad counter in New York\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood, who hired the MP Shift in 2016. All of Verde\u2019s ingredients came from the farmer\u2019s market, so Go\u00fbt used his virtual mood board to create a look that \u201cconveyed that sense of the natural,\u201d he says. Following this exercise, Morris and Polonsky built a dramatic counter of triangular slices of green and pink marble, which also adorned the facade as terrazzo. The final touch was the logo, with the restaurant\u2019s name rendered in a fat, cheery pink-and-green sans serif.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nAs Morris and Polonsky\u2019s portfolio grows, new clients increasingly reach out because they want to replicate a detail that they\u2019ve seen only in photographs. In Houston, Kelly Barnhart will soon open Vibrant, an all-day cafe serving \u201cadaptogenic potions\u201d and grain salads out of a former laundromat. She was impressed with De Maria after seeing the space in a magazine, and brought the MP Shift on as consultants last spring. Working with Lake Flato, a local architecture firm, Barnhart plans to install long, leather-clad L-shaped banquettes, vintage Tobias Scarpa lamps and drawings by the New York artist Karin Haas, whose work abstracts patterns she finds in nature.\n\nThe room\u2019s look will probably feel familiar: comforting, even. But having become known for an identifiable style over the past few years, Morris and Polonsky are now at pains to escape its tyranny. Back at De Maria, Polonsky points out a geometrically patterned wall inspired by kintsugi (the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery with thin threads of lacquer mixed with precious metals) that they created by filling cracks within the restaurant\u2019s vintage subway tiles. Potential clients constantly request this motif, but Morris and Polonsky aren\u2019t interested in replicating it. Likewise, they avoid Prouv\u00e9 chairs and parti-colored Max Lamb marble. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy for our clients to say, \u2018We should do a pink place with midcentury chairs,\u2019 \u201d Morris says. \u201cBut we don\u2019t want them to fall into that trend. We don\u2019t want them to say, \u2018Let\u2019s put avocado toast on the menu.\u2019 \u201d\n\nInstead, one of the MP Shift\u2019s new European clients is adopting a primary-colored palette that seems inspired, in part, by another recent internet phenomenon: the resurgence of the designer Ettore Sottsass and his Memphis Group. At the forthcoming Parisian cafe Echo, the menus and logo will feature Crayola red, blue and yellow that suggest mid-80s Los Angeles. Morris and Polonsky predict Europe\u2019s next trend-driven restaurant interiors might include angular Serge Mouille sconces and chrome seating, Formica counters and linoleum floors; in this context, these mundane American surfaces would likely feel modern. Though soon enough they, too, will be retired, making way for a new aesthetic to serve a new generation of diners who need to rest their phone on a lambent tabletop, order a hemp-milk cortado and, perhaps, post a photo or two.", "keywords": ["allday", "yorks", "feel", "look", "polonsky", "morris", "shift", "space", "women", "mp", "clients", "restaurants", "cafe", "responsible", "maria"], "polarity": 0.08876471324818433, "subjectivity": 0.37001001753067864},

For centuries, men have braved the open waters, knowing full well they may never make it home, and the mermaid has served as either a kind of ballast in times of trouble, saving sailors from floods and deadly storms, or a figure of seduction, luring them to their deaths at the bottom of the ocean. Her passivity, as well as her beguiling exoticness, is an escape from whatever drudgery awaits these men back on land \u2014 the mermaid is a fantasy, yes, but also a way to explain the unexplainable in nature.

Their love also demonstrates a kind of compassion that feels profoundly absent right now.

Credit Domingo Milella\n\nSurrounded by the Baltic Sea, about 60 miles off the southeastern coast of Sweden\u2019s mainland, Gotland is the largest of the country\u2019s bucolic islands (which number well over 200,000), and one that has a seemingly split personality. In the short summer season \u2014 primarily July and August, when temperatures hover in the balmy 70s \u2014 revelers descend on this mostly wild, windswept and sparsely populated province for all-night partying and the rambunctious weeklong electronic music festival Stockholmsveckan. Outside of high season, though \u2014 and anywhere outside of its largest town, Visby (population: 24,300) \u2014 Gotland remains a rural paradise, popular with outdoorsy Stockholm professionals looking to escape city life by hiking along the island\u2019s craggy limestone cliffs and cycling past tiny clapboard fishing villages, crumbling medieval churches and 18th-century farmhouses. Several Stockholm-based architects have even chosen to build their own startlingly contemporary houses on the tradition-bound island.\n\nLately, Gotland has been attracting a growing stream of international visitors, too. Chalk it up to gloomy political and environmental forecasts if you will, but as travelers increasingly seek out pristine landscapes offering peace and quiet, the island presents the perfect retreat \u2014 just a 40-minute flight from Stockholm. Design-forward boutique hotels offer access to nature that doesn\u2019t require pitching a tent in the wilderness, and a clutch of remarkably good restaurants \u2014 serving fresh-caught Baltic fish and all manner of organic locally grown vegetables \u2014 show off the bounty of the surrounding farmland. Throw in a few charming craft-oriented Nordic design shops and an impressively large collection of museums for an island with a population of just 60,000, and you have a compelling reason to skip the mainland entirely.\n\nImage The Revolver Hotel in Visby, which is owned and decorated by the conceptual designer Ingela Tanaka Rohnstrom.

The wood-beamed interiors of the 18th-century farmhouse are endlessly photogenic, decorated with pastel floral wallpaper, sheepskin throw rugs and jugs of freshly picked wildflowers. During the summer, there are live folk music performances in the property\u2019s barn, and the traditionally Swedish restaurant \u2014 which uses produce from the hotel\u2019s own two-acre garden \u2014 is considered one of the best on Gotland.\n\nFabriken Furillen\n\nAn imposing former factory building on the site of an old limestone quarry might not sound particularly inviting, but photographer Johan Hellstrom had a vision for what it could become, and he turned this industrial patch of land into a high-end escape (about an hour\u2019s drive northeast of Visby) after purchasing the abandoned factory in 1999. The 19 guest rooms all have Hastens beds and a color scheme dominated by soothing grays and white, so there\u2019s nothing to detract from the natural, forested surroundings. For those who really want to detach, there\u2019s a \u201cHermit Cabin\u201d on the grounds \u2014 an isolated outpost (a 20-minute bike ride from the main building) with no running water, no Wi-Fi and free-roaming cows and sheep as your only neighbors.\n\nRevolver Hotel\n\nTucked into a quiet courtyard in central Visby, the three-year-old Revolver is an under-the-radar hotel option in Gotland\u2019s main town \u2014 there\u2019s no website and no outside signage, so word of mouth has been the main driver for bookings here. Quirky d\u00e9cor dominates \u2014 think sparkly golden bathroom tiles, vintage rotary phones as objets d\u2019art, and Fornasetti wallpaper depicting hot air balloons \u2014 all of it the singular vision of its owner, the conceptual designer Ingela Tanaka Rohnstrom. There\u2019s no restaurant, but the hotel is within walking distance of the main commercial blocks of Visby, and three of the nine guest rooms have a full kitchen and living room. 011-46-70-639-39-01\n\nImage The seasonal restaurant and hotel Krakas Krog, in the Kr\u00e4klingbo countryside.

The day\u2019s specials are written on a chalkboard at the entrance and often include baked perch with celeriac and truffle vinaigrette, lobster soup with black radish, and fried herring with spring onion butter and mashed potatoes. In warm weather, simple wooden tables are set up on the street outside \u2014 the ideal place to sip a glass of Chardonnay and watch the summer crowds pass by.\n\nKrakas Krog\n\nA 40-minute drive east across Gotland from Visby brings you to this hybrid restaurant and hotel in the middle of the Kr\u00e4klingbo countryside. There\u2019s a highly seasonal tasting menu of six to eight courses \u2014 regular ingredients include grilled beetroot, local lamb, and frogs\u2019 legs sourced from the nearby pond \u2014 all presented by one of the cooks in the spare, minimalist dining room. And with only one seating a night, there\u2019s a sense of special occasion that permeates dinners here. The three guest rooms are similarly simple and refined, all in varying shades of white, with wide-plank wood floors and fluffy down comforters.\n\nLilla Bjers\n\nThis 30-acre family-run farm on the outskirts of Visby is surrounded by vegetable fields and fruit orchards, from which it sources the ingredients for its organic, constantly changing menu.

What, then, explains its recent crop of contemporary residences?\n\nImage The minimalist plaster box that serves as architect Bolle Tham\u2019s vacation home rises from a ridge above one of Gotland\u2019s stony beaches. Credit Mikael Olsson\n\nTHE DANISH-NORWEGIAN WRITER Aksel Sandemose was a minor literary figure, a notorious crank, when he wrote the 1933 novel containing a set of commandments that would become one of Scandinavia\u2019s defining social texts. \u201cA Fugitive Crosses His Tracks\u201d is a barely veiled send-up of his hometown, Nykobing Mors (renamed Jante) and an uncomfortably close-to-the-bone satire of Nordic conformity. Jante is governed by the \u201cLaw of Jante,\u201d rules for living that reflect both Scandinavia\u2019s ethnic homogeneity and its long-held belief that people are happier when both pleasure and pain are spread among all citizens:\n\nYou shall not believe that you are someone.\n\nYou shall not believe that you are as good as we are.\n\nYou shall not believe that you are any wiser than we are.\n\nYou shall never indulge in the conceit of imagining that you are better than we are.\n\nYou shall not believe that you know more than we do.\n\nYou shall not believe that you are more important than we are.\n\nYou shall not believe that you are going to amount to anything.\n\nYou shall not laugh at us.\n\nYou shall not believe that anyone cares about you.\n\nYou shall not believe that you can teach us anything.\n\nThese days, Scandinavians bristle at the mention of the Law of Jante. Such stereotypes, they insist, no longer have such a stronghold in a modern world, one where Stockholm now leads in billion-dollar technology companies per capita, second only to Silicon Valley.\n\nYet it is hard not to think of Sandemose as you drive along the winter-deserted roads of Gotland, Sweden\u2019s largest island, a 40-minute flight south from Stockholm. About the size of Long Island and flat as a soccer field, it is the country\u2019s sunniest locale. (Admittedly, that doesn\u2019t say much in a place that spends most of the year in frigid darkness.) And along with Faro, its companion island off its northern tip, it is forever associated with the director Ingmar Bergman, who set many of his greatest films here and lived in Faro for the last decades of his life. In July and early August, Gotland is a tourist mecca; young professionals, starved for heat and light, party in the beer gardens of Visby, a port town of 24,300. An hour or two away, up and down the coasts, are the summer houses of the country\u2019s politicians and business executives, fronting beaches dotted with rauks \u2014 gigantic, craggy sculptural formations unique to the area, as ghostly as something from Stonehenge, created by ice-age reef erosions. Scarlet poppies and brilliant blue viper\u2019s bugloss carpet the meadows and line the roadside ditches.\n\nImage The director Ingmar Bergman\u2019s study, preserved as part of a retreat for artists and writers on the island of Faro, north of Gotland. Credit Mikael Olsson\n\nBut by late August, tourist season is over. There is no gradual wind-down here, just a sudden deflation, like the circus pulling up stakes in a rush. Unlike the Stockholm Archipelago, a set of islands near the capital that Swedes visit year-round, Gotland seems to disappear like Brigadoon. A number of restaurants and inns outside of Visby, including the minimalist 19-suite Fabriken Furillen, owned by the former photographer Johan Hellstrom, shut down, and the flora dies as well, laying bare the local architecture. So stripped-down and uniform are the farmhouses of Gotland\u2019s interior, no matter what century they were built in they seem to have been drawn by a 5-year-old: rectangles topped with triangular roofs, each with a plain door and a few tiny frameless windows. The summer cottages along the largely unmarked roads are also free of embellishment: low-slung bungalows painted a familiar Falu red, the auburn-hued weather-resistant oil pigment derived from the copper mines of Dalarna, in central Sweden, during the 16th century. \u201cPeople have always come to Gotland to get back to tradition and nature,\u201d says Joel Phersson, a 35-year-old architect who works and lives on the island. \u201cIf you were to tell your friends in Stockholm that you\u2019re going to your family\u2019s vacation house here, you\u2019d perhaps be telegraphing that you are well off but very low-key. Ostentation is a high crime.\u201d\n\nBut recently, a generation of homeowners and architects, including Phersson\u2019s firm Skalso, have started not just ignoring, but defying the Law of Jante. Working around restrictive zoning laws that prioritize \u201cprotection and preservation\u201d of the island, which was settled more than 9,000 years ago as an agricultural hub, they have spent the last decade building contemporary houses as distinctive as the topography. From cast-concrete bunkers to glass-framed aeries, the new houses shock, subverting long-established order with a cool blast of modernity, while also paying homage to the island\u2019s chilly dignity.\n\nImage At left, the residence by married architects Hans Murman and Ulla Alberts is wrapped in a scrim printed with life-size photographs of the surrounding juniper trees.

Credit Mikael Olsson\n\nHANS MURMAN AND his wife, Ulla Alberts, architects who own a firm in Stockholm that often designs health spas, were in a perfect position to experiment on Gotland. The secluded parcel on which they built their Juniper House is owned by Alberts\u2019s family; she spent barefoot summers in her parents\u2019 still-standing red cottage. Before conceptualizing their own house, the couple designed a number of structures for relatives on the 2.2-acre plot, inadvertently creating a sort of stages-of-man evolutionary chart of their aesthetic. In addition to a studio that they made as newlyweds \u2014 little more than a shack \u2014 the property includes her brother\u2019s unadorned two-story limestone farmhouse built in 2002 from plans that the 54-year-old Alberts drafted in architecture school, as well as a 1,700-square-foot, midcentury-inflected villa with a peaked wooden roof and bright orange accents that the couple finished in 2014 for Ulla\u2019s sister. Over a decade ago, they completed the home that would become their ultimate statement, a dwelling in dialogue with the thicket of 15-foot juniper trees in which it hides. To create its innovative cladding, the 71-year-old Murman photographed the conifers, then had the images transposed in 1:1 scale onto a vinyl scrim. The mural wraps around the building\u2019s wooden exterior on a galvanized steel frame about two feet from the walls. The house, a mere 540 square feet puzzled out with the ingenuity of a yacht to accommodate their two sons, recedes into the forest during the day \u2014 somewhat of a poke to local officials who fretted that a modern structure would mar the landscape \u2014 yet glows at night like a botanical Noguchi lantern. \u201cWe are in our own world here,\u201d Murman says. \u201cAmong these houses there is every era, every generation. Just walking around you can travel through time.\u201d\n\nA 45-minute drive away, past a weathered windmill and fields of sheep fat with winter wool, Asa Myrdal Bratt has come from the mainland to meet me at her house. Built right on a rarely traveled road, it seems to rise from an empty field like a giant charred barn after a merciless prairie fire. That is precisely the effect that Stockholm-based architect Jens Enflo was seeking when his firm built it in collaboration with Deve Architects several years ago: \u201cI wanted it to seem as though the land was just growing all the way through it,\u201d the 42-year-old Enflo says. Clad in nearly black stained pine, a hue virtually unseen on Gotland and one that suggests shou sugi ban, the ancient Japanese burnt-timber treatment, the structure plays with proportion and transparency in a painterly way, contrasting against the flat, tree-void site. Almost 80 feet long but just under 15 feet wide, with a peaked 22-foot ceiling and a single lofted bedroom, the house\u2019s front and back walls are partially glass, as are most of its interior walls; the central area between the living room and the small guest wing holds a covered courtyard, completing the illusion of a raw, skeletal frame. Myrdal Bratt \u2014 a brand consultant in her 50s, who, with her husband, a doctor, bought the house in 2014 \u2014 says that the place is warm, even cozy, despite its openness; from the outside, it appears provocatively barren, a stripped-down interpretation of the working livestock barns that you can see in the distance.\n\nImage Gotland\u2019s typically flat meadowland seems to flow through the barnlike house created by Jens Enflo\u2019s firm and Deve Architects. Credit Mikael Olsson\n\nNOT ALL OF the several dozen modern houses on Gotland are entirely at peace with the island\u2019s natural and agricultural history; some, in fact, actively challenge the surrounding landscape. Consider the harshly reductive house that the 48-year-old architect Bolle Tham\u2019s firm built for his family: From the outside it resembles army barracks, with an exterior of local plaster, colored with carbon and troweled smooth atop a masonry core. Inside, all of the rooms face a central courtyard, giving it a snug, insular feel, though there are several wall-size windows that swing out like barn doors on summer days. Although it\u2019s one level, some of the rooms demand several steps \u2014 a necessary design quirk after Tham resisted blasting the underlying rock to lay a uniform slab; he felt the house should follow the landscape\u2019s topography. The living areas are nearly naked, the bedrooms cell-like, the finishes plywood. \u201cGotland\u2019s vacation homes had become clich\u00e9, so we thought it was time to do something that wasn\u2019t a replica of an old limestone farmhouse,\u201d he says. \u201cWe wanted to be in conversation with the past, but not just repeat it.\u201d\n\nStill, Tham\u2019s shed-like edifice seems recessive, even humble, compared with a collection of homes being built on the island\u2019s Bungenas peninsula, a few miles from the seven-minute ferry to Faro. In 2007, the 49-year-old real-estate developer Joachim Kuylenstierna bought a gated 400 acres that had originally been a quarry and then, during the Cold War, the site for 100 bunkers.\n\nThere are now more than 30 homes on Bungenas, in addition to a coffee house, a six-room hotel and a concert venue converted from an old barn. All the businesses and a majority of the homes have been designed by Skalso, the firm Kuylenstierna founded with Phersson and his fellow architect, the 38-year-old Erik Gardell, because there wasn\u2019t anyone on the island who could shape the sort of avant-garde vacation community they desired. The commune alludes to the Sea Ranch, the meticulously planned 1960s utopia in Northern California \u2014 albeit modified to include Gotland\u2019s bunkers, some of which Skalso modernized by scooping out enough earth on one side to allow for an entry, making them a kind of Swedish hobbit dwelling. Most of these subterranean residences, which owners tend to furnish with a sparseness that borders on clinical, are less than 600 square feet, a size that the economical Swedes deem sufficient for a family of four.\n\nImage To follow the natural curve of the land and avoid blasting into dense rock, Tham, the architect, designed the concrete floors of his near-bare dwelling to rise and fall from room to room. Credit Mikael Olsson\n\nBut one owner, a Swedish industrialist who bought one of the largest bunkers in the development six years ago, asked Skalso to take the firm\u2019s concept to astonishing depths, both aesthetically and literally. On approach, his house appears to be a one-story ultra-Brutalist box, made from concrete \u2014 a material rarely used for houses on Gotland \u2014 that had been poured into wooden molds to lend it a grain. Yet the 1,300-square-foot building that\u2019s visible above ground, which includes hushed, honed public spaces in dark wood, a welded metal kitchen and two minimalist bedrooms, represents less than a fifth of the total living space: The rest is beneath grade, on three floors, descending nearly 50 feet.\n\nThe excavation and underground construction process felt like laboring in the mines. Skalso preserved and exposed as much of the original concrete structure as possible, connecting a series of high-ceilinged, lavishly spare, skillfully lit rooms with a spiral, matte-black steel staircase. In addition to a vast dining room, there is a large, round marble-lined hammam installed in a former missile silo; the sky is visible through a glass porthole three flights above. Next to it is a \u201cspa\u201d with custom rubber sofas. Despite how sleek and chillingly soundproof the place is \u2014 you half-expect to hear muffled screams from somewhere in the depths \u2014 the owners, who, incongruously, have two young children, are clearly aware of their house\u2019s inherent drama: In a niche along one of the subterranean corridors, Skalso added a metal shelving unit stacked with cans of baked beans and bottled water, a wink to contemporary survivalist clich\u00e9s.\n\nIt is an extreme way to live, but in the end Gotland, despite its reputation for placid beauty, is pretty extreme itself: remote and wind-whipped and fierce \u2014 with, finally, a corresponding architecture. There are more contemporary houses in the works on the island over the next decade, including a streamlined enclave of a dozen on the island\u2019s northeast inlet anchored by the Fabriken Furillen inn. The Law of Jante, it turns out, especially its final tenet \u2014 \u201cYou shall not believe you can teach us anything\u201d \u2014 is no longer true here, amid the quiet farmhouses, the monochrome of Falu red, the biblical sky that never ends. Subversion, it seems, takes its most intriguing form when there is something beautiful and pure to bend. \u201cYou need the right background to change the way people think,\u201d Enflo had said, staring out at the field from the wide-open house he designed. \u201cIt\u2019s that contrast that makes you free.\u201d\n\nRelated:\n\nA Guide to Gotland, a Rural Paradise Off the Swedish Coast\n\nWhere the Swedes Go to Be (Really) Alone\n\nCold Comfort at the Edge of the World\n\nNot All Scandinavian Design is Minimalist\n\nBornholm: Crafts and Sunshine on the Danish Isle\n\nNancy Hass is the writer at large for T Magazine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["houses", "islands", "shockingly", "house", "firm", "gotland", "built", "jante", "swedish", "architecture", "modern", "shall", "believe", "island", "skalso", "lowkey"], "polarity": 0.07554829927906855, "subjectivity": 0.43524690978537145},

But inside the couple\u2019s airy East Village apartment, which smells faintly of Assam tea and glints with eye-catching Indian regional crafts \u2014 miniature caskets inlaid with mother-of-pearl, hand-woven kauna grass baskets, carved wooden spirit masks collected on their travels through Rajasthan, Kerala and Goa \u2014 everything sparkles with light.\n\nShah creates intricate decorations for European and American fashion houses using traditional Indian craftsmanship; she and her mother run the Mumbai-based bespoke embroidery company Aditiany, which produces hand-finished embellishments for the likes of Gucci, Erdem and Alexander McQueen. Honawar, a hotelier and restaurateur, operates, among other properties, the five-bedroom hotel 28 Kothi in Jaipur \u2014 a terraced jewel box of a guesthouse owned by Siddharth Kasliwal, an heir to Jaipur\u2019s legendary jewelry emporium the Gem Palace. In the eight years since the pair started dating, and the two since they were married in Jaipur, Honawar and Shah\u2019s respective creative worlds have become inextricable.\n\nYou have likely already seen Shah\u2019s work, possibly without realizing it. The gold sequin snakes that wound up on the Renaissance-inspired gowns of Gucci\u2019s cruise 2018 collection are the handiwork of Aditiany artisans. Each iridescent sea-foam-green sequin on the shimmering Calvin Klein dress that Lupita Nyong\u2019o wore to the 2016 Met Gala was applied, by hand, at the company\u2019s Mumbai atelier. Shah, who grew up in New York and learned the trade by working with her mother (who founded Aditiany in 1991), helps brands realize their most otherworldly visions, overseeing a 30-person-plus team of fabric buyers and embroiderers in Mumbai and New York. The atelier has helped transform a mohair sweater into a garden of silk trompe-l\u2019oeil roses (Dolce & Gabbana), hand-beaded an entire custom jumpsuit tailored to model Bella Hadid\u2019s body (Alexander Wang) and turned a velvet Saint Laurent smoking jacket into a galaxy of embroidered stars for Keith Richards.\n\nProducing each design requires its own kind of sleight of hand. The 33-year-old Shah splits her time between her studio in Mumbai and New York, where Aditiany has a showroom in the garment district, a storehouse filled with thousands of embroidery swatches: There are yards of gold bullion fringe and Chantilly lace, a rainbow of Murano glass beads and a vast library of brilliant crystals and semiprecious stones. She also makes about four trips a year to Europe to discuss upcoming collections with various houses. The creative process is collaborative: Design teams relay their references for the upcoming season, and Shah then presents samples of embellished fabrics \u2014 \u201920s-\u200bstyle bead-\u200btrimmed lace, fragile Tyrolean-esque flower-stitched silk tulle and new embellishment techniques being developed by the studio in Mumbai, such as embroidery using recycled materials \u2014 that might fulfill those imaginings.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRecently, Honawar began accompanying Shah on her visits to London, Paris and Milan, and joining her at meetings. \u201cAt first, people thought it was bizarre for me to meet [with] all these houses,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I thought it was so interesting to sit there with someone like the head of Gucci or Prada as they tell you what they\u2019re going to do for the next few seasons.\u201d Maintaining a blurred boundary between personal and professional life could make some couples feel claustrophobic, but for Shah, Honawar\u2019s interest is both creatively fulfilling and fun. Building relationships with luxury brands has given the 34-year-old Honawar ideas for new businesses as well, including a forthcoming design studio, a collaboration with his wife that Shah says will offer \u201ceverything from linens to glassware to the perfect towel,\u201d and will highlight the best of Indian artisanal traditions.\n\nLike Shah, Honawar, who was raised in Mumbai, works mainly between India and New York. In addition to co-founding 28 Kothi in Jaipur, the three-outlet gastropub the Woodside Inn and the Pantry, a bakery in Mumbai, he also co-founded Inday, a vegetable-heavy cafe in N.Y.C.\u2019s NoMad district. Along with two new projects in Mumbai \u2014 the recently opened Bombay Vintage, a traditional Indian restaurant, and a still unnamed Southeast Asian restaurant and cocktail bar \u2014 he\u2019s also developing a Puglian-influenced auberge on 60 acres in the Rajasthani countryside. For years, he says, major Indian cities simply didn\u2019t have the kind of dining options you\u2019d find in Paris or London: You ate meals at home, not outside of it.

For nearly a year, he and his team searched the globe for the best artisans working with fabric, from manjak weavers in southern Senegal to ribbon embroiderers in New Delhi, eventually partnering with over 100 ateliers to create 50 made-to-order tapestries (plus 12 matching tote bags), which will debut at Salone del Mobile in Milan next month.\n\nEach piece tells its own story: A Kyoto-made patchwork (bottom, second from right), for instance, features sashiko, a centuries-old sewing method originally used by Japanese farmers, characterized by \u201clittle stabs\u201d of white thread against indigo-blue cotton. For several other designs, a father-and-son-run workshop with a single loom in Aubusson, France, used a digital pattern generator to reproduce sepia-toned images from Anderson\u2019s collection of found 19th- and early-20th-century photography. (The hand-dyed, multicolored stripe covering three nude figures\u2019 midsections on one of these came from a mother-and-son business in Mumbai.) For Anderson, it\u2019s a celebration of craftsmanship and a reminder that, in our fast-paced world, time may be the greatest luxury. \u201cThere\u2019s this idea that we can consume everything digitally and we don\u2019t pause,\u201d he says. \u201cHow exciting that in the midst of all that, this sort of artistry is still happening today.\u201d Prices upon request. \u2014 JACOBA URIST\n\nImage Credit Anders Ahlgren\n\nHeat Wave\n\nBerbere \u2014 a deep-red spice blend whose recipe, like those for curry and mole, varies from kitchen to kitchen, but typically begins with red pepper, cardamom, fenugreek and ginger \u2014 has long been a staple in Ethiopian cooking. \u201cIt\u2019s what lends the stewed and roasted dishes called wats their distinctive and aromatic heat,\u201d says Sam Saverance, co-owner of Brooklyn\u2019s vegan Bunna Cafe, which serves a red lentil wat (at the center of the platter pictured above) as well as kategna, a berbere and olive oil paste spread over injera (sourdough flatbread). In addition to making berbere-spiced classics, Christopher Roberson of Etete, a contemporary Ethiopian restaurant in Washington, D.C., has lately been experimenting with berbere in other types of dishes, too, as with his popular injera chicken tacos with collard greens and fresh farmer\u2019s cheese.\n\nNow, chefs across the country are following suit, and berbere is popping up in all kinds of cuisines. At Salare, a New American restaurant in Seattle, Edouardo Jordan braises blanched octopus in a sauce with berbere, red wine and crushed tomatoes \u2014 his spin on octopus tagine. \u201cThe complexity just wakes everything up,\u201d he says.

Chef Ayesha Nurdjaja, meanwhile, was inspired to recreate a berbere-rubbed chicken kebab for Shuka, Vicki Freeman and Marc Meyer\u2019s new Mediterranean place in New York, after spending a week with an all-male Bedouin tribe in the Moroccan desert. The key, says Ari Bokovza, who recently added a pan-roasted hake with a berbere-laced chickpea ragout to the menu at New York\u2019s Claudette, is to avoid store-bought blends \u2014 his take includes caraway, turmeric and spiced paprika. \u201cIt\u2019s not labor intensive, so why not make it your own?\u201d \u2014 KATIE CHANG\n\nImage Credit Nicolas Matheus\n\nModern Country\n\nNinety minutes east of Lisbon, amid the knotted olive trees and historic farmhouses of Portugal\u2019s Alentejo region, sits the defiantly modernist Villa Extramuros.

The facades of the new structures \u2014 perfect cubes of 500 square feet \u2014 are covered with local cork, and their interiors have been outfitted in a style Savatier calls \u201c\u00e9cologique-pop,\u201d with \u201970s-era brass lamps, handmade Artevida wall tiles, spindly-legged stools by Jasper Morrison and geometric prints by Aur\u00e9lie Nemours. Here, after a breakfast including fresh figs and pasteis de nata delivered right to their door, guests might venture out to the nearby city of \u00c9vora, home to a 13th-century Gothic cathedral and the remnants of a Roman temple. Those returning to the compound in the evening need not worry about getting lost in the groves \u2014 each bungalow has a rectangular neon light affixed to it, one red and the other a gleaming yellow. villa\u200bextramuros.com \u2014 GISELA WILLIAMS\n\nImage Credit Photograph by Charlie Schuck.

But when they do seek out a collaborator, it\u2019s one with both iconoclastic panache and refinement. Case in point: the 83-year-old Parisian industrial designer Marc Berthier, best known for his iconic 1967 plastic child\u2019s desk, the Ozoo. In 2010, Berthier designed the Carr\u00e9 H watch for Herm\u00e8s, which he\u2019s remade in elegant, slightly outsize proportions.\n\nA bold steel square with rounded-off edges \u2014 a Berthier signature \u2014 the timepiece is now 38 mm (the original is 36.5 mm) and slightly curved so it follows the arc of the wrist. A gray dial (it also comes in black) features a crosshatched guilloch\u00e9 center that catches the sun. The numerals, preceded by a zero, are softly brushed with an illuminating finish. The slender second hand comes in yellow or red; a dash of contrast that shows off its creator\u2019s good-natured playfulness. $7,125, hermes.com \u2014 NANCY HASS\n\nImage Credit Nicholas Calcott\n\nA Surrealist Console Table\n\nThe Duluth, Minn.-born, Brooklyn-based artist Misha Kahn cultivates detritus with a vengeance. At 28, he has shown his anarchic, cacophonous work \u2014 including one-of-a-kind furniture that incorporates found objects with weaving, glassblowing and metalwork \u2014 at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and as part of the artist Bjarne Melgaard\u2019s installation at the 2014 Whitney Biennial. For \u201cMidden Heap,\u201d his immersive exhibit last fall at the Friedman Benda gallery in Manhattan, he fashioned giant, otherworldly aquatic creatures out of refuse like plastic bags, shards of glass and a cast-off toilet seat found at the beach in Brooklyn\u2019s Dead Horse Bay. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Kahn likes to hear sound effects \u2014 slurping, squeaks \u2014 while he works. For his latest piece, he\u2019s mated his manic, modern method with the centuries-old tradition of bronze casting. The seven-foot-long console, available in a limited edition of eight, was sparked by the artist\u2019s longtime interest in surrealist animated shorts from the 1930s. With Noguchi-like edges, Boteroesque blobs and Tim Burton-inspired tendrils, the material gives his work a new gravitas, enshrining his joyful lunacy.

Credit Jason Larkin\n\n\u201cI CAN\u2019T QUITE deal with it,\u201d says Marc Camille Chaimowicz, in considerable understatement, on moving from the London apartment he has spent the past 38 years living and making his art in. The flat is on the top floor of Hayes Court, a 19th-century red brick building in Camberwell, South London, an area long known for having successive waves of artists such as Frank Auerbach and Griselda Pollock. We are sitting in the kitchen, which is filled with appliances from when he first moved in: the 1970s. That was also the era in which Chaimowicz, who is about to have his first solo museum exhibition in the U.S., at the Jewish Museum in New York, began creating his distinct body of cross-disciplinary work, which explores ideas of domestic life through fully realized life-size room installations that he fills with furniture, ceramics, collages, wallpaper, textiles and sculptures, many of which are his own design.\n\nThe influence of Chaimowicz\u2019s work is hard to pinpoint, but everyone familiar with his art agrees that it is substantial. Is it his imagined rooms, so evocatively furnished as to suggest a story? Or his classic drawings, suggestive of abstracted body parts or fractured parentheses that appear on everything from wallpaper to murals to fabric? His persistently joyous sense of color? Most likely, it\u2019s Chaimowicz\u2019s anarchic lack of distinction between public art and private life that makes him a pioneer and also an enigma. \u201cIt\u2019s not that he\u2019s being directly copied by other artists,\u201d says the British contemporary-art writer Louisa Buck. \u201cBut more that Chaimowicz has made a broad swath of practice permissible.\u201d In the post-Pop world of his early career, the idea of calling a lampshade a work of art was sacrilegious; colors such as pastel pink or eau de nil \u2014 signature Chaimowicz hues \u2014 were anathema. Now, the hierarchies between art and ornament have dissolved, and Chaimowicz has emerged, in Buck\u2019s estimation, \u201cas a presiding force over a growing group of artists who are unashamedly playing with d\u00e9cor and environments,\u201d Karen Kilimnik and Lucy McKenzie among them. His 2016 show at the Serpentine Gallery in London encapsulated both the singularity of the artist\u2019s aesthetic and the diversity of his vision: three rooms, each appointed with his colorful retro-futuristic furniture, dreamlike illustrated wallpapers and abstract sculptures made from repurposed items such as vases or jugs or chairs. \u201cChaimowicz has suddenly become an urgent artist in the age of the internet, as boundaries become more porous,\u201d says the Serpentine\u2019s artistic director Hans Ulrich Obrist. Kelly Taxter, curator of the Jewish Museum show, suggests he\u2019s particularly interesting now \u201cbecause the work is in one sense very esoteric and abstract, but it\u2019s also totally approachable. Everyone recognizes a chair and understands wallpaper. So there\u2019s an immediate understanding of his art, coupled with the layers of poetry behind it.\u201d\n\nAll of these layers \u2014 the everyday and the intellectual, the romantic and the rigorous, the domestic and the dramatic \u2014 are present in both the home he is leaving behind and his new one, located just over a mile away in Vauxhall, in a 12-sided free-standing brick-and-concrete building commissioned by Cabinet, the London gallery that represents Chaimowicz as well as Ed Atkins and Lucie Stahl. Designed by the British firm Trevor Horne Architects in collaboration with Cabinet\u2019s artists, the structure\u2019s three lowermost floors serve as the gallery\u2019s showspace; above are two floors of residential apartments, including Chaimowicz\u2019s. He\u2019s contributed to the building\u2019s facade, designing its large, jaggedly geometric windows, set in natural oak frames, an indication of Chaimowicz\u2019s innate inclination to live among his art pieces. Unsurprisingly, the interiors of both the Hayes Court and Cabinet flats keenly resemble his work. Each is constructed almost entirely from his imagination, from the lamps to the drapes to the wallpaper. As more than one curator who has worked with Chaimowicz has pointed out, his installations are Gesamtkunstwerk, or \u201ctotal work of art,\u201d and in Taxter\u2019s view they align the interior of the home with \u201cthe psychological and interior life of the artist.\u201d\n\nImage Chaimowicz\u2019s old flat has a time-warp feeling, thanks to a wealth of early 20th- and midcentury furniture, including these 1930s chairs in the sitting room. Credit Jason Larkin\n\nSpry and dressed in a corduroy jacket, a chevron scarf and a beige trilby, Chaimowicz gives me a tour of his Hayes Court flat, which consists of three humble rooms. The question of what the space will become is on his mind. It must live on in some way, he feels. As a museum dedicated to his work? A short-lived art installation? Its future is still uncertain, reliant perhaps on a benefactor. \u201cIs that a real Warhol?\u201d I ask, trying to stand back in the narrow corridor, papered with a whimsical white-and-gray Chaimowicz-designed pattern, to get a better view of a purple screen print of an electric chair hanging on the wall. \u201cYes,\u201d he replies, with a sidelong smile. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone, will you? It\u2019s quite discreet.\u201d Then he considers the question again, and adds another layer of mischief. \u201cWhat is real?\u201d he asks, rhetorically. He shrugs. \u201cBut it\u2019s a signed edition.\u201d In the room nearest the front door is Chaimowicz\u2019s archive: documentation of his work organized into file boxes, a collection of decorated plates and another of ordinary, bourgeois-colored glass bowls and vases. In the room opposite this one is where he draws, a sunny space with a drafting table and bookshelves dotted with small-scale models and color charts. (When Taxter visited, she discovered there were nearly 100 maquettes of furniture designs \u2014 they were, she says, \u201cintimate and beautiful,\u201d and around half of them are on view at the Jewish Museum.)\n\nThe rest is a faded mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, an \u201cart scene,\u201d as a crime scene bears the traces of a crime. Everything feels like evidence of a life lived, as if the flat has already become a tribute, wonderfully trapped in time. This is in part because the furnishings not created by Chaimowicz are either design classics (by Otto Wagner and Eileen Gray) or simple, almost suburban, midcentury pieces (a \u201950s-era gas stove, red glossy chairs, \u201970s-era beige and salmon carpet). In the bathroom with a forever-dripping tap, the walls above the tub have been painted by Chaimowicz in Matisse-like patterns in his signature sun-faded, candy-colored palette. They are faint, repeated, reminiscent of something \u2014 colors inspired by Bonnard, perhaps, or Marie Laurencin, or textile sketches by Vanessa Bell. In the living room, which is papered in those same shades, a photograph of his previous apartment, a subsidized studio in the East End, where he lived briefly in the mid-70s, hangs on the wall, creating the effect that each of his homes relates to the next like a Russian nesting doll.\n\nImage The artist\u2019s new bedroom, brightened by furniture and a blanket of his own design.

Credit Jason Larkin\n\nTHE FOLLOWING DAY we meet in the new flat, where he is already sleeping, liberated, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the purest pleasure, partly because I\u2019m able to break free from my past.\u201d The walls already bear the mark of his arrival \u2014 he\u2019s left most of them bare and freshly plastered, \u201cwhat the Romans called patina,\u201d he says. At the entrance to the kitchen, he\u2019s covered a door in a purple, pink and orange bamboo stalk-print laminate of his own design. Inside the kitchen, similar patterns are collaged on the wall with many others \u2014 overlaid, clashing, apparently as random as strips of papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9, yet oddly classical in their prettiness. A curtain in his bedroom \u2014 echoing the graphic he recently designed for the cover of the London Underground pocket map \u2014 was made from fabric he designed with a pink, white and yellow chainlike motif. \u201cI\u2019ve declared this flat a white-free space,\u201d he says with a smile, revealing what appears to be a long-held yearning to live and create his art somewhere shiny and new.\n\nIf Chaimowicz\u2019s work is hard to classify, that\u2019s partly because its impact is sensory and indirect, like a mist. Memory, home, reverie, nostalgia, longing: These are all evoked. In a recent exhibition called \u201cTears Shared\u201d at the South London gallery Flat Time House, Chaimowicz showed a collection of jewel-toned glassware. He arranged the pieces against a conservatory wall. When the light caught them, it scattered multicolored rays around the room. In a film, such a sequence of rainbow refractions might be used to summon a childhood memory, or trigger a sunlit meditation. Here, one is meant to simply bask in the cast light and form a story of one\u2019s own. Taxter compares the experience to reading a book: \u201cYou\u2019re reading a story but you and the person next to you have a completely different projection of what the characters sound and look like.\u201d In the installation that launched his career in 1972, \u201cCelebration? Realife,\u201d he filled a former ballroom at Gallery House in London with cheap lights, everyday detritus and found objects \u2014 a scene that looked like the aftermath of an explosion in a dime store or a flea market or a disco. Then he invited viewers into another room to discuss the work over coffee. Also as part of the artwork, Chaimowicz slept in the building at night throughout the period of the exhibition.\n\nThe work that anchors the Jewish Museum show, which opens March 16, is called \u201cHere and There,\u201d and was first installed in 1978 across two rooms at the Hayward Gallery in London. One room evoked a domestic interior (\u201chere\u201d) and the other recreated a more formal gallery-type space (\u201cthere\u201d), with the intent of transferring art from the lived life into the exhibited one. That room contained collages of black-and-white photographs on movable panels. Because Chaimowicz works in a way that is site-specific, each of his shows has its own set of considerations. The iteration of \u201cHere and There\u201d for the Jewish Museum has been conceived because the building was once a home: Its history as a 1908 mansion belonging to the wealthy Warburg family and its ornate interior have become part of the story Chaimowicz has chosen to tell.\n\nImage The facade of the Cabinet gallery building in Vauxhall, for which Chaimowicz imagined the graphic windows. Credit Jason Larkin\n\nHis own story is one he reveals with less ease, and explains, perhaps, why he works in refractions. He was born in postwar Paris, to a Polish father and a French mother. They never spoke about the war. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about that. We never did,\u201d he says, as if his parents were alive and all the family rules still in place. His father, who had a degree in mathematics, got a job at Institut Curie in Paris and later became involved in early electronics. When Chaimowicz, who has two younger sisters, was about 8, the family moved to the U.K. \u201cYou see, my parents were very na\u00efve,\u201d he explains with his sly smile. \u201cThey\u2019d heard that the English education system was very good. They hadn\u2019t heard about the class system.\u201d\n\nChaimowicz, who spoke no English, arrived in the postwar period when the two-tier British education system left pupils that were less academic out in the cold. Armed, at 16, with very few qualifications, he went to Ealing Art College, then to the bohemian Camberwell School of Art, and did a postgraduate degree in painting at the famous Slade School of Fine Art. By the time he arrived, he had burned all of his paintings. He respected theorists and conceptual artists such as Victor Burgin and Gustav Metzger, yet he couldn\u2019t identify with any of them. Sympathetic to emerging currents in feminism, he found that intellectual art world very male. \u201cMy mind was drawn to left-wing ideology,\u201d he recalls. \u201cBut the left-wing practice produced art that I could not enjoy. It was lacking in pleasure, color and sensuality. All the things that matter to me.\u201d\n\nAt Slade, the classical premise that you must suffer for your art was pervasive, but Chaimowicz was having none of it. \u201cThe people I was looking at didn\u2019t seem to have suffered to that extent. Fragonard seemed to have a great time. I thought: I want to be like Fragonard!\u201d After graduation, Chaimowicz was awarded a studio space in East London by Acme, a nonprofit program that partners with London art schools to grant budding artists a subsidized place to create, and he volunteered in a fabric design studio in Lyon. As his interest in the applied arts evolved, his sense of work as an evolution of his life emerged too. Bonnard and Vuillard were a guiding light. \u201cIt was a very rich period in terms of my practice. I\u2019d think: I want some wallpaper but there\u2019s nothing I like and I can\u2019t really afford it anyway. Maybe I could make my own wallpaper,\u201d he says. \u201cI was prioritizing my lifestyle, to the extent that there were complaints about me to the head office. Other artists were walking down the road seeing me on the ground floor of my studio with floral curtains, drinking tea with friends and socializing, and they\u2019d say: \u2018This guy\u2019s not working! He\u2019s fraudulent, he\u2019s wasting precious space!\u2019 \u201d Out of that very transgression, Chaimowicz built a career.\n\nImage Almost everything inside the Cabinet gallery space is custom fit, including the sunburst fluorescent tube lighting on the ceiling.

Earlier, he\u2019d told me, apropos of the New York venue, \u201cI have no connection with the Jewish faith whatsoever,\u201d and although I understood the point about his upbringing and his mother\u2019s Catholicism, it seemed to leave part of the story untold. He suggested that we do some of the interview in French, and his childhood seemed a good topic to cover that way. We switched languages. The era and timbre of Chaimowicz\u2019s French is magnificent: rounded, classical, an accent that barely exists in contemporary France. It added a layer of intrigue: His native voice belongs not to a place but to the past.\n\n\u201cI grew up in Montparnasse,\u201d he began. He spoke of envying his sisters\u2019 dolls, and weekends spent in the suburbs with his maternal grandmother, who had warehouses she lent to people who ran flea markets. \u201cI spent every weekend chatting to the stallholders,\u201d Chaimowicz remembered. \u201cIt was wonderful for a boy of 6, 7, 8 years old.\u201d The nostalgia for such things is clearly embedded in his work, which incorporates found domestic objects (like the colored glass). And just when the Proustian reverie seemed about to take off, Chaimowicz said, by way of sudden punctuation: \u201cSo, that\u2019s childhood.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d I said. \u201cYou haven\u2019t spoken about your father.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t spoken about \u2026?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour father.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy father?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nThe equivocation felt, at the time, oddly prolonged.\n\nImage Having remained virtually unchanged since the \u201970s, the Hayes Court flat \u2014 filled with a mixture of Chaimowicz\u2019s work, vintage furniture and \u201950s appliances \u2014 is a work of art, a time capsule and a living space all in one. Credit Jason Larkin\n\nMost of what Chaimowicz told me about his father he preferred not to make public. We spoke about the reasons why \u2014 since an exhibition at the Jewish Museum would seem to precipitate some discussion of a Jewish link. Chaimowicz felt his father had suffered enough; his past had been taboo in his lifetime, and it was only right that it should remain so. Yet in respecting his need to preserve his father\u2019s privacy a point is made sideways: a point about history and identity, about how one can be excluded from groups to which one might be expected to belong; about fear, about memory, about gray areas of belief. And all of this offers some purchase on Chaimowicz\u2019s slippery lifelong subjects: home and remembrance, above all.\n\nChaimowicz\u2019s father was born Jewish but was not religious. His father\u2019s father was one of the founders of the Socialist party in Poland, and anti-Zionist. Chaimowicz p\u00e8re escaped to France and married Chaimowicz\u2019s mother; they brought up their children in the Catholic faith. Once they moved to Britain, the children had French and English culture to manage: They couldn\u2019t cope with a third. The link to Poland was, essentially, erased. Meanwhile, his father\u2019s family disappeared.\n\nChaimowicz suggests that, like many fathers of that era, his was not very present. But there was a moment of rapprochement between them. Chaimowicz was asked to have a show in Warsaw in 1993. He accepted as his father was dying in the hospital. The Warsaw curators wanted to publish one of his sketchbooks in facsimile, and he drew, as a frontispiece, a picture of his father. He\u2019d been to see him in the hospital, and he drew him from memory. He\u2019d never done anything like that before. The resulting resemblance was uncanny. We pause over this. The story makes a much broader sort of sense. His father might once have known him as a boy who could draw, yet memory and intimacy are what Chaimowicz has made his materials. In his hands, even a complicated reminiscence can become something lightly and mysteriously rendered, with the restorative force of a fleeting resurrection.", "keywords": ["flat", "house", "work", "artists", "art", "jewish", "london", "chaimowiczs", "room", "father", "chaimowicz"], "polarity": 0.09543352592747753, "subjectivity": 0.36521759938090576},

Other artists of that era put textiles at the center of an explicitly feminist program, using conventionally \u201cdainty\u201d handicrafts \u2014 knitting, crocheting, embroidery \u2014 to express ambivalence about childbearing, or rage at women\u2019s domestic oppression. For \u201cWomanhouse,\u201d a fabled group installation organized by Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro in an abandoned Hollywood mansion in 1972, the artist Faith Wilding created a room-size net of crochet work that recalled spider webs, Gothic horror films and human tissue, including uterine lining.\n\nThese artists weren\u2019t necessarily thinking of posterity. Textiles are notoriously difficult to conserve. Some fiber artists, taking their cues from the newly insurgent genre of performance art, intended their works to be temporary. Grossen, known for her sculptures and installations of braided rope that hang from the ceiling or twist along the floor, saw many of her largest works dismantled as the spaces they were created for (building lobbies, corporate offices) were altered or changed hands. The Polish-\u200bborn artist Magdalena Abakanowicz, who for nearly three decades beginning in the 1960s created haunting abstract sculptures in burlap and sisal, began working in bronze (a more traditionally \u201cheroic\u201d medium, valued for its durability) in the late 1980s. In fact, in the hierarchy of artistic materials, textiles (with the exception of tapestries) have often occupied a lowly rank. Toward the end of her life, even Anni Albers gave away her loom and her stock of threads, turning her attention to printmaking. \u201cShe said she realized that as a textile designer or weaver she would never be admitted to the magic circle of art,\u201d Sheila Hicks recalls.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYET A GENERATION later, fiber art looks fresh again. Two years ago, for example, the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas purchased one of octogenarian artist, author and activist Faith Ringgold\u2019s \u201cstory quilts\u201d for $461,000 \u2014 a record (times 30) for the artist. The quilts, which the painter began making in 1980 \u2014 inspired by Tibetan thangkas, her seamstress and designer mother and her great-great-great-grandmother, who quilted as a slave \u2014 combine painted canvas, fabric piecework and handwritten text to reclaim unexplored corners of African-American life and history. And for emerging artists, fiber offers renewed possibilities of eloquence and emotivity. Sophia Narrett, a recent Rhode Island School of Design graduate whose solo exhibition of embroideries opens at Brooklyn\u2019s BRIC Arts/Media center in May, wrote in an email, \u201cWhen an object is developed by human hands for hundreds of hours, it leaves a quality in the surface that can be sensed.\u201d Her wall hangings, stitched with cotton thread in a lush, painterly style, detail surreal encounters \u2014 naked figures cavorting in basements and woodlands; immolated princesses. Their hand-worked surfaces make them seem intimate and vulnerable, in keeping with her art\u2019s themes. \u201cThis physical commitment is a part of how I communicate my sincerity,\u201d Narrett explained. \u201cEmbroidery and its implicit history help specify the tone of my stories, one characterized by obsession, desire and both the freedoms and restraints of femininity.\u201d\n\nJane Austen, who sat writing \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d in a drawing room corner as her women friends whiled away the hours embroidering, might have arched an eyebrow. Can we really fight patriarchy with weapons borrowed from the history of upper-and-middle-class women\u2019s confinement? But then one remembers the one million knit \u201cpussy hats\u201d that appeared at last year\u2019s Women\u2019s March in Washington. Pussy hat co-creator Jayna Zweiman learned to knit while in architecture school and returned to it while recovering from an injury. \u201cI went with my friend Krista to a knitting store and discovered a place where you could be with people and listen,\u201d she said on the phone from L.A. \u201cThings kind of flow, and everyone is supportive. I think it\u2019s a fantastic model for community.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nZweiman\u2019s most recent effort is the Welcome Blanket project: more than 2,675 40-by-40-inch blankets, created by people from across the U.S. and abroad in response to President Trump\u2019s proposed border wall. After being exhibited at the University of Chicago\u2019s Smart Museum of Art last fall, the blankets \u2014 objects of protest transformed into instruments of comfort and hospitality \u2014 are currently being distributed to newly arrived refugees.\n\nIn fact, fiber art, with its inherent portability (you can fold it, roll it, wear it) seems uniquely suited to our era of geopolitical crisis and mass migration. In \u201cSanctuary\u201d \u2014 a recent project by the San Francisco-based FOR-SITE Foundation \u2014 handmade wool rugs designed by 36 international artists reflecting on themes of refuge, cultural identity and displacement covered the floor of Fort Mason Chapel. Visitors were asked to remove their shoes to experience the work: \u201cIt makes people feel more vulnerable,\u201d the curator Cheryl Haines explained. \u201cBut the rugs are so sumptuous \u2014 people tell me they also feel calmed and engulfed.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s something the Chinese artist Lin Tianmiao also noticed in her recent show at New York\u2019s Galerie Lelong & Co., for which she carpeted the space with antique Chinese rugs, thickly embroidered with words in several languages denoting \u201cwoman,\u201d ranging from cryptic sexual slang (\u201cburger\u201d) to expressions of devotion (\u201cgoddess\u201d). Many of the phrases were derogatory, and yet \u201cit surprised me,\u201d Lin said, \u201cthat almost every viewer seemed to be very happy within the work.\u201d\n\nCall it the \u201cfiber effect,\u201d if you will. It must be part of what motivates guerrilla yarn-bombers who, under cover of darkness, envelope fire hydrants, tree trunks and parking meters with knitted coverings that seem like the product of someone\u2019s seriously wacky grandmother. (The movement\u2019s Texas-based founder, Magda Sayeg, once knitted the equivalent of a tea cozy for an entire Mexico City bus.) In a political climate marked by its coldheartedness, let\u2019s not underestimate fiber\u2019s power to evoke memories of a more congenial era, to celebrate the handmade and, not incidentally, invoke wonder and that rarest and most coveted of emotions: joy.", "keywords": ["textiles", "rugs", "political", "artist", "provocative", "artists", "recent", "art", "created", "womens", "history", "fibers", "fiber"], "polarity": 0.15751200853940583, "subjectivity": 0.46186325090434677},

Styled by Malina Joseph Gilchrist\n\nFROM RICK OWENS\u2019S ragged T-shirts and canvas shifts to the giddy ornamentation of Alessandro Michele\u2019s Gucci, all glitz and blitz and reconstituted Elton John costumes, the spring collections appeared to not have a common thread between them \u2014 a seemingly bipolar mix of downtrodden, derelict styles and escapist fantasies. Rei Kawakubo\u2019s Boschean excess at Comme des Gar\u00e7ons \u2014 clashing Renaissance paintings and Japanese cartoons as prints and reconstituted pileups of tacky plastic children\u2019s toys as headpieces \u2014 was a stark contrast to Miuccia Prada\u2019s comic-book-print warrior women and the tatty gewgaws and currency-\u200bwar patterns of Demna Gvasalia\u2019s Balenciaga collection. There, the idea of luxury was debased and devalued with gaudy dresses, blouses and skintight pant-boot hybrids cut in post-Brexit-inspired euro-note and dollar-bill patterns.\n\nSo, what is it with fashion at the moment? Designers appear to have assumed a fight-or-flight response to these uncertain times, which, to some \u2014 especially those with a flair for the dramatic \u2014 look a lot like the end of days. \u201cFashion is a reflection of the way we live,\u201d said Gvasalia backstage at Balenciaga. \u201cI wanted to create a feeling that something dangerous was going to happen.\u201d He was talking, specifically, about the sturm-und-drang mood at his show, which took place in a blacked-out venue filled with smoke and the boom of ominous trip hop music. The message was less \u201capocalypse now\u201d and more \u201capocalypse soon.\u201d\n\nArt, literature and film frequently tackle themes of end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it destruction \u2014 in 2017 alone, there was the TV adaptation of Margaret Atwood\u2019s dystopian novel, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d which felt eerily prophetic; Kara Walker\u2019s towering Goya-esque murals shown at New York\u2019s Sikkema Jenkins & Co. in September, which depicted the unfolding of a modern, racially charged civil war; the artist Jonathan Horowitz\u2019s doctored photo of President Trump playing golf while the sky above him burned; and, even, a sequel to that earlier neon-fizzed end-times nightmare, \u201cBlade Runner.\u201d But apocalyptic naysaying is less frequently found in fashion, an industry that trades on optimism, fantasy and, most importantly, an ability to predict the future. But in moments of great distress, even clothing tends to reflect our troubles. Immediately prior to the outbreak of war in 1939, there was a surfeit of Austrian and Bavarian influences in the industry; in the late \u201980s, Black Monday gave way to the rise of a movement dubbed \u201cdeconstruction\u201d that originated with the Belgian designer Martin Margiela, whose leitmotif was the unfinished hem and the inside-out seam. His clothes were purposefully made to look poor \u2014 because the world suddenly was. It was a volte-face to the excess of the early \u201980s, the dancing-on-the-lip-of-the-volcano styles of Christian Lacroix and his archaic indulgences of crinoline pouf skirts and Second Empire extremes.\n\nImage With his two-in-one garments \u2014 a car coat stitched atop a vest; a trench attached to a denim jacket \u2014 Balenciaga designer Demna Gvasalia made a darkly witty reference to the idea of fleeing unrest with just the clothes on your back.

Styled by Malina Joseph Gilchrist\n\nYET THIS SPRING\u2019S fashions, more than in any era in living memory, seem inextricably linked to the times in which we live. They are hysterical, scatterbrained and lunging toward extreme opposites (glittery at Gucci, wasteland-era at Rick Owens) just as global political parties have become more polarized themselves. The collections telegraph post-national, post-history and post-internet ideas \u2014 all of which bear individual examination. The post-national is, perhaps, the easiest to connect to culture\u2019s current fixations: Eschewing borders as various governments seek to enforce them, fashion is, in a sense, evoking an aesthetic idyll, a leftist liberal dream in step with most fashion designers\u2019 sensibilities. The post-nationalism of fashion has emerged perhaps in response to the rise of the right wing \u2014 not only across America, but in much of Europe, too, where the notion of patriotism has been used as a Trojan Horse for prejudice and white supremacy.\n\nEqually, post-nationalism is a reaction to the ongoing furor around perceived cultural appropriation \u2014 when even a hairstyle can cause widespread outrage, as was the case with the dreadlocks worn by models at last spring\u2019s Marc Jacobs show, highlighting the politicization of black women\u2019s hair. Rather than the clich\u00e9d references of early 2000s fashion (and before), where collections could be readily and easily labeled \u201cAfrican,\u201d \u201cAsian\u201d or even \u201cFrench,\u201d the industry\u2019s boundaries have now almost dissolved. Jacobs\u2019s spring collection, for example, was a globalized, turbaned bricolage of different eras and locales, eluding facile categorization \u2014 an eccentric ancient-modern tribe beyond identification, a vision of a nativeless world, with a single culture created from the flotsam of many. And when a designer does flatten their inspiration into the now-old-fashioned adage of X meets Y (Queen Elizabeth plus Duke Ellington, say) it feels hopelessly dated. As for post-history, fashion is oft chastised for its reliance on retro ideas and is encouraged instead to look forward. But what if that outlook is bleak? Fashion\u2019s current point of view is hesitant, reluctant even, to think too much about the future.\n\nAs the line between true and false and right and wrong becomes disorientingly blurred, designers are challenging other norms \u2014 including the purpose of clothing itself. Mutated hybrids are emerging, the most extreme being Balenciaga\u2019s propositions of entirely separate garments \u2014 like denim jackets and trenches or opera coats and padded construction worker\u2019s vests \u2014 conjoined at the neck, leaving one or the other flapping over the front or flank, or Phoebe Philo\u2019s two-in-one trench coats for C\u00e9line, which are sewn together in an infinity loop at the bottom hem.\n\nAt Maison Margiela, John Galliano sliced his clothes apart with a technique he dubs \u201cd\u00e9cortiqu\u00e9\u201d (translation: \u201cpeeled\u201d or \u201cshelled\u201d), stripping the garment to a framework of ribbony seam allowance, with open space between. The concept rethinks a jacket\u2019s reason for being: It will no longer protect you from the elements, a previously essential component of a garment, that could, perhaps, become unnecessary due to the ever-rising mercury of climate change. Rick Owens\u2019s spring show had swollen, bulbous volumes erupting from various points on the torso, which, he said, scrambled familiar bodily shapes. Most everything he showed featured zipped pockets, transforming a piece of clothing into something more akin to a suit fit for a nomadic post-apocalyptic existence, an outfit for a world in which not only the idea of nation had become irrelevant, but that of home as well. With nowhere to store your belongings, you had to carry them with you.\n\nImage Rick Owens\u2019s protective, body-obscuring, heavily padded garments recalled tents, turtle shells and rucksacks: clothing for an era in which home is whatever you can carry with you.

Styled by Malina Joseph Gilchrist\n\nWalter Bradford Cannon, the physiologist who first coined the term \u201cfight or flight,\u201d observed that fear was the motivation for the latter and rage for the former \u2014 although both could be triggered by the same event. That seems to be the instinct of designers, too, caught (as are all of us) between fear for survival (of humanity, of themselves, or maybe just of their business) and raging against the machine. Rick Owens characterized his show as \u201ca gesture of turning away from threat, not really as escapism, but as rejection.\u201d Others were rather more fantastic \u2014 Alessandro Michele\u2019s Milanese Gucci show, for instance, with its gang of rootless rebels in glittering neo-folkloric dress traipsing a runway reimagined as a fabulist map of artifacts from the ancient world. (In reality, they were fakes shipped from the Cinecitt\u00e0 film studios in Rome.) Fight or flight, or fatalist versus fabulist, is the season\u2019s key message.\n\nBut how can you run from \u2014 or fight \u2014 an apocalypse? Apocalypse evokes the notion of worlds falling apart in spectacular, high Hollywood fashion \u2014 a flood, an asteroid, and existence being wiped out. Judgment Day. But perhaps the apocalypse we are approaching is, to a degree, a destruction of worlds rather than the world, a collapsing of established orders and ways of doing business. On a base, commercial level, the old rules of seasons and of male and female suddenly seem inapplicable, irrelevant \u2014 fashion labels are challenging gender binaries, eschewing retrospective styles, cultural cherry-picking and lazy luxury for something more fluid and less easily categorized.\n\nOwens cited the Italian poet and activist Filippo Tommaso Marinetti\u2019s \u201cManifesto of Futurism,\u201d written in 1909, as an inspiration for his show. \u201cThere are a few unfortunate attitudes in this manifesto regarding women and book burning,\u201d he said with his typical deadpan candor. \u201cBut what\u2019s fascinating about radical utopian movements is that they start with the best intentions but then degenerate and crumble. Until the next wave of hope appears over the horizon.\u201d\n\nModel: Achok at DNA Model Management. Hair by Adam Szabo at Frank Reps using Oribe.

That label is tongue-in-cheek, though just as Mary Shelley\u2019s fevered novel hints at societal fears of miscegenation and \u201cimpurity,\u201d the notion that these baked goods represent unholy unions suggests that there are clear borders in the culinary world that one ought not cross. Two centuries ago, the French led a shift from free-form cooking to codified techniques and built a system for achieving and recognizing mastery that still defines the professional kitchen, pastry or otherwise. So inevitably it\u2019s the croissant that\u2019s seen as being in danger of degradation: the noble, labor-intensive French pastry sullied by its union with the crude, arriviste American doughnut or muffin. (Another iteration was unveiled in January by Vive la Tarte in San Francisco: the tacro, a savory pork- or chicken-stuffed taco with a croissant shell.)\n\nPhoto\n\nYET THE CROISSANT itself was born of crossed borders. The butter-laden layered dough has roots in medieval Arab practice, and the pastry\u2019s shape comes from the Viennese kipferl, said to have been modeled after the Islamic crescent borne on the banners of 17th-century Ottoman invaders. (Although this back story is likely apocryphal, in 2013 a rebel stronghold in Syria banned croissants as symbols of colonialism.) Few dishes, let alone desserts, have remained static over time: Blancmange, a molded milk pudding, was once a chicken casserole; craggy coconut Italian-Jewish macaroons share ancestry (going back to early Sicilian pasta) with the polished round French macarons that have ruffled hems, which languished as solitary disks until someone sandwiched them around ganache a little over a century ago.\n\nIf anything, today\u2019s nouvelle pastries mark a return to the spirit championed by Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame, the early 19th-century forefather of French cooking, inventor of the souffl\u00e9 and the croquembouche and architect of monumental confectionery centerpieces that rose up to three feet \u2014 nearly as high as the sculptured hairstyles of his late namesake, Marie Antoinette, the Austrian princess whose own love for viennoiserie may have inspired the myth of her declaring, \u201cLet them eat cake.\u201d Car\u00eame has disciples in Paris today, including Christophe Adam, known for \u00e9clairs ornamented with edible silver, popcorn and Mona Lisa eyes; Jonathan Blot, conjurer of macarons that taste like bubble gum; and, of course, Pierre Herm\u00e9, who daubs raspberry-lychee p\u00e2t\u00e9 inside croissants and showers them with candied rose petals. Like the original viennoiserie, which were painstakingly elegant pastries designed for the Hapsburg court in imperial Vienna that eventually became indispensable to the city\u2019s sidewalks, their decadence is matched by the virtuosity of their construction and their element of surprise: They are, then as now, as much for beholding as for eating.\n\nTheir contemporary allure is aided by the diminishment of desserts at midrange restaurants, which after the recession of 2008 began to shed pastry chefs, unable to justify the expense for a course that yields little profit. As restaurant desserts have become simpler and homier \u2014 olive-oil cake, anything with chocolate \u2014 once plainspoken baked goods have turned rococo, offering an aura of luxury, enhanced by how difficult they are to procure before selling out each morning. At $4 to $8 each, these small but elaborate edifices seem worthier than the run-of-the-mill pastries available at every urban corner deli and curbside coffee cart, enabling their artisans to cover the ever-increasing cost of basic ingredients, particularly butter, whose price hit a historic high last year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIndeed, French butter, which has a higher percentage of fat and a pronounced tang from cultured cream, is so desirable across the globe, it\u2019s starting to disappear from grocery shelves in France. This is partly because more people are making pastries than ever before; as a French professor explained to The Economist in November, \u201cChina has discovered croissants.\u201d But if the trend continues, the croissant as we know it \u2014 a straightforward compact of butter, flour, milk, sugar, yeast and salt \u2014 may be no more. And in its place? These overgrown crescents too big to fit in the palm of the hand, spangled and swagged, glutted with fillings, arrayed like objets d\u2019art in austere concrete-walled patisseries where the bakers fuss like apothecaries. They\u2019re absurd until you try them: salty and sweet and shattering everywhere, leaving behind smears of cream and telltale butter fingerprints.

Moss and Getchell recently left New York and moved into a 1929 colonial revival house in a small Connecticut town. From there, they run a design and retail consulting firm, and on April 10 they will release a Rizzoli book reflecting on the impact of the Moss store. To mark the occasion, T sent Moss a Polaroid camera and asked him to photograph some of the many objects that decorate his home.\n\n\u201cThese photos were all taken on the morning of March 1,\u201d Moss explains of his images, below. Every morning he rises at around 4 a.m. and, after making tea, surveys and rearranges his objects \u2014 crystal glasses, a Nymphenburg porcelain bird. It\u2019s an activity born of both love and habit, he says. \u201cI always enjoyed doing this when we had the store and galleries \u2014 and I still do it, although it\u2019s now at home, and on a much smaller scale.\u201d\n\nImage Credit Murray Moss\n\nThe first cupboard I open each morning is the one with our Victorian china teapot in it.\n\nImage Credit Murray Moss\n\nOne of the niches for books that is built into a long wall in the living room, paneled with knotty alder wood.

{"title": "\n                    The Women Responsible for the Look of Your Next All-Day Cafe                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/12/t-magazine/design/mp-shift-anna-polonsky-amy-morris.html", "text": "Photo\n\nON A FALL afternoon at De Maria, a year-old restaurant in New York\u2019s NoLIta neighborhood, the flat city light pours in from a wall of windows onto square tables covered in worn pistachio-green and navy leather. Diners can sit on squat wooden chairs, a tan-leather banquette or felt-topped stools at the bar, which is lit by orblike pendants and backed by a Bauhaus-via-Brazil geometric tile mural. They might order a chai latte, which arrives in a stoneware mug made by Brooklyn\u2019s Workaday Handmade, or a cured-salmon and coconut grain bowl, off seasonal menus that are available from early in the morning until late at night.\n\nBeyond the virtuous food, the space itself is somehow salubrious, as if solely by being here you are improving your life. Along with places like Kismet in Los Angeles, June\u2019s All Day in Austin and Res Ipsa in Philadelphia, De Maria is part of a new class of American restaurants \u2014 or rather, \u201call-day cafes\u201d \u2014 that combine highly specific, instantly recognizable d\u00e9cor with visually pleasing riffs on health-store classics like flaxseed banana bread and acai. These new cafes, all of which owe a debt to New York\u2019s abstemious Dimes, which opened in Chinatown in 2013, present amiable aesthetic experiences that feel ready-made for Instagram: Many of these rooms share the same natural light, blond wood chairs and copper details that have come to evoke a kind of Scandinavian-inflected, aspirational millennial apartment, which the cafes themselves tend to resemble.\n\nDe Maria\u2019s interior, in particular, is the work of the MP Shift, a Chinatown-based design and branding studio that, since its founding three years ago, has created variations on this look for several New York City restaurants and is now expanding throughout the country \u2014 as well as to Paris, London and Sydney. The studio was established by Amy Morris and Anna Polonsky (the M and P of the name, plus shift as in \u201clate\u201d), who met a decade ago through mutual friends, when Morris was a marketing consultant and Polonsky was a managing partner at a culinary events company. The young chefs and restaurateurs they encountered in those jobs were often interested in developing independent projects but lacked the proper guidance, so the two women decided to build an agency that consolidated graphics, interiors and brand-direction.\n\nIf it\u2019s well established that we eat with our eyes, then the MP Shift is selling a related truth: In our digital age, a restaurant\u2019s interior must be as satiating as its food. Officially, Morris and Polonsky have little to do with what\u2019s on a client\u2019s menu (aside from its logo, typefaces and layout), but they have tended to partner with chefs who prefer serving things like cerulean spirulina smoothies and magenta-hued radicchio salads that feel intended for future snapshots. The plating, too, reflects an understanding of what appeals to these restaurants\u2019 intended psychographic: It\u2019s heavy on swooshes of creamy sauces and bright, clashing layers of tropical fruits or local vegetables in flattened, de Kooning-esque compositions, often rendered atop wide, shallow clay plates and bowls. The MP Shift doesn\u2019t tell the kitchen staff how to assemble their ingredients, but they don\u2019t need to; chefs these days must think as much like designers as they do cooks \u2014 indeed, their success depends upon it.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat the MP Shift does do is help ensure that this all-day fare remains visually appealing no matter the hour, while also providing a growing community of urban freelancers a sort of idealized living-room-as-office, allowing a public space to masquerade as a private one. \u201cIn the morning, everyone is on their laptop here; people are spending more time in restaurants as their third space,\u201d Morris says of De Maria, referencing a concept by the urban sociologist Ray Oldenburg, who argued in 1989\u2019s \u201cThe Great Good Place\u201d that communities thrive in social spaces beyond homes and offices. These days, she says, \u201cYou\u2019re asking for a restaurant to be more than just food.\u201d\n\nRESTAURANTS, OF COURSE, have always been about more than just the food, whether it was New York\u2019s Four Seasons, designed in the International Style by Philip Johnson and William Pahlmann in 1958, or the organic austerity of the French Laundry, opened in Napa County in 1978, which for decades has defined a particular indoor-outdoor Northern Californian reverie. Meals worth traveling for are usually complemented by service and d\u00e9cor that\u2019s meant to soothe, excite or even dazzle in person. But now that every diner has a camera in her handbag, restaurateurs have been forced to acknowledge that what they\u2019re creating is not just a place where people consume meals but an aspirational space that, for many who experience it, exists only online. So even casual cafes \u2014 the sort that the MP Shift often designs \u2014 have to be stunning and distinctive enough to woo potential diners.\n\nMorris and Polonsky\u2019s projects often reflect the idea that these places become most enticing when filled with the same global, minimalist details (imported tiles, Alvar Aalto stools, oak tables) that appeal when encountered on social media, whether in pictures of other restaurants, or even of homes or hotels. \u201cThey asked me to open a Pinterest account,\u201d says Gonzalo Go\u00fbt, the co-owner of Verde, an erstwhile salad counter in New York\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood, who hired the MP Shift in 2016. All of Verde\u2019s ingredients came from the farmer\u2019s market, so Go\u00fbt used his virtual mood board to create a look that \u201cconveyed that sense of the natural,\u201d he says. Following this exercise, Morris and Polonsky built a dramatic counter of triangular slices of green and pink marble, which also adorned the facade as terrazzo. The final touch was the logo, with the restaurant\u2019s name rendered in a fat, cheery pink-and-green sans serif.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nAs Morris and Polonsky\u2019s portfolio grows, new clients increasingly reach out because they want to replicate a detail that they\u2019ve seen only in photographs. In Houston, Kelly Barnhart will soon open Vibrant, an all-day cafe serving \u201cadaptogenic potions\u201d and grain salads out of a former laundromat. She was impressed with De Maria after seeing the space in a magazine, and brought the MP Shift on as consultants last spring. Working with Lake Flato, a local architecture firm, Barnhart plans to install long, leather-clad L-shaped banquettes, vintage Tobias Scarpa lamps and drawings by the New York artist Karin Haas, whose work abstracts patterns she finds in nature.\n\nThe room\u2019s look will probably feel familiar: comforting, even. But having become known for an identifiable style over the past few years, Morris and Polonsky are now at pains to escape its tyranny. Back at De Maria, Polonsky points out a geometrically patterned wall inspired by kintsugi (the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery with thin threads of lacquer mixed with precious metals) that they created by filling cracks within the restaurant\u2019s vintage subway tiles. Potential clients constantly request this motif, but Morris and Polonsky aren\u2019t interested in replicating it. Likewise, they avoid Prouv\u00e9 chairs and parti-colored Max Lamb marble. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy for our clients to say, \u2018We should do a pink place with midcentury chairs,\u2019 \u201d Morris says. \u201cBut we don\u2019t want them to fall into that trend. We don\u2019t want them to say, \u2018Let\u2019s put avocado toast on the menu.\u2019 \u201d\n\nInstead, one of the MP Shift\u2019s new European clients is adopting a primary-colored palette that seems inspired, in part, by another recent internet phenomenon: the resurgence of the designer Ettore Sottsass and his Memphis Group. At the forthcoming Parisian cafe Echo, the menus and logo will feature Crayola red, blue and yellow that suggest mid-80s Los Angeles. Morris and Polonsky predict Europe\u2019s next trend-driven restaurant interiors might include angular Serge Mouille sconces and chrome seating, Formica counters and linoleum floors; in this context, these mundane American surfaces would likely feel modern. Though soon enough they, too, will be retired, making way for a new aesthetic to serve a new generation of diners who need to rest their phone on a lambent tabletop, order a hemp-milk cortado and, perhaps, post a photo or two.", "keywords": ["allday", "yorks", "feel", "look", "polonsky", "morris", "shift", "space", "women", "mp", "clients", "restaurants", "cafe", "responsible", "maria"], "polarity": 0.08876471324818433, "subjectivity": 0.37001001753067864},

Most often she is a princess of the depths, with alabaster skin, a giant fin in place of legs and breasts covered by a mess of long, tangled hair. Her appeal, though, is not merely aesthetic. For centuries, men have braved the open waters, knowing full well they may never make it home, and the mermaid has served as either a kind of ballast in times of trouble, saving sailors from floods and deadly storms, or a figure of seduction, luring them to their deaths at the bottom of the ocean. Her passivity, as well as her beguiling exoticness, is an escape from whatever drudgery awaits these men back on land \u2014 the mermaid is a fantasy, yes, but also a way to explain the unexplainable in nature.

Their love also demonstrates a kind of compassion that feels profoundly absent right now.

Credit Domingo Milella\n\nSurrounded by the Baltic Sea, about 60 miles off the southeastern coast of Sweden\u2019s mainland, Gotland is the largest of the country\u2019s bucolic islands (which number well over 200,000), and one that has a seemingly split personality. In the short summer season \u2014 primarily July and August, when temperatures hover in the balmy 70s \u2014 revelers descend on this mostly wild, windswept and sparsely populated province for all-night partying and the rambunctious weeklong electronic music festival Stockholmsveckan. Outside of high season, though \u2014 and anywhere outside of its largest town, Visby (population: 24,300) \u2014 Gotland remains a rural paradise, popular with outdoorsy Stockholm professionals looking to escape city life by hiking along the island\u2019s craggy limestone cliffs and cycling past tiny clapboard fishing villages, crumbling medieval churches and 18th-century farmhouses. Several Stockholm-based architects have even chosen to build their own startlingly contemporary houses on the tradition-bound island.\n\nLately, Gotland has been attracting a growing stream of international visitors, too. Chalk it up to gloomy political and environmental forecasts if you will, but as travelers increasingly seek out pristine landscapes offering peace and quiet, the island presents the perfect retreat \u2014 just a 40-minute flight from Stockholm. Design-forward boutique hotels offer access to nature that doesn\u2019t require pitching a tent in the wilderness, and a clutch of remarkably good restaurants \u2014 serving fresh-caught Baltic fish and all manner of organic locally grown vegetables \u2014 show off the bounty of the surrounding farmland. Throw in a few charming craft-oriented Nordic design shops and an impressively large collection of museums for an island with a population of just 60,000, and you have a compelling reason to skip the mainland entirely.\n\nImage The Revolver Hotel in Visby, which is owned and decorated by the conceptual designer Ingela Tanaka Rohnstrom.

The wood-beamed interiors of the 18th-century farmhouse are endlessly photogenic, decorated with pastel floral wallpaper, sheepskin throw rugs and jugs of freshly picked wildflowers. During the summer, there are live folk music performances in the property\u2019s barn, and the traditionally Swedish restaurant \u2014 which uses produce from the hotel\u2019s own two-acre garden \u2014 is considered one of the best on Gotland.\n\nFabriken Furillen\n\nAn imposing former factory building on the site of an old limestone quarry might not sound particularly inviting, but photographer Johan Hellstrom had a vision for what it could become, and he turned this industrial patch of land into a high-end escape (about an hour\u2019s drive northeast of Visby) after purchasing the abandoned factory in 1999. The 19 guest rooms all have Hastens beds and a color scheme dominated by soothing grays and white, so there\u2019s nothing to detract from the natural, forested surroundings. For those who really want to detach, there\u2019s a \u201cHermit Cabin\u201d on the grounds \u2014 an isolated outpost (a 20-minute bike ride from the main building) with no running water, no Wi-Fi and free-roaming cows and sheep as your only neighbors.\n\nRevolver Hotel\n\nTucked into a quiet courtyard in central Visby, the three-year-old Revolver is an under-the-radar hotel option in Gotland\u2019s main town \u2014 there\u2019s no website and no outside signage, so word of mouth has been the main driver for bookings here. Quirky d\u00e9cor dominates \u2014 think sparkly golden bathroom tiles, vintage rotary phones as objets d\u2019art, and Fornasetti wallpaper depicting hot air balloons \u2014 all of it the singular vision of its owner, the conceptual designer Ingela Tanaka Rohnstrom.

The day\u2019s specials are written on a chalkboard at the entrance and often include baked perch with celeriac and truffle vinaigrette, lobster soup with black radish, and fried herring with spring onion butter and mashed potatoes. In warm weather, simple wooden tables are set up on the street outside \u2014 the ideal place to sip a glass of Chardonnay and watch the summer crowds pass by.\n\nKrakas Krog\n\nA 40-minute drive east across Gotland from Visby brings you to this hybrid restaurant and hotel in the middle of the Kr\u00e4klingbo countryside. There\u2019s a highly seasonal tasting menu of six to eight courses \u2014 regular ingredients include grilled beetroot, local lamb, and frogs\u2019 legs sourced from the nearby pond \u2014 all presented by one of the cooks in the spare, minimalist dining room. And with only one seating a night, there\u2019s a sense of special occasion that permeates dinners here. The three guest rooms are similarly simple and refined, all in varying shades of white, with wide-plank wood floors and fluffy down comforters.\n\nLilla Bjers\n\nThis 30-acre family-run farm on the outskirts of Visby is surrounded by vegetable fields and fruit orchards, from which it sources the ingredients for its organic, constantly changing menu. Everything from blueberries and currants to garlic and nine varieties of asparagus, as well as Christmas trees, are grown on the property. Dishes are a simple affair \u2014 think roasted lamb with pickled carrots and potatoes pulled straight from the earth \u2014 and a walk around the grounds before a meal is the best way to fully appreciate what you\u2019re about to eat. You can even meet the chickens that supply the kitchen\u2019s eggs. Dinner in the farm\u2019s atmospheric greenhouse can also be arranged, where you\u2019ll dine amid banana, fig and olive trees.\n\nImage Ceramics by Camilla Jensen, at her store C.

There\u2019s a whole room of vintage clothing (including original Levi\u2019s and Lee denim, wedding dresses and unusual sneakers), bicycles from the 1960s, kitschy decorative items like porcelain parrots, vinyl records and an array of giftable local items (Swedish candy, homemade soaps, specialty loose-leaf teas and herbs). 011-07-63-94-24-44\n\nImage From left: Visby Botanical Garden; the ruins of the 13th-century Church of St. Olaf.

Here, you\u2019ll find everything from the mummified remains of Stone Age islanders to medieval armor from the Danish invasion of 1361. It\u2019s a deep dive into Gotland\u2019s rugged, seafaring culture and why the island holds such a special place in the Swedish imagination.\n\nRelated: A Low-Key Swedish Island\u2019s Shockingly Modern Architecture", "keywords": ["visby", "rural", "theres", "main", "gotland", "islands", "swedish", "paradise", "coast", "hotel", "credit", "restaurant", "guide", "jensen"], "polarity": 0.11282022607022606, "subjectivity": 0.37043004680504665},

What, then, explains its recent crop of contemporary residences?\n\nImage The minimalist plaster box that serves as architect Bolle Tham\u2019s vacation home rises from a ridge above one of Gotland\u2019s stony beaches. Credit Mikael Olsson\n\nTHE DANISH-NORWEGIAN WRITER Aksel Sandemose was a minor literary figure, a notorious crank, when he wrote the 1933 novel containing a set of commandments that would become one of Scandinavia\u2019s defining social texts. \u201cA Fugitive Crosses His Tracks\u201d is a barely veiled send-up of his hometown, Nykobing Mors (renamed Jante) and an uncomfortably close-to-the-bone satire of Nordic conformity. Jante is governed by the \u201cLaw of Jante,\u201d rules for living that reflect both Scandinavia\u2019s ethnic homogeneity and its long-held belief that people are happier when both pleasure and pain are spread among all citizens:\n\nYou shall not believe that you are someone.\n\nYou shall not believe that you are as good as we are.\n\nYou shall not believe that you are any wiser than we are.\n\nYou shall never indulge in the conceit of imagining that you are better than we are.\n\nYou shall not believe that you know more than we do.\n\nYou shall not believe that you are more important than we are.\n\nYou shall not believe that you are going to amount to anything.\n\nYou shall not laugh at us.\n\nYou shall not believe that anyone cares about you.\n\nYou shall not believe that you can teach us anything.\n\nThese days, Scandinavians bristle at the mention of the Law of Jante. Such stereotypes, they insist, no longer have such a stronghold in a modern world, one where Stockholm now leads in billion-dollar technology companies per capita, second only to Silicon Valley.\n\nYet it is hard not to think of Sandemose as you drive along the winter-deserted roads of Gotland, Sweden\u2019s largest island, a 40-minute flight south from Stockholm. About the size of Long Island and flat as a soccer field, it is the country\u2019s sunniest locale. (Admittedly, that doesn\u2019t say much in a place that spends most of the year in frigid darkness.) And along with Faro, its companion island off its northern tip, it is forever associated with the director Ingmar Bergman, who set many of his greatest films here and lived in Faro for the last decades of his life. In July and early August, Gotland is a tourist mecca; young professionals, starved for heat and light, party in the beer gardens of Visby, a port town of 24,300. An hour or two away, up and down the coasts, are the summer houses of the country\u2019s politicians and business executives, fronting beaches dotted with rauks \u2014 gigantic, craggy sculptural formations unique to the area, as ghostly as something from Stonehenge, created by ice-age reef erosions. Scarlet poppies and brilliant blue viper\u2019s bugloss carpet the meadows and line the roadside ditches.\n\nImage The director Ingmar Bergman\u2019s study, preserved as part of a retreat for artists and writers on the island of Faro, north of Gotland. Credit Mikael Olsson\n\nBut by late August, tourist season is over. There is no gradual wind-down here, just a sudden deflation, like the circus pulling up stakes in a rush. Unlike the Stockholm Archipelago, a set of islands near the capital that Swedes visit year-round, Gotland seems to disappear like Brigadoon. A number of restaurants and inns outside of Visby, including the minimalist 19-suite Fabriken Furillen, owned by the former photographer Johan Hellstrom, shut down, and the flora dies as well, laying bare the local architecture. So stripped-down and uniform are the farmhouses of Gotland\u2019s interior, no matter what century they were built in they seem to have been drawn by a 5-year-old: rectangles topped with triangular roofs, each with a plain door and a few tiny frameless windows. The summer cottages along the largely unmarked roads are also free of embellishment: low-slung bungalows painted a familiar Falu red, the auburn-hued weather-resistant oil pigment derived from the copper mines of Dalarna, in central Sweden, during the 16th century. \u201cPeople have always come to Gotland to get back to tradition and nature,\u201d says Joel Phersson, a 35-year-old architect who works and lives on the island. \u201cIf you were to tell your friends in Stockholm that you\u2019re going to your family\u2019s vacation house here, you\u2019d perhaps be telegraphing that you are well off but very low-key. Ostentation is a high crime.\u201d\n\nBut recently, a generation of homeowners and architects, including Phersson\u2019s firm Skalso, have started not just ignoring, but defying the Law of Jante. Working around restrictive zoning laws that prioritize \u201cprotection and preservation\u201d of the island, which was settled more than 9,000 years ago as an agricultural hub, they have spent the last decade building contemporary houses as distinctive as the topography. From cast-concrete bunkers to glass-framed aeries, the new houses shock, subverting long-established order with a cool blast of modernity, while also paying homage to the island\u2019s chilly dignity.\n\nImage At left, the residence by married architects Hans Murman and Ulla Alberts is wrapped in a scrim printed with life-size photographs of the surrounding juniper trees.

Credit Mikael Olsson\n\nHANS MURMAN AND his wife, Ulla Alberts, architects who own a firm in Stockholm that often designs health spas, were in a perfect position to experiment on Gotland. The secluded parcel on which they built their Juniper House is owned by Alberts\u2019s family; she spent barefoot summers in her parents\u2019 still-standing red cottage. Before conceptualizing their own house, the couple designed a number of structures for relatives on the 2.2-acre plot, inadvertently creating a sort of stages-of-man evolutionary chart of their aesthetic. In addition to a studio that they made as newlyweds \u2014 little more than a shack \u2014 the property includes her brother\u2019s unadorned two-story limestone farmhouse built in 2002 from plans that the 54-year-old Alberts drafted in architecture school, as well as a 1,700-square-foot, midcentury-inflected villa with a peaked wooden roof and bright orange accents that the couple finished in 2014 for Ulla\u2019s sister. Over a decade ago, they completed the home that would become their ultimate statement, a dwelling in dialogue with the thicket of 15-foot juniper trees in which it hides. To create its innovative cladding, the 71-year-old Murman photographed the conifers, then had the images transposed in 1:1 scale onto a vinyl scrim. The mural wraps around the building\u2019s wooden exterior on a galvanized steel frame about two feet from the walls. The house, a mere 540 square feet puzzled out with the ingenuity of a yacht to accommodate their two sons, recedes into the forest during the day \u2014 somewhat of a poke to local officials who fretted that a modern structure would mar the landscape \u2014 yet glows at night like a botanical Noguchi lantern. \u201cWe are in our own world here,\u201d Murman says. \u201cAmong these houses there is every era, every generation. Just walking around you can travel through time.\u201d\n\nA 45-minute drive away, past a weathered windmill and fields of sheep fat with winter wool, Asa Myrdal Bratt has come from the mainland to meet me at her house. Built right on a rarely traveled road, it seems to rise from an empty field like a giant charred barn after a merciless prairie fire. That is precisely the effect that Stockholm-based architect Jens Enflo was seeking when his firm built it in collaboration with Deve Architects several years ago: \u201cI wanted it to seem as though the land was just growing all the way through it,\u201d the 42-year-old Enflo says. Clad in nearly black stained pine, a hue virtually unseen on Gotland and one that suggests shou sugi ban, the ancient Japanese burnt-timber treatment, the structure plays with proportion and transparency in a painterly way, contrasting against the flat, tree-void site. Almost 80 feet long but just under 15 feet wide, with a peaked 22-foot ceiling and a single lofted bedroom, the house\u2019s front and back walls are partially glass, as are most of its interior walls; the central area between the living room and the small guest wing holds a covered courtyard, completing the illusion of a raw, skeletal frame. Myrdal Bratt \u2014 a brand consultant in her 50s, who, with her husband, a doctor, bought the house in 2014 \u2014 says that the place is warm, even cozy, despite its openness; from the outside, it appears provocatively barren, a stripped-down interpretation of the working livestock barns that you can see in the distance.\n\nImage Gotland\u2019s typically flat meadowland seems to flow through the barnlike house created by Jens Enflo\u2019s firm and Deve Architects. Credit Mikael Olsson\n\nNOT ALL OF the several dozen modern houses on Gotland are entirely at peace with the island\u2019s natural and agricultural history; some, in fact, actively challenge the surrounding landscape. Consider the harshly reductive house that the 48-year-old architect Bolle Tham\u2019s firm built for his family: From the outside it resembles army barracks, with an exterior of local plaster, colored with carbon and troweled smooth atop a masonry core. Inside, all of the rooms face a central courtyard, giving it a snug, insular feel, though there are several wall-size windows that swing out like barn doors on summer days. Although it\u2019s one level, some of the rooms demand several steps \u2014 a necessary design quirk after Tham resisted blasting the underlying rock to lay a uniform slab; he felt the house should follow the landscape\u2019s topography. The living areas are nearly naked, the bedrooms cell-like, the finishes plywood. \u201cGotland\u2019s vacation homes had become clich\u00e9, so we thought it was time to do something that wasn\u2019t a replica of an old limestone farmhouse,\u201d he says. \u201cWe wanted to be in conversation with the past, but not just repeat it.\u201d\n\nStill, Tham\u2019s shed-like edifice seems recessive, even humble, compared with a collection of homes being built on the island\u2019s Bungenas peninsula, a few miles from the seven-minute ferry to Faro. In 2007, the 49-year-old real-estate developer Joachim Kuylenstierna bought a gated 400 acres that had originally been a quarry and then, during the Cold War, the site for 100 bunkers.\n\nThere are now more than 30 homes on Bungenas, in addition to a coffee house, a six-room hotel and a concert venue converted from an old barn. All the businesses and a majority of the homes have been designed by Skalso, the firm Kuylenstierna founded with Phersson and his fellow architect, the 38-year-old Erik Gardell, because there wasn\u2019t anyone on the island who could shape the sort of avant-garde vacation community they desired. The commune alludes to the Sea Ranch, the meticulously planned 1960s utopia in Northern California \u2014 albeit modified to include Gotland\u2019s bunkers, some of which Skalso modernized by scooping out enough earth on one side to allow for an entry, making them a kind of Swedish hobbit dwelling. Most of these subterranean residences, which owners tend to furnish with a sparseness that borders on clinical, are less than 600 square feet, a size that the economical Swedes deem sufficient for a family of four.\n\nImage To follow the natural curve of the land and avoid blasting into dense rock, Tham, the architect, designed the concrete floors of his near-bare dwelling to rise and fall from room to room. Credit Mikael Olsson\n\nBut one owner, a Swedish industrialist who bought one of the largest bunkers in the development six years ago, asked Skalso to take the firm\u2019s concept to astonishing depths, both aesthetically and literally. On approach, his house appears to be a one-story ultra-Brutalist box, made from concrete \u2014 a material rarely used for houses on Gotland \u2014 that had been poured into wooden molds to lend it a grain. Yet the 1,300-square-foot building that\u2019s visible above ground, which includes hushed, honed public spaces in dark wood, a welded metal kitchen and two minimalist bedrooms, represents less than a fifth of the total living space: The rest is beneath grade, on three floors, descending nearly 50 feet.\n\nThe excavation and underground construction process felt like laboring in the mines. Skalso preserved and exposed as much of the original concrete structure as possible, connecting a series of high-ceilinged, lavishly spare, skillfully lit rooms with a spiral, matte-black steel staircase. In addition to a vast dining room, there is a large, round marble-lined hammam installed in a former missile silo; the sky is visible through a glass porthole three flights above. Next to it is a \u201cspa\u201d with custom rubber sofas. Despite how sleek and chillingly soundproof the place is \u2014 you half-expect to hear muffled screams from somewhere in the depths \u2014 the owners, who, incongruously, have two young children, are clearly aware of their house\u2019s inherent drama: In a niche along one of the subterranean corridors, Skalso added a metal shelving unit stacked with cans of baked beans and bottled water, a wink to contemporary survivalist clich\u00e9s.\n\nIt is an extreme way to live, but in the end Gotland, despite its reputation for placid beauty, is pretty extreme itself: remote and wind-whipped and fierce \u2014 with, finally, a corresponding architecture. There are more contemporary houses in the works on the island over the next decade, including a streamlined enclave of a dozen on the island\u2019s northeast inlet anchored by the Fabriken Furillen inn. The Law of Jante, it turns out, especially its final tenet \u2014 \u201cYou shall not believe you can teach us anything\u201d \u2014 is no longer true here, amid the quiet farmhouses, the monochrome of Falu red, the biblical sky that never ends. Subversion, it seems, takes its most intriguing form when there is something beautiful and pure to bend. \u201cYou need the right background to change the way people think,\u201d Enflo had said, staring out at the field from the wide-open house he designed. \u201cIt\u2019s that contrast that makes you free.\u201d\n\nRelated:\n\nA Guide to Gotland, a Rural Paradise Off the Swedish Coast\n\nWhere the Swedes Go to Be (Really) Alone\n\nCold Comfort at the Edge of the World\n\nNot All Scandinavian Design is Minimalist\n\nBornholm: Crafts and Sunshine on the Danish Isle\n\nNancy Hass is the writer at large for T Magazine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["houses", "islands", "shockingly", "house", "firm", "gotland", "built", "jante", "swedish", "architecture", "modern", "shall", "believe", "island", "skalso", "lowkey"], "polarity": 0.07554829927906855, "subjectivity": 0.43524690978537145}
