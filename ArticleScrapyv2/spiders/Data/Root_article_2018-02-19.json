We have to make that clear. She is (more than likely) not running!\n\nOf course, she can if she wants to. Because she\u2019s Oprah and if Oprah says \u201cHey y\u2019all. I want to do this thing\u201d you don\u2019t say \u201cNo Oprah, you can not do this thing you want to do.\u201d Even if you happen to be making Oprah an omelet for some reason, and she says she\u2019d like feta cheese, peanut butter, and Frosted Flakes on said omelet, you don\u2019t say \u201cNo Oprah. That would be terrible idea.\u201d Because Oprah would make it work. And then have you ordering and eating cereal omelets.\n\nAnyway, Donald Trump\u2019s recent tweets, where he called Oprah \u201cinsecure\u201d and challenged her to run against him, might either be the smartest or the dumbest thing he\u2019s done in office. It\u2019s obvious why it would be the dumbest. Oprah would kick his ass. Now, whether she\u2019d actually be a good president \u2014 and whether we\u2019d actually want someone we love to be in that terrible position again \u2014 is debatable. But she\u2019d beat the bone spurs out of that motherfucker. I\u2019d say she\u2019d beat him to the white meat, but I think that once you break Trump\u2019s skin, Tang spills out.\n\nSo how, you ask, could this have possibly been a \u201csmart\u201d strategy? Well, if Oprah has no intentions on running (AND SHE ALLEGEDLY DOESN\u2019T) he\u2019s challenging someone he knows isn\u2019t interested in running against him. Like a little brother pushing his big brother, knowing that the big brother (probably) won\u2019t hit him back. Although this is a bitch-ass dog-whistle to his base, it does communicate a fearlessness, which they\u2019ll drink up like MAGA-flavored Mountain Dew.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this \u201cshow of strength\u201d only matters if he doesn\u2019t get mollywhopped in 2020 by a black woman from Chicago who\u2019s better, smarter, and richer than he is. Unfortunately, that\u2019s a moot point.

But what happens when Oprah calls? The Glow Up asked writer Tayari Jones, who got the call from the great and powerful O in October when her latest novel, An American Marriage, was chosen as the first Oprah\u2019s Book Club selection of 2018.\n\n\n\nSo what does Oprah say when she calls to give someone life-changing news?\n\n\u201cShe says, \u2018Hi, this is Oprah.\u2019 That\u2019s what she says,\u201d Jones said, laughing. \u201cAnd then she politely waits for you to get your whole freakout on. She patiently waits and then, when she\u2019s decided that\u2019s enough freakout time, she gets on to business.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cbusiness\u201d is a major breakthrough for Jones, whose first novel, Leaving Atlanta, won the 2003 Hurston/Wright Legacy Award for Debut Fiction. Crafting An American Marriage, which debuted last week to critical acclaim, was a slow and arduous journey, spanning six of the seven years since her last (also critically acclaimed) novel, Silver Sparrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI thought I couldn\u2019t work this book out,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI thought I\u2019d chosen a project that was too emotionally and morally ambitious, and I couldn\u2019t work it out.\u201d\n\nHer journey began with a desire to engage more of the issues of the day in her writing\u2014specifically issues surrounding wrongful incarceration, which she researched extensively during a fellowship at the Radcliffe Institute at Harvard in 2011. But though she became informed, she says she didn\u2019t feel inspired:\n\n\n\nIt didn\u2019t spark me as an artist, and I think it\u2019s because when it comes to issues like wrongful incarceration, there\u2019s only one side to that story. There\u2019s no other side to it; it\u2019s just wrong. And something with only one side, to me, is not dynamic enough to support 300 pages of a novel; you need ambiguity, you need adventure, you need\u2014just so many things\u2014but I didn\u2019t have any of those things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut inspiration often comes in unlikely places. For Jones, it arrived in a mall food court in her native Atlanta when she overheard a couple arguing at a nearby table. Jones took note of the physical differences between the two\u2014the woman was very well put-together, clearly doing better than the man with whom she was engaged in a heart-wrenching discussion within earshot of Jones:\n\nShe said, \u201cRoy, you know you wouldn\u2019t have waited on me for seven years.\u201d And he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you talkin\u2019 about; this shit wouldn\u2019t have happened to you in the first place\u201d... and I thought, that is really, in many ways, the heart of the African-American man-woman disconnect. He needs from her this kind of unconditional support, and she doesn\u2019t believe that if the tables were turned that he would behave the same way. And he feels like, \u201cThese tables don\u2019t turn, so it\u2019s moot!\u201d And I just felt like both of them deserved a full story, and that\u2019s how I started.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat that overheard conversation inspired is a beautiful and sometimes brutally honest novel about love, loss, hope, redemption, the secrets we keep from those we claim to love, and what Jones feels is the fundamental disconnect and danger facing black heterosexual relationships in a country so deeply invested in both racism and the prison-industrial complex\u2014and, consequently, the effects of wrongful incarceration on relationships, as Jones explained to The Glow Up: \u201cI\u2019m really curious about the residual effects; about what we owe one another; about the way this affects gender dynamics in our community.\u201d\n\nThe title of An American Marriage refers to the union of Roy and Celestial, an upwardly mobile African-American couple whose young marriage is ripped apart by wrongful incarceration\u2014a misidentification that Roy pays for with years of his innocent life.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat ensues during those years confronts the reader\u2019s most deeply held beliefs about fidelity, obligation and, most important, love. It also addresses the paradox that can be created when the deep inequities in our justice system intersect with the double standards that often permeate our relationships.\n\nOriginally writing from Celestial\u2019s point of view as a prisoner\u2019s wife, Jones found that her character\u2019s choices and behavior didn\u2019t meet early readers\u2019 expectations. \u201cEveryone [was] upset at the mere concept of this book,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s so often the case when it comes to people looking at women\u2019s responsibilities. Any time you deviate from what they consider to be the norm, then it\u2019s over. There\u2019s so little room for her to be respected in her choices.\u201d\n\n\n\nChanging course, she attempted the story from Roy\u2019s perspective as an innocent man behind bars. \u201cWhen I came at it from his point of view, it was more conventional,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel challenging enough, and that\u2019s when I decided to write it from all of their points of view, because you want your book to add to the conversation, not just reiterate a conversation that\u2019s already happened.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe result is a will-they-or-won\u2019t-they story told through the lens of not only Roy and Celestial but also members of their immediate family and close friend Andre, who occupies one corner of a love triangle that has perhaps always existed in the couples\u2019s relationship\u2014a relationship complicated by race, disrupted by time and perhaps always destined to challenge convention, as Jones discovered in the writing:\n\nThere are so many novels by white women that involve women trying to break free of the bounds of tradition, but I realized that in the white women\u2019s novels, the man is not in any trouble. So when she frees herself or changes the terms of her marriage, or what have you, because the man isn\u2019t in trouble, you don\u2019t worry about him, so her freedom isn\u2019t tied to anyone else. But with the black situation, the man is in trouble, so that if you reprioritize where his safety is not the first thing, or his care is not the first thing or the only thing on your list, there are consequences, because he actually needs you. And that is what makes Celestial\u2019s situation so complicated, but it\u2019s what makes it different than those other books.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while the characters Jones has created are realistically flawed, there are no true villains in An American Marriage, only different interpretations of a tragic situation. That ambiguity is what makes the narrative so intriguing from start to finish\u2014though Jones almost didn\u2019t finish, finding herself \u201cstranded\u201d 50 pages from the end. She even began considering career paths other than her role as a professor at Rutgers University because \u201cthree-quarters of a book is the same as no book at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt like I was in a boat,\u201d she said. \u201cI could see the shore, and I could not get there. Like, someone had stolen my oar, and it was very frustrating.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough An American Marriage is Jones\u2019 fourth published work, she is very clear on the fact that the writing process is overwhelming, especially if you aren\u2019t able to dedicate yourself to it full time.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey always tell writers, \u2018Oh, you should write every day,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that people need to stop saying that, because I feel that it\u2019s discouraging to busy people\u2014you know, to people who work\u2014working people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones wrote her first book on a desk in her clothes closet\u2014with the clothes still hanging there. She stresses that patience is key: \u201cIf you can put in an hour three times a week, you can write your book. It\u2019ll take you longer, but I just think it\u2019s consistency, and you\u2019ll get it done.\u201d\n\nJones should know; An American Marriage is a six-year labor of love that is well-deserving of the mounting accolades it\u2019s receiving. But it\u2019s a triumph Jones readily shares with the community that has sustained her throughout her writing career:\n\nYou know what has been really delightful about this experience? You know, I\u2019ve been writing a long time, and it\u2019s been beautiful to share this with the people who were reading me all the time. I feel like we did this together. I feel like this victory is ours together. Black women, we don\u2019t throw our people away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as we ended our conversation, Jones also made sure to share the words of her longtime mentor, acclaimed writer and playwright Pearl Cleage:", "keywords": ["thats", "novel", "man", "tayari", "love", "matter", "jones", "heart", "didnt", "american", "marriage", "gets", "know", "book"], "polarity": 0.11714598997493736, "subjectivity": 0.5294200779727095},

An acknowledged survivor of sexual assault herself, Oprah viewed this moment as a culmination of so many stories, catalyzed by a few not-so-good men:\n\nEverything that\u2019s happened has brought us to this point in time. We\u2019ve been working our way through a lot of repressed pain, anger, shame, and disappointment. And we weren\u2019t honoring our own voices.

It\u2019s just fascinating to me because I always try to look at things from thousands of feet above. . . It has seared into the consciousness a level of awareness that was not there before. That\u2019s the most important thing to me.

In doing so, they make the American Dream seem attainable. If we just fix ourselves, we can achieve our goals. For some people, the American dream is attainable, but to understand the chances for everyone, we need to look dispassionately at the factors that shape success. . . .\u201d\n\nFor Lithwick, writing for Slate, such contemplation might be beside the point. \u201cI have no idea whether Winfrey plans to run for the Oval Office in 2020,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAccording to reports, she is \u2018actively\u2019 considering it.

It is very hard for large and powerful institutions to undermine their own power and authority. Foucault noted that in his writings. The status-quo is quite comfortable for an institution. Is there an incentive for tribal government to present a perfect image of itself? Absolutely. Does this present an incentive to fudge the facts? It absolutely does. Newsletters are for tribal-programs. Tribal-governments should work with the independent media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor me, it is always important to be clear, I do not believe our elected officials are inherently corrupt, nor do I believe that the creation of this publication was brought about with nefarious intent. What I do believe is that tribal officials must create systems within our government that will foster transparency and accountability. The only way this can be done is by helping our elected officials and program heads to be more accessible to the media. I am giving away some industry secrets, but the functionality of our tribal government is that important.\n\n\u201cA more effective method of delivering information about the inner workings of any institution is through [unbiased] third-party journalists who are working for established media outlets. . . .\u201d\n\nShort Takes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupport Journal-isms Go Fund Me page.\n\nJoin the list of supporters.\n\nRichard Prince\u2019s Journal-isms originates from Washington.

Oprah coming in after Obama would\u2019ve been ideal, and I think that she may have been considering it, but she was trying to give Hillary Clinton her shine, and I get that. But Oprah deserves more than inheriting a busted America with a broken economy, or the threat of a nuclear war, with an emboldened white supremacist army dressed in khakis and wielding tiki torches.\n\nShe or Gayle King (who would surely be her chief of staff) would have to have a sit-down with Kim Jong Un and Iyanla Vanzant to repair the damage this president has done. You know that she\u2019d have to get a corporate sponsor to donate tons of free swag to make shit right with the United Nations. I also know that Freestyle Taco Tuesday night at the White House would be lit, and so would the Easter Egg Roll, but it isn\u2019t worth losing one of America\u2019s treasures to try to undo the damage that this flagrantly white, white man has done.\n\nFormer White House press secretary Sean Spicer doesn\u2019t believe that Oprah has the political infrastructure for a successful presidential run. Not only is he wrong, but this is coming from a man who became so disheveled trying to cover for all of the current president\u2019s bullshit that he once left the White House wearing mismatched shoes. Besides, what political infrastructure did Trump have when he decided to run for office? Tweets about politics don\u2019t count, and currently there is an actual debate as to whether or not the current president of the United States is even literate.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOprah could win, easily. Because Oprah could pull the 53 percent of secretly racist white woman who voted for Trump. When those white women claim that they have a black friend, they are talking about Oprah. Those are the women who betrayed their own interests and black America, and those women love them some Oprah.\n\nI know that the idea of an Oprah-and-Sen. Kamala Harris or Oprah-and-Rep. Maxine Waters ticket is fun, but think about the heavy lifting that Oprah would have to take on and ask yourself: In addition to trying to get us to eat better, love ourselves more and inspire us to live our best lives, should she really be responsible for balancing the budget, pulling us out of our national debt and playing nice with old white, racist senators? Seems like too much to ask, even of Oprah.\n\nShe could handle it, but should she have to?", "keywords": ["run", "dont", "ask", "americas", "oprah", "speech", "president", "women", "mess", "house", "white", "clean", "know", "presidents", "mammy", "idea"], "polarity": 0.13202241476224028, "subjectivity": 0.4332039246283432},

If not for the relentless efforts of such organizations as the African American Policy Forum, the Black Women\u2019s Blueprint and OKC Artists for Justice, Holtzclaw\u2019s crimes may have flown under the radar, which is too often the case when black women are victims of heinous crimes.\n\nThough I was thrilled to see Holtzclaw shaking and crying in court like the cowardly predator that he is, and happy for the women who did receive some validation in a court of law that their lives mattered, he should have never felt comfortable enough to prey on them in the first place. But this country teaches men\u2014with power and without\u2014that black women are disposable.\n\nEven with the unexpected verdict, though, I could not stop thinking about the five women who were told that their pain, their suffering, their trauma, meant nothing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could not stop thinking about Recy Taylor and Gertrude Perkins.\n\nRecy Taylor was 24 years old on Sept. 3, 1944, when she was abducted, blindfolded and gang-raped by six white supremacists in Abbeville, Ala. She was walking home from church with her friend Fannie Daniel and Daniel\u2019s son, West, when a green Chevrolet that had circled the street several times finally pulled alongside them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeven white men forced Taylor into the vehicle at gunpoint; one of them, Billy Howerton, would later say that he didn\u2019t participate in the rape because he knew Taylor, the New York Times reports.\n\nTaylor, who died Dec. 27 at 97 years old, told her story to NPR\u2019s Michel Martin in 2011:\n\n\n\nWe went on to church and came back. A car running around outside of us, six young men jumped out with a gun and said that\u2014you\u2019re the one that cut a white boy in Clarkton. And the police got us out looking for you. You get in the car and we will take you uptown to the police station. And they got me in the car and carried me straight through the woods, but before they go where they was going, they blindfolded me. After they messed over and did what they were going to do me, say, we\u2019re going to take you back. We\u2019re going to put you out. But if you tell it, we\u2019re going to kill you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a 2011 interview with The Root, Taylor talked about the loud silence smothering her pain.\n\n\n\n\u201cWasn\u2019t nothing done about it,\u201d Taylor, then 91, said. \u201cThe sheriff never even said he was sorry it happened. I think more people should know about it \u2026 but ain\u2019t nobody [in Abbeville] saying nothing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sheriff, George H. Gamble, didn\u2019t say he was sorry because he wasn\u2019t.\n\n\n\nThere was only one vehicle in Abbeville that matched the description of Taylor\u2019s assailants, one belonging to Hugo Wilson. Upon being \u201cquestioned\u201d by Gamble, Wilson said that he, Herbert Lovett, Dillard York, Luther Lee, Willie Joe Culpepper and Robert Gamble (relation to Sheriff Gamble unknown) all \u201chad intercourse with her,\u201d but he insisted that she was a prostitute\u2014and Gamble sent him home, the New York Times reports.\n\nThe night after she was raped, the home that Taylor shared with her husband and 3-year-old daughter was firebombed.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAfter that, they moved in with us,\u201d Benny Corbitt, Taylor\u2019s brother, told The Root. \u201cAt night, my father would sit in a tree and guard the house with a shotgun.\u201d\n\n\n\nEnter: Rosa Parks.\n\n\n\nDespite what whitewashed history books would have us believe, Rosa Parks\u2019 radical action on Dec. 1, 1955, was neither random nor spontaneous. She was not simply a tired seamstress too exhausted to give up her seat on a Montgomery, Ala., bus to a white man; she was a veteran organizer and activist on a mission.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClaudette Colvin, then 15, had refused to give up her seat on the bus to a white woman nine months prior to Parks. For daring to be free, Colvin was thrown off the bus and arrested, but she didn\u2019t become the face of the movement. Instead, she found herself shunned by her community, alone and pregnant.\n\n\u201c[Rosa Parks\u2019] skin texture was the kind that people associate with the middle class,\u201d Colvin said in a 2009 NPR interview. \u201cShe fit that profile.\u201d\n\nIn addition, as the secretary of the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP, Parks was well-known, well-respected and an \u201cinherently impressive person,\u201d historian David Garrow, the author of Bearing the Cross: Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, told NPR.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ruthless disregard with which movement leaders treated Colvin should not be erased, as it mirrors how those deemed \u201cimperfect victims\u201d are often sidelined today; neither should the fact that Parks used every ounce of her class and color privilege for her people\u2014and, perhaps, to free a younger version of herself.\n\nIn 1931, when she was 18 years old, Parks was the victim of an attempted rape. \u201cMr. Charlie,\u201d as she referred to him, was a white neighbor who employed young Rosa in his home snd tried to force himself on her, and she described her feelings in detail in a letter that was discovered in 2011.\n\n\u201cI was trapped and helpless,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI was hurt and sickened through with anger and disgust.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps Parks\u2019 personal experience led her down the path to becoming the fierce advocate for justice that she would become. Long before she set foot on that Montgomery bus, she had been fighting for black women who were raped, sexually assaulted and harassed by white supremacists in the Deep South and documenting their stories. The Montgomery busing system was the site not just of racial terror but for racialized sexual abuse as well.\n\n\n\nParks knew that.\n\nAs Danielle McGuire, historian and author of Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape and Resistance\u2014A New History of the Civil Rights Movement from Rosa Parks to the Rise of Black Power, notes:\n\n\n\nOther than police officers, few were as guilty of committing acts of racist violence and sexual harassment of black women as Montgomery\u2019s bus operators, who bullied and brutalized black passengers daily. Worse, bus drivers had police power. They carried blackjacks and guns, and they assaulted and sometimes even killed African Americans who refused to abide by the racial order of Jim Crow. In 1953 alone, African Americans filed over thirty formal complaints of abuse and mistreatment on the buses. Most came from working-class black women, mainly domestics, who made up nearly 70% of the bus ridership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParks knew exactly what she doing in 1955, just as she did in 1944, when, at 31 years old, she went to Abbeville to investigate the brutal rape of Recy Taylor.\n\n\n\nIn 1944, after meeting with Taylor and hearing her story firsthand, Parks formed the Committee for Equal Justice for the Rights of Mrs. Recy Taylor, a campaign that soon garnered support from activists, organizers and writers such as Mary Church Terrell, Langston Hughes and W.E.B. Du Bois. Before it was all said and done, there were Recy Taylor groups all across the country.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Chicago Defender called it \u201cthe strongest campaign for equal justice to be seen in a decade,\u201d yet it is barely spoken about today. Taylor died never receiving justice because two all-white, all-male juries refused to indict her rapists.\n\nIn 1949, five years after Taylor was abducted and raped, Gertrude Perkins was walking home from a party in Montgomery, Ala., when she was abducted and raped by two white police officers.\n\n\n\nThe officers accused her of \u201cpublic drunkenness,\u201d pushed her into the back of their squad car and drove her to a railroad embankment, where they raped her behind a building. Perkins was then dumped at a bus stop and warned to keep her mouth shut.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosa Parks also fought for justice for Perkins, forming the Citizens Committee for Gertrude Perkins, patterned after the campaign she spearheaded for Recy Taylor.\n\nPerkins, like Taylor, never received justice.\n\n\n\nMcGuire, who details both Perkins\u2019 and Taylor\u2019s stories in Dark End of the Street, reported that authorities \u201crefused to hold a line-up or issue any warrants since, according to the mayor, it would \u2018violate the Constitutional rights\u2019 of the police. Besides, he said, \u2018my policemen would not do a thing like that.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike Taylor, Perkins\u2019 reputation was maligned, her life was threatened, and her attackers\u2014standing boldly in plain sight, shielded by their whiteness and badges, never suffered any consequences.\n\nJust as whitewashed school books didn\u2019t teach us that the 1965 state-sanctioned police murder of 26-year-old Jimmy Lee Jackson in Selma, Ala., was the impetus for the Selma-to-Montgomery marches, \u201cGertrude Perkins\u201d is a name that not many people know.\n\n\u201cGertrude Perkins is not even mentioned in the history books, but she had as much to do with the bus boycott as anyone on earth,\u201d Joe Azbell, former city editor of the Montgomery Advertiser, said during a 1997 NPR interview.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are just two of the names we know and here we are today\u2014still.\n\nSexual misconduct is the second-highest form of police misconduct in the nation after excessive force. \ufeffAccording to a 2007 report prepared for the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, The Nation reports, \u201cRape and sexual abuse by police [in the United States] are primarily reported by women of color.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[B]lack women are routinely killed, raped and beaten by the police,\u201d wrote Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, director of Columbia Law School\u2019s Center for Intersectionality and Social Policy Studies and co-founder of the African American Policy Forum, in the 2015 report \u201c#SayHerName: Resisting Police Brutality Against Black Women.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt the 2018 Golden Globes Awards on Sunday night, Oprah Winfrey brought these women into the room. She stood before Hollywood\u2019s elite crowd and told Recy Taylor\u2019s story. She didn\u2019t just talk about the women who are assaulted on casting couches, but the women who work on farms and in diners and in academia who have all been silenced by too-powerful men.\n\n\n\nAnd while she didn\u2019t mention her own story of being repeatedly molested and of being raped at 9 years old by a family friend, you could see it in her eyes and hear it in her voice as she said, \u201cMe, too.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt the intersection of state and sexual violence, you will find black women who are silenced, ignored and erased. That has been the reality for too long because we live in a country where our blackness and our gender have made assaults against our bodies permissible. As I\u2019ve written previously, systemic oppression has always been mapped on the bodies of black women\u2014whether that oppression manifests through state violence or in our own communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTarana Burke, founder of the #MeToo movement, was in tears Sunday night because this moment is not just shining a much deserved spotlight on her tireless work; it is not just a moment for white women to confront their complicity in violence against women of color; it is not just a moment to disrupt the dominant narrative that rape and sexual assault matter only when the victims are young, rich, able-bodied, straight and white.\n\n\n\nBurke, who began her organizing career in Alabama and has played a key role in organizing events in Selma, has made it clear that this movement is built on the shoulders of our elders.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t do this work without continuously referencing the work of Rosa Parks fighting against the sexual and racial violence that black women were subjected to,\u201d she told The Root.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis means that it is our duty to tell these stories. It is our duty to lift up our elders and ancestors so that no one forgets their names or dilutes their legacies. We are standing in a tradition of black women who fought back against white supremacy and sexual violence over 70 years ago and made it plain that there can be no black liberation if black women are not free.\n\nThis movement is for Recy Taylor.\n\n\n\nThis movement is for Gertrude Perkins.\n\nThis movement is for Claudette Colvin, and for all of the black girls who are shamed into silence because they have been told they aren\u2019t good enough, pretty enough or smart enough for anyone to pay attention.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis movement continues the work of Rosa Parks, who risked her life chasing justice for black women in the Jim Crow South, only to have her legacy be distilled down to not giving up her seat on a bus.\n\nThis movement is for the five women who did not get justice even though, they, too, were raped by Daniel Holtzclaw.\n\nThis movement is for the young Oprah Winfreys\u2014born into poverty in the Deep South, molested, neglected and not expected to survive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis movement is for the black girls who, right now, are being raped and abused in their homes and in their churches and in their schools by people who claim to love them in a nation that claims to care.\n\n\n\nThis movement is ours.\n\nThere is no slowing down.

Bannon was asked specific questions that had been negotiated between the White House and the House\u2019s lead counsel.\n\nBannon had been subpoenaed by the committee on Jan. 16 but managed to postpone the subpoena deadline three times as the White House and House lawyers negotiated which questions he could answer without the White House invoking executive privilege to prevent him from testifying.\n\nDemocrat Rep. Adam Schiff of California, ranking member of the committee, told reporters: \u201cThe only questions he would answer were questions that had been scripted, literally scripted for him by the White House. Whenever we sought to probe anything beyond the four corners of the specific wording of the question, he refused to answer. That\u2019s not how executive privilege works.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, lawmakers said that continued noncooperation on Bannon\u2019s part could result in the committee taking steps to hold him in contempt of Congress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe claims of executive privilege will be looked into by committee member Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), who said that he will work with House Speaker Paul Ryan and House lawyers to determine whether contempt proceedings would be appropriate.\n\nSo the White House was able to script what Bannon told the House Intelligence Committee, but it wasn\u2019t able to do that for Bannon\u2019s meetings with Mueller.\n\nWhich leaves us to wonder what Bannon may have told Mueller. Did he roll over on his former friend and boss? The way he slobbered on the mic for Michael Wolff for the freeski would lead one to believe that under fear of some type of legal recourse against him, he may have done the same with Mueller.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, to be a fly on the wall for that.\n\nI need Mueller to drop the bomb already.

Brown, the man who makes men cry, won for best actor in a TV drama for This Is Us, but his melanated peers came up short.\n\nThis year, the awards show chose to shine a light on sexual harassment and misconduct. And you know, besides having amazing activists like Tarana Burke on the set, this year\u2019s show seemed like a night for white women in Hollywood to mete out some public comeuppance. And they got in some zingers, too.\n\nBut otherwise, it was black goose eggs.\n\nEven Black-ish lost. So did Issa Rae, Mary J. Blige, Octavia Spencer, Anthony Anderson and Daniel Kaluuya.

She received the Cecil B. DeMille Award for her outsize contribution to entertainment, putting her in the company of Hollywood legends like Steven Spielberg, Robin Williams, Barbra Streisand and Sidney Poitier (Oprah began her speech by referencing Poitier).\n\nShe called the name of Rosa Parks.

It would clear up speculation that the Knavses used their son-in-law\u2019s executive privilege to usurp the system, as he\u2019s been known to do. Not only would clarification as to their status be helpful, but it would also seem like the right thing to do given that this administration drew a hard line in the sand over immigration and then built a wall around the line and didn\u2019t get Mexico to pay for it.\n\nAccording to the New York Daily News, while speculation surrounds the president\u2019s in-laws, he continues to ramp up his war on immigrants:\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement announced just this week that they made 40% more arrests in general within President Trump\u2019s first year compared to 2016. ICE claims to have taken 37,734 \u201cnon-criminal\u201d immigrants \u2014 people who don\u2019t have criminal records or those who might face charges \u2014 into custody. That number is more than double the amount of non-criminal arrests made in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this is Donald Trump we\u2019re talking about, so would it surprise any of us if we were to find out one day that Trump sent a Russian spy jet to pick up his in-laws and bring them to the United States?

It\u2019s a quality that\u2019s immediately calming to the listener and connects you with her.\n\nThe Glow Up had the pleasure of catching up with Dandridge during her current run on Broadway as Papa Ge\u2014a riff on the Haitian Creole god Gu\u00e9d\u00e9\u2014in the revival of the Caribbean-inspired Broadway musical Once on This Island at New York City\u2019s famed Circle in the Square Theatre.\n\nPapa Ge is a major departure from Grace Greenleaf, the role bringing Dandridge national recognition as the star of Greenleaf, on the OWN Network. Aside from the gender-bending roles of this production, which also stars Glee favorite Alex Newell as goddess Asaka, singing the house down, Dandridge\u2019s embodiment of Papa Ge is raw, sinewy and very dark. Fitting, for the god of death. As she tells The Glow Up:\n\nPeople who know the show have real opinions and feelings about how it should be done, and it\u2019s been really exciting to see those people\u2014myself included\u2014come in with a fresh perspective. ... If you change the gender, you release it from so many parameters, when you\u2019re doing a revival. And all of a sudden, the role became fresh and new, and I just couldn\u2019t wait to dig into it and find out who this person was. So that was a no-brainer for me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis production, poignantly set on a hurricane-ravaged tropical island, is strewn with remnants of a life once lived. The ensemble cast, which includes a child and a goat\u2014yes, a goat\u2014is living and loving amid the rubble, a stark reminder of our brothers and sisters in devastated parts of the Caribbean this holiday season. As Dandridge notes:\n\nThe audience walks into this place post-hurricane. Garbage is everywhere, and the remnants of disaster-relief care packages that might not be so helpful. ... But then we turn these bits of garbage into things that are helpful and beautiful, to uplift the spirit. So even subliminally, I feel like there\u2019s a sense that even out of the rubble, the human spirit and everything that goes along with it triumphing are going to be elucidated and elevated while we do this\u2014while we pick up the rubble. And it sends a message that we are not we are not stuck in our despair. We can rise, and we can do it by helping each other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDandridge\u2019s own transformation during the show is transfixing and sinister, as her onstage scavenger hunt grows into a costume literally made of metal, hair, skin and bones. She tells The Glow Up that the transformation is as much emotional as physical:\n\nIn my building of this character, it\u2019s very much a broken woman who is so hurt and has been so devastated that she\u2019s shed everything and let go of her femininity; lets go of anything worldly and just lives in the earth and in the spirit realm in the conjuring ... you just see this sinewy, very from-the-gut primal character that is devoid of all that stuff. So I hope that in the building of a character and the audience going on the journey with us that they are not distracted by the costume, but led on the emotional journey of Papa Ge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those of us who are fans of OWN\u2019s Greenleaf, we\u2019ve also watched the emotional journey of Grace Greenleaf, a role Dandridge has brought to the screen with the same grounded grace (yes, pun intended) with which she seems to approach her life. She says:\n\nThere was a real sense of knowing and peace when this particular script came across my desk. When I read it, it just seemed so familiar, and just easy in my spirit. Sometimes, it takes a little bit of creativity and work to squeeze yourself into a character and really build that, so that you understand something that\u2019s foreign to you. I had an innate understanding of Grace Greenleaf as soon as I read her. ... She\u2019s very complicated, and very flawed. And I love that about her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe feeling was apparently mutual, as Oprah claims to have known that Dandridge was \u201cthe one\u201d as soon as she saw her audition tape. She immediately asked the actress for a meeting, which Dandridge says \u201cwas the genesis of a continuing conversation.\u201d\n\nThe experience of shooting Greenleaf has also been a very personal one for Dandridge. She\u2019s working with some incredible on-set teachers in the cast\u2014like fellow stage-and-screen actor Keith David, who plays Grace\u2019s father, Bishop James Greenleaf\u2014but Greenleaf\u2019s plot resonates with Dandridge\u2019s own family, too:\n\nGrowing up, I was always in church every Sunday morning, and my summers were spent in Memphis[, Tenn.,] with my dad\u2019s family all day at our church, so my family is my barometer. And if it\u2019s hitting with them, I think we\u2019re hitting the mark\u2014and we always are. ... And then, on the flip side of that, to have those waves of understanding and resonance come back at me from the audience, to know that we\u2019re hitting the heartbeat of what we\u2019re trying to say\u2014it\u2019s deeply gratifying. So it\u2019s a win-win, and I\u2019m thrilled all the way around.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up gift tip: If you\u2019re in the New York City area this holiday season, try to catch Merle Dandridge and the spectacular cast of Once on This Island at Circle in the Square.

It was a warm, caring and very emotional speech that we know wasn\u2019t heartfelt because he expressed his true feelings on Twitter around 4 this morning:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTranslation: It\u2019s the students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 fault that the shooting occurred, and they should have screamed about this dangerous kid more. But the fact is, the FBI was warned last year about how Nikolas Cruz posted that he wanted to be a professional school shooter!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the president spoke Thursday around 11:30 a.m. EST, he took all of six-and-a-half-minutes to address the tragedy. That\u2019s less time than he took to rant about NFL players kneeling; that\u2019s less time than he took to praise alleged wife beater and former White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter; that\u2019s barely more time than it takes for Doug E. Fresh to go on.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t name any of the victims; nor did he praise the brave students or teachers. He spent most of his limited time giving an \u201cafter-school special\u201d lecture about how you never need to be alone in high school\u2014and if you\u2019re sad, there is someone you should reach out to. It was a speech seemingly intended to touch the heart of the next shooter out there who apparently just needs a hug in order to not murder his classmates.\n\nMind you, if this wasn\u2019t the most divisive president in the history of presidents, then maybe his entreaties for peace and love would make a difference, but he is who he is, so his pleas don\u2019t hold weight and they won\u2019t change anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most glaring part of the speech came at the end, when the president pledged that America must \u201ctackle the difficult issue of mental health.\u201d He didn\u2019t say \u201cguns\u201d once in his speech. Trump took pains to make no mention of guns. If Tim Gunn had jumped in front of him, ripped off his well-tailored sleeves, flexed and screamed, \u201cWhat do you think of these??\u201d Trump would still have found a way to say, \u201cHow\u2019s that mental health going?\u201d\n\nMental health has become the ultimate red herrng for Republicans who don\u2019t want to talk about guns no matter who gets shot, or how bloody or egregious and avoidable the crime may have been. The country is full of people with \u201cmental health problems,\u201d and they aren\u2019t shooting up schools every week. You know who is shooting up schools and nightclubs and office buildings every week? People who are legally allowed to buy AR-15s. Fix that problem and maybe we can stop with the disingenuous chorus of tweets citing \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d every 60 hours.\n\nAlas, we know that Trump won\u2019t do anything; nor will Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell or House Speaker Paul Ryan. When Republicans can get shot up at their own baseball game and still refuse to pass meaningful gun legislation, there\u2019s no reason to think that another shooting of innocent kids will spur them to action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as student survivor David Hogg just told CNN, somebody has to act like adults.\n\nSince Trump isn\u2019t an adult, and neither are the Republicans in Congress, it\u2019s time for the public to act like adults and vote these gun-fetishizing incompetents out of office this fall\u2014and then demand some real change.", "keywords": ["thats", "mental", "trump", "shootings", "dont", "school", "shooting", "health", "republicans", "speech", "pretend", "cares", "listened", "took", "president"], "polarity": 0.08694761904761902, "subjectivity": 0.45011904761904753},

Riley was right there.\n\n\n\nOf course, Barack was looking at wife Michelle, the woman he loves. Meanwhile, Riley was gazing out at a room full of women he loves, including longtime former boss Oprah Winfrey. The year was 2005, and Riley was producing the Legends Ball at Oprah\u2019s custom-built private Santa Barbara, Calif., estate, appropriately named \u201cthe Promised Land.\u201d\n\nThis, and many equally fabulous and intimate moments like it, reflect the impact of women\u2014especially black women\u2014on Riley\u2019s life. After 30 years in television, as a producer for both Oprah\u2019s and Wendy Williams\u2019 talk shows, he is now the author of the new book That\u2019s What Friends Are For: On the Women Who Inspire Me. Riley says that our former president\u2019s words echo the feeling he has held for black women since he was \u201cin the womb.\u201d\n\nRiley\u2019s book is a tale of growing up different. His father was in the Air Force, moving his family to far-flung locales like Tokyo before eventually settling in Valdosta, Ga., in the 1970s. Growing up an oft-uprooted military brat and trying to fit in was not easy, especially as a gay child in a place and time that was not so accepting.\n\nThankfully, Riley had a mother who understood how to nourish her son\u2019s soul with outings to the opera and symphony. But while mother and son shared many conversations about culture, \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d was still the unspoken word at home. Instead, Riley found companionship and validation in the songs and stage talents of women he admired. Listening to divas uplifted him and led him to find a path to both himself and the #BlackGirlMagic heaven he dreamed of finding. He would be their angel.\n\nWomen in the arts and entertainment were the muses from my childhood who made me feel better when I was an unsure little boy who didn\u2019t quite know how to live in his truth. These women could tear my heart out with a melody or a soliloquy in a movie, appealing to the outcast I sometimes felt like in my search for acceptance.\n\nThe black gay man\u2019s search for acceptance is a timely conversation, as evidenced by last week\u2019s controversy after Patti LaBelle revealed to Bravo TV\u2019s Andy Cohen that Luther Vandross\u2019 decision to remain closeted all of his life was so as not to disappoint his mother. It\u2019s a subject that touches Riley deeply. Although his own mother understood that her son might be gay, there was a deafening silence on the matter between the two of them. To spare her feelings, Riley chose not to come out until after his mother\u2019s death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening now in this current political climate is a reversal of empathy,\u201d Riley says. It\u2019s the reason that he feels the timing is right for this memoir, despite print being on a sharp decline, with even celebrity-centric books struggling to make it into the hands of readers hungry for content about black life.\n\nDorpie Books, the publisher of That\u2019s What Friends Are For, is a black-owned and -operated imprint and a new model of publishing that puts the power in the hands of the audience, allowing them to crowdfund the projects they want to read. It addresses a dire need for publishers to print and promote books by authors of color\u2014one recently expressed by celebrity and new author Gabrielle Union.\n\nThis coming-of-age story features both jewels of personal wisdom and gems from the entertainment world. Riley\u2019s memories illuminate the kindness and humanity of stars from Lena Horne to Beyonc\u00e9, while bringing to light the questions and struggles of many in the LGBTQ community with tenderness and humor. In this excerpt, Riley recounts:\n\nBy high school, I had the jaded notion that there was a hard road ahead that maybe I couldn\u2019t handle, reconciling my insides to what was going on outside. I wondered if I would ever come out as a gay man. Would I continue to go the course that society wanted me to? Could I marry a woman? These were big questions I had to start asking myself while peers were taking next steps into their intimate relationships.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEventually Riley did fall in love\u2014with the friendship he perceived between Patti Labelle and Dionne Warwick while watching Sisters in the Name of Love, the 1986 AIDS fundraising concert they hosted on HBO with fellow diva Gladys Knight. What he saw between them on-screen became his real-life standard for what friends should be to one another and the good that friendship can bring into the world.\n\nIt was a crush that would become a career. \u201cBefore I knew it, there I was in the TV business, either interviewing my favorite celebrity women or producing their projects,\u201d he says.\n\nThe pages of That\u2019s What Friends Are For read like a producer\u2019s personal diary of Hollywood glitterati, filled with behind-the-scenes photos and very personal anecdotes about the strong women, from activists to athletes, who helped light his journey to both personal and professional success.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRiley\u2019s prose sparkles when he describes the \u201cenergy that comes off of Beyonc\u00e9 or Janet Jackson when I touch their hand to greet them,\u201d and he recounts so many priceless moments, like Queen Bey singing him \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d on a trip to Manila, Philippines; or the interview he landed with the Boss Miss Ross and Motown founder Berry Gordy at the opening night of Broadway\u2019s Motown the Musical. And then there are the poignant ones, like when he shared tears with Warwick over the tragic loss of her little cousin, singer Whitney Houston.\n\nAt the core of That\u2019s What Friends Are For: On the Women Who Inspire Me lies a highly personal mission: \u201cIf just one gay kid can find a spot of inspiration in this text, along with others who can give support to the LGBTQ community, my efforts will have been worth it.\u201d Because after all, that\u2019s what friends are for.\n\nThe Glow Up gift tip: Preorders of That\u2019s What Friends Are For: On the Women Who Inspire Me are available now through Dec. 22 at Dorpie Books ($35):\n\nAdvertisement", "keywords": ["mother", "meet", "thats", "riley", "personal", "black", "books", "gay", "legendary", "bffs", "patrick", "inspire", "women", "friends"], "polarity": 0.17496914121914128, "subjectivity": 0.4576360126360127},

Among the findings: Nine of the 10 states with the biggest gaps were found in the South.\n\n\n\nThe Hechinger Report released an interactive look Monday at how many black and Latinx high school graduates make it to their state\u2019s main college or university. Why focus on the state\u2019s flagship public institution as opposed to, say, a better-known or more competitive private school? As the Baltimore Sun points out, schools like the University of Maryland, College Park, and the University of Mississippi, because they\u2019re taxpayer-funded, typically emphasize service to in-state students. They\u2019re considered \u201cbeacons of attainable, affordable education,\u201d the Sun writes, but on top of that, students who graduate from flagship universities tend to make more than their peers who went to other state-funded schools.\n\nA large gap between the percentage of black high school grads a state produces and the percentage enrolled at a flagship campus, then, can point to a troubling gap in who a state\u2019s high school graduates are, and who gets the best educational opportunities from college onward.\n\nThe University of Mississippi, the University of South Carolina, the University of Georgia, Louisiana State University and the University of Delaware have the worst gaps in the country, with Ole Miss leading the way. In 2015, half of Mississippi\u2019s graduates were black, yet Ole Miss\u2019 total black student enrollment that year was just 10 percent.\n\nThe study also looked at Latinx students. A regional pattern emerged in these findings, too\u2014though not as stark as the corresponding study covering black students. States in the Southwest and West made up a majority of the top 10, with California, Texas, Nevada, Colorado and Arizona having the largest gaps. In California, Latinx students received more than half of all high school diplomas in 2015, but Latinx students made up less than 15 percent of the student body at the state\u2019s flagship campus, the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Baltimore Sun, writing about the University of Maryland, which had the sixth-worst gap for black students, covers a few reasons why the lag exists there.\n\nThe article notes that UMD College Park is surrounded by HBCUs, including Howard University in Washington, D.C., which offer strong competition in recruiting black students. Racist incidents on the College Park campus may have also deterred black students looking for a more welcoming, inclusive and safe environment. Just last year, a black Bowie State University student was killed, allegedly by a white Maryland student in a crime prosecutors say was race-motivated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoing to a school where 10 percent or less of the student body looks like you can be an isolating experience. The recent uptick in hate incidents on majority-white college campuses means that isolation can also be dangerous.\n\nDisparities in the quality of high schools that serve majority-black communities were also pointed out as a possible contributing factor. One current Maryland sophomore, Amari Harris, told the paper that it was hard to compete with schools that offered more resources and extracurriculars, like robotics clubs or debate teams.", "keywords": ["student", "souths", "premier", "black", "university", "school", "flagship", "enrollment", "students", "high", "state", "campuses", "lagging", "report", "college", "states"], "polarity": 0.030366963283629964, "subjectivity": 0.44070586820586805},

Originally based on supermodels Naomi Campbell and Tyra Banks, the Dora were initially conceived not only as female warriors but also as potential wives for the king, whom they\u2019ve pledged to protect, along with the royal family. They were the best and strongest women from the 18 villages within Wakanda and trained at the royal palace.\n\nBut while Priest may in part cite supermodels as his inspiration, there is a historical prototype for the Dora Milaje in the Dahomey \u201cAmazons\u201d\u2014so nicknamed by European colonizers and now known by the French-speaking Beninese as the \u201cN\u2019Nonmiton\u201d (which translates to \u201cour mothers\u201d in Fon).\n\nCreated by King Agaja of the West African nation of Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) in the 18th century, the N\u2019Nonmiton were an all-female guard and fighting force, likely inspired by the female hunters known as gbeto. Like the Dora Milaje, the N\u2019Nonmiton were also considered wives of the king, pledging celibacy as well as loyalty and protection to him. And they existed in this role until the colonization of Dahomey in the late 19th century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can learn all about the incredible female warriors of Dahomey in a 2015 episode of the podcast Stuff You Missed in History Class, and in a very comprehensive comic on their history created by UNESCO for its Series on Women in African History (pdf).

We all know it\u2019s been hard to get over Barack: He took America to meet his family in Kenya, brought some flowers for the National Portrait Gallery; we all know he was a good guy and America misses him.\n\nSeriously, though, what nation in its right mind would want to stay with a leader who is constantly threatening the press, is mired in corruption and built his career on racism, and who was not only accused of rape but also led chants of \u201cBurn the bitch\u201d against his political opponent? All of this sounds a lot like Trump, and you\u2019d think America would say \u201cBoy, bye\u201d to that kind of leader\u2014but we\u2019re still playing \u201che picked me for less than the popular vote\u201d with President Crotch Grabber.\n\nBelieve it or not, the aforementioned actions are by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and/or South African President Jacob Zuma. But unlike the United States, those two nations have had enough and told their leaders that they\u2019ll be sleeping on the couch until the divorce is final. Who knew it would take two second world nations with a bit of backbone to remind America of how dating while democratic is supposed to get done?\n\nOn Tuesday, South Africa\u2019s ruling national party, the African National Congress, called for President Jacob Zuma to step down by Valentine\u2019s Day or face a no-confidence vote. And you know what? He did it. You know that old anthem \u201cWhen a Nation\u2019s Fed Up\u201d? Well, Zuma had this coming to him.\n\nFrom 2005 to the present day, Jacob Zuma has been on one. He\u2019s spent the last decade fighting off 783 counts of bribery and racketeering from an illegal arms deal. He was charged with raping an HIV-positive daughter of a political ally, then claimed that he \u201ctook a shower\u201d after sex to make sure he didn\u2019t have HIV. Then he went outside the courtroom and led chants of \u201cBurn the bitch.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen he \u201cconsensually\u201d knocked up another friend\u2019s daughter. A friend who happened to be chairman of the South African World Cup committee and owner of the popular Orlando Pirates soccer team. That would be like Trump knocking up Patriots owner Robert Kraft\u2019s daughter, then turning around and asking him to promote Boston as the next Summer Olympics site. Zuma did most of this after he was elected to office in 2009. Yes, South Africa was ready to swipe left.\n\nSince Valentine\u2019s Day seems to be the perfect opportunity to cut out of a bad relationship while you still can, the Israeli government has followed the South African example.\n\nOn Tuesday, Israeli police announced that they had \u201csufficient evidence\u201d to charge Prime Minister Benjamin \u201cBibi\u201d Netanyahu with bribery, fraud and \u201cbreach of trust.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNetanyahu, who has been in office since \u201909, tried to buy off a newspaper that was critical of him, authorities charge. Then, in exchange for expensive gifts and favors, he arranged for visas and tried to push through a massive tax cut for Arnon Milchan, a big-time Hollywood producer ( movies like Pretty Woman, JFK and 12 Years a Slave) who wanted to move to Israel, officials say.\n\nHow did Bibi get caught and who ratted him out? Yair Lapid, leader of the Yesh Atid party that is part of Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition, dropped a dime on the prime minister and has publicly asked him to step down from power. When asked by the press why he stood up to Netanyahu\u2019s pressure, he said:\n\nIn this instance as in other instances, Yesh Atid was the last barrier against government corruption, in the face of politicians occupied solely with themselves and their own well-being.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBang, bang! Shots fired!\n\nCan you imagine House Speaker Paul Ryan or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ever flipping for special counsel Robert Mueller because the Republican Party was the last barrier against corruption? Can you imagine the Republican Party standing up to Trump\u2019s various wife-beating, sexually assaulting cronies and calling for their removal? Of course not. These guys think #MeToo is a call-and-response for who gets to kiss Trump\u2019s butt at the next staff meeting.\n\nIn high school, we\u2019re taught that American presidents are kept in check by more checks and balances than a block of Wells Fargos, but nobody is doing anything in America about Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet, less democratic states like South Africa have managed to remove a corrupt leader, and in Israel, even if Netanyahu puts up a fight, it\u2019s clear that members of his own coalition are willing to hold him accountable if he strays too far.\n\nAmerica used to be savage like that. The Senate voted on Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment right before Valentine\u2019s Day, over a blow job. Yet somehow, the nation has lost its way with the current trash president, while others act like the nation we used to be.\n\nOn Wednesday, the ANC bought Zuma a nice Nando\u2019s gift certificate and a one-way ticket to GTFOH-istan. In Israel, if Netanyahu somehow survives the charges against him, there\u2019s no chance he\u2019ll be his party\u2019s leader by the 2019 elections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerica should totally join the Break Up With Your Terrible Leader Club today.

But I came to learn that this was no accident; I wasn\u2019t meant to be there. I applied to Bowie State University with just a couple of weeks remaining before the beginning of the fall semester of 1997, and they offered me a full scholarship as well.\n\nThe size and culture of BSU were a perfect fit for someone who had attended a small boarding school in the predominantly white town of Hershey, Pa. There was no housing left in the freshman dorms, so they put me in an upperclassman dorm called Tubman. They made a way for me. The small class sizes made it easy to develop relationships with professors and for them to truly get to know our abilities. After a week in my freshman English class, I was moved into the honors program. I was grateful.\n\nSocially, acclimating to life farther south was a bit of a culture shock, since I hailed from New York City. There was a different style of dress and accents.

It was Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Cortes said. \u201cDo you want us to bring him to you?\u201d the officer asked, Rodriguez later recalled. \u201cThat would be great,\u201d the voice responded. Minutes later, the officers left Rodriguez at a nearby ICE field office. Rodriguez was shackled and later taken to the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, one of the largest detention facilities in the nation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it turns out, the warrant wasn\u2019t criminal at all. According to the Tukwila Police Department\u2019s own admissions, it misinterpreted the nature of the warrant against Rodriguez. It was actually an administrative warrant, related to a missed court hearing from 2004, when authorities in Texas discovered that he had entered the country illegally.\n\nRodriguez\u2019s lawyer, Luis Cortes Romero, told the Post that his client never received the notice to attend the mandatory court meeting, but missing it triggered a removal order.\n\nThis makes Rodriguez\u2019s arrest, essentially, a mistake. The Tukwila PD confirmed that it \u201cdoes not respond to U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement requests to detain individuals on their behalf.\u201d The only reason Rodriguez was arrested was that his administrative warrant appeared like a criminal one in the National Criminal Information Center database.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite this, Immigration and Customs Enforcement now refuses to release Rodriguez, according to his lawyer. He maintains that his client has no criminal record. Rodriguez could be deported within a matter of days, leaving his young children without a father.\n\n\n\nThe arrest falls in line with one of the more troubling trends of the Donald Trump administration. Arrests of noncriminal undocumented immigrants have skyrocketed in the last year. The Washington Post found that ICE had detained 37,734 undocumented \u201cnoncriminal\u201d immigrants in 2017. This was twice the number arrested in Barack Obama\u2019s final year as president.\n\n\n\nAside from the obvious concerns, of upending the lives of thousands of people and disrupting families and communities, the immigrant crackdown has also triggered a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on crime reporting across the country. Undocumented immigrants who are the victims of crimes like robbery and sexual assault have refused to report them for fear of being handed over to ICE, according to police and immigration advocates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Police Department, which says it has \u201cworked tirelessly\u201d to develop and maintain relations with its large immigrant and refugee population, says that it will not be responding to administrative warrants from ICE going forward.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Rodriguez\u2019s lawyer has requested a stay of removal for the carpenter on humanitarian grounds, the Post reports. He\u2019s the sole provider for his partner and their three children.", "keywords": ["help", "rodriguez", "immigrant", "post", "ice", "criminal", "warrant", "faces", "according", "tukwila", "reports", "calling", "undocumented", "deportation"], "polarity": 0.0340531561461794, "subjectivity": 0.40299003322259136},

I do not know when you dropped this list. Real talk, it doesn\u2019t matter, but I have some very real questions about your rankings. Basically, how in the holy hell did you come up with them?\n\nWhy do I ask? I\u2019m glad you asked.\n\nLet\u2019s just start with the lead here: I went to Morehouse College in Atlanta. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of it. You did do an HBCU ranking, after all. Well, in recent years, Morehouse has gone through many different phases, from being in a low to heading back toward the highs that defined her halcyon years and living up to the vision of Benjamin Elijah Mays. While I was in college, these rankings came out each year, and a constant fun, cross-the-street battle between Morehouse and Spelman College always ensued.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest: My opinion of Spelman is so high that I don\u2019t care if we never, ever beat them in a ranking. As far as I\u2019m concerned, Spelman is now and will always be No. 1. But when doing rankings, various magazines and entities see things differently. Your particular ranking\u2014well, you had Howard University at No. 1. Cool. I have no beef with this. Spelman College was ranked at No. 2. OK. I guess that means Morehouse will be coming in at No. 3, a fine ranking and wha\u2014wait, Hampton is No. 3. Hmm ... OK. Again, we had been having some issues. Enrollment. Graduation rates. OK. I see you, College Choice\u2014you being stingy. But aight. Surely we\u2019re at 4.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo. Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, is at No. 4. Hmmm. Shit just got real. Is Morehouse at No. 5? No. That would be Xavier University of Louisiana.\n\nHmm. OK, let\u2019s cut to the chase. Morehouse is ranked at No. 23 on this list. Behind the aforementioned schools and the following, in order by ranking, starting at No. 6: Bowie State University, Lincoln University of Pennsylvania, Florida A&M University, Edward Waters College, Southern University at New Orleans, Prairie View A&M University, North Carolina A&T State University, North Carolina Central University, West Virginia State University, Fayetteville State University, Tougaloo College, Le Moyne-Owen College, Dillard University, Concordia College Alabama, Johnson C. Smith University, Claflin University and Delaware State University.\n\nAll of those schools are ranked higher than Morehouse. Do you know who is conspicuously rated near the bottom of your list? None other than Tuskegee University, which is ranked at a hefty No. 49 out of the 50 listed. Fisk and Morgan State also made it into the latter half of the listed schools at No. 26 and No. 32 respectively. How, Sway? Seriously, how?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow compare that to the U.S. News and World Reports HBCU rankings for 2018. Here is THEIR top 10: Spelman, Howard, Hampton, Morehouse, Xavier, FAMU, Tuskeegee, A&T, Claflin and Fisk.\n\nSo you all agree on the first three schools, though in a slightly different order, but then everything else takes a left turn. Hmm. U.S. News rankings tend to be a go-to even if they are also imperfect. I guess I should read YOUR description (below) associated with Morehouse to better understand why we made it all the way down to No. 23. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a perfectly reasonable and justifiable\u2014and, hell, maybe even accurate\u2014reason. Ahem. Emphasis mine:\n\nHoward Thurman, Benjamin Mays, Martin Luther King, Jr., David Satcher, Maynard Jackson, Donn Clendenon, Spike Lee, are a few \u201cMorehouse Men\u201d who have helped change the world. Established in 1867, Morehouse College is one of the best colleges in the nation, top HBCU, and one of the best schools for black men. The school\u2019s mission is \u201cto produce academically superior, morally conscious leaders for the conditions and issues of today.\u201d Morehouse is top men\u2019s college for producing Rhodes Scholars, and one of the top HBCUs to produce Rhodes Scholars. Forbes, U.S. News and World Report, Newsweek, and others rank the school as a distinguished institution of higher learning. Along with is rich history and academic rigor, Morehouse has international recognition for its Glee Club, Debate Team and Marching Band. Furthermore, the school houses the King Collection which holds thousands of written documents by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo let me get this right, College Choice: According to the very shit you printed, Morehouse College is a top HBCU and one of the best colleges in the nation. ACCORDING to what you provided IN YOUR WRITE-UP. And yet, on the tier list for HBCUs, of which you stated there are 105 (though you only ranked 50), Morehouse would show up in the third tier?\n\nI\u2019m not saying that Morehouse is Harvard, though we do have fun T-shirts that say \u201cHarvard: The Morehouse of the North\u201d on them. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the best HBCU, either. That is easily debatable, and to be real, Howard does things and has bandwidth Morehouse couldn\u2019t dream of reaching. We\u2019re great at different things, and a lot of it is comparing apples to oranges. But comparisons get made. Morehouse attracts lots of great talent, as evidenced by your own note about producing Rhodes scholars. Do we have to be No. 1? No. But how are we No. 23 behind schools\u2014and this is no disrespect\u2014like Concordia College Alabama, which I didn\u2019t even know existed until I saw your list?\n\nSome of the HBCUs ranked higher are fine institutions, with some being finer than others, but what are you even using to come up with your College Choice Score? And how does Howard rank 100 percent? Is that 100 percent among HBCUs or 100 percent among all schools? I mean, Harvard (rated the No. 1 college or university overall) scored 100 percent. But Princeton, No. 2, only scored a 97 percent. So how did that work?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, Howard University doesn\u2019t show up at all on your list of the 100 best colleges and universities despite that 100 percent score\u2014I guess it only ranks that way against HBCUs. The 100th-best university, according to you niggas, is Pitzer College in Claremont, Calif., part of the Claremont schools, and it\u2019s scored at 65 percent against the rest. Of what? Fuck if I know. Even THOSE rankings make no sense. The University of Michigan, ranked No. 51 on your shit, is No. 28 at U.S. News.\n\nWhat is y\u2019all doin\u2019?\n\nHow the hell are you all assessing schools and what the hell? I\u2019d like some answers. While I\u2019ve never heard of you until today, I\u2019d like you to explain a bit. Either that or until you do right by me, everything you even think about gon\u2019 fail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUm ... K. Thanks.

The Trump administration temporarily expanded this guest-worker program in 2017 while restricting other avenues of legal immigration, including the H-1B program for high-skilled workers. The Trump Organization is exactly the kind of company that relies on the H-2B visa program for low-skilled workers. Vox reviewed recruiting files submitted to the US Department of Labor for two Trump properties in Florida (including Mar-a-Lago) and one in New York from the start of 2016 through the end of 2017.

Burgone was also a classmate of Sean Christopher Urbanski, the savagely violent 22-year-old charged with plunging a knife into the chest of Richard Collins III days before Collins was scheduled to graduate from Bowie State University. Collins had also recently been commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApparently, Burgone hung out with a group of no-good gangsters who preyed on innocent people, and when one of them went on Facebook to praise the homicidal act, Burgone couldn\u2019t help chiming in because, you know, \u201cthose people\u201d have no self-control.\n\nIf you think referring to these thugs as \u201cgangsters\u201d is pejorative, you should know that these men consider themselves \u201coriginal gangsters,\u201d a term used almost exclusively by young Caucasian males who saw Boyz n the Hood late one night on HBO while making crystal meth in the bathtub or caught Menace to Society on Hulu. When news of the crime spread on white Twitter, Matt Worth, one of Urbanski and Burgone\u2019s homeboys, updated his status with:\n\nFuck Yeah Sean!!!! That\u2019s what happens when niggas try and get frosty with an OG. Talk shit, stabbed, lol\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBurgone\u2014again, who had been recruited to be a police officer\u2014liked the post so much, he didn\u2019t just simply give it the obligatory thumbs-up; he thought it more prudent to join in. He posted a meme with ...\n\nYou know what? I wouldn\u2019t want to do Burgone\u2019s reply an injustice by simply describing it. We all know that wypipo are genetically inferior when it comes to memes, so here it is:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo its credit, when the Anne Arundel Police Department heard about the racist posts, it immediately suspended Burgone and issued a statement:\n\nThe actions of this employee are a betrayal of the values of the Anne Arundel County Police Department. Any employee who espouses or supports hateful or racist ideology will be held accountable and we will not allow the public\u2019s trust in their police department to be eroded.\n\nThe statement made no mention of one incontrovertible fact that bears repeating once more: A police department thought this guy would make an excellent law-enforcement officer because obviously, his decision-making skills demonstrate that he would have no problem assessing situations with a gun in his hand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, we must acknowledge that young Caucasian males grow up accustomed to gun violence that manifests itself as school shootings, white supremacy or stabbing soldiers in the chest at bus stops, so we shouldn\u2019t blame them for espousing hate on the internet.

When it was revealed that both the FBI and White House officials knew about the allegations against both men, it raised questions as to why they were allowed to keep their jobs and whether or not this administration enables abusers.\n\nIn a White House press briefing Monday afternoon, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders asserted that the White House takes the allegations \u201cvery seriously\u201d and believes that they should be \u201cinvestigated thoroughly.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe president and the entire administration take domestic violence very seriously and believe all allegations need to be investigated thoroughly. Above all, the president supports victims of domestic violence and believes everyone should be treated fairly and with due process. We\u2019ve addressed this situation extensively, and we have nothing more to add at this time on that topic,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nWhen asked why we haven\u2019t heard the president himself say that he supports victims, Sanders said, \u201cI spoke with the president. Those are actually directly his words that he gave me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen pressed on the issue as to why Donald Trump hasn\u2019t said that when he\u2019s had the opportunity to do so, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s my job to speak on behalf of the president. I spoke to him, and he relayed that message directly to me, and I\u2019m relaying it directly to you.\u201d\n\nOh, really?\n\nI seem to recall last summer, when asked why the president was allowed to tweet things about special counsel Robert Mueller, Sanders specifically said that it was not her job to speak for the president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, is it \u201cOochie Wally\u201d or is it \u201cOne Mic,\u201d Suckabee?\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s interesting that this is the spin we are being given considering that the president has tweeted on his own about the situation, and what he said is the complete antithesis of what Sanders is saying to the American people now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Saturday, the president wrote on Twitter: \u201cPeoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused\u2014life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound like a man who supports victims of domestic violence. That sounds like a man who wants to gaslight victims in favor of the men accused.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked about the Rob Porter situation Friday, Trump defended Porter publicly and said, \u201cHe says he innocent, and I think you have to remember that.\u201d\n\nThat is the same defense he lobbed for then-Senate candidate Roy Moore back in December when allegations of inappropriate sexual contact with minors emerged about Moore.\n\nAt the time, Trump said, \u201cWell, he denies it. He says it didn\u2019t happen. And you have to listen to him also.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, the president himself has been accused 19 times of sexual harassment and sexual abuse\u2014claims that he and the White House have labeled \u201cfake news.\u201d His administration\u2019s policies do not show any amount of care for women who are victims, either. In fact, before he even took office, his team proposed eliminating the Justice Department\u2019s violence-against-women grant programs that allocate funds to organizations that deal with sexual assault and domestic abuse.\n\nAs a woman, I\u2019m not sure how Suckabee reconciles her staunch defense of the president and his bullshit in the wake of the #MeToo movement. That she could stand at that podium and give that bullshit-ass statement is sickening. She knows what her boss has said publicly (more than once!) when it comes to accused abusers, and she continues to defend him anyway. It\u2019s gross.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s obvious the president doesn\u2019t care about victims of domestic violence. He\u2019s made that clear.\n\nThe somewhat shocking reveal here is that maybe Suckabee doesn\u2019t care, either.\n\nAnd that\u2019s sad.", "keywords": ["supports", "victims", "huckabee", "trump", "statements", "sarah", "sanders", "tweets", "white", "house", "violence", "domestic", "say", "president", "allegations", "sexual"], "polarity": 0.035624403844742844, "subjectivity": 0.4193398879839558},

Trump obstructed justice to suppress the tape of him splish-splashing naked in a puddle of post-orgy Soviet urine like an albino walrus wallowing in a pool of off-brand apple juice. Authorities will reveal how he rigged the election, stuffed his pocket full of rubles and manipulated the Justice Department to cover it up.\n\n\n\nEven worse ... none of it will matter.\n\nWhen dissecting the authoritarian-esque rise of the lace-front-wearing chief executive, pundits strain to explain why Trump is bulletproof. They point to partisanship, conservatism and the recently discovered phenomenon of working-class white oppression as the reason that 83 percent of white Republicans and 47 percent of all white people still approve of the job he is doing as president.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s legislative failures, unrepentant racism, and unfortunate allergy to facts and truth, The Donald\u2019s devotees will not admit that he has committed a single misstep. He has convinced congressional Republicans, Fox News watchers and people who consider Nick Cannon \u201ctoo urban\u201d that verifiable evidence means nothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor them, thousands of media outlets have formed a secret cabal to perpetuate fake news. The FBI, CIA, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and the mythical \u201cdeep state\u201d have all manufactured his decadeslong connection with Russia. Random women have all made up similar lies about his sexual misdeeds. Even science and math have joined the party to misstate his popular vote totals, his poll numbers and how many people showed up to his inauguration. There is only one way to explain why logic and reason no longer apply to the president:\n\nDonald Trump is a God.\n\nTrumpism has evolved from a political ideology into a religion with an unerring tyrannical messiah at the center of it all. He is no longer a politician, he is a religious figure, and admitting it is the first step to understanding the cultlike devotion to Donald Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Gospel According to Trump\n\nI do not make this claim without acknowledging the fact that I, too, have made a god out of a mere mortal. Even before I knew or understood what religion or a Bible was, my mother was my first deity, and her words might as well have been written in red in a religious text.\n\nLike Trump\u2019s acolytes toward him, when it came to my mother, I believed that whatever came out of her mouth was the unadulterated truth. In the rare instances that I questioned her, she responded to my queries with the same reasoning offered by the president or a Baptist preacher forced to answer a biblical inconsistency:\n\nBecause she said so.\n\nWhen someone points out that immigrants are less likely to commit a crime, that white men commit more acts of terrorism or that the economy is a product of Obama\u2019s policies, Trump bypasses reason and doubles down on rhetoric. Even though net immigration has been negative for more than 10 years, Trump\u2019s followers believe that kicking out Mexicans and Muslims will magically transform America into a utopian paradise in the same way that some Christians show up on Sundays to pay 10 percent of their income to an already wealthy pastor to buy a seat in the VIP section of the afterlife.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s fans dismiss anyone who questions as an unholy blasphemer using their carnal mind. Nothing has to make sense. He said it. That\u2019s enough.\n\nThus sayeth Trump.\n\nTrump Is Great and Worthy of Praise\n\nWhen talking about Trump\u2019s disciples, we often imagine poor whites in the South and Appalachia who haven\u2019t had anyone so blond and worthy of reverence since Rick Flair hung up his unitard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even learned men have converted to the cult of Trump, as his Cabinet meetings have become eerily similar to the last supper or the final Kool-Aid brunch in Jonestown, Guyana, replete with seemingly intelligent people showering him with praise. He even opens every meeting with praise and worship devotional service:\n\nHe is no longer campaigning, but like other religious figures, Trump travels around the country holding tent revivals and rallies whipping crowds into Holy Ghost-like frenzies when he preaches.

The Navy SEAL who killed Osama bin Laden criticized the plans for a formally attired military display as \u201cThird World bullshit,\u201d but those of us who have attended a black church know that the choir always marches in on the pastor\u2019s anniversary.\n\nTrump Is a Miracle-Maker\n\n\u201cHe performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.\u201d \u2014Job 5:9\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyone examining the cult of Trump cannot ignore his incredible record of accomplishments:\n\n\n\nThere might be some people who fact-check these claims and discover that none of them are true, but those people aren\u2019t true believers. When members of his congregation casually dismiss truth as \u201cfake news,\u201d they are essentially accusing the press of being false prophets trying to smear their savior. Anyone who besmirches his sanctity is a heathen, a liar or\u2014even worse\u2014a Democrat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey will tell you that he kept America safe from terrorism because they don\u2019t count the Las Vegas killing, the Texas church massacre, the Unite the Right killing, or any of the long list of mass shootings and hate crimes as \u201cterrorist events,\u201d in the same way that God answers prayers when anything good happens, but it\u2019s Satan\u2019s fault when anything bad occurs.\n\nThat\u2019s how the cult of Trump works. It also explains why trying to apply reason to the presidency of Donald Trump is an exercise in futility. Facts are irrelevant. Logic is meaningless.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis followers will never believe he\u2019s racist. Republican voters will continue to reject the claims of the 18 women who have accused him of sexual misconduct. Fox News won\u2019t even cover any scandal that doesn\u2019t have to do with Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama. Trump is Teflon. He will never be impeached out of office, even if the FBI investigation turns up concrete evidence that shows he colluded with Russia or obstructed justice.\n\nThe fact that he has been deified by white America is not likely to change.

He was accused of driving 85 mph in a 65 mph zone. When police pulled Francis over, authorities said that he smelled of alcohol. Officials said that he refused a field sobriety test and was arrested and charged. That isn't so bad, given NBA standards.\n\nBut according to TMZ Sports, police in Florida want Francis extradited because there's a warrant out for his arrest after he allegedly ransacked a BMW and stole several items from inside the car worth more than $7,000.\n\nAuthorities say that in June, Francis was outside the Cortez Clam Factory casing a 2003 BMW. According to officials, he asked the bartender inside the restaurant to give him a flashlight and then went back outside and ransacked the BMW, taking a \"makeup pouch, wallet, gold wedding ring, gold diamond band, earrings, press credentials and $100 in cash,\" TMZ reports.\n\nTwo days later, Francis walked into a Florida police department carrying a plastic bag full of the stolen goods and told police, \"I just robbed somebody; take me to jail. I'm turning myself in,\" TMZ reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot knowing what Francis was talking about, confused police let him go. Now, TMZ reports, police have issued a felony burglary warrant for Francis and want him extradited ASAP.\n\nHow did a man who was nicknamed \"Franchise\" for his ability to turn a team into a winning organization fall so far? How did an NBA player's body that once looked cut up like a bag of dope fall to saggy skin and curved shoulders? It's like the Stevie Francis that used to be is folding into the Stevie Francis that is now.\n\nSteve Francis was never supposed to be here. He was never supposed to be in the NBA after losing his mother. He was never supposed to make it after falling from being a local Takoma Park, Md., hero to being a junior college sideshow. He was never supposed to make it to the NBA, but he did. His story is the kind of legend for which movie producers Birdman-hand rub.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrancis grew up in Takoma Park. He was nicknamed \"Wink,\" and it was obvious from early on, playing pickup games inside the Takoma Park firehouse, that Francis was gifted. In 1995, during his senior year of high school, his mother died of cancer at just 39. Francis' grandmother stepped in and guided him through two junior colleges before he landed at the University of Maryland. The hometown boy became the hometown college hero. From the day he arrived, he came with lofty expectations. He was hailed by some as \"Allen Iverson with discipline.\"\n\nHe would star at Maryland for one year before being taken No. 2 overall by the then Vancouver Grizzlies in the 1999 draft. He publicly announced that he didn't want to play for the Grizzlies, saying that he didn't want his grandmother to have to travel from Maryland to Canada just to see him play. He didn't even think about asking her to uproot her life for him. She already had.\n\nHe was granted his wish and traded to the Houston Rockets, where he shone. During his time with the Rockets, he averaged 19.3 points, 6.4 assists and 6.1 rebounds. He would be traded to the Orlando Magic and then to the New York Knicks and then back to the Rockets, where he was a shell of his old self. At the tender age of 30, Francis had flamed out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA man who once made three consecutive NBA All-Star teams now couldn't even land in the Chinese Basketball Association. In fact, video of him checking into a game with an ice pack still wrapped around his ankle became a joke shared on late-night news. The franchise was now the punch line.\n\nThen the videos kept coming. There was the one of a seemingly intoxicated Francis inside a packed nightclub singing \"Drunk in Love\" and the video of him getting choked out by former NBA player Stephen Jackson in a Houston nightclub. And the countless photos showing the onetime Terrapin slowly morphing into a turtle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe photos were so shocking that there was social media speculation that Francis was hooked on dope, rumors that Francis denied.\n\nA source close to Francis claimed that there were no health issues and that Francis was just old. Francis is 39.\n\nWhatever the issue, my hope is that the man who once came in second to Vince Carter in the 2000 dunk contest finds his wings again, because this isn't a good look.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStephen A.

Now I happen to like it. It was well-acted, moving and is probably the second best Marvel movie after Captain America: Winter Soldier, but that\u2019s just me. All black people don\u2019t have to like the Black Panther movie, people like different kinds of movies just like they like different kinds of ice cream. However, what you can\u2019t do is be lactose intolerant, walk into Cold Stone Creamery complain that they didn\u2019t have a non-dairy version of butter cream confetti birthday cake, then write a thousand word think piece on how the ice cream industrial complex is misleading black folks. Yet, like clockwork late night college dorm cypher masquerading as revolutionary Twitter and blackademia are out in force saying Eric Killmonger was right, that the Black Panther movie is anti-revolution and that the white dude got too much screen time. There are plenty of legitimate critiques of Black Panther, but these aren\u2019t it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s get the big one out of the way first. Killmonger wasn\u2019t right. I know that people are having #expressyourunpopularopinion orgasms on Twitter, and I get it, folks are out there hustling for contrarian hot-takes on one of the most successful super hero films of all time to get clicks on their Soundcloud while blocking any disagreement. That\u2019s just social media. Doesn\u2019t mean any of the critiques are right, and most aren\u2019t. Eric Killmonger (who is the best Marvel villain of all time, since Loki really doesn\u2019t count as a villain) defeats T\u2019Challa in ritual combat, takes over as King of Wakanda and Black Panther, and vows to use Wakanda\u2019s advanced weapons to arm oppressed black peoples all over the world. Some people found Killmonger\u2019s aims to be noble and that the Black Panther movie was overt propaganda against revolutionary politics. Or some academics felt the movie demonized black American men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat black revolutionary thought are these folks reading? Killmonger\u2019s desire to free black people from oppression was noble, but his methods were ridiculous and his motives were questionable. Wakandans didn\u2019t resist Killmonger because of his ideas, they didn\u2019t agree with his methods, which were, again, ridiculous. black revolution in America hasn\u2019t failed because we don\u2019t have enough guns, it fails because white folks outnumber us 10 to 1, and that\u2019s in some major metropolitan areas. Weapons for self-defense or chasing the cops and the Klan out of your neighborhood are one thing, but going to war against the United States would mean the extermination of black people no matter how many Vibranium shielded rhinos you shipped to Ferguson. Now if Killmonger had wanted to turn Wakanda into a refuge for oppressed blacks across the globe, or bankrupt the imperialist powers in Europe and America by creating a single African currency based on Vibranium I\u2019m pretty sure T\u2019Challa would have at least been willing to check out a Powerpoint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThing is though, he didn\u2019t have a good plan, no matter how his supporters try to spin it. More importantly Killmonger\u2019s plan wasn\u2019t intentionally bad because Ryan Coogler wanted to discredit revolution, it was bad because there are still a lot of people dumb enough to think that black freedom in America can be achieved through direct combat. Peaceful Black Lives Matter activists get shot on the daily, what do you think would happen to a militarized black uprising?\n\nSpeaking of militancy, the notion that Black Panther is propaganda for incrementalist reform instead of wide scale revolution can only occur to you if you didn\u2019t watch the movie. Wakandans are a never-colonized, ethnocentric isolationist theocratic monarchy. In other words, the country is run by a royal family that worships a magical cat, and they don\u2019t care about anybody or anything beyond their borders, regardless of race. Heck, M\u2019Baku points out that no Black Panther had visited Jabari-Land for a thousand years and that was like a 15 minute hover bike trip from Panther Palace. How would it make sense in this movie for this nation to move from isolationists to pan-African revolutionaries in a few hours just because a guy dressed like Lil Fizz from B2K showed up with some fighting skills and a tattoo on his lip? Killmonger wants revolution, but only if he is in charge, W\u2019Kabi wants imperialism and Nakia wants humanitarianism, and T\u2019Challa is figuring out how to move Wakanda forward and how to get his girl back. Which brings us to the white man in the middle, Agent Ross. Some critics feel the need to center him in the movie, it\u2019s snarky and sloppy pop culture commentary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only reason Agent Ross was in Wakanda is because he took a bullet for the girl that the king was sweating. Notice the Wakandas weren\u2019t sharing Kimoyo beads with all those dead South Koreans lying around after Killmonger freed Klaue. After that they called him colonizer, locked him in a room and when he volunteered to help overthrow Killmonger; Shuri, T\u2019Challa and Nakia gave him the collective, \u201cOh, you\u2019re still here?\u201d look. The Wakandans never trusted, embraced or fully accepted Agent Ross; he was caught up in a palace coup and proved to be useful. If you think Black Panther spent too much time or gave too much focus on Ross you probably think Get Out was really about Detective LaToya and the inner workings of the TSA.\n\nHollywood doesn\u2019t make revolutionary movies, and even movies that \u2018look\u2019 revolutionary are really status quo propaganda. In every Planet of the Apes movie, even after years of being experimented on and oppressed, the monkeys that want justice and revenge on humanity are always the bad guys. In the X-Men movies even though Magneto is right every ... single ... time, he\u2019s the bad guy. In Django Unchained despite being a former slave himself Django cares nothing about freeing others, all he wants is to get his wife back. In other words, Hollywood movies only say violent revolution is okay if the oppressors are robots or aliens that we can\u2019t have sex with (notice why they had so much trouble in Battlestar Galactica?)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, none of these critiques apply to Black Panther, the movie isn\u2019t anti-revolution, it\u2019s a about the best way for black people to carry out our obligations to each other, wrapped up in a coup, and a bunch of CGI and fancy costumes. Killmonger\u2019s goal was noble, but his methods were nonsense and a-historical. Let\u2019s save the concern trolling think pieces until the next Tyler Perry movie, they\u2019re much more worthy candidates for this kind of scorn.", "keywords": ["black", "panther", "wrong", "yall", "movie", "revolutionary", "didnt", "killmonger", "revolution", "know", "movies", "wants", "think"], "polarity": 0.027858126721763094, "subjectivity": 0.4477436704709431},

Something about a nerdtastic property holding such cultural significance put me in a state of bliss. So, I made a return trip, you know, to make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything. (Yeah, sure. That\u2019s the only reason.)\n\n\n\nDuring the second viewing, something occurred to me regarding Erik \u201cI shouldn\u2019t like you as much as I do\u201d Stevens, aka Killmonger. I hesitate to call him a villain. A villain drudges up images of some huge, purple-skinned menace trying to fetch some mystical stones, a threat so powerful that the next Marvel installment, Avengers: Infinity War must be divided into two parts.\n\nKillmonger is more of an adversary, an antagonist you feel for because his motives are all too real. Black folks can relate to being done with the world\u2019s bullshit, and I can guarantee that some of us left the theatre wondering what we\u2019d do if we had access to all of Wakanda\u2019s resources. Klaue? He can go die in a fire for stealing our stuff and calling us \u201csavages,\u201d but you not-so-secretly hope that Killmonger and T\u2019Challa will come together, especially when you realize that Black Panther isn\u2019t just peak Afrofuturism: it\u2019s revisionist history.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel is no stranger to telling a story within the context of actual historical events; just think O Captain, My Captain (America), with his patriotic shield and penchant for punching Nazis. It adds a fantastic layer to these otherworldly stories; the knowledge of some grand superpower existing during our darkest hours. That\u2019s what Captain America stood for; even before the super soldier program, Steve Rogers was full of heart and optimism, a little guy who wanted to help the little guy.\n\nBut it\u2019s much easier for an all-American white soldier to take a chance than for an African king. This time around, I peeped them slave ships in that opening narration, so don\u2019t expect the Black Panther to jump at the chance to help the good ol\u2019 US of \u201cAye, we\u2019re gonna enslave your people and take them to this stolen land\u2014we mean, shared equally with the Natives\u2014Happy Thanksgiving.\u201d\n\nStill, that\u2019s Killmonger\u2019s entire beef with the Wakandans. They\u2019ve had every opportunity to help black folks, but chose to stay hidden. King T\u2019Chaka was so set on this that he killed his own brother\u2014and Killmonger\u2019s father\u2014N\u2019Jobu. That is classic revenge motivation, but it becomes more complex (and tragic) when you realize what was happening back in 1992, the year Killmonger was orphaned by his own people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from the fact that it\u2019s close to director Ryan Coogler\u2019s hometown of Richmond, CA, on the surface, Oakland, California in 1992 doesn\u2019t seem too significant. During my first viewing of the movie, I thought they were simply pulling a Civil War, which recalled the date when Tony Starks\u2019 parents were killed. But while the opening of Black Panther is a variation on this theme, when Zuri later tells the story to T\u2019Challa, we see N\u2019Jobu pleading with his brother to help their black American brethren fight violence and over-policing; everything we the people of 2018 know to have been a harsh reality for generations.\n\nSomething about \u201cover-policing\u201d and \u201c1992\u201d stuck with me after my second viewing of Black Panther, so I relied on my good friend Google to uncover what was in the back of my mind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1992 is when the Los Angeles riots took place. Rodney King, y\u2019all. Yes, in addition to everything else, Black Panther went there.\n\n\n\nOf course, the riots didn\u2019t take place in Oakland, but you best believe the character of N\u2019Jobu would\u2019ve heard about them. Leaving your black utopian society to learn about the police, the supposed protectors of the country you\u2019re surveilling, beating the shit out of a black man? And getting away with it? N\u2019Jobu was in America during one of the most well-publicized atrocities toward the black community.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImagine living in Wakanda, a world where black folks are treated with love and respect, then being sent out and bearing witness to Rodney-fucking-King. The riots could\u2019ve easily been the tipping point, the moment N\u2019Jobu decided that his people needed to do something. It was certainly better than the alternative: the riots happening after his death, leaving his son\u2014who would ultimately become Killmonger\u2014alone to deal with it. It certainly makes little Erik\u2019s line about everyone dying around them more heartbreaking, especially since he sheds no tears.\n\nAs a man, however, Erik Stevens/Killmonger does cry, because he realizes what he\u2019s become as he sits in the ancestral plane with his father. And even amongst all that violence and death, N\u2019Jobu still had dreams of showing his son life as it could be in Wakanda. He wanted to bring his son home\u2014or perhaps, he wanted to create that home in our country. Witnessing the power of Vibranium in this narrative, that single stolen vial could\u2019ve started a revolution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, here is your villain/anti-hero: Erik Killmonger, left fatherless in a world full of so-called protectors that abuse his brethren. He\u2019d grow up to see more men, women, and children go through the same ordeal or worse than Rodney King, only to become social media hashtags. He\u2019d grow up hearing us tell wistful stories of the \u201cMotherland,\u201d while simultaneously dealing with white folks telling us to \u201cgo back to Africa,\u201d as if we chose to be here in the first place.\n\nAnd yet Killmonger would also know that his family in that far-off prosperous land would kill one of their own to keep their land and resources safe; only to later sign the Sokovia Accords to police those with superpowers. So, he decided that he\u2019d create \u201cThe Motherland,\u201d for himself and for us. Villain or not, Killmonger was willing to start from the ground up to let them know who we are. It\u2019s so understandable that even T\u2019Challa snapped at his ancestors to tell them they\u2019d been wrong.\n\n\n\nThe idea of us being one tribe, as T\u2019Challa says in the mid-credits scene, works both ways. The betterment of our people will resonate with us all, but that also means that the brutality against our people connects us. No one knew that better than Killmonger. I imagine T\u2019Challa respected his cousin\u2019s wishes to bury him in the ocean, but I hope his influence will live with the Black Panther legacy for generations to come.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWakanda Forever.", "keywords": ["help", "riots", "black", "panther", "tchalla", "folks", "king", "history", "killmonger", "know", "cant", "njobu", "revisionist"], "polarity": 0.09868718238283454, "subjectivity": 0.4717369737750173},

If I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d think that the current administration emboldens this brand of hate and then preys on white America\u2019s fear by pulling out tired tropes about gang violence to avoid the obvious issues of homegrown hate and unbridled access to guns.\n\nWatch below:", "keywords": ["gang", "sessions", "jeff", "nonsensical", "shooting", "school", "symphony", "speech", "think", "way", "laws", "florida", "gun", "parkland", "know", "violence", "racist", "whistles"], "polarity": -0.06926666666666667, "subjectivity": 0.5059333333333333},

Chris Murphy\u2019s calls to finally rein in America\u2019s gun problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe then asked the most useless rhetorical question one could ask, and yet is the thrust of every conservative talking point about gun control: \u201cIs this a problem with the gun or the shooter?\u201d (Hint: You can actually address both, and should, but whatever. Let\u2019s move on.)\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take a look at the gun, the AR-15, what makes it so popular and, overwhelmingly, what makes it so safe\u2014what it takes to get one,\u201d she continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham then introduces her guest, a \u201csecurity and counterterror expert\u201d by the name of Aaron Cohen, but not before launching into a quick brag break about her proficiency and experience with guns, telling viewers that she\u2019s shot gun since she was 6 years old. This, of course, qualifies her to discuss gun control policy much in the same way that someone whose sole qualification of eating McDonald\u2019s cheeseburgers since they were 6 years old qualifies them to steer conversations around obesity and food and health policy.\n\nAgain, moving on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like all weapons,\u201d Ingraham continued. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous in the hands of the wrong person. And if you\u2019re not trained, and if you have a criminal disposition, a violent disposition, it can be turned into a killing machine. But Chris Murphy wants to make this tonight all about the weapons.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, a person with a violent disposition can certainly turn a meat cleaver, a shank or a pot of hot grits into a killing machine. That person would also amass a far lower body count. In 2016, a man in China broke into a school and stabbed 10 children before turning the knife on himself. He was the only casualty\u2014all the children survived.\n\nMeanwhile, the AR-15, as HuffPost notes, was developed for battle and \u201cspecifically designed to kill people as efficiently as possible.\u201d By USA Today\u2019s count, the AR-15 has also been the weapon of choice for eight deadly mass shootings in the last three years. It was used in Sandy Hook in Newtown, Conn.; at the Pulse Night Club in Orlando, Fla.; in San Bernardino, Calif.; and in Las Vegas.\n\nA gun expert told USA Today that the \u201cbad rap\u201d the rifle receives is likely due to \u201ccopycat\u201d killers buying the gun after seeing it featured prominently in these shootings. But it should also be noted that it\u2019s not terribly difficult to get these weapons: According to a 2016 article from The Tab, a 20-year-old man with an expired license was able to purchase an AR-15 in 20 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Florida, for example, while buyers are supposed to pass a background check, there is no waiting period to purchase the AR-15; nor must a user register the gun. As more details about the gunman, Nikolas Cruz, emerge, it\u2019s clear that his school identified him as a threat: At one point, he wasn\u2019t allowed to bring a backpack to campus, one math teacher said, and he was eventually expelled. He also appears to have been a domestic abuser, but was never hit with any charges.\n\nA violent disposition\u2014but one that would pass the background checks that Florida requires.\n\nOutside of the Fox News universe, students and faculty from Douglas High literally begged lawmakers and President Donald Trump to take action:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham, like much of her ilk, wasn\u2019t concerned with listening to these students and educators who just witnessed their classmates, their students and their colleagues mowed down in another gruesome act of violence. While Ingraham was praising the AR-15, a smudged gray cross sat prominently on her forehead\u2014indicating the observance of Ash Wednesday, a day of penitence. A day to express remorse and sorrow. Shame.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for observers to reflect on their mortality, and their sinfulness before God.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dishonest discourse around gun control dished out by conservatives and sponsored by the National Rifle Association is a sin.

It was a warm, caring and very emotional speech that we know wasn\u2019t heartfelt because he expressed his true feelings on Twitter around 4 this morning:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTranslation: It\u2019s the students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 fault that the shooting occurred, and they should have screamed about this dangerous kid more. But the fact is, the FBI was warned last year about how Nikolas Cruz posted that he wanted to be a professional school shooter!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the president spoke Thursday around 11:30 a.m. EST, he took all of six-and-a-half-minutes to address the tragedy. That\u2019s less time than he took to rant about NFL players kneeling; that\u2019s less time than he took to praise alleged wife beater and former White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter; that\u2019s barely more time than it takes for Doug E. Fresh to go on.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t name any of the victims; nor did he praise the brave students or teachers. He spent most of his limited time giving an \u201cafter-school special\u201d lecture about how you never need to be alone in high school\u2014and if you\u2019re sad, there is someone you should reach out to. It was a speech seemingly intended to touch the heart of the next shooter out there who apparently just needs a hug in order to not murder his classmates.\n\nMind you, if this wasn\u2019t the most divisive president in the history of presidents, then maybe his entreaties for peace and love would make a difference, but he is who he is, so his pleas don\u2019t hold weight and they won\u2019t change anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most glaring part of the speech came at the end, when the president pledged that America must \u201ctackle the difficult issue of mental health.\u201d He didn\u2019t say \u201cguns\u201d once in his speech. Trump took pains to make no mention of guns. If Tim Gunn had jumped in front of him, ripped off his well-tailored sleeves, flexed and screamed, \u201cWhat do you think of these??\u201d Trump would still have found a way to say, \u201cHow\u2019s that mental health going?\u201d\n\nMental health has become the ultimate red herrng for Republicans who don\u2019t want to talk about guns no matter who gets shot, or how bloody or egregious and avoidable the crime may have been. The country is full of people with \u201cmental health problems,\u201d and they aren\u2019t shooting up schools every week. You know who is shooting up schools and nightclubs and office buildings every week? People who are legally allowed to buy AR-15s. Fix that problem and maybe we can stop with the disingenuous chorus of tweets citing \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d every 60 hours.\n\nAlas, we know that Trump won\u2019t do anything; nor will Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell or House Speaker Paul Ryan. When Republicans can get shot up at their own baseball game and still refuse to pass meaningful gun legislation, there\u2019s no reason to think that another shooting of innocent kids will spur them to action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as student survivor David Hogg just told CNN, somebody has to act like adults.\n\nSince Trump isn\u2019t an adult, and neither are the Republicans in Congress, it\u2019s time for the public to act like adults and vote these gun-fetishizing incompetents out of office this fall\u2014and then demand some real change.", "keywords": ["thats", "mental", "trump", "shootings", "dont", "school", "shooting", "health", "republicans", "speech", "pretend", "cares", "listened", "took", "president"], "polarity": 0.08694761904761902, "subjectivity": 0.45011904761904753},

Omar Delgado, one of the first police to respond to the massacre at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, is losing his job.\n\nHailed as a hero in the wake of the June 2016 mass shooting for saving the life of shooting victim Angel Colon, Delgado has since suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. As the Orlando Sentinel reports, after the massacre that left 49 people dead, Delgado returned to patrol duty with the Eatonville, Fla., Police Department for a few months but had to stop.\n\nHe told CNN that he has had trouble sleeping and suffered from nightmares, depression and anxiety. Delgado eventually took a desk job with the department, performing administrative duties for the past eight months.\n\nThen, this past Monday, the Eatonville PD told Delgado that his last day would be at the end of the month. Delgado is not sure exactly why he\u2019s being let go, and city officials wouldn\u2019t comment on the case, citing privacy policies. The officer says that a doctor had found him unfit to resume full duties because of his PTSD, which he believes was a factor in the city\u2019s decision to fire him.\n\nBut Delgado\u2014a nine-and-a-half-year veteran of the department\u2014is being forced out just six months before he can receive his full retirement pension and disability benefits. If he made the 10-year mark, the 45-year-old officer could receive 64 percent of his salary and benefits for life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe timing of Delgado\u2019s firing, however, means that Delgado is entitled to disability or a retirement pension, but not both, according to WESH-TV. As it stands, Delgado will only receive 42 percent of his salary (his disability pension), which will kick in when he turns 55.\n\nDelgado said that the departmental policy was news to him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to be a police officer with my gun belt and so forth to do those little tasks,\u201d Delgado said about his administrative work. \u201cCould they have let me do that for six more months? That\u2019s the debate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Time magazine notes, Delgado isn\u2019t the first officer who responded to the Pulse-nightclub shooting to be fired following a PTSD diagnosis. The Orlando Police Department let go Officer Gerry Realin, 37, in July. However, Realin will receive 80 percent of his $70,000 salary each year for the rest of life. Compare that with Delgado, who stands to receive 42 percent of his $38,5000 salary annually.\n\nBut Eatonville, the home of Zora Neale Hurston and the oldest incorporated African-American town in the country, is reportedly strapped for cash. The Eatonville Town Council, following a harsh backlash to news of Delgado\u2019s firing (WESH-TV reports that city officials have received death threats), voted unanimously to give Delgado an additional $1,200. The city also said that it would continue to help the officer with PTSD counseling.\n\nA blog posted on Psychology Today says that out of roughly 900,000 sworn officers in the U.S., approximately 19 percent may have PTSD. Some research also suggests that another 34 percent of law enforcement officers may suffer from symptoms of PTSD but \u201cdo not meet the standards for the full diagnosis.\u201d (Note: This blog also tells us to take time to \u201csmile at a cop,\u201d since their jobs are so stressful, which is cute but also horseshit. Cops suffering from PTSD need real institutional support, and it\u2019s unclear whether Delgado really received it.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrently, PTSD is not covered by workers\u2019 compensation in Florida. As the Orlando Sentinel notes, a proposed bill requiring first responders with PTSD to receive coverage for mental health treatment in their workers\u2019 compensation packages advanced this week in the Florida Senate.\n\nAngel Colon, the man whose life Delgado saved last year, told Fox 35 that the Eatonville Police Department should support the veteran officer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a horrible feeling because this man, Omar, has been there for me ever since June 12,\u201d Colon said, according to the Sentinel. \u201cHe\u2019s the person who saved my life.\u201d", "keywords": ["officer", "salary", "life", "job", "lose", "ptsd", "eatonville", "orlando", "months", "massacre", "pension", "pulse", "suffering", "delgado", "receive", "cop"], "polarity": 0.020723684210526307, "subjectivity": 0.3847953216374269},

It was born in the freedom movement, against the backdrop of the Watts rebellion, the rise of the Black Panther Party, the FBI\u2019s COINTELPRO and the assassination of Malcolm X (el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz).\n\n\n\nMaulana Karenga, professor and chair of Africana studies at California State University, is often credited as the sole creator of Kwanzaa, while the collective efforts of the Us Organization\u2014a black liberation group founded in 1966 by Karenga and Malcolm X\u2019s cousin Hakim Abdullah Jamal\u2014are minimized to prop up Karenga as a revolutionary messiah of Pan-African culture.\n\nJamal ultimately ended his association with Karenga as a result of clashes over ideological and organizational differences, but Kwanzaa continued to grow in popularity despite a war, fueled by COINTELPRO, between Us and the Southern California chapter of the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense. Even without FBI interference, there was an intracommunity battle for the allegiance of young black radicals intensifying between Us and the BPP. It was the machinations of the FBI, though, that ultimately drove Us members to murder Alprentice \u201cBunchy\u201d Carter, leader of the BPP\u2019s Southern California chapter, and his comrade John Huggins on Jan. 17, 1969, on UCLA\u2019s campus.\n\nHow do we grapple with the reality that the freedom dreams of some black men do not include free black women?\n\nDespite this tramautic history\u2014or, perhaps, because of it\u2014it is important to position Kwanzaa as freedom work and not the whitewashed, often commercialized version we may see today during public school recitals. The seven principles\u2014unity (Umoja), self-determination (Kujichagulia), collective work and responsibility (Ujima), cooperative economics (Ujamaa), purpose (Nia), creativity (Kuumba) and faith (Imani)\u2014serve as a survival blueprint for black people in this nation and around the world. This is why Kwanzaa has grown so much larger than its regional origins. These seven days, for many black people, feed an ancestral need for connection to the African roots from which we were so brutally ripped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what happens when black men crying freedom don\u2019t adhere to their own moral compass?\n\n\n\nIn 1971, five years after Kwanzaa\u2019s founding, Karenga was convicted of felonious assault and false imprisonment for torturing two women at his Inglewood, Calif., home, crimes for which he served four to five years in prison.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported on May 13, 1971:\n\nDeborah Jones, who once was given the Swahili title of an African queen, said she and Gail Davis were whipped with an electrical cord and beaten with a karate baton after being ordered to remove their clothes. She testified that a hot soldering iron was placed in Miss Davis\u2019 mouth and placed against Miss Davis\u2019 face and that one of her own big toes was tightened in a vise. Karenga, head of US, also put detergent and running hoses in their mouths, she said. They also were hit on the heads with toasters.\n\nKarenga has also been accused of rape by people within his community. Today, though, he seems to be too beloved or, perhaps, inconsequential for any criticism of him to matter. In 2006, Rosemary Lytle, president of the Colorado Springs NAACP branch and communications director of the ACLU Colorado, told The Gazette that she was not even aware of Karenga\u2019s past and that it didn\u2019t change her thoughts on Kwanzaa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t diminish, for me, Kwanzaa, because Kwanzaa is not based on any kind of charismatic personality or a personality of any sort, but more on community,\u201d Lytle said.\n\nThis may be true, since the creation of Kwanzaa was a collective endeavor, but the question remains: With what \u201ccommunity\u201d in mind?\n\nKarenga\u2019s history of violence against black women\u2014more specifically, the widespread willful ignorance of it\u2014is both disturbing and instructive, particularly in the #MeToo era.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen organizer and activist Tarana Burke created \u201cMe Too\u201d over a decade ago, she did so to create a safe space for black women and girls who had been victimized in their homes, in their schools and in their churches. She did it for the black women and girls who suffer in silence. She did it for black women and girls who are deemed collateral damage in the service of the so-called greater good\u2014in this context, protecting black men from the blunt force of the state by not reporting them for rape and/or abuse.\n\n\n\nWhat we see in the protection of Karenga is black women\u2019s pain, black women\u2019s bodies and black women\u2019s stories\u2014black women\u2014being thrown into the trash bin of history. Even now, though there are numerous articles discussing the charges against Karenga, some links are broken or no longer available. I\u2019m sure that in a few years, there will be fewer articles still, until all talk of Karenga\u2019s crimes will be reduced to white supremacist myth.\n\nWhen framing Pan-Africanism as a racist fail, white supremacists often use Karenga\u2019s violent past to undermine Kwanzaa\u2019s credibility\u2014and that troubles some who observe Kwanzaa. Distancing themselves from Karenga means that the racists win\u2014so how to reconcile Karenga\u2019s violence against black women with the Pan-African week of observation that he created?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore generally, how do we grapple with the reality that the freedom dreams of some black men do not include free black women?\n\n\n\nHow do we insist on modeling forward-facing movements that do not deify and protect those who would harm black women, but instead cast them out?\n\n\n\nHow do we do all of this while calling out the hypocrisy of a nation that either vilifies or whitewashes Kwanzaa because of the actions of its main architect, but will honor, with complete sincerity, the genocidal colonizers of the land on which we stand?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWriting for the Los Angeles Sentinel last week, Karenga shared that this year\u2019s Kwanzaa theme is \u201cPracticing the Principles of Kwanzaa: Repairing, Renewing and Remaking.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs old heteropatriarchal templates for movement building are being thrust aside for a movement that demands accountability for crimes against black women and the LGBTQ+ community\u2014as well as clear, unapologetic investment in the material conditions of our lives and trust in our leadership\u2014this is perfect timing for such a theme.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn Henrik Clarke made it clear that Karenga went to prison for \u201cmutilating black women.\u201d The Kwanzaa founder has \u201cnot atoned to the community for his attempt to destroy the Panther movement. He has not atoned for being a police informant. He has not atoned for the way he treated black women,\u201d Clarke is also quoted as saying.\n\n\n\nNot only has he not atoned, but Karenga cast himself as a political prisoner instead of owning his actions\u2014including, but not limited to, his violence against black women.\n\nPerhaps, in the spirit of Kwanzaa and this year\u2019s theme, he should start practicing there.", "keywords": ["movement", "black", "maulana", "community", "karenga", "freedom", "legacy", "atoned", "kwanzaa", "women", "revisiting", "karengas", "men"], "polarity": 0.017598967297762492, "subjectivity": 0.47006119716963085},

Kelley, who was known to have a violent past, should not have been able to buy firearms and body armor because of his domestic violence conviction back in 2014 while serving at the Halloman Air Force Base in New Mexico.\n\nHowever, according to the Washington Post, the Air Force has admitted that it dropped the ball and failed to follow the appropriate procedures to alert federal authorities about Kelley\u2019s past, thus enabling the former airman to purchase weapons before he attacked a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, killing more than 20 people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKelley had been court-martialed while in the Air Force and was ultimately convicted in 2014 for abusing his wife and his stepchild. He was sentenced to a year in prison before being kicked out of the military with a bad-conduct discharge.\n\n\u201cInitial information indicates that Kelley\u2019s domestic violence offense was not entered into the National Criminal Information Center database,\u201d Air Force spokesperson Ann Stefanek said in a statement Monday.\n\nStefanek added that Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson and Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein have ordered an investigation into Kelley\u2019s case and \u201crelevant policies and procedures.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Times notes that under federal law, Kelley\u2014who assaulted his wife and toddler stepson to the point where he cracked the child\u2019s skull\u2014should not have been able to legally purchase the military-style rifle and the three other guns that he had accumulated over the past few years.\n\nThe Times reports that federal law has about 11 criteria that would prevent someone from purchasing a gun. Two of them, it appears, would apply in Kelley\u2019s case: conviction of a crime punishable by more than a year in prison\u2014i.e., the assault of his stepson, which carried a maximum sentence of five years\u2014and conviction of a domestic violence misdemeanor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Air Force will also be investigating whether other convictions had not been reported to the federal database for firearms background checks, according to the Times.\n\nAcademy Sports, a firearms retailer, confirmed Monday that Kelley had bought two weapons from its stores after clearing federal background checks this year and last year, according to the Post. It is still not clear whether those weapons were the ones that were used in Sunday\u2019s massacre, but nonetheless, it showcases the Air Force\u2019s failure to follow Pentagon guidelines in making sure that certain violent offenses get reported to the FBI.\n\nA separate law should have prevented Kelley, a violent offender, from purchasing the body armor that he was seen wearing during the mass shooting.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGeoffery Corn, a former Army lawyer and a professor at the South Texas College of Law, told the Post that there seems to be some confusion in the armed forces about what gets reported to authorities.\n\nThe Post notes:\n\nCorn said it appears there is confusion within the Air Force, and other military branches, about only reporting violent crimes that result in dishonorable discharges, which are more severe punishments under military law than the bad-conduct discharge Kelley received. \u201cEither the Department of Defense is reporting these convictions, or they\u2019re not,\u201d Corn said. \u201cHow is the federal statute going to be effectively implemented if they aren\u2019t reporting these convictions?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Times notes that Kelley\u2019s bad-conduct discharge does not, in and of itself, mean an automatic ban from purchasing guns.\n\nFrom the Times:\n\nThe Department of Defense has reported only one domestic violence case to the federal database for gun purchase background checks, records show. It has reported 11,000 service members to the database, but almost all of them were because of dishonorable discharges, which prohibit gun purchases. Mr. Kelley, after serving 12 months in a Navy brig in California, received a \u201cbad conduct\u201d discharge, which is not by itself an automatic bar to gun purchases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the Washington Post and the New York Times.", "keywords": ["policies", "post", "texas", "firearms", "violent", "allowed", "law", "air", "reported", "federal", "kelleys", "buy", "shooter", "follow", "force", "kelley", "violence", "failure"], "polarity": -0.03561580086580088, "subjectivity": 0.4640624098124098},

According to The New York Times, this amounts to some 7% of the town\u2019s population. While details are still unspooling, the county sheriff told The Washington Post that a large number of the victims\u2014somewhere between 12 to 14 of the people who were killed and injured\u2014were children. According to state officials, a child as young as 18 months was among the dead.\n\n\n\nThe massacre in Texas is the deadliest mass shooting of children since Sandy Hook. People will mourn the loss of these young lives as a wake-up call for gun control. But while the shooting in Texas was undeniably gruesome, it was not a unique incident for children in this country. The fact is that in America, more children are shot on a daily basis than the number that were shot in Texas on Sunday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a study on children and firearm injuries, published in the journal Pediatrics in June by researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the University of Texas, approximately 19 children a day die or receive emergency treatment for a gunshot wound in the United States. The study, which is one of the most comprehensive of its kind, found that in total, between 2012 and 2014, an average of nearly 1,300 children died and 5,790 were treated for gunshot wounds every year.\n\nAnother analysis by The Washington Post using more recent data from 2015 found that on average, 23 children were shot each day that year. This is a uniquely American problem\u2014one study published in the American Journal of Medicine found that in 2010, among high-income countries, 91 percent of children aged 0 to 14 killed by firearms came from the United States.\n\nChildren are shot on a daily basis, but the epidemic largely gets swept under the rug outside of the shock of mass shootings like those in Texas and Sandy Hook. This might have to do with the racial disparity of which children are affected by gun violence\u2014according to the Pediatrics study, black children have the highest rate of firearm mortality overall, at 4.1 per 100,000 versus 1.5 per 100,000 for white children. While white and American Indian children have higher rates of death by firearm suicide, the disparity mostly results from black children having higher rates of death by firearm homicides. A huge proportion of these children who die from firearms overall\u201482 percent\u2014are male, and most are older, between the ages of 13 and 17.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat happened in Texas is horrifying. But as we go through the ritualistic steps of processing the massacres that have become woven into the fabric of American life, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that we simply can\u2019t talk about gun violence without addressing the fact that children, disproportionately black boys, are dying every day. And those who survive gun violence face ongoing trauma.\n\n\u201cWhen the physical wound is repaired, there\u2019s still another wound\u2014one that can be lifelong,\u201d Arthur Lurigio, a clinical psychologist, told ABC News earlier this year. \u201cOnce a child has been shot, their illusion of safety is completely and utterly shattered.\u201d\n\nAccording to another CDC report, increased risk for youth violence and crime is associated with many factors, including concentrated poverty, unemployment, crowded housing, and neighborhood violence and crime. When looking at the problem of gun violence and children as a whole, it\u2019s clear that tighter gun laws are an important, but only partial, solution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithout putting this reality at the front and center, the gun control debate has too much potential to err on the side of increasing the policing of minorities rather than fixing the root problems that engender gun violence. For example, as Patrick Blanchfield pointed out in an essay for n+1 last year, the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban was part of the larger crime bill signed into law by Bill Clinton that produced many of the frameworks for mass incarceration, like harsh sentencing guidelines and billions in funding for new prison construction. Blanchfield writes:\n\nGiven that today\u2019s Aversive Minimalists include many white liberals whose primary concerns vis-\u00e0-vis \u201cgun violence\u201d more or less boil down to making high-profile rampage killings disappear from their newsfeeds, the possibility that they will embrace measures that gesture at solving that problem while doubling down on militarized policing, surveillance, and America\u2019s overcrowded prisons is depressingly easy to imagine. As many critics have observed, we would be na\u00efve to think that heavy-handed gun control measures would not involve the same disproportionate racial targeting and police violence we rightly condemn in the War on Drugs and in everyday encounters in places from Baltimore to Ferguson to Cleveland to Oakland.\n\nThe gun control debate often swirls around the trends illuminated by the massacre of the month. By failing to focus on the overall issue\u2014one that is inextricably linked with poverty, segregation, and racism\u2014children will continue to suffer. That somewhere around a dozen children were shot in Texas on Sunday is a tragedy, but it\u2019s also one that families face across the country every single day.\n\n", "keywords": ["texas", "control", "firearm", "day", "number", "shot", "study", "kids", "american", "america", "gun", "violence", "children", "killed"], "polarity": 0.05063679288362833, "subjectivity": 0.4107891756625934},

Newton and Bobbly Seale had a brilliant idea.\n\nInitially conceived as a way to protect the black community against the oppressive presence and indiscriminate violence of the police in Oakland, Calif., the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense evolved into a organization that advocated for revolutionary black love, mass organizing and community programs in an effort to combat the institutional racism rampant in America and around the world.\n\nThe legacy of the Panthers has been deeply impacted by the federal government\u2019s attempts to destabilize the organization. They were portrayed as violent radicals intent on overthrowing the government, but the very animal chosen as a symbol for the group sheds light on what the organizers had in mind.\n\n\u201cThe symbol of the black panther was chosen because of its nature,\u201d said Huey P. Newton in an interview. \u201cIf you strike it, it will rear back. But if the aggressor continues, the panther will strike with deadly efficiency.\u201d\n\nThis was an organization founded with an eye for self-defense.\n\nWhen most people think of racist violence in the 1960s, they think of the Ku Klux Klan in Tennessee or Bull Connor in Birmingham, Ala. What is often overlooked is the way in which the police visited violence upon black, working-class communities in the North.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey did not call you a [n\u2014ger],\u201d said former Black Panther Sherwin Forte. \u201cBut they treated you just the same as in the South.\u201d\n\nThe Black Panther Party was not an organization led and populated by upper-middle-class, black, religious elites committed to nonviolence like the leaders of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. This was an organization full of people from the communities that were hardest hit by poverty, educational inequality and economic marginalization. These were members of the community taking it upon themselves to participate in their liberation\u2014and the way the group engaged in resistance sometimes troubled civil rights leaders who were given access to political power in the 1960s. They were confrontational and unapologetic in their critiques of white supremacy. Many dressed in a way that signified black cool and displayed the beauty of African identity\u2014and they married a Marxist critique of class to a critique of race.\n\nWhite progressives often offered a critique of class that marginalized its intersection with race for people of color. This prompted W.E.B. Du Bois to write Socialism and the Negro Problem in which he argues that one can actualize progressive economic policies and leave racism intact. Addressing economic concerns, he argues, will not address the racism experienced by African Americans. Enacting progressive economic policies will not automatically fix unfair hiring practices due to implicit and explicit bias.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, many in the civil rights movement emphasized race and did not say much about class. Martin Luther King Jr. later moved into a critique of what he deemed the triple evils of militarism, racism and materialism, but many black activists working at that time emphasized race without addressing how capitalistic exploitation contributed to a unique form of oppression affecting people of color.\n\nThe Panthers addressed both. They taught Marx in their meetings and offered free meals to those who otherwise would have gone without eating. They were receptive to revolutionary ideas if those holding those ideas were willing to include race in their program. The party\u2019s willingness to self-identify as radical makes it noteworthy; yet it is the impact of black women on the party that I find most remarkable.\n\n\u201cThe irony of the Black Panthers is that the image is one of a black man and a gun,\u201d says Clayborne Carson, historian at Stanford University. \u201cBut the reality is that the majority of the rank and file at the end of the \u201960s were women.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, many of the men in the party were patriarchal and held traditional, oppressive views of gender roles; however, many women in the movement were intentional about ensuring that their voices were heard and making room for the ideas of black women to be considered alongside their male counterparts. Former party Chairwoman Elaine Brown\u2019s famous saying was, \u201cWe didn\u2019t get these brothers from revolutionary heaven.\u201d\n\nDespite the U.S. government\u2019s infiltration of the movement with spies, assassination of key leaders and depiction of the party as an organization to be feared for its radicalism, the Panthers continue to inspire. They refused to apologize for loving black people and were profound in how they centered a black aesthetic and conceptual frame. Their influence can be seen in areas as diverse as free-lunch programs, African-American-studies departments and movements like the Black Lives Matter Network.\n\nThe Black Panther Party for Self-Defense was not perfect, but its members loved us\u2014and that\u2019s enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLawrence Ware is a progressive writer in a conservative state.

Bleak because the country\u2019s top public health organization is now prohibited from using the term \u201cscience-based.\u201d Bleak because we\u2019re surprised that a man accused of sexually harassing and assaulting young girls\u2014and who extols slavery\u2014lost an election. Bleak because the president of these United States stood in front of a portrait of former President Andrew Jackson and made a joke about Pocahontas while \u201chonoring\u201d Navajo code talkers. Bleak because all of these developments happened within the past month alone.\n\n\n\nThe criminal-justice system took a hard beating this year \u2014especially at the federal level. The Department of Justice\u2019s head honcho, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, directed all federal prosecutors (pdf) to seek the harshest charges possible in every criminal case, scaled back police department investigations, bolstered civil asset forfeiture, put military-grade weapons back in the hands of local police and expanded the federal government\u2019s role in immigration enforcement. Important crime statistics \u2014 including arrest data \u2014 were stripped from the FBI\u2019s annual crime report, which is typically used to assess national trends and develop potential solutions. Police officers are still getting away with killing unarmed civilians.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, this year was one of the worst in recent memory. But what if I told you that there\u2019s reason to hope \u2014 that there is still some good to latch on to?\n\n\n\nWell, there is. Here are 11 criminal-justice victories to prove it.\n\n\n\n1. New York and North Carolina \u201craised the age.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScientists, juvenile-justice experts and courts agree that kids and teenagers are different from adults. The part of the brain associated with decision-making is still underdeveloped, which renders them immature, reckless and impulsive. They are also heavily influenced by environmental factors, including family dynamics, trauma and income instability. But children across the country are still being prosecuted as adults in federal and local courts \u2014 sometimes automatically, sometimes at the discretion of a prosecutor or judge.\n\nThis year, New York and North Carolina passed legislation to \u201craise the age\u201d and will no longer automatically prosecute 16- and 17-year-olds as adults. Instead, these teenagers can legally be processed in the juvenile-justice system, which is better equipped to assess and tackle young people\u2019s unique needs, and aims to be rehabilitative, not punitive.\n\n\n\n2. The Senate passed critical juvenile-justice legislation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWay back in 1974, the federal government passed the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, agreeing that there should be a basic set of guidelines for approaching incarcerated youths. As outlined by the Coalition for Juvenile Justice, there were four major tenets of the legislation: Youths shouldn\u2019t be locked up with adults, they shouldn\u2019t be prosecuted as adults, they shouldn\u2019t be prosecuted for offenses that wouldn\u2019t be considered crimes if committed by adults, and there are racial disparities among detained youths that need to be reduced. With these ideas in mind, the JJDPA gave the federal government an opportunity to create a path for states and municipalities to follow \u2014 and fund them accordingly. But Congress has failed to reauthorize and update it since 2002.\n\n\n\nIn August, the Senate finally voted in favor of a bill to reauthorize the legislation, after passage of a sister bill in the House last year. Now that both houses of Congress have advanced legislation, they will hold a conference committee to consolidate the bills and send a final version to the president. But the fact that Congress is addressing JJDPA at all, after 15 years, counts as a victory.\n\n3. Some juvenile lifers were released from prisons.\n\nIn case you missed it, the Supreme Court has ruled, twice, that sentencing juveniles to life without parole is unconstitutional. In accordance with these rulings, many states have agreed to eliminate the harsh sentence, resentence those locked up before the landmark decisions and put parole back on the table.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, as Jessica Pishko wrote in The Nation, it is remarkably difficult for convicted lifers to get out of prison. Some prosecutors just push for another life sentence or another lengthy sentence, with parole as an option down the line. Waiting for a parole board to review a case can take years, and release comes with a major condition that people who claim innocence have to grapple with: an acknowledgment that they are responsible for the crime for which they\u2019ve spent a lifetime behind bars.\n\n\n\nDespite these challenges, some have made it out. There\u2019s Bobby Hines, who, at age 15, was sentenced to life without parole in Michigan for his connection to a murder. He didn\u2019t pull the trigger but has spent the last 28 years behind bars because prosecutors said he was responsible for the killing. There\u2019s Earl Rice Jr., who was 17 at the time he was locked up in a Pennsylvania prison for a robbery gone wrong. Rice has spent the past 43 years in prison because a woman he stole a purse from fell to the ground and fatally hit her head. There\u2019s also Giovanni Reid in Pennsylvania, who was found guilty of conspiracy in relation to a murder when he was 16. While the numbers are still small, these three count among dozens given another chance by the Supreme Court and states acknowledging that kids are kids.\n\n\n\n4. Thousands of convictions were dropped because of lab scandals in Massachusetts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor years, Annie Dookhan served as a drug-lab chemist, helping prosecutors build thousands of cases in Massachusetts. But by her own admission, she tampered with evidence, wrote false reports, failed to complete vital drug tests and lied about her credentials. In April, prosecutors decided to drop over 21,000 cases tied to Dookhan \u2014 many of which were prosecuted in Boston \u2014 rather than spend countless dollars and resources to retry all of them.\n\n\n\nIn November, prosecutors dismissed another 6,000 cases because of chemist Sonja Farak\u2019s illegal activity in another crime lab. In addition to tampering with evidence, Farak stole and used drugs from a lab at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and conducted most of her work over eight years while high.\n\n\n\n5. Louisiana passed a comprehensive reform package.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLouisiana has long been known as the incarceration capital of the world. In 2014 it had the highest incarceration rate, with nearly 40,000 people behind bars. Now there are about 36,000. As the state mulled over ways to fix this bleak reality, I was lucky to be one of many people to testify before the state\u2019s House Judiciary Committee about mass incarceration\u2019s disastrous impact on the population \u2014 and the whopping price tag that comes with it. In June, the legislature finally did something about the problem, passing a massive reform package to reduce the prison population by 10 percent in 10 years at the urging of Gov. John Bel Edwards.\n\n\n\nThe package includes a number of sentencing and parole reforms. Mandatory minimums were gutted for various offenses: theft, arson, drug possession and others. Judges now have more discretion to sentence violent offenders and repeat offenders. Prosecutors have more discretion to send people to diversion programs as an alternative to prison. There are no more automatic parole terms for low-level offenses, and judges can now shorten probation terms for some violent offenders and repeat offenders.\n\n\n\n6. A progressive district attorney candidate in Philadelphia won the election by a landslide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast month, Democratic candidate Larry Krasner not only won the race to become Philadelphia\u2019s next district attorney, but he won close to 75 percent of the vote. Krasner, who once called himself \u201ccompletely unelectable,\u201d has long been a thorn in the side of law enforcement. He notoriously sued Philadelphia officers for breaching civil rights 75 times. He has also spent much of his decadeslong career fighting for activists who have been criminalized by the government.\n\nHis platform was also one of the most progressive ones to date. He promised to end death penalty sentences, the prosecution of cases that involve stop-and-frisk, civil asset forfeiture and cash bail for nonviolent offenses. He vowed to treat addiction as a public health problem, to prosecute police engaged in misconduct and to protect immigrants.\n\nWith their overwhelming support, local voters declared that reform is necessary in the city with the highest incarceration rate among the 10 largest U.S. cities and rampant police abuse. The victory also continued a slow but growing national trend of prosecutorial candidates running on platforms to rethink and scale back tough-on-crime policies that have contributed to the bloated carceral population.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. New York City announced a plan to close Rikers Island.\n\nNew York City is famous for jailing thousands of criminal defendants pretrial\u2014the vast majority of whom can\u2019t afford bail \u2014 at Rikers Island. There, they face extreme violence and the rampant use of solitary confinement. Medical neglect is the norm. Many prisoners have been driven to suicide. The air is toxic.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the facility will be shuttered over the next 10 years and replaced with a smaller jail in each of the city\u2019s five boroughs. The decision was a response to recommendations made by the Independent Commission on New York City Criminal Justice and Incarceration Reform, which was assembled in 2016 at the urging of City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito. At the time of the announcement, roughly 9,360 people were detained at the facility.\n\n\n\n8. There are more eyes on prosecutors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice officers are easy to scrutinize for many reasons. They are the most public-facing law enforcement officials, and there is no shortage of stories about how they racially profile people, prey on marginalized groups, violate basic constitutional rights and kill. By and large, they get away with these behaviors. Considering all of this, it makes sense that activists, reporters and lawmakers have been critical of policing and have pushed for reform. But there\u2019s another group of law enforcement officials who deserve the same amount of scrutiny: local prosecutors.\n\n\n\nUnlike federal prosecutors operating under Jeff Sessions, prosecutors at the state, county and city levels have the discretion to file charges, request bail and fines and fees, establish plea deals and push for harsh sentences. While this is nothing new, more and more people are starting to understand the profound role that prosecutors play in driving mass incarceration.\n\nThe ACLU of California launched a campaign to educate voters about their local district attorneys and the policies they promote \u2014 including those that contradict what voters actually want. Journalists have also produced deep dives on prosecutors\u2019 abuses of power and misconduct, including Brady violations, the presentation of false evidence, questionable remarks made to jurors and a total lack of accountability. More eyes on these officials ultimately means that there can be a bigger push for accountability.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Use of the death penalty is still on the decline.\n\nAccording to the Death Penalty Information Center, which tracks national execution and death penalty sentencing, there were 23 executions this year. This marks the second-lowest number of executions in the past 25 years, and the continuation of a downward trend that\u2019s lasted nearly two decades. The total number of new death sentences, 39, was historically low as well, marking the second-lowest number of new death sentences in any year since 1972. Public support for the death penalty is also the lowest it has been since that year.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese trends can be attributed to a better understanding of how flawed cases can be because of science, juror bias and shady prosecutor behavior. Executions themselves are rife with problems, including but not limited to the fact that the drugs used to execute people are manufactured in unregulated pharmacies and don\u2019t work. The costs associated with the appeals process, detention and the execution process are also astronomical.\n\n\n\n10. Poor drivers in California got some relief.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was a time when motorists in the Golden State could have their driver\u2019s licenses suspended because they were too poor to pay traffic fines. This put them in a classic \u201cDamned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t\u201d scenario. Many people in this position still needed to drive to jobs where they earned what little money they had, at the risk of getting pulled over and accruing more tickets and fines that couldn\u2019t be paid. They still had to take kids to school. Some caught driving with a suspended license were jailed.\n\nIn June, Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation that put a stop to these license suspensions. The legislation will also be applied retroactively. This month, Alameda County became one of the first to reverse the suspensions in accordance with the new law \u2014 a move expected to affect 54,000 drivers.\n\n\n\n11. Multiple programs are helping formerly incarcerated people rebuild.\n\nRelease from prison can be incredibly complicated. On one hand, people get their freedom back. On the other hand, former prisoners often have no money, home or support system in place to truly get back on their feet. A criminal record can also prevent them from accessing social services that they would otherwise qualify for, and hurt their chances of securing a job or getting a college degree. Buying a bus ticket can be impossible. All of these obstacles perpetuate the cycle of poverty and incarceration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut more and more programs are starting to offer vital assistance upon re-entry, and this year was full of success stories. For instance, my campaign to end mass incarceration, FREEAMERICA, helped to launch Unlocked Futures. The project will fund, offer guidance to and promote new entrepreneurial ventures by people who were once locked up.\n\nIn Los Angeles, formerly incarcerated individuals have been hired for construction jobs and given an opportunity to build up their own communities. In fact, re-entry grants for health care, treatment programs and educational programming have been awarded throughout California. In Louisiana, criminal-justice advocates established a comprehensive re-entry plan to address the needs of people impacted by the criminal-justice overhaul.\n\n\n\nThis article was published in partnership with In Justice Today.\n\nJohn Legend is a 10-time Grammy Award winner, an Academy and Tony Award winner, a philanthropist and the founder of the #FreeAmerica campaign.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarimah Townes is a criminal-justice reporter for the Fair Punishment Project.

The video of the 2016 shooting was not released until after Brailsford was acquitted Thursday of second-degree murder charges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the wake of this horrific act of state violence, there has been some outrage. Black activists, as usual, have sounded the alarm, while the #AllLivesMatter trolls have remained predictably silent. This is not unusual in the aftermath of a white person being killed by cops. We witnessed this two years ago after police officers in Louisiana killed 6-year-old Jeremy Mardis.\n\nThis time, though, there have also been passive-aggressive and intellectually dishonest statements that pass judgment on the Movement for Black Lives for not taking to the streets and protesting on Shaver\u2019s behalf.\n\nWriting for The Atlantic, Conor Friedersdorf stops just short of blaming black people for a perceived lack of mainstream media coverage surrounding Shaver\u2019s death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDaniel Shaver\u2019s case is instructive,\u201d Friedersdorf writes. \u201cHis killing deserves more journalistic coverage as a matter of substance and more activist attention as a matter of strategy.\u201d\n\nThe author also writes that though he finds the movement \u201claudable\u201d for focusing on state violence against black people, \u201cpublicizing and protesting egregious instances of white people being killed would do as much to advance its agenda.\u201d\n\nFriedersdorf claims he believes that \u201cthe race-neutral policy reforms that the movement advances are long overdue,\u201d but in the next breath, he claims that the movement\u2019s \u201cexplicitly racial focus has been alienating to others, including those who don\u2019t believe that racism is a significant factor in police killings; those who put fighting racism low on their priority list; and anti-black racists.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe author links to Campaign Zero, founded by Brittany Packnett, Samuel Sinyangwe, DeRay Mckesson and Johnetta Elzie (who is no longer associated with Campaign Zero), as evidence of \u201cthe movement\u2019s\u201d \u201crace-neutral policy reforms.\u201d He does this even though Campaign Zero does not represent the Movement for Black Lives; even though the campaign is not associated with the Black Lives Matter Global Network in any capacity; and even though the campaign has platforms that tackle white supremacist policies, such as broken-windows policing.\n\n(Click here to read M4BL\u2019s comprehensive platform, which is unapologetically not race-neutral and calls for an end to the war on black people, reparations, political power, economic justice and community control.)\n\nFriedersdorf focuses on the benefits of so-called race neutrality, and not the movement\u2019s explicit focus on the most marginalized, targeted and oppressed communities in this country, for reasons that soon become clear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater in the piece, he mentions the \u201cdebate\u201d surrounding the veracity of claims that black people are disproportionately killed by police. He does this by sourcing an article from the National Review, known for being a racist publication, which claims that more black people are killed by police because more black people commit crimes.\n\nThe author doesn\u2019t want to dwell there, though, because it\u2019s \u201clargely irrelevant.\u201d\n\nNo, no, it\u2019s not.\n\nLet\u2019s make this plain: Black people are disproportionately killed by police officers in this country because they are black. That is not speculation. That is not up for debate. That is fact. It is fact that statistical analysis has shown that crime rates do not influence the rate by which police officers kill black people.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2016 the Washington Post\u2019s Wesley Lowery tackles the myth of black criminality being the root cause for increased police violence in black communities:\n\nA 2015 study by a University of California at Davis researcher concluded there was \u201cno relationship\u201d between crime rates by race and racial bias in police killings. A report released [pdf] ... by the Center for Policing Equity, which reviewed arrest and use-of-force data from 12 police departments, concluded that black residents were more often targeted for use of police force than white residents, even when adjusting for whether the person was a violent criminal. ... an independent analysis of The Post\u2019s data conducted by a team of criminal-justice researchers concluded that, when factoring in threat level, black Americans who are fatally shot by police are no more likely to be posing an imminent lethal threat to the officers at the moment they are killed than white Americans fatally shot by police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis does not even include arrest rates.\n\nAs The Root previously reported, New York City police make more arrests in working-class black and brown communities than they do in predominantly white communities, even when officers are responding to similar 911 or 311 calls in each of those communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack communities have been brutally and relentlessly tormented in ways that often seem unfathomable, and to even entertain the idea that police brutality and state violence are race-neutral is abhorrent. It is equally abhorrent to give such blatantly racist analysis breathing room under the guise of objectivity in order to make the point that a movement focused on the desecration of black lives must center white lives in order to be most effective.\n\nWe live in a nation where a 12-year-old child was gunned down in a police drive-by simply for playing in a park\u2014and the state insisted that he caused his own death.\n\nThe answer to that is not centering white lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a nation built on stolen land, genocide and slavery; in a country that has lynched and incarcerated black, brown and indigenous people with impunity, the audacity of anyone to slyly reprimand black organizers, activists and journalists for not spending enough time begging white people to see their own humanity\u2014in hopes that, in turn, the protection of whiteness will blanket us all\u2014is the most condescending and ill-advised analysis that I have read in quite some time.\n\nBlack activists are fighting for an end to white supremacy, the material ways in which whiteness poisons every single thing it touches. There is absolutely no redeeming value in a racial and political construct that, by design, empowers and protects one group of people while systemically dehumanizing another.\n\nThough we are living in a political zeitgeist where liberals are negotiating with \u201cthe white working class\u201d and calling it progress, it is not our job to save white folks from the very institutions they protect and pledge their allegiance to, black lives be damned. It is not our job to create space for \u201cthose who put fighting racism low on their priority list; and anti-black racists\u201d hoping that \u201crace-neutral\u201d calls for justice will activate their humanity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have told white people for a long, long time, that if they come for us in the morning, they will come for them in the night. We have said time and again that more white people will be collateral damage in a murderous, white supremacist system. We have warned over and over again that the house is burning, but white people continue to act shocked and awed when their loved ones are burned, and then blame black people for not abandoning their own children to bring back the hose.\n\nWhat else do they want from us?\n\nBlack people have put their lives on the line for this movement, and some have died because of it. Black journalists have lost countless hours of sleep reporting from the front lines and being arrested for doing so; some have stayed awake with tears in their eyes and rage in their hearts, amplifying through social media stories that mainstream media deemed unimportant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack activists are suffering with post-traumatic stress disorder, unable to bear the sound of fireworks because it reminds them of the sound of rubber bullets and tear gas. Black organizers are being surveilled by the state, and some fear they will be the next Fred Hampton.\n\nThere is no room for trickle-down progressivism in this movement. To suggest that black people are better served by focusing equally on saving white lives as a matter of \u201cstrategy\u201d\u2014effectively neutralizing the movement\u2014knowing the cost of protest and the heavy toll of movement work, is to show a blatant disregard for black lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDaniel Shaver did not deserve to die. The next Daniel Shaver will not deserve to die, either\u2014neither will the next Jeremy Mardis. It is up to white people to decide if their ignited desire for justice is greater than their apathy and, at times, hatred for black lives, because there is a movement already in progress.\n\nIt is not black people\u2019s job to create a White Lives Matter version of it to appease white sensibilities.\n\nIt is not our job to hunt for the morality within white people who would otherwise be content watching black people die.", "keywords": ["lives", "movement", "job", "danielshaver", "black", "raceneutral", "create", "campaign", "officers", "matter", "state", "white", "peoples", "killed"], "polarity": -0.045962101170434526, "subjectivity": 0.35431948452781753},

Yes, in addition to everything else, Black Panther went there.\n\n\n\nOf course, the riots didn\u2019t take place in Oakland, but you best believe the character of N\u2019Jobu would\u2019ve heard about them. Leaving your black utopian society to learn about the police, the supposed protectors of the country you\u2019re surveilling, beating the shit out of a black man? And getting away with it? N\u2019Jobu was in America during one of the most well-publicized atrocities toward the black community.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImagine living in Wakanda, a world where black folks are treated with love and respect, then being sent out and bearing witness to Rodney-fucking-King. The riots could\u2019ve easily been the tipping point, the moment N\u2019Jobu decided that his people needed to do something. It was certainly better than the alternative: the riots happening after his death, leaving his son\u2014who would ultimately become Killmonger\u2014alone to deal with it. It certainly makes little Erik\u2019s line about everyone dying around them more heartbreaking, especially since he sheds no tears.\n\nAs a man, however, Erik Stevens/Killmonger does cry, because he realizes what he\u2019s become as he sits in the ancestral plane with his father. And even amongst all that violence and death, N\u2019Jobu still had dreams of showing his son life as it could be in Wakanda.

He\u2019d grow up hearing us tell wistful stories of the \u201cMotherland,\u201d while simultaneously dealing with white folks telling us to \u201cgo back to Africa,\u201d as if we chose to be here in the first place.\n\nAnd yet Killmonger would also know that his family in that far-off prosperous land would kill one of their own to keep their land and resources safe; only to later sign the Sokovia Accords to police those with superpowers. So, he decided that he\u2019d create \u201cThe Motherland,\u201d for himself and for us. Villain or not, Killmonger was willing to start from the ground up to let them know who we are.

They want everyone else in America to see us as a threat so that when we are killed with impunity, no one bats an eyelash. This is already happening anyway.\n\nIn a country that was founded on the principles of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, it appears that you can fully reap those benefits only if you are not black, and if you are black and want those benefits, then you need to keep your mouth closed so that you can have the illusion of getting them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new buzz phrase is \u201cblack identity extremists,\u201d and since it has been coined by the FBI, we can accurately assume that this is COINTELPRO 2.0. It will not stop here. They are painting us with a wide brush and making us the enemy because we dare demand equal treatment and justice. They are already finding multiple ways to create punitive damages for black people who speak out against injustice.\n\nThey want to silence black resistance, so they label it something big and scary that serves as a dog whistle to a certain base. They do this while simultaneously normalizing white supremacist and white nationalist ideology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack people wanting justice and equality is considered \u201cextreme,\u201d while a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., complete with torches, Nazi insignia and an innocent woman being killed, is normal.\n\nAs someone said on Twitter, all we have asked is for the repeated killing of unarmed black men and women by police to stop and for justice in those cases where it does happen. This, it seems, has caused white America to lose its collective mind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing unapologetically black, asserting that black lives matter (the \u201ctoo\u201d is silent) and fighting for our basic human rights isn\u2019t extremism; it is the foundation this country was founded on, and these are the principles that the flag they claim is under attack represents.\n\nBut apparently that is only OK when it\u2019s white people exercising those rights.\n\nThe new plantation system is fully engaged. Instead of a whip, they attack our character and our livelihoods. Consider the case of Jemele Hill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nESPN suspended her earlier this week because she said in a tweet that the best way to respond to Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones\u2019 demand that all of the team\u2019s players stand during the national anthem was to go after his advertisers. Nothing gets white people\u2014especially white people in positions of extreme power\u2014angrier than going after their bag, so they went after hers.\n\nThe president of the United States found time in his busy schedule to directly attack her\u2014a black woman and a journalist who operates under the presumption of freedom of speech\u2014on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe is not the first, and she won\u2019t be the last.\n\nThey already iced Colin Kaepernick out and took his bag, making it impossible for him to play in a league he worked so hard to get into, and he didn\u2019t even say a gotdamn thing. He simply knelt during the national anthem and explained to those who asked why he was kneeling. He wanted justice. He wanted black lives to matter.\n\nApparently that is too much to ask.\n\nThey want your Colins and your Jemeles to stop talking so loud with all their uppity learning, getting all the other darkies riled up. There\u2019s no place for that here. Just be glad you are being allowed to earn a living and stay in your place. There\u2019s no need for you to be going around causing all this trouble.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept we aren\u2019t the ones causing the trouble; we are simply seeking an end to it.\n\nThe shaky premise of the entire \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d narrative is that in response to the unending cycle of black lives being cut down by police who are never punished, black people will react with violence against police. This is a false-flag attack. There is data that directly contradicts this narrative. The fact is, the number of police officers killed on the job (pdf) is far lower than the number of civilians killed by police, and when police are killed by citizens, statistics suggest that it is more often by white perpetrators than black.\n\nBlack Lives Matter demonstrations are not violent. There are no torches. No one is being attacked except, usually, the demonstrators themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can\u2019t talk about justice. We can\u2019t march for justice. We can\u2019t kneel for justice and we can\u2019t tweet for justice.\n\nAll of these things are being treated as extreme, when, in fact, they are not.\n\nWhat is extreme is the narrative being crafted to make black people appear as though they are somehow in the wrong for wanting the same rights and treatment as everyone else: freedom of speech, freedom of the press and equal protection under the law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because the internet exists, those presenting this narrative are able to get this propaganda out faster and spread it far and wide in a way they weren\u2019t able to do in the days of Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and the original Black Panther Party.\n\nThe base they are appealing to and using this dog whistle for exists in a media vacuum. As this message gets repeated over and over again by the FBI, the alt-Reich \u201calt-right\u201d media and the president himself, it becomes a call to action for them.\n\nAnd because their ideology is being normalized, no one will be shocked or surprised when they act out in racially motivated attacks against us. Hell, no one is surprised when it happens now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey want us to appear to be the enemy on our own soil because doing so allows their white supremacist system to continue to exist. All of these acts against black people and the Movement for Black Lives are the real extremism.\n\nBut because the voices speaking out against it are largely black, no one is listening.\n\n(Shoutout to Feminista Jones by way of @N7IRL for inspiring this headline with her Twitter display name.)", "keywords": ["rights", "isnt", "lives", "bie", "black", "cant", "basic", "extreme", "felicia", "attack", "human", "justice", "way", "white", "extremism", "narrative", "fighting", "killed"], "polarity": -0.009294426747256933, "subjectivity": 0.4409625228021452},

Gaines\u2019 mother and father were awarded $307,000 and $300,000, respectively, and $300,000 was awarded to the Gaines estate.

Activists cited her shooting as yet another example of police officers using excessive force against black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice officers showed up to Gaines\u2019 apartment at 9 a.m. that fateful day to serve arrest warrants on her and her fiance.\n\nAssistant County Attorney James S.

The prosecutor said that the officer believed he was firing high enough that he would miss Kodi if he was standing next to his mother.\n\nRuckle then placed the blame on Gaines for her son getting shot by saying that she allowed him to stand near her while she was holding a gun.\n\n\u201cWhat parent puts their kid in front of a shotgun?

It was an article that organizers in the Movement for Black Lives say included multiple inaccuracies, and as the group seeks corrections or a retraction, it responded with an op-ed of its own to set the record straight.\n\nIn \u201cWhat Happened to Black Lives Matter?\u201d BuzzFeed reporter Darren Sands said that in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s election in November 2016, while the nation had the biggest outpouring of liberal activism in more than a decade, Black Lives Matter seems less visible than it was a year ago, and the movement is struggling with disputes over direction and leadership.\n\nSands spoke with members of groups that are part of Black Lives Matter and spoke of the history of the movement, the origins of its ideals, the people who are said to have started it and those who are perceived to lead it. There are also hints of infighting, people disillusioned with the movement and where it is headed, and questions about how it will be sustained and continued.\n\nOrganizers within the Movement for Black Lives took issue with that portrayal and wrote their own op-ed on Mic addressing the things said in Sands\u2019 article.\n\n\u201cThese are dangerous times for our people,\u201d they wrote. \u201cHistory tells us that we need responsible, thoughtful and brave journalism. But movements can be stopped in their tracks by uninformed and inaccurate hit pieces that trade in gossip. We must consider what we believe in, who we stand with, and what we are fighting for.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s worth reading both pieces to consider the differing opinions surrounding the movement. Those who spoke on the record with Sands echoed some of his assertions, the same assertions that Movement for Black Lives seeks to clarify.\n\nOne point that Movement for Black Lives makes clear is that just as in previous movements, there is going to be conflict; not everyone is going to agree on every point or every approach, but it\u2019s the way that conflict is handled that will dictate how far the movement can go:\n\nWe are not always in full agreement, we have competing ideas and we will undoubtedly upset each other in the process of making difficult decisions. We are here because we believe that our victories in service of black people are bigger and better when we win together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then:\n\nAnd when we arrive at conflict, we do our best to hold each other to that standard, no matter how difficult or inconvenient. We don\u2019t always get this right, but in order to do so, it requires all of us to hold these values.\n\nRead more at Mic and BuzzFeed.", "keywords": ["lives", "movement", "black", "record", "responds", "matter", "conflict", "sands", "seeks", "happened", "spoke", "wrote"], "polarity": 0.07979407979407979, "subjectivity": 0.5034427284427284},

Every day, nearly 700,000 people are incarcerated despite often not being charged with a crime, simply because they cannot afford to make bail. In addition, there are more black men in prison now than were enslaved in 1850, and many of the black men serving pretrial detention have been accused of minor drug and \u201cpublic order\u201d offenses that disproportionately target black people.\n\n\u201cGetting fathers out of jail for Father\u2019s Day is the emancipation proclamation of freedom,\u201d Pastor Kenneth Glasgow, executive director at the Ordinary People\u2019s Society, said. \u201cWhat we are doing is putting our money where our mouth is.

Although I survived, I was paralyzed and, soon thereafter, charged with aggravated assault and resisting arrest, charges that were thrown out three years later.\n\n\n\nSince that fateful incident, which began as a \u201croutine\u201d traffic stop, I\u2019ve chosen to use my platform as an activist and a motivational speaker to promote greater police accountability, and to call for an end to racist policing practices that continue to keep black and brown communities under siege.\n\n\n\nThis is one of many reasons that I find Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 latest dog-whistling to be so alarming.\n\n\n\nThis week, Sessions spoke before a meeting at the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association, where he praised the office\u2019s \u201cAnglo-American heritage.\u201d His remarks were a thinly veiled reference to law enforcement\u2019s well-documented and persisting link to the Ku Klux Klan and its history of suppressing black Americans and other people of color through physical and systemic violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe deeply problematic context behind his words was best summed up in a tweet sent out later that morning by Bernice King, daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, who vocally opposed Sessions\u2019 judgeship back in 1986.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nPredictably, a Department of Justice spokesperson attempted to convince the public otherwise, saying that Sessions was merely using an antiquated legal term used by lawyers and legal scholars. Perhaps that explanation would have flown if Sessions\u2019 comments were not the latest in a long string of examples demonstrating his use of the attorney general\u2019s office to promote a white supremacist agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Sessions\u2019 mention of Anglo-Americanism as separate from other aspects of American heritage was obviously intended to celebrate only white sheriffs and police officers.\n\n\n\nThe auspicious timing of Sessions\u2019 remarks is also telling. Just last week, Mapping Police Violence and Boston University published new data highlighting the connection between structural racism and racial disparities in fatal police shootings. Key findings from the first-of-its-kind study show that:\n\nOf 1,147 people killed by police in the U.S. in 2017, 25 percent, or 282 people, were black, despite making up only 13 percent of the population.\n\n30 percent of black people killed by police in 2015 were unarmed, compared with 21 percent of white victims.\n\nA strong association was found between the racial disparity in fatal police shootings of unarmed people and structural racism in states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis data drives home the inherent truth behind Sessions\u2019 speech: Black and brown communities are being disproportionately targeted and killed because America\u2019s justice system continues to be governed by people with a vast lineage of racial subjugation and violence. The attorney general\u2019s comments only reinforce the dangerous notion that law enforcement is bound not just by duty but also by racial and ethnic heritage to exert power in any way it sees fit, while using racial profiling, intimidation and abuse as its tried-and-true policing tools.\n\n\n\nThis is the legacy that allows structural inequities to persist, and for cases like mine and countless others across the country to happen. Despite Sessions\u2019 romanticized interpretation of history, racism and white supremacy are firmly baked in our nation\u2019s DNA. To accomplish real, lasting transformation of our deeply flawed criminal-justice system, other lawmakers and the whole of society must meet this hard truth head-on and break all ties with the torchbearers of America\u2019s racist past.\n\n\n\nLeon Ford is a police-violence survivor, activist and author of the forthcoming book Untold.

He was a good student who was very well liked by his teachers, coaches and his fellow students. The entire district\u2014especially the staff and students of Mesquite High School\u2014are mourning this terrible loss.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt should be said here that even if Jordan, an honor roll student, had not been on the honor roll, his life mattered\u2014still matters to his community, to his school and to all those who loved him. Though his achievements and accolades are well-deserved, good grades should not be used by those seeking reasons not to blame him for his own death as proof of his worthiness or to portray him as a \u201cperfect victim.\u201d\n\nHe should not be dead. Period.\n\nEarlier:\n\nAnother day, another black child has been gunned down by a trigger-happy police officer, leaving another community enraged and another family in pain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis time, his name was Jordan Edwards. He was only 15 years old.\n\nAccording to attorney S. Lee Merritt, legal counsel for Jordan\u2019s family, the teen was leaving a party Saturday night with friends after hearing gunshots. He was struck by the officer\u2019s bullet through the passenger-side window of the vehicle in which he was traveling.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Balch Springs (Texas) Police Department released a ridiculous statement in which police claimed that the boys were \u201cbacking down the street toward officers in an aggressive manner.\u201d\n\nMore from the Dallas Morning News:\n\nBalch Springs Police Chief Jonathan Haber said officers heard gunshots as they were responding to a call of drunken teens about 11 p.m. in the 12300 block of Baron Drive. During an altercation, the vehicle backed down the road toward officers \u201cin an aggressive manner,\u201d Haber said. An officer fired at the vehicle and struck a passenger, who was then transported to the hospital and pronounced dead, Balch Springs police said in a prepared statement. Haber said he did not have any information about whether weapons were found in the vehicle. The Dallas County District Attorney\u2019s Office and the Dallas County Sheriff\u2019s Department have taken over the criminal investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Merritt, Jordan and his friends were not the allegedly intoxicated teens whom police officers were allegedly called to control.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t matter to the Balch Springs police officers, who clearly felt perfectly comfortable shooting into a car full of children. The four teens who survived the fatal encounter\u2014including Jordan\u2019s 16-year-old brother, who, according to Merritt, was behind the wheel\u2014were not charged.\n\n\u201cThey were simply leaving a party where they believed danger was,\u201d Merritt told CBS-DFW. \u201cSo I can\u2019t wrap my mind around why an officer decided to shoot into the car.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan was an honor roll freshman at Mesquite High School.

It has nothing to do with my dislike for you or your people. In fact, some of my best friends are white. Well ... one of my best friends is white. OK, I\u2019ll be honest, all of my best friends are black, but one of them is kinda light-skinned, and when I was in the 11th grade, I went to a New Edition concert with three Caucasian classmates, so that should count for something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut my hesitancy in penning this correspondence is based on another fact: I didn\u2019t believe you were real. I didn\u2019t discount your existence the way I don\u2019t believe in unicorns, good cops or Rihanna. (Yeah, I said it. I believe Rih Rih is a highly advanced, computer-generated image based on our collective fantasies. You might think it\u2019s crazy, but I stand by my research.)\n\nWhen people told me that there were actual individuals upset about the upcoming Marvel movie Black Panther, I thought they were exaggerating or overestimating the number. I suspect there are always a few fringe kooks who share an idiotic ideology.\n\nKyrie Irving and B.o.B think the Earth is flat. Some people believe that Donald Trump is both stable and a genius. And once, on the dance floor of a crowded nightclub, a woman told me I was handsome and cute. (At least that\u2019s what I think she said, although she may have said, \u201cYou\u2019re standing on my foot.\u201d It was pretty crowded and I\u2019d consumed a few beverages. But for the sake of this argument, let\u2019s just say it was the cute thing.) My point here is, sometimes people have wildly diverging opinions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust as I was ready to dismiss the notion that there might be more than a handful of people who disliked the notion of a Black Panther movie before they even saw it, someone sent me a transcript of Rush Limbaugh ranting about liberals embracing Black Panther.\n\nI honestly get why Limbaugh was upset. If I were a half-deaf, impotent walrus who had to sit in front of a microphone yelling to white senior citizens who still listen to AM radio while popping Oxycontin like Tic Tacs during commercial breaks, I\u2019d probably be a little jealous of T\u2019Challa, too. Plus, Limbaugh is racist, and the film does have the words \u201cBlack\u201d and \u201cPanther\u201d in it, so .... there\u2019s that.\n\nBut people kept sending me things. There was a story calling Black Panther \u201cobviously racist,\u201d a Breitbart article that called the comic book \u201cBlack Lives Matter-themed,\u201d and that piece where Ben Shapiro crumpled into a rice-paper-thin ball of fuckboy fragility in a nonsensical monologue about how this is the fault of black people, leftists and, of course, Barack Obama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, that\u2019s only three racists people.\n\nAnd then, like a fool, I ventured into the land of white nonsense where coffee machines and Bluetooth speakers somehow have all colluded to form a plot to eradicate the great arrhythmic race: Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s Twitter,\u201d I reasoned. White people on Twitter are like the Incredible Hulk when he\u2019s off his meds: They\u2019ll get mad at anything. Then I happened upon this well-reasoned discourse between writer Zack Linly and a random Facebooker:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can understand why some white people are upset. After all, I distinctly recall how upset black people were about Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, When Harry Met Sally, Twilight, Terminator and The Passion of the Christ (yes, they literally made a movie about Jesus with no black people!).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, the above-mentioned movies were not comic book movies. Making a film about a superhero from an all-black place is an egregious offense. Especially since Marvel put so much detail into making sure its other superhero movies had diverse casts.\n\nI recall how the white outrage forced Hollywood into casting a South American actress to play Wonder Woman, since she was from a fictional race of Amazonian warriors. (I didn\u2019t Google it, but I\u2019m pretty sure Gal Gadot is from Brazil or somewhere. If she were Israeli or something, it would mean white people didn\u2019t care about the ethnicity of comic book characters until a black one came around and triggered their racist ... you know what? I\u2019m not even going there. She\u2019s gotta be from Mexico or Australia, or wypipo would look very stupid right now.) We really thank you for making sure they include black actors every time they flash back to Superman\u2019s home planet of Krypton.\n\nPlus, I\u2019m probably making up the white outcry when someone floated the idea that Donald Glover might be the next Superman, or Idris Elba could play James Bond. I probably imagined that wypipo were upset about John Boyega playing a Stormtrooper, just like I dreamed about Rihanna or that woman who thought I was handsome. (I\u2019m pretty sure she said \u201chandsome and cute,\u201d not \u201cstanding on my foot.\u201d I mean ... I was actually standing on her foot, but that\u2019s neither here nor there.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause white people have repeatedly stood up for inclusion and diversity in casting, we would like to admit that this is our fault. Forgive us for being excited that there is finally a movie that caters to our sensibilities without kowtowing to the notion of a white savior.\n\nI tell you what we\u2019ll do. To make this up to you, we promise that we will remain marginalized, mostly ancillary characters in most of the Hollywood blockbusters for the rest of the year. We also swear that we will allow you to win and be nominated for the bulk of Oscars, Golden Globes, Emmys, Tony Awards, Peabody Awards, Billboard Awards, MTV Awards, America\u2019s Got Talent, spelling bees, luge races, school shootings, mass murders, police-shooting trials, Senate races and rose ceremonies on The Bachelor.\n\nI don\u2019t want there to be any hard feelings.

It is communal, emotive and performative, as black people are wont to be, and much the same the world over. After news of the death spreads, people pour out of their homes to a common area\u2014a park, or to the place where the blood has dried.\n\n\n\nThey weep. Tell stories. Laugh. Smash bottles. Drink bottles. Pour out some liquor and get loud. They light candles, offer teddy bears, photos and prayers. Get louder. It is a catharsis of the first kind, a loosening of our deepest emotions, just to get by.\n\nWhen the police do the killing, there is a palpable anger and tension. There is a visceral heartbreak, especially when the death feels tragically unfair. When police kill a young person, a kid you see every day, there are never answers; there is no reprieve. The hand-wringing sorrow stays trapped in alleys and bodies.

He was killed by a member of the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\n\n\nAnthony was reportedly outside with his neighbors celebrating the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 win when, police say, he matched the description of a man wielding a gun in the neighborhood. Although details are sketchy, the LASD says that deputies confronted Anthony, saw a weapon, gave chase and shot him after he turned toward them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it now stands, no one knows if A.J. was shot in the back; no one knows how many bullets penetrated his young body. No one even knows the names of the officers involved (The Root has reached out repeatedly to the LASD since last week, to no avail). The Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department, notoriously secretive about any investigation involving an \u201cofficer-involved shooting,\u201d has not released much information, and the information it did release raises more questions than answers.\n\n\n\nThe day after Anthony was shot, the LASD convened a press conference that barred activists and members of the community; there, the police played an \u201cedited\u201d version of the 911 call that described a \u201ccall for service\u201d that described a black man in a black shirt and blue jeans, with a black handgun, about 20 years old. Police contend that this was Anthony Weber.\n\n\n\nDuring the press conference, though authorities couldn\u2019t release Anthony\u2019s name because he was a juvenile, Sheriff\u2019s Capt. Chris Bergner was sure to note that A.J. was \u201ca local gang member in the area,\u201d something his father vehemently denies. The captain went on to say that after A.J. was shot, 30 to 40 people from the neighborhood overwhelmed police and took the alleged weapon, and he referred to the area as a \u201chigh violent-crime area,\u201d what the Los Angeles Times called \u201cdeath alley.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCommunity activist and Black Lives Matter Los Angeles member Melina Abdullah calls the police version of the scenario \u201chighly unlikely,\u201d and said that one of her biggest concerns is how this extrajudicial killing affects not only Anthony\u2019s family but also an entire neighborhood.\n\n\u201cWe have to remind people that we\u2019re not subjects, we\u2019re people. We\u2019re entitled to our humanity.\u201d \u2014Melina Abdullah, BLMLA\n\n\u201cFirst they assassinate the body, and then they assassinate the character,\u201d said Abdullah. \u201cAnd so [LASD] is alleging that [Anthony\u2019s] a gang member, that he had a gun. But they\u2019re not listing the fact that this is a 16-year-old child, who the entire community saw all day long, walking around the neighborhood with no shirt on.\u201d\n\n\n\nAbdullah says that she got on the scene about an hour after Anthony was killed, and was disgusted at how the police continued to reinforce pain on an already distraught community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo when we got there, they had at least two city blocks completely cordoned off. There had to be at least 30 officers standing at the line, with billy clubs out,\u201d she recounted, saying that she stood outside the cordoned-off area with a pair of sisters, 12 and 13 years old, who kept saying that they wanted to get home to their mother.\n\n\u201cThis is also community trauma,\u201d said Abdullah. \u201cWe were out there with those little girls until 3 a.m.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Westmont community report that one of A.J.\u2019s brothers (he comes from a family of 10 siblings) was arrested for having a breakdown on the scene. Other witnesses say that A.J.\u2019s father was just aimlessly wandering the street, \u201cout of his head\u201d and talking with people just following behind him at a distance because they didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrisha Michael, a Black Lives Matter Los Angeles member who has lived in the neighborhood for three years, said that her entire family has been floored by Anthony\u2019s death. Michael said that she has tried to be there for the family because she can sympathize. Her sister was killed by Inglewood, Calif., police two years ago. She helps her mother raise her sister\u2019s sons.\n\n\u201cA.J. ... used to be in front of my house, and my daughter knows him very well. She told me he used to pull up and say, \u2018Be careful in the neighborhood, It\u2019s a lot going on,\u2019 or \u2018Be in the house at such and such time because it\u2019s getting dark early,\u2019\u201d said Michael. \u201cI\u2019m sad, my kids are sad, my nephews knew who he was. I mean, we all live on the same block.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael continued, clear that she wants to focus on A.J.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not about me; it\u2019s about a 16-year-old kid,\u201d she said emphatically. \u201cIt just brings me back to my situation, you know? It takes me all the way back to these kids, and how these kids are feeling about A.J. getting killed at such a young age. And the amount of times he got shot; their mama got shot 13 times. They just were hurt.\u201d\n\nDr. Imani J. Walker, a psychiatrist and mental health advocate, says that the grieving process for a community inundated by violence, especially at the hands of police, is ongoing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen a community such as this one is so justifiably upset by the death of a child at the hands of police, the grieving process often doesn\u2019t get time to be fully completed,\u201d Walker explained. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a large group of people going through each stage [of grief] at their own pace. [What] this effectively creates are people who may be at this stage of anger while someone else may be at the stage of depression. So in effect, there are members of the community at various stages who are all pulling each other back into earlier stages of grief. All of these confused emotions generally lead towards feelings of anger and mistrust of their surroundings.\u201d\n\nShe adds, \u201cShared trauma within an affected community can linger for several years, especially if resources are not in place to immediately help manage the feelings generated by the traumatic event. This can cause an affected community to experience not only symptoms of PTSD but depression and anxiety for years to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe community is taking it hard right now. The community don\u2019t know where to go, how to go,\u201d said Michael. \u201cThis community is so used to police invading, instead of [...] working with us, or talking to us instead of targeting young black men in so-called dangerous neighborhoods.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes, I do feel like A.J. was profiled,\u201d Michael continued. \u201cEverybody is not a fucking suspect. You better know who and what. Because my daughter is standing there, she\u2019s 5 feet away from a suspect. What the fuck you gonna do, shoot her, too, because she\u2019s next to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cOur neighborhoods sometimes become like reservations,\u201d conceded Abdullah. \u201cLike, they put us on these little, impoverished tracts of land and try to impose rules that are not laws and treat us like colonial subjects.

On this day in 1886, men and women, many of them recent immigrants, organized a nationwide workers strike that led to the creation of the eight-hour workday and other basic protections for workers.\n\n\n\nThis May Day, that struggle continues as the Movement for Black Lives, wage activists and those who believe in freedom (\u201cthe Majority\u201d) join forces in support of racial, gender, immigrant, disability, queer, economic and environmental justice. This resistance goes Beyond the Moment, beyond moments of outrage, beyond narrow concepts of sanctuary and beyond barriers between communities that have much at stake and so much in common. We will strike, rally and resist. We will amplify the voices of the unheard, recognize the labor of those who are silenced and marginalized, and lift up those people in this country for whom protection has never been guaranteed.\n\nMalcolm X once said that \u201cthe most disrespected person in America is the black woman.\u201d These words, unfortunately, are still true today decades after his death. Today and every day, we center and celebrate women and femmes of the past as we stand up for the future of our communities.\n\nThe contributions and labor of black women are erased in our stories of social change, in media, in our homes and workplaces, and in our movements. We cannot value what we cannot see. The erasure of black women\u2019s work\u2014by men and white women\u2014and the rendering of that work as invisible contribute to its ongoing devaluation.\n\n\n\nDomestic work is an example of how black women\u2019s work has been devalued. Domestic work is rooted in the legacy of slavery, and today, this industry is largely made up of women of color and immigrant women. Domestic work is paid and unpaid labor that occurs inside the home, and it is the work that makes all other work possible. And yet domestic work, because it is done by black women, women of color and immigrant women, is not valued as work. It is seen as simply \u201cwhat women are supposed to do.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve heard that women make 77 cents to every dollar that men make, and yet few address the racial disparities in the wage gaps between women and men (pdf), as well as between women of color and white women, and between transgender and cisgender women.\n\nHistorically, Martin Luther King Jr. is often credited with leading the civil rights movement, when we know that black women like Rosa Parks, Diane Nash, Fannie Lou Hamer and Ella Baker were its backbone. This legacy, unfortunately, continues today as the work and contributions of the women of color who organized the Women\u2019s March on Washington were dismissed in favor of narratives that credited only white women for the largest mobilization in this nation\u2019s history.\n\n\n\nAs we celebrate May Day, we also observe that this day is no exception.\n\nDuring the 1886 Haymarket Uprising, a clash between thousands of workers striking for an eight-hour workday and Chicago police, Lucy Gonzales Parsons, a black, Mexican and indigenous woman, was allegedly described by a Chicago official as \u201cmore dangerous than a thousand rioters.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLucy Gonzales Parsons, firmly positioned at the center of the uprising, was one of the most dedicated and radical labor organizers this country has ever seen. She organized that famous Haymarket strike and should be considered an integral part of what we observe today as International Workers\u2019 Day\u2014but we rarely hear her name spoken in relation to the history of the labor movement in the United States. Her labor\u2014alongside the labor of millions of black women, women of color and immigrant women\u2014remains unseen and uncelebrated.\n\nUnseen and unpaid labor built and maintains the American economy\u2014an economy not only rooted in but also reliant on militaristic, anti-black, anti-worker and anti-women principles. The American economy functions because it pools the wealth of the people in the hands of the few, strategically disenfranchises black communities, and perpetuates the falsehood of a separate and inferior sphere of women\u2019s work. Its function is enforced and maintained by a hypermilitarized police force whose primary directive is to keep those in power and those with wealth safe. But, as Lucy Gonzales Parsons declared in 1890, \u201cWhen the prison, stake or scaffold can no longer silence the voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a step, but not until then.\u201d\n\n\n\nWe are no longer the protesting minority: we are the Majority. But we will achieve no progress on any of the issues we care about and organize around if our speech is repressed by law enforcement, our bodies are imprisoned behind bars and our voices are silenced while our work is erased. We will achieve no progress if the people who power our economy, who care for our children and elderly loved ones, continue to be erased.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve seen firsthand that the people who believe in freedom, justice and humanity greatly outnumber those whose values are rooted in white supremacy, division and hatred. Each time we come together, we build a movement that is strong and diverse enough to protect one another.\n\nThis May Day, we are uniquely positioned to uplift and unify the voices of black and brown people, immigrant communities, the economically unstable, women, children, the disabled, the LGBTQ community, those working to protect our right to work, and those fighting for our right to clean air and water. Our collaboration is rooted in the shared principle that none of us will survive without all of us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt will last #BeyondTheMoment.\n\n\n\nThe Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff.\n\nAlicia Garza is a co-founder of the Black Lives Matter network, and the special-projects director at the National Domestic Workers Alliance.

It has nothing to do with my dislike for you or your people. In fact, some of my best friends are white. Well ... one of my best friends is white. OK, I\u2019ll be honest, all of my best friends are black, but one of them is kinda light-skinned, and when I was in the 11th grade, I went to a New Edition concert with three Caucasian classmates, so that should count for something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut my hesitancy in penning this correspondence is based on another fact: I didn\u2019t believe you were real. I didn\u2019t discount your existence the way I don\u2019t believe in unicorns, good cops or Rihanna. (Yeah, I said it. I believe Rih Rih is a highly advanced, computer-generated image based on our collective fantasies. You might think it\u2019s crazy, but I stand by my research.)\n\nWhen people told me that there were actual individuals upset about the upcoming Marvel movie Black Panther, I thought they were exaggerating or overestimating the number. I suspect there are always a few fringe kooks who share an idiotic ideology.\n\nKyrie Irving and B.o.B think the Earth is flat. Some people believe that Donald Trump is both stable and a genius. And once, on the dance floor of a crowded nightclub, a woman told me I was handsome and cute. (At least that\u2019s what I think she said, although she may have said, \u201cYou\u2019re standing on my foot.\u201d It was pretty crowded and I\u2019d consumed a few beverages. But for the sake of this argument, let\u2019s just say it was the cute thing.) My point here is, sometimes people have wildly diverging opinions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust as I was ready to dismiss the notion that there might be more than a handful of people who disliked the notion of a Black Panther movie before they even saw it, someone sent me a transcript of Rush Limbaugh ranting about liberals embracing Black Panther.\n\nI honestly get why Limbaugh was upset. If I were a half-deaf, impotent walrus who had to sit in front of a microphone yelling to white senior citizens who still listen to AM radio while popping Oxycontin like Tic Tacs during commercial breaks, I\u2019d probably be a little jealous of T\u2019Challa, too. Plus, Limbaugh is racist, and the film does have the words \u201cBlack\u201d and \u201cPanther\u201d in it, so .... there\u2019s that.\n\nBut people kept sending me things. There was a story calling Black Panther \u201cobviously racist,\u201d a Breitbart article that called the comic book \u201cBlack Lives Matter-themed,\u201d and that piece where Ben Shapiro crumpled into a rice-paper-thin ball of fuckboy fragility in a nonsensical monologue about how this is the fault of black people, leftists and, of course, Barack Obama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, that\u2019s only three racists people.\n\nAnd then, like a fool, I ventured into the land of white nonsense where coffee machines and Bluetooth speakers somehow have all colluded to form a plot to eradicate the great arrhythmic race: Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s Twitter,\u201d I reasoned. White people on Twitter are like the Incredible Hulk when he\u2019s off his meds: They\u2019ll get mad at anything. Then I happened upon this well-reasoned discourse between writer Zack Linly and a random Facebooker:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can understand why some white people are upset. After all, I distinctly recall how upset black people were about Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, When Harry Met Sally, Twilight, Terminator and The Passion of the Christ (yes, they literally made a movie about Jesus with no black people!).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, the above-mentioned movies were not comic book movies. Making a film about a superhero from an all-black place is an egregious offense. Especially since Marvel put so much detail into making sure its other superhero movies had diverse casts.\n\nI recall how the white outrage forced Hollywood into casting a South American actress to play Wonder Woman, since she was from a fictional race of Amazonian warriors. (I didn\u2019t Google it, but I\u2019m pretty sure Gal Gadot is from Brazil or somewhere. If she were Israeli or something, it would mean white people didn\u2019t care about the ethnicity of comic book characters until a black one came around and triggered their racist ... you know what? I\u2019m not even going there. She\u2019s gotta be from Mexico or Australia, or wypipo would look very stupid right now.) We really thank you for making sure they include black actors every time they flash back to Superman\u2019s home planet of Krypton.\n\nPlus, I\u2019m probably making up the white outcry when someone floated the idea that Donald Glover might be the next Superman, or Idris Elba could play James Bond. I probably imagined that wypipo were upset about John Boyega playing a Stormtrooper, just like I dreamed about Rihanna or that woman who thought I was handsome. (I\u2019m pretty sure she said \u201chandsome and cute,\u201d not \u201cstanding on my foot.\u201d I mean ... I was actually standing on her foot, but that\u2019s neither here nor there.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause white people have repeatedly stood up for inclusion and diversity in casting, we would like to admit that this is our fault. Forgive us for being excited that there is finally a movie that caters to our sensibilities without kowtowing to the notion of a white savior.\n\nI tell you what we\u2019ll do. To make this up to you, we promise that we will remain marginalized, mostly ancillary characters in most of the Hollywood blockbusters for the rest of the year. We also swear that we will allow you to win and be nominated for the bulk of Oscars, Golden Globes, Emmys, Tony Awards, Peabody Awards, Billboard Awards, MTV Awards, America\u2019s Got Talent, spelling bees, luge races, school shootings, mass murders, police-shooting trials, Senate races and rose ceremonies on The Bachelor.\n\nI don\u2019t want there to be any hard feelings. I know that white people have so little to celebrate in America that seeing black people smile, if only for one second, could just be the thing that breaks your brittle little racist hearts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSincerely,\n\nYour handsome and cute black friend", "keywords": ["upset", "sure", "panther", "letter", "black", "im", "movie", "open", "white", "handsome", "racist", "making"], "polarity": 0.12658975328878244, "subjectivity": 0.4967231258493393},

But McKesson\u2019s lawyer asked that the case be thrown out.\n\nFrom The Advocate:\n\nBilly Gibbens, who represents DeRay Mckesson, of Baltimore, argued the suit against Mckesson should be thrown out because it makes only unsupported, speculative allegations. Donna Grodner, one of the officer\u2019s attorneys, acknowledged in court that it is not known who threw a piece of concrete at the officer, causing him to lose teeth and suffer other injuries during the July 9 protest outside Baton Rouge Police Department headquarters at the intersection of Airline Highway and Goodwood Boulevard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs previously reported on The Root, the officer, who is identified only as John Doe in the lawsuit, says that he was struck in the face by a \u201crocklike substance\u201d that was thrown at police during the July 9 protest over the death of Sterling, a black man who was shot and killed by two white police officers July 5.\n\nThe suit, which also names Black Lives Matter as a defendant, doesn\u2019t accuse Mckesson of throwing anything at officers, but says he \u201cincited the violence\u201d on behalf of Black Lives Matter.\n\nThe suit says that Mckesson \u201cwas in charge of the protests and he was seen and heard giving orders throughout the day and night of the protests.

Now I happen to like it. It was well-acted, moving and is probably the second best Marvel movie after Captain America: Winter Soldier, but that\u2019s just me. All black people don\u2019t have to like the Black Panther movie, people like different kinds of movies just like they like different kinds of ice cream. However, what you can\u2019t do is be lactose intolerant, walk into Cold Stone Creamery complain that they didn\u2019t have a non-dairy version of butter cream confetti birthday cake, then write a thousand word think piece on how the ice cream industrial complex is misleading black folks. Yet, like clockwork late night college dorm cypher masquerading as revolutionary Twitter and blackademia are out in force saying Eric Killmonger was right, that the Black Panther movie is anti-revolution and that the white dude got too much screen time. There are plenty of legitimate critiques of Black Panther, but these aren\u2019t it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s get the big one out of the way first. Killmonger wasn\u2019t right. I know that people are having #expressyourunpopularopinion orgasms on Twitter, and I get it, folks are out there hustling for contrarian hot-takes on one of the most successful super hero films of all time to get clicks on their Soundcloud while blocking any disagreement. That\u2019s just social media. Doesn\u2019t mean any of the critiques are right, and most aren\u2019t. Eric Killmonger (who is the best Marvel villain of all time, since Loki really doesn\u2019t count as a villain) defeats T\u2019Challa in ritual combat, takes over as King of Wakanda and Black Panther, and vows to use Wakanda\u2019s advanced weapons to arm oppressed black peoples all over the world. Some people found Killmonger\u2019s aims to be noble and that the Black Panther movie was overt propaganda against revolutionary politics. Or some academics felt the movie demonized black American men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat black revolutionary thought are these folks reading? Killmonger\u2019s desire to free black people from oppression was noble, but his methods were ridiculous and his motives were questionable. Wakandans didn\u2019t resist Killmonger because of his ideas, they didn\u2019t agree with his methods, which were, again, ridiculous. black revolution in America hasn\u2019t failed because we don\u2019t have enough guns, it fails because white folks outnumber us 10 to 1, and that\u2019s in some major metropolitan areas. Weapons for self-defense or chasing the cops and the Klan out of your neighborhood are one thing, but going to war against the United States would mean the extermination of black people no matter how many Vibranium shielded rhinos you shipped to Ferguson. Now if Killmonger had wanted to turn Wakanda into a refuge for oppressed blacks across the globe, or bankrupt the imperialist powers in Europe and America by creating a single African currency based on Vibranium I\u2019m pretty sure T\u2019Challa would have at least been willing to check out a Powerpoint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThing is though, he didn\u2019t have a good plan, no matter how his supporters try to spin it. More importantly Killmonger\u2019s plan wasn\u2019t intentionally bad because Ryan Coogler wanted to discredit revolution, it was bad because there are still a lot of people dumb enough to think that black freedom in America can be achieved through direct combat. Peaceful Black Lives Matter activists get shot on the daily, what do you think would happen to a militarized black uprising?\n\nSpeaking of militancy, the notion that Black Panther is propaganda for incrementalist reform instead of wide scale revolution can only occur to you if you didn\u2019t watch the movie. Wakandans are a never-colonized, ethnocentric isolationist theocratic monarchy. In other words, the country is run by a royal family that worships a magical cat, and they don\u2019t care about anybody or anything beyond their borders, regardless of race. Heck, M\u2019Baku points out that no Black Panther had visited Jabari-Land for a thousand years and that was like a 15 minute hover bike trip from Panther Palace. How would it make sense in this movie for this nation to move from isolationists to pan-African revolutionaries in a few hours just because a guy dressed like Lil Fizz from B2K showed up with some fighting skills and a tattoo on his lip? Killmonger wants revolution, but only if he is in charge, W\u2019Kabi wants imperialism and Nakia wants humanitarianism, and T\u2019Challa is figuring out how to move Wakanda forward and how to get his girl back. Which brings us to the white man in the middle, Agent Ross. Some critics feel the need to center him in the movie, it\u2019s snarky and sloppy pop culture commentary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only reason Agent Ross was in Wakanda is because he took a bullet for the girl that the king was sweating. Notice the Wakandas weren\u2019t sharing Kimoyo beads with all those dead South Koreans lying around after Killmonger freed Klaue. After that they called him colonizer, locked him in a room and when he volunteered to help overthrow Killmonger; Shuri, T\u2019Challa and Nakia gave him the collective, \u201cOh, you\u2019re still here?\u201d look. The Wakandans never trusted, embraced or fully accepted Agent Ross; he was caught up in a palace coup and proved to be useful. If you think Black Panther spent too much time or gave too much focus on Ross you probably think Get Out was really about Detective LaToya and the inner workings of the TSA.\n\nHollywood doesn\u2019t make revolutionary movies, and even movies that \u2018look\u2019 revolutionary are really status quo propaganda. In every Planet of the Apes movie, even after years of being experimented on and oppressed, the monkeys that want justice and revenge on humanity are always the bad guys. In the X-Men movies even though Magneto is right every ... single ... time, he\u2019s the bad guy. In Django Unchained despite being a former slave himself Django cares nothing about freeing others, all he wants is to get his wife back. In other words, Hollywood movies only say violent revolution is okay if the oppressors are robots or aliens that we can\u2019t have sex with (notice why they had so much trouble in Battlestar Galactica?)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, none of these critiques apply to Black Panther, the movie isn\u2019t anti-revolution, it\u2019s a about the best way for black people to carry out our obligations to each other, wrapped up in a coup, and a bunch of CGI and fancy costumes. Killmonger\u2019s goal was noble, but his methods were nonsense and a-historical. Let\u2019s save the concern trolling think pieces until the next Tyler Perry movie, they\u2019re much more worthy candidates for this kind of scorn.", "keywords": ["black", "panther", "wrong", "yall", "movie", "revolutionary", "didnt", "killmonger", "revolution", "know", "movies", "wants", "think"], "polarity": 0.027858126721763094, "subjectivity": 0.4477436704709431},

In the past four years, the third-generation hairstylist has been making her mark on Marvel films, leading the hair departments of the last two Captain America films, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and, now, Black Panther.\n\nOf course, the Black Panther is a unique superhero, and Black Panther is already proving to be an exceptionally unique film, as Friend tells The Glow Up:\n\nI think Black Panther is\u2014I call it a stand-alone Marvel movie, even though Marvel still has a formula. But I feel like it\u2019s a stand-alone movie, especially for me, because I\u2019m a black woman, and [to do] the first black superhero, that was really an honor, in the sense [that] we\u2019re presenting all of this to the world. We had an important job to do, and I looked at it in a whole different way, because it represents my people. So I felt like, the weight of the world on me at some points, but in the greatest way\u2014that I had the opportunity to present us in the best possible light and put something on camera that\u2019s never been [seen]. So it\u2019s a great responsibility and it\u2019s a great challenge, but it\u2019s my greatest joy in doing it, also.\n\nRepresenting her people was paramount in Friend\u2019s mind as she approached the task of helping to bring Black Panther to life. To begin, she divided the film into three elements: traditional Africa, contemporary Africa and the futuristic Africa represented by the technologically advanced civilization that is Wakanda. In her research, she drew inspiration from everything from traditional African tribes like the Maasai and Zulu to the groundbreaking fashion statements we\u2019ve seen at Afropunk celebrations around the globe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really taking and looking at traditional styles, traditional tribal looks, and seeing what we can make into a modern style,\u201d Friend says. \u201cI like to take, like, a period hairstyle and put it in a modern movie and just put a twist on it. For me, it\u2019s still about classic hairdressing and beautiful lines and silhouettes. That\u2019s how I design hair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriend has certainly had her share of experience with period styles, having also headed the hair departments of Miles Ahead, The Help, Django Unchained, Rock of Ages and Dreamgirls. But whether it\u2019s long and flowing or elaborately braided and twisted, one thing you won\u2019t see in Black Panther is any straightened hair. For Friend, natural hair textures were a major part of her contribution to the visual narrative.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a beautiful time where people are wearing their natural hair,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, there [are] women everywhere who are like, \u2018Throw the pressing comb away, throw the relaxer away. I\u2019m going to wear my natural hair.\u2019 So that whole movement of the empowerment of the hair is there,\u201d Friend explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a diverse universe of naturally styled characters involved a team highly skilled in styling, caring for and mimicking natural hairstyles, as in the case of Angela Bassett\u2019s glorious custom-made wig of 24-inch silvery locs, inspired in equal parts by writer Toni Morrison and director Ryan Coogler\u2019s mother, Joselyn.\n\nBut while Friend isn\u2019t playing favorites on the styles she created, she\u2019s already seeing the influence this film is having on our beauty and fashion choices. She\u2019s received countless raves on the twisted crop Lupita Nyong\u2019o rocks as Dora Milaje operative Nakia and graciously provided The Glow Up with the how-to (hint: The key is keeping it close to the scalp):\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018Wakanda knot\u2019\u2014because it is different than a Bantu knot,\u201d she tells us. \u201c[Because] basically, the hair is rolled down, kind of like a cinnamon roll. And then, once the hair is dried, then, we lifted it from there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEducating other hairstylists is a huge part of Friend\u2019s career, as her greatest hope is to see more hairstylists performing at the top of their game. That\u2019s why she created Hair Scholars, a consortium of award-winning artists led by Friend in educating and preparing aspiring stylists to be the best at their craft and ready to work in the industry.\n\nFriend knows firsthand the value of having a talented team by her side. She credits her Black Panther team for being a large part of the inspiration and craftsmanship that we\u2019ll see on-screen next week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt just felt like our brains\u2014the brainpower was just so high, and the energy was so high, just because we got to create,\u201d she says. \u201cOr somebody\u2019s like, \u2018Well, let\u2019s try this.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Let\u2019s try it!\u2019\n\n\u201cSo it was really great to have that think tank, where we could just be in there and be creating, and just really coming up with things on the fly ... just really having the momentum just to create original pieces that are going to stand the test of time on film,\u201d she continues.\n\nAnd of course, we couldn\u2019t end our conversation without asking Friend how it felt to be on the purple carpet for Black Panther\u2019s epic premiere in Los Angeles last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe premiere was like, you know, it was like 2018 Coming to America\u2014like, it was for real. People took it all the way,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think what it is too, is as black people, we have like\u2014especially now\u2014there\u2019s a sense of pride. People are wearing their hair natural. People are [saying] \u2018black excellence.\u2019 People are rising to the occasion, and I think this movie comes at the time where black people, we want to step forward; we want to be recognized.\n\n\u201cThis movie hits all the right notes for having a black superhero,\u201d she explains. \u201cI mean, at the end of the day, we all want to be superheroes, in whatever we do. If we\u2019re a mom, if we\u2019re a secretary, if we\u2019re a hairdresser\u2014whatever we do, we all want to be a superhero.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re an Los Angeles-based hair artist, you can join Camille Friend for a Hair Scholars master class at the \u201cHair and Makeup by ... \u201d Symposium on March 11 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.", "keywords": ["meet", "hero", "hair", "black", "panther", "camille", "friend", "movie", "traditional", "designer", "really", "panthers", "teamsupernatural", "natural", "think", "having"], "polarity": 0.17398076259489295, "subjectivity": 0.5284920634920632},

Ain\u2019t gonna tear up my cars.\u201d\n\nShoupe was not part of the slow-speed chase that spanned two counties, but he arrived on scene shortly after his officers fired the deadly shots, which was when his comments were recorded.\n\n\u201cI love this shit,\u201d he continues. \u201cGod, I tell you what, I thrive on it. If they don\u2019t think I\u2019ll give the damn order to kill that motherfucker, they\u2019re full of shit. Take him out. I\u2019m here on the damn wrong end of the county.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaughter can be heard as the sheriff makes his comments.\n\nThe incident began last April when Smithville, Tenn., police tried to pull Dial over for driving on a suspended license. At the time, he was driving a 1976 pickup with a fully loaded trailer being pulled at the back. The chase started in DeKalb County before crossing over into White County, where White County deputies took over the chase.\n\nDial\u2019s wife, Robyn, says she is still not sure how the situation escalated so quickly, leading to the death of her husband.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he stop?\u201d Robyn Dial said. \u201cHe was scared. I know him enough to know that.\u201d\n\nThe chase never reached high speeds. DeKalb County deputies told the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation that the chase was more like a funeral procession.\n\nWhen asked by an investigator from the bureau how fast the cars were going, DeKalb County Detective Jimmy Martin responded, \u201cWe might have got up to 50 at one point. For the most part, it was 30 to 40 miles per hour.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, DeKalb deputies backed off at the county line and handed off the chase to White County, whose deputies tried to use their patrol cars to get Dial to stop. Reserve Deputy Adam West, who was driving his personal pickup at the time, also got involved in the chase.\n\nAs noted earlier, Shoupe was not part of the chase but gave the ultimately fatal orders.\n\n\u201cPer 59 [the sheriff], use deadly force if necessary. Take the subject out by any means necessary,\u201d a radio dispatcher can be heard telling the deputies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn that order, West took out his gun. According to News Channel 5, minutes later, deputies managed to push Dial\u2019s truck off the road. West got out of his truck and immediately opened fire. Sparta Police Officer Charlie Simms also started shooting.\n\nDial was hit in the head.\n\n\u201cI feel with every part of me that\u2019s exactly what they wanted to do, was kill him,\u201d Robyn Dial told the news station.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe district attorney ruled the shooting justified, but Robyn Dial\u2019s lawsuit is focused on the callous remarks the sheriff made after her husband was killed. She is suing not only the sheriff but also White County, West and Simms.\n\nThe lawsuit charges that Shoupe \u201cpreferred to shoot and kill Mr. Dial rather than risk damaging his patrol cars.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can thrive on taking a human life. That\u2019s not law enforcement,\u201d attorney David Weissman told the news station. \u201cIf that\u2019s the mentality of the highest policymaker in the county, that\u2019s scary.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImmediately after the shooting, Deputy West is clearly upset, but Shoupe can be heard comforting him, telling him that he had done right by following orders.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about this. I made the decision. You don\u2019t have to worry about it. I took that away from y\u2019all. You don\u2019t have to worry about nothing. Everything\u2019s cool. You done exactly right,\u201d the sheriff says.\n\nRobyn Dial still doesn\u2019t believe that her husband had to die.\n\n\u201cThey could have let him go 10 more miles down the road; he probably would have run out of gas. ... I just hope he knows I loved him,\u201d Dial said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not the first time that Shoupe has been subject to a federal lawsuit. Late last year, both Shoupe and White County Judge Sam Benningfield were hit with suits accusing them of carrying out \u201cmodern-day eugenics\u201d after Benningfield signed a standing order permitting inmates to get 30 days\u2019 credit toward jail time if they agreed to a birth control procedure\u2014either a vasectomy or a birth control implant.", "keywords": ["man", "shoot", "west", "deputies", "county", "dont", "told", "shoupe", "officers", "tennessee", "sheriff", "chase", "slowspeed", "shit", "recorded", "ordering", "white", "dial", "unarmed"], "polarity": 0.015366193260930094, "subjectivity": 0.43372876636034524},

While waiting to prepurchase tickets for Black Panther, I developed an unhealthy obsession with Fandango, and my wallet wept when the Funko POP! figures were released. I was excited to go to Wakanda, y\u2019all, and Wakanda did not disappoint.\n\nExcept for one aspect.\n\n\n\nMaybe.\n\n\n\nSee, something was revealed about the movie before its release: a missed opportunity for queer representation. Back in April, news spread of a rough cut in which Okoye (Danai Gurira) and Ayo (Florence Kasumba) did a bit of flirting. Vanity Fair\u2019s Joanna Robinson had this to say:\n\n\n\nIn the rough cut of this Black Panther scene, we see Gurira\u2019s Okoye and Kasumba\u2019s Ayo swaying rhythmically back in formation with the rest of their team. Okoye eyes Ayo flirtatiously for a long time as the camera pans in on them. Eventually, she says, appreciatively and appraisingly, \u2018You look good.\u2019 Ayo responds in kind. Okoye grins and replies, \u2018I know.\u2019\n\nShortly after the story broke, Marvel reached out to say that no, their relationship was not a romantic one (as stated in the update to Robinson\u2019s article). Oh, and it turns out, the scene was cut from the film, hence the \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d commentary on every single article that pops up if you Google the words \u201cBlack Panther queer\u201d right now. Co-screenwriter Joe Robert Cole said this in an interview with Screen Crush:\n\n\n\nI think the short answer is yes. I know that there were quite a few conversations around different things, different directions with different characters, and characters that we may have. We thought, \u2018Well, maybe we\u2019ll work it this way with an arc or work it that way with an arc.\u2019 The scene you\u2019re talking about, I don\u2019t remember. I can\u2019t remember the exact exchange you\u2019re talking about, but I think it was really brief. I\u2019m not sure. I know that it was not \u2013 there wasn\u2019t some major theme through that we were looking to explore with that in terms of the story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI sat there, waiting to feel betrayed, like Santa didn\u2019t deliver the puppy I wanted, no matter how good I\u2019d been. It\u2019s an all-too-familiar feeling as a black, queer woman: the Hollywood game of \u201cQueerness? What\u2019s that?\u201d Some exceptions may apply, like if it\u2019s a niche movie that won\u2019t have an entire toy section dedicated to it or that one side character whose name you don\u2019t remember. And, of course, there\u2019s Netflix or television (and I\u2019ve praised Black Lightning character Anissa Pierce to the heaven\u2019s above). But when it comes to those multimillion-dollar box-office hits? Yeah, no.\n\nSeeing Black Panther, I was fully prepared to be salty. But the salt never hit me. I went out, saw the movie, got home and ... no salt. Just pure black joy.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo then I thought, \u201cWow, Bri, what kind of queer woman are you?\u201d I should\u2019ve been cursing Ryan Coogler out, swift and fast like my mama taught me when someone pisses me off. But after thinking it over, I\u2019m happy the scene didn\u2019t make it into the movie, and that feels blasphemous to admit as someone who is always championing representation\u2014especially for queer folks of color like me.\n\nBefore I explain why, let me preface it by saying two things: 1) I don\u2019t expect every queer person of color to feel this way, and neither should anyone reading this. We\u2019re not some monolith that is always gonna see eye to eye, so don\u2019t be out here using my words to discredit someone\u2019s valid feelings. 2) People who have expressed disappointment with the scene\u2019s removal have still found joy in the movie. It doesn\u2019t make them hypocrites; it just means that they\u2019re capable of criticizing something they love. And that\u2019s how improvement happens.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m gonna level with you, as someone who\u2019s been squinting through heteronormative romance to try and find a whisper of queerness: Okoye and Ayo flirting with each other ain\u2019t enough for me anymore. It\u2019s the bare minimum of queer representation\u2014the table scraps\u2014especially if it\u2019s two women, and especially if those two women are attractive.\n\nLet\u2019s be real: T\u2019Challa and Nakia are getting whole-ass scenes that go beyond, \u201cI looked at you, then you looked at me.\u201d That\u2019s what I want more of in my queer representation, especially considering the source material that people were referencing when discussing Okoye and Ayo: World of Wakanda.\n\nWritten by Roxane Gay and Yona Harvey, this story is about Ayo and another Dora Milaje named Aneka (who doesn\u2019t appear in the movie, but people suspected Okoye had taken her place as a love interest). In the book, Ayo and Aneka are the focal points, and they\u2019re allowed to develop as both characters and lovers with each turn of the page.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can understand the excitement of potentially including this aspect in the movie, but that breeze of commentary between Okoye and Ayo? That ain\u2019t it. A moment like that can get easily swept away as, \u201cYou\u2019re reading too much into this,\u201d or even, \u201cThat\u2019s just how women are.\u201d\n\nAfter all, if Katy Perry taught us anything, it\u2019s that she kissed a girl\u2014and she liked it\u2014but don\u2019t read too much into it. To do this plot justice, there\u2019d need to be multiple interactions between those women, ones that didn\u2019t solely revolve around flirtation.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nI didn\u2019t think that was gonna happen with Black Panther. I would\u2019ve loved to see it, especially with all the time and care put into portraying Africa and black culture. But you know what else came with that clear love letter to Africa? Boycotts and plans to give negative reviews, because we\u2019re clearly trying to take over white superhero-dom.\n\nNow imagine, for a moment, the reaction if we also had queerness within this blackity-black movie. Actually, you don\u2019t have to imagine it; you can read the comments on any article that dares to complain about the scene\u2019s removal. Nothing says encouragement to implement some intersectionality like being told to let folks enjoy the damn movie without making things so \u201cpolitical\u201d\u2014even if there\u2019s already a comic featuring queer Dora Milaje.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo maybe Coogler and his crew are pacing themselves. Actress Florence Kasumba (who plays Ayo) recently spoke to Jamie Broadnax and Abraham Riesman in an Interview for Vulture about it. For the record, Kasumba is here for queer Ayo, but also had this to add:\n\n\n\nThe thing is, if the makers would have wanted everyone to see the scene, it would have been in the movie. The final result that we\u2019ve seen, there were a few scenes that have been cut. Different scenes, also. They didn\u2019t make it into the movie for certain reasons, and at that point, I have to say: What their reason is, I can\u2019t tell you, because nobody told me about whether it\u2019s in or not. But at this point, I personally think people have no idea who T\u2019Challa is, who are the Wakandans, what is Wakanda, where is Wakanda, what is their culture. There are so many important things that had to be told in these two hours. So the focus was on what is so important for T\u2019Challa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI realize that all of this is a frustrating pill to swallow. And real talk: If there\u2019s any group that\u2019s used to being told, \u201cYour representation might be there later,\u201d it\u2019s queer POC. Black Panther made his first appearance back in 1966, and it took 50 years for there to be a comic based primarily on two queer characters ... and it quickly got canceled. So yeah, those disappointed reactions? Completely justified. I might want better representation before I settle on any ol\u2019 thing, but I also know that when you\u2019re starving, table scraps are savored like a full-course meal.\n\nBut if there\u2019s something I want you to take away from this, it\u2019s that we\u2019re actually discussing queer women of color making a big-screen appearance, and we\u2019re being taken seriously. This scene has started something, and if Coogler puts as much effort into artfully portraying queerness as he did blackness, the future movies in the series will be the most intersectional thing in any movie-verse, not just Marvel\u2019s.\n\nI never thought my cynical, eye-rolling, \u201cOf course the queer scene got cut\u201d self would be saying this, but I think the forces behind this movie are capable of giving queer characters the respect they deserve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019re not there yet, but I think we can be in the future.", "keywords": ["emotions", "panther", "dont", "black", "representation", "ayo", "movie", "play", "okoye", "scene", "queer", "women", "think"], "polarity": 0.11899707996406107, "subjectivity": 0.4967954477388439},

The feds?\n\nb. The cops?\n\nc. Our fairer-skinned, \u201cMAGA\u201d compatriots who order dry whole wheat toast?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe answer is d\u2014all of the above.\n\nAnd if all of this sounds like a vast, paranoid conspiracy theory, I point you in the direction of the Boston Police Department.\n\nDocuments obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union reveal that for years, the Boston Police Department has been using a sophisticated social media monitoring program to spy on the social media posts of Black Lives Matter activists, Muslims and even high school students in the area, according to Privacy SOS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the 9/11 attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., major cities across the country began creating special intelligence units dedicated to preventing acts of terrorism. These interdepartmental units are basically local versions of the FBI, employing the same kinds of surveillance techniques. They are ostensibly local spy agencies.\n\n\n\nThe New York City Police Department\u2019s intelligence unit monitored text messages from Black Lives Matter members. Baltimore\u2019s version used high-definition cameras attached to planes flying above the city 24 hours a day to monitor activists after the uprising over Freddie Gray\u2019s death in police custody. But maybe none were as sophisticated as the Boston Regional Intelligence Center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe BPD used a program called Geofeedia that monitored Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms used by any activists with more than a pinch of melanin in their skin. It collected information about political beliefs, social activism, religious activities and regular conversations that had no importance related to criminal activity. It tagged anyone who spoke out against law enforcement.\n\nWhat it did not do is solve a single crime.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s make this clear: Geofeedia and the Boston Police Department were not targeting criminal suspects. They were not trying to solve or prevent crimes. The people they surveilled were not even suspected of any past or future wrongdoing. They were just regular black people. They were just ordinary Muslim citizens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTake a man named Tito Jackson, for instance. In November 2014, Jackson wrote a Facebook post about being thankful. He talked about helping the citizens of his community pass out turkeys in the days prior to Thanksgiving. He told people to be thankful that they weren\u2019t homeless. But Jackson made a grave mistake in his Facebook post. He mentioned the words \u201cFerguson\u201d and \u201cpolice brutality.\u201d He was now under surveillance.\n\nJackson is not a criminal. Most people wouldn\u2019t even consider him radical. But he was black, which made him a target of the Boston police. There is one more thing that is important to know about Jackson and his targeting:\n\nHe was also a Boston city councilman.\n\nIn March 2016, over 1,000 students walked out of Boston public schools to protest budget cuts. Forty-two percent of students in the Boston Public Schools district are Latinx and 35 percent are black. Only 14 percent are white. Of course, Geofeedia was watching them. The software cataloged the students\u2019 social media communication. As intricately detailed as the program seemed to be, it did not differentiate between harmless private conversation and serious threats. Maybe because \u201cthey\u201d didn\u2019t care. Or perhaps stopping violence was never the purpose of the software.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe program also tracked Muslims who used everyday terms in regular communications. Two of the most frequent \u201ctrigger words\u201d that popped up alerts in the system were \u201cummah\u201d\u2014 which roughly translates to \u201ccommunity\u201d in Arabic\u2014and \u201cMuslim Lives Matter\u201d because ... of course. The Islamophobic algorithm resulted in almost every religious service and charitable activity in Boston\u2019s Muslim community being spied on, including events like a Muslims Against Hunger fundraiser.\n\nSupposedly a crime-fighting tool, Geofeedia was used by the BRIC as a virtual, online version of stop and frisk. There is no evidence that the data resulted in a single arrest. (Although, to be fair, a number of teenagers were arrested for recklessly driving their bicycles. Some people suspect it was because the hashtag #BikeLife was a trigger word in the software.) Instead, the software targeted individuals based mainly on their political beliefs and religion.\n\nThe BPD no longer uses Geofeedia\u2014not because it was ineffective or because there is no evidence that it ever helped prevent a single incident of violence, but because Twitter, Facebook and Instagram banned its use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not an isolated occurrence in a single municipality. It is part of the invisible cost of being black or Muslim and speaking above a whisper. Even if you have no nefarious intentions, you will be watched if you are a person of color who uses his or her voice to do ... well ... anything. It is not even about crime prevention, protecting or serving. It is about control. It is about forcing brown mouths to shut the fuck up.\n\nWhether it is giving away food, fighting for education reform or even thanking God, not being white is cause for suspicion in and of itself. The first right guaranteed by the Bill of Rights is freedom of speech, religion and assembly because, without it, none of the others are possible. If the people entrusted with enforcing those laws are the ones who violate them, then who in this country is really free?\n\nAdvertisement\n\na. White people.\n\nb. Wypipo.\n\nc.

The boy ran when faced with the police, so they gave chase. During the chase, the police spotted the boy holding a gun, and when he turned, they shot the teenager. The youngster wasn\u2019t critically injured, and it seemed like an open-and-shut case of a justifiable use of force.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow people are wondering.\n\nThe Baltimore Police Department is currently in court over one of the biggest scandals in the history of American law enforcement. The corruption case is replete with intrigue as police reveal secrets that sound like something out of an urban-fiction novel or a lost season of The Wire. It has revealed how one of America\u2019s largest cities just happened to be filled with crooked cops, but no one seems to be talking about it outside of Baltimore.\n\nAccording to the Baltimore Sun, it started when a 19-year-old woman from New Jersey overdosed in 2011 and authorities began tracing the origin of the drugs. It led them to a Baltimore drug crew and the discovery that a Baltimore police officer was involved. By the time they finished investigating, eight members of the elite Gun Trace Task Force had been charged with crimes ranging from racketeering to robbery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou want robbery? How about the story of the corrupt squad stopping a drug dealer during a traffic stop and robbing him of $6,500, then going to the man\u2019s home without a warrant and taking another $100,000 out of a safe? Sgt. Wayne Jenkins would ask suspected drug dealers, \u201cIf you could put together a crew of guys and rob the biggest drug dealer in town, who would it be?\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in police targeting regular citizens, maybe you should read about how the Maurice Ward had a technique of driving fast at groups of people, slamming on the brakes and chasing whoever ran. Perhaps you hear how Jenkins believed that all young men with backpacks were dope boys. Or people who drove Honda Accords with tinted windows.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the revelation that the supervisor of the unit instructed officers to carry a toy gun just in case they found themselves \u201cin a jam\u201d and needed to plant one. When one of the officers, Marcus Tayor, was arrested, officials couldn\u2019t figure out why he had a toy gun in his glove compartment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese revelations aren\u2019t speculation. Six of the eight indicted officers have agreed to cooperate with federal law enforcement agents and are testifying in open court. An officer who was scheduled to offer evidence against the crooked cops won\u2019t get to do so after he was mysteriously shot in the head with his own weapon the day before he was set to testify.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: After the death of Freddie Gray and the discovery of multiple officers who planted drugs on suspects, the Baltimore Police Department is one of the most corrupt departments in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr maybe Baltimore is indicative of police departments all over the country. Maybe they\u2019re like the one in Cleveland, which hired the cop who killed Tamir Rice after he was fired by another police department. Or like the South Carolina state trooper who said he shot a man because he was moving erratically while reaching for his wallet. Or when a paid police informant planted cocaine in a store owner\u2019s shop.\n\nIt is not just Baltimore cops. It is cops. They will shoot you in the face in front of your infant daughter. They will choke you to sleep for selling cigarettes. They will shoot you in the back for walking away. And they will get away with it so often that we are shocked when they are indicted.\n\nThat\u2019s the real story.", "keywords": ["baltimore", "boy", "drug", "officers", "shot", "kept", "unarmed", "guns", "person", "case", "department", "maybe", "gun", "toy", "cops", "plant"], "polarity": 0.05545454545454546, "subjectivity": 0.4552587412587413},

North Carolina. Florida. My God. This is really happening.\u201d\n\nAs last night\u2019s results rolled in, I was hunkered down in a war room with colleagues. Together we watched our greatest fear, and that of millions of others around the country, be actualized in real time.\n\nMy body stiffened as state by state, vote by vote, our nation transitioned into the hands of a man who galvanized millions by activating the hateful, racist, misogynistic, sexist and xenophobic feelings residing in the hearts of so many Americans. Upon realizing it was over, I sat almost paralyzed in my chair, and surprisingly, the first thing that popped into my mind was, \u201cWe have to get the hell out of here.\u201d\n\nNow, to those who understand the gravity and tremendous danger that comes with a Donald Trump presidency and a Republican-dominated House and Senate, that sentiment would make perfect sense, especially for black and brown people. But in that moment of legitimately contemplating whether I could get my family and loved ones out of the country, I entered into immediate internal conflict with myself.\n\nShortly after that, I posted a comment on social media about getting a passport with the hashtag #WeOutOrNah? While it was admittedly clever, I wrestled with it later. In that moment, I was serious about leaving because how could I stay in a place that would elect someone like Donald Trump? But on the other hand, how could I consider leaving when I\u2019ve dedicated my life to fighting for black and brown people and those living at the margins in this country? \u201cWhat the hell kind of movement-minded, community-focused person would leave their people behind to suffer?\u201d I asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaking a step back, I realized that this was one of those pivotal, existential moments that come with walking in my full, unapologetic blackness. I was forcing myself to acknowledge and reckon with the complexity of my identity, and within that I came face-to-face with fears I\u2019ve refused to deal with. Not because anyone invalidated them, but because I had convinced myself that there was no room for them if I was going to really support my people, some of whom are suffering from institutional oppression in ways I can\u2019t begin to relate to personally.\n\nBut it was those repressed, suppressed fears that led to thoughts of leaving the U.S. The reality of living in a nation run by someone as deplorable and unfit as our president-elect ignited all kinds of thoughts and ideas that connected to and conflicted with my blackness and role in my community.\n\nThe black woman in me who wants to raise children in a safe environment within the next few years chirped up and said, \u201cNo way that\u2019s happening with Trump in office. Roll out.\u201d But my passion for and commitment to creating safe environments for all black and brown children, not just my own, reside with that identity, too. I\u2019ve committed to fighting in the battle to end state-sanctioned criminalization of young people of color, and to dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline. But I\u2019m afraid to stay and have kids who would live in communities filled with stop-and-frisk- and law-and-order-happy police officers who would have even less incentive to see our children as anything other than criminals and threats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoes being terrified of these and other things really put me at odds with who I\u2019ve committed myself to being and, more importantly, who my community needs me to be? Can I be \u201csuper woke,\u201d someone who believes that liberation must be achieved by any means necessary, and still in this moment have thoughts about a Trump-free life in Ghana?\n\nI can. And anyone else who finds him- or herself conflicted in the aftermath of the election can, too. That\u2019s the beautiful and complicated thing about black consciousness and identity. Our experiences as people of African descent in this country are so laden with struggles, triumphs, fears, hopes, nightmares and dreams deferred that there\u2019s room for any and all feelings about our existence. They may not all be right or ideal for your circumstance, and they may not be in alignment with commitments you\u2019ve made, but they\u2019re OK, and they\u2019re yours to process how you see fit.\n\nFor me and others conspiring in this fight for racial justice and equality, leaving at this moment is not the right thing to do. In essence, this is what we\u2019ve been working for; this is the moment our ancestors have prepared us for. But for others, leaving now to explore other opportunities or experiences outside the U.S. might be what\u2019s best for their well-being and that of their family. And that\u2019s fine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I firmly believe that the organizing and building we\u2019ve been doing the past few years, connected with the legacy of our ancestors, will come together now as never before. The love and the shared passion and vision we\u2019ve seen manifest is transformative, and I\u2019m supposed to stick around and help where I\u2019m needed. So in the end, I answered my own question: Nah, I\u2019m not going anywhere.\n\nChelsea Fuller is a strategic communicator working in Washington, D.C.

Luckily, our editor-in-chief, Danielle Belton, was able to score tickets so that we could be there to give you our impressions of the film. (Although we\u2019re not too spoilery, if you\u2019re afraid to know too much, it might be better to see the movie first.)\n\n\n\nDanielle Belton, Editor-in-Chief\n\nFor most of Black Panther, I couldn\u2019t believe what I was watching. An African nation that was never colonized? Two black women talking to each other about their mission and not, I dunno, either not talking at all or talking about a man? Moments that went on forever where no white characters spoke, or where they were summarily chastised for speaking? Black women who were fully realized characters with agency and their own beliefs? Black men who were completely confident and actualized in their ideals, even if the viewpoints were opposing and varied? A cinematic parallel for the real-world tensions and conflicts that often exist between Africans and African Americans? Black people who were the victors and not victims? What!\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat did I just watch?\u201d was all I could think after I saw it, but in a good way\u2014but also in a sad way, in that I\u2019m 40 and a lifelong movie lover who\u2019s seen almost every clich\u00e9 in cinema; but Black Panther took clich\u00e9 and chucked it off a waterfall, making me wonder why Hollywood is so lazy and often afraid of new ideas that it took this long to see a black film like this, on this scale.\n\nBut ultimately, I want to see more. I want there to be a sequel (I\u2019d love to see where things go in Wakanda after the actions of this film), but I also want there to be more blockbuster movies that take risks and tell new stories. Lastly, I want people to respect assigned seating in theaters. One dude in our theater almost ruined the entire movie because he did not want to find his ... probably crappy ... seat. But nobody has time for this game of seat leap frog. Not today.\n\n\n\nGenetta M. Adams, Managing Editor\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been this hyped for a movie. And in this age when the most eager fans can line up the night before the official opening to see a movie, I\u2019ve rarely felt the urge to be among the first paying customers to see a film\u2014until now.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the splendor and beauty of Wakanda washed over me, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what Africa would\u2019ve looked like if it had never been invaded by colonizers. What if the continent\u2019s vast riches were never stolen and the plunder of black bodies never happened? Black Panther offers the best version of that possibility.\n\n\n\nThe eye-popping fashion was even more amazing on the big screen (and if costume designer Ruth E. Carter isn\u2019t nominated for ALL the awards, I\u2019m boycotting award shows forever). And the storyline (again, the screenplay and director Ryan Coogler better be up for ALL the awards) is so timely and relevant that I actually felt empathy for the \u201cvillain\u201d Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan).\n\n\n\nAnd though the movie is called Black Panther, it is the black women of Wakanda\u2014from the fiercest warriors of the Dora Milaje to Shuri (Letitia Wright), the brilliant scientist who develops Wakanda\u2019s tech (and delivers the funniest lines in the movie), and the calm, regal beauty of Queen Mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett)\u2014who give the movie its heart. I wish my 12-year-old self could have seen such badass black women so prominently featured in a big-budget action movie. And I know that 12-year-old black girls who see the movie today will feel inspired and empowered by these black women, and encouraged to pursue their dreams, no matter what.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLook for me in the line as I hit the theater a few more times to bask in the glorious world of Wakanda.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nAngela Helm, Contributing Editor\n\nI was hopeful but a little bit afraid of the hype surrounding Black Panther (see Empire three years ago). I shouldn\u2019t have been. It was every single thing. Big-budget action. Drama. Comic relief. And an all-encompassing, well-lit blackness that flew off the screen and overwhelmed my senses.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere will be much said about Killmonger, a complicated character who had one of the most powerful lines of the film (I gasped when he said it, and then threw a hand in the air), but what I loved most about him was that although he graduated from the Naval Academy at 19 and went to MIT, he was still so Oakland with his gold teeth and unrepentant brilliance.\n\n\n\nThe white gaze was nonexistent. This was for us, by us and quite possibly a game changer for cinema. I cannot wait for my unborn grandchildren to see it. Wakanda forever.\n\nCorey Townsend, Weekend Social Editor\n\nOne word: FASHION! The looks that were served in Black Panther sent me into a state of euphoria. The bold patterns served as a reminder that color was indeed invented for those with melanin.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe movie also served as a reminder that the world would be lost without black women!\n\nTerrell Jermaine Starr, Senior Reporter\n\nAs soon as I stepped out of the movie theater, I was no longer in Wakanda. And that made me sad. I was forced to share an UberPool with two colonizers. I wanted to yell \u201cColonizers!\u201d and ask them for their tourist visas, but I could not. We weren\u2019t in Wakanda. Nor am I Shuri. I am joking, but I\u2019m really not.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more than two hours, I was surrounded by blackness, consumed with a power of self and possibility I\u2019d never experienced during a film. For two hours, whiteness was not centered. I was. It was challenging to wrestle with that reality and the possibilities of such a world because I was born into a reality where whiteness is the default. My struggles, my successes, my dreams are all predicated on fending off and negotiating with whiteness. In Wakanda, whiteness negotiates with me and has few options but to comply.\n\nThat is a wonderful feeling. I have never watched a Marvel film\u2014nor am I a comics fan\u2014but that has changed. Black Panther left me with a buoyancy about what our current world strives to make impossible: a world centered in blackness, our existence. There are no bells and whistles to Wakanda. It just was. For two hours, so was I. I just was.\n\nNow I am in America, where just being is a struggle. I long for Wakanda.\n\nDanielle Young, Producer\n\nThis is my second time seeing Black Panther, and it won\u2019t be my last. My emotions are not done with this movie. It not only lives up to the epic hype but also pens the only love letter to Diasporic blackness that you\u2019ll ever need. When I got a chance to watch the movie the first time, I wrote a spoiler-free review that allowed me to dig into the black pride this movie undeniably gifts you. Watching T\u2019Challa\u2019s (Chadwick Boseman) baby sister, Shuri, bounce around her lab, brilliantly leading Wakanda\u2019s tech, made me feel like a little girl watching her new role model. Representation matters, and there\u2019s nothing quite like showing little black girls and boys that tech is a possibility for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are just so many good parts, pieces, moments, visuals, everything, but Killmonger is another standout. Obviously, Michael B. Jordan is ribbed for our pleasure, but his portrayal of a villain is delicious. His character is so well-rounded, so wounded and almost right in his attempt to dethrone King T\u2019Challa. And having his character represent black America in the sense of longing to reach home, the Motherland, was so uncomfortably beautiful. The only thing I have left to say about Black Panther is thank you for ...\u201dcolonizer.\u201d\n\nP.J. Rickards, Video Producer\n\nI\u2019ve been taking my 12-year-old son to see superhero movies for years now. It\u2019s definitely his thing: the opening, big action scenes, the one-liners, the larger-than-life graphics and the excitement after. It hit me while watching Black Panther: We\u2019re going to share that with a movie about a black superhero, strong black characters in a remarkable, all-black world. I already felt that way after seeing the trailer, but it was a whole other thing when I got to finally experience the full movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll I could think about was how he would react at certain parts and the discussions it could open up. And to see it with black people proud and dressed up. It reminded me a bit of the level of pride when Malcolm X came out and everyone was wearing X hats and dashikis. You could tell it was made with love by people of color for our people. It also made me hopeful that this will continue to be a regular occurrence, and even though it\u2019s a big deal for the grown-ups, the impact on young people growing up might be greater than we think.\n\nJason Johnson, Politics Editor\n\nI still don\u2019t know what the heck I saw, and I\u2019ve seen the movie three times. All I know is that I was fighting back thug tears every time Killmonger spoke, and this might\u2019ve been the first time in my life that I sat in a mostly black theater and people only made noise at the appropriate times. The other thing I know is this: it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s week and Black History Month, so if you bought us Black Panther tickets this weekend, we go together \u2026.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAshley Velez, Digital Video Producer\n\nBlack Panther made me feel so many things. I\u2019ve shouted \u201cWakanda forever!\u201d too many times to count since last night. Not only was Black Panther visually stunning\u2014from the cinematography to the lighting and costume design\u2014but the writing was also incredibly executed and engaging. It created space for film watchers to have meaningful dialogue surrounding things like generational trauma, conflicting methods of liberation, and identity throughout the Diaspora. Nothing about how these themes was presented felt forced, which is where modern films and television tend to drop the ball.\n\nI really appreciated the fact that Black Panther didn\u2019t feel like it solely revolved around T\u2019Challa\u2019s mental and physical conflicts. The bulk of the characters were elevated in sincere ways. Because of this, I was able to connect with multiple characters throughout the film. I still can\u2019t decide if I want to be Okoye (Danai Gurira), Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) or Shuri! That alone speaks to the significance of how black women were portrayed throughout the film.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh yeah, listen to the soundtrack again after watching the movie! I appreciated it so much more!\n\n\n\nA final note: If you\u2019re a colonizer, I feel bad for you, son.\n\nPsych. No, I don\u2019t.\n\nAnne Branigin, News Fellow\n\nBefore the film, I kept thinking about how Black Panther came out almost a year after Get Out. Wakanda is in some ways the antithesis of \u201cthe sunken place.\u201d Where the latter expressed a loss of control\u2014being at the mercy of \u201cbenevolent\u201d whiteness\u2014Wakanda represents liberation and self-determination in a powerful way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mother\u2019s country has been colonized twice: first by the Spanish, then by the U.S. Although one of our national heroes killed one of the world\u2019s greatest colonizers, Ferdinand Magellan, the enduring evidence of their actions is in our names, food, features, vocabulary. I love how Black Panther imagines a land written off as a Third World country as being, instead, a superpower\u2014a land free from colonization and subjugation.

Masterfully produced and directed by DuVernay, it is a poignant documentary detailing white America\u2019s continual, desperate and ever-changing attempts to maintain racial and legal domination over black people.\n\nWhat has emerged as common knowledge through the Movement for Black Lives is laid out clearly and plainly in the film: Mass incarceration and modern-day policing are mutations of American slavery that mean to maintain the economic, social, political and legal subjugation of black people to support the (white) American enterprise.\n\nHailed as one of the most important films of the year, 13th evokes the eponymous 13th Amendment, which simultaneously emancipated enslaved Africans and laid the groundwork for their continued confinement and the forced extraction of labor from their bodies through convict leasing, Jim Crow and, more recently, \u201cbroken windows\u201d policing and the war on drugs. The abolition of slavery, \u201cexcept as a punishment for crime,\u201d is an insidious loophole in the 13th Amendment that provides an instructive framework from which audiences can better understand today\u2019s crisis of mass incarceration: The U.S. has less than 5 percent of the world\u2019s population and a quarter of the world\u2019s prisoners.\n\n13th boasts an impressive slate of organizers, historians, advocates, scholars and formerly incarcerated people who tell the origin story and contemporary impact of America\u2019s hypercriminalization of black people, including the power of media to create narratives about blackness that were so terrifying that even black America took up the mantle to cage and confine our kindred in the name of \u201claw and order.\u201d\n\nHowever, the film\u2019s power is tempered by a glaring omission: black women\u2019s stories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring neither slavery nor Jim Crow nor the deceptively named war on drugs have black women been immune from the hypercriminality imposed on black people. In 2000, black women and men were incarcerated at 6 and 7.5 times (pdf) the rates of white women and men, respectively.\n\nA pivotal moment in the timeline presented by 13th is Ronald Reagan\u2019s ascendance to the presidency in 1981, when he launched his war on drugs, which was manufactured to decimate black communities and later became the foundation for Bill Clinton\u2019s 1996 doubly horrible crime bill.\n\nBut by centering the story of the criminalization squarely on black men, 13th invisibilizes the unique conditions that compound and give way to both cis and transgender black women\u2019s experiences in America at the intersections of racial and gender policing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo date, black women are the fastest-growing prison population, and this phenomenon can directly be tied into the disgraceful war on drugs that effectively criminalized people suspected of trafficking and using drugs as well as their partners, children and parents. Lest we not forget, Alberta Spruill, 57, was killed after New York City police officers broke down her door and threw a concussion grenade into her home while searching for guns and drugs that were not there.\n\n13th briefly mentions Sharanda Jones, a black woman serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole for a first-time drug offense, but her story is more common than is alluded to in the film. Black women are often swept into the carceral system either from being targeted by the war on drugs themselves or for little more than their relationship to partners who are being targeted by the state.\n\nSimilarly, when conversations about bail reform and the heartbreaking story of Kalief Browder\u2014a young black man who killed himself after being held for three years at New York City's Rikers Island jail for his inability to make bail\u2014emerged in the film, important insights into how black women are affected by the lack of access to fair bail hearings failed to be brought to light. Imagine being held in incarceration while waiting for trial because you can\u2019t make bail and being pregnant. Currently, 28 states still enforce \u201cshackling laws\u201d that require pregnant women to be \u201cshackled\u201d by the hands, feet, stomach or all three during childbirth\u2014a practice that has led to stillborn births, birth defects and maternal mortality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile 13th remembers Reagan as the chief architect of the war on drugs, many black feminists also remember him as the creator and exploiter of the \u201cwelfare queen,\u201d a mythical black woman who defrauded the government for millions through public assistance. The welfare queen, and the conservative lore that surrounded her, gave way to a massive destabilization of welfare and the criminalization of those on public assistance.\n\nYes, black men are heavily criminalized and brutalized by police aggression, but so are black women.\n\nWe cannot talk about Trayvon Martin and not mention Renisha McBride. We cannot discuss Michael Brown and not say the name of Sandra Bland. Kayla Moore and Alfred Olango are equally important to understanding how black people are affected by state violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is critical that histories of white supremacy in America recognize that as long as there have been black women in America, the anti-blackness of the state has fashioned itself to eviscerate black women just as intentionally as it has black men.\n\nWe are more than a brief aside to black men\u2019s stories. We are, and have always been, under attack from the American carceral state. It\u2019s time to tell our stories, too. #SayOurNames.\n\nSamantha Master is a black-queer-feminist activist, educator and member of the Black Youth Project 100.

It has nothing to do with my dislike for you or your people. In fact, some of my best friends are white. Well ... one of my best friends is white. OK, I\u2019ll be honest, all of my best friends are black, but one of them is kinda light-skinned, and when I was in the 11th grade, I went to a New Edition concert with three Caucasian classmates, so that should count for something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut my hesitancy in penning this correspondence is based on another fact: I didn\u2019t believe you were real. I didn\u2019t discount your existence the way I don\u2019t believe in unicorns, good cops or Rihanna. (Yeah, I said it. I believe Rih Rih is a highly advanced, computer-generated image based on our collective fantasies. You might think it\u2019s crazy, but I stand by my research.)\n\nWhen people told me that there were actual individuals upset about the upcoming Marvel movie Black Panther, I thought they were exaggerating or overestimating the number. I suspect there are always a few fringe kooks who share an idiotic ideology.\n\nKyrie Irving and B.o.B think the Earth is flat. Some people believe that Donald Trump is both stable and a genius. And once, on the dance floor of a crowded nightclub, a woman told me I was handsome and cute. (At least that\u2019s what I think she said, although she may have said, \u201cYou\u2019re standing on my foot.\u201d It was pretty crowded and I\u2019d consumed a few beverages. But for the sake of this argument, let\u2019s just say it was the cute thing.) My point here is, sometimes people have wildly diverging opinions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust as I was ready to dismiss the notion that there might be more than a handful of people who disliked the notion of a Black Panther movie before they even saw it, someone sent me a transcript of Rush Limbaugh ranting about liberals embracing Black Panther.\n\nI honestly get why Limbaugh was upset. If I were a half-deaf, impotent walrus who had to sit in front of a microphone yelling to white senior citizens who still listen to AM radio while popping Oxycontin like Tic Tacs during commercial breaks, I\u2019d probably be a little jealous of T\u2019Challa, too. Plus, Limbaugh is racist, and the film does have the words \u201cBlack\u201d and \u201cPanther\u201d in it, so .... there\u2019s that.\n\nBut people kept sending me things. There was a story calling Black Panther \u201cobviously racist,\u201d a Breitbart article that called the comic book \u201cBlack Lives Matter-themed,\u201d and that piece where Ben Shapiro crumpled into a rice-paper-thin ball of fuckboy fragility in a nonsensical monologue about how this is the fault of black people, leftists and, of course, Barack Obama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, that\u2019s only three racists people.\n\nAnd then, like a fool, I ventured into the land of white nonsense where coffee machines and Bluetooth speakers somehow have all colluded to form a plot to eradicate the great arrhythmic race: Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s Twitter,\u201d I reasoned. White people on Twitter are like the Incredible Hulk when he\u2019s off his meds: They\u2019ll get mad at anything. Then I happened upon this well-reasoned discourse between writer Zack Linly and a random Facebooker:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can understand why some white people are upset. After all, I distinctly recall how upset black people were about Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, When Harry Met Sally, Twilight, Terminator and The Passion of the Christ (yes, they literally made a movie about Jesus with no black people!).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, the above-mentioned movies were not comic book movies. Making a film about a superhero from an all-black place is an egregious offense. Especially since Marvel put so much detail into making sure its other superhero movies had diverse casts.\n\nI recall how the white outrage forced Hollywood into casting a South American actress to play Wonder Woman, since she was from a fictional race of Amazonian warriors. (I didn\u2019t Google it, but I\u2019m pretty sure Gal Gadot is from Brazil or somewhere. If she were Israeli or something, it would mean white people didn\u2019t care about the ethnicity of comic book characters until a black one came around and triggered their racist ... you know what? I\u2019m not even going there. She\u2019s gotta be from Mexico or Australia, or wypipo would look very stupid right now.) We really thank you for making sure they include black actors every time they flash back to Superman\u2019s home planet of Krypton.\n\nPlus, I\u2019m probably making up the white outcry when someone floated the idea that Donald Glover might be the next Superman, or Idris Elba could play James Bond. I probably imagined that wypipo were upset about John Boyega playing a Stormtrooper, just like I dreamed about Rihanna or that woman who thought I was handsome. (I\u2019m pretty sure she said \u201chandsome and cute,\u201d not \u201cstanding on my foot.\u201d I mean ... I was actually standing on her foot, but that\u2019s neither here nor there.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause white people have repeatedly stood up for inclusion and diversity in casting, we would like to admit that this is our fault. Forgive us for being excited that there is finally a movie that caters to our sensibilities without kowtowing to the notion of a white savior.\n\nI tell you what we\u2019ll do. To make this up to you, we promise that we will remain marginalized, mostly ancillary characters in most of the Hollywood blockbusters for the rest of the year. We also swear that we will allow you to win and be nominated for the bulk of Oscars, Golden Globes, Emmys, Tony Awards, Peabody Awards, Billboard Awards, MTV Awards, America\u2019s Got Talent, spelling bees, luge races, school shootings, mass murders, police-shooting trials, Senate races and rose ceremonies on The Bachelor.\n\nI don\u2019t want there to be any hard feelings. I know that white people have so little to celebrate in America that seeing black people smile, if only for one second, could just be the thing that breaks your brittle little racist hearts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSincerely,\n\nYour handsome and cute black friend", "keywords": ["upset", "sure", "panther", "letter", "black", "im", "movie", "open", "white", "handsome", "racist", "making"], "polarity": 0.12658975328878244, "subjectivity": 0.4967231258493393},

That\u2019s when the law-enforcement-adjacent officer decided that he needed to act quickly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs they were walking, the student became noncompliant on two separate occasions and made an attempt to free herself by pulling away from the officer,\u201d said Vasquez. \u201cTo prevent the student from escaping, the officer forced the student to the ground.\u201d\n\nThe officer reflected on the carnage of recent pepper-spray attacks like the Las Vegas Pepper Spray Attack, often called the largest mass peppering in U.S. history, when a woman pepper-sprayed four guys outside Circus Circus trying to hand out flyers for the Bunny Ranch.\n\nIn the La Mesa case, the quick-thinking policeman decided to defuse the issue with an MMA-style body slam of an already handcuffed 17-year-old girl.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe threw her entire body over his shoulder and then pinned her to the ground using his knees.

The statement closes with a solemn commitment and enduring promise to fight anti-blackness everywhere: 'We see you. We hear you. We stand with you.'\"\n\nRead the full #Arabs4BlackPower statement below:\n\n\n\nWe, the undersigned artists, academics, mothers, fathers, students, refugees, and community organizers with ties to Arabic\u00ad-speaking regions, declare our unwavering solidarity with the Movement for Black Lives (M4BL). We fully and wholeheartedly endorse the policy demands put forth by the US\u00ad-based Movement for Black Lives platform and its transnationalist vision for Black power, freedom and justice. We join you in reiterating the necessity of shared struggle and collective liberation of all oppressed and indigenous people globally. For liberation to be real and genuine, we all need to get free. The current iteration of the movement to end the war and genocide against Black people in the US is rooted in centuries of the Black freedom struggle. As we commemorate the month of Black August and its history of radical resistance, we as #Arabs4BlackPower commit to amplifying the rebellions of Black and indigenous people in the settler\u00ad-colonies of the Americas; and to joining in the fight against white supremacy, patriarchy, and hyper\u00ad-militarized late capitalism. Once again, Black people in the US are defending themselves from the violence inscribed in the Americas' settler colonialist regimes built on the backs of Indigenous, Black, and Brown people through the expropriation of indigenous lands, genocide, and slavery. Once again, Black freedom fighters are refusing colonial and imperial narratives that uphold white supremacy and are continuing to craft a language rooted in the struggle for justice. Once again, Black liberation movements are challenging systems of criminalization that dehumanize, incarcerate, and assassinate Indigenous, Black, and Brown people\u2014systems that simultaneously transcend and reinforce national boundaries through border-control complexes to terrorize people around the world under the umbrella of the global \u201cwar on terror.\u201d And once again, Black organizers in the US have put forth a vision to continue imagining and transforming these systems within and across borders. The U.S. empire violently exerts control over Indigenous, Black, and Brown communities internally and around the globe. People in predominantly Arabic\u00ad-speaking regions experience empire in locally specific material forms: bombings, drone strikes, forced disappearances, checkpoints, carceral wars, forced migration, indigenous displacement, starvation, the theft of natural resources, apartheid, and more. The geography of \u2018Ferguson to Palestine\u2019 is integral to #Arabs4BlackPower charting the structural connections, albeit different manifestations, inscribed by the US-\u00adled \u201cwar on terror.\u201d It connects anti\u00ad-Blackness as well as anti\u00ad-Muslim and anti\u00adArab racism in the US with global imperial wars in the rest of the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cwar on terror\u201d rests on regional geopolitical alliances forged for the sole purpose of maintaining and furthering imperial and Zionist hegemony. It is situated within a genealogy of colonial legacies that have structured power in Arabic\u00adspeaking regions along the lines of gender, religion, ethnicity, skin color, language, and sexual orientation, to name a few. With these genealogies in mind, those of us struggling to rid all communities of the Maghreb and the Mashreq* from militarization and neoliberalism must center the lived experiences and aspirations of women, Black Arabs, Nubians, Imazighen, Kurds, Armenians, migrant workers, refugees, gender\u00ad-nonconforming individuals, queers, and others. We pledge to work against marginalization within our communities in all its forms and to continue examining the language we use as we continue dismantling colonial legacies. We must refuse and erase national boundaries created to divide us\u00ad\u00ad\u2014building with the oppressed from Palestine to Western Sahara, from Yemen to Syria, from Algeria to Sudan, from Tunisia to Egypt and beyond, as we come together in solidarity with the Movement for Black Lives. In pledging to resist and overcome, we as #Arabs4BlackPower unequivocally support the M4BL platform for reparations, invest\u00ad-divest, economic justice, community control and political power. We recognize, as did many before us, that only through joint struggle will we dismantle the distinct yet intersecting systems that both oppress Black and Indigenous people in the settler colonies of the Americas and institutionalize a war of terror from within US boundaries to the Mashreq, Maghreb, and beyond. To this end, we commit ourselves to combating anti\u00ad-Blackness wherever we find it in our communities\u2014both within the boundaries of the US as immigrant\u00ad-settlers complicit in white supremacy, as well as in Arabic\u00adspeaking regions where socio\u00ad-historically distinct forms of discrimination against Black Arabs intersect with other forms of marginalization along the lines of gender, religion, ethnicity, skin color, language, and sexual orientation to name a few. From Ferguson to Palestine: we will work for liberation. To everyone building towards the Movement for Black Lives: We see you. We hear you. We stand with you. **Maghreb and Mashreq are locally referenced geographies within predominantly Arabic speaking regions spanning from the Maghreb (Western Africa) to the Mashreq (Eastern Africa and Western Asia).

Carter\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 reads like a list of iconic favorites from contemporary black cinema. In the 30 years since her first film, Spike Lee\u2019s 1988 hit, School Daze, the Oscar- and Emmy-nominated costume designer has amassed more than 60 film and television credits, including I\u2019m Gonna Git You Sucka (1988); Do the Right Thing (1989); Mo\u2019 Better Blues (1990); House Party 2 (1991); Jungle Fever (1991); The Five Heartbeats (1991); Malcolm X (1992); What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It (1993); Crooklyn (1994); Clockers (1995); B*A*P*S (1997); Rosewood (1997); Amistad (1997); Love & Basketball (2000); Shaft (2000); Bamboozled (2000); Black Dynamite (2009); Sparkle (2012); The Butler (2013); Selma (2014) and Marshall (2017), not to mention Being Mary Jane and the recent reboot of Roots (2016).\n\nNow Carter is stunning us once again with her work in the most anticipated film of the year, Black Panther, her 40th film and first superhero narrative (unless you count Malcolm X). The Glow Up was blessed with the opportunity to speak with her during the flurry of publicity for this groundbreaking film while she took a rare timeout in Cape Town, South Africa. It proved a fitting setting to discuss how she helped create the fictional African country of Wakanda, and how it feels to quietly be one of the architects of black cultural collective consciousness. Ever humble, the now legendary designer told us:\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. ... You look at enough research, you know the people. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. And so, collectively, when [I] look at my work, I just feel proud that I had some consistency with my approach to all of them. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from. I was challenged each time to really get it right. ... That\u2019s kind of been my journey. And so when I look back at everything, I feel a sense of accomplishment and pride that Black Panther has kind of brought me full circle. I feel like I traveled from slavery with Roots and Amistad. And I went through the Depression with Rosewood in the \u201920s. I did Selma in the \u201950s. With Malcolm X, it was the \u201920s all the way through the \u201960s, and then I got a little \u201970s here and there with some funny ones like Black Dynamite. And then Black Panther came along, and now I\u2019m circling right back to Africa. So I actually feel like I closed the circle a little bit ... and I think they all helped to connect African history and African-American history. I\u2019m hoping for that.\n\nCarter, who has made history of her own as the first African American to be nominated for an Academy Award in costume design\u2014first for Malcolm X and again for Amistad\u2014ventured into new territory for her first Marvel film. In a stroke of luck, she learned she\u2019d gotten the job while working on Marshall, the Thurgood Marshall biopic starring future T\u2019Challa, Chadwick Boseman, directed by Black Panther comic writer Reginald Hudlin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like, you know how lucky is this? I get to study [Chadwick\u2019s] body; I get to ask Reggie questions about the Black Panther concept,\u201d Carter said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even that recon couldn\u2019t fully prepare Carter for the Marvel experience, working with a team of five illustrators and a huge crew to bring the citizens of Wakanda to life. It was also the first time she had to design with movie merchandise in mind\u2014including action figures\u2014which meant that unlike Carter\u2019s previous work, many of the major costumes, like T\u2019Challa\u2019s iconic suit, were already well-defined. Instead, her role was to bring authenticity to characters that the fans of Black Panther have previously known only as illustrations, as she told The Glow Up: \u201cOnce I got the framework, we did a lot of experimentation. ... It\u2019s kind of like they gave me a coloring book and a big box of crayons.\u201d\n\nThat experimentation involved extensive research by Carter\u2019s team of four, exploring the ancient peoples of Africa\u2014including the Zulu, Maasai, Himba, Xhosa and the Turkana, which inspired the beautiful beading and neckpieces of the Dora Milaje. (Notably, Carter tries to steer clear of the word \u201ctribe\u201d because of its colonialist overtones, preferring to simply call each group of people by its name.)\n\nIn doing so, her team divided Wakanda into districts, according to a \u201cbible\u201d of sorts composed by director Ryan Coogler and production designer Hannah Beachler, that outlined both the story and layout of the fictional country. Said Carter:\n\nIt was an incredible piece of work; it was an incredible notebook that really forged us all so far ahead, because we were all working from the same nucleus ... there\u2019s different [communities] of Wakanda, and that bible that they did really outlined what parts of Wakanda were what. [For example] if you take any city, like New York, and you divide it by, you know, midtown, Brooklyn, the Village, NYU area, uptown, Columbia, Harlem, you kind of have a good sense of how Wakanda is broken up, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to Carter\u2019s core team, she also employed locals in South Africa and Ghana to search out antiques that would inspire the handmade feel she strongly felt Black Panther\u2019s costumes needed to have. Following Coogler\u2019s request that even the armor of the Dora Milaje feel like jewelry, Carter also brought on board friend and jeweler Douriean, who specializes in Afrofuturistic, hand-tooled, hand-hammered pieces, many of which have been worn by cast members during the film\u2019s premieres and press. Douriean is also the creator of Black Panther\u2019s officially licensed line of jewelry.\n\nAnd while Carter doesn\u2019t describe the experience as a seamless one, she credits Marvel for helping her realize the vision; even when some of the challenges of bringing Wakanda to life proved daunting:\n\nI had the greatest support from Marvel. The head executives, they never wavered. I never, ever felt\u2014and you know, every costume designer has at some point on a show felt like, \u201cThey\u2019re going to fire me, I know it. I\u2019m going to be fired tonight.\u201d We all go through that. And even though I may have had those thoughts, they were few and far between because I felt like I was supported 100 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney 1 / 15\n\nCarter is no stranger to making even the improbable possible; in her days as a student at Hampton University, she created a costume-design curriculum for herself after finding that there was nothing available to foster her budding talent. After graduation and a few opera-company internships, her HBCU experience and ingenuity came in handy when a chance meeting with director Spike Lee led to her first film, the now classic School Daze. It was the first of 14 films they\u2019d make together.\n\nBut even if she\u2019d do it all again, would she advise others to follow in her footsteps? She told The Glow Up: \u201cWell, don\u2019t do what I did, because I don\u2019t think it works today. I think that there\u2019s more avenues than I had. So I hope that my career has made some of those avenues available for other people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from.\n\nIf nominated for next year\u2019s Academy Award, Carter could become both the first woman ever to win for a superhero film and the first black woman to win for best costume design. But when asked if she has any reservations or resentments about primarily being hired to costume black films\u2014which make up most, but far from all, of her work\u2014she had this to say:", "keywords": ["consciousness", "black", "panther", "theyre", "marveldisney", "wannabes", "felt", "feel", "ruth", "carter", "cultural", "film", "know", "costumes", "wakanda"], "polarity": 0.2138487889520948, "subjectivity": 0.47147418697005467},

They were also joined by members of the National Black Justice Coalition.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Over the past year, this movement has been working to translate our lived experience and collective needs into concrete policy proposals,\" Bonsu said of BYP100's advocacy efforts. The advocacy activity on Capitol Hill has been in the planning for over a year.\n\n\"Today has been an amazing day. We came here because we know there is no permanent lobby for black people in America,\" Carruthers said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We understand that citizenship for black people in America has always been tenuous and unguaranteed for our folks. We have a strategy that includes protesting and direct action and massive civil disobedience. We believe we can determine what the public policy process looks like,\" she added at a press conference on Capitol Hill.\n\nBYP100's members came to Washington, D.C., from Philadelphia, San Francisco, New Orleans, Chicago and Durham, N.C.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"What we believe in fundamentally is that our government has misplaced priorities. That our government is investing in policing and prisons and punitive measures and filling the pockets of corporations while our communities continue to be divested from and poorly invested in,\" Carruthers also said.\n\nA cornerstone principle of the group is to defund police departments and redirect that funding to communities.\n\n\"We are very clear that police departments and law-enforcement agencies on every level must be defunded and those dollars go to mental-health services for our communities and quality education,\" Carruthers said.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe activists met with the staffs of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Rep. Danny Davis (D-Ill.), and Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Mark Kirk (R-Ill.). They also met with Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) for over an hour in a session broadcast on Facebook Live, as well as with Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.).\n\nThe U.S. is the world's biggest jailer, with 2.3 million people behind bars. Even though the U.S. makes up only 5 percent of the world's population, the U.S. has almost 25 percent of all the world's prisoners. There's a possibility that the House may take up a justice-reform bill that includes a new mandatory penalty for cocaine laced with fentanyl and more funding for police. BYP100's advocates made it clear that they were against the legislation.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA recent study by the George Warren Brown School of Social Work at Washington University in St. Louis revealed that the cost of incarceration in the U.S. is more than $1 trillion.\n\nLauren Victoria Burke is a Washington, D.C.-based political reporter who writes the Crew of 42 blog.

Black Lightning is a (retired) black superhero operating outside the law. Of course he\u2019s had run-ins with the police.\n\nBlack Lightning\u2019s issues with law enforcement don\u2019t stop when he takes off his costume and becomes school principal Jefferson Pierce\u2014something that Black Lightning showrunner and executive proper Salim Akil wanted to make readily apparent in the series\u2019 first episode.

But the picture many saw told only one side of the story.\n\nPolice killed the woman, Korryn Gaines, and her 5-year-old son was wounded in the altercation. She had attempted to share her encounter with police using Instagram. The police urged Facebook, which owns Instagram, to deactivate her accounts. In response, Facebook cut Gaines\u2019 live stream from its feed.\n\n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t an isolated incident. In July, Diamond Reynolds used Facebook Live to record the immediate aftermath of the horrific police shooting of her boyfriend, Philando Castile. Once footage hit 1 million views, Facebook temporarily removed the video. A Facebook spokesperson claimed this was due to a \u201ctechnical glitch,\u201d but many media reports suggest otherwise.\n\nFor many, Facebook has come to represent a public square\u2014a place where we can assemble with others, share information and speak our minds. But it isn\u2019t public. It\u2019s a private platform where everyone\u2019s rights to connect and communicate are subject to Facebook\u2019s often arbitrary terms and conditions.\n\nThe Constitution protects everyone\u2019s right to record police officers in the public discharge of their duties. But this right goes only as far as your smartphone. Once people decide to share the resulting videos\u2014including those that expose shocking police abuses\u2014the potential for state and private forces to censor the footage becomes very real.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFacebook claims to take down or block videos that glorify violence and says that it will grant law-enforcement requests to suspend accounts in cases where there is an \u201cimmediate risk of harm,\u201d but that\u2019s a vague and difficult standard to apply, and one that\u2019s subject to police discretion.\n\nThe Gaines and Reynolds videos remind us that social media companies like Facebook, Google (which owns YouTube) and Twitter ultimately control our ability to share the images that have fueled the Movement for Black Lives.\n\nThe fact that these companies can arbitrarily remove our speech, images and videos has serious consequences for those struggling to expose racial injustice to a wider audience. Earlier this week, more than 40 social justice and digital-rights groups sent Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg a letter (pdf) urging the company to clarify its policy on honoring police requests to censor videos and other content.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe groups, which include the Center for Media Justice, ColorOfChange.org, Daily Kos, Free Press and SumOfUs, also asked Facebook to restore Gaines\u2019 videos from her encounter with police so the public can decide whether the police violated her rights.\n\nIn the second half of 2015, Facebook received 855 requests from government and local authorities, including local police forces, for \u201cemergency\u201d action related to users\u2019 accounts. According to Facebook, these actions included the blocking of user access to accounts as well as the handover of user information. Over that time period, the company complied with nearly 3 out of every 4 such requests.\n\nThis raises several questions: Will police demand that Facebook cover up potential abuses that witnesses have recorded and then shared on the platform, even when there is no real risk of immediate harm? And how will it respond when the risk of harm comes from police violence itself? Shouldn\u2019t our right to record such interactions with law enforcement include our right to share these recordings with others?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFacebook needs clear guidelines and processes that are transparent to users on how it determines whether to block someone\u2019s stream or deactivate an account. It shouldn\u2019t allow police to demand takedown requests to avoid scrutiny or cover up abuse. We need to know when and why Facebook and other social media platforms have granted these requests, with clear standards for the future.\n\n\u201cRisk of harm\u201d is a factor, but one could interpret that standard to justify censoring almost any interaction with law enforcement\u2014and especially those in which an interaction escalates because of a person\u2019s race.\n\nThe fight for racial equity in the media is often a fight against media monopoly, especially when these companies are white-owned and operated. And Facebook is a face of monopoly in the age of social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew gatekeepers like Facebook must make confronting racism a priority. Yes, Zuckerberg has been outspoken in his support for racial justice\u2014even hanging a Black Lives Matter sign outside company headquarters. But we must urge him to ensure that his company\u2019s actions match his words. Providing clarity and accountability on Facebook\u2019s policy for suspending accounts and blocking images of police encounters is a start.\n\nThe Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff.\n\nTimothy Karr is the senior director of strategy for Free Press, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for universal access to an open and affordable internet.

Edwards Memorial Endowed Scholarship Fund was conceptualized \u201cto promote the education of deserving undergraduate students who enroll full time at the University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, Alabama.\u201d\n\nAs The Root previously reported, 15-year-old Jordan, two of his brothers and their friends were leaving a house party on April 29, 2017, when Balch Springs, Texas, Police Officer Roy Oliver pointed his rifle at the car full of teens and opened fire, fatally shooting Jordan in the head.\n\nOliver was eventually fired and indicted on murder charges, but not before Balch Springs Police Chief Jonathan Haber attempted to justify Jordan\u2019s extrajudicial killing. Haber initially claimed that the car in which Jordan was traveling was \u201cbacking down the street toward officers in an aggressive manner,\u201d which prompted Oliver to open fire.\n\nHaber later admitted during a press conference that he lied \u201cmisspoke.\u201d \u201cAfter reviewing the video, I don\u2019t believe that [the fatal shooting] met our core values,\u201d Haber said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan, a freshman honor student and athlete at Mesquite High School, dreamed of attending the University of Alabama and playing football for the Crimson Tide. Oliver ended those dreams with a single bullet, but Jordan\u2019s legacy will not die.\n\n\u201cThe circumstances of his death could have easily made his mark one of tragedy,\u201d the scholarship\u2019s website reads. \u201cWe will not allow that to be how Jordan is remembered. He was an excellent student, an athlete, a brother, and a son. His mark will be one of opportunity, for a student to become what time and events did not allow to Jordan. ... It will be the duty of the scholarship recipients to carry on a legacy of hope in Jordan\u2019s name, hope for a better, diverse tomorrow.\u201d\n\nWhen Brandon P. Bell, who plays the character Troy in Dear White People, heard Jordan\u2019s story, he connected with the teen on a visceral level and knew that he had to do something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHonestly, I was motivated by frustration. I\u2019m from Dallas, so I have that connection, but it\u2019s more than that,\u201d Bell said in an interview with The Root.\n\n\u201cI read about Jordan\u2019s story and was on the verge of tears. I knew that I wanted to do something, and I wanted to do it specifically for the family,\u201d Bell said. \u201cSo I reached out to them to see how they wanted to honor Jordan\u2019s legacy, and they wanted to do that through education. Everything started from there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarque Richardson, who plays Reggie on Dear White People, has been with Bell every step of the way in seeing this scholarship fund come to fruition. He also traveled with Bell to Texas to meet Jordan\u2019s family.\n\n\n\n\u201cUA was Jordan\u2019s dream school, but his life\u2014and the opportunity to realize his dreams\u2014was stolen from him and his family,\u201d Richardson told The Root.\n\nBoth Bell and Richardson said that the scholarship fund was created to give students the opportunity to live out their dreams because Jordan no longer can.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the scholarship specifies that funds will be awarded to \u201cdeserving students,\u201d Bell made it clear that \u201cdeserving\u201d is about much more than grades and extracurricular activities.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe concept of being deserving is so vast,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about how someone looks on paper, not just their GPA. But do they represent who Jordan was as a person? Do they understand\u2014or are they trying to learn\u2014about the systemic oppression that creates the environment where Jordan\u2019s death can take place?\n\n\u201cThe family created an essay question for the scholarship, and it really reflects the heart of what we\u2019re trying to accomplish,\u201d he continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRichardson agreed, adding that supporting students and helping them navigate a racist society is critical.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to help pave the way so that our leaders of tomorrow have the tools they need to create the change we need,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to take it to the streets, but we also have to have people in positions to influence policy and legislation, to change the world on an institutional level. That\u2019s what this scholarship is about.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have to create space for our children to be supported in the fullness of their humanity,\u201d Richardson continued. \u201cWe have to do what we can do to help them reach their goals. They deserve that.

What happened next is still up for debate.\n\nThe LAPD says that the man resisted, fought with the cops and eventually tried to grab an officer\u2019s gun. The man\u2019s family says that he was unarmed and suffering from mental illness and was a victim of police brutality. A bystander\u2019s video showed officers manhandling, punching and choking the Cameroonian man. There is only one thing that every party agrees on:\n\nAn officer of the LAPD shot and killed Charly \u201cAfrica\u201d Keunang.\n\nIt seems like it would be an easy thing to clear up. At least three officers on the scene were outfitted with body cameras that captured the incident. But for three years the city of Los Angeles refused to release the footage, until the Los Angeles Times, after a lengthy court battle, obtained the videos from those bodycams on Tuesday.\n\nThe videos show Keunang standing in front of his tent arguing with policemen as Francisco Martinez, an officer who Skid Row residents called a \u201chard-ass bitch cop,\u201d threatens to shoot Keunang with a Taser. Keunang goes back inside his tent and tells the officers to \u201cleave me alone.\u201d As Keunang exits his tent again, the video shows Martinez tasing him. At least three officers pounce on him. You can hear and see another cop, Daniel Torres, using his Taser directly against Charly\u2019s body as the officers yell, \u201cStop resisting!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMartinez\u2019s partner, Joshua Volasgis, punches Keunang \u201ctwo, three times in the facial area,\u201d he tells investigators, according to Jeff Sharlet of GQ magazine, who reviewed the footage and the police reports.\n\nKeunang is caught in the wire from two Tasers. He is being shocked repeatedly. He is being punched. He begins spinning wildly. Volasgis shouts: \u201cHe has my gun! He has my gun!\u201d\n\nThen an officer raises his gun and shoots Charly Keunang.\n\nThe officers look for Volasgis\u2019 gun in Charly\u2019s hand, but it is not in Charly\u2019s hand. It is not on the ground. It is not in the tent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe gun is still in Volasgis\u2019 holster.\n\nThe LAPD released an \u201cenhanced image\u201d from another officer\u2019s camera that supposedly shows Keunang grabbing an officer\u2019s weapon, although the family\u2019s attorneys say that they cannot see it. Eleven months later, a closed-door hearing conducted by the Los Angeles Police Commission would reach the same conclusion: that Keunang died after grabbing a policeman\u2019s weapon. City prosecutors would never file charges against the officers.\n\nCharly \u201cAfrica\u201d Keunang is dead.\n\nStill.\n\nHe would be approximately the 175th person shot and killed by police in 2015, according to GQ magazine.

The killing sparked two weeks of protest from unarmed Black Lives Matter demonstrators carrying signs proclaiming, \"I am Mike Brown\" and \"Hands up, don\u2019t shoot.\"\n\nThey faced off against a militarized force of Ferguson police using armored vehicles and rooftop snipers. It was a visual demonstration\u2014as clear as when Birmingham, Ala., Police Chief Bull Connor turned German shepherds and water hoses on African-American schoolchildren in 1963\u2014of how far a white supremacist police structure would be willing to protect a social hierarchy that made black bodies expendable, their deaths explainable and the protests of the black community discountable.\n\nBut Ferguson was also a pivot point for Black Lives Matter, a movement that started as a hashtag, created three years prior by three black women, two of whom are queer: Alicia Garza, Patrisse Khan-Cullors and Opal Tometi. Ferguson would prove to be the catalyst for Black Lives Matter moving from being a #hashtag movement to a tangible one in the streets of America. And as it has matured, the potential for it to become the most powerful mass movement for racial justice in the 21st century is real.\n\nWatching Black Lives Matter activists in Ferguson, I knew that there would be blowback, particularly from the white community, over this direct confrontation of white police power. After all, when Black Lives Matter was formed after the acquittal of non-police officer George Zimmerman for the killing of Trayvon Martin in 2011, one of the initial reactions of many in white America was that \"All lives matter.\"\n\nBut a curious thing happened in the two years after Ferguson. More white, Asian and Latino allies began understanding, translating to their own communities and fighting alongside African Americans behind the Black Lives Matter banner. Instead of embracing intentional ignorance over the meaning of Black Lives Matter, multiracial allies owned the work of opening up a dialogue over systemic police brutality, including white bodies being killed by police lethal use of force.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the past two years, it\u2019s become clear that one of the genius moves by founders Garza, Tometi and Cullors was to make Black Lives Matter a grassroots, nonhierarchal and inclusive movement. Traditionally, black racial-justice movements have been primarily patriarchal and top-down\u2014from the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund as it was led by Thurgood Marshall to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, led by Martin Luther King Jr., to the Black Panthers led by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale\u2014while hundreds of others, black women, gays and lesbians, have usually stayed in the background.\n\nBy rejecting that patriarchal model and giving power to grassroots chapters versus a main corporate headquarters, Black Lives Matter empowered women like Marissa Johnson, a Black Lives Matter activist from Seattle, to disrupt a Bernie Sanders campaign stop on the one-year anniversary of the death of Mike Brown. Her demands? That Sanders, who had, to date, couched all of his policies in economic terms, both acknowledge the Black Lives Matter movement and create policy surrounding systemic racism.\n\nDays later, Sanders hired a Black Lives Matter activist and put together a policy paper on police brutality. That one act, along with Black Lives Matter protests throughout the Democratic presidential nomination process\u2014such as when protesters confronted the eventual Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton\u2014resulted in talk about systemic racism and police brutality becoming part of the 2016 presidential campaign on the Democratic side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Ferguson also taught us something else that should be a warning shot for those who support the Black Lives Matter movement. Since Black Lives Matter is one that intentionally goes without a leader, there are people who wish to fill the void. African-American racial-justice organizations have always been destroyed through the targeting of so-called leaders who, once neutralized, have the effect of making the organization impotent.\n\nThus, more importantly, Black Lives Matter is successful because it doesn\u2019t need a man leading it. It\u2019s a racial social-justice organization that wasn\u2019t founded by men, and yes, that\u2019s a good thing. By having black men take a step back from using our privilege to drown out the voices of black women, gays and lesbians, it allows us to see the full humanity within our community.\n\nFor example, the #SayHerName hashtag has been a subset within the Black Lives Matter movement that has addressed the reality that the reaction within the black community to black bodies being killed is not equal. When black men die at the hands of white police, black women rush to the front lines to defend the humanity of their black sons, brothers, fathers, husbands and lovers, and do it unflinchingly. On the other hand, a combination of patriarchy, misogyny and sexism has resulted in an opposite reaction from black men when police kill black women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe names of Sandra Bland, Korryn Gaines and dozens of other black women killed by the police often get the \u201cYeah \u2026 but she wasn\u2019t perfect\u201d treatment from black men\u2014the same black men who would be outraged if being perfect were a standard that white \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d activists imposed on their humanity. This is a standard that Mike Brown assuredly couldn\u2019t pass. And yet, having black women as leaders and not as addendums of Black Lives Matter means that we\u2019re closer to addressing the inequities within our own community that are created by patriarchy, misogyny and sexism.\n\nAnd if Black Lives Matter weren't constructed as it is, the discussion of black lives and police violence would certainly remain a binary one that would exclude the lives of black LGBT people. For example, Bayard Rustin, the chief architect of the civil rights nonviolent movement, and an openly gay black man, remained in the shadows of the civil rights movement in the 1960s, even as it was his methods that changed American society. Black Lives Matter demands that everyone has worth.\n\nOf course, not everything has gone smoothly over the past two years. There was the dangerous accusation from some in white America that being supportive of Black Lives Matter was being anti-police, which was, as Mother would say \u2026 a bold-faced lie. But as Joseph Goebbels, the notorious Nazi minister of propaganda, once said, \u201cIf you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it.\u201d Telling and retelling that lie of Black Lives Matter being anti-police was the goal of the political right in this country and, often, was part of the talking points for the police as they tried to connect any violence against the police to the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA confluence between that big lie and real-life events happened after five Dallas police officers were fatally gunned down during a peaceful Black Lives Matter march over the police killings of two black men: Philando Castile outside St. Paul, Minn., and Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, La. And when three Baton Rouge police officers were killed by a Missouri man, it seemed as if the big lie about Black Lives Matter being anti-police would destroy the organization.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t.\n\nInstead, those affiliated with Black Lives Matter gathered to create a comprehensive set of policy solutions, first with Campaign Zero last year, and now the Movement for Black Lives. For every Black Lives Matter critic who asks, \"What is the goal of Black Lives Matter?\" these campaigns lay out solutions, addressing everything from police brutality, the militarization of police and the broken-windows policies that create over-policing in black and minority communities, to independent boards to investigate police shootings. It\u2019s comprehensive, and also just the beginning. Future Black Lives Matter policy positions will take on issues like immigration reform and immigration rights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s the sign of a maturing social movement that in just two years, Black Lives Matter has moved from the streets of Ferguson to affecting policy in this country. And like all other racial-justice movements, it, too, will morph into a more complex organization as it grows through the years. But what Black Lives Matter won\u2019t do is go away. And that\u2019s probably Mike Brown\u2019s greatest legacy: that his death helped empower a Black Lives Matter movement that will eventually prevent future Mike Browns.\n\nLawrence Ross is the author of the Los Angeles Times best-seller The Divine Nine: The History of African American Fraternities and Sororities.

We\u2019d fallen in love with the looks served alongside the lyrics, the black panthers prancing alongside Lamar, and the black excellence on full display, climaxing in that dazzling black-and-gold tableau (at the 2:59 mark) clearly created by British-Liberian artist Lina Iris Viktor in the style of her Constellations art series ... *record scratch.*\n\nOK, in homage to Viktor?\n\nUnfortunately, neither is the case, though Lamar, director Dave Meyers and their little friends\u2014I mean, \u201cthe little homies\u201d\u2014will likely claim otherwise. As revealed by the New York Times on Sunday, Viktor was unaware that her signature artistic style had been co-opted for the scene until friends began showering her with accolades for contributing to the video. [Editor\u2019s note: As of press time, Viktor could not be reached for comment. Lamar and Meyers either refused comment or did not respond to requests for comment by the Times.]\n\nAnd perhaps the imitation would\u2019ve been at least mildly flattering, except for one thing: She\u2019d already said no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it turns out, Viktor was purportedly contacted not once, but twice, with requests to use her art in association with Black Panther\u2014first for the film itself, and a year later to be a contributor to the artistic campaign for the film. The first offer didn\u2019t meet her financial requirements; the second would\u2019ve required her to exclusively license the work she produced to Marvel and Disney, likely putting into jeopardy an upcoming solo exhibition. Regardless, she was well within her rights to decline.\n\n\u201cWe walked away. That\u2019s the last I heard,\u201d Viktor told the New York Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo one can only imagine her shock and anger in discovering that someone\u2014or several someones\u2014on Lamar\u2019s production team felt entitled enough to mimic her work for \u201cAll the Stars.\u201d As Viktor\u2019s lawyer Christopher Robinson told the Times: \u201cWe\u2019re in an age when \u2018no\u2019 is supposed to mean \u2018no\u2019 in whatever field you\u2019re in ... [i]t\u2019s outrageous that they\u2019re taking advantage of her.\u201d\n\nBut there are far deeper implications here, especially since Lamar and Co. are likely aware that in art, as in fashion, \u201cstyle\u201d is not protected. While clearly inspired by Viktor\u2019s work, nothing we saw in \u201cAll the Stars\u201d was a clear forgery, meaning that her recourse may be limited, but what we indisputably have here is a particularly grimy case of appropriation.\n\nIt\u2019s a bitter pill to swallow, particularly from a rapper who is widely considered perhaps the most \u201cwoke\u201d of his generation\u2014though this is not the first time he\u2019s been accused of swagger-jacking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdding to that, what does it mean for a black male artist at the top of his career\u2014taking home five new Grammys mere weeks ago\u2014to poach from a black female artist arguably on the verge of a breakthrough in hers? What level of arrogance and cognitive dissonance does one have to have to admire someone\u2019s work, yet risk diminishing it by imitating it?\n\nCulturally, black people have become experts at calling out appropriation when we see it\u2014and occasionally been called appropriators in return. Black Panther has been no exception, whether weathering speculation about how it perpetuates stereotypes or taking criticism for not actually filming the fictional Wakanda in Africa.\n\nBut while those debates may ultimately be matters of opinion, this situation is ripe for a discussion about cultural currency, who possesses it and who feels entitled enough to wield it, regardless of who else might end up collateral damage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhy would they do this?\u201d Viktor asked the New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s an ethical issue, because what the whole film purports is that it\u2019s about black empowerment, African excellence\u2014that\u2019s the whole concept of the story. And at the same time, they\u2019re stealing from African artists.\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cAll the Stars\u201d would arguably be less stellar without the climactic black-and-gold scene, the insistence upon appropriating Viktor\u2019s work\u2014despite her express wishes not to be involved\u2014raises deep questions about our allegiances to one another, both artistically and culturally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWere those 19 seconds worth betraying another artist? And even if and when the law doesn\u2019t protect us, shouldn\u2019t we feel the least obligation to protect\u2014or, at least, respect\u2014one another?\n\nOne can only hope that Lamar\u2019s camp finds a way to make this right with Lina Iris Viktor\u2014especially since, for us, at least, the video is now tainted by the knowledge that all of the intellectual property wasn\u2019t given willingly.

Everything is about to change\u2014or so it seems\u2014as designers present fashion shows featuring clothes generally intended to break the rules. But one thing rarely, if ever, seems to change, and that\u2019s the absence of black designers occupying top spots in the fashion industry.\n\nFreelance designer and journalist Kibwe Chase-Marshall recently published an op-ed in Business of Fashion\u2014one of the most respected media outlets for fashion-industry reporting\u2014titled, \u201cWhy Aren\u2019t There More Black Designers?\u201d It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve asked myself nearly every time I\u2019ve gone into work over my 30-year career in fashion. Why?\n\nAll too often, I\u2019m the only person of color on set doing any job. The rare exception is on the catwalk, where the sheer number of people required to produce a fashion show calls for hiring more than one black person, simply by default. But when the final bow is taken, it is almost never a black designer who has the chance to receive either kudos or a career-ending critique from the press.\n\nChase-Marshall\u2014who worked in high-level but never top-tier jobs, such as vice president or head designer, for firms like Michael Kors, Isaac Mizrahi and Oscar de la Renta\u2014found himself repeatedly slamming up against a glass ceiling. And now he\u2019s breaking that glass ceiling by breaking the silence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Jan. 3, an action-oriented social media campaign, #BreakSilenceBreakCeilings, went live. The campaign was conceived by Chase-Marshall and aimed at breaking the unwritten and unspoken rule of discriminatory hiring practices in fashion, an industry that Chase-Marshall says does not have a \u201cdiversity problem\u201d but, rather, a \u201cblack-people problem.\u201d\n\nHimself a talented technical draftsman, stylist and cutter, Chase-Marshall is not content to simply illustrate the talent of black designers as a solution to the problem. In February, I was on a steering committee for the Black Designers Exhibition and Symposium at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, which shed light on the fierce beauty of too-little-seen talent and started the conversation as to why\u2014but did not offer us a plan to advance the battle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChase-Marshall has tailored a solution to fit the problem, noting in his op-ed, \u201cFed up with watching this most blatant form of discrimination thrive, while the broader industry capitalizes on Black celebrity associations and the recent uptick in Black casting, I decided to do something.\u201d\n\nChase-Marshall, who stopped working full time in design studios in 2010 after 13 years, now makes a living as a freelance designer and writer for publications like Elle. He has devised a plan of action for the Council of Fashion Designers of America and Vogue, which collaborate on the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund, the most powerful entity in the American\u2014if not global\u2014luxury-garment industry, which has promoted some of the most successful black designers in recent memory, such as Tracy Reese and Cushnie and Ochs.\n\nChase-Marshall would like to see CFDA/Vogue adopt a program with greater oversight of its design-industry members, such as offering immersive training for hiring managers in elimination of bias, along with CFDA/Vogue\u2019s annual disclosure and endorsement of participating brands, along with annual statistics regarding the racial composition of their design teams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s what the industry can do, but to consumers who want to take a stand against inequality and appropriation, Chase-Marshall posted:\n\nLet\u2019s do something: If you agree that it\u2019s time for the community of fashion design professionals to be taken to task regarding employment/advancement discrimination against qualified black candidates, along with liking this post, comment #breaksilencebreakceilings and tag @CFDA, @Voguemagazine, @Bof, @nytimes, and @wwd below. In addition, forward this post to 5 friends (or more) that you feel care to affect overdue change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlackness, until very recently, was seen as an unmarketable quality,\u201d says Chase-Marshall, who hails from Trinidad, was raised in Washington, D.C., and was a classmate of the Clinton and Gore children. But despite having the clubby connections to wealth and power that headhunters prize for their potential to move the needle when it comes to selling expensive designer clothing, he was discounted, simply because of the color of his skin.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if someone is racist,\u201d Chase-Marshall says. \u201cI care if people use discriminatory hiring practices.\u201d His is neither a call for affirmative action nor a call for quotas\u2014which can undercut recognition of real talent\u2014but, rather, a call for education transparency and accountability that can create lasting change within the fashion industry.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m proud of Chase-Marshall for pushing us beyond merely saying that we have the right to more than just exist and be seen in the fashion industry. It\u2019s our responsibility to demand, not only of fashion but also of our trendsetting selves, that our spending be reflected in the identities of the images marketed to us, as well as that our dollars come back into our communities through the black talent being paid and promoted according to their true worth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInspired by Muhammad Ali and Colin Kaepernick, Chase-Marshall, who currently engages in every type of freelance work, from designing pull-up diapers to diamond rings, wants to be the kind of person who \u201cprioritizes their integrity over their paycheck.\u201d He broke his silence \u201cbecause you can\u2019t continue to play a losing game.\u201d Now it\u2019s time for the powerful consumers black women are to suit up and make the fashion industry play ball.", "keywords": ["hiring", "missing", "black", "action", "designers", "chasemarshall", "simply", "industry", "designer", "problem", "fashion", "talent"], "polarity": 0.12858133650387174, "subjectivity": 0.4944134503993659},

In the past four years, the third-generation hairstylist has been making her mark on Marvel films, leading the hair departments of the last two Captain America films, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and, now, Black Panther.\n\nOf course, the Black Panther is a unique superhero, and Black Panther is already proving to be an exceptionally unique film, as Friend tells The Glow Up:\n\nI think Black Panther is\u2014I call it a stand-alone Marvel movie, even though Marvel still has a formula. But I feel like it\u2019s a stand-alone movie, especially for me, because I\u2019m a black woman, and [to do] the first black superhero, that was really an honor, in the sense [that] we\u2019re presenting all of this to the world. We had an important job to do, and I looked at it in a whole different way, because it represents my people. So I felt like, the weight of the world on me at some points, but in the greatest way\u2014that I had the opportunity to present us in the best possible light and put something on camera that\u2019s never been [seen]. So it\u2019s a great responsibility and it\u2019s a great challenge, but it\u2019s my greatest joy in doing it, also.\n\nRepresenting her people was paramount in Friend\u2019s mind as she approached the task of helping to bring Black Panther to life. To begin, she divided the film into three elements: traditional Africa, contemporary Africa and the futuristic Africa represented by the technologically advanced civilization that is Wakanda. In her research, she drew inspiration from everything from traditional African tribes like the Maasai and Zulu to the groundbreaking fashion statements we\u2019ve seen at Afropunk celebrations around the globe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really taking and looking at traditional styles, traditional tribal looks, and seeing what we can make into a modern style,\u201d Friend says. \u201cI like to take, like, a period hairstyle and put it in a modern movie and just put a twist on it. For me, it\u2019s still about classic hairdressing and beautiful lines and silhouettes. That\u2019s how I design hair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriend has certainly had her share of experience with period styles, having also headed the hair departments of Miles Ahead, The Help, Django Unchained, Rock of Ages and Dreamgirls. But whether it\u2019s long and flowing or elaborately braided and twisted, one thing you won\u2019t see in Black Panther is any straightened hair. For Friend, natural hair textures were a major part of her contribution to the visual narrative.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a beautiful time where people are wearing their natural hair,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, there [are] women everywhere who are like, \u2018Throw the pressing comb away, throw the relaxer away. I\u2019m going to wear my natural hair.\u2019 So that whole movement of the empowerment of the hair is there,\u201d Friend explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a diverse universe of naturally styled characters involved a team highly skilled in styling, caring for and mimicking natural hairstyles, as in the case of Angela Bassett\u2019s glorious custom-made wig of 24-inch silvery locs, inspired in equal parts by writer Toni Morrison and director Ryan Coogler\u2019s mother, Joselyn.\n\nBut while Friend isn\u2019t playing favorites on the styles she created, she\u2019s already seeing the influence this film is having on our beauty and fashion choices. She\u2019s received countless raves on the twisted crop Lupita Nyong\u2019o rocks as Dora Milaje operative Nakia and graciously provided The Glow Up with the how-to (hint: The key is keeping it close to the scalp):\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018Wakanda knot\u2019\u2014because it is different than a Bantu knot,\u201d she tells us. \u201c[Because] basically, the hair is rolled down, kind of like a cinnamon roll. And then, once the hair is dried, then, we lifted it from there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEducating other hairstylists is a huge part of Friend\u2019s career, as her greatest hope is to see more hairstylists performing at the top of their game. That\u2019s why she created Hair Scholars, a consortium of award-winning artists led by Friend in educating and preparing aspiring stylists to be the best at their craft and ready to work in the industry.\n\nFriend knows firsthand the value of having a talented team by her side. She credits her Black Panther team for being a large part of the inspiration and craftsmanship that we\u2019ll see on-screen next week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt just felt like our brains\u2014the brainpower was just so high, and the energy was so high, just because we got to create,\u201d she says. \u201cOr somebody\u2019s like, \u2018Well, let\u2019s try this.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Let\u2019s try it!\u2019\n\n\u201cSo it was really great to have that think tank, where we could just be in there and be creating, and just really coming up with things on the fly ... just really having the momentum just to create original pieces that are going to stand the test of time on film,\u201d she continues.\n\nAnd of course, we couldn\u2019t end our conversation without asking Friend how it felt to be on the purple carpet for Black Panther\u2019s epic premiere in Los Angeles last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe premiere was like, you know, it was like 2018 Coming to America\u2014like, it was for real. People took it all the way,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think what it is too, is as black people, we have like\u2014especially now\u2014there\u2019s a sense of pride. People are wearing their hair natural. People are [saying] \u2018black excellence.\u2019 People are rising to the occasion, and I think this movie comes at the time where black people, we want to step forward; we want to be recognized.\n\n\u201cThis movie hits all the right notes for having a black superhero,\u201d she explains. \u201cI mean, at the end of the day, we all want to be superheroes, in whatever we do. If we\u2019re a mom, if we\u2019re a secretary, if we\u2019re a hairdresser\u2014whatever we do, we all want to be a superhero.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re an Los Angeles-based hair artist, you can join Camille Friend for a Hair Scholars master class at the \u201cHair and Makeup by ... \u201d Symposium on March 11 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.", "keywords": ["meet", "hero", "hair", "black", "panther", "camille", "friend", "movie", "traditional", "designer", "really", "panthers", "teamsupernatural", "natural", "think", "having"], "polarity": 0.17398076259489295, "subjectivity": 0.5284920634920632},

And that passion, that pain, spilled over into her funeral service Monday evening.\n\n\n\nHer father was Eric Garner, whose last moments were captured on video as he sputtered, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d 11 times on July 27, 2014. For Eric Garner, there was no reprieve from literal oppression. It killed him on that day. And his daughter, who was radicalized by his death, never stopped in her quest to garner justice for him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHundreds of mourners packed into First Corinthian Baptist Church in Harlem for the funeral, which at times seemed more like a production than a homegoing ceremony for the 27-year-old mother of two. Erica Garner was, above all else, a young black woman who, by some stroke of tragic luck, was thrust into activism because of the random, pervasive nature of police brutality in America.\n\nErica Garner died on Dec. 30 of a heart attack, months after giving birth to her son, Eric, named for her late father. Her mother spoke plaintively of her daughter during the service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe was born at seven-and-a-half months, 4 pounds, 11 ounces, but she proved to be a giant,\u201d said Esaw Snipes-Garner, who recalled her daughter\u2019s brazen determination.\n\n\n\nSnipes-Garner said that she would beg Erica not to go out to protest, as she did twice a week for a year, trudging out to the Staten Island Ferry station, thick with commuters, rain or shine, to bring light to the nonindictment of the police officer who held her father in that fatal choke hold; a man still employed with the New York City Police Department.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t take care of these kids,\u201d Snipes-Garner said she told her, which, she noted, wryly, is exactly what she is now doing. \u201cShe lived on her own terms. And she died on her own terms.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer mom spoke of Erica\u2019s fiery spirit; her obstinate, aggressive belief in herself and her choices; and her unyielding love for her father. She also spoke proudly of the day Erica shut down New York\u2019s Verrazano Bridge, an eight-lane edifice that connects the New York City boroughs of Staten Island and Brooklyn.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe did it by herself,\u201d her mother said. \u201cEight lanes of traffic. She said, \u2018I can\u2019t breathe.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton, who did Erica\u2019s eulogy, also told that story.\n\nHe recounted: \u201cErica calls, and says, \u2018I done blocked two streets, but they won\u2019t arrest me.\u2019\u201d Sharpton said he responded that maybe the NYPD didn\u2019t want to touch the daughter of Eric Garner. So she responded, \u201cI stopped traffic and they won\u2019t arrest me. I\u2019m going to the bridge.\u201d And she did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis was a real warrior,\u201d Sharpton boomed. \u201cShe didn\u2019t care about awards or press, she cared about justice!\u201d\n\n\n\nSharpton said that Erica didn\u2019t die of a heart attack but of a heart that was attacked, after seeing her father so brutally snuffed out with no recompense. The unfairness of it all; the unjustness of it all; the pain of her worst pain splayed out for all to see.\n\n\n\nThere were speeches. Sen. Bernie Sanders, for whom Erica campaigned in 2016, sent a letter. Sharpton acknowledged the people of note in attendance. There were lots of men in dark suits, mostly politicians and preachers (in Harlem, they\u2019re often one and the same, going back to Adam Clayton Powell Jr.); there were beautiful songs sung.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was also a verbal and apparently physical altercation during the service, which turned out to be family members fighting with Eric Garner\u2019s mother, Gwen Carr, who said that she and her husband were turned away and attacked by other family members.\n\nAs the commotion took place, Sharpton stepped up as it was happening and said, \u201cEveryone has family divisions. We have to respect Erica,\u201d and the program moved on. Sharpton later lamented, \u201cAll of us have feuds, all of us have differences. I have some in my family I don\u2019t speak to now. And I\u2019m saved.\u201d And again, he said, \u201cThis is about Erica.\u201d\n\nActivists, many of whom were outside because they could not get into the funeral, decried politics, where men who did not know Erica well and politicians were given pride of place at the service, when they could not get in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne activist, who was heckling writer and activist Shaun King outside the services, shouted, \u201cErica wasn\u2019t even from Harlem, so why was her funeral here?\u201d\n\nRapper Common came, saying that he had to pay his respects to the Garner family and the people. He said he\u2019d met Erica at an action once and was touched by her spirit.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to fight, and keep fighting, not only for the injustices, but for the positivity and the grace and the gifts that we\u2019ve been given from God,\u201d said Common. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna keep fighting for those things, that always will be there for us, and we\u2019ll keep fighting for our young people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMike Brown Sr., the father of Mike Brown, the 18-year-old killed by a Ferguson, Mo., police officer mere weeks after Eric Garner was killed, also came to pay his respects.\n\n\n\n\u201cI had to show my support for the family,\u201d he told The Root. \u201cThe family has been there with our family from day one. It was my duty to come out and show the family the love that they\u2019ve shown us.\u201d\n\nAbout Erica, Brown said simply: \u201cShe said what she said, she meant what she meant.\u201d", "keywords": ["mother", "fighting", "unapologetic", "marred", "dispute", "father", "told", "spirit", "warrior", "funeral", "garner", "garners", "eric", "family", "diminished", "sharpton", "erica"], "polarity": 0.02373737373737374, "subjectivity": 0.43321717171717183},

I\u2019d heard and read rumbles about the possibility of a very public act of defiance toward our overtly racist president, and I was curious how that\u2019d look. Especially after a year of very public political protests and Trump\u2019s telling responses to them.\n\nWould they collectively decide not to attend? Would they kneel at their seats in an obvious nod to Colin Kaepernick\u2019s protest (and Trump\u2019s reaction to it)? Would they walk out? Would they stand up and turn their backs to him while he was speaking, like several of the people in the room did when Omarosa spoke at a National Association of Black Journalists conference?\n\nBut, as I learned Wednesday morning, they chose a different route.

For the first 32 years of its existence, the Black Panther\u2014created by Marvel Comics legends Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1966\u2014had been written by whites. Christopher Priest and Hudlin, two very talented black writers, drastically changed the direction of the character when they took over his adventures in 1998 and 2005, respectively. Under their collective direction, the character\u2014the king and head priest of a Bast-worshipping, xenophobic African nation who had never been invaded by European colonialists\u2014was infused with an African-centered, self-determining ethos. In his run, Hudlin decided to shake up the Marvel fanbase by making the character a truly \u201cBlack\u201d Panther, an unapologetic African man openly opposed to white, Western supremacy.\n\n\n\nWith the Black Panther happily in vogue, I wanted to point out two important stories written by filmmaker Reginald Hudlin, the former BET executive who made that Black Panther animated miniseries in 2010.\n\n\n\nThe first story is \u201cBlack to the Future,\u201d in the first-ever Panther annual published in 2008. The plot: in one possible future, Hudlin shows one of the Panther\u2019s and Storm\u2019s sons marrying the U.S. President, the daughter of former Avengers leader Luke Cage! This story, much of it told in flashback, answers an honest, real-world question: how did Wakanda escape being colonized without going to war against the entire Western world? The answer: the Wakandans made a pact with the white European colonial powers: if you don\u2019t make war on Wakanda, Wakandans will turn a blind eye to the Trans-Atlantic slave trade and European colonialism of the rest of Africa.\n\n\n\nThe story, which balanced Wakanda\u2019s past and possible future, seemed to be a return to the serious European colonization themes of Hudlin\u2019s first story arc, \u201cWho is the Black Panther?\u201d a story which he adapted to that cartoon (and has since been novelized).\n\n\n\nThe second of Hudlin\u2019s greatest Panther stories is one of the greatest Panther stories ever. It used the idea, first developed by Christopher J. Priest (the Panther\u2019s previous writer and Marvel\u2019s first Black editor), then furthered by Hudlin, that an ancestor Panther met Captain America in Wakanda during World War II!\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCaptain America/Black Panther: Flags of Our Fathers, a 2010 mini-series drawn by Denys Cowan, the African-American artist who was one of the co-founders of Milestone Comics, expands on that story greatly. It tells a tale of white/Aryan racism and American militarism from the point of view of Gabriel Jones, the sole Black member of Sgt. Nick Fury\u2019s \u201cHowling Commandos\u201d U.S. Army Ranger squad. (This the same military unit Steve Rogers led in the first Captain America movie.)\n\n\n\nIn this story, Captain America and the Howling Commandos are sent to prod Wakanda to the side of the Allies in World War II. Azzuri, the Black Panther (T\u2019Challa\u2019s grandfather), tells the Americans that Wakanda will remain neutral. Meanwhile, the Red Skull and other Aryan supervillains under his command\u2014portrayed as unapologetic white supremacists and open racists\u2014attempt to invade Wakanda, wanting its vibranium.\n\n\n\n(Of course, America wants the vibranium, too; Fury tells Jones to spy for America and steal a sample.)\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones, who is as impressed with Wakanda as Azzuri and the Wakandans are with him, has to decide whose side he will ultimately serve.\n\n\n\nAs a writer, Hudlin would not win any awards for subtlety. But looking at his complete body of Panther work, why he chose such a ham-fisted but potent approach was not hard to understand.\n\n\n\nHudlin clearly saw comic book writing not as a novel with pictures or a forum for deep psychological insights, but as a romp through the imagination, with the opportunity to strike pop satire notes and illustrate socio-political points. In a way, his approach was not that much different from (Panther creators) Stan Lee\u2019s and Jack Kirby\u2019s in the 1960s, before comic creators became enamored with literary pretentions. Also, Comics were not Hudlin\u2019s day job, so he could\u2014and did\u2014have fun.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn terms of public reach, Hudlin made a much greater mark on the character than anyone before him combined.\n\n\n\nHudlin not only kept the character alive in a title, but because of the digital comic/animated series that aired on BET (with a small-but-important assist from the Panther\u2019s recurring appearances on Avengers: Earth\u2019s Mightiest Heroes, the animated series which aired on the Disney XD channel from 2010 to 2013), he singlehandedly made him Black America\u2019s best-known Black superhero not named Static or Blade. Black Americans who had never gone, and perhaps never would go, into a comic book shop now knew who the Black Panther was by name; they had seen or heard about the digital comic/animated mini-series that was sold in stores, aired on BET, and, as of 2018, is still available illegally somewhere online. The fact that the Panther was unapologetically Black in that mini-series significantly added to that popularity.\n\n\n\nThe filmmaker, a huge Black comic book fanboy, did the job he set out to do: he kept Panther\u2019s A-list standing among comic book fans while making him an A-lister in the 21st century Black popular imagination, right next to 20th and early 21st-century Black fantasy male icons like John Shaft, Hawk, and Blade.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe turbo-charged Panther\u2019s coolness factor.\n\n\n\nHudlin acted in the tradition of Denny O\u2019Neil and Neal Adams\u2019s early 1970s Green Lantern/Green Arrow comic book title, in deftly combining bluntly socio-political content with action.\n\n\n\nAnd notably, with the creation (by Hudlin) of T\u2019Challa\u2019s sister, Princess Shuri, who grew into a strong, competent, grown-ass African woman warrior in her own right, he made the Panther title reflect Black feminism in a stronger way. No longer were Black women characters in Black Panther relegated to girlfriends/wives/fianc\u00e9es, kidnap victims, scorned women, sarcastic teenage sidekicks, or sexy, mostly silent bodyguards.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil T\u2019Challa\u2019s film debut in 2016\u2019s Captain America: Civil War, it was Hudlin\u2019s (animated) Panther that was the one most non-comic book-reading Black people knew about.\n\nCopyright 2018 by Diasporic Africa Press.\n\n", "keywords": ["reginald", "black", "partly", "panther", "marvel", "character", "movie", "hudlin", "panthers", "book", "war", "comic", "wakanda", "america"], "polarity": 0.09702287946428571, "subjectivity": 0.4092819940476186},

There is no white guy born on a distant planet who came to Kansas and discovered that he could fly. If you are ever bitten by a bat, you probably want to get a tetanus shot before making plans to build your bat cave. When I was 8, I tried to convince my cousin to let a radioactive spider (I had put it in the microwave) bite him, but for some reason he had no interest in becoming Spider-Man.\n\n\n\nAnd, of course, when black America streams into movie theaters on Feb. 15 and 16, we\u2019ll do so knowing that Black Panther has nothing to do with reality. We are well aware that there was never a hidden African country so rich that its king would have been the wealthiest man who ever existed. Sure, there were rich African countries, but the leader of the fictional land of Wakanda is supposedly so wealthy that it is impossible to calculate his wealth. Of course, it is a fictional comic book tale that could never really happen.\n\nExcept it did.\n\nIn 1324 Musa I, the 10th Mansa, or king, of the West African empire of Mali, began his 4,000-mile pilgrimage to Mecca. Before his hajj, the African and the Muslim worlds had heard little about the emperor who was uniting many parts of modern-day Mauritania and Mali (Melle), and the tale was unknown to most of Europe. But after his trip, Mansa Musa literally put the kingdom of Mali on the map, and to this very day, historians universally consider him the richest person who ever lived.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo abundant is the gold which is found in his country that he is the richest and most noble king in the land.\u201d \u2014Spanish cartographer, 1375\n\nMusa didn\u2019t gain his wealth through an internet-software startup or the stock market\u2014he got it the old-fashioned way: He earned it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was born around 1280 as \u201cKanga Musa,\u201d a name that refers to his mother, Kankou Hamidou, in the matriarchal Mandinka society. Although his father was not a royal, Musa was appointed a \u201cdeputy\u201d to the empire and assumed the throne in 1312 when the previous king took a pilgrimage to Mecca and did not return.\n\nWhile Europe was slowly emerging from the famine, war, disease and mass poverty that killed 1 in every 10 Europeans between 1315 and 1316, Musa was building universities, mosques and city centers throughout the empire of Mali. Instead of conquering through war, he expanded his empire through annexation as he used his control of gold and salts to connect disparate city-states into one empire. It is said that by the end of his life, it would have taken an entire year to go from one end of the Mali empire to the other.\n\nBecause of this, Mansa earned more titles than a Game of Thrones character. He was called Emir of Melle, Lord of the Mines of Wangara, Conqueror of Ghanata, Lion of Mali. The only titles he never earned were Mother of Dragons and King of the North. At its height, scholars say, the kingdom had 400 densely populated cities in the Niger Delta. The University of Sankore in Timbuktu, Mali, still stands where he built it after conquering the area.\n\nWestern Europe was basically the PJs, and Mansa Musa\u2019s West African empire was the deluxe apartment in the sky.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite his immense wealth and power, very few outside of Africa knew of Mansa until his pilgrimage. Most accounts say that he took 60,000 men on his trip with him and balled out along the way, much to white people\u2019s dismay.\n\nNever one to be stingy with his money, Musa is reported to have handed out gold bars to poor people along his travel route. Almost every version of his hajj tells the same story: King Musa handed out so much gold to the poor, it actually collapsed the entire gold market in the Middle East! To use the academic terms of macroeconomics, Mansa made it rain so much in da\u2019 club, everyone else in the world look broke by comparison!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what did he do to fix this?\n\nIn perhaps the greatest money move ever made, the king borrowed all of the gold his crew could carry from Cairo. Of course he didn\u2019t need it, but the scarcity of the precious metal settled the market. Then, like the baller he was, he simply repaid the Egyptian moneylenders back, plus interest.\n\nI\u2019m sure he also included a note that said: \u201cMy bad. I\u2019m not used to hanging out with broke people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen he returned to Mali, Musa brought back some of Spain\u2019s and Egypt\u2019s most prized architects and builders, creating an even wealthier kingdom. Historians say that by the time he returned from Mecca, he controlled most of the gold and salt in the Mediterranean. Coincidentally, this is when the kingdom of Mali began showing up on European maps.\n\nSo when you\u2019re fantasizing about a fictional African kingdom of untold fortune, remember that there was once a real king who could probably have lent T\u2019Challa a few dollars until Wakanda\u2019s vibranium check cleared the bank.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow and when Mansa Musa died is a topic of fierce debate, but in our extensive research, we could not determine whether Mansa Musa released his tax returns. We could, however, confirm that even after the death of Mansa Musa, for centuries the Mali kingdom made Western Europe look like a collection of shithole countries.", "keywords": ["mali", "europe", "musa", "mansa", "real", "kingdom", "african", "wealth", "empire", "king", "gold", "wakanda"], "polarity": 0.1177283105022831, "subjectivity": 0.409336812350511},

On Nov. 19, 2011, he somehow set off his medical device. When an emergency operator tried to talk to Chamberlain through a loudspeaker in his bedroom, he didn\u2019t respond, so she called an ambulance. The White Plains, N.Y., Police Department followed the ambulance to Chamberlain\u2019s home, where he answered the door.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe told the officers that everything was OK, but that wasn\u2019t enough. The medical-device operator personally called the White Plains Police Department to cancel the emergency call, but that wasn\u2019t enough, either. Chamberlain\u2019s niece, who lived downstairs, asked the cops to let her speak to him, but they wouldn\u2019t.\n\nThe cops insisted on coming in, so they tried to break down the door for over an hour. During that hour, the cops yelled at Chamberlain. They screamed for him to open the door. Chamberlain yelled through the door: \u201cI\u2019m a sick old man,\u201d to which Officer Stephen Hart replied, \u201cWe don\u2019t give a fuck, nigger!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the officers finally broke the door down, they shot the 68-year-old man with a Taser in the neck and abdomen. Then they shot him with a less-than-lethal beanbag from a shotgun. They hit him with a baton. Then one of the officers claimed that a 68-year-old man, who had already been shot with a Taser and a beanbag gun and couldn\u2019t walk 40 feet without wheezing, attacked them with a knife. So the officer shot Kenneth Chamberlain in the chest.\n\nTwice.\n\nFor five months, the police refused to identify the officer who shot Chamberlain. When the name of the officer, Anthony Carelli, was finally identified, he insisted that Chamberlain was going to kill him with the butcher knife he was holding as he charged at the officer. Even after the information came out that Carelli was facing a $10 million lawsuit for beating two brothers and calling them \u201crag heads,\u201d the Police Department, the police union and Carelli stuck with the story. They stuck by the story even when the autopsy showed that Chamberlain wasn\u2019t even facing the officer. They stuck by the story even when the coroner said that Chamberlain couldn\u2019t have been holding a knife. Carelli stuck by his story even after it was proved that Chamberlain\u2019s hands were at his side when he was shot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Anthony Carelli got away with it.\n\nHe didn\u2019t go to trial. A grand jury refused to indict the officers. A federal jury rejected a civil suit against Carelli and the city of White Plains in 2016 after the judge refused to allow evidence of the racial slurs or Carelli\u2019s past. Now Joon Kim, who replaced U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara when he was fired by President Donald Trump after refusing to resign, has announced that no civil rights charges will be filed, according to the Associated Press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement announcing his reasoning for closing the case, Kim said:\n\n\u201cOfficer Carelli believed that Sergeant Martin was in danger of being seriously injured by Mr. Chamberlain.

If you\u2019re triggered, it\u2019s because, throughout this mystifying film, Coogler reminds you of how close the themes are to what\u2019s happening or has happened in the world around us. The entire continent of Africa is often perceived as developing, when, in reality, it\u2019s a rich land of kings and queens.\n\nWakanda (much like another fan favorite with a nod to the Motherland, Coming to America\u2019s Zamunda) shows off its royalty through elaborate and blatant displays. Black Panther has a strong focus on legacy\u2014who gets to be a part of it, how far a king would go to protect his country\u2014but it also explores how the entire world changes because of an unexpected shakeup of political power (cough\u2014Donald Trump\u2014cough).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Panther is a Marvel Cinematic Universe that delivers a superhero story with heart, soul and rhythm. Black Panther confronts the conflict of being a wealthy nation refusing to disturb itself by helping the rest of the ailing world.\n\nYou can see immediately that the \u201cgood guy,\u201d T\u2019Challa, operates in a gray area. His choices are political and often clouded by his drive to protect his people. And even though the film is named for his superhero namesake and T\u2019Challa is one of the most complicated of heroes, Chadwick Boseman plays it in a way that makes room for his star-studded ensemble cast to shine bright.\n\n\n\nAnd no one shines like T\u2019Challa\u2019s little sister, Shuri (Letitia Wright). Wright is what Tiffany Haddish was to Girls Trip. Her hilarious one-liners from \u201cwhatter thooooosssee\u201d to \u201ccolonizer\u201d will have you wishing she was in every scene.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWright\u2019s Shuri works in the tech lab in the Wakanda kingdom. She\u2019s in charge of all things Black Panther. She rebels against the poised nature found in royal bloodlines and wins you over with her espressolike spunk, quick wit and mind-shattering tech talents. Shuri is a beacon for little black girls who may have been called nerds as if that were a bad thing. Watching Shuri bounce around her lab, decorated in funky paintings, walls vibrating with music, is like sharing dreams in color of all the young black girls who code.\n\n\n\nBlack Panther delivers a message of power in many forms to young black girls. Every female character in this film has an arc that makes her live long after the credits roll. Okoye (Danai Gurira) is a stunning character, but Gurira\u2019s portrayal of her makes me want to be a soldier\u2014not for America, of course\u2014for Wakanda. The Dora Milaje is a group of female soldiers devoted to T\u2019Challa\u2019s protection; they believe in their country over everything.\n\n\n\nI will not spoil it for you, but the fight scenes in which the Dora Milaje are featured will have you signing up for all kinds of self-defense courses. But it\u2019s Okoye and Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) who are the Beyonc\u00e9s of combat. As the leader of the Dora Milaje and a war dog, respectively, these women showcase a quiet inner and outer strength you\u2019d want the entire movie wrapped around. And it does.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack women are the stars here. From Okoye snatching off her own wig to Nakia using her heel as a weapon, there\u2019s no denying this ode to black women.\n\n\u201cShow them who you are.\u201d Ramonda (Angela Bassett) shouts at son T\u2019Challa during a battle for the throne. \u201cStand up. You are a king,\u201d T\u2019Challa\u2019s father, T\u2019Chaka says to him from the afterlife.\n\n\n\nThese may have been encouraging words for T\u2019Challa to dig in and fight harder, but they sank in for me. Black Panther was a full-on love letter to the Motherland, but there were also several smaller love notes to blackness throughout. Whether they were the cheers from Ramonda, or Nakia\u2019s Bantu knots, or the Wakanda dignitaries with lip plates, or Wakandans speaking isiXhosa, a South African language known for its tongue clicks, there was more than enough evidence of the appreciation and adoration for all things black in this film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven Black Panther\u2019s villain, Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), is someone to be proud of. Coogler uses him as a means to explore identity, legacy and the distress of black Americans.\n\n\n\nJordan\u2019s Killmonger just might be the best villain I\u2019ve seen since Heath Ledger\u2019s the Joker. You immediately think Marvel villain Ulysses Klaue is going to be who T\u2019Challa is up against, but Killmonger shuts that down quickly.\n\nKillmonger is undoubtedly scary and will end your life without a first, second or third thought, but his heart is actually in the right place. He wants to fight for the black people who are left in America\u2019s poverty and need just a taste of the riches Wakanda offers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe\u2019s the scariest villain because Killmonger actually believes in what he\u2019s doing, and, honestly, so will you. He\u2019s an advocate for black people outside of Wakanda. But we all know, black or white, Wakanda doesn\u2019t do outsiders. Without saying too much, sometimes it be your own people.\n\nKillmonger doesn\u2019t want to take Wakanda down. He wants everyone to have a piece of the kingdom\u2019s glory and is determined to make it happen by any means necessary\u2014even if that means taking down T\u2019Challa.\n\nIt\u2019s clear why Michael B. Jordan is one of Ryan Coogler\u2019s go-to stars. His range and depth are awe-inspiring. At one point, Killmonger shifts your entire morality by saying, \u201cBury me in the ocean where my ancestors jumped from ships because they knew death was better than bondage.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCoogler\u2019s genius can be seen and felt the entire time you\u2019re sitting there, thrown smack-dab into Wakanda. I get antsy after about an hour and a half during movies, but Black Panther held my attention far longer.\n\nLet\u2019s all do what we can to make sure Ryan Coogler stays protected because we need his genius. We need his storytelling and his ability to make T\u2019Challa and all of Wakanda jump off the comic book page with so much seasoning, I don\u2019t think we even deserve it.\n\nThis movie is the epitome of Issa Rae\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m rooting for everybody black.\u201d Black Panther is an entire body raised in goosebumps. It\u2019s a ride I wasn\u2019t ready for, but would gladly ride over and over again. I already know I\u2019m going to see this movie at least three more times. It\u2019s the same reason Black Panther\u2019s presale tickets have already outpaced those of any other superhero movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s about time we get to see our people in a movie like this. And this is only the beginning. We should all experience Black Panther.\n\n", "keywords": ["delivers", "panther", "black", "entire", "villain", "movie", "tchalla", "blackest", "killmonger", "biggest", "good", "shuri", "superhero", "world", "wakanda"], "polarity": 0.09222331630118515, "subjectivity": 0.47526997137652854},

OK.\n\nThe sweatshirt image caught the attention of New York Times columnist Charles M. Blow and prompted an instant uproar. Many threatened to boycott the Swedish chain after seeing the disturbing advertisement. Flocks of customers took to Twitter and Facebook voicing their concerns, demanding that the image be pulled down; others remained on the fence about H&M\u2019s intentions, claiming that the European retailer may be out of touch on such a loaded topic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe use of \u201cmonkey\u201d as a racist term has a deplorable history, dating back to the 1570s with the fable of a Portuguese woman being raped by an African ape and being forced to have its babies.\n\nInevitably, some will ignore that loaded history and argue that we live in an overly sensitive society where everything is offensive. And sure, we could simply blame this on poor judgment by H&M\u2019s marketing department. But that\u2019s a tough sell for Black Twitter, which isn\u2019t inclined to forgive so easily. After all, the retailer also featured two other hoodies on white children emblazoned with \u201cJunior Tour Guide\u201d and \u201cSurvival Expert\u201d\u2014though all of the hoodies have been pulled from the site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this is just the latest in a series of affronts by the fashion and beauty industries. Black people consistently remain under attack from careless tactics. In 2017 alone, we witnessed the moment when someone on Dove\u2019s marketing team thought this now infamous advertisement of a black woman transitioning into a white one was a brilliant idea.\n\nAnd how about when American Eagle thought it was genius to make a men\u2019s bracelet reminiscent of slave shackles? Even J. Crew\u2019s brand Madewell felt the burn in November, when staffers didn\u2019t even attempt to style a black model\u2019s hair. But relax, guys ... let\u2019s just ask Kendall Jenner to grab us all a Pepsi.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter an initial one-line apology fell flat, H&M issued the following statement to the press:\n\nWe understand that many people are upset about the image. We, who work at H&M, can only agree. We are deeply sorry that the picture was taken, and we also regret the actual print. Therefore, we have not only removed the image from our channels, but also the garment from our product offering globally. It is obvious that our routines have not been followed properly. This is without any doubt. We will thoroughly investigate why this happened to prevent this type of mistake from happening again.\ufeff\n\nBut we\u2019ve heard it all before; and as actress Alexandra Foucard stated on Twitter, \u201cAn apology is not enough.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow many more apologies should we expect to hear in 2018 before enough is enough? Or will it remain business as usual, with people of color simply awaiting the next \u201cmistake\u201d to happen at our expense?

Lee was an honorable man,\u201d Kelly told host Laura Ingraham. \u201cHe was a man that gave up his country to fight for his state, which 150 years ago was more important than country.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War,\u201d Kelly continued. \u201cAnd men and women of good faith on both sides made their stand where their conscience had them make their stand.\u201d\n\nThe comments drew widespread criticism from historians, pundits, and congressional and religious leaders. Among them was Hilary Shelton, head of the Washington, D.C., chapter of the NAACP, who called Kelly\u2019s historical revision \u201cdangerously simplistic,\u201d according to McClatchy DC Bureau. Shelton added that the NAACP would love to give White House officials a history lesson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), head of the Congressional Black Caucus, certainly thinks Kelly needs it.\n\n\u201cThe Civil War was not a disagreement between \u2018men and women of good faith on both sides,\u2019\u201d Richmond said, citing Kelly\u2019s own words. \u201cIt was a struggle for the soul of this country.\u201d\n\nSen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), the only black Republican in the Senate, also condemned Kelly\u2019s comments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe need to stop relitigating and referencing the Civil War as if there was some moral conundrum. There was no compromise to make\u2014only a choice between continuing slavery and ending it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Rev. William Barber, the former head of North Carolina\u2019s NAACP, called out Kelly\u2019s interpretation of the war as \u201ca lie.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompromise is what allowed slavery to exist in the first place. Revisionist history is dangerous,\u201d Barber said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso among the lawmakers calling out Kelly is Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.), the lawmaker Kelly attacked in a rare press briefing earlier in October.\n\n\n\nDuring his interview with Ingraham, Kelly said that he would \u201cnever\u201d apologize to Wilson about comments he made about her.\n\nWilson wrote in a tweet in the aftermath of Kelly\u2019s Civil War comments: \u201cWhat exactly, I wonder, would be the right \u2018compromise\u2019 between slavery and freedom for human beings?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at McClatchy DC Bureau.", "keywords": ["dc", "kellys", "civil", "comments", "black", "compromise", "slavery", "naacp", "dangerous", "blast", "kelly", "john", "head", "war", "leaders", "lawmakers"], "polarity": 0.09999999999999999, "subjectivity": 0.4818027210884354},

People who were familiar with the comics were buzzing about which iteration would be translated to the big screen and how he would fit in with other characters, such as Captain America and Iron Man. Then, in 2016, Captain America: Civil War was released into cinemas worldwide and audiences went wild, as did I.\n\nHere we had two black men who were representative of the richest and most advanced nation on Earth: the father\u2014T\u2019Chaka, the king\u2014and his son T\u2019Challa. As the plot of Civil War advanced and T\u2019Challa interacted with the other characters, one thing remained constant: T\u2019Challa was constantly shown respect and, in some instances, deference because of his position as a king. The only person who seemed to forget to whom she was speaking was Natasha, but she learned quickly enough to mind her manners. Yes, I cackled with petty glee when the Dora Milaje security chief told Natasha to \u201cmove or be moved.\u201d But I digress.\n\nAs time drew closer to the Black Panther premiere, Marvel released more trailers, and in one of the promotional featurettes that serve to give viewers insight into the world of Wakanda, I heard this: \u201cWakanda\u2019s walls have been up since its inception; it\u2019s the best-kept secret in the world because they have something the world wants.\u201d And a revelation took shape.\n\nWhen I heard it, a thought that had been sitting in the back of my mind came to the forefront: that Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) and Everett K. Ross\u2019 (Martin Freeman) intention to find a way into Wakanda and take its resources for themselves is exactly what Europeans did to Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the moment Europeans learned to sail the open seas, they did it with one goal in mind: Conquer foreign lands and seize control of whatever resources they could get their hands on. Who cared if there were established societies with their own systems of government? They invaded, pillaged and decimated entire countries and their indigenous people, without a care for the destruction left in their wake. And it seems that this is exactly what Klaue and Ross intend to do.\n\nThey don\u2019t care that Wakanda is a sovereign nation with a thriving society that wants to be left alone. Like the English and Portuguese of yore, all Ross and Klaue care about is their own selfish need to take what they consider to be Wakanda\u2019s most vital resource, vibranium.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the Ottoman Empire successfully prevented European travelers from making significant inroads into continental Africa, forcing them to settle for exploring the coastal regions of Western Africa, as the Portuguese did in the 1400s. Eventually the Portuguese, French, Dutch and British made their way into the African interior, but it wasn\u2019t without significant resistance from native tribes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor centuries, African nations have had to defend their right to exist because white people and nonblack people of color believed that black people were less than, and unsophisticated \u201csavages\u201d who needed ruling. But instead of finding uneducated beings, Europeans were quite surprised to find a continent that was rich in more than minerals such as gold. They found people who had created governments, trade that spanned the Eastern Hemisphere, kingdoms with grand palaces and, most important, knowledge.\n\n\n\nSimilarly to countries like Egypt and empires like the Ottoman, Wakanda is a land unlike anywhere else because it is developing technologies advanced far beyond what the world knows, and it\u2019s mostly because of a young black girl, Shuri, who is the head of technology as well as T\u2019Challa\u2019s sister. As everyone in the West looks to Tony Stark as a pinnacle of intelligence, Shuri is creating technology that would make Tony blush in shame. For goodness\u2019 sake\u2014Shuri made it so that T\u2019Challa\u2019s panther suit automatically recharges by absorbing the kinetic energy from striking bullets. Your angsty fave could neva.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a saying that goes, \u201cThe most disrespected person in the world is a black woman,\u201d so it\u2019s quite interesting that in the MCU, the most intelligent person is a black woman. This is significant because in our society, black women are constantly denigrated while the work we accomplish is co-opted; we are insulted for our looks and fashion while nonblack people copy them without shame. And since appropriation is a trend that never seems to go out of style, we have two white men seeking to steal Shuri\u2019s technology in order to claim it as their own and turn it into a bastardized version as a means to bring destruction for their own selfish gains.\n\nLike the early colonizers who saw black people as \u201cless than\u201d simply because their skin was dark, and their hair and facial features not like white people\u2019s, Klaue and Ross see the Wakandans as people they can walk over, shoot through and push aside, simply because they don\u2019t view black people as individuals with rights and ownership of their home.\n\nInstead of approaching T\u2019Challa in peace and friendship, Klaue and Ross conspire to enter Wakanda through subterfuge so that they can learn the secrets that King T\u2019Chaka and the elders have protected for a millennium.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut like the Portuguese, Ross and Klaue will learn that black people\u2014particularly black women\u2014will fight tooth and nail to protect what\u2019s theirs. In Wakanda, there is a resisting force of warriors known as the Dora Milaje, and like Queen Nzinga of Ndongo (now known as Angola) and the legendary female Dahomean army, the Dora Milaje, led by their general, Okoye, and aided by Shuri\u2019s technology, will do what they must to protect their king and kingdom against all invaders because they have no other choice.\n\nThe way I see it, black people have always had to fight to hold on to what is rightfully ours, not only our land but our very identities. It\u2019s as though being black equates to having to struggle, especially when colonization comes into play. Even though slavery was abolished in the Caribbean and North America over 150 years ago, the impact is still felt today and affects the African Diaspora in myriad ways. One of those ways is our understanding of who we are as a people and as individuals. By that I mean knowing where we literally come from.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom an early age I knew what slavery was. I was taught about colonialism and its effects not just on Africa but also on the Caribbean. We learned that Barbados, as the easternmost island in the Caribbean chain, was the first port of call for slave ships. It was on the island that some of the most devastating and insidious characteristics of colonization were revealed.\n\nOnce the ships landed in port, those held in captivity were made to accept European names, their hair shaved and tribalwear stripped away. In essence, their very identity, along with their freedom, was stolen. Over time they were made to be ashamed of what made them distinguishable not only as Africans but also as a tribal people.\n\nA prime example of this effect was in how the slaves dressed. Gone were the colorful robes and beaded collars that identified them as belonging to a specific tribe, as well as their marital status and even age. Instead, our ancestors had to wear stiff cotton and bleached muslin. The women could no longer wear the traditional and intricate hairstyles; instead, they were forced to cover their heads in plain cloth, leading to insecurities that affect us to this day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the civil rights movement in the 1960s and \u201970s created an emergence of pride in and appreciation for African culture and traditions, black people in the Western world still have to contend with ignorance of our heritage from people of all walks of life and ethnicities. How often are black women insulted for the way we wear our hair, while white women are praised for being \u201ctrendy\u201d? How many stories are there about black people being snubbed for wearing traditional African clothing, only to see white models strutting down catwalks in imitations while designers like Stella McCartney get applauded?\n\nThough I\u2019ve always been proud of being black and having African ancestry, I didn\u2019t realize how much I longed to see my heritage on-screen until one Sunday night in 2017. Marvel had released the Black Panther teaser trailer, and the world, the collective black community, was shaken to our very core. And we\u2014I\u2014haven\u2019t been the same since.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Wakanda, there are people wearing their traditional garb with pride. Characters like Erik Killmonger are covered in tribal scarification, and there\u2019s an elder adorned with a lip plate as worn by the Mursi people of Ethiopia.\n\n\n\nAs someone who loves everything about film, I\u2019ve always felt bereft at not seeing enough positive representations of black people or of Africa herself in mainstream media. So the power of seeing a film of this magnitude, with the backing of one of the world\u2019s biggest film studios, centered on black people living in an \u201cAfrican\u201d nation, untouched by the destructive hands of colonizers, cannot be overstated. In one moment I realized that we, black people, were being given a major piece of the proverbial pie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo have one of the major plots of Black Panther be about a black king, his army of black women and his black sister fighting against two would-be white invaders and their goons is what I would call poetic justice. I can\u2019t wait to see the colonizers and interlopers be beaten at a game they never had a chance of winning this time.

The portraits, by Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald respectively\u2014both black painters\u2014are such sharp departures from any previous depictions of a president and first lady that reviews were understandably mixed, even amongst our own crew here at The Root (including yours truly).\n\n\n\nEspecially when considering Mrs. Obama\u2019s portrait, it took a moment to reconcile her portrayal with our expectations. Where was the warmth we\u2019d become so accustomed to during the Obama era? The radiant smile? The glorious brown skin?\n\nWhile Wiley\u2019s portrait of our 44th President\u2019s portrait seemed lush and even playful\u2014if whimsically unconventional for a leader of the free world\u2014Sherald\u2019s portrait of his wife, posed similarly to Rodin\u2019s The Thinker, seemed to almost recede by comparison, like a cherished photograph that had already faded much too soon for our comfort. To some of us, it seemed more like a suggestion of our favorite first lady, rather than a portrait of the lady herself.\n\nAnd yet, in the days since\u2014for this writer, at least\u2014it has been difficult not to return to look at it again and again.\n\nAs Doreen St. Felix wrote in a wonderful analysis for the New Yorker:\n\nThe racializing schema of Sherald\u2019s work is to \u2018exclude the idea of color as race,\u2019 she has said, in her artist\u2019s statement. To Sherald, the photorealistic depiction of race\u2014a quality determined by others\u2019 eyes, externally\u2014is a dead end. Applied to Michelle Obama, the lack of brown in the skin feels first like a loss, and then like a real gain. This is a different Michelle, a woman evacuated of celebrity, who appears provisionally dreamlike, nearly a shadow. The mouth and the eyes and the strong arms that we know are present, but fainter. From some distance, I can imagine, the figure might not be immediately recognizable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf the many things that have been written about Mrs. Obama\u2019s portrait since its unveiling last Monday, several articles have focused on the dress she chose to be immortalized in, made by American (semi)affordable luxury label Milly, designed by Michelle Smith. Indeed, it is the most visually striking element of the portrait, featuring graphic-patterned patches in black, red, yellow, pink and beige, scattered across the white foreground of the skirt. It drapes across Mrs. Obama\u2019s lap in much the same way I remember quilts draping across my Mississippian great-grandmother\u2019s lap decades ago.\n\nMany have been quick to make the same comparison, especially noting similarities between Mrs. Obama\u2019s dress and the famously graphic geometric quilts created for over a century in Gee\u2019s Bend, Alabama. At the unveiling, artist Amy Sherald spoke to the similarities herself, saying:\n\nThe dress chosen for this painting was designed by Milly. It has an abstract pattern that reminded me of the Dutch artist Piet Mondrian\u2019s geometric paintings. But Milly\u2019s design also resembles the inspired quilt masterpieces made by the women of Gee\u2019s Bend, a small remote black community in Alabama where they compose quilts in geometries that transform clothes and fabric remnants into masterpieces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut designer Smith apparently had no such correlation in mind when she created the print. She spoke to Vogue about the dress, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s made of a stretch cotton poplin print in a clean, minimal, geometric print without a reference to anything past or nostalgic, which gives the dress a very forward-thinking sensibility\u2014this is very Michelle Obama.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut while Michelle Smith may not have read a metaphor for quilting in her own work, is it safe for her to assume that a woman as aware and astute as Michelle Obama\u2014well known for her strategic sartorial statements\u2014didn\u2019t? Aside from evoking the great American southern tradition of quilting\u2014as well as the stars and stripes famously handsewn for this country\u2014is it so outlandish to consider that her gown might also evoke the racial patchwork that comprises the country her husband so recently led?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo glean more insight, The Glow Up spoke with textile artist, clothing designer, children\u2019s book author and illustrator, and master quilter Cozbi Cabrera, a 2017 Lincoln Center artist-in-residence whose own quilts have been shown in the Myrtle Beach Art Museum, concurrent with an exhibit on the quilters of Gee\u2019s Bend. Like many others, she isn\u2019t so quick to discredit the correlation between the white American designer dress and the black American South.\n\nWell, I think for starters that designers have to be aware that they are influenced greatly, and that fashion overall is derivative. So, whether we are doing it consciously or subconsciously, there is something about putting all of these elements together that\u2019s going to strike a chord or trigger a memory or something. So, I think that she\u2019s probably not being\u2014I wouldn\u2019t even use the word \u2018truthful\u2019\u2014I think that she\u2019s probably not being aware of this idea that fashion is derivative. So, it comes from somewhere. And I think that rightfully so, [Amy Sherald\u2019s] notion of her choice is very telling as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCabrera is also quick to note the very \u201cAmerican story\u201d of Gee\u2019s Bend, an isolated peninsula about 35 miles southwest of Selma, Alabama, with a population of less than 300, according to the 2010 Census. Primarily African-American and reachable almost exclusively by ferry, in 1965, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. visited the enclave three weeks before Selma\u2019s \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d to encourage voter registration. However, three years before, Alabama\u2019s government had shut down ferry service to nearby Camden, further isolating the community from basic necessities like medical attention, employment, and participation in the democratic process.\n\nAnd yet, even in isolation, their traditions continued. In 2002, the Whitney Museum in New York mounted a show of the quilts of Gee\u2019s Bend, to rave reviews. The New York Times\u2019 art critic called them \u201ceye-poppingly gorgeous,\u201d while others marveled at the fact that these modernist creations could have generated within a place seemingly cut off from inspiration, as Cabrera notes:\n\n[T]heir quilts showed up at the Whitney Museum in New York, and the reviews came back that what they were doing rivaled anything that you\u2019d find in 20th-century art. ... how could it be? How could they have these sophisticated influences if they were in isolation? And it\u2019s almost like an assumption that the creator\u2014or what I would call the Divine\u2014sort of sprinkles sophistication and aesthetic instincts only on a particular group of people, in only a particular geographic location, you know?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilarly, Cabrera believes it may be short-sighted to underestimate the deep significance and skill in Sherald\u2019s portrait of Michelle Obama\u2014or to assume the former First Lady\u2019s intentions in choosing her for the commission. Because ultimately, isn\u2019t art\u2014like beauty\u2014in the eye of the beholder?\n\nI think that in a less masterful hand, most people have a tendency to kind of throw in the kitchen sink, and in my mind, [Sherald] made some very deliberate choices as to what to leave out and what was left was the likeness of Michelle Obama. So we got that it was her\u2014you know it was quite a bit of fluidity of line, and then these elements of patch. All that\u2019s left in my mind visually were the essentials to kind of like, tell the story. How [Milly designer Michelle Smith] might feel about that, I think it\u2019s almost not even relevant because I think that the larger community got what was being communicated. And so, I think that\u2019s why you keep hearing, again and again, this notion of [the] quilt. I think that there\u2019s a language that we all understand, and that\u2019s what you get with people groups; like the things that don\u2019t have to be spoken but are understood. ... It\u2019s not uncanny that the community is saying similar things along a similar vein, because we do have this common understanding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those of us whom, at first glance, might have wanted something more colorful and dramatic from our first black First Lady, perhaps it\u2019s worth taking a beat, and considering who Michelle Obama really is, as Cabrera\u2019s deft analysis reminds us:\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s the visual equivalent of a stage whisper, which draws more attention to itself.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["portrait", "dress", "black", "included", "bend", "picture", "gees", "quilts", "michelle", "lady", "obama", "think"], "polarity": 0.147996758631087, "subjectivity": 0.42747813960500525},

The money is still going to Harlem kids so that they can see the famed black superhero on the big screen, with the Boys & Girls Club of Harlem now being the recipient of the generous donation, as reflected in the GoFundMe, which has since been updated.\n\nAs was initially planned, the donations will go toward purchasing tickets and refreshments for the children and their chaperones.

Lots of stuff happened. Let\u2019s talk about it.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the VSB ATL meetup. First and foremost, thanks to everybody who came out. I met a ton of new and cool folks, even those folks who had allllll the hateration to share. I can\u2019t remember everybody\u2019s name, but like Tupac said to his mother, you are appreciated. Hopefully those who did come out made some new friends. I think I managed to speak to almost everybody (except that super shy person who dipped clean out without speaking to anybody but who showed up at the talk the next day), or my family did since I brought all of my sisters and even a long lost cousin to the fracas. Shouts to Hostile Negress (writing here as Dhiraj Naseen) who also came through to represent, represent. I enjoyed myself and I hope y\u2019all did too.\n\nLike I said, this trip started out as an opportunity for me to go speak to a class at Morehouse College and eventually morphed into a full day\u2019s worth of speaking engagements.\n\nMonday morning, and through the homie and Morehouse College professor and journalist, David Dennis, Jr., I had the opportunity to speak to his Advanced News Writing class about finding their voice and branding. Because Monday morning quarterbacking is a thing, I can think of how much better I could have done in that class room though I do think (and hope that) I at least gave them some things to think about. Oprah came up in the midst of the discussion and one of the students asked if I could play them the voicemail, so I did. I haven\u2019t listened to it since November, so it was pretty cool to listen to it anew after several months with folks hearing it for the first time. Shouts to David Dennis (who would also join me for the VSB talk later in the day), for opening his classroom up to me and having the distinction as being the person who allowed me to come back and speak at Morehouse College, something I actually have wanted to do.\n\nLittle did I know that God was like\u2026oh, you want this? You gon' learn today.\n\nThe week before last, and after I\u2019d already confirmed I was heading down and put in motion the pieces for the talk later Monday evening, I received a text from the homie Jamilah Lemieux (we all know who she is) asking if I would be interested in speaking at Morehouse for an endeavor she was helming using President\u2019s Day as a means to take a look at the legacy of Barack Obama, basically turning President\u2019s Day into Barack Obama Day with a day full of panels to be held on the 2nd floor of Morehouse\u2019s King Chapel. There were several panels, breakfast, lunch, free books, and a keynote address by Michael Eric Dyson. I was apart of a panel called \u201cFor The Culture: Obama and Pop Culture\u201d moderated by Jamilah where we discussed the effect of Obama\u2019s \u201ccool\u201d on accountability and how social media helped bolster him as a candidate for the kids, bro. My panel included awesome writer Rembert Browne and Hot 97\u2019s Deanii Scott, aka Scottiebeam. Shouts to my fellow panelists for an entertaining and engaging discussion. #yalldabess\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(There are lots of shouts in this piece recap. Also, clap for \u2018em all.)\n\nBut, I\u2019m really here to talk about the panel before mine. It was called \u201cBlack Men and the \u2018Obama Effect\u2019\u201d featuring some fairly prominent individuals in academia Morehouse College\u2019s Dr. David Wall Rice, Howard University\u2019s Dr. Greg Carr, writer and cultural commentator Mychal Denzel Smith, and entrepreneur and former Obama \u201cpastor in chief\u201d Joshua DuBois, who is a friend of mine.\n\nHear this and hear this good: That was the best panel I\u2019ve ever attended in my entire life. I\u2019ve had the pleasure of being on and attending panels for years now. I\u2019ve seen some terrible ones (mix of speakers and subject) and good ones (again, mix of speakers and subject), but this is the first time I\u2019ve ever attended a panel and didn\u2019t want it to end, never mind that I was on deck or that it was an hour and a half strong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBetween the questions that were asked, and the careful, thoughtful, and sometimes extremely dissenting opinions of the panelists, I can easily say that it was all things informative, insightful, entertaining, and worthwhile. The conversation that they were having \u2013 and it was nowhere near a table full of Obama advocates, shoot, it was possibly more \u201canti\u201d Obama than pro (I say anti, because nobody hates the man but the professors and Mychal were very reasonably critical of Obama\u2019s governance and the myth behind the man) \u2013 was useful and for all who attended, I\u2019m sure a delight. Everybody on the panel was in the know and able to articulate well their opinions, which isn\u2019t something you always get with these things.\n\nPoint is, it was Facebook Lived (it starts at the 1 hour mark on this video, my panel is also on this video at the end) and I\u2019d highly recommend that you check out the panel because it takes a whole lot for a panel discussion to impress me, but after this one, I made it a point to thank each and every one of them for the talk and even shouted them out during my own panel. Shouts to Jamilah and the entire crew from NewsOne for putting on such an edifying day full of talks. I\u2019m sure it was no easy task, but I think all who had the pleasure of attending, benefited.\n\nLastly, at 6pm at the Atlanta University Center\u2019s Robert W. Woodruff Library, affectionately referred to as Club Woody to all in the AUC (I\u2019m assuming they still call it that), I had the pleasure of doing a sit-down conversation about Black voices in a new America, alongside David Dennis. We had an engaged crowd who asked a bunch of questions, and we talked a lot, towards the end, about VSB\u2019s direction and goals, which I found interesting to actively talk about out loud. Typically, those are convos only Damon and I have. I heard I was a bit long-winded; that was probably true. But hopefully the discussion was interesting, and I try to throw in as many jokes as possible. Also, David has a great perspective as somebody who has been an active journalist for a long time and who has been recently dragged because of comments he made about Tom Brady, ending up on Breitbart and effectively had to talk about how to survive when this New America learns your name. It wasn't FB Lived because I'm Black and I forgot a TriPod, but ya know, we'll get 'em next time tiger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll in all in it was a great trip, and on the speaking end I\u2019m always learning and thinking of ways I could have improved what I said and how I said it, and I need a timer.

I was kindly escorted out of a Washington, D.C., club with R&B singer Christopher Williams, and heckled by El DeBarge and his entourage while performing in Anaheim, Calif. Raheem and I almost got into a full-on fistfight with members of the S.O.S. Band. I wish I were joking.\n\n\n\nThey haven\u2019t all been this crazy, though; I met some of my heroes, including Auntie Maxine, aka Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), so I\u2019m blessed. I get it. The others are just a few experiences I\u2019m not saving for my memoirs. But nothing would have ever led me to believe that I would be battle-rapping Dave Chappelle at Blues Alley in Washington, D.C., at 2:30 in the morning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s how it went down:\n\nDuring Congressional Black Caucus weekend in D.C., Dave Chappelle was in town doing a series of shows at the Warner Theatre. Raheem and I were back home in D.C. to speak and had just spoken on two panels during the CBC Foundation\u2019s Annual Legislative Conference, including a Hip-Hop for Justice conference that included such heavyweights as T.I., David Banner, Auntie Maxine and others.\n\nSo our final outing was scheduled for a Saturday night at the Renaissance Hotel, where Raheem was hosting a party and Biz Markie was deejaying. We get there and start taking shots of bourbon and Hennessy with Larenz Tate. The party is live. And then Dwayne Rawlings, a friend of many years and the brother of Donnell Rawlings, aka Ashy Larry, invites us to attend a private after-party at the legendary Blues Alley, hosted by Dave Chappelle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBackstory: We didn\u2019t know that Dave (yes, we\u2019re on a first-name basis) was hosting this celebrity-laced jam session after-party, but we find out that it\u2019s happening, so we are there.\n\nWe show up and immediately realize that this isn\u2019t a normal event. There is a strict no-cellphone policy, so there is no recording of any of this, and that makes it even more awesome. I spot Common, Anthony Anderson and Angela Rye when I walk in, and can you hear that noise? It\u2019s just me name-dropping.\n\nAnyway, Raheem and I post up next to the piano and observe the room. Dave calls Common up to the stage, and he kills it with a live band. Harmonica master Frederic Yonnet is playing and turning the J Dilla-laced tracks into a heavenly experience, and I take in the moment like the backwood I wish I had. I breath it in, then blow it out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCommon exits the stage, and Dave turns to the musicians and requests \u201cBetween the Sheets\u201d by the Isley Brothers before yelling out, \u201cAre there any singers in the room?\u201d\n\nAudience members start to point toward the piano where Raheem and I are standing. Raheem takes the stage and murders it. Dave takes the mic and resumes his hosting, clowning Raheem: \u201cWho is this nigga? I need to Google this nigga. Raheem Devaughn? Raheem Divine?\u201d\n\nHe turns to the band and asks for \u201cTake a Walk on the Wild Side,\u201d and the band looks puzzled. I shout, \u201cCan I Kick It,\u201d and the band nods in acknowledgment and breaks into song.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe asks for rappers, and I step on the stage and start freestyling over the beat:\n\nI was born in N.E. DC\n\nRound the corner from Seat Pleasant, P.G.\n\nUp the street was the quadrant of S.E.\n\nLincoln Heights and Clay Terrace taught me bout beef\n\nPlayed ball on Drew and Watts courts\n\nNever joined the drug game but I got sport\n\nWho thought 58th was cooking up art\n\nWhile the rest of them dudes was cooking up rocks\n\nLike C. Delores Tucker, Dave steamrolls over my verse and cuts me off. He starts questioning, \u201cWho is this nigga? Who is he?\u201d then proceeds to spit his rap. He spits a few lines about D.C., but I didn\u2019t really hear him because of the shock that the lines I did hear showed he was coming for me. Dave Chappelle was literally battle-rapping against me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI looked at Raheem, who gave me the nod to \u201cgo in.\u201d\n\nI humbly retorted: \u201cNo disrespect, but you don\u2019t know me, but nigga I\u2019m not from Maryland, I\u2019m actually from D.C. I don\u2019t swing on celebrity balls. I\u2019m a real MC. I make crowds yell, \u2018Yes, Yes Y\u2019all.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nDave responded with a few more jabs.\n\nI never got a second response. Ashy Larry suddenly jumped onstage and took the mic and began to spit a comedic verse. We\u2019d become a part of Chappelle\u2019s Show and this was a scene change. The end of a skit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the spirit of the moment, Raheem and I began to chant a chorus from our Footprints on the Moon album: \u201cYou deserve the world my Negus, It\u2019s never too soon my Negus, For Footprints on the Moon my Negus.\u201d\n\nDave bobbed his head with a grin. Common jumped back onstage, and Raheem and I fell back and provided supporting vocals while he breezed through some of his hits like \u201cGo.\u201d\n\nI was proud of black people on this night. I was loving my black. Instead of breaking each other down in verse, we used the platform to showcase our skills. Sometimes you have to take a knee in order to stand up for your brothers. You can either build or destroy, and black men need to build one another up in all arenas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe evening ended; we walked through the crowd. And although I still didn\u2019t have my backwood, I was high. It was a blessing to be onstage on this night with this group of black people in this once-all-black city.\n\nSometimes real life is better than art, and on this night, for this moment, Shakespeare couldn\u2019t have written it better.\n\nNative Washingtonian.

That is how long I\u2019ve been sick with an unknown virus (the thing doctors tell you when they don\u2019t know what it is but know it won\u2019t kill you). It\u2019s not the flu. It\u2019s not a cold. But it is one thing\u2014a jerk. Just the biggest jerk of a disease ruining my social life by forcing me to be actually antisocial, much like the name of this column.\n\nAntisocial is the events-and-society column for people allergic to society, aka those with social anxiety disorder, so it\u2019s not as if I needed an actual disease to give me a reason to stay home. I come up with plenty of excuses to stay in the house\u2014it\u2019s too hot, it\u2019s too cold, it\u2019s too \u201coutside\u201d\u2014whatever works. But I had actually been looking forward to the spate of events I had lined up over the last two weeks to crash. Page Six TV\u2019s party. A YouTube-Elle Magazine function. So many Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Annual Legislative Conference panels and events in Washington, D.C. All missed because I was too busy hacking and coughing in my prison of used Kleenex.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is my first time being ill in more than two years, ruining my pristine streak of good health, all of which was fueled (mostly) by a flu shot I took back in 2015 and some really good luck, considering that New York City is a germophobe\u2019s nightmare fuel. I\u2019m supposed to travel back to D.C. later this week for my 40th birthday, but the way this sickness is going, who knows what will happen come Friday? Can I even travel? I could\u2019ve almost died in my hotel room during CBC week because I choked on a cold tablet that got lodged in my throat.\n\n\n\nIn the middle of my more than 18 days of sinus infection, I decided to take a break from being sick and pretended to be well because I didn\u2019t want to miss the Black & White Champagne Brunch with the New York Urban League at La Marina in New York City on Sept. 16.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout 200 people gathered for the brunch, which was hosted by actress and body-positive advocate RaVal Davis. Charter Communications Vice President of State Government Affairs Camile Joseph Goldman was being honored with the David N. Dinkins Award for Service, Leadership and Social Justice at the event, which also featured performances by NAACP Theater Award-winning actress and singer Sha\u2019Leah Nikole.\n\nShe performed Roberta Flack\u2019s classic by way of the Fugees, \u201cKilling Me Softly,\u201d as I ate eggs and bacon, feeling proud of my ability to actually throw together a halfway decent outfit that didn\u2019t make me feel that I unnecessarily stood out in a bad way, but still blended in with the overall theme of everyone in black and white.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRemarks were made by NYUL President and CEO Arva R. Rice and Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.), as well as Goldman, who gave a spirited and impassioned speech.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was mostly thankful that it wasn\u2019t a dreaded \u201cwhite party\u201d (black people love white parties, where you dress in all white, get turnt and look like drunken angels), because I hate wearing all white with a passion. The absence of color does nothing for my complexion and is almost as dreaded as wearing all black, which makes me look like I (still) work at Macy\u2019s.\n\n\n\nPer usual, I had no business cards on me because they were still in the mail at the time and my old cards were lost more than a year ago in my move to New York City. (They did show up in time for CBC week, meaning that a bunch of people now have my work number, filling me with a special kind of anxiety.)\n\nThis made me garner a look from New York society columnist Audrey J. Bernard, whom I\u2019d watched chastise a young woman who approached me a few weeks ago at a New York Fashion Week event wanting to write for The Root and had no business cards. To be honest, I find that when I receive business cards, I never do absolutely anything with them unless the person is someone I\u2019m desperately, constantly forgetting the name of. Then I hold on to the card as if I\u2019m hoping the name will be absorbed into my porous brain.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m notoriously bad with names. Chances are, if you know me and I know you but we\u2019re not close enough to be besties, I don\u2019t actually know your name even though I\u2019ve met you several times, seen you at multiple events and recognize you easily. I used to have a publisher, Virginia Moorhouse\u2014whose family owns the Bakersfield Californian newspaper, where I worked for five years\u2014who was fantastic at remembering everyone\u2019s name, an incredible, enviable skill.\n\nI try all the tricks, repeating the name back to them, introducing them to friends so they have to say their name\u2014nothing really works except for this one time when I ran into a guy (who also probably didn\u2019t know my name, either, to be honest) in the airport and I remembered his entire life story but not his name, so I went home and furiously Googled his job and searched for his name and picture until it popped up, then just kept walking around my apartment, repeating the name back to myself like a lunatic.\n\nWhich brings me to CBC in Washington, where I was talking to Very Smart Brothas\u2019 Panama Jackson, a senior editor here at The Root, and he was also complaining about how he knew no one\u2019s name. How he would know people, kick it with people at parties and still have no idea what they\u2019re called. He wondered if something was wrong with him or if he was just self-centered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI told him I was the same way and that he was likely just self-centered, since I\u2019m sure that is my issue. I\u2019m often too busy thinking about whatever the personal malady of the day is to know what anyone\u2019s name is, lost in my own head. I may be present with you in the moment, talking, smiling, laughing, but am I really there? Or am I lost in my own head, wondering about this and that? It\u2019s annoying and probably one of my least favorite things about myself. I want to be in the moment, but I\u2019m easily distracted by my own internal drama.\n\nEvery year for the past 47 years, the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation has thrown a conference in D.C. that attracts thousands of black people from across the nation to talk policy and community issues, then fight to get into many of the exclusive parties going on around the main event. I was too sick for most of the conference, barely making it through panels\u2014faring poorly with a panel The Root\u2019s Jason Johnson and Panama were on about the importance of the black press, but faring a bit better during a panel on the film Black Panther that featured director Ryan Coogler and an exclusive five-minute clip from the film.\n\nI spent most of the conference just trying not to die, but managed to pull it together for a discussion between St. Louis\u2019 own, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) (she\u2019s from Kinloch, Mo., to be precise), and BET\u2019s newest late-night talk show host, Robin Thede, soon to be starring in The Rundown With Robin Thede.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was excited to attend this event and to meet Robin because we have something in common: We were both black-lady head writers for late-night talk shows\u2014she is formerly of Larry Wilmore\u2019s show on Comedy Central, and I am formerly of BET\u2019s previous late-night outing Don\u2019t Sleep Hosted by T.J. Holmes.\n\nMy foray into late-night TV was very (very!) short-lived. The show lasted only four months back in 2012. T.J. has since moved on to Good Morning America on ABC, and I\u2019m obviously here at The Root, holding it down. I wished Robin all the best with her show (and told her I\u2019d love to do a feature on her for The Root), and judging by how well she handled her interview with Waters\u2014it was funny and insightful\u2014I have a feeling she might last much, much longer than our four months of ratings-based struggle! (But we did get this sweet write-up in the New York Times!)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for all the other activities that happened during CBC, I left all of those for everyone else to enjoy, since I spent nearly every night in my hotel room quietly wondering why I traveled to D.C. while sick on a germ-filled Amtrak train, resickening myself and making my illness worse. I left all the real partying to my friend Jason, who did all the things I would have done had I been well\u2014like be bold enough to crash parties I wasn\u2019t invited to in order to see T.I. and Babyface perform at separate galas. I ended up giving away my ticket to the coveted Black Party (hosted by La La Anthony and featuring Doug E. Fresh) to my best friend, Jada Prather, so I could go back to my hotel and die.\n\nSpeaking of dying, I almost did! The following morning, I attempted to take some cold medication and choked on the pill. It got caught up in my throat and would NOT dislodge despite all the coughing, hacking and vomiting I did. Fearing that I would die, I called the front desk and attempted to tell them, \u201cSend help, I\u2019m choking!\u201d For some reason, they misinterpreted this but did send up a gentleman who, upon looking at me hacking and coughing with mucus running from my nose, took off running in the other direction, shouting on his walkie-talkie to the front desk. I was hoping he\u2019d help me out with a Heimlich or something, but no.\n\nSo I was left gagging and contemplating whether this was the end. That the sum of my life would conclude with me asphyxiating on a very large DayQuil gel cap, in a T-shirt and underwear, in a hotel room in D.C. All I kept thinking was, \u201cThis is a stupid, stupid way to die.\u201d I also thought a lot about the HBO show Six Feet Under, which had an episode once in which a woman choked to death on food in her apartment, and how I always feared this happening to me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo I thought about dying, my father, Six Feet Under and how dumb this was. A dumb way to die. I couldn\u2019t die like this. I had to calm down and attempt to breath through all the coughing and heaving so I wouldn\u2019t black out.\n\nAfter what felt like forever, the pill started to break down and dissolve in my throat, probably from all the vomiting of stomach acid (it was very early in the morning and I hadn\u2019t eaten yet). The hotel sent several more people up to my room to check on me, including the paramedics, who had been told that someone \u201cfell.\u201d I was like, \u201cNah, I was choking.\u201d So the paramedics cracked a few jokes and left.\n\nAfter everyone determined that no one had died at the Hyatt Place in \u201cNoMa\u201d (lol at that name), I was left to my own devices, whereupon I sat in my room and cried until Jason called me and invited me to breakfast, where I recounted to him my brush with death in a hoarse voice that could barely get out words.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere, I ate this Breakfast Bandit bagel sandwich at Buffalo & Bergen in Union Market.\n\nIt was delicious, but I was still teary and miserable, and I wanted to document the first thing I attempted to eat after almost dying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeemed important.\n\nThankfully, I am not dead, but still on the mend from my illness. I have a whole spate of events lined up in October that I will hopefully be much more healthy and present for. Hopefully. Maybe. Perhaps.

She also was the judge in the criminal case involving Lewis \u201cScooter\u201d Libby, the George W. Bush White House aide who got 30 months in prison for leaking the name of CIA agent Valerie Plume.\n\nIn the district, Robinson also oversaw cases involving former D.C. Mayor Marion Barry, notorious drug kingpin Rayful Edmond III and even an assault case against then-Philadelphia 76ers star Allen Iverson, who was sued for assault. Robinson denied Iverson\u2019s request to give his testimony in Philadelphia instead of Washington, D.C., reports Bustle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven Donald Trump\u2019s disdain for both judges (see Gonzalo Curiel and any other judge who has actually upholds the Constitution) and for black women (see Jemele Hill, Rep. Frederica Wilson, Omarosa Manigault Newman\u2019s marginalization, etc.), it\u2019s almost a guarantee that Robinson will be in the bull\u2019s eye.\n\nBut we ain\u2019t down for the bullshit.\n\nRead more at Bustle.", "keywords": ["robinson", "bs", "watch", "black", "trumps", "university", "manafort", "washington", "case", "hear", "judge", "woman", "deborah", "cases", "president", "son"], "polarity": 0.014510006901311257, "subjectivity": 0.4066425120772947},

Val Demmings (from Florida\u2019s 10th District) on the upcoming Marvel film Black Panther and STEM (science, technology, engineering or math) fields.\n\nMost first-term congressional members go for a safe, easy panel on the environment, maybe find a B-level political pundit or celebrity to talk about health care, or slam Donald Trump. But Demmings went big.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t say yes if you don\u2019t ask,\u201d she said, smiling when discussing how she put her panel together.\n\nDemmings used her connections with Disney (the Disney World Orlando theme park is located in the 10th District) to put on a panel called \u201cImagining a Bigger World\u2014Marvel\u2019s Black Panther, Cultural Heritage and STEM,\u201d which premiered five minutes of exclusive footage from the upcoming Black Panther movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, THAT Black Panther movie. The one with the trailer that broke the internet. The one with every single black actor in Hollywood not already cast on BET or TV One. The one directed by Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station, Creed), who is the most recognizable brother out of Oakland, Calif., not named Marshawn Lynch.\n\nWe saw the trailer. We laughed, we cried, we tried to make a time machine to get to February faster, and now we\u2019re sharing what we saw with you.\n\nWhile other people lined up for panel discussions about how to battle HIV in the Trump era or juvenile-justice reform, about 150 or so people lined up quietly, then filed into a small lecture hall to catch a glimpse of an imaginary African country that is about to completely transform Marvel superhero movies and Hollywood in general.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile some of the footage had been shown during Comicon this summer, this was the first time Black Panther footage would be seen by a 95 percent black audience. It was like a test screening for a movie we\u2019d already bought tickets for in our heads.\n\nModerator Jay Harris of ESPN introduced the star-studded panel, including director Coogler; actress Danai Gurira (The Walking Dead); Belinda Frazier, head of diversity and outreach at Disney; Nate Moore, the film\u2019s executive producer; and Rick Loverd, the director of Science and Entertainment Exchange at the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nSeriously, this was like the fantasy version of a black science-and-comic-nerd panel. After somberly reading the \u201cYou better not pirate this clip or Disney will hunt you down and everyone you\u2019ve ever loved\u201d speech, the lights were dimmed and the footage came up on-screen. Here are the highlights:\n\nThe trailer opens with King T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman) in a black tailored suit walking into a red-carpeted casino with a Dora Milaje (the special all-female Wakandan royal security force) on each arm\u2014Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) and Okoye (Danai Gurira). They\u2019re scoping out the place, talking through hidden microphones, looking for mercenary Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKlaue arrives with about 10 goons and starts bragging about what\u2019s in his pants (literally) and trying to negotiate a deal with Agent Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman) for a briefcase holding a small sample of an ore called vibranium. One of his goons notices the Dora Milaje, the deal goes bad, bullets start flying, and everybody was kung fu fighting.\n\nThe action is kinetic, like a mixture of Coogler\u2019s fight scenes from Creed and the manic bullet ballets from Kingsman movies. Okoye and Nakia pull out spears and start fighting off henchmen, and T\u2019Challa is diving over tables while Klaue is shooting at Ross, T\u2019Challa and everyone else to make his escape. T\u2019Challa effortlessly makes a 20-foot leap into the upper balcony to chase after Klaue, only to have to dodge a slew of lasers as Klaue\u2019s hand transforms into a cannon of some kind. Then the scene ends.\n\nIn the next scene, T\u2019Challa is seen running through brightly lit city streets chasing an SUV. As he runs, his formal casino wear morphs around his body, seamlessly changing him into the Black Panther costume.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Panther jumps on top of the fleeing SUV while you see Okoye pull out a gigantic golden spear and throw it in front of the vehicle, where it props up like a light post. The car smashes full speed into the spear. The spear holds its ground as the car flips over, and as it does, you see Black Panther leap from the top of the roof of the car, onto a nearby building, where he begins to run up the side\u2014like Spider-Man, but with better coordination.\n\nNext you see Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) and T\u2019Challa prepare to battle in the sacred falls that have been shown in previous trailers. It\u2019s clear that in the movie, King T\u2019Challa will be challenged several times for leadership of Wakanda in ritual combat.\n\nAs T\u2019Challa and Killmonger square off, you see a red battle suit similar to Black Panther\u2019s form around Killmonger, and he leaps at the king. They fight, kicking, punching and swinging, before falling off a waterfall together, fighting all the way down into the cloudy waters below.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn what appears to be another leadership challenge, M\u2019Baku (Winston Duke), the leader of the White Gorilla Cult, steps out of a cave into the sacred lake to battle T\u2019Challa. He\u2019s much larger than Wakanda\u2019s king and wears a large mask that resembles an ape.\n\nAfter that, there are a series of quick scenes showing Black Panther dropping out of a airplane, a secret lab full of weapons and Black Panther suits being tested, more butt-kicking, and Michael B. Jordan scowling at T\u2019Challa.\n\nWhen the trailer ended, the room cheered, once we stopped wiping tears of absolute joy from our eyes. The panel seemed legitimately thrilled with their work: Gurira smiled like a kid who knows she\u2019s going to win the science fair, and Coogler was amped to answer questions.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn audience member asked how technology derived from vibranium\u2014the rare ore found only in Wakanda that is part of everything from Captain America\u2019s shield to Ultron\u2019s robot army\u2014played a role in how they set up the film. Coogler compared Wakanda\u2019s relationship with vibranium to the Congo\u2019s relationship with the mineral coltan in the real world.\n\nMost people don\u2019t realize, but coltan is one of the most vital minerals on planet Earth. Due to its unique properties, coltan is in every cellphone, electric car and missile-guidance system in the world, and it\u2019s pretty much only found in the Congo.\n\nThe Congo has been attacked, colonized and renamed several times over the years, but imagine if that didn\u2019t happen? Imagine if the Congolese discovered and capitalized on coltan technology, and managed to fight off Western colonization. How might that nation have evolved? Just how powerful would it have become?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the story of Wakanda, with super-smooth black royal superheroes thrown into the mix.\n\n\u201cWe asked ourselves, did the vibranium make Wakandans special, or were Wakandans already something special and made something of vibranium? We decided it was the Wakandans,\u201d said Coogler.\n\n\n\nPanelists talked about everything from vibranium\u2019s impact on Wakandan aeronautics to the cultural importance of seeing a movie about black people running a black country for little black children all over the world. (Black Panther will actually have a cross-nation release on the African continent, in addition to opening in the United States, a first for Disney films.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be what you can\u2019t see,\u201d remarked panelist Rick Loverd, who pointed out that in the years after the Hunger Games films and Pixar\u2019s release of Brave, there was a 50 percent increase in girls signing up for archery classes.\n\nHe said he believes that Black Panther will spark interest in science and tech as well as travel to Africa in a whole generation of black Americans who\u2019ve never seen this kind of rich cultural depiction before.\n\nEverything about this movie screams international adventure, action and cultural resonance that few Marvel movies, if not movies, period, have ever accomplished.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you can\u2019t wait till February to get your Black Panther experience going, don\u2019t worry.

The report says it also found evidence that Johnson bravely fought against ISIS\u2019 agents until the end.\n\nAccording to AP:\n\n[T]he report has determined that [Johnson] was killed by enemy rifle and machine gun fire as he fled the attack by an offshoot of the Islamic State group about 120 miles north of Niamey, the capital of the African country. The attack took place Oct. 4; Johnson\u2019s body was recovered two days later.\n\nThe officials familiar with the investigation said that Johnson was hit as many as 18 times from a distance by a volley of machine-gun rounds from M4 rifles and that he was returning fire as he and two Nigerien soldiers tried to escape. This evidence refutes reports that he was shot at close range or had been bound or taken prisoner and executed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAP reports:\n\nThe report concluded that Johnson, who was athletic and a runner, was in the lead and got the farthest away, seeking cover in the brush.

Originally based on supermodels Naomi Campbell and Tyra Banks, the Dora were initially conceived not only as female warriors but also as potential wives for the king, whom they\u2019ve pledged to protect, along with the royal family. They were the best and strongest women from the 18 villages within Wakanda and trained at the royal palace.\n\nBut while Priest may in part cite supermodels as his inspiration, there is a historical prototype for the Dora Milaje in the Dahomey \u201cAmazons\u201d\u2014so nicknamed by European colonizers and now known by the French-speaking Beninese as the \u201cN\u2019Nonmiton\u201d (which translates to \u201cour mothers\u201d in Fon).\n\nCreated by King Agaja of the West African nation of Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) in the 18th century, the N\u2019Nonmiton were an all-female guard and fighting force, likely inspired by the female hunters known as gbeto. Like the Dora Milaje, the N\u2019Nonmiton were also considered wives of the king, pledging celibacy as well as loyalty and protection to him. And they existed in this role until the colonization of Dahomey in the late 19th century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can learn all about the incredible female warriors of Dahomey in a 2015 episode of the podcast Stuff You Missed in History Class, and in a very comprehensive comic on their history created by UNESCO for its Series on Women in African History (pdf).

It all starts Wednesday.\n\n\n\nIn the past, CBC annual events were a time of black celebration\u2014and education. They were essentially a gathering of black excellence; workshops and serious policy talk in the front, and bougie, black line-dancing in the back. For every panel on \u201cThe Danger of Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the Era of the Trump Administration\u201d is a raised glass of Remy in tribute to the fact that Cardi B no longer dances but can make money move.\n\nThe CBCs of the past have essentially been the grown-up cotillions for Jack and Jill parents, policy wonks and politicos. Oh, how we all long for the free-flowing Obama years in which the tradition of trying to find the popping party was all to be worried about. But, my, how times have changed.\n\nIn the depressing Republican Trumpian movie that has become our now, the clouds have rolled in, the thunder has cracked and the ominous sounds of a broken cello play off in the distance. This year\u2019s CBC conference is the first under a would-be dictator\u2019s regime that\u2019s changed the unspoken mantra of \u201cthe party with a purpose\u201d feel of CBCs past into a \u201cpurpose, and maybe a few parties\u201d of the present.\n\nC.J. Epps, vice president of marketing and communications for the CBCF, assures me that the foundation\u2019s mission hasn\u2019t changed despite the gloomy darkness surrounding the Trump administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe mission of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Inc. is to advance the global black community by developing leaders, informing policy and educating the public,\u201d Epps told The Root. \u201cActually, our position and commitment to our mission hasn\u2019t changed at all. We are dedicated to it now more than ever. If anything, we are more vigilant in our efforts. This is why this year\u2019s Annual Legislative Conference is so important. The 47th ALC comes at a pivotal time for us all.\u201d\n\nThis is a unique time for a gathering of black elite. Currently, America is seemingly teetering on the edge of a race war. Unarmed black bodies are still falling in the streets, and cops are still walking free with their pensions intact. Protests are currently raging in St. Louis after a white cop was found not guilty in the death of an unarmed black man. And, at the time of this post, President Donald Trump has yet to even acknowledge that any of this is happening.\n\nCongress passed legislation demanding that he speak out against racist hate groups. While Trump has been apt to vomit all over Twitter, he\u2019s had trouble calling white male hate by its name. This might arguably be the most divisive, xenophobic, hate-filled administration for which there\u2019s an actual fact-filled argument that the president of the United States not only emboldens white supremacy but actually abides by white supremacist beliefs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo the assembly of some of black America\u2019s finest in the nation\u2019s capital isn\u2019t just a moment to show up and show out; it\u2019s a chance to capture some of the concrete thinking on how to handle a bumbling administration that has made at least this one point clear: It doesn\u2019t care about us. Not even a lil bit.\n\n\u201cThis year we have to come together as a community, and as a country, to work together,\u201d Epps said. \u201cOur forums and sessions will focus on civic engagement, civil rights, foreign affairs, national security, and our core pillars\u2014education, health and wellness, economic empowerment and the environment.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, this year at the ALC, we will bring attention to the continued need for social and economic sustainability in the African-American community,\u201d Epps added. \u201cGiven the recent events in Charlottesville, St. Louis and other events, the time is now to discuss these issues and come up with effective policy solutions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEpps continued: \u201cWhile we all enjoy having a good time, while we are all gathered, and we will have a number of notable[s] in attendance, this year\u2019s theme, \u2018And Still I Rise,\u2019 recognizes the impact and legacy of resilience needed to rise above continued racial inequalities faced by African-American communities. This year, we certainly have a lot to critically examine, and to celebrate, with that in mind.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo, maybe this year, we collectively agree to drink a little less, dance a little softer and attend more than one panel so that we can get back to the business of tearing down the administration that racism built.\n\n\u201cI do believe that this year, more than any other year, we will have critical discussions on a myriad of social, economic and policy issues, all happening simultaneously, and all real and relevant to African Americans and the global black Diaspora,\u201d Epps said. \u201cThe conference is absolutely needed, this year and beyond.

I still don\u2019t think I\u2019ve fully processed or fully understand what impact this movie is going to have on people\u2019s lives. So I\u2019m excited.\u201d \u2014Douriean\n\nJewelry designer and metalsmith Douriean Fletcher\u2014who designs and retails simply as Douriean\u2014is having the kind of breakthrough moment most artists can\u2019t even begin to dream of. Handpicked by friend and legendary costume designer Ruth E. Carter to join the costume team of Black Panther (the two previously worked together on 2016\u2019s Roots), Douriean\u2019s handcrafted jewelry and metalwork adorn the citizens and royalty of Wakanda\u2014perhaps most dazzlingly as the armor and neckpieces of the incredible warrior women of the Dora Milaje.\n\nWatching her own work in action was a thrilling experience, as Douriean told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nSeeing the movie, it was an absolute joy to see this glistening armor just pop off the screen. ... These Dora characters are the first defense of Wakanda; they\u2019re the ones that defend the honor and the safety of the country. So I think I didn\u2019t really fully process what that meant\u2014that I was creating those pieces\u2014until I saw the movie the other day. The actual craftsmanship of those pieces was a very interesting yet challenging experience ... these pieces have a meaning. They have a specific meaning of who these women are, and what they do for their country. They\u2019re there to be resilient and strong, and to protect Wakanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m inspired and intrigued by how we choose to represent ourselves as resilient and beautiful and functional, regardless of what we\u2019ve experienced in life.\u201d\n\nDouriean\u2019s handmade, often hand-hammered aesthetic was a perfect match for this newest cinematic corner of the Marvel Universe, which introduces us to the technologically advanced, culturally rich fictional African nation of Wakanda. Douriean, who considers her work not only Afrofuturistic but \u201cAncient Futuristic\u201d or \u201cPrimal Chic,\u201d welcomed the challenge to translate her artistic aesthetic to the big screen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDouriean explained:\n\nI feel like I have a lot of responsibility, first off, to communicate a certain message through my work. I feel like it\u2019s a lot of responsibility, but I think it\u2019s a great position to be in. ... But I think as far as the Marvel Universe, it\u2019s a perfect match because I was able to bring something different to this culture of Wakanda, this fictional country that they had yet to really tap into.\n\nCostume designer Carter agreed, telling The Glow Up that she\u2019d specifically chosen Douriean because she felt strongly that the metal pieces used in Black Panther had to have a \u201chand-tooled African, hand-hammered\u201d aesthetic. That, coupled with director Ryan Coogler\u2019s desire for even the armor to look like beautiful African jewelry, made Douriean the ideal choice. The jewelry designer confessed to us that initially, she held back in deference to the Marvel aesthetic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[Ruth E. Carter] said, \u2018This isn\u2019t Douriean enough. You have to put more of yourself in it.\u2019 That was exciting. Like, oh, wait, you\u2019re giving me some space to do my thing,\u201d Douriean said.\n\nA Pasadena, Calif., native, Douriean has been creating jewelry since 2010. She is mostly self-taught, save for a three-month metalsmithing class in New Orleans. Having traveled throughout Tanzania and South Africa and now based in Los Angeles, she makes work that \u201cexplores cultural identity, femininity, spirituality and divine power.\u201d When asked where she gleans her inspiration, she told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nSometimes it\u2019s my story; if I experience something that\u2019s quite challenging, I\u2019ll take inspiration from that\u2014and, sometimes, motivation from those experiences\u2014and put that into a piece. Sometimes I literally just have dreams, and I wake up in the middle of night and sketch them out. And sometimes other people\u2019s stories, or just their essence ... women, we\u2019re very multifaceted creatures. So I\u2019m inspired and intrigued by how we choose to represent ourselves as resilient and beautiful and functional, regardless of what we\u2019ve experienced in life. ... The physique of a woman is very beautiful, and I want\u2014whenever I create something\u2014to be able to adorn someone to where they feel regal and beautiful and powerful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a female metalsmith, Douriean admitted that her eight-year journey has been a challenge, as there aren\u2019t many women in the field, let alone black women. But she credits the obstacles with her growth as an artist and innovator:\n\n\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve been underestimated at times; people are just surprised that I can create what I do, or doubt that I can create what I make. And because it\u2019s so different from what people think when they think of jewelry-making, it\u2019s been a challenge to find my niche and my clientele. Like this whole entire process, like this is the first time\u2014these past two years\u2014where I feel like I\u2019ve finally found my tribe and my clientele of people who can understand and accept my work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith that growth and increasing exposure have come major shifts for Douriean, especially as the officially licensed jewelry designer for both Black Panther and the upcoming Avengers film, which promises to be an even larger production. While creating for mass market raises her exposure and reach, it definitely presented challenges to her typically one-of-a-kind approach to design. According to Douriean:\n\nAs an artist, I like to create one-offs\u2014I like to create one thing, it has a story to it, it means something and it\u2019s for one particular person. To be able to have to expand that, and create a narrative for a group of people, it\u2019s a different way of approaching my work. So, for instance, the Black Panther line ... I created that, number one, for the comic book fan; the young men and women or the young boys and girls who grew up on the comics, who are super excited, who have been waiting for this moment for years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those of us coveting a piece of Black Panther to take home, the sterling silver Black Panther collection is currently available on Douriean\u2019s website. A collection inspired by Panther villain Killmonger is next, and lastly, a collection inspired by the Dora Milaje, which Douriean will handcraft herself.\n\nThe Glow Up caught a preview of both Lupita Nyong\u2019o and the designer herself at the Marvel Studios Black Panther Welcome to Wakanda New York Fashion Week presentation on Monday. Frankly, we can\u2019t wait to see if 24-karat-gold neck rings and epaulets are in our futures. The designer was coy:\n\n\u201cI wanted the Dora pieces to be very special, so I\u2019m handcrafting all of those. So it\u2019s coming. It\u2019s coming,\u201d she told us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut right now, Douriean is just savoring the moment and trying to process how it feels to become part of cinematic history:", "keywords": ["douriean", "panther", "black", "create", "adorned", "feel", "designer", "work", "jeweler", "jewelry", "heavy", "women", "armored", "metal", "think"], "polarity": 0.2566777954749653, "subjectivity": 0.5426845952789348},

They\u2019re there to talk policy. They\u2019re there to network. But just as big as the networking and policy wonking is the partying. So much partying.\n\nD.C. has always been a fun city to throw a shindig, and the ALC has always been a highly anticipated event, but under the Barack Obama administration, there was an extra layer of cool added to the typical shenanigans. Traditional D.C. affairs became must-see events that you hustled to get into. Even ol\u2019 \u201cnerd prom,\u201d the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner, became a place where Kardashians and other celebrities played. This was no different for the ALC, where you were as likely to see California Rep. Maxine Waters as you were the cast of Starz\u2019s hit show Power.\n\nFor eight years, that cool, fostered by President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, who were mainstays at the annual conference and its events, was evident in everything, but to quote 112, \u201cIt\u2019s over now.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump has attempted to wreak havoc on Obama\u2019s legacy and America in general. The world\u2019s pettiest world leader has taken aim at targets big and small, casting a cloud over, well, pretty much everything he thinks about. Trump is a wet towel placed upon good and joyous feelings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we are a joyous people. While it\u2019s probably right to expect that Trump and his assailant policies will be a regular and common occurrence during the panels, talks and discussions all up and through the ALC, will it have an impact on the social scene and atmosphere? I asked a few people engaged in the scene for their impressions as individuals who are active attendants, hosts and curators of experiences. I was particularly curious to know if the anticipation for events and the like had dulled in any way.\n\nDemetria Lucas D\u2019Oyley, author of the book Don\u2019t Waste Your Pretty, who is moderating a panel during ALC week titled \u201cOwning It: Being a Media Mogul,\u201d says: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a decrease in the number of invites to social events, or corporate sponsors hosting events. Amongst my circle, anticipation for CBC ALC is as high as ever. It\u2019s a \u2018homecoming\u2019 of sorts for the political set.\u201d\n\nIn fact, while a spokesperson for the Fab Empire, who curates the Insider\u2019s Guide, told us that they\u2019ve heard grumblings that people weren\u2019t as excited to come to Washington since the Obamas left the White House, they explained that \u201cthe reality is, we had to add four more pages to the guide to accommodate all of the receptions and brunches and parties this year. Although it seems counterintuitive, there\u2019s actually more events happening this year, and I think it speaks to people\u2019s desire to do something\u2014whether that\u2019s network, organize, engage, party or build.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSteve Parker of Usual Suspectz, a promotional group hosting a CBC kickoff event (among others) Tuesday night in conjunction with the Congressional Black Associates at The Park at 14th, feels that more young influencers are taking action planning this year\u2019s events, which is driving anticipation: \u201cI feel like the buzz for this year has been up more than the last few years. The amount of people coming into town earlier in the week has been a big change.\u201d\n\nBoth D\u2019Oyley and the Fab Empire feel like people may feel more of a sense of urgency in celebration this year because of Trump\u2019s presidency. From the Fab Empire: \u201cOne might argue that it\u2019s even more imperative to [network and use the conference as an opportunity to party] this year, since it\u2019s apparent that we need to organize. There\u2019s no better place to do that than the ALC.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Oyley concurs: \u201cIf, under the Obama administration, attendees were social in celebration, under the Trump administration people will continue to be social because they NEED an outlet for their daily frustrations with the political scene.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor many of us in D.C., Obama\u2019s departure from the White House changed the city and many of the black professional parts of it; it just felt \u201cdifferent.\u201d While the party won\u2019t stop, the ALC\u2014including the social scene\u2014may also feel a bit different.\n\nFrom the perspective of the Fab Empire:\n\nThe Obamas not only had an effect on young black professionals in Washington, D.C., but the nation\u2019s capital as a whole. They really ensured that the White House became the \u201cpeople\u2019s house\u201d and you saw that in action. It seemed that more black Washingtonians visited the White House than during Bush\u2019s presidencies and there was more access to the highest people in power. It also helped that young black professionals got more of an opportunity to work in government during his tenure as president. All of that has a trickle-down effect when it comes to the ALC. Those same people walking the White House hallways or marching on Capitol Hill are also attending the ALC and its parties and receptions. The Obamas gave us more than hope\u2014they gave us access.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nD\u2019Oyley agrees:\n\nThere was definitely a different feel for the CBC ALC years under President Obama, especially as President Obama or first lady Michelle Obama often delivered the keynote address at the Annual Phoenix Awards Gala. Knowing that the president and the first lady would be present as an official part of the CBC ALC positively affected the mood. Hearing the president or first lady speak in person was definitely a HUGE draw to attend the awards and a reason to celebrate. Under the Obama administration, the social side of CBC ALC definitely attracted more corporations who hosted big events. That\u2019s continued this year.\n\nSo while the ALC might feel a little different this year, the social scene itself seems primed to be more vibrant and exciting than in past years, possibly out of necessity as we combat the negativity emanating from the current inhabitant of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. For the community, events like the ALC are welcome in times of prosperity but also remind us how much work we need to do, and people attending the conference are here for just that purpose. And when the day\u2019s talks are over ... it looks like we\u2019ll all be partying together in support of unity, no matter who is in office.", "keywords": ["cbc", "events", "trump", "black", "feel", "alc", "social", "party", "house", "stop", "week", "white", "obama", "president", "obamas"], "polarity": 0.10326264576264574, "subjectivity": 0.38217500217500233},

And I know that studies have shown that they have their allies sprinkled around the White House,\u201d Brown said on State of the Union on CNN, HuffPost reports.\n\nBrown went on to slam the president for the way in which he chooses to engage in fights with others, calling him out for the way he seems to purposely not use someone\u2019s name as a way to perhaps demean the other person.\n\n\u201cI would say it\u2019s sad\u2014it\u2019s worse than sad\u2014that the president engages in this kind of name-calling,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI just wish he\u2019d apologize ... he could say, \u2018You know, it didn\u2019t come out right, I\u2019m sorry it came out that way, of course I respect,\u2019 and then mention the congresswoman by name and mention the widow by name. It would be a nice touch if the president would once in a while act that way instead of always attack, always attack, always demean the way he does, too often.\u201d\n\nThe congresswoman being referenced was Wilson, who has been pushed into controversy, having been targeted by the tweeter in chief himself after she stood by the family of Army Sgt. La David Johnson. Johnson was killed in action in Niger, and Wilson, who has been close with the family, has been speaking out on their behalf, attempting to secure answers and closure regarding his death. Instead, however, both Wilson and the family have been met with continued disrespect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe White House itself is full of white supremacists,\u201d Wilson told the New York Times on Friday.\n\nWilson herself made an appearance on MSNBC on Sunday, demanding an apology from White House chief of staff John Kelly for \u201ccharacter assassination,\u201d HuffPost notes, after Kelly lashed out at her, calling her an \u201cempty barrel\u201d and accusing her of falsely taking credit for securing funding for an FBI field office in Miami.\n\n\n\nKelly was quickly proved to be a lying-ass liar after the Sun Sentinel newspaper posted receipts showing that Wilson had never taken such credit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNot only does he owe me an apology, but he owes an apology to the American people,\u201d Wilson said during her Sunday interview.", "keywords": ["miller", "wilson", "brown", "chief", "family", "supremacist", "apology", "senior", "president", "way", "house", "white", "steve", "sen", "sherrod", "ohio", "stephen", "stood"], "polarity": 0.04879019789734074, "subjectivity": 0.3518205009276437},

Everyone\u2019s fixated on the screen and the movie\u2019s jokes may get a laugh or two, but because most everyone there is there working, it\u2019s just not the same as sitting back and just having fun.\n\n\n\nLike a lot of people across the world, I saw Marvel\u2019s Black Panther multiple times this weekend because I wanted to pore deeply over the film\u2019s narrative layers and drink in the visual richness that is Wakanda. But while hopping around from theater to theater, something else\u2014something beautiful about the movie became clear for me: the only way to really appreciate how powerful Black Panther is is to see it in a black movie theater with a predominantly black audience.\n\nBecause of how close it is to my apartment, the AMC Magic Johnson in Harlem is where I\u2019ve ended up seeing nearly every Marvel movie in for the past few years, but the atmosphere in the theater this past Friday was unlike anything I\u2019d ever experienced there before. Long before even stepping foot inside the building, you could tell who had made their way to Harlem specifically to see Black Panther and how, for many people, the night was part of a bigger cultural event. In the light of the lobby you could see groups of women rocking gorgeously-styled geles and excitedly stanning in front of larger than life cutouts of actor Danai Gurira\u2019s Okoye in her Wakandan finest.\n\nKids in panther masks weaved their way in and out of the ridiculously long of people waiting to scan their tickets and even though the place was hectic, you could feel just how pumped everyone was\u2014not just for the movie itself, but to be celebrating something like Black Panther in a distinctly black space.\n\nNo two audiences react to a film the exact same way, but what was enlivening about sitting in a theater full of black families and friends was the way everyone was able to fall into different rhythms with the movie while watching it together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoments like T\u2019Challa\u2019s fight against M\u2019Baku atop Warrior Falls drew everyone together in support of the Royal Family, but you could sense a distinct divide grow in the audience as Erik Killonger argued his case for an expansionist Wakanda. Every time the camera trained its focus on Michael B. Jordan (especially while he was shirtless) someone made a point of reminding everyone just what a vision he is to look at. But just moments later someone on the opposite side of the theater never missed a chance to (lovingly) tut and suck their in disapproval teeth of Killmonger\u2019s extremism. Just as Black Panther was engaged in a very specific kind of dialogue with the audience, we were engaging with one another in real time\u2014a call and response of sorts about the story developing before our eyes.\n\nThere were more than a few scenes\u2014usually after one of Shuri\u2019s flawless zingers\u2014where the entire theater erupted into laughter that drowned out a few seconds of dialogue that no one could hear. In those moments it didn\u2019t feel as if anyone was missing out on the movie, but rather that as a collective, we all slipped into a comfortable familiarity with and understanding of one another that was more important than the specifics of the plot.\n\nBlack Panther\u2019s online hype is a force to be reckoned with, but it doesn\u2019t quite capture how profoundly moving it is to see rows full of little black girls and boys staring up in wonder at the Dora Milaje while they\u2019re kicking ass and taking names. They saw themselves on screen in Black Panther\u2019s heroes and its villains and I saw myself in them\u2014young and vibrant and inspired by the very idea of futuristic, distinctly African blackness destined to save the world from itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of this was exactly the case at the screening on the Upper East Side I attended later in the weekend. The lines were just as long and the excitement was still palpable, but the sense of togetherness and kinship was missing. There were no families posing in front of the Black Panther cardboard standups with their arms proudly crossed in Xes over their chests or carefully placed kente cloth accents as a part of people\u2019s ensembles. I enjoyed the movie all the same, but I couldn\u2019t help but feel as if something important was missing from the experience and I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s something that the theater could have replicated even if it wanted to.\n\nWakanda itself may not be a real place, but the magic and wonder that Black Panther presents itself is. It\u2019s the magic and wonder that all black people know we\u2019re more than capable of creating in the world when we come together and rally behind a cause and it\u2019s something that can never be celebrated enough That power and sense of connected is the narrative foundation upon which Black Panther is built and it\u2019s something that\u2019s best experienced in the company of other black people.", "keywords": ["wonder", "theater", "panther", "black", "missing", "movie", "really", "saw", "way", "sense", "understand", "world"], "polarity": 0.13295068027210888, "subjectivity": 0.4657738095238094},

He asked to borrow a few of the bras he\u2019d modeled, and the friend, 15 at the time, obliged. Kedarie tucked the undergarments into his black and blue school backpack and braced against the biting wind as he walked into the night alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTheir quick exchange was one of the last times Kedarie Johnson was seen alive.\n\n\u201cAt about 11:36 p.m. March 2, 2016, Burlington police found Kedarie\u2019s body, his chest riddled with bullets, discarded in the wild prairie overgrowth of a quiet alley.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe was wearing women\u2019s clothes, and strands of his hair weave had been pulled from his scalp by a garbage bag cinched around his head. A harsh chlorine-like smell hung in the air, and an empty bottle of Dollar General-brand bleach lay edgewise. . . .\u201d\n\nThe Register put the spotlight on an issue that some say has received too little media attention \u2014 violence, sometimes fatal, against transgender people, particularly those of color. The Register story was headlined, \u201cWhat happened to Kedarie Johnson? The mystery of how an LGBTQ teen from Iowa ended up slain in an alley.\u201d\n\nThe story quoted a close family friend, Shaunda Campbell, a former Burlington High counselor. \u201cHere\u2019s a 16-year-old kid going to work at Taco Bell every night, getting off of work late at night, knowing he has to go to school in the morning, and he\u2019s taking his paycheck and putting it with mom\u2019s money so they could rent this motel by the week.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe article also said, \u201cWhile sometimes reported to be a transgender teen, Kedarie\u2019s status isn\u2019t that simple, those who knew him said. Most of the time he presented as male, but he loved to wear hair extensions and leggings. . . .\n\n\u201cAt 16, he was on the cusp of \u2018figuring himself out,\u2019 his pastor, Nathan Williams, said at the time of Kedarie\u2019s death. . . .\u201d\n\nIn August 2016, in the midst of the debate over the North Carolina \u201cbathroom bill\u201d that required people to use public bathrooms matching their birth sex, the Southern Poverty Law Center wrote, \u201cIn the first six months of this year, 14 trans people have been murdered, according to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat puts the year on track to exceed the 21 murders counted by the group in 2014. (The coalition has been criticized for including killings that have not been proven to be hate attacks. On the other hand, it\u2019s likely that cases that were murders of trans people inspired by hatred were missed because of poor reporting by law enforcement officials.) Earlier, the coalition counted 14 murders of trans people in 2013, and 12 in 2014.\u201d\n\nShowing a poster from the Ku Klux Klan declaring that \u201cTransgender is an abomination, according to the King James Bible,\u201d the center wrote, \u201cKu Klux Klan attacks on transgender people are only a small part of a larger movement targeting America\u2019s most vulnerable minority.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was already known that trans people are victimized by hate crime more than others,\u201d it continued. \u201cSeveral years ago, the Intelligence Report, using 14 years of FBI hate crime statistics, found that LGBT people were far more likely to suffer violent hate attacks than any other group. Within that community, anecdotal evidence strongly suggests that trans people, and especially trans women of color, were the most victimized of all. Most of the trans murder victims of the last two years fit that description. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Sunday, the Register editorially gave a rose to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions for assigning a prosecutor to the case of Johnson, who was described as \u201cgender fluid.\u201d\n\n\u201cChristopher J. Perras of the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division will assist Iowa officials in the prosecution of Jorge Sanders-Galvez, who is charged with first-degree murder in Johnson\u2019s shooting death in March 2016,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cThe New York Times reported that the move to add Perras was \u2018personally initiated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur rose is cautionary, however. Sessions has promised to \u2018enforce hate crime laws aggressively and appropriately where transgendered individuals are victims,\u2019 as he told a summit in June. But he\u2019s also reversed protections for transgender people, declaring that federal civil rights law \u2018encompasses discrimination between men and women but does not encompass discrimination based on gender identity, per se, including transgender status.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nThe board also wrote, \u201cMurder and assault aren\u2019t the only ways transgender people are under attack. Sessions did the right thing in intervening in the Johnson case, but he has much more to do to show that his administration cares for the lives of transgender people.\u201d\n\nSouthern Poverty Law Center: SPLC wins asylum for transgender woman who received death threats in Guatemala (Oct. 3)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nABC Nabs Gold Star Widow, Angry About Trump\n\nIn the \u201cget\u201d interview of the news cycle, \u201cThe pregnant widow of U.S. Army Sgt.

He says while he has the right to do so, it isn\u2019t a wise decision and he most likely will not find his wallet still sitting on top of his car when he returns.\n\n\u201cComparing a traumatic sexual assault or rape situation to that of an inanimate object is not only ridiculous, it\u2019s demeaning. Williams was able to diminish an entire nation-wide epidemic down to the inconvenience of losing your wallet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThen he says it\u2019s as equally unwise for college women to \u2018get stoned, use foul language and dance suggestively.\u2019 It\u2019s deplorable to claim women are asking to be assaulted by taking part in normal young adult activities both genders participate in. . . .\u201d\n\nTimes-Dispatch Editorial Page Editor A. Barton Hinkle wrote in his editor\u2019s message:\n\n\u201cOn Saturday, we published a Walter Williams column, \u2018White Privilege and Other Fables,\u2019 that included two paragraphs about sexual assault \u2014 to which many readers have taken strong exception.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs we said in an earlier note, we often publish opinion pieces with which we, too, strenuously disagree \u2014 and we disagreed with Williams\u2019 points in his Saturday column.\n\n\u201cThat was an understatement.\n\n\u201cThe column fell short of our editorial standards. Given the chance to do it all over again, we would not run it \u2014 and certainly not those two paragraphs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn light of that, we are removing the column from Richmond.com, and we are re-evaluating Williams\u2019 place in our stable of syndicated columnists.\n\n\u201cI would like to stress that the Times-Dispatch newsroom had zero role in publishing the column. The News and Editorial departments are entirely separate operations, and News bears no responsibility for anything that appears in the opinion pages.\n\n\u201cThanks to everyone who provided feedback about the column, for reminding us of the importance of striving always to elevate the conversation rather than debase it.

Richmond, Democrat from New Orleans and chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, wrote a three-page letter Wednesday to Donald Trump declining his invitation to the CBC to meet with him, and outlining the many reasons the group as a whole is saying no.\n\nIn a letter dated June 21 (pdf), Richmond opened by acknowledging the president\u2019s recent request to meet with the CBC:\n\nIn written communication dating back to January 2017, we have shared the priorities of the Caucus as they relate to the Black community. We are serious about the work of advancing the interests of our people and the goals of the CBC. As a result, we took advantage of every opportunity to educate you on the needs of the Black community and provide you with the information and solutions necessary to act on them in good faith. Through an objective assessment, we have seen no evidence that your Administration acted on our calls for action, and we have in fact witnessed steps that will affirmatively hurt Black communities. While we agreed to explore possible future discussions when we first met, it has become abundantly clear that a conversation with the entire CBC would not be entirely productive, given the actions taken by your Administration since our first meeting. While you can solicit the engagement of individual members of our caucus, the CBC as a caucus declines your invitation to meet at this time.\n\nRichmond noted that in March, the CBC presented Trump with a 130-page policy document in order to educate him and his administration on the difficult history of black people in the United States, the history of the CBC and solutions that could help advance black families in the 21st century. The Trump administration has both failed to respond to the policies the CBC outlined and neglected to follow through on its pledge to facilitate meetings between the CBC and relevant Cabinet officials, Richmond said.\n\nIn other words, Trump and his administration have only paid lip service to addressing the needs of black people in the U.S. and never intended to follow through on any of the empty promises that have been made thus far.\n\nIn fact, as Richmond outlined, the administration has acted in opposition to the policy initiatives the caucus has supported, proposing budget cuts to programs that serve low- and moderate-income people, including a $4 billion cut to Pell Grants, which help low-income students pay for college; and the complete elimination of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, \u201cwhich helps seniors and other helpless populations heat their homes in the winter and cool them in the summer.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the letter, Richmond added:\n\nMoreover, your administration has taken actions that cause legitimate alarm among members of this caucus and the millions of Americans we represent. In a two-page document, your Attorney General issued guidance to federal prosecutors to accelerate the failed war on drugs that will continue to wreck the Black community and exacerbate our nation\u2019s scourge of mass incarceration. Attorney General Sessions has also explicitly stated his unwillingness to utilize consent decrees to protect the civil rights of Americans and has called for an agency-wide review of these agreements. These shortsighted decisions represent willful ignorance by relying on ideology instead of data and compassion. Every dollar we spend on incarceration renders our communities less safe.\n\nIn other words, we see your boy implementing and creating policies that specifically and disproportionately target the black community at large, and this is not a game, Mr. President.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, Richmond continued, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has caused a number of HBCUs to lose critical funding through the \u201cTRiO\u201d programs (a reference to a number of federal programs intended to help economically disadvantaged students) (pdf), she has refused to protect children from being discriminated against, and she terminated an Obama administration program focused on improving school diversity and student achievement in the lowest-performing schools across the country.\n\nOf course, these atrocities pale in comparison with the decimation of our nation\u2019s health care system. Richmond noted that black people make up 13.3 percent of the U.S. population but 19 percent of Medicaid enrollees, and would therefore be dealt a painful blow by \u201cmean[-spirited]\u201d legislation proposed under the Trump administration.\n\nRichmond went on to outline eight times the CBC has sent written letters to Trump himself and members of his administration, letters that have thus far gone unanswered, because clearly neither the president nor anyone who works for him truly cares about black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRichmond concluded, \u201cGiven the lack of response to any of the main concerns we have raised with you and your Administration, we decline your invitation for all 49 members of the Congressional Black Caucus to meet with you. The CBC, and the millions of people we represent, have a lot to lose under your Administration. I fail to see how a social gathering would benefit the policies we advocate for. The CBC will always be willing to engage in discussion and debate about policies and programs that will make America a more perfect union for all.\u201d\n\nIn other words, fuck your photo ops and bullshit promises.\n\nCedric Richmond had the words and the tact to say what we are all thinking in a much nicer way than the president deserves, but he was also direct, pointed and full of facts, and called Trump out for being full of shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe, \u201cthe blacks,\u201d are tired of the empty promises of the American dream and the \u201cmore perfect union.\u201d We need results that benefit us as much as they benefit those who hold privilege over us.\n\nEnough is enough.\n\nEither shit or get off the pot, Donald Trump.", "keywords": ["members", "cbc", "policies", "programs", "trump", "caucus", "black", "dont", "words", "richmond", "administration", "care", "congressional"], "polarity": 0.03136604136604137, "subjectivity": 0.4895652290096733},

They were the best and strongest women from the 18 villages within Wakanda and trained at the royal palace.\n\nBut while Priest may in part cite supermodels as his inspiration, there is a historical prototype for the Dora Milaje in the Dahomey \u201cAmazons\u201d\u2014so nicknamed by European colonizers and now known by the French-speaking Beninese as the \u201cN\u2019Nonmiton\u201d (which translates to \u201cour mothers\u201d in Fon).\n\nCreated by King Agaja of the West African nation of Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) in the 18th century, the N\u2019Nonmiton were an all-female guard and fighting force, likely inspired by the female hunters known as gbeto. Like the Dora Milaje, the N\u2019Nonmiton were also considered wives of the king, pledging celibacy as well as loyalty and protection to him. And they existed in this role until the colonization of Dahomey in the late 19th century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can learn all about the incredible female warriors of Dahomey in a 2015 episode of the podcast Stuff You Missed in History Class, and in a very comprehensive comic on their history created by UNESCO for its Series on Women in African History (pdf).

La David Johnson, remain.\n\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph F. Dunford Jr. told reporters during a press conference that members of a U.S.-Nigerien patrol were conducting a routine reconnaissance mission and were on their way back to their base when the troops were ambushed by about 50 ISIS-affiliated fighters, the Washington Post reports.\n\nBut it took the troops nearly an hour to call for help, according to the Pentagon. Once they did, an Army drone was immediately deployed and took aerial pictures of the attack. One hour later, French fighter jets reached the American and Nigerien troops\u2014but by then, the firefight was already over.\n\nThe Pentagon is currently investigating whether villagers in the Niger-Mali border town the troopers were patrolling may have set up the soldiers. Dunford said that the Pentagon is also investigating whether the U.S. Special Forces team altered their mission, whether they had the means to call for help and how Johnson wound up being separated from the group.\n\nJohnson\u2019s body was not recovered until two days after the attack.

But it wasn\u2019t until Trump lied about his condolence calls to Gold Star families (he claimed that previous presidents, including Barack Obama, had not done this) and insulted Johnson\u2019s widow, Myeshia Johnson, that the story began to dominate the news cycle.\n\nAccording to the Post, Dunford struck a \u201cmarkedly different tone\u201d from either Trump or his chief of staff, John Kelly, in addressing the government\u2019s responsibility to the soldiers killed in the Niger attack:\n\nThe Pentagon, he said, owes the families of the four slain soldiers \u2014 in addition to Johnson, Staff Sgt.

It showed that \u201cA majority of health care professionals \u2014 including doctors, nurses, and physician assistants \u2014 say patients have made offensive comments to them based on their age, gender, ethnic background, race, weight, or other personal traits.

Why does he keep trying to harm me and malign my character?\u2019\n\n\u201cIn an appearance Thursday at the White House, Kelly delivered a broadside against Wilson, a Democrat who has represented parts of Miami-Dade and South Broward since 2011.

Kelly, a Marine Corps general at the time, was at the event in his role as the head of the U.S. Southern Command.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilson detracted from the event, he said, when she \u201cstood up, and in the long tradition of empty barrels making the most noise, stood up there and all of that and talked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building, and how she took care of her constituents because she got the money, and she just called up President [Barack] Obama, and on that phone call he gave the money \u2014 the $20 million \u2014 to build the building. And she sat down, and we were stunned. Stunned that she had done it. Even for someone that is that empty a barrel, we were stunned.\u201d\n\n\u201cExclusive video from the South Florida Sun Sentinel of the event shows Kelly\u2019s account was not true.\n\n\u201cWhat Wilson did at the dedication was take credit for the fast-track approval of legislation \u2014 sought by the FBI \u2014 to name the building for FBI agents Benjamin P. Grogan and Jerry L. Dove, who were killed in a 1986 gunfight with two people who had robbed armored trucks and banks and murdered several people. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe editorial board wrote, \u201cAh, John Kelly. Did you really have to go there? Did you really have to use your gravitas as a retired general and father of a soldier killed in Afghanistan to defend President Trump\u2019s tantrum about a phone call?\n\n\u201cWe expected so much more when the president tapped you to replace former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus in July.

If a person can afford to pay the full amount, he\u2019ll be released immediately and receive that money back from the court if he shows up for subsequent hearings.\n\n\u201cBut 44 percent of Americans would struggle to cover a $400 emergency. For those without resources, the path to freedom lies with a bondsman, who typically charges about 10 percent of the full bail amount to act as the guarantor or surety for the rest. If the defendant can\u2019t afford the bondsman\u2019s fee up front, many bond companies will set up an installment plan and charge interest. That money will never be refunded to the defendant, no matter how his case is resolved.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBondsmen, however, don\u2019t have to pay the court anything when they get a client released: They simply promise to ensure that he will show up in court for later hearings. If the client fails to do so, the bondsman must pay the bail in full, but in practice bondsmen usually crack down on whoever signed the bond \u2014 family or friends, in most cases \u2014and force them to pay it instead.\n\n\u201cIn most states, the bail industry has successfully pushed laws that make it very difficult for courts to get full bail amounts from bondsmen. Anyone who can\u2019t afford to post bail or pay the bondsman will . . . sit in jail until the district attorney makes a decision about whether to go forward with the charges. In New Orleans, that is on average a month for a misdemeanor; for a felony, the average is nearly four months. . . .\u201d\n\nMaura Ewing, Slate: Punished for Being Poor\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHate Group Draws Little Notice From Authorities\n\n\u201cProPublica spent weeks examining one distinctive group at the center of the violence in Charlottesville: an organization called the Rise Above Movement, one of whose members was the white man dispensing beatings near Emancipation Park Aug. 12,\u201d A.C.

In a city that is majority black, somehow Jones lost to Krewson by a mere 888 votes (30.4 percent to 32 percent), less than a city block. Her loss shines the light on how sexism, racism and incompetence by black political leadership continue to stymie black progress even in this age of \u201cresistance.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones, like Marilyn Mosby in Baltimore and Nina Turner in Cleveland, is part of a vanguard of black female activist-politicians who have arisen in the last several years to challenge the racial and gender status quo of major cities in America. St. Louis, despite being a majority-black city, has remained primarily in the hands of the white minority because whites have crossed party lines to coalesce around whatever white candidate is running for mayor, and city districts have been gerrymandered to diffuse black political power. Opportunities for black political advancement are few and far between, and this year\u2019s mayoral race was one of those chances.\n\nWhen Jones, whose prominence as St. Louis city treasurer skyrocketed because of her outspoken activism post-Ferguson, jumped into the race, conventional wisdom said that the top four black candidates would cancel one another out, allowing Krewson to win. As Jones gained in the polls, especially after ethering the St. Louis Post-Dispatch for systematic racism, and once she got the powerful endorsement of former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander, one of the other black candidates, all of them men, needed to go. It was the only chance for St. Louis\u2019 black residents to finally get progressive representation. It didn\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be honest: The men decided to stay in this race because of their ego. And where are we now? We still have the status quo candidate that\u2019s going to be in that office for the next four years,\u201d Jones said in an interview with the Post-Dispatch after the election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe other main black candidates\u2014Alderman Jeffery Boyd (who received 2.7 percent of the vote); Alderman Antonio French (15.8 percent), who shot to national stardom as one of the main must-follows on Twitter during Ferguson in 2014; and, finally, Lewis Reed, president of the Board of Alderman (18.3 percent), who had lost the mayor\u2019s race in 2014 by almost 10 percent\u2014needed to think of the collective good instead of their own political egos. Had just one of these men dropped out of the race, St. Louis would likely have elected its first African-American woman as mayor. Yet they persisted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really disappointed that the ego, patriarchy and sexism won the day yesterday,\u201d Jones told The Root. \u201cWhen all the black candidates met before filing closed, only the black women decided to work together and support each other. When will we come together for the common good? Even if all the men in the race got together and decided to go with one male candidate, we would have had a much different outcome.\u201d\n\nTo be fair, there is plenty of blame to go around for this debacle in St. Louis, and much of if is self-imposed wounds. Similar to the poor turnout in the first postriot Ferguson elections, there was a 6 percent increase in mayoral primary voters between the 2013 and 2017 elections, but it was still only 28 percent of eligible voters in the city. There are 196,150 registered voters in St. Louis, but only 55,635 turned out. It makes Jones\u2019 888-loss margin all the more disturbing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones\u2019 loss is symptomatic of a larger problem in the black community when it comes to navigating race and gender in state and municipal politics. All too often, while black male politicians want to maintain old lines of succession, patriarchy and Democratic Party politics, black women are locked out, and white voters, always willing to put race ahead of gender, stay winning.\n\nThat\u2019s why 96 percent of black women rallied behind Hillary Clinton while 14 percent of black men voted for Donald Trump. That\u2019s why the mostly male members of the Congressional Black Caucus could support white candidate Chris Van Hollen over a black woman, Donna Edwards, for the Senate from Maryland (one of the safest seats in the nation). Then say nothing when Van Hollen won and hired only one black senior staffer despite once representing a district that is 30 percent African American. Politically, black men are in \u201cthe sunken place.\u201d\n\nQuentin James, CEO of Collective PAC, an organization dedicated to raising money for progressive black candidates, raised money and sent out texts on behalf of Jones for mayor. James also wrote an angry op-ed about the sexist dynamics of the St. Louis race and pointed out to The Root that black progress can\u2019t happen until we get candidates who are focused on black policy, not just their own power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn African-American political observer of St. Louis politics who spoke on condition of anonymity was even more candid: \u201cWe fucking endorse white people and get nothing out of it! A random fucking white woman is mayor of St. Louis because black people can\u2019t get their fucking act together.\u201d\n\nIn the short term, St. Louis is the loser. Krewson will continue the city\u2019s slow, long walk to political and economic irrelevance, and the city\u2019s black majority will get blocked out of what passes for economic development. In the long term, this race should be a sobering lesson for the upcoming races in Miami, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, New York and dozens of other municipalities across America this year. Black political leaders need to become more organized and more sophisticated and recognize that low turnout and petty infighting are never a recipe for black empowerment.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: A previous version of this story stated that Sen. Van Hollen had \u201chired no black staffers.\u201d No Democratic senator who represents an area with more than 20 percent of African-American voters has hired any any African Americans for the positions of chief of staff, legislative director and communications director, commonly referred to as senior staff. Van Hollen has hired African-American staffers, and hired an African-American woman as director of external relations and community outreach, which has been deemed a senior staff position for his office.", "keywords": ["tishaura", "city", "black", "sinks", "st", "louis", "votes", "jones", "mayors", "men", "magic", "white", "woman", "mayor", "male", "race", "political"], "polarity": 0.01157398366044983, "subjectivity": 0.43229339582723},

La David Johnson, was killed in Niger earlier this month.\n\nThe press lauded Kelly\u2019s speech as \u201cextraordinary\u201d\u2014largely because he rarely speaks on the record and because the typically guarded Kelly got personal. But Kelly saved particularly harsh condemnation for Wilson, who first spoke to the press about Trump\u2019s insensitive comments to Myeshia Johnson.\n\nIn the conversation, Trump reportedly told Myeshia that her husband \u201cknew what he signed up for.\u201d According to Wilson, Myeshia was particularly shaken up because the president didn\u2019t even seem to know La David\u2019s name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKelly attacked Wilson for listening in on the conversation. The former general also told a story about Wilson that supposedly showcased her selfishness and narcissism: an anecdote about a building dedication in Miami to two slain FBI agents.\n\n\u201cA congresswoman stood up,\u201d said Kelly, referring to the Democratic lawmaker, CNN reports, \u201cand in a long tradition of empty barrels making the most noise, stood up there in all of that and talked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building, and how she took care of her constituents because she got the money, and she just called up President Obama, and on that phone call, he gave the money\u2014the $20 million\u2014to build the building, and she sat down, and we were stunned.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilson quickly pushed back on Kelly\u2019s story, telling CNN\u2019s New Day that she \u201cwas not even in Congress in 2009, when the money for the building was secured.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s a lie,\u201d said the Florida Democrat. Wilson also pointed out that Kelly labeling her an \u201cempty barrel\u201d was racist.\n\nAnd wouldn\u2019t you know it, the Sun Sentinel backed her up, releasing a video of her full remarks that day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot once does Wilson take credit for securing the money for the building. She did take credit for naming the building after the two slain FBI agents\u2014but as Toronto Star reporter Daniel Dale points out, then-FBI Director James Comey gave her credit, too.\n\nIn fact, the video plainly shows that Wilson credited both Republican and Democratic lawmakers with speeding up what is normally a tedious and prolonged process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKelly got it all the way wrong, but it should come as no surprise that the White House is sticking by its version of events, according to The Hill. As a matter of fact, the White House is doubling down.\n\n\u201cGen. Kelly said he was \u2018stunned\u2019 that Rep. Wilson made comments at a building dedication honoring slain FBI agents about her own actions in Congress, including lobbying former President Obama on legislation,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said.\n\n\u201cAs Gen. Kelly pointed out, if you\u2019re able to make a sacred act like honoring American heroes about yourself, you\u2019re an empty barrel,\u201d Sanders continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the White House has no damn business entering a conversation about what\u2019s sacred or what\u2019s honorable.\n\nThis administration has persistently targeted and denigrated black women\u2014a pattern underscored by its repeated \u201cempty barrel\u201d insults aimed at Wilson.\n\nAs Jamelle Bouie of Slate notes, in the last 9 months, Trump\u2019s White House has called for the head of ESPN anchor Jemelle Hill for calling the president a white supremacist. Journalist April Ryan and Congresswoman Maxine Waters have also come into the administration\u2019s crosshairs, as did former national security adviser Susan Rice for \u201cunmasking\u201d Trump officials following the election. Now, the White House has waged war against Wilson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be clear, Kelly didn\u2019t just completely misrepresent Wilson\u2019s behavior and words. In calling her an empty barrel, he was calling her loud and stupid.\n\nNot only is that about as mean-spirited a remark as a man in his position could make about a fellow public servant, but it also follows a long American tradition of dismissing black women by insulting their intelligence and their value. Kelly implied that Wilson has no business speaking up so loudly, so vociferously, because she\u2019s \u201cempty,\u201d which is to say, unworthy. It was for her he saved his most vitriolic comments\u2014saying nothing of the president he serves, the dotard who politicized the entire event to begin with when he compared his outreach to military families with Obama\u2019s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLest we forget, it was Trump who dragged Kelly and his son\u2019s death into this news cycle. And yet it was Wilson whom Kelly attacked with the ferocity of a frothing pitbull. It was she whom Kelly tried to paint as a self-promoting narcissist.\n\nIt\u2019s worth remembering that Sgt. La David Johnson\u2019s death first drew attention because of the questionable circumstances surrounding it\u2014an issue that Wilson continues to raise even as her enemies try to drag her down.\n\n\u201cMy emphasis today is on my constituents and helping them lay our hero to rest,\u201d the congresswoman told CNN on Friday morning. \u201cThat\u2019s where my head is today.

Even less known is the fact that 700 of them are state legislators: state representatives, delegates and state senators, many congregating in state capitals in nearly all the 50 states, in addition to the District of Columbia and the pretty much all-black U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nWhat is virtually unknown is that those legislators meet annually as the National Black Caucus of State Legislators.\n\nEven as the NBCSL just wrapped up its 40th Annual Legislative Conference in New Orleans on Dec. 3, it was done with little fanfare, no public press releases and just a few rushed tweets by the end of the conference. Beyond a one-man presence from The Root, there was no sign of any other media outlets.\n\nAdding to its mystique is that the organization found itself still suffering from a monthslong malware-corrupted website, which outgoing NBCSL chairwoman and Maryland state Sen. Catherine Pugh (soon to be Baltimore\u2019s next mayor) claimed was \u201crepeatedly hacked\u201d when asked by miffed NBCSL members.\n\nAs bad as that may look, however, don\u2019t sleep on the NBCSL. With those numbers, none of the above eliminates the NBCSL\u2019s truly massive importance as an august national body of black political power. Even if we can\u2019t link to its website at the moment, it still manages to somehow connect and coordinate these 700 legislators, occasionally corralling crucial policy coordination on a wide range of issues when needed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack state legislators are like a first line of defense standing between national sanity and the global tempest that is Donald Trump, plus a fully decked GOP Congress. Need to change police-conduct standards? Call your local black state rep or senator because that's in their wheelhouse. When Trump\u2019s proposed $1 trillion infrastructure plan rolls out and trickles to states, black state officials will be key on oversight. And issues like education reform, charter schools and vouchers can\u2019t really move without black state legislators' eyes on them.\n\nFull of enthusiasm, newly elected incoming Chairman and Indiana state Rep. Greg Porter (D-Indianapolis) seems intent on preparing the NBCSL for an expectedly unforgiving social and political age with Trump. Porter talked tirelessly of the need to \u201cpush hard\u201d and \u201cremain relevant,\u201d showing an awareness that if the NBCSL isn't publicly relevant, desperate black communities looking for a path forward won\u2019t find much. \u201cWe have to understand what we face in terms of the possible intended and unintended consequences,\u201d he mused. Black state legislators convened in NOLA full of uncertainty, but anxiously stood firm in being willing to rise to the occasion.\n\nThis year\u2019s conference \u201ccould not have happened at a better time for the organization,\u201d said Louisiana Rep. Ted James (D-Baton Rouge), his district still struggling in the aftershocks of historic summer flooding. \u201cThe takeaway from this is we must not grow weary in well doing. We recognize all politics is local, and the battle will begin in state legislative houses across this nation with redistricting.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the 2020 census on the horizon, redistricting was, perhaps, the most discussed topic of those on the NBCSL agenda. Publicly, it\u2019s not the sexiest issue on the block; nor will it grab a headline the same way a police shooting does. Yet black state legislators are nervously on the front line of it, most expressing frustration that the census woefully undercounts the national black population and that, unfortunately, many black constituents don\u2019t help the situation by avoiding it. The significance of redistricting and racial gerrymandering cannot be underestimated: It plays a central role in structurally consolidating Republican political power to a gargantuan and potentially tyrannical degree.\n\nA deliberately sophisticated numbers game, the next national census will have enormous long-term impact\u2014it can either expand black political and economic clout \u2026 or it can wipe it out. Simply put: Fewer black people being counted in the census means even less ability to do anything about what troubles us. \u201cIt\u2019s critical we have these numbers to fight off the type of onslaught we\u2019re going to face in the next few years,\u201d Pugh argued.\n\n\u201cWe have to be in the game of understanding redistricting,\u201d added Porter. \u201cThose who have the influence, who have the power, draw the maps to benefit them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNBCSL Vice Chairwoman and South Carolina state Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter (D-Orangeburg) offered a more ominous assessment. \u201cWe are almost too late when you think about 2020,\u201d said Cobb-Hunter. \u201cA lot of the myths and misconceptions among our people surrounding the census suggests we have a lot of work to do.\u201d\n\nOthers, like New Jersey state Sen. Ron Rice (D-Newark), argued that\u2019s why black elected officials must press aggressively for more collaboration among the state-, local- and federal-level groups, like NBCSL, the Congressional Black Caucus, the African American Mayors Association and the National Black Caucus of Locally Elected Officials. \u201cThis day and age, we can\u2019t be playing around,\u201d said Rice.\n\n\u201cWe have to acknowledge the need to coordinate on a number of issues, like jobs, crime, education, and know what the other is doing,\u201d argued Rice, who describes how a micro version of that has been achieved in the Garden State. \u201cThese different groups should be coming together at least once annually and sharing ideas and intelligence on a formal basis. I\u2019m not interested in folks politics, but I am interested in finding common ground on policy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTennessee state Rep. Harold Love (D-Nashville) agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have a gathering like this because there may be some model legislation done in Arizona or North Carolina that I don\u2019t know about in Tennessee,\u201d Love said. \u201cFor example, last year I remember learning about legislation from North Carolina dealing with the automatic expungement of arrest records if someone was arrested but found not to have committed the crime.\n\n\u201cAnd as NBCSL, we might find more emphasis placed on what we do, since the federal government might be gridlocked,\" he continued. \u201cEverything that doesn\u2019t pass on the federal government level can be passed on the state level.\u201d\n\nOne can even make the argument that NBCSL has more bite than the better-known Congressional Black Caucus. CBC members themselves, the majority hailing from the state legislator space, might be privately inclined to admit this. The CBC brands better, for sure. But state legislative work is sweaty, in-the-trenches grunt work (a trip to Congress, in comparison, is a perks-riddled retirement package). It\u2019s where most policy work is actually done, for better or for worse, quietly and mostly headline free, yet full of national ramifications. Washington, D.C., even with a one-party federal government starting in January, may get very little done as policymakers on the left and right are mired in petty partisan fights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany acknowledged that fact in New Orleans last week, full of sighs, but battle-ready for the prospect that a lot of heavy policy lifting will fall on them.\n\nCharles D.

In the past four years, the third-generation hairstylist has been making her mark on Marvel films, leading the hair departments of the last two Captain America films, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and, now, Black Panther.\n\nOf course, the Black Panther is a unique superhero, and Black Panther is already proving to be an exceptionally unique film, as Friend tells The Glow Up:\n\nI think Black Panther is\u2014I call it a stand-alone Marvel movie, even though Marvel still has a formula. But I feel like it\u2019s a stand-alone movie, especially for me, because I\u2019m a black woman, and [to do] the first black superhero, that was really an honor, in the sense [that] we\u2019re presenting all of this to the world. We had an important job to do, and I looked at it in a whole different way, because it represents my people.

To begin, she divided the film into three elements: traditional Africa, contemporary Africa and the futuristic Africa represented by the technologically advanced civilization that is Wakanda. In her research, she drew inspiration from everything from traditional African tribes like the Maasai and Zulu to the groundbreaking fashion statements we\u2019ve seen at Afropunk celebrations around the globe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really taking and looking at traditional styles, traditional tribal looks, and seeing what we can make into a modern style,\u201d Friend says. \u201cI like to take, like, a period hairstyle and put it in a modern movie and just put a twist on it. For me, it\u2019s still about classic hairdressing and beautiful lines and silhouettes.

But whether it\u2019s long and flowing or elaborately braided and twisted, one thing you won\u2019t see in Black Panther is any straightened hair. For Friend, natural hair textures were a major part of her contribution to the visual narrative.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a beautiful time where people are wearing their natural hair,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, there [are] women everywhere who are like, \u2018Throw the pressing comb away, throw the relaxer away. I\u2019m going to wear my natural hair.\u2019 So that whole movement of the empowerment of the hair is there,\u201d Friend explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a diverse universe of naturally styled characters involved a team highly skilled in styling, caring for and mimicking natural hairstyles, as in the case of Angela Bassett\u2019s glorious custom-made wig of 24-inch silvery locs, inspired in equal parts by writer Toni Morrison and director Ryan Coogler\u2019s mother, Joselyn.\n\nBut while Friend isn\u2019t playing favorites on the styles she created, she\u2019s already seeing the influence this film is having on our beauty and fashion choices. She\u2019s received countless raves on the twisted crop Lupita Nyong\u2019o rocks as Dora Milaje operative Nakia and graciously provided The Glow Up with the how-to (hint: The key is keeping it close to the scalp):\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018Wakanda knot\u2019\u2014because it is different than a Bantu knot,\u201d she tells us. \u201c[Because] basically, the hair is rolled down, kind of like a cinnamon roll. And then, once the hair is dried, then, we lifted it from there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEducating other hairstylists is a huge part of Friend\u2019s career, as her greatest hope is to see more hairstylists performing at the top of their game. That\u2019s why she created Hair Scholars, a consortium of award-winning artists led by Friend in educating and preparing aspiring stylists to be the best at their craft and ready to work in the industry.\n\nFriend knows firsthand the value of having a talented team by her side. She credits her Black Panther team for being a large part of the inspiration and craftsmanship that we\u2019ll see on-screen next week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt just felt like our brains\u2014the brainpower was just so high, and the energy was so high, just because we got to create,\u201d she says. \u201cOr somebody\u2019s like, \u2018Well, let\u2019s try this.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Let\u2019s try it!\u2019\n\n\u201cSo it was really great to have that think tank, where we could just be in there and be creating, and just really coming up with things on the fly ... just really having the momentum just to create original pieces that are going to stand the test of time on film,\u201d she continues.\n\nAnd of course, we couldn\u2019t end our conversation without asking Friend how it felt to be on the purple carpet for Black Panther\u2019s epic premiere in Los Angeles last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe premiere was like, you know, it was like 2018 Coming to America\u2014like, it was for real. People took it all the way,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think what it is too, is as black people, we have like\u2014especially now\u2014there\u2019s a sense of pride. People are wearing their hair natural. People are [saying] \u2018black excellence.\u2019 People are rising to the occasion, and I think this movie comes at the time where black people, we want to step forward; we want to be recognized.\n\n\u201cThis movie hits all the right notes for having a black superhero,\u201d she explains. \u201cI mean, at the end of the day, we all want to be superheroes, in whatever we do. If we\u2019re a mom, if we\u2019re a secretary, if we\u2019re a hairdresser\u2014whatever we do, we all want to be a superhero.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re an Los Angeles-based hair artist, you can join Camille Friend for a Hair Scholars master class at the \u201cHair and Makeup by ... \u201d Symposium on March 11 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.", "keywords": ["meet", "hero", "hair", "black", "panther", "camille", "friend", "movie", "traditional", "designer", "really", "panthers", "teamsupernatural", "natural", "think", "having"], "polarity": 0.17398076259489295, "subjectivity": 0.5284920634920632},

There's more to economic development than the urban centers of America,\" said CBC Chairman G.K. Butterfield to The Root when asked about whether Trump's professed concern for inner cities during the campaign was real.\n\n\"Perhaps there can be some common ground on infrastructure; it creates jobs,\" Butterfield added. \"But that's the top line, not the bottom line. \u2026 I think there is opportunity for the Congressional Black Caucus to have common ground with the new administration.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough Butterfield went on to say that Trump's appointment of Steve Bannon as a White House senior adviser was \"disgusting\" and \"not a good way to start his administration,\" the CBC chairman did attempt to be open to what may come next.\n\nIn a Nov. 13 email to fellow Democrats obtained by The Root, Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) stated, \"Our party\u2019s infrastructure has been decimated and our brand denigrated. We must rebuild and rebrand, and we must start now.\" Clyburn is supporting South Carolina state Chairman Jamie Harrison as the next chair of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nMembers of the CBC met for dinner at a downtown restaurant in Washington, D.C., Monday night to discuss what's next. The CBC regularly meets for dinner off Capitol Hill, but this gathering is likely to include a full discussion about what's next for the Democratic Party. A member of the CBC, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), is also competing to become the chair of the DNC, and he has several party leaders already supporting him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We need to take an assessment about why we are in the place we are in today. I think it is important that we have all hands on deck to make sure that we get this thing corrected. A lot of us know what the problem is. I believe in order to do it, we need to have a DNC chair who is there 24-7. We need a full-time DNC chair,\" Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio) told The Root near the House floor Monday night, Congress' first day in session after the election.\n\nRep. Alcee Hastings (D-Fla.) emphatically spoke to The Root about what the Democratic Party could have done better to get out black voters. Hastings was asked whether the party will ever listen to strategic advice from black elected officials on the ground.\n\n\"That's a good question,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope so. They did make a course correction in my congressional district about six days before the election because I raised so much sand about it. I still think that disproportionately, money was spent on television\u2014$67 million by the Clinton campaign\u2014and a pittance on the ground by comparison.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I would have had a considerable amount more money in the African-American and Latino communities being utilized by the people who live in those communities,\" Hastings added.\n\nThe DNC is notorious for \"air-dropping\" in staff that aren't local to the community they're campaigning in.\n\n\"I will never participate in another campaign that does not start with a ground game at the bottom. That includes 2018. We have a Senate race. We have a gubernatorial race. If they're going to wait until two weeks to come to my community, they won't have me active in their campaign,\" Hastings said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHastings told The Root that had the Clinton campaign spent $2 million in grassroots spending on the ground in Florida, she would have won the state. No member of the CBC who spoke with The Root was able to say that he or she was given an active, strategic role in Clinton's campaign, and it's a complaint that is not new.\n\nThe selection of the DNC chair will be the first test for the party and black Democrats in the coming days and weeks.\n\nLauren Victoria Burke is a Washington, D.C.-based political reporter who writes the Crew of 42 blog.

Burgone was also a classmate of Sean Christopher Urbanski, the savagely violent 22-year-old charged with plunging a knife into the chest of Richard Collins III days before Collins was scheduled to graduate from Bowie State University. Collins had also recently been commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApparently, Burgone hung out with a group of no-good gangsters who preyed on innocent people, and when one of them went on Facebook to praise the homicidal act, Burgone couldn\u2019t help chiming in because, you know, \u201cthose people\u201d have no self-control.\n\nIf you think referring to these thugs as \u201cgangsters\u201d is pejorative, you should know that these men consider themselves \u201coriginal gangsters,\u201d a term used almost exclusively by young Caucasian males who saw Boyz n the Hood late one night on HBO while making crystal meth in the bathtub or caught Menace to Society on Hulu.

We all know that wypipo are genetically inferior when it comes to memes, so here it is:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo its credit, when the Anne Arundel Police Department heard about the racist posts, it immediately suspended Burgone and issued a statement:\n\nThe actions of this employee are a betrayal of the values of the Anne Arundel County Police Department. Any employee who espouses or supports hateful or racist ideology will be held accountable and we will not allow the public\u2019s trust in their police department to be eroded.\n\nThe statement made no mention of one incontrovertible fact that bears repeating once more: A police department thought this guy would make an excellent law-enforcement officer because obviously, his decision-making skills demonstrate that he would have no problem assessing situations with a gun in his hand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, we must acknowledge that young Caucasian males grow up accustomed to gun violence that manifests itself as school shootings, white supremacy or stabbing soldiers in the chest at bus stops, so we shouldn\u2019t blame them for espousing hate on the internet. We should recognize that they are trapped in the inner cities with nothing but privilege, sharp knives and all those exclamation marks. What should we expect of them?\n\nLook at the name!

Surprise!\n\nHonestly, most research that surfaces about the harmful effects of racism leaves the majority of us unimpressed and unsurprised. It\u2019s been proved that experiencing racism is tied to stress, heart disease, pregnancy complications and probably everything else you can think of that can lead to death or a lower quality of life.\n\nThis week, researchers at King\u2019s College London released a study that links adolescent smoking habits to racial discrimination. They surveyed more than 6,500 young people from London schools at several points between ages 11 and 23 and found that those who experienced racism were up to 80 percent more likely to pick up their first cigarette by their 16th birthday. According to the study, students who reported positive relationships with family or a tie to religion were less likely to pick up smoking habits despite exposure to racial discrimination.\n\n\u201cAn important point here is that racism affects both physical and mental health outcomes,\u201d said professor Seeromani Harding, principal investigator of the study. \u201cAddressing racism is an important public health priority for young people.\u201d Researchers do note that there isn\u2019t enough data to show causation between racism and teen smoking, but the evidence does mirror recent trends in adolescent behavior.\n\n\n\nIf addressing racism as a public health priority sounds like common sense, it\u2019s probably because you\u2019re on the receiving end of racism\u2014but for folks on the other side, common sense ain\u2019t so common.\n\n", "keywords": ["turning", "watch", "racial", "health", "public", "racism", "study", "sense", "teens", "smokers", "common", "smoking", "young", "researchers"], "polarity": 0.061946386946386954, "subjectivity": 0.4582042957042957},

Because Kelly thought he could completely misrepresent a story about Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.)\u2014one that paints her as self-serving and self-aggrandizing; that he could insult her intelligence; that he could engage in some grand-ass moral posturing about what is \u201csacred\u201d in this country, and get away with it.\n\n\n\nBut we live in a world of receipts, and the Sun Sentinel whipped out an incredible one\u2014directly refuting a story Kelly told about Wilson in which he referred to her as an \u201cempty barrel.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Kelly addressed the press on the controversy surrounding President Donald Trump and his remarks to a Gold Star widow, Myeshia Johnson, whose husband, Sgt. La David Johnson, was killed in Niger earlier this month.\n\nThe press lauded Kelly\u2019s speech as \u201cextraordinary\u201d\u2014largely because he rarely speaks on the record and because the typically guarded Kelly got personal. But Kelly saved particularly harsh condemnation for Wilson, who first spoke to the press about Trump\u2019s insensitive comments to Myeshia Johnson.\n\nIn the conversation, Trump reportedly told Myeshia that her husband \u201cknew what he signed up for.\u201d According to Wilson, Myeshia was particularly shaken up because the president didn\u2019t even seem to know La David\u2019s name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKelly attacked Wilson for listening in on the conversation. The former general also told a story about Wilson that supposedly showcased her selfishness and narcissism: an anecdote about a building dedication in Miami to two slain FBI agents.\n\n\u201cA congresswoman stood up,\u201d said Kelly, referring to the Democratic lawmaker, CNN reports, \u201cand in a long tradition of empty barrels making the most noise, stood up there in all of that and talked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building, and how she took care of her constituents because she got the money, and she just called up President Obama, and on that phone call, he gave the money\u2014the $20 million\u2014to build the building, and she sat down, and we were stunned.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilson quickly pushed back on Kelly\u2019s story, telling CNN\u2019s New Day that she \u201cwas not even in Congress in 2009, when the money for the building was secured.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s a lie,\u201d said the Florida Democrat. Wilson also pointed out that Kelly labeling her an \u201cempty barrel\u201d was racist.\n\nAnd wouldn\u2019t you know it, the Sun Sentinel backed her up, releasing a video of her full remarks that day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot once does Wilson take credit for securing the money for the building. She did take credit for naming the building after the two slain FBI agents\u2014but as Toronto Star reporter Daniel Dale points out, then-FBI Director James Comey gave her credit, too.\n\nIn fact, the video plainly shows that Wilson credited both Republican and Democratic lawmakers with speeding up what is normally a tedious and prolonged process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKelly got it all the way wrong, but it should come as no surprise that the White House is sticking by its version of events, according to The Hill. As a matter of fact, the White House is doubling down.\n\n\u201cGen. Kelly said he was \u2018stunned\u2019 that Rep. Wilson made comments at a building dedication honoring slain FBI agents about her own actions in Congress, including lobbying former President Obama on legislation,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said.\n\n\u201cAs Gen. Kelly pointed out, if you\u2019re able to make a sacred act like honoring American heroes about yourself, you\u2019re an empty barrel,\u201d Sanders continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the White House has no damn business entering a conversation about what\u2019s sacred or what\u2019s honorable.\n\nThis administration has persistently targeted and denigrated black women\u2014a pattern underscored by its repeated \u201cempty barrel\u201d insults aimed at Wilson.\n\nAs Jamelle Bouie of Slate notes, in the last 9 months, Trump\u2019s White House has called for the head of ESPN anchor Jemelle Hill for calling the president a white supremacist. Journalist April Ryan and Congresswoman Maxine Waters have also come into the administration\u2019s crosshairs, as did former national security adviser Susan Rice for \u201cunmasking\u201d Trump officials following the election. Now, the White House has waged war against Wilson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be clear, Kelly didn\u2019t just completely misrepresent Wilson\u2019s behavior and words. In calling her an empty barrel, he was calling her loud and stupid.\n\nNot only is that about as mean-spirited a remark as a man in his position could make about a fellow public servant, but it also follows a long American tradition of dismissing black women by insulting their intelligence and their value. Kelly implied that Wilson has no business speaking up so loudly, so vociferously, because she\u2019s \u201cempty,\u201d which is to say, unworthy. It was for her he saved his most vitriolic comments\u2014saying nothing of the president he serves, the dotard who politicized the entire event to begin with when he compared his outreach to military families with Obama\u2019s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLest we forget, it was Trump who dragged Kelly and his son\u2019s death into this news cycle. And yet it was Wilson whom Kelly attacked with the ferocity of a frothing pitbull. It was she whom Kelly tried to paint as a self-promoting narcissist.\n\nIt\u2019s worth remembering that Sgt. La David Johnson\u2019s death first drew attention because of the questionable circumstances surrounding it\u2014an issue that Wilson continues to raise even as her enemies try to drag her down.\n\n\u201cMy emphasis today is on my constituents and helping them lay our hero to rest,\u201d the congresswoman told CNN on Friday morning. \u201cThat\u2019s where my head is today. I\u2019m also concerned about [Johnson] and his last moments. I want to know why he was separated from the rest of the soldiers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhy did it take 48 hours to find him? Was he still alive? Was he kidnapped? What\u2019s going on?\u201d Wilson continued. \u201cI am distraught and so is the family. There are so many questions that should be answered.\u201d\n\nWilson\u2014not Kelly, and certainly not Trump\u2014is the only public servant who is truly fighting for Johnson right now. The only one who\u2019s treating the fallen soldier\u2019s life as if it were sacred.

Listen, when Living Single debuted in August of \u201993, I knew immediately that I wanted to be Khadijah James (played by Queen Latifah). She had my dream job (editor of a hip-hop magazine), lived in my dream city (New York City) and dressed exactly how I wanted to dress.\n\nKhadijah was just the right amount of butch, with a cool, relaxed streetwear feel. I longed for the many African-American College Alliance sweatshirts, hoodies, T-shirts and hats that filled her closet. Plus, Queen Latifah is a curvy woman, so I felt like she rocked styles that would also work for me. I imagined that her wardrobe of tailored suits with the colorful vests underneath would fit me perfectly!\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nI spent most of the \u201980s tuned into pop, vintage soul and hair bands, with most hip-hop on my periphery. But late-\u201980s new jack swing caught my attention, as artists started sampling, remaking and covering my beloved old-school soul and R&B artists. In 1992, when Dr. Dre dropped The Chronic, I recognized the rhythms from my childhood escapes into my pop\u2019s record collection.\n\nG-funk lifted the beauty of the bass, synth and live instrumental tracks of Parliament-Funkadelic to combine it with deep 808s. I would often point out to my friends that I\u2019d already introduced them to the music they were bumping out of their speakers; and as the lyricism got tighter and R&B increased its flirtation with hip-hop, I found myself falling for not only the music but also the fashion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the \u201990s, I was too broke to afford the clothes I wanted to wear. I was often underemployed and occasionally more worried about housing than clothing; but flipping through the Source magazine, I\u2019d envision myself rocking Timberlands and Tommy Hilfiger with baggy jeans. I wanted to wear my hair in braids and sport baseball caps and bubble coats or Starter jackets. I couldn\u2019t buy Air Force 1s, but I spent a lot of time just drooling over them in Foot Locker.\n\nWhen Higher Learning hit theaters in 1995, I had my first real date with a woman. I\u2019d had a girlfriend years before, but we were so closeted we moved through our own internalized homophobia as \u201cbest friends.\u201d Higher Learning helped evolve not only my political consciousness but also my sense of style. I envied Busta\u2019s dreads (my hair could never do that) and may not have had Cube\u2019s Chucks, but seeing both of them on-screen helped push my relationship with my gender expression forward.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the time the film Set It Off premiered a year later, I\u2019d just finished reading the classic novel Stone Butch Blues, by the late Leslie Feinberg. I was finally attempting to figure out my gender expression and how I wanted to present to the world. Feinberg\u2019s novel felt like a revelation to me and finally gave me an identity to aspire to: butch.\n\nBack then, I didn\u2019t have much of an idea what \u201cbutch\u201d meant except through the lens of that book, so I began to fashion\u2014at least in my mind\u2014what that meant for me. When I saw Set It Off, I fell completely in love with the image of another iconic Latifah character, Cleo. I, too, wanted to be stone butch with a badass, blond-\u2019fro-rocking black femme by my side.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Love Jones rolled around in 1997, I was hanging out in chat rooms and connecting with a world of black lesbians. I\u2019d firmly established myself as a stud, and aspired to be a spoken-word artist. I devoured that movie, believing that it painted an accurate picture of black, middle-class life in Chicago\u2014my new dream city.\n\n\n\nI loved Love Jones and its romance with culture and music and poetry. The leather jackets and boots felt reminiscent of the \u201970s, while the blue tones of the cinematography felt simultaneously familiar and fresh, like a new jack Gordon Parks photo album. I imagined myself being as cool as the film\u2019s hero, Darius, and while Nia Long\u2019s Nina was beautiful, I wanted to fall in love with Lisa Nicole Carson.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of these pop-cultural touchstones exposed me to a range of black aesthetics. The beauty of \u201990s fashion was its fluidity, the way it brought together the masculine and the feminine. In many ways, women were able to play with gender norms and identity by poaching clothes from their boyfriends, male cousins, brothers or friends, adding feminine touches like bamboo earrings or large hoops (I\u2019ve always been a hoop boi).\n\nI spent the \u201990s in search of what being butch/stud/masculine of center meant to me. My own emerging style was heavily influenced not only by seeing us on-screen but by up-and-coming black-owned brands like FUBU, Sean John and Phat Farm\u2014brands that highlighted the reality that hip-hop had long moved out of New York City\u2019s South Bronx and was on its way to becoming a global commodity.\n\nBut I often wonder when the shift happened in women\u2019s clothing. Back in the \u201990s, it felt like there was a range of female expression\u2014from Lil\u2019 Kim and Foxy Brown to Queen Latifah and Lauryn Hill. The women of Bad Boy famously cultivated a femme-aggressive look, mixing hard and soft together. When did women stop being able to rock a hoodie and baggy jeans and still be considered sexy? When did fashion for women become more about how much skin we\u2019re showing?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe it\u2019s always been that way, and I\u2019d just rather remember it differently.\n\nWhile there are definitely some fashions we should leave in the \u201990s (backward clothing, Cross Colours, shiny leather suits\u2014or really any leather suits\u2014and patchwork jeans), the \u201990s were a decade of revolutionary style. Aside from helping a young stud find her way, it was an era that helped a generation of Xers make a mark on a world eager to ignore them\u2014with swag to spare.", "keywords": ["living", "butch", "90s", "single", "wanted", "felt", "latifah", "shaped", "love", "style", "jones", "hiphop", "way", "id", "women"], "polarity": 0.17467765209700697, "subjectivity": 0.47019852906949694},

Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.), who has been especially critical of Donald Trump for the remarks he made to Myeshia Johnson, the pregnant widow of U.S. Army Sgt. La David Johnson.\n\nSgt. Johnson was killed in action Oct. 4 in Niger when his group was ambushed by what are being described as 50 Islamic militants armed with rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns.\n\nWilson was present when Johnson\u2019s widow received a call from Trump, and she said that over a speakerphone, she heard him tell Myeshia Johnson that her husband \u201cknew what he signed up for.\u201d Wilson has denounced the president\u2019s remarks in the press, calling them insensitive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring his remarks Thursday, Kelly said that Trump \u201cexpressed his condolences in the best way that he could.\u201d\n\nKelly said of Johnson the same thing that he said his casualty officer told him about his own son who died in combat: \u201cHe knew what he was getting himself into because he enlisted. There\u2019s no reason to enlist. He enlisted, and he was where he wanted to be\u2014exactly where he wanted to be with exactly the people he wanted to be with when his life was taken.\u201d\n\nKelly said it was this message that Trump was trying to convey to Johnson\u2019s widow in his own way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was stunned when I came to work yesterday morning and brokenhearted at what I saw a member of Congress doing,\u201d Kelly said, referencing Wilson. \u201cA member of Congress who listened in on a phone call from the president of the United States to a young wife and in his way tried to express that opinion that he\u2019s a brave man, a fallen hero.\n\n\u201cIt stuns me that a member of Congress would have listened in on that conversation. Absolutely stuns me.

Johnson\u2019s name, so for Kelly to direct his outrage at a congresswoman who is simply sticking up for a widow who she feels was slighted and insulted seems a little over the top.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Trump meant to say and what he actually said are two different things. Kelly himself said during the briefing that he had advised Trump not to make the calls, saying that neither President Barack Obama nor President George W. Bush called families in every case, and Trump should have heeded that advice. He has demonstrated time and time again that he is incapable of sticking to the script.\n\nAnd while Trump got on Twitter on Wednesday and accused Wilson of fabricating what he said, at no point did Kelly refute her version of the events.

I accept full responsibility for my actions.\n\nYes, he did invoke his military service and his faith in God.\n\nClearly, former FBI Director James Comey was not going to let that slide, because he sent out the most epic subtweet, complete with biblical-Scripture quote:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the accompanying Instagram post shows us just how deep Comey\u2019s petty runs:\n\nAs has been said many times this morning already, this finna be good.\n\nEarlier:\n\nMichael Flynn, the former national security adviser to Donald Trump, pleaded guilty Friday to charges of lying to the FBI about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador last December during the presidential transition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Times reports that Flynn made an appearance in a federal court in Washington, D.C., as part of a plea deal that inches special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election just a bit closer to Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle.\n\nFlynn lasted only 24 days as national security adviser before being forced to resign after it was revealed that he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russian officials during the presidential transition.\n\nSo did he really lie to Pence, or was Pence also complicit? Is Jared Kushner now dangling in the wind? Could Flynn be preparing to testify against the president himself?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe charges Flynn pleaded guilty to Friday morning amount to a veritable slap on the wrist in comparison with all the evidence stacked against him, and they are nothing compared with the charges faced by another Trump associate, Paul Manafort.\n\nManafort was charged with conspiracy against the United States, to which he pleaded not guilty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo the question is, with Flynn pleading guilty to this light-as-a-feather charge, what is he getting\u2014and giving\u2014in exchange?\n\nThere is no way Mueller is granting plea deals for small fish. Flynn has to be dropping the goods on someone big\u2014maybe more than one someone.\n\nThis is also a clear indication that Mueller\u2019s team was able to flip Flynn, but not Manafort. Manafort took his lumps, pleaded not guilty to the charges and now waits to see what happens next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlynn, on the other hand, was apparently as nervous as a sow at a North Carolina pig-pulling when it became clear that the investigators would stop at nothing to get to the dirt, even if it meant taking his son Michael G. Flynn down with him.\n\nHe was ready to sing, but which song did he pick?\n\nMy money is on the Kushner-Pence-Trump trifecta. For as smug as Pence is, you know he had to know a lot. He did not operate in that campaign in the dark. He is just as complicit as his boss and his boss\u2019s puppet of a son-in-law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we are lucky, Donald Trump Jr. will go down, too.\n\nAt this point, Michael Flynn is Nino Brown to the bullshit, and I\u2019m here for it. \u201cIf I\u2019m going down, I\u2019m taking all y\u2019all with me.\u201d\n\nSing, Michael Flynn. Sing. Sing until you can\u2019t sing no more.\n\nWe need to flush the toilet on this administration and power-wash the White House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only way to do that is to get everyone out first.\n\nRead more at the New York Times.", "keywords": ["sing", "flynn", "james", "pence", "trump", "charges", "responds", "pleaded", "guilty", "pleading", "michael", "times", "lying", "releases", "russian", "subtweet", "statement"], "polarity": 0.015477855477855481, "subjectivity": 0.45993839493839483},

Bannon was asked specific questions that had been negotiated between the White House and the House\u2019s lead counsel.\n\nBannon had been subpoenaed by the committee on Jan. 16 but managed to postpone the subpoena deadline three times as the White House and House lawyers negotiated which questions he could answer without the White House invoking executive privilege to prevent him from testifying.\n\nDemocrat Rep. Adam Schiff of California, ranking member of the committee, told reporters: \u201cThe only questions he would answer were questions that had been scripted, literally scripted for him by the White House. Whenever we sought to probe anything beyond the four corners of the specific wording of the question, he refused to answer. That\u2019s not how executive privilege works.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, lawmakers said that continued noncooperation on Bannon\u2019s part could result in the committee taking steps to hold him in contempt of Congress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe claims of executive privilege will be looked into by committee member Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), who said that he will work with House Speaker Paul Ryan and House lawyers to determine whether contempt proceedings would be appropriate.\n\nSo the White House was able to script what Bannon told the House Intelligence Committee, but it wasn\u2019t able to do that for Bannon\u2019s meetings with Mueller.\n\nWhich leaves us to wonder what Bannon may have told Mueller. Did he roll over on his former friend and boss? The way he slobbered on the mic for Michael Wolff for the freeski would lead one to believe that under fear of some type of legal recourse against him, he may have done the same with Mueller.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, to be a fly on the wall for that.\n\nI need Mueller to drop the bomb already. We\u2019ve been waiting long enough. Yes, I want the investigation to be thorough and to yield the type of fruit that might help us get Trump out of here, but I also want them to hurry the hell up.\n\nEnough is enough.\n\nSo, what do you think Bannon spilled the beans on?

Collins was rushed to a local hospital with a stab wound to the chest and was later pronounced dead.\n\nFrom NBC 4 Washington:\n\nCourt documents obtained by News4 say Collins was waiting for the university\u2019s shuttle bus with his friends when they realized the shuttle bus had stopped running for the night. The three decided to call an Uber and were waiting for one to arrive when they heard Urbanski screaming nearby, the documents said. Collins and his friends watched Urbanski as he approached them.

And then there\u2019s the story of Col. Charles Young.\n\nIn 1917, when the United States entered World War I, Charles Young, the son of former slaves, was the Army\u2019s highest-ranking black officer. He was the only serving black officer who was a West Point graduate, and the third black man to ever graduate from the school. He served all over the world, leading men\u2014both black and white\u2014in and out of danger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet the Army still wouldn\u2019t promote him to the rank of brigadier general because that would mean he\u2019d be in charge of Southern white men. Even President Woodrow Wilson got involved, knowing Young was one of the best soldiers in the entire military but hesitant about allowing him to outrank white soldiers.\n\nThe president, Congress and the secretary of war privately wondered what to do about the \u201cCharles Young question.\u201d Eventually the Department of War decided to say Charles Young was not healthy enough to serve, forcing the greatest black soldier in the armed forces to retire during wartime.\n\nThat is how America solves its \u201cblack\u201d problems.\n\nWhen President Donald Trump called the family of Army Sgt. La David Johnson, the Green Beret who gave his life in Niger, Trump reportedly told Johnson\u2019s widow, \u201cHe knew what he signed up for.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump denies that version of the conversation, but Cowanda Jones-Johnson, the sergeant\u2019s mother, affirmed the account of the call and said: \u201cPresident Trump did disrespect my son and my daughter and also me and my husband,\u201d according to the Washington Post.\n\nThere are other soldiers who haven\u2019t heard from Trump. The Root can confirm that there are at least three soldiers who gave their lives for their country without acknowledgment from their commander in chief.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoshaine Brooks, an African-American sergeant in the Army, was killed in action on Aug. 13, 2017. His family is waiting for a call or a letter, even though Trump says he has reached out to the families of all slain servicemen.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s lying. He didn\u2019t contact us,\u201d Brooks\u2019 father, Unvince Brooks, told the New York Daily News. \u201cNobody from the White House cares about my family and our grief. If they cared, they would say something to us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpc. Isaiah Booker\u2019s family say they received a letter but no call from Trump after Booker was killed in Jordan.\n\nThe mother of Army Spc. Etienne Murphy, who was killed in Syria, says that she wrote to Trump six weeks ago to tell him she was \u201cdeeply grieving,\u201d but she has yet to hear anything from the White House, according to the Chicago Tribune.\n\nThis is the way America has always treated black soldiers. It has always sucked them dry and used the meat from their carcasses to feed freedom. The black soldier is the most disrespected, unheralded pillar propping up the tent that protects this country\u2019s freedoms. Black soldiers are a perennial footnote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the time the rebellious spirits of the Founding Fathers finally said, \u201cFuck this\u201d and decided to puff out their chests by writing a letter to King George III of England, declaring the independence of the United States of America, Crispus Attucks had already given his life in what was called \u201cthe Incident on King Street.\u201d The incident would later become known as the event that kicked off the American Revolution and called the \u201cBoston Massacre.\u201d\n\nWhen America descended into the Civil War, the Union was preserved in part by the 209,145 black soldiers who helped defeat the Confederate States of America and end the American holocaust of slavery. The country has actually honored those soldiers with the African American Civil War Memorial in Washington, D.C.\n\nIt was erected in 1998.\n\nThe first group of soldiers to arrive in France in World War I was the 269th Infantry, known as the Harlem Hellcats. They spent more days in combat than any other regiment and never lost a man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn outsized number of African Americans have served in every war since the U.S. military was integrated in 1948. According to Pew Research, in 2015 (the latest year for which statistics are available), 19 percent of active-duty men and women in the military were African American, while blacks make up just 13 percent of the U.S. population.\n\nTrump\u2019s treatment of the family of fallen soldier Johnson, who was African American, is not only a reflection of a pattern of the man who once said of Sen. John McCain\u2019s stint as a prisoner of war: \u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero. He\u2019s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren\u2019t captured.\u201d\n\nIt is not simply the sentiment of a man who equivocates about \u201cboth sides\u201d regarding white supremacist terrorists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not another isolated incident from a guy who called NFL players \u201csons of bitches.\u201d\n\nIt is America.\n\nSoldiers don\u2019t fight for recognition, but America never recognizes black heroes. There are no movies or mentions of buffalo soldiers. Textbooks don\u2019t tell the tale of the Tuskegee Airmen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the country that turned Colin Powell into a punching bag. It drinks black blood and pisses out red, white and blue.\n\nWhen the Army declared Charles Young unfit for duty, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s time for my people\u2014my brethren\u2014to know that I am physically fit.\u201d Then he packed a bag, put on his uniform and\u2014in a move that would have killed much younger men\u2014the 54-year-old rode his horse 500 miles from Xenia, Ohio, to Washington, D.C.\n\nWhen he reached Washington, D.C., he marched into the office of the secretary of war, who had no choice but to reinstate Young. But he never gave Col. Young the generalship he deserved. Instead, he sent him to train other black soldiers, and then to West Africa, where Young eventually died.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat is America.\n\nWhen we address the ignored families of dead black soldiers, we should remember the words of W.E.B. Du Bois, who chastised the country\u2019s treatment of a great war hero, Col. Charles Young:\n\n\u201cGod rest Col.

His \u201cTear down this wall\u201d speech at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin on June 12, 1987, is remembered for its symbolism and defiance as well as Reagan\u2019s robust behind-the-scenes diplomacy. (Of course, Reagan\u2019s other policies in general were horrible, but that is another story.)\n\nRepublicans today herald Reagan as the guardian who stood up against Soviet aggression and a symbol of the Republican Party\u2019s hawkish foreign policy against Moscow. But it is obvious that the reputation Reagan cultivated for his party is under threat by Donald Trump, a Republican president who many believe is in cahoots with the Kremlin. Not only is there a special investigation into whether Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russia to win the 2016 presidential election, but Trump\u2019s attempts to cozy up to Vladimir Putin are doing little to ease those concerns.\n\nBefore and during his campaign for president, Trump lamented that former President Barack Obama was weak on Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine and Syria. During a videoconference call to a high-profile annual conference in Kiev, Ukraine, in September of 2015, Trump said, \u201cOur president is not strong\u2014so far all we have is lip service,\u201d adding, \u201cPart of the problem that Ukraine has with the United States is that Putin does not respect our president whatsoever.\u201d In 2016, Trump tweeted about Obama\u2019s lack of strength against Russia over Ukraine.\n\nInterestingly, though, Trump has essentially failed to stand up to Russia\u2019s meddling in European elections or, for that matter, our own elections. Trump\u2019s lack of enthusiasm for blasting the Kremlin is obvious\u2014I mean, Putin helped him win the White House\u2014but that should not stop Republicans from attacking Trump with the same zeal as they did Obama\u2014if, of course, they really are Russia hawks.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), one of Obama\u2019s sharpest critics, wrote in the National Review that Obama needed to reverse his \u201cpolicy of weakness\u201d against Russia over Syria. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said in April 2014 that Obama\u2019s refusal to grant Ukraine critical defensive weapons was \u201canother sign of weakness\u201d in Putin\u2019s eyes. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told CNN that Obama was \u201cweak and indecisive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFast-forward several years later, and we have Trump, who has yet to grant Ukraine defensive weapons, failing to punish Russia for arguably the greatest attack against U.S. democracy in American history or criticize Putin for what many human rights organizations say is Russia\u2019s bombing of civilian targets in Syria.\n\nThe lack of criticism from the Republican Party for Trump\u2019s handling of Russian aggression is just as apparent. There was plenty of room to criticize Obama for his response to Putin\u2019s geopolitical chess match in Europe and elsewhere, but Trump? Not so much.\n\nSure, he is the GOP\u2019s president, but does party loyalty rank higher than allowing Trump to stand down against Putin\u2019s geopolitical aggression, which has only intensified over the past year? That appears to be the case. Has McCain, Rubio or Graham called Trump weak even once? I Googled and actually found Russian officials calling Trump \u201cweak.\u201d Ironic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObama\u2019s stance against Russia may have been slow, and his understanding of Moscow\u2019s motives may have left much to be desired, but in light of the Trump campaign\u2019s possible collusion with the Kremlin, Obama, comparatively speaking, looks like the real hawk.\n\nObama\u2019s economic sanctions helped force Russia\u2019s economy to contract by 3.7 percent in 2015. In addition, key drilling projects were forced to shut down as a result. Naturally, Ukraine and U.S. Russia hawks wanted more, but the devastating impact of the Obama administration\u2019s action was hardly weak.\n\nOn the other hand, the Republican response to the Russian collusion scandal has been very weak. When then-acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified in May that ex-national security adviser Mike Flynn may have been compromised by Russia, GOP senators were more concerned about who leaked the story to the media than gathering information about Flynn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepublicans also pushed back against former FBI Director James Comey during his June testimony when he said Trump fired him because of his handling of the Russia investigation. House Speaker Paul Ryan brushed off Comey\u2019s claims by saying Trump was \u201cjust new to this\u201d and didn\u2019t understand protocol.\n\nI doubt Obama would have been afforded the same pass, especially since McCain once said during a 2008 debate that the presidency doesn\u2019t allow time for \u201con-the-job training.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s Republicans are showing their true colors. They do not care about defending America against Moscow. During the presidential campaign, the GOP cared about votes, something that was obvious from Trump\u2019s base, which clearly didn\u2019t care about Russian meddling as long as it helped Hillary Clinton lose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne Trump supporter told the New York Times, \u201cIf that\u2019s what it took, I\u2019m glad they did it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, American democracy is being taken to the sunken place by a Congress and a White House full of doves.", "keywords": ["trumps", "trump", "russias", "russia", "look", "ukraine", "fake", "weak", "republican", "hawks", "russian", "gop", "obama", "president", "making"], "polarity": 0.020474241594931254, "subjectivity": 0.44415667346701815},

It would clear up speculation that the Knavses used their son-in-law\u2019s executive privilege to usurp the system, as he\u2019s been known to do. Not only would clarification as to their status be helpful, but it would also seem like the right thing to do given that this administration drew a hard line in the sand over immigration and then built a wall around the line and didn\u2019t get Mexico to pay for it.\n\nAccording to the New York Daily News, while speculation surrounds the president\u2019s in-laws, he continues to ramp up his war on immigrants:\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement announced just this week that they made 40% more arrests in general within President Trump\u2019s first year compared to 2016. ICE claims to have taken 37,734 \u201cnon-criminal\u201d immigrants \u2014 people who don\u2019t have criminal records or those who might face charges \u2014 into custody. That number is more than double the amount of non-criminal arrests made in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this is Donald Trump we\u2019re talking about, so would it surprise any of us if we were to find out one day that Trump sent a Russian spy jet to pick up his in-laws and bring them to the United States? Nope.

The announcements came after many users, including The Root\u2019s Monique Judge, raised hell when Twitter gave a blue check mark to Jason Kessler, a white nationalist who helped plan the pro-Confederacy march in August in Charlottesville, Va.\n\n\n\nWhile Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and his workers ruminated on the company\u2019s account-verification policies, I decided it was a good time for black people to pause and think about our relationship with Twitter and other social media and technology companies. We voluntarily \u201ccontribute\u201d our creative insights, dollars and labor to the success of these companies by buying devices and apps, uploading memes, ideas and language that trend widely. Yet in terms of the vast wealth these companies hold, disburse to employees and generate for shareholders, we get little in return.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThink of the recent moment when top lawyers for Google and its parent company, Alphabet, along with Twitter and Facebook, were summoned to Capitol Hill to testify before Senate and House committees looking into the company\u2019s role in disseminating toxic content and ads during the 2016 presidential election cycle.\n\nI shared the congressional investigators\u2019 agita\u2014and the pointed through line of their questioning: How did we get to the point where tech seems to be drowning American democracy? How could the educated, experienced \u201ctechnologists\u201d who built and run these companies have missed the Russians\u2019 insidious gaming of their platforms?\n\nI think there\u2019s one big reason among several that led to the companies\u2019 obliviousness: The tech industry is nearly wholly centered in an exclusionary bubble of white men who finance, develop and market the platforms and applications. The same biases that led to the development of social media startups built on algorithms that enable racial profiling (like NextDoor), or that inform court decisions resulting in blacks and Latinos receiving unduly harsh sentences (like COMPAS), played a role in the Russians\u2019 stealthy misinformation campaigns on Facebook, Instagram, Google and Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnti-black messaging was the secret sauce of many of the pro-Trump, nationalist memes and messages that flooded through the popular social media channels during the 2016 election cycle. Yet somehow, the gatekeepers at Facebook and Twitter didn\u2019t seem to notice the methodical manipulation of racial animus that already exists in America\u2014specifically, some white Americans\u2019 negative opinions of blacks.\n\nThe leaders and staffs of Twitter, Facebook and other popular social media platforms missed the Russians\u2019 exploitation of the black-white divide, an obliviousness that has precedent: Black women who use Twitter had long alerted the platform\u2019s officials to the abusive conduct of other users, up to and including death threats. The hashtag #YourSlipIsShowing catalogs such experiences from black women dating back several years and is readily available ... at least to those interested in learning about and addressing these kinds of user experiences.\n\nBut clearly, the tech-company leaders were not inclined to pay attention to this area of user complaints, a strong indication that they also probably weren\u2019t interested in the views of the few black and Latinx workers at their companies, either. Just look at what happened to Leslie Miley, a black former engineer at Twitter. Miley revealed in a recent interview that he had flagged tons of dubious accounts in 2015, telling his bosses that he believed they were from Ukraine or Russia and that they appeared to be part of a coordinated campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiley was told by his bosses at Twitter to \u201cstay in his lane,\u201d a response that Miley says he took as a sign that the company leadership preferred to err on the side of \u201cgrowth numbers\u201d rather than on any potential harm to audiences that the bots might pose.\n\nMeanwhile, black users of Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Google products infuse them with a deep coolness factor that resonates around the world. Our intellectual property and creativity is the lifeboat that floats these companies to revenue solvency, yet few of us share in the enormous economic wealth generated by these companies, not even after dozens of news stories, industry conferences and activists\u2019 complaints forced the companies to pledge to improve hiring and retention.\n\n\n\nThe history of black-white tension in America was a major flashpoint manipulated by the GOP during the presidential campaign (not for the first time), and the Russia-controlled bots capitalized on whites\u2019 fears of and disdain for black Americans. This exploitation has been documented by federal investigators, as well as media, including Terrell J. Starr here at The Root and at other news outlets.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet the owners, leaders and staffs at the tech companies did not seem to notice or care about the implications of the sneaky manipulation while it happened in real time. The incredible whiteness of their leaderships and staffs is akin to, but far worse than, that of the news industry (which is significant). And the companies\u2019 whiteness is a big reason they missed the infiltration of these divisive messages and tribal calls to action during the 2016 presidential election cycle.\n\nBlack Americans know when something smells rotten, including the kinds of scams and shady b.s. that can unfold at one\u2019s job. And, as usual, blacks and other marginalized communities have solutions. We have the brainpower, problem-solving acumen and moral fortitude to right the ship of state.\n\nThe question is whether our concerns and advice will be heeded and whether we can achieve full access to the genuine levers of power in the United States, including access to quality education, health care, voting and, most importantly in the context of the innovation ecosystem, investment capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you regularly shout out Chance the Rapper or Ava via the \u2019gram, or post your hair-braiding tutorials on YouTube or Amazon.com commercial verticals and cash the resulting PayPal deposits accordingly, you are well within your rights to hold these companies accountable and question the political and economic structures that gave these companies ready access to us, their most valuable cultural assets. Our fixating on the blue check mark of verification should be the least of it.\n\n\n\nWhile there certainly are rough seas and shimmering mirages all around, I do see promise and opportunity in the amazing tech discoveries and innovations that enter the marketplace daily. I also see a future in which blacks and other historically marginalized creators and entrepreneurs more powerfully leverage their advantages in service of owning these technologies.\n\n\n\nRight now we\u2019re swimming in amazing discoveries, yet drowning in age-old belief systems and tribalism that effectively cancel out far-ranging benefits of the powerful machines that increasingly shape our experiences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is up to us see to it that tech is built and used to positively tell our stories, support our causes and policies, and shape our destinies.", "keywords": ["tech", "techs", "black", "media", "whiteness", "users", "twitter", "solution", "including", "social", "facebook", "white", "problem", "companies"], "polarity": 0.09615543186971759, "subjectivity": 0.40157366443080733},

And you have to listen to him also.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, the president himself has been accused 19 times of sexual harassment and sexual abuse\u2014claims that he and the White House have labeled \u201cfake news.\u201d His administration\u2019s policies do not show any amount of care for women who are victims, either. In fact, before he even took office, his team proposed eliminating the Justice Department\u2019s violence-against-women grant programs that allocate funds to organizations that deal with sexual assault and domestic abuse.\n\nAs a woman, I\u2019m not sure how Suckabee reconciles her staunch defense of the president and his bullshit in the wake of the #MeToo movement. That she could stand at that podium and give that bullshit-ass statement is sickening. She knows what her boss has said publicly (more than once!) when it comes to accused abusers, and she continues to defend him anyway. It\u2019s gross.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s obvious the president doesn\u2019t care about victims of domestic violence. He\u2019s made that clear.\n\nThe somewhat shocking reveal here is that maybe Suckabee doesn\u2019t care, either.\n\nAnd that\u2019s sad.", "keywords": ["supports", "victims", "huckabee", "trump", "statements", "sarah", "sanders", "tweets", "white", "house", "violence", "domestic", "say", "president", "allegations", "sexual"], "polarity": 0.035624403844742844, "subjectivity": 0.4193398879839558},

His father was a student at my elementary school; I was his principal. For [Trump] to say that this young man, [who] stayed in school, did all the right things, went into the service, became a sergeant so quickly\u2014that he signed up for his own death? That is so insensitive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilson told CNN that after Trump\u2019s comments, Myeshia broke down crying.\n\nIf Wilson\u2019s account is true\u2014and she maintains that it is\u2014it appears y\u2019all\u2019s president was so obsessed with the patriotism of NFL players and the respect they show for the country that he forgot to learn a fallen soldier\u2019s name.\n\nTrump refuted Wilson\u2019s version of events, tweeting that the \u201cDemocrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said\u201d and claiming he had \u201cproof\u201d of the matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrankly, it looks like he may not know Wilson\u2019s name, either, but I\u2019ll just leave that there for the moment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s tone-deaf remarks have prompted people to donate to a fund for the Johnson children. Michael Skolnik, co-founder of the Soze Agency, issued a call on Twitter this morning to raise $5,000 for a scholarship fund for the family, which now has raised more than $300,000.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to be blithe about Trump\u2019s tweets, his self-absorption, his coarseness, his uncanny ability to make himself the star of every story. And just when you think you\u2019ve gotten used to it\u2014that you\u2019ve exhausted your disbelief\u2014Trump challenges you with yet another low.

Guess who showed up at the restaurant I was at. I recognized them as soon as they walked in, and I wondered if anyone else there knew. These guys, maybe 20 of them, dressed in all black, paraded through to an adjoining room, and immediately started harassing a biracial couple there.

As she told Newsweek in 2017:\n\nWhat I do now, when I\u2019m taking on a film, I always ask about the fairness of the pay. I ask what they\u2019re offering me in comparison to the guy. I don\u2019t care about how much I get paid; I\u2019m in an industry where we\u2019re overcompensated for the work we do. But I don\u2019t want to be on a set where I\u2019m doing the same work as someone else and they\u2019re getting five times what I\u2019m getting.\n\nSo when Chastain approached Oscar-winning actress Octavia Spencer about doing a holiday comedy with her (the two first appeared together in 2011\u2019s The Help), the discussion naturally turned to the gender wage gap. But what Chastain wasn\u2019t prepared for was the wage gap she\u2019d yet to consider: how much less actresses of color make than their white counterparts.\n\nGood friend Spencer quickly brought her up to speed\u2014a conversation she recounted last week while on the Women Breaking Barriers panel at the Sundance Film Festival (Spencer\u2019s revelation begins at the 19:30 mark):\n\nWomen Breaking Barriers panel at Sundance 2018 (Golden Globes/YouTube screenshot)\n\nWe were dropping f-bombs and getting it all out there. And then I said, \u201cBut here\u2019s the thing: Women of color on that spectrum, we make far less than white women. So if we\u2019re gonna have that conversation about pay equity, we gotta bring the women of color to the table.\u201d And I told her my story, and we talked numbers, and she was quiet, and she said she had no idea that that\u2019s what it was like for women of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChastain did more than listen; she committed to bringing her new knowledge to the negotiating table, brokering what she called a \u201cfavored nations\u201d deal. As Spencer recalls:\n\nShe said: \u201cOctavia, we\u2019re gonna get you paid on this film. You and I are gonna be tied together. We\u2019re gonna be favored nations, and we\u2019re gonna make the same thing.\u201d\n\nChastain\u2019s negotiations sparked a bidding war for the film, which will be produced by Chastain and released by Universal Pictures, and resulted in salaries five times higher than what was initially offered, making Spencer\u2019s salary as an actor equal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Chastain told Business Insider in 2016:\n\nWe really need to look at ourselves and say we need to reevaluate this. We need to reevaluate women who ask for a pay raise or ask for a promotion. It\u2019s actually an okay thing. It\u2019s okay to be ambitious, it\u2019s okay to be over-prepared.\n\nIt may be the type of story that for some will evoke tropes of the \u201cwhite savior,\u201d or the much overused (and often misunderstood) term \u201cwhite allies.\u201d But for Spencer, it\u2019s simply an example of how true allies can effectively use their privilege for positive change: \u201cI love that woman, because she\u2019s walking the walk and she\u2019s actually talking the talk.\u201d", "keywords": ["ask", "told", "im", "film", "chastain", "jessica", "worth", "helped", "earn", "gonna", "white", "pay", "octavia", "spencer", "women", "privilege"], "polarity": 0.2190909090909091, "subjectivity": 0.3655952380952381},

This week, Facebook revealed to our parent company, Fusion Media, that Russia-related content ran on two of our sites: Splinter (formerly Fusion) and here at The Root.\n\nEven though Russia is known for having some of the best hackers and bots in the world (I still don\u2019t know what a \u201cbot\u201d is. Is it a robot with an amputated leg? Is it a boy thot?), apparently the Soviet propaganda could only generate side eye from our readers. Even though The Root has 1.2 million followers on Facebook, only a small percentage of the Russian ads made impressions.\n\nFacebook defines \u201cimpressions\u201d as \u201cthe moment an ad enters the screen of a desktop browser or mobile app. If an ad doesn\u2019t enter the screen, we don\u2019t count it as an ad impression.\u201d I haven\u2019t verified the numbers, but I assume only a few thousand of our readers took the Kremlin-backed bait. Hold on, let me check.\n\nOK, I just messaged our social media editor Aarick Knighton. He said only three thousand ... wait. No, just three people? That can\u2019t be right. Let me double-check that figure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYep, just three people saw the Russian ads. Three. That\u2019s it.\n\nWe all know how hard it is for advertisers to reach black audiences, especially when there are white people making the decisions (see SheaMoisture, Pepsi, Dove, et al.). We thought we\u2019d help Facebook, Russia and other advertisers who wanted to reach The Root\u2019s audience by sharing a few ideas that we know would attract attention.\n\n1. Beyonc\u00e9 or Rihanna\n\nIf Facebook ran an ad saying Beyonc\u00e9 was voting for Trump, I\u2019m sure the Beyhive vote would have been worth five or six electoral votes, minimum. Even better, if they had said that every person who pulled the lever for the cantaloupe-colored colluder got a Fenty gift bag, it would have been a landslide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Wypipo\n\nContrary to popular belief, not all The Root\u2019s readers are black. Sometimes Caucasians click on our stories to shed their daily dose of white tears (I\u2019m pretty sure it is a weight-loss technique). And nothing gets the white tears flowing like the word \u201cwypipo.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re selling lotion or Confederate flags. If a headline contains the word, they will click on it.\n\nThen they\u2019ll write the company a letter about how racist their lotion is.\n\n3. Barack and Michelle Obama\n\nLet\u2019s try a quick experiment: Find a random black woman\u2019s Facebook page and scroll through her pictures. I guarantee one of them is a photo of Barack, Michelle or both Obamas. In fact, a 2016 Pew Research poll that was never conducted shows that 83.5 percent of black women\u2019s cellphones have a photograph of the Obamas, only slightly lower than the 94.2 percent who have an unsolicited picture of a penis in their \u201cdeleted photos\u201d folders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Black Lives Matter\n\nLike the word \u201cwypipo,\u201d Caucasians are compelled to click on anything that says #BlackLivesMatter just so they can comment, \u201cShouldn\u2019t all lives matter?\u201d\n\n5. Black Men in Gray Sweatpants\n\nApparently this is a thing women are into. I haven\u2019t done the research, but I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s a big thing now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m not sure, but I think it\u2019s all about things.\n\n6. The Russian Pee Tape\n\nSell it online. I know I\u2019d probably throw up the sweet-and-sour chicken I ate yesterday if I laid eyes on Trump\u2019s bloated, pale, quince-shaped naked body dripping wet with Moscovian-prostitute urine, so I wouldn\u2019t watch it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI just want to see the memes on Black Twitter.\n\n7. A Police Officer Convicted of Killing an Unarmed Black Person\n\nOr a unicorn. Or a high-resolution photo of Bigfoot. Or Donald Trump telling the truth. Or Kellyanne Conway combing her hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI mean ... if you want to spread fake news, make it something good.\n\n8. Natural Hair Products\n\nBlack women would click on anything that moisturizes their 3c-grade hair and holds their curl pattern when it rains. I don\u2019t know what any of that means, but they do. Black hair products are proof that the U.S. excludes black women from STEM research because every woman is a Ph.D.-level chemist when it comes to her hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Conspiracy Theories\n\nThis is one of the few categories both black and white people can agree on. Anything on the internet is automatically verified as true and will be shared instantly.\n\nI\u2019m sure you saw the Facbook video with the chain-smoking woman talking about the \u201celectric magnet pulse\u201d this weekend.

Blige\u2019s glow up this awards season; in fact, we\u2019re not sure we\u2019ve stanned this hard for her since What\u2019s the 411? The singer and actress has been nominated for Golden Globe, Critics Choice and Screen Actors Guild awards, and now a history-making two Oscar nods for both her performance and original song in Dee Rees\u2019 Mudbound. And she has stunned us on every single red carpet.\n\nBut those stunning looks have a secret weapon in a longtime member of Blige\u2019s team: celebrity makeup artist D\u2019Andre Michael. Knowing how much we wanted the 411 on Blige\u2019s super-fly SAG Awards look, Michael let The Glow Up in on a surprisingly low-priced secret: He exclusively used products from Black Opal.\n\nYes, THAT Black Opal (its Instagram is kind of poppin\u2019, by the way). In Michael\u2019s words:\n\nI\u2019ve been working with Mary J. Blige for years, and I love trying new looks on her. I wanted to create a showstopping look using Black Opal for her first-time appearance at the SAG Awards. Once I saw her gown, I knew I wanted to transform her into an elegant smoked goddess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was smokin\u2019 indeed, styled by fashion fave Law Roach in a one-shouldered black-and-white gown with a dramatic wing motif by designer Jean-Louis Sabaji.\n\nMichael, who\u2019s been on Blige\u2019s team for over a decade, complemented her dress and sleek modern hairstyle with a perfect smoky eye atop glowing skin, using Black Opal all the way. He shared with The Glow Up why, after years of working with the superstar, this awards season is such a special one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up: As a longtime member of Mary J. Blige\u2019s team, what\u2019s it like to work with her during this groundbreaking phase of her career?\n\nD\u2019Andre Michael: Having been with Mary J. Blige now for 11 years, we are more like family. I am so proud and honored to be a part of this moment with her. I\u2019m happy and overjoyed with her continued success, but this is like the stepping-stone to something I know she has been passionate [about]. It\u2019s amazing to see the acknowledgment and praise she is receiving for her work as an actress. I\u2019m like a proud brother.\n\nTGU: Mary\u2019s looks have been phenomenal at every event. How are you able to keep her looks so fresh?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDM: I have been with her every step of the way: Every award show, every red carpet, press junket, television show, etc. It\u2019s always been my thing to make her look good every time.\n\nMaybe because she\u2019s on a different platform now, a broader audience is taking note, but nothing has changed much with what we do. It\u2019s being there as a support for her in all that she\u2019s going through personally, making sure her spirits are up and she feels good about herself and comfortable with how she looks, what she\u2019s wearing, etc. So I think what shines through mostly is her \u201chappy\u201d\u2014and when you feel good internally, it shows externally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: You used exclusively Black Opal for Mary\u2019s SAG Awards look. Tell us why we should be checking for drugstore brands, and why Black Opal works so well for our tones?\n\nDM: I have never been one to follow trends or fads, mainly because trends come and go, and fads fade away. However, staying true to myself as an artist and finding things that work for me to use on my clients is most important. That\u2019s above any brand\u2014whether it is department store, drugstore or specialty store.\n\nI have learned just because something has a name brand on it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s suitable for what I need to use it for. Therefore, it is all about the quality of a product, and sometimes the most expensive product isn\u2019t necessarily the best. A lot of my favorite go-to products are drugstore brands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy friend Sam Fine worked with Black Opal years ago and helped them with their colors and palettes. Even then, I realized It was a brand that I could trust, because he\u2019s an amazing artist that I respect and call a friend. So if Sam trusts them, I know I can.\n\nDM: Black Opal has always been a staple for having a great color range for women of color; from the fairest of women to the darkest, you could trust you are in good hands with the Black Opal brand, and the formula is great. It gives great coverage that you could work with, whether you need a light coverage to a complete coverage. The Black Opal True Color Skin Perfecting Stick Foundation is amazing! It is great to see they are still around and providing women of color and us professionals with great colors and a great formula.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: At 47, Mary looks incredible. Can you talk about how makeup differs for women in her age group?\n\nDM: The only difference is probably the fads and trends you may want to stay away from with a more mature woman. In terms of looks, you definitely want to use less powder and more products that enhance a dewier look.\n\nFor eyes, most to all women can carry a smoky eye. Many think \u201csmoky eye,\u201d and they think black or dark. But you can smoke your eyes with almost any color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn terms of skin, I like to do my concealer, then apply my foundation, next set with a powder, and maybe spritz your face with a mister or the Evian mist spray to infuse the powder and foundation. Next, let it air-dry to take away the powdered look so you have more of a dewy skin appearance.\n\nIlluminators work as well, but know that sometimes these can come across drab and chalky looking if you use the wrong color. For women of color, I recommend an illuminator in the flesh-tone range (bronzy or mauve, etc.), and stay away from pearl color or yellows or orange-based colors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, even after all that great advice, we couldn\u2019t let Michael go without getting his step-by-step for creating Blige\u2019s SAG look, and all the products he used. How else are we going to plan for our next shopping trip?\n\nFor the Face\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the Eyes\n\nTo sculpt and define Blige\u2019s eyes, Michael used the Black Opal Aurora Eyeshadow Palette. First, he used the Brazen Copper shade on her entire eyelid. Next, he added Brazen Bronze on her crease, adding the Bordeaux Beige shade along the brow bone as a highlight.\n\n\n\nMichael then finished the eye look with Black Opal Color Splurge Automatic Eye Lining Pencil in Licorice, adding it along the lash line and inner lid and smudging to create a smoky look. Note: This eye pencil is formulated with aloe vera and chamomile extracts that help to soothe the delicate eye area as you define it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Lasting Lip\n\nFor the finishing touches to Blige\u2019s look, Michael used Black Opal Lip Color Splurge Stick Lip in Purr, a soft, pale-pink color enriched with emollient butters and vitamins C&E. This lipstick provides a bright, pigment-rich color that provides a smooth, creamy, nondrying finish.\n\nNo word yet on what Blige\u2019s look will be for the 90th Academy Awards on March 4. But even after Michael works his magic, we know the finishing touch will really be Mary J. Blige\u2019s happiness. The Glow Up gang will be watching on our live Facebook group thread and rooting for her\u2014and everybody black!", "keywords": ["mary", "sag", "black", "limit", "bliges", "look", "looks", "love", "price", "js", "color", "opal", "michael", "great", "awards", "eye"], "polarity": 0.24930036777381906, "subjectivity": 0.5446655237584439},

Because both suspects are rich white men (even though their riches are now up for question), both sides agreed that a home detention would be adequate, according to Fox News.\n\nUpdated Monday, Oct. 30, 2017, 11:05 a.m. EDT: Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, and Rick Gates, Manafort\u2019s business associate, are facing multiple charges that include \u201cconspiracy against the United States,\u201d \u201cconspiracy to launder money,\u201d \u201cunregistered agent of a foreign principal,\u201d \u201cfailure to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts\u201d and \u201cfalse statements.\u201d\n\nAccording to NPR, both men are expected in court in Washington, D.C., by Monday afternoon in what marks the first major public action by special counsel Robert Mueller, who is really showing his hand and making it known that he is not here to play games.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the Monday-morning buzz, it was also revealed that former campaign foreign policy aide George Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI throughout the Mueller probe.\n\nCourt documents claim that Papadopoulos had extensive contact with people who were known to be connected to the Russian government, including one individual who apparently told him that Russia had \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth Manafort and Gates turned themselves over to the FBI on Monday; however, Papadopoulos\u2019 status remains unclear, according to NPR.\n\nIn the meantime, Trump is still doing what Trump does best\u2014tweeting instead of managing the country\u2014and he claimed Monday that whatever Manafort is up against concerns things that happened \u201cyears ago\u201d before he joined the Trump campaign. And then, of course, he had to throw in \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d for good measure ... because is it really a Trump tweet unless Hillary Clinton is mentioned?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to NPR, Manafort and Gates\u2019 indictment actually does not allude to Russia\u2019s alleged interference with the election, but it does zero in on the financial ties between Manafort and Gates and \u201cpowerful Ukrainians.\u201d\n\nFrom NPR:\n\nThe indictment released on Monday charges Manafort and Gates with the extensive use of offshore back accounts, through which flowed more than $75 million. The document alleges that Manafort laundered more than $18 million of that to conceal it from U.S. authorities and Gates transferred more than $3 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Post details how Manafort lived his best life with his funds, going on $12 million shopping sprees for items that included antiques, Range Rovers and more:\n\nEight pages of the indictment detail the other lavish expenditures Manafort made over the years. They include: -$5.4 million to a home-improvement company located in the Hamptons, where Manafort owns a mansion in Bridgehampton -$1.3 million to a home-automation, lighting and home entertainment company in Florida -More than $272,000 for payments on at least four Range Rovers and a Mercedes Benz -$934,350 to an antique-rug store in Alexandria, Va., plus an additional $100,000 purchase -Nearly $850,000 on men\u2019s clothes in New York and another $520,000 to a clothing store in Beverly Hills -Nearly $820,000 on a Hamptons landscaper -$623,000 to an antique dealer in New York -$20,000 for housekeeping in New York\n\nPapadopoulos\u2019 documents, for comparison, detail his widespread contact with Russian-linked operatives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUpdated Monday, Oct. 30, 2017, 9:14 a.m. EDT: Paul Manafort, President Twitter Fingers\u2019 former campaign chairman, surrendered to federal authorities Monday morning.\n\nBoth Manafort and his former business associate Rick Gates were advised Monday morning to turn themselves in, and Manafort appeared to do so just after 8 a.m.\n\nHere\u2019s your much-requested perp walk:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs NPR notes, Manafort was taken into custody just days after a federal grand jury assembled by Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller voted to indict a figure in the investigation related to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nNPR reports that it is possible the grand jury\u2019s indictment will be unsealed Monday.\n\nOf course, as Donald Trump\u2019s house of cards comes a-tumbling down, POTUS is resorting to his favorite tactic: distract, distract, distract.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrumPutin himself fired off several tweets from his personal Twitter account talking about the Affordable Care Act, the Dems and Hillary Clinton, and just about everything else over the past 24 hours except for the fact that his campaign chairman has apparently been caught with his ass out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier:\n\nPaul Manafort is about to have to answer to some serious questions (and a trial, it looks like) after he was ordered to surrender to authorities, signaling special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s first strike in his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Manafort and his former business associate Rick Gates were advised to turn themselves in Monday morning, representing the first charges in the special counsel investigation led by Mueller.\n\nMueller is investigating whether or not associates of President Donald TrumPutin and Russian officials coordinated to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Times notes that the charges lobbed against Manafort and Gates are not immediately clear.\n\nGates is tangled up in this mess because, as the Times notes:\n\nMr. Gates is a longtime prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and junior partner of Mr. Manafort.

The Sun reports that Greenwood apologized to his \u201cfellow students, the entire Cornell community and my family and friends.\u201d There was no mention as to whether he apologized to the black Cornell student who was subjected to his racist language.\n\nGreenwood, as is par for the course in these sorts of apologies, made sure to mention that the language he chose to use \u201cneither reflects my values nor who I am.\u201d\n\nEarlier:\n\nAnyone who thinks \u201cclean-cut American kids\u201d are somehow incapable of violent acts of racism hasn\u2019t been paying attention.

The news was reported by the Cornell Daily Sun.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe student assaulted, who is currently a junior, spoke to the Sun and the New York Times last week about the incident, which happened outside his Collegetown home. He told the outlet that he came home at 1 a.m. to find a group of students arguing with his housemates. The victim says that after asking the students to leave, the young men insulted him and called him the n-word before four or five of them began punching him in the face.\n\nHe spoke to the outlets on condition of anonymity and has not been identified by police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe alleged assault, coupled with an earlier incident in which a Cornell student chanted \u201cbuilding a wall\u201d near the campus\u2019s Latino Living Center, has prompted the Ivy League university to pull together a campus task force to address racism and bigotry there.\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press reports that the university is also investigating the beating as a possible hate crime.\n\nA lawyer who said he represents Greenwood told the Daily Sun that his client was not involved in the assault on a black student.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTo be clear, the use of the n-word, and any related racist or derogatory language, is completely unacceptable not only at Cornell but anywhere in America,\u201d Raymond Schlather said. \u201cMy client understands this well; such language not only offends his values but does not reflect the person he is.\u201d\n\nAccording to the campus newspaper, Greenwood is a former squash player at the school. Hailing from Toronto, the Cornell sophomore also appears to have attended Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts\u2014an elite prep school that charges over $60,000 in tuition to board there.\n\nThe other assailants are believed to be members of the fraternity Psi Upsilon. While a Cornell administrator said in a statement last week that members of a \u201ccurrently unaffiliated fraternity\u201d were involved in the attack, the campus\u2019s Black Students United organization named Psi Upsilon outright. Last week, the phrase \u201cYou Rasist fucks [sic]\u201d was spray-painted on the chapter\u2019s former frat house. According to the Sun, the fraternity announced Wednesday that it would immediately close its chapter at Cornell and open up the house for use by other student orgs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt first blush, it would seem that all of the alleged assailants are exactly who you would cast to play \u201cgood,\u201d preppy American boys: Ivy Leaguers, frat members, well-heeled attendees of the best prep schools in the country. It\u2019s not particularly surprising that racist incidents happen in liberal enclaves, or that the wealthiest and most privileged among us are capable of cowardly, racist attacks.\n\nBut it\u2019s further proof that the belief, all too common among many Americans, that education or wealth can insulate someone from racist behavior has run well past its expiration date.", "keywords": ["student", "assault", "black", "prep", "cornell", "school", "university", "greenwood", "ithaca", "students", "motivated", "week", "identify", "racially", "language", "thug", "racist", "ny"], "polarity": 0.013236914600550964, "subjectivity": 0.37185032139577595},

Everyone\u2019s fixated on the screen and the movie\u2019s jokes may get a laugh or two, but because most everyone there is there working, it\u2019s just not the same as sitting back and just having fun.\n\n\n\nLike a lot of people across the world, I saw Marvel\u2019s Black Panther multiple times this weekend because I wanted to pore deeply over the film\u2019s narrative layers and drink in the visual richness that is Wakanda. But while hopping around from theater to theater, something else\u2014something beautiful about the movie became clear for me: the only way to really appreciate how powerful Black Panther is is to see it in a black movie theater with a predominantly black audience.\n\nBecause of how close it is to my apartment, the AMC Magic Johnson in Harlem is where I\u2019ve ended up seeing nearly every Marvel movie in for the past few years, but the atmosphere in the theater this past Friday was unlike anything I\u2019d ever experienced there before. Long before even stepping foot inside the building, you could tell who had made their way to Harlem specifically to see Black Panther and how, for many people, the night was part of a bigger cultural event. In the light of the lobby you could see groups of women rocking gorgeously-styled geles and excitedly stanning in front of larger than life cutouts of actor Danai Gurira\u2019s Okoye in her Wakandan finest.\n\nKids in panther masks weaved their way in and out of the ridiculously long of people waiting to scan their tickets and even though the place was hectic, you could feel just how pumped everyone was\u2014not just for the movie itself, but to be celebrating something like Black Panther in a distinctly black space.\n\nNo two audiences react to a film the exact same way, but what was enlivening about sitting in a theater full of black families and friends was the way everyone was able to fall into different rhythms with the movie while watching it together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoments like T\u2019Challa\u2019s fight against M\u2019Baku atop Warrior Falls drew everyone together in support of the Royal Family, but you could sense a distinct divide grow in the audience as Erik Killonger argued his case for an expansionist Wakanda. Every time the camera trained its focus on Michael B. Jordan (especially while he was shirtless) someone made a point of reminding everyone just what a vision he is to look at. But just moments later someone on the opposite side of the theater never missed a chance to (lovingly) tut and suck their in disapproval teeth of Killmonger\u2019s extremism. Just as Black Panther was engaged in a very specific kind of dialogue with the audience, we were engaging with one another in real time\u2014a call and response of sorts about the story developing before our eyes.\n\nThere were more than a few scenes\u2014usually after one of Shuri\u2019s flawless zingers\u2014where the entire theater erupted into laughter that drowned out a few seconds of dialogue that no one could hear. In those moments it didn\u2019t feel as if anyone was missing out on the movie, but rather that as a collective, we all slipped into a comfortable familiarity with and understanding of one another that was more important than the specifics of the plot.\n\nBlack Panther\u2019s online hype is a force to be reckoned with, but it doesn\u2019t quite capture how profoundly moving it is to see rows full of little black girls and boys staring up in wonder at the Dora Milaje while they\u2019re kicking ass and taking names. They saw themselves on screen in Black Panther\u2019s heroes and its villains and I saw myself in them\u2014young and vibrant and inspired by the very idea of futuristic, distinctly African blackness destined to save the world from itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of this was exactly the case at the screening on the Upper East Side I attended later in the weekend. The lines were just as long and the excitement was still palpable, but the sense of togetherness and kinship was missing. There were no families posing in front of the Black Panther cardboard standups with their arms proudly crossed in Xes over their chests or carefully placed kente cloth accents as a part of people\u2019s ensembles. I enjoyed the movie all the same, but I couldn\u2019t help but feel as if something important was missing from the experience and I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s something that the theater could have replicated even if it wanted to.\n\nWakanda itself may not be a real place, but the magic and wonder that Black Panther presents itself is. It\u2019s the magic and wonder that all black people know we\u2019re more than capable of creating in the world when we come together and rally behind a cause and it\u2019s something that can never be celebrated enough That power and sense of connected is the narrative foundation upon which Black Panther is built and it\u2019s something that\u2019s best experienced in the company of other black people.", "keywords": ["wonder", "theater", "panther", "black", "missing", "movie", "really", "saw", "way", "sense", "understand", "world"], "polarity": 0.13295068027210888, "subjectivity": 0.4657738095238094},

On Thursday, Sessions announced that he would recuse himself from any investigations related to the 2016 election, including any on Russian interference.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that Sessions held a press conference Thursday to announce his recusal, and the Post was kind enough to provide us with an annotated transcript that highlights what Sessions said to the press and also provides applicable references to questions asked during the confirmation hearing, as well as references to where Sessions may have later contradicted himself or backpedaled on his statements.\n\nWhat is on display in this transcript is an amazing feat of legal contortion.\n\nWhile it is a good thing that Sessions recused himself, let\u2019s not break our hands applauding him. He needs to resign. He is yet another member of this administration who has proved himself to be dishonest, and because of his position as U.S. attorney general, his actions and lies are especially egregious.\n\nAlso worth noting is the fact that everyone is foaming at the mouth about allegations that he had conversations and dealings with Russia, but was otherwise silent about him being a racist pushing an agenda that will have a direct negative impact on people of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those who may not have time to click through, some of the highlights are included below.

Sessions said in sworn testimony during his confirmation hearing to become attorney general that he \u201cdid not have communications with the Russians.\u201d The question involved the campaign, but he wasn\u2019t asked directly whether he spoke with Russia ABOUT the campaign. Sessions also said The Washington Post\u2019s report Wednesday night was \u201cfalse\u201d even though the report didn\u2019t alleged he had spoken about the campaign with Russia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeff Sessions:\n\n[T]he idea that I was part of a quote, \u201ccontinuing exchange of information\u201d during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government is totally false.\n\nPost notes:\n\nThis quote is from Sen. Al Franken\u2019s (D-Minn.) question to Sessions, which elicited Sessions\u2019s denial. But Franken didn\u2019t ask Sessions whether he was part of the \u201ccontinuing exchange of information\u201d during the campaign. He said that phrase while summarizing a news report and then asked Sessions, \u201cif there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will you do?\u201d Sessions\u2019s argument is basically that he understood\u2014and perhaps misunderstood\u2014this question to be only talking about the campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions:\n\n\n\n[M]y reply to the question of Senator Franken was honest and correct as I understood it at the time.\n\nPost notes:\n\n\u201cAs I understood it at the time\u201d is an interesting phrase. It seems to allow Sessions, if he needs to, to say that he misunderstood the question. That could help him if he ever were to face a perjury charge\u2014which, we should note, there is no evidence of.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions:\n\nIn fact, on Monday of this week, we set a meeting with an eye to a final decision on this question. And on Monday, we set that meeting today. So this was a day that we planned to have a final discussion about handling this. I asked for their candid and honest opinion about what I should do about investigations, certain investigations. And my staff recommended recusal. They said that since I had involvement with the campaign, I should not be involved in any campaign investigation. I have studied the rules and considered their comments and evaluation. I believe those recommendations are right and just.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPost notes:\n\n\n\nSessions says he will recuse himself from matters involving the Trump campaign\u2014but also makes clear that it was a decision that predated the current controversy. This allows him to claim he\u2019s not admitting fault.\n\nIt goes on and on.

The GOP has accused him of a conflict of interest in that case because his wife accepted nearly $500,000 in political donations from Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe in a state legislature bid that predated the investigation. The Washington Post reported, in December, McCabe\u2019s intention to retire when he became eligible for pension benefits in early March. Trump, who has been among McCabe\u2019s fiercest critics, characterized the move as \u201cracing the clock to retire with full benefits.\u201d A spokesperson for the FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump, as early as July, had called for McCabe\u2019s ouster, demanding, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t A.G. Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation?\u201d \u201cHow can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin\u2019 James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife\u2019s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?\u201d he tweeted in December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Washington Post reports that after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, he asked McCabe during a closed-door meeting whom he voted for during the 2016 election.\n\nThe Hill notes that because McCabe is a civil servant, it was almost impossible to fire him unless there was clear evidence that he\u2019d done something wrong.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why McCabe decided to retire just months from his retirement, or whether scrutiny over his tenure had intensified. According to CNN, there have been conflicting reports as to what actually took place:\n\nVarious sources described McCabe\u2019s departure as a mutual decision, while others said it was the result of pressure to step down. One source briefed on the matter said McCabe announced his decision to senior executives and portrayed it as his choice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne source told the news network that McCabe\u2019s sudden announcement was not in the plans as of Friday. \u201cHe had enough of being undermined and criticized,\u201d another source said. But Trump and the administration were \u201cnot happy\u201d with him, the same source said, CNN reports.\n\nTrump did not respond when questioned about McCabe\u2019s \u201cstepping aside\u201d\u2014which appears to be the company line.\n\n\n\nClearly, this was never going to work.

Now I happen to like it. It was well-acted, moving and is probably the second best Marvel movie after Captain America: Winter Soldier, but that\u2019s just me. All black people don\u2019t have to like the Black Panther movie, people like different kinds of movies just like they like different kinds of ice cream. However, what you can\u2019t do is be lactose intolerant, walk into Cold Stone Creamery complain that they didn\u2019t have a non-dairy version of butter cream confetti birthday cake, then write a thousand word think piece on how the ice cream industrial complex is misleading black folks. Yet, like clockwork late night college dorm cypher masquerading as revolutionary Twitter and blackademia are out in force saying Eric Killmonger was right, that the Black Panther movie is anti-revolution and that the white dude got too much screen time. There are plenty of legitimate critiques of Black Panther, but these aren\u2019t it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s get the big one out of the way first. Killmonger wasn\u2019t right. I know that people are having #expressyourunpopularopinion orgasms on Twitter, and I get it, folks are out there hustling for contrarian hot-takes on one of the most successful super hero films of all time to get clicks on their Soundcloud while blocking any disagreement. That\u2019s just social media. Doesn\u2019t mean any of the critiques are right, and most aren\u2019t. Eric Killmonger (who is the best Marvel villain of all time, since Loki really doesn\u2019t count as a villain) defeats T\u2019Challa in ritual combat, takes over as King of Wakanda and Black Panther, and vows to use Wakanda\u2019s advanced weapons to arm oppressed black peoples all over the world. Some people found Killmonger\u2019s aims to be noble and that the Black Panther movie was overt propaganda against revolutionary politics. Or some academics felt the movie demonized black American men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat black revolutionary thought are these folks reading? Killmonger\u2019s desire to free black people from oppression was noble, but his methods were ridiculous and his motives were questionable. Wakandans didn\u2019t resist Killmonger because of his ideas, they didn\u2019t agree with his methods, which were, again, ridiculous. black revolution in America hasn\u2019t failed because we don\u2019t have enough guns, it fails because white folks outnumber us 10 to 1, and that\u2019s in some major metropolitan areas. Weapons for self-defense or chasing the cops and the Klan out of your neighborhood are one thing, but going to war against the United States would mean the extermination of black people no matter how many Vibranium shielded rhinos you shipped to Ferguson. Now if Killmonger had wanted to turn Wakanda into a refuge for oppressed blacks across the globe, or bankrupt the imperialist powers in Europe and America by creating a single African currency based on Vibranium I\u2019m pretty sure T\u2019Challa would have at least been willing to check out a Powerpoint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThing is though, he didn\u2019t have a good plan, no matter how his supporters try to spin it. More importantly Killmonger\u2019s plan wasn\u2019t intentionally bad because Ryan Coogler wanted to discredit revolution, it was bad because there are still a lot of people dumb enough to think that black freedom in America can be achieved through direct combat. Peaceful Black Lives Matter activists get shot on the daily, what do you think would happen to a militarized black uprising?\n\nSpeaking of militancy, the notion that Black Panther is propaganda for incrementalist reform instead of wide scale revolution can only occur to you if you didn\u2019t watch the movie. Wakandans are a never-colonized, ethnocentric isolationist theocratic monarchy. In other words, the country is run by a royal family that worships a magical cat, and they don\u2019t care about anybody or anything beyond their borders, regardless of race. Heck, M\u2019Baku points out that no Black Panther had visited Jabari-Land for a thousand years and that was like a 15 minute hover bike trip from Panther Palace. How would it make sense in this movie for this nation to move from isolationists to pan-African revolutionaries in a few hours just because a guy dressed like Lil Fizz from B2K showed up with some fighting skills and a tattoo on his lip? Killmonger wants revolution, but only if he is in charge, W\u2019Kabi wants imperialism and Nakia wants humanitarianism, and T\u2019Challa is figuring out how to move Wakanda forward and how to get his girl back. Which brings us to the white man in the middle, Agent Ross. Some critics feel the need to center him in the movie, it\u2019s snarky and sloppy pop culture commentary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only reason Agent Ross was in Wakanda is because he took a bullet for the girl that the king was sweating. Notice the Wakandas weren\u2019t sharing Kimoyo beads with all those dead South Koreans lying around after Killmonger freed Klaue. After that they called him colonizer, locked him in a room and when he volunteered to help overthrow Killmonger; Shuri, T\u2019Challa and Nakia gave him the collective, \u201cOh, you\u2019re still here?\u201d look. The Wakandans never trusted, embraced or fully accepted Agent Ross; he was caught up in a palace coup and proved to be useful. If you think Black Panther spent too much time or gave too much focus on Ross you probably think Get Out was really about Detective LaToya and the inner workings of the TSA.\n\nHollywood doesn\u2019t make revolutionary movies, and even movies that \u2018look\u2019 revolutionary are really status quo propaganda. In every Planet of the Apes movie, even after years of being experimented on and oppressed, the monkeys that want justice and revenge on humanity are always the bad guys. In the X-Men movies even though Magneto is right every ... single ... time, he\u2019s the bad guy. In Django Unchained despite being a former slave himself Django cares nothing about freeing others, all he wants is to get his wife back. In other words, Hollywood movies only say violent revolution is okay if the oppressors are robots or aliens that we can\u2019t have sex with (notice why they had so much trouble in Battlestar Galactica?)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, none of these critiques apply to Black Panther, the movie isn\u2019t anti-revolution, it\u2019s a about the best way for black people to carry out our obligations to each other, wrapped up in a coup, and a bunch of CGI and fancy costumes. Killmonger\u2019s goal was noble, but his methods were nonsense and a-historical. Let\u2019s save the concern trolling think pieces until the next Tyler Perry movie, they\u2019re much more worthy candidates for this kind of scorn.", "keywords": ["black", "panther", "wrong", "yall", "movie", "revolutionary", "didnt", "killmonger", "revolution", "know", "movies", "wants", "think"], "polarity": 0.027858126721763094, "subjectivity": 0.4477436704709431},

There were thriving and ideological-diverse cities surrounded by expansive and bucolic countrysides. There was modern technology perfectly weaved in to cultural tradition, a melding that was symbiotic instead of antagonistic. And while I didn\u2019t see this happening during the movie, I\u2019m sure Wakanda has amazing bottomless brunches.\n\nUnfortunately, a present-day attempt to recreate Wakanda would be unrealistic. Mainly because we\u2019re roughly 20,000 years behind Wakandan tech. And mostly because we\u2019re too infected with colonization and its myriad residues and peripheral effects. Also, we\u2019re a little short on Vibranium.\n\nOne thing, however, that we can and definitely should start doing is what M\u2019Baku and his Que Dog Jabari Tribe did when encountering a problematic white dude who was speaking when there was no ask or need or purpose for the thoughts and opinions of problematic white dudes.\n\nBark.\n\nNot a purposeless bark. This isn\u2019t a shih tzu barking through the window at a squirrel. Instead this would be an intentional bark. A targeted bark. An overpowering bark. A drowning bark. A Wakandan bark. A bark meant to communicate \u201cUm, who told you that you can speak? When it is time for your words, we will let you know. And maybe that time will never come. We\u2019ll see. Now, just shut up and stand there. Maybe get on your phone and google \u2018How not to be a colonizer.\u2019 Whatever you do, I want to hear you not speaking.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bark doesn\u2019t just have to be a counter for useless words, either. A wayward white hand reaches for your hair? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! A group of white people huddled on a sidewalk refuse to step aside when you attempt to walk past them? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! A purse is clutched when you walk on an elevator? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! (If they\u2019re going to act scared, you might as well give them a reason to be.)\n\nOf course, this barking will take some practice. They can\u2019t be small dog barks, so people with higher and/or softer voices will probably have to do some training. Which is why, today, I\u2019m announcing the opening the M\u2019Baku School of Wakandan White Silencing. The classes will be free, so no worries about me using GoFundMe monies for bigen and Creatine.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Also, the bark was actually an ape grunt.

The hardest part was creating an entire country, more technologically advanced than anywhere on the planet, based around an indestructible super-metal that doesn\u2019t exist in the real world. The process started with a single question.\n\n\u201cOne of the questions [Coogler] was trying to ask and answer is what it means to be African in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,\u201d co-writer Joe Robert Cole told io9. \u201cWhich I think, in the back of your mind with this property, is always there.\u201d\n\nCole was one of the first people hired to make Black Panther, before even Coogler himself. He pitched a story to Marvel and had a treatment, but was sort of in a holding pattern until a director came on board.\n\n\u201cI knew I was not going to write the movie before there was a director on it,\u201d Cole said. \u201cI believe when they got into negotiating, [Coogler] saw [my treatment]. But then he had his own themes and ideas and vision for the movie. It was my job, at that point, to help him bring the movie he wanted to make [to life].\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce Coogler came on board and started writing with Cole, he brought in his own creative team as well. One of the key hires was production designer Hannah Beachler, who was tasked with figuring out what Wakanda looks like in the MCU. For her, the first question was simple but crucial: Where is Wakanda in Africa?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEven answering that question was a big question because [in Iron Man 2] there\u2019s a picture where of Wakanda on the map,\u201d Beachler told io9. \u201cAnd I said to Ryan, \u2018Is it there?\u2019 And we asked [Marvel Studios president] Kevin Feige, \u2018Is it there?\u2019 And he\u2019s like, \u2018I don\u2019t know, guys, where do you want it?\u2019\u201d\n\nThey decided on a a location on the Eastern part of the continent, below the Sahara desert. Once that was set, Beachler began researching cultures and tribes in that area, but that was just the first of many, many inspirations. She also looked at all eras of Black Panther comics, from Jack Kirby and Stan Lee in the \u201860s, to the Panther\u2019s Rage storyline of the \u201870s, all the way to the first storyline from the current run by Ta-Nehisi Coates and Brian Stelfreez. And while she blended elements from all of them, the original comics were particular helpful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI really wanted to spend time with the Jack Kirby designs because I wanted to understand that time period. What was going on in the world? What would he have known about Africa?\u201d Beachler said. She was fascinated thinking about how, at that time, those creators didn\u2019t have easy access to visual aids showing what Africa really looked like. What she found was they primarily used inspirations from the Timbuktu area of Mali, so those designs, coupled with superhero archetypes, were another source for her to draw from. \u201cIn that sense I am reaching back to the canon of it,\u201d Beachler said.\n\nCole, too, talked about going back to the canon of Black Panther when writing the script with Coogler. \u201cYou read all the comics. You look at the canon and you kind of extrapolate out,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat themes do you want to play with? What stories make sense? What\u2019s happening in the world? How do you bridge America with Africa? You just try to investigate ways to do that in character, in personal ways, so that they can resonate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComics and geography are only two of the elements that went into creating the country. Obviously, this Wakanda isn\u2019t in the \u201860s, it\u2019s now\u2014and since it\u2019s so technologically advanced beyond the rest of the modern world, Beachler\u2019s research also extended into future technology.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot about figuring out how many years in advance they were. A hundred years? Two hundred years? And in the end, we kind of settled on a number and then we started looking at tech that was coming,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cTED Talks and things like that. I talked to a lot of architects who were doing futuristic cities, who are designing Google cities, and anthropological architects, geologists. I did a lot of research on Elon Musk and his work with the Hyperloop. So all of that. Then you reach back into tradition, and I thought to myself \u2018How is it that this one specific thing evolved over time and became useful as a technology?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe \u201cone specific thing\u201d she\u2019s referring to is vibranium, a fictional substance which is Wakanda\u2019s most precious natural resource, and the key to the entire country. It drives everything there. Buildings, technology, clothes, culture\u2014it\u2019s all because of vibranium. The problem is, beyond being an unbreakable metal in Captain America\u2019s shield, there were no defined rules about it, even in the comics, where its properties had essentially mutated for decades. Both Cole and Beachler laughed when asked about defining what vibranium can and can\u2019t do and how that influenced the film itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was a process,\u201d Cole explained, \u201cbecause you\u2019re actually setting up the boundaries of what your story is and what this magical property is. And so we had a lot of discussions about, \u2018What can it do? What can\u2019t it do?\u2019 And some of it was discovering what we wanted the rules to be as we were discovering the story and what we needed it to be.\u201d\n\nFor Beachler it was even more tactile. \u201cThis is where the geologists came in,\u201d she said. \u201cI spent a lot of time figuring out the stages of vibranium because up until this point we\u2019ve really only seen it in Cap\u2019s shield. It has a very stainless steel look. So it looks like they have to mine it. That\u2019s where we started.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeachler also knew what the Black Panther suit was going to look like, which meant it was another dot to connect. \u201cSo I went through all of that research with vibranium,\u201d she said. \u201cLike, how does it go from this raw form to an ore to fabric to a stainless look, and then what does it look like when it\u2019s mined? That exists in the world. That was our foundation for everything.\u201d\n\nBut a foundation, by definition, is only a beginning. After the story was written and the world designed and built, there was still the casting, filming, editing, music, and so much more. The journey to get Black Panther on the big screen was a long one, but it started with the ambitious ideas of a few select people who were incredibly passionate about bringing this world to life.\n\n\u201cWe knew we wanted Wakanda to be a big character,\u201d Cole said. \u201cWe got to create this world and we wanted to root it as close to real-world Africa as possible.

Something about a nerdtastic property holding such cultural significance put me in a state of bliss. So, I made a return trip, you know, to make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything. (Yeah, sure. That\u2019s the only reason.)\n\n\n\nDuring the second viewing, something occurred to me regarding Erik \u201cI shouldn\u2019t like you as much as I do\u201d Stevens, aka Killmonger. I hesitate to call him a villain. A villain drudges up images of some huge, purple-skinned menace trying to fetch some mystical stones, a threat so powerful that the next Marvel installment, Avengers: Infinity War must be divided into two parts.\n\nKillmonger is more of an adversary, an antagonist you feel for because his motives are all too real. Black folks can relate to being done with the world\u2019s bullshit, and I can guarantee that some of us left the theatre wondering what we\u2019d do if we had access to all of Wakanda\u2019s resources. Klaue? He can go die in a fire for stealing our stuff and calling us \u201csavages,\u201d but you not-so-secretly hope that Killmonger and T\u2019Challa will come together, especially when you realize that Black Panther isn\u2019t just peak Afrofuturism: it\u2019s revisionist history.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel is no stranger to telling a story within the context of actual historical events; just think O Captain, My Captain (America), with his patriotic shield and penchant for punching Nazis. It adds a fantastic layer to these otherworldly stories; the knowledge of some grand superpower existing during our darkest hours. That\u2019s what Captain America stood for; even before the super soldier program, Steve Rogers was full of heart and optimism, a little guy who wanted to help the little guy.\n\nBut it\u2019s much easier for an all-American white soldier to take a chance than for an African king. This time around, I peeped them slave ships in that opening narration, so don\u2019t expect the Black Panther to jump at the chance to help the good ol\u2019 US of \u201cAye, we\u2019re gonna enslave your people and take them to this stolen land\u2014we mean, shared equally with the Natives\u2014Happy Thanksgiving.\u201d\n\nStill, that\u2019s Killmonger\u2019s entire beef with the Wakandans. They\u2019ve had every opportunity to help black folks, but chose to stay hidden. King T\u2019Chaka was so set on this that he killed his own brother\u2014and Killmonger\u2019s father\u2014N\u2019Jobu. That is classic revenge motivation, but it becomes more complex (and tragic) when you realize what was happening back in 1992, the year Killmonger was orphaned by his own people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from the fact that it\u2019s close to director Ryan Coogler\u2019s hometown of Richmond, CA, on the surface, Oakland, California in 1992 doesn\u2019t seem too significant. During my first viewing of the movie, I thought they were simply pulling a Civil War, which recalled the date when Tony Starks\u2019 parents were killed. But while the opening of Black Panther is a variation on this theme, when Zuri later tells the story to T\u2019Challa, we see N\u2019Jobu pleading with his brother to help their black American brethren fight violence and over-policing; everything we the people of 2018 know to have been a harsh reality for generations.\n\nSomething about \u201cover-policing\u201d and \u201c1992\u201d stuck with me after my second viewing of Black Panther, so I relied on my good friend Google to uncover what was in the back of my mind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1992 is when the Los Angeles riots took place. Rodney King, y\u2019all. Yes, in addition to everything else, Black Panther went there.\n\n\n\nOf course, the riots didn\u2019t take place in Oakland, but you best believe the character of N\u2019Jobu would\u2019ve heard about them. Leaving your black utopian society to learn about the police, the supposed protectors of the country you\u2019re surveilling, beating the shit out of a black man? And getting away with it? N\u2019Jobu was in America during one of the most well-publicized atrocities toward the black community.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImagine living in Wakanda, a world where black folks are treated with love and respect, then being sent out and bearing witness to Rodney-fucking-King. The riots could\u2019ve easily been the tipping point, the moment N\u2019Jobu decided that his people needed to do something. It was certainly better than the alternative: the riots happening after his death, leaving his son\u2014who would ultimately become Killmonger\u2014alone to deal with it. It certainly makes little Erik\u2019s line about everyone dying around them more heartbreaking, especially since he sheds no tears.\n\nAs a man, however, Erik Stevens/Killmonger does cry, because he realizes what he\u2019s become as he sits in the ancestral plane with his father. And even amongst all that violence and death, N\u2019Jobu still had dreams of showing his son life as it could be in Wakanda. He wanted to bring his son home\u2014or perhaps, he wanted to create that home in our country. Witnessing the power of Vibranium in this narrative, that single stolen vial could\u2019ve started a revolution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, here is your villain/anti-hero: Erik Killmonger, left fatherless in a world full of so-called protectors that abuse his brethren. He\u2019d grow up to see more men, women, and children go through the same ordeal or worse than Rodney King, only to become social media hashtags. He\u2019d grow up hearing us tell wistful stories of the \u201cMotherland,\u201d while simultaneously dealing with white folks telling us to \u201cgo back to Africa,\u201d as if we chose to be here in the first place.\n\nAnd yet Killmonger would also know that his family in that far-off prosperous land would kill one of their own to keep their land and resources safe; only to later sign the Sokovia Accords to police those with superpowers. So, he decided that he\u2019d create \u201cThe Motherland,\u201d for himself and for us. Villain or not, Killmonger was willing to start from the ground up to let them know who we are. It\u2019s so understandable that even T\u2019Challa snapped at his ancestors to tell them they\u2019d been wrong.\n\n\n\nThe idea of us being one tribe, as T\u2019Challa says in the mid-credits scene, works both ways. The betterment of our people will resonate with us all, but that also means that the brutality against our people connects us. No one knew that better than Killmonger. I imagine T\u2019Challa respected his cousin\u2019s wishes to bury him in the ocean, but I hope his influence will live with the Black Panther legacy for generations to come.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWakanda Forever.", "keywords": ["help", "riots", "black", "panther", "tchalla", "folks", "king", "history", "killmonger", "know", "cant", "njobu", "revisionist"], "polarity": 0.09868718238283454, "subjectivity": 0.4717369737750173},

To serve one\u2019s God is a mighty purpose. It requires selflessness and compassion.\n\n\n\nSo it is with all due respect that I ask, what the fuck happened to Mark Burns? I don\u2019t have any issue with him being a black Republican. I think many black Democrats, independents and definitely Hoteps fall into this trap of placing black Republicans at the heel of the white man, but I am not one of them. I believe that you can be a black Republican who just views things differently.\n\nBut beneath all of that is Pastor Mark Burns, a man so scorned that he is living in a bizarro Wakanda in which black people are living on sharecropped land that they believe they own but is really in the master\u2019s yard.\n\nOn the surface, Burns is an easily dismissible figure; he\u2019s a black pastor stumping for Donald Trump. If that isn\u2019t enough, he wears really short, fat Laurel-and-Hardy-esque ties (see below), and if you can make it past his tie, which looks like a cutoff sweatpants leg, then don\u2019t forget that he also lied about his entire r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and when he was called out on it during a live interview, he walked out. For all his heavy breathing and pastoral pauses, Burns could easily be labeled a huckster and placed into a box along with the rest of the sunken-place Trump supporters.\n\nBut we live in a social media world that trades likes and follows as digital currency, and in this sense, Burns is balling. To date, Burns has some 87,300 followers on Twitter and an additional 4,500 on Instagram. Not to mention, he pastors a church, which means he\u2019s preaching his love of Trump and all things Trumpian to rooms full of black people. And. They. Are. Listening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich brings me to two points: 1) We cannot dismiss Burns, and 2) What the fuck happened to him? Like, what level of self-hatred must you endure to fall this far? He\u2019s 38 years old, which means that someone in his life had to love him enough to induce him to the revolutionary sounds of N.W.A. Where was he during the No Limit movement? Has he ever been \u201cBout It, Bout It\u201d?\n\nDid he not watch the Diff\u2019rent Strokes episode where Dudley was almost molested by the bicycle-store owner, but for a quick-thinking Arnold? That kind of television changes a kid. I can\u2019t imagine the kind of woodsy upbringing that allows a black man in 2018, the year of our lord and savior Sterling K. Brown, to tweet this:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat happened. And this man is ministering to other black people. He\u2019s widening his platform daily and is one of the few public black faces that are helping to grease the asses of other black folks so that Trump\u2019s foot can fit. I don\u2019t understand how a Southern black man becomes this way, but it has me thinking that it was beaten out of him. And if so, that means that the whipping of blacks is still alive\u2014but I just can\u2019t imagine a world where you not only voluntarily allow yourself to be whipped but also actually sell it to your own people.\n\nIt\u2019d be one thing if Burns didn\u2019t have an audience, but someone is paying attention to his message, and it isn\u2019t just Southern whites and Russian bots.

It\u2019s not the answer we expected, but it accurately describes a high-tech spy adventure, set in an insular world where warring factions vie for leadership. But, last year on the Atlanta set of the highly anticipated superhero film, we learned there\u2019s much, much more going on.\n\nMore so than almost any Marvel movie before it, Black Panther has had an impossible task. Guardians of the Galaxy introduced a whole new section of the Marvel Cinematic Universe; Thor created an entirely new civilization, Black Panther has to do both of those things while making them them feel realistic enough to exist on Earth. The setting is Wakanda, a fictional African country whose abundance of the metal vibranium has made it incredibly rich and technologically advanced. It may look otherworldly, but it\u2019s part of our world, even though it remained hidden from the rest of it\u2014at least until T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman) revealed himself to the world as the Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War. But it\u2019s when the prince-turned-king returns home that Black Panther, directed by Creed\u2019s Ryan Coogler, begins.\n\nThe murder of King T\u2019Chaka and T\u2019Challa\u2019s sudden ascension to the throne have put Wakanda in turmoil, as summed up by what Moore called the questions at the heart of the film: \u201cWho rules Wakanda? How does Wakanda now deal with the loss of a king, who was a fair king, who people seemed to like? And is T\u2019Challa ready to be the king of Wakanda?\u201d\n\nBoseman explained that, at the start of the film, T\u2019Challa doesn\u2019t have time to think about being a superhero. \u201cHe\u2019s dealing with making the transition to filling the footsteps of his father,\u201d the actor said. \u201cSo it\u2019s probably going to feel like it\u2019s more about the political unrest than the superhero, initially.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat unrest will lead to a multi-faceted struggle between Wakanda and the CIA, in the form of Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman); fringe villains like Ulysses Klaw (Andy Serkis); power-hungry adversaries like Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan); and several other factions among the tribes that make up Wakanda. And that\u2019s not to mention T\u2019Challa\u2019s conflicting desires to help the world at large, but also keep his country both safe and secret.\n\nIn designing the look of not just the people of Wakanda, but the country itself, Coogler asked his longtime production designer Hannah Beachler for help. The two literally traveled the world from Africa to Korea and back, looking for inspirations, and came back with a movie that looks incredibly unique. \u201cHe always drags me into things I\u2019m not expecting I would ever do in my life,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cSo it\u2019s challenging and keeps me doing something new all the time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile on set last February, we were granted access to a conference room that had its walls lined with Beachler\u2019s work. It was overwhelming, especially several months before anyone outside of the production had seen the expansive, evocative aesthetic of the film. There were images of a huge spiral staircases made of metal and sand. Sweeping vistas of Wakandan landmarks\u2014like Mount Bashenga, the huge waterfalls of Warrior Falls, and the metal-meets-natural look of Golden City. \u201cOne of the things that we really wanted to be sure about Wakanda is the technology,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cI think that\u2019s something that all the fans want to see. \u2018What is this advanced civilization?\u2019 But the other thing that we really talked about was keeping the traditions of several different African tribes. So we really delved in to what that was, and how we mix this new and this old.\u201d\n\n(Here\u2019s a gallery of just some of that awesome art)\n\nShuri\u2019s Lab illustration by Drew Leung Steptown illustration by Till Nowak Palace Throne Room illustration by Till Nowak Palace Throne Room illustration by Till Nowak 1 / 4\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat new and old, a blending of African influences and advanced technology, is encapsulated in the designs of the Royal Talon and Talon Fighter. Each is an ultra-advanced ship, kind of like the Avengers\u2019 Quinjet, but only if you look at them from the sides. From the top, the ships are actually in the shape of an African mask. And though that sounds like a fairly radical idea, Beachler said her design was rooted in a future that\u2019s actually attainable. \u201cIt\u2019s not far off,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cIt\u2019s there in the conceptual ideas and designs that people are bringing, and we just are going to take it and show people, \u2018This is how it can be incorporated into a society.\u2019 So it\u2019s super-fun in that way.\u201d\n\nMore fun designs included images of a vibranium mine (which kind of looked like a scene from Tron, set underground, and which may be the setting for one of Black Panther\u2019s fight scenes), as well as T\u2019Challa riding a rhino, which is one of Wakanda\u2019s most precious animals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there was the Hall of Kings and City of the Dead, which evoke both the lush world of Pandora in Avatar and Westeros from Game of Thrones, where it appears the Wakandans pay tribute to past Black Panthers. \u201cIn the architecture and some of the dressing you\u2019ll get an idea of Panthers throughout the centuries,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see a little bit of it but I don\u2019t know that it\u2019ll be a big part of the film.\u201d\n\nDespite the executive producer\u2019s claim, the concept art we saw suggested otherwise; it looked like T\u2019Challa would perform some kind of astral projection that would allow the audience to see a bit of himself as a child, and Beachler hinted at this, too. \u201cYou see a lot of masks, all the panther masks, and you see how they do a lot of their rituals... and it will be fabulous and wonderful,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then also the dream states that he goes into when he meets the ancestors.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of Black Panther\u2019s other challenges is, if Wakanda is more advanced than anywhere else on Earth (and it is), it has to exceed any and everything we\u2019ve seen before in Earth-based Marvel movies. \u201c[Iron Man] was the one that set the pace for what you know as being futuristic [with Marvel],\u201d Beachler said. \u201cSo we did have to be mindful of how we\u2019re going to make it different. And we wanted Wakandans, and especially T\u2019Challa, to do the same things, but not have it be as recognizable as what Tony Stark is doing.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis technology is also where Black Panther finds its politics. \u201cJust the idea of Wakanda being a nation in Africa that is the most technologically advanced in the world is a political statement without us having to go too much far past that.\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think if people knew they had vibranium, which they do, they were going to be conquered or at least be at war forever. So they did the smart thing. They hid that fact so nobody knows they have this stuff. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve been able to have these advancements. They don\u2019t spend money on war. They don\u2019t spend money defending themselves constantly. They just spend money on infrastructure which is something, again, that will feel topical.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of the resources, advancement, and prosperity of Wakanda, a character like Shuri can exist. Played by Letitia Wright, Shuri is the smartest person in Wakanda and leader of their technological development. She\u2019s also T\u2019Challa\u2019s 16-year-old sister. \u201cIt\u2019s not very often that you see a superhero with a little sister,\u201d Boseman said. \u201cSo I think it brings out a different part of his character. Usually you have the damsel in distress [but] I don\u2019t think there are any damsels in distress in this movie.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an understatement. Coogler and his team have packed Black Panther with many, many strong black women. Paramount among them are the members of the Dora Milaje, the personal security for the King of Wakanda. However, while in the comics these warrior characters are at times sexualized, that\u2019s not the case in this film. Moore described them as more of a \u201cSEAL Team Six,\u201d each with their own unique characteristics and personalities. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t expect, and what [Coogler] really wanted to explore, is the depth of the emotional connections between T\u2019Challa and those individuals,\u201d he said. In other words, according to costume designer Ruth Carter, \u201cWe didn\u2019t want the guy in the skin suit walking around with the girls in the bathing suits.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the Dora Milaje, another classic Black Panther character in the film is Erik Killmonger, played by Coogler\u2019s longtime collaborator Michael B. Jordan. The actor said while the character is certainly a villain, he\u2019d more accurately described him as a \u201crevolutionary.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTrue villains, the really good ones and the interesting ones, the watchable ones, truly believe what they\u2019re doing is the right thing,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cAnd if you can somehow blur that line for the people\u2026 if you can kind of get them to see that other point of view, I think the battle\u2019s won.\u201d So it seems Killmonger\u2019s taste for power will have some form of selfless motivation to it, while Jordan will act them out in nearly unrecognizable fashion. His costume looks like a military Dragon Ball Z mash-up, complete with blue armor plates, beads holding it together, fatigue pants, gold teeth, and dreadlocks.\n\nKillmonger isn\u2019t the only other villain T\u2019Challa must deal with in Black Panther. There\u2019s also Ulysses Klaw, played by Andy Serkis, first seen in Avengers: Age of Ultron. His performance there sets the tone here. \u201cKlaw doesn\u2019t really trust or work with anybody; he is his own man,\u201d Serkis said. \u201cHe does deals with people, he interacts, but he doesn\u2019t form allegiances or alliances with anyone. Ultimately, he\u2019s a lone wolf. He has these pop-up groups wherever he happens to be in the world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose uncertain alliances seemed to be at the center of the scene Coogler and his team were filming when we were on set. The scene shot on February 3, 2017 featured Klaw, Killmonger, T\u2019Challa, Ross, Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), and Okoye (Danai Gurira), and took place at a CIA safehouse in South Korea where Klaw has been captured. T\u2019Challa and Okoye have just shown up and Ross is upset with them. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t see it before,\u201d he says. \u201cHow much more do you know?\u201d Just then, Nakia bursts in, speaking quickly in the African language Hausa. Suddenly a bomb goes off, the wall comes down, the window to the interrogation room cracks, and in storms KIllmonger and his crew, guns blazing. In the attack, T\u2019Challa somehow changes into his Black Panther suit and jumps on top of a grenade to save everyone, while bullets fly everywhere.\n\nThis scene was shot practically, including the two explosions. A major safety meeting was held on set beforehand and multiple rehearsals took place to make sure everyone was perfect on the timing. Boseman dynamically pushed himself up off the ground to really sell the grenade explosion. Multiple takes, increasing the coverage of the scene, were shot throughout the day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actors were unsurprisingly secretive about why Killmonger would be breaking Klaw out of this situation, as well as the rest of the film\u2019s plot. However, Moore said the film\u2019s main inspirations come from the current comic run of writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and the classic Black Panther stories of Christopher Priest, as well as some of the designs from those runs. There will be humor, but tonally Black Panther will be more Winter Soldier than Ant-Man. And though this is the last Marvel film which will be released before Avengers: Infinity War, it\u2019s not a set-up for that film.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to give Ryan the freedom to tell a story that wasn\u2019t relying on other things that were happening in the MCU,\u201d Moore said. \u201cNow that doesn\u2019t mean what happens in the film won\u2019t have ripples in the MCU, but the film itself isn\u2019t relying on other plot points in the MCU.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the end though, everyone involved really just wants fans to fall in love with the Black Panther and his country. \u201cImagine a whole world that is going to open up to audiences,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nBlack Panther opens February 16.\n\n*Correction: We had incorrectly labeled Hausa as an only south African language.

The ADL quoted a man named Jordan Jereb, who runs the small group, which is based in Tallahassee.\n\n\n\n\u201c \u2018Jereb added that ROF had not ordered or wanted Cruz to do anything like the school shooting,\u2019 the ADL wrote in a blog post that was quickly picked up by ABC News and The Associated Press, and later percolated through dozens of other media outlets. Even The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, picked up the claim\n\n\u201cSome outlets reported they had their own conversations with Jereb or classmates of Cruz who allegedly corroborated the association of Cruz with ROF.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut a few hours later, after law enforcement agencies said they had no evidence linking Cruz to ROF, Jereb said his identification of Cruz was a \u2018misunderstanding\u2019 and that he, too, had been the subject of a \u2018prank.\u2019 On online forums and Twitter, trolls and white nationalists gloated at the disinformation they had sowed.\n\n\u201c \u2018All of our evidence seems to point to the ADL getting this wrong,\u2019 said Joan Donovan, a researcher who tracks online misinformation campaigns for Data & Society, a think tank in New York City.\n\n\u201cThe ADL subsequently revised its report, as did many news outlets. . . .\u201d\n\nAssociated Press: White nationalist leader walks back comments that shooting suspect was group member\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJarvis DeBerry, NOLA.com | Times-Picayune: The numbing effect of multiple school shootings\n\nEditorial, Daily News, New York: Trump shoots blanks: He offers condolences but empty platitudes in the wake of South Florida\u2019s school massacre\n\nEditorial, Miami Herald: Yes, \u2018it\u2019 happened here.

Black Panther, who finds himself in a battle against an army led by the man who killed his father. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDaniels quoted Holland, \u201c \u2018One of the things that I have learned throughout this process is that the world has such rich stories that haven\u2019t been told yet,\u2019 he said. \u2018One of the things that writing these books does for me is it reminds me when I go to work every day that what we do as journalists is that we tell stories. We bring the hidden to light.\n\n\u201cJust like the \u2018Black Panther\u2019 movie and this novel does, they\u2019re bringing the character to light that some people knew about, and some people appreciated, but now through this novel and the movie, the entire world gets to know about it.\u2019\n\n\u201c \u2018. . . So, it just reminds me of how important our jobs are and how lucky we are as journalists to be able to do it.\u2019 \u201c\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTom DiChristopher reported Friday for cnbc.com, \u201cBoxoffice.com is currently forecasting the movie will haul in $190 million to $215 million over the long weekend. The website projects it will earn $178 million over three days.\n\n\u201cThat would be enough to put it in the upper range of the top 10 highest grossing openings for a superhero movie. At that level, Black Panther would top heavyweights such as Batman, Superman and Spider-Man and take aim at the best-ever debut for a superhero movie focused on a solo character.\n\n\u201cStrong reviews, outstanding pre-sales and a holiday weekend release underpin the bullish forecast, but it might be the revolutionary nature of the film that pushes it beyond consensus estimates, said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at boxoffice.com. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGene Demby, NPR \u201cCode Switch\u201d: Can Marvel\u2019s New Superhero Bear The Weight Of Representation?\n\nJohn Eligon; Kwame Opam; Carvell Wallace; Crystal Martin; Walter Thompson-Hernandez; Mekado Murphy; Manohla Dargis and A.O.

Woodson came up with the idea of Negro History Week in 1926. He chose the week that included the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln, Feb. 12, and Frederick Douglass, Feb. 14.\n\n\u201cInitially, only North Carolina, Delaware, West Virginia, Baltimore, Md., and Washington, D.C., signed on to the idea \u2014 and only for their black schools, which is exactly what Woodson wanted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSegregation, by law or tradition, was prevalent in the 1920s. Woodson never envisioned white students learning black history. His concern was that black students, deprived of a thorough education about their ancestors, would grow up accepting the yoke of inferiority that white people insisted they wear. . . .\u201d\n\nJackson also wrote, \u201cNegro History Week was ours alone, but Black History Month became something else. Inspired by the black power movement, black students at Kent State University organized the first Black History Month in 1970. The idea caught on and in 1976 President Gerald Ford included Black History Month as part of the nation\u2019s bicentennial celebration.\n\n\u201cWith segregation gone, more schools reserved time each February to study the contributions of prominent African Americans in history \u2014 from Denmark Vesey to Thurgood Marshall to Barack Obama. But unfortunately, learning names, dates, and events was typically as far as their studies went. Too often the necessary attention to context and relevancy was missing from the lessons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat lack of historical context was evident in the results of a study released in January by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which showed only 8 percent of high school seniors knew slavery was the main cause of the Civil War. Two-thirds didn\u2019t know it took a constitutional amendment to end slavery. That\u2019s a sorry testament to how history is being taught in America\u2019s schools.\n\n\u201cInstead of going beyond Woodson\u2019s original idea to focus on the positive contributions of individual African Americans, too many schools use Black History Month as a vehicle to teach a catalog of events and people without making tangible connections to the status of black Americans today.\n\n\u201cOne result is white Americans who don\u2019t believe slavery has anything to do with today\u2019s United States. Neither their regular history classes nor any additional study they may have done during Black History Month helped them connect the dots among slavery, segregation, and the poverty found in too many black communities today. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid W.

In those memos, Comey wrote about each time the president attempted to manipulate, dominate, bully and outright obstruct the federal investigation into Russian involvement in the election.\n\nMueller was appointed special counsel after a memo written by Comey revealed that the president had attempted to get him to put an end to the FBI\u2019s investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was appointed to both investigate the Russian collusion and look into whether or not the president had obstructed justice.\n\nObstruction of justice appears to be the larger part of Mueller\u2019s focus at this time, but he is still gathering information on possible Russian interference. Sessions, who was head of the Trump campaign\u2019s foreign policy team, can answer questions on the campaign\u2019s ties to the Russians as well as on whether or not Trump tried to obstruct the investigation.\n\nRemember, Trump was very upset when Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation last year and even said in an interview that he never would have given Sessions the job of attorney general if he had known that was going to happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClearly, Sessions has tea to spill.\n\nThis is all leading up to the eventual interview between Trump and Mueller, during which the president will likely be questioned about his decisions to send both Flynn and Comey packing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s team are already preparing themselves for the inevitable.

Ivanka is also playing a central role in the search, quietly field-testing ideas with people. \u201cIvanka is the most worried about it. She\u2019s trying to figure who replaces Kelly,\u201d a person who\u2019s spoken with her said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the magazine, the only reason Kelly hasn\u2019t been tossed out of the White House like Uncle Phil used to do Jazzy Jeff is that Trump knows that firing another senior staff member would do nothing but bring more trouble to his wobbly tenure.\n\nSources told Vanity Fair that Kelly doesn\u2019t want to be in the White House anymore and is only holding on to stay longer than Reince Priebus, the former White House chief of staff.\n\nThe seam started to split between Kelly and Trump after Kelly did an interview noting that the president\u2019s position had evolved since campaigning for office. The president was reportedly furious that Kelly would leak that truth on national television, since anyone with working ears and a decent set of eyes knows that his positions have moved more than an air hockey puck. Shortly after Kelly\u2019s interview, Trump took to Twitter, as he\u2019s been known to do, tweeting: \u201cThe Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut who didn\u2019t see all of this coming? In fact, many people were surprised that Kelly, a four-star Marine general, who was highly respected, would agree to work with a president who\u2019s been a hot button and arguably on the wrong side of history since running for office.\n\nKelly has been credited with streamlining who has access to the president and was instrumental in kicking hangers-on Omarosa Manigault Newman and Steve Bannon out of the White House. But Trump can\u2019t stand it when someone else is seen as the adult to his petulant-child antics, so of course this was never going to work out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe more Kelly plays up that he\u2019s being the adult in the room\u2014that it\u2019s basically combat duty and he\u2019s serving the country\u2014that kind of thing drives Trump nuts,\u201d a Republican close to the White House told Vanity Fair.\n\nIn recent days, Trump has fumed to friends that Kelly acts like he\u2019s running the government while Trump tweets and watches television.\n\nAlso, Trump reportedly told one friend: \u201cI\u2019ve got another nut job here who thinks he\u2019s running things,\u201d referring to Kelly, Vanity Fair reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, the White House will tell you that this is more fake news and that there\u2019s nothing wrong between Kelly and Trump. In fact, that\u2019s exactly what the White House did.\n\nA White House official told Vanity Fair: \u201cIt\u2019s categorically false that Trump is unhappy with Kelly. He\u2019s only ever referred to him as the general, tough, can be rough, and commands respect.\u201d\n\nAt this point, I don\u2019t believe anything that comes out of the White House. If they were a pair of pants, they\u2019d be on fire. If they were a journalist, they\u2019d be BuzzFeed Benny. If they were a black woman, they\u2019d be Rachel Dolezal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, basically, it\u2019s just a matter of time until Kelly announces that he\u2019s leaving the White House for a job in the mainstream, where he can better serve the Trump administration\u2014which is starting to be the company line.\n\nRead more at Vanity Fair.", "keywords": ["welcome", "worn", "fair", "trumps", "trump", "chief", "hes", "told", "kelly", "john", "house", "white", "staff", "theyd", "report", "vanity", "running"], "polarity": 0.10879365079365076, "subjectivity": 0.48612698412698396},

Obama\u2019s soaring speech, followed by Springsteen\u2019s song, offered a momentary respite from the grief, dread and shock many Americans experienced after the election of Donald Trump.\n\nAs the night came to a close and Michelle and Barack Obama walked off the stage hand in hand, one era was ending and another was coming into sharper view. Obama\u2019s and Springsteen\u2019s messages blended together to reassure listeners that everything would be all right: \u201cLeave behind your sorrows/Let this day be the last/Tomorrow there\u2019ll be sunshine/And all this darkness past.\u201d\n\nOne year after Trump\u2019s inauguration, a majority of Americans know that everything is not all right. The darkness that Springsteen sang about has not passed. Instead, it has surrounded and battered us on a daily, sometimes hourly, basis. Just when we think things can\u2019t get any worse, news breaks of another ill-informed, inappropriate and unpresidential tweet.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s lead role in escalating tensions between the United States and North Korea created mass hysteria in Hawaii when an emergency message was sent in error about a ballistic missile threat. Hawaiians and tourists ran to seek shelter and wrote frantic goodbyes via text message to their loved ones. Pick your nightmare. Anything is possible\u2014even nuclear holocaust\u2014with Trump as president.\n\nWe have serious cause to question whether our democratic principles will endure. Let\u2019s face the facts: The president of the United States is a racist, a xenophobe, a sexual predator, a chauvinist, and a thin-skinned and small-minded man who lacks empathy, morality and competence. He knows too little history to recognize that he is on the wrong side of it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is not only naive but it is dangerous to excuse Trump\u2019s words and actions with a wave of the hand and an assertion, as House Speaker Paul Ryan made after \u201ccandid conversations\u201d with Trump, that \u201chis heart is in the right place.\u201d\n\nIt is equally wrongheaded to claim that we could not have known that Trump would disparage women and people of color as viciously as he has. Recall Trump\u2019s comments before the election about grabbing women\u2019s genitalia or his view that Mexico was sending \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201crapists\u201d to America. Indeed, Trump catapulted himself into the political arena by ruthlessly questioning the citizenship status and the birth certificate of the country\u2019s first black president.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s racist deeds did not begin with his run for president or his decision to absolve neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va., for their hateful acts this summer. For the last 40 years, Trump has actively engaged in stoking this country\u2019s racist fires.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Justice Department sued Trump in 1973 for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in some of his housing developments to African Americans. In 1989 Trump spent $85,000 on full-page advertisements in New York City newspapers that called for the death penalty for the African-American and Latino teenagers who were wrongly accused of raping a white woman in the city\u2019s Central Park.\n\nAmericans knew who they were voting for, and still, they elected Trump.\n\nIf Trump has his way, America will no longer be a place where countless success stories of immigrants and the sons and daughters of immigrants are possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the past two years, Trump has dishonored the day that celebrates the life of Martin Luther King Jr. While former presidents\u2014Republicans and Democrats alike\u2014have honored the wishes of the King family and participated in a day of service, this year, Trump played golf.\n\nLast year, during the weekend of the King holiday, Trump mischaracterized the district of civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) as \u201cfalling apart (not to mention crime-infested)\u201d and \u201cin horrible shape.\u201d This was yet another example of Trump\u2019s ignorance: The district, which includes parts of Atlanta and its suburbs, is, in fact, a prosperous hub of tech companies and colleges.\n\nAs the 50th anniversary of King\u2019s assassination approaches this April, we must steel ourselves for more unpresidential behavior, as we have no reason to expect anything else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s comments about \u201cshithole countries\u201d should come as no surprise to those who are familiar with his long history of racism and who have followed his rise to power. But what makes these comments so disturbing is not whether they prove that Trump is a racist. We already knew that. His comments erode American values.\n\n\n\nA poll released Thursday showed a free fall in other nations\u2019 approval of American leadership, with such approval down 18 points to a historical low of 30 percent. The United States lags behind Germany and China and ranks just slightly ahead of Russia. Recall that on the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly boasted that he would restore the respect that Obama had supposedly lost while in office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBruce Springsteen\u2019s song underscores American ideals and uses the image of a train as a powerful metaphor for America as a nation of immigrants. Springsteen calls for a motley group of passengers to board a train and meet him in the \u201cland of hope and dreams.\u201d This train, we are told, carries \u201csaints and sinners,\u201d \u201closers and winners,\u201d \u201cwhores and gamblers,\u201d \u201clost souls,\u201d the \u201cbrokenhearted,\u201d \u201cthieves and sweet souls departed,\u201d and \u201cfools and kings.\u201d These passengers do not need tickets, Springsteen explains; all they have to do is \u201cjust get on board.\u201d\n\nOne could argue that throughout his presidency, Obama told people in the United States and around the world that in America, a singular opportunity existed to take a seat on the train that Springsteen describes. Obama reminded us that \u201cin no other country on earth is [his] story even possible.\u201d The son of a Kenyan immigrant, a black man named Barack Hussein Obama had ascended to the highest office in the United States.\n\nIf Trump has his way, America will no longer be a place where countless success stories of immigrants and the sons and daughters of immigrants are possible. America will be a fundamentally different country. We have already seen parents separated from their children and deported after living in the United States for 30 years. The lives of 800,000 \u201cDreamers\u201d continue to hang in the balance after Trump ended the Obama administration\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in September.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we give up on the hard work of maintaining a vibrant and diverse democracy and if we stop striving to become a \u201cmore perfect union,\u201d we will become more isolated and more diminished in the eyes of the world than we are now. We have always fallen short of our ideals, but the current occupant of the White House appears woefully ignorant of what those ideals are.\n\n\n\nTrump sorely needs a history lesson to learn about the untold contributions of immigrants who built this country and risked their lives to defend it. Trump has no curiosity or knowledge about the realities of the lives of Haitian immigrants, who he believes \u201call have AIDS.\u201d Nor does he understand Haiti\u2019s historic achievement of becoming the world\u2019s first black republic in 1804.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe fails to grasp the consequences of military interventions, imperialism and economic exploitation that Haiti has faced. He believes that Nigerians live in \u201chuts\u201d and remains unaware that according to the U.S. census, Nigerian immigrants eclipse both whites and Asians and have the highest levels of education in the country.\n\nIt will be a herculean, if not impossible, task to disabuse Trump of the numerous stereotypes, unsophisticated thoughts and outright incorrect ideas that he holds.\n\nOne wonders if Trump knows that Founding Father and fellow New Yorker Alexander Hamilton was an immigrant born to unmarried parents on the West Indian island of Nevis. Hamilton, who created a national bank and would become the first secretary of the treasury, moved with his mother to St. Croix, which was devastated by a hurricane in 1772. He eventually made it to New York after impressing local businessmen who raised money for his passage upon reading his eloquent report about the hurricane in a local newspaper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe preservation of American values and principles requires the courage and constant vigilance of political officials\u2014Republican and Democrat\u2014and everyday citizens. The \u201cland of hope and dreams\u201d that Bruce Springsteen sang of is not guaranteed to last forever.", "keywords": ["trumps", "trump", "united", "immigrants", "springsteens", "train", "springsteen", "losing", "obama", "soul", "states", "america"], "polarity": 0.011970418470418466, "subjectivity": 0.4373466810966811},

They were the best and strongest women from the 18 villages within Wakanda and trained at the royal palace.\n\nBut while Priest may in part cite supermodels as his inspiration, there is a historical prototype for the Dora Milaje in the Dahomey \u201cAmazons\u201d\u2014so nicknamed by European colonizers and now known by the French-speaking Beninese as the \u201cN\u2019Nonmiton\u201d (which translates to \u201cour mothers\u201d in Fon).\n\nCreated by King Agaja of the West African nation of Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) in the 18th century, the N\u2019Nonmiton were an all-female guard and fighting force, likely inspired by the female hunters known as gbeto. Like the Dora Milaje, the N\u2019Nonmiton were also considered wives of the king, pledging celibacy as well as loyalty and protection to him. And they existed in this role until the colonization of Dahomey in the late 19th century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can learn all about the incredible female warriors of Dahomey in a 2015 episode of the podcast Stuff You Missed in History Class, and in a very comprehensive comic on their history created by UNESCO for its Series on Women in African History (pdf).

While waiting to prepurchase tickets for Black Panther, I developed an unhealthy obsession with Fandango, and my wallet wept when the Funko POP! figures were released. I was excited to go to Wakanda, y\u2019all, and Wakanda did not disappoint.\n\nExcept for one aspect.\n\n\n\nMaybe.\n\n\n\nSee, something was revealed about the movie before its release: a missed opportunity for queer representation. Back in April, news spread of a rough cut in which Okoye (Danai Gurira) and Ayo (Florence Kasumba) did a bit of flirting. Vanity Fair\u2019s Joanna Robinson had this to say:\n\n\n\nIn the rough cut of this Black Panther scene, we see Gurira\u2019s Okoye and Kasumba\u2019s Ayo swaying rhythmically back in formation with the rest of their team. Okoye eyes Ayo flirtatiously for a long time as the camera pans in on them. Eventually, she says, appreciatively and appraisingly, \u2018You look good.\u2019 Ayo responds in kind. Okoye grins and replies, \u2018I know.\u2019\n\nShortly after the story broke, Marvel reached out to say that no, their relationship was not a romantic one (as stated in the update to Robinson\u2019s article). Oh, and it turns out, the scene was cut from the film, hence the \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d commentary on every single article that pops up if you Google the words \u201cBlack Panther queer\u201d right now. Co-screenwriter Joe Robert Cole said this in an interview with Screen Crush:\n\n\n\nI think the short answer is yes. I know that there were quite a few conversations around different things, different directions with different characters, and characters that we may have. We thought, \u2018Well, maybe we\u2019ll work it this way with an arc or work it that way with an arc.\u2019 The scene you\u2019re talking about, I don\u2019t remember. I can\u2019t remember the exact exchange you\u2019re talking about, but I think it was really brief. I\u2019m not sure. I know that it was not \u2013 there wasn\u2019t some major theme through that we were looking to explore with that in terms of the story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI sat there, waiting to feel betrayed, like Santa didn\u2019t deliver the puppy I wanted, no matter how good I\u2019d been. It\u2019s an all-too-familiar feeling as a black, queer woman: the Hollywood game of \u201cQueerness? What\u2019s that?\u201d Some exceptions may apply, like if it\u2019s a niche movie that won\u2019t have an entire toy section dedicated to it or that one side character whose name you don\u2019t remember. And, of course, there\u2019s Netflix or television (and I\u2019ve praised Black Lightning character Anissa Pierce to the heaven\u2019s above). But when it comes to those multimillion-dollar box-office hits? Yeah, no.\n\nSeeing Black Panther, I was fully prepared to be salty. But the salt never hit me. I went out, saw the movie, got home and ... no salt. Just pure black joy.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo then I thought, \u201cWow, Bri, what kind of queer woman are you?\u201d I should\u2019ve been cursing Ryan Coogler out, swift and fast like my mama taught me when someone pisses me off. But after thinking it over, I\u2019m happy the scene didn\u2019t make it into the movie, and that feels blasphemous to admit as someone who is always championing representation\u2014especially for queer folks of color like me.\n\nBefore I explain why, let me preface it by saying two things: 1) I don\u2019t expect every queer person of color to feel this way, and neither should anyone reading this. We\u2019re not some monolith that is always gonna see eye to eye, so don\u2019t be out here using my words to discredit someone\u2019s valid feelings. 2) People who have expressed disappointment with the scene\u2019s removal have still found joy in the movie. It doesn\u2019t make them hypocrites; it just means that they\u2019re capable of criticizing something they love. And that\u2019s how improvement happens.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m gonna level with you, as someone who\u2019s been squinting through heteronormative romance to try and find a whisper of queerness: Okoye and Ayo flirting with each other ain\u2019t enough for me anymore. It\u2019s the bare minimum of queer representation\u2014the table scraps\u2014especially if it\u2019s two women, and especially if those two women are attractive.\n\nLet\u2019s be real: T\u2019Challa and Nakia are getting whole-ass scenes that go beyond, \u201cI looked at you, then you looked at me.\u201d That\u2019s what I want more of in my queer representation, especially considering the source material that people were referencing when discussing Okoye and Ayo: World of Wakanda.\n\nWritten by Roxane Gay and Yona Harvey, this story is about Ayo and another Dora Milaje named Aneka (who doesn\u2019t appear in the movie, but people suspected Okoye had taken her place as a love interest). In the book, Ayo and Aneka are the focal points, and they\u2019re allowed to develop as both characters and lovers with each turn of the page.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can understand the excitement of potentially including this aspect in the movie, but that breeze of commentary between Okoye and Ayo? That ain\u2019t it. A moment like that can get easily swept away as, \u201cYou\u2019re reading too much into this,\u201d or even, \u201cThat\u2019s just how women are.\u201d\n\nAfter all, if Katy Perry taught us anything, it\u2019s that she kissed a girl\u2014and she liked it\u2014but don\u2019t read too much into it. To do this plot justice, there\u2019d need to be multiple interactions between those women, ones that didn\u2019t solely revolve around flirtation.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nI didn\u2019t think that was gonna happen with Black Panther. I would\u2019ve loved to see it, especially with all the time and care put into portraying Africa and black culture. But you know what else came with that clear love letter to Africa? Boycotts and plans to give negative reviews, because we\u2019re clearly trying to take over white superhero-dom.\n\nNow imagine, for a moment, the reaction if we also had queerness within this blackity-black movie. Actually, you don\u2019t have to imagine it; you can read the comments on any article that dares to complain about the scene\u2019s removal. Nothing says encouragement to implement some intersectionality like being told to let folks enjoy the damn movie without making things so \u201cpolitical\u201d\u2014even if there\u2019s already a comic featuring queer Dora Milaje.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo maybe Coogler and his crew are pacing themselves. Actress Florence Kasumba (who plays Ayo) recently spoke to Jamie Broadnax and Abraham Riesman in an Interview for Vulture about it. For the record, Kasumba is here for queer Ayo, but also had this to add:\n\n\n\nThe thing is, if the makers would have wanted everyone to see the scene, it would have been in the movie. The final result that we\u2019ve seen, there were a few scenes that have been cut. Different scenes, also. They didn\u2019t make it into the movie for certain reasons, and at that point, I have to say: What their reason is, I can\u2019t tell you, because nobody told me about whether it\u2019s in or not. But at this point, I personally think people have no idea who T\u2019Challa is, who are the Wakandans, what is Wakanda, where is Wakanda, what is their culture. There are so many important things that had to be told in these two hours. So the focus was on what is so important for T\u2019Challa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI realize that all of this is a frustrating pill to swallow. And real talk: If there\u2019s any group that\u2019s used to being told, \u201cYour representation might be there later,\u201d it\u2019s queer POC. Black Panther made his first appearance back in 1966, and it took 50 years for there to be a comic based primarily on two queer characters ... and it quickly got canceled. So yeah, those disappointed reactions? Completely justified. I might want better representation before I settle on any ol\u2019 thing, but I also know that when you\u2019re starving, table scraps are savored like a full-course meal.\n\nBut if there\u2019s something I want you to take away from this, it\u2019s that we\u2019re actually discussing queer women of color making a big-screen appearance, and we\u2019re being taken seriously. This scene has started something, and if Coogler puts as much effort into artfully portraying queerness as he did blackness, the future movies in the series will be the most intersectional thing in any movie-verse, not just Marvel\u2019s.\n\nI never thought my cynical, eye-rolling, \u201cOf course the queer scene got cut\u201d self would be saying this, but I think the forces behind this movie are capable of giving queer characters the respect they deserve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019re not there yet, but I think we can be in the future.", "keywords": ["emotions", "panther", "dont", "black", "representation", "ayo", "movie", "play", "okoye", "scene", "queer", "women", "think"], "polarity": 0.11899707996406107, "subjectivity": 0.4967954477388439},

However, the past few years have finally seen some cracks in the proverbial glass ceiling as black culture has permeated into the mainstream of the comic book universe. From Marvel\u2019s reimagining of classic rap album covers as comic book covers to the success of Black Lightning, Luke Cage and what is expected to be a massive bow at the box office for Black Panther, minorities in comic books are no longer a rarity in 2018.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s astounding to consider that it took this long for comic book publishers to recognize the appeal of black characters who are more than just sidekicks and henchmen. But with the buzz for Black Panther and seeing just how much a black character resonated with an audience, the door has been thrust wide open for more black characters who look, talk and act like us to be featured in this medium.\n\n\u201cRepresentation matters. The lack of representation also matters,\u201d comic book writer Bryan Edward Hill explains to The Root. \u201cStories ultimately tie back to mythology, and it\u2019s the way we rationalize good and evil. When you\u2019re not represented in stories, especially when you\u2019re not a protagonist or a hero, and you\u2019re confronted with that over and over again, subconsciously you start to question your own agency in the world.\u201d\n\nThe significance of black children and adults seeing themselves in comic books has long been undervalued by publishers. But with a diverse crop of black heroes (and anti-heroes) cropping up and finding success, films like Black Panther will hopefully become the norm and no longer outliers that we have to celebrate because we\u2019re unsure we\u2019ll ever see something like them again.\n\nHill\u2019s ongoing DC Comics series, Michael Cray, is one that will draw its fair share of attention because of the comic\u2019s unique narrative and the fact that it is written by a black man with a black title character and a black artist providing the visual element.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Cray is a fascinating story in which the title character is an assassin who exists in an alternate version of the DC universe and is tasked with hunting down evil versions of DC heroes, which include Arrow, the Flash and Aquaman.\n\n\u201cThe initial concept was pretty broad,\u201d Hill says of the spinoff to DC\u2019s The Wildstorm, by Warren Ellis. \u201c[Ellis] wanted me to tell a story of this guy who is in between masters and found a new organization that wanted him to take out evil versions of DC heroes. I was interested in the idea of not being able to trust your own consciousness and Cray\u2019s background as a guy who has received dogma his entire life. There\u2019s a story of a guy growing in power while simultaneously being a weapon for other people, and how those things come into conflict [is] really interesting.\u201d\n\nHill drew upon his own personal experiences as well as conversations with family and friends who had a military background to mold the personality of Cray.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI try to find real-world experience that I can insert into the work,\u201d he says. \u201cI was able to reach out to some people and get some stories about what it was like to hunt human beings for a living. From that research, I was able to paint a portrait that felt authentic to me. Then I layered it with my own life experience.\u201d\n\nAs for Hill\u2019s journey to this point, it\u2019s certainly been one that is unique in its own right.\n\nWith his father\u2019s untimely death due to cancer when he was 8, Hill desperately needed something to have faith in. After entering a comic book store and coming across a Batman comic that seemed to mirror his emotional weight of losing a parent, the St. Louis native found something to believe in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBruce Wayne was going through everything I was going through, but he was able to take that pain and turn it into something,\u201d Hill recalls. \u201cAs a kid, you are looking for your pathways and trying to figure out what is possible and what is impossible. For me, Batman became an instructive mythology on how to deal with grief, anger and all of those emotions.\u201d\n\nWith St. Louis admittedly not being a fertile ground for breeding African-American writers, Hill grew up enjoying comics but never really considered a career writing comics until later in life.\n\n\u201cI wanted to go into law enforcement,\u201d Hill reveals. \u201cI thought I was going to be an FBI agent, but my mother said, \u2018Nope, you can\u2019t have a gun so pick something else.\u2019 If I couldn\u2019t be an FBI agent, I wanted to tell stories. That led me to writing, and comics were always the most exciting stories you can read. I couldn\u2019t get that experience from any other forum.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter graduating from New York University film school, Hill worked as a freelance journalist before landing his first comic-writing job with Top Cow Productions in 2010. Since then, he\u2019s worked on a number of comics, including Witchblade, Postal and 7 Days From Hell.\n\nHe recognized early on that he was a black writer in a predominantly white space and needed to find a way to balance servicing the needs of readers with introducing characters of color.\n\n\u201cWhen I started writing, I knew that if you were to platform and agenda the task of writing characters of color and center them in fiction, you would have a very difficult path to be a professional,\u201d he says. \u201cEarly on, I would always balance things. There were less opportunities for writers of color and characters of color to be in these stories. This evolution that we\u2019ve had is a great thing. We\u2019re no longer telling a new generation what they can\u2019t do; they are growing up with a more wide-open field of participation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing at the helm of Michael Cray has been yet another balancing act for the 40-year-old. With a history of black characters being trapped in their own blackness, Hill sought to ensure that Cray was a black man with black experiences, but one who was not defined solely by those encounters.\n\n\u201cI know that as a black man, I don\u2019t wake up every day thinking about being black and filter every experience I have through a prism of race,\u201d Hill says. \u201cBut there tends to be a trend when you have characters of color that is the only thing they think about the entire time, and every conversation is governed by it. It\u2019s just not realistic. A lot of it is well-intentioned and broadens the conversation, but a lot of it left me cold because it doesn\u2019t feel real to me.\u201d\n\nRather than force Michael Cray\u2019s blackness into every conversation he has in the comic, Hill made it a point that while his character is black, it isn\u2019t all that the story is about. After all, Michael Cray is about a man who is hunting down a twisted version of the Flash. The psychology behind that alone is worth dissecting, and Hill manages to do that while making sure the reader is never misled into thinking that Michael Cray is anything but a black man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have more dimensions than [just being black],\u201d Hill says while looking toward the future in a post-Black Panther world. \u201cThat is the next evolution of characters of color. Allowing them to escape the gravitational pull of the story being about their race. We have other stories to tell. Being black is an element of the story, but we don\u2019t want to make his story only about that.\u201d", "keywords": ["writer", "writing", "black", "representation", "flash", "matter", "hill", "color", "michael", "explains", "comics", "edward", "kill", "characters", "cray", "comic", "book"], "polarity": 0.05555084426353084, "subjectivity": 0.5093901434386509},

Like loads of other filmgoers around the country, many of them arrived early and dressed in African-inspired garb to watch the movie.\n\nThe Sun notes what 22-year-old college student Tabitha Morgan wrote in an email:\n\n\u201cI was very pumped to go see the movie. Like ever since I first seen Angela Basset styling silvery white dreads, I knew I had to go see it,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOnce we arrived in Towson and just seeing people with African print skirts, dashikis, and Black affirmation shirts, I was so excited.\u201d\n\nBut that excitement soured later in the evening when, after some delays, attendees were told that all Black Panther screenings for that night would be canceled because of technical problems. One Twitter user mentioned waiting at the theater over an hour before being told that the movie wouldn\u2019t be shown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Jeanine Carter, a 33-year-old paralegal, told the Sun: \u201cThere was a lot of cussing. From myself and others.\u201d\n\nFilmgoers were given free movie passes for their trouble, but the event has some people scratching their heads.\n\nOne person who wrote to The Root said it was highly unlikely that the cinema would have issues with its reels, especially for a highly anticipated blockbuster that he points out had \u201csold out almost every show.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPatrick Kieley, a 31-year-old Towson native who, before working as an editor on movie trailers, worked in film distribution for five years, said that the digital cinema packages\u2014basically, the new film reels\u2014are always proofed when a theater receives them. For a blockbuster being shown on multiple screens, Kieley says, it\u2019s safe to assume that the theater would have backups.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way a large exhibitor like that would have technical issues at the last minute,\u201d Kieley said, adding that the whole thing \u201csmells really rotten.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo other film screenings were canceled, so it wasn\u2019t a theater-wide technical issue.

Perhaps it is my philosophical training. In my discipline, we do thought experiments. Meaning, we ask hypothetical questions in an attempt to get at a deeper truth. Last year, I did that with HBO\u2019s Game of Thrones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWord on these cyber streets is that a few Kappas tried to claim that T\u2019Challa would have carried a cane. I understand why. With a film dripping with melanin like Black Panther, it makes sense that black Greeks would see the character traits and see a bit of themselves in these heroic figures. However, we need to set the record straight. Below ...\n\n1. Nakia\n\nShe is beautiful. She is mysterious. She has a million different hairstyles. She is loyal to the king, but she refuses to commit to T\u2019Challa. Only an AKA could make a bazillionaire king who has the nicest ride on the planet walk around with his nose wide open. Curving guys is what AKAs do. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s in their constitution.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Okoye\n\nA fierce warrior and brilliant tactician who, when it came time to decide what to do at a moment of national crisis, followed the Wakandan version of Robert\u2019s Rules of Order. Okoye only wears sorority paraphernalia and is always with her line sisters, who are all collectively on a natural-hair journey. She would have been a Delta.\n\n\n\n3. Shuri\n\nThe precocious little sister of the king is, to my mind, the smartest person in the Marvel Universe. She may also turn out to be the most important. (Read Reginald Hudlin\u2019s run of the comic.) She is sarcastic, but cool under pressure. After graduating from Wakanda University\u2019s engineering program, Shuri pursued a degree in all the STEM (science, technology, engineering or math) fields. The princess of Wakanda would have joined Sigma Gamma Rho.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Ramonda\n\nRegal and wise, the queen of Wakanda is a woman who does not suffer fools. Stylish with beautiful, graying locs, Ramonda reminds me of a seasoned Zeta who visits the yard frequently because she is now a widow and keeps the young Zetas in line. Plus, Ramonda made Black Panther\u2019s purple drank from scratch, and we know all Zetas can cook.\n\n5. T\u2019Challa\n\nI\u2019m not saying this because I\u2019m a member, but the king would be an Alpha. Brilliant, empathetic, slightly nerdy, in love with the color black and awkward around beautiful women. Plus, T\u2019Challa was the president of Wakanda\u2019s NPHC and wanted his kingdom to be involved in a lot of community service\u2014yeah, that\u2019s us.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. N\u2019Jadaka (Killmonger)\n\nDid y\u2019all see the jacket and glasses this dude had on at the beginning of the movie? You see how he was, shall we say, a slayer of women? Notice his proclivity to wear no shirt with flashy, royal attire? Did you notice how his hair was ALWAYS laid\u2014even when he was fighting in water? Instead of a priceless artifact, he kept his eyes on a beautiful mask. In fact, Killmonger\u2019s entire existence in the movie was outfit-based. That nigga pretty; you read between the lines.\n\n7. M\u2019Baku\n\nThis is obvious. The leader of the Jabari Tribe would be a Que. Even the actor who plays M\u2019Baku agrees that he would\u2019ve been a Que. Not an Omega Man; a Que. In fact, that whole damn tribe is a tribe of Que Dawgs. They never wear shirts; they enter every party by barking; they love to fight; but, at their core, they are good-hearted, loyal brothers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, of course, the Jabari didn\u2019t care that they got kicked off the yard.\n\n8. W\u2019Kabi\n\nA royal adviser and head of security for the nation\u2019s border tribe, W\u2019Kabi is an important member of Wakanda\u2019s inner circle. He is always lurking in the background, paying close attention to events as they unfold. His loyalty to family can, at times, do more harm than good\u2014and he is awfully fond of the color blue. He would have been a Sigma.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Zuri\n\nHe is important to the story, but he wasn\u2019t around much. The only reason people knew that Zuri was in a fraternity is that he showed up any time the other frats had an event.

Luckily, our editor-in-chief, Danielle Belton, was able to score tickets so that we could be there to give you our impressions of the film. (Although we\u2019re not too spoilery, if you\u2019re afraid to know too much, it might be better to see the movie first.)\n\n\n\nDanielle Belton, Editor-in-Chief\n\nFor most of Black Panther, I couldn\u2019t believe what I was watching. An African nation that was never colonized? Two black women talking to each other about their mission and not, I dunno, either not talking at all or talking about a man? Moments that went on forever where no white characters spoke, or where they were summarily chastised for speaking? Black women who were fully realized characters with agency and their own beliefs? Black men who were completely confident and actualized in their ideals, even if the viewpoints were opposing and varied? A cinematic parallel for the real-world tensions and conflicts that often exist between Africans and African Americans? Black people who were the victors and not victims? What!\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat did I just watch?\u201d was all I could think after I saw it, but in a good way\u2014but also in a sad way, in that I\u2019m 40 and a lifelong movie lover who\u2019s seen almost every clich\u00e9 in cinema; but Black Panther took clich\u00e9 and chucked it off a waterfall, making me wonder why Hollywood is so lazy and often afraid of new ideas that it took this long to see a black film like this, on this scale.\n\nBut ultimately, I want to see more. I want there to be a sequel (I\u2019d love to see where things go in Wakanda after the actions of this film), but I also want there to be more blockbuster movies that take risks and tell new stories. Lastly, I want people to respect assigned seating in theaters. One dude in our theater almost ruined the entire movie because he did not want to find his ... probably crappy ... seat. But nobody has time for this game of seat leap frog. Not today.\n\n\n\nGenetta M. Adams, Managing Editor\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been this hyped for a movie. And in this age when the most eager fans can line up the night before the official opening to see a movie, I\u2019ve rarely felt the urge to be among the first paying customers to see a film\u2014until now.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the splendor and beauty of Wakanda washed over me, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what Africa would\u2019ve looked like if it had never been invaded by colonizers. What if the continent\u2019s vast riches were never stolen and the plunder of black bodies never happened? Black Panther offers the best version of that possibility.\n\n\n\nThe eye-popping fashion was even more amazing on the big screen (and if costume designer Ruth E. Carter isn\u2019t nominated for ALL the awards, I\u2019m boycotting award shows forever). And the storyline (again, the screenplay and director Ryan Coogler better be up for ALL the awards) is so timely and relevant that I actually felt empathy for the \u201cvillain\u201d Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan).\n\n\n\nAnd though the movie is called Black Panther, it is the black women of Wakanda\u2014from the fiercest warriors of the Dora Milaje to Shuri (Letitia Wright), the brilliant scientist who develops Wakanda\u2019s tech (and delivers the funniest lines in the movie), and the calm, regal beauty of Queen Mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett)\u2014who give the movie its heart. I wish my 12-year-old self could have seen such badass black women so prominently featured in a big-budget action movie. And I know that 12-year-old black girls who see the movie today will feel inspired and empowered by these black women, and encouraged to pursue their dreams, no matter what.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLook for me in the line as I hit the theater a few more times to bask in the glorious world of Wakanda.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nAngela Helm, Contributing Editor\n\nI was hopeful but a little bit afraid of the hype surrounding Black Panther (see Empire three years ago). I shouldn\u2019t have been. It was every single thing. Big-budget action. Drama. Comic relief. And an all-encompassing, well-lit blackness that flew off the screen and overwhelmed my senses.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere will be much said about Killmonger, a complicated character who had one of the most powerful lines of the film (I gasped when he said it, and then threw a hand in the air), but what I loved most about him was that although he graduated from the Naval Academy at 19 and went to MIT, he was still so Oakland with his gold teeth and unrepentant brilliance.\n\n\n\nThe white gaze was nonexistent. This was for us, by us and quite possibly a game changer for cinema. I cannot wait for my unborn grandchildren to see it. Wakanda forever.\n\nCorey Townsend, Weekend Social Editor\n\nOne word: FASHION! The looks that were served in Black Panther sent me into a state of euphoria. The bold patterns served as a reminder that color was indeed invented for those with melanin.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe movie also served as a reminder that the world would be lost without black women!\n\nTerrell Jermaine Starr, Senior Reporter\n\nAs soon as I stepped out of the movie theater, I was no longer in Wakanda. And that made me sad. I was forced to share an UberPool with two colonizers. I wanted to yell \u201cColonizers!\u201d and ask them for their tourist visas, but I could not. We weren\u2019t in Wakanda. Nor am I Shuri. I am joking, but I\u2019m really not.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more than two hours, I was surrounded by blackness, consumed with a power of self and possibility I\u2019d never experienced during a film. For two hours, whiteness was not centered. I was. It was challenging to wrestle with that reality and the possibilities of such a world because I was born into a reality where whiteness is the default. My struggles, my successes, my dreams are all predicated on fending off and negotiating with whiteness. In Wakanda, whiteness negotiates with me and has few options but to comply.\n\nThat is a wonderful feeling. I have never watched a Marvel film\u2014nor am I a comics fan\u2014but that has changed. Black Panther left me with a buoyancy about what our current world strives to make impossible: a world centered in blackness, our existence. There are no bells and whistles to Wakanda. It just was. For two hours, so was I. I just was.\n\nNow I am in America, where just being is a struggle. I long for Wakanda.\n\nDanielle Young, Producer\n\nThis is my second time seeing Black Panther, and it won\u2019t be my last. My emotions are not done with this movie. It not only lives up to the epic hype but also pens the only love letter to Diasporic blackness that you\u2019ll ever need. When I got a chance to watch the movie the first time, I wrote a spoiler-free review that allowed me to dig into the black pride this movie undeniably gifts you. Watching T\u2019Challa\u2019s (Chadwick Boseman) baby sister, Shuri, bounce around her lab, brilliantly leading Wakanda\u2019s tech, made me feel like a little girl watching her new role model. Representation matters, and there\u2019s nothing quite like showing little black girls and boys that tech is a possibility for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are just so many good parts, pieces, moments, visuals, everything, but Killmonger is another standout. Obviously, Michael B. Jordan is ribbed for our pleasure, but his portrayal of a villain is delicious. His character is so well-rounded, so wounded and almost right in his attempt to dethrone King T\u2019Challa. And having his character represent black America in the sense of longing to reach home, the Motherland, was so uncomfortably beautiful. The only thing I have left to say about Black Panther is thank you for ...\u201dcolonizer.\u201d\n\nP.J. Rickards, Video Producer\n\nI\u2019ve been taking my 12-year-old son to see superhero movies for years now. It\u2019s definitely his thing: the opening, big action scenes, the one-liners, the larger-than-life graphics and the excitement after. It hit me while watching Black Panther: We\u2019re going to share that with a movie about a black superhero, strong black characters in a remarkable, all-black world. I already felt that way after seeing the trailer, but it was a whole other thing when I got to finally experience the full movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll I could think about was how he would react at certain parts and the discussions it could open up. And to see it with black people proud and dressed up. It reminded me a bit of the level of pride when Malcolm X came out and everyone was wearing X hats and dashikis. You could tell it was made with love by people of color for our people. It also made me hopeful that this will continue to be a regular occurrence, and even though it\u2019s a big deal for the grown-ups, the impact on young people growing up might be greater than we think.\n\nJason Johnson, Politics Editor\n\nI still don\u2019t know what the heck I saw, and I\u2019ve seen the movie three times. All I know is that I was fighting back thug tears every time Killmonger spoke, and this might\u2019ve been the first time in my life that I sat in a mostly black theater and people only made noise at the appropriate times. The other thing I know is this: it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s week and Black History Month, so if you bought us Black Panther tickets this weekend, we go together \u2026.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAshley Velez, Digital Video Producer\n\nBlack Panther made me feel so many things. I\u2019ve shouted \u201cWakanda forever!\u201d too many times to count since last night. Not only was Black Panther visually stunning\u2014from the cinematography to the lighting and costume design\u2014but the writing was also incredibly executed and engaging. It created space for film watchers to have meaningful dialogue surrounding things like generational trauma, conflicting methods of liberation, and identity throughout the Diaspora. Nothing about how these themes was presented felt forced, which is where modern films and television tend to drop the ball.\n\nI really appreciated the fact that Black Panther didn\u2019t feel like it solely revolved around T\u2019Challa\u2019s mental and physical conflicts. The bulk of the characters were elevated in sincere ways. Because of this, I was able to connect with multiple characters throughout the film. I still can\u2019t decide if I want to be Okoye (Danai Gurira), Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) or Shuri! That alone speaks to the significance of how black women were portrayed throughout the film.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh yeah, listen to the soundtrack again after watching the movie! I appreciated it so much more!\n\n\n\nA final note: If you\u2019re a colonizer, I feel bad for you, son.\n\nPsych. No, I don\u2019t.\n\nAnne Branigin, News Fellow\n\nBefore the film, I kept thinking about how Black Panther came out almost a year after Get Out. Wakanda is in some ways the antithesis of \u201cthe sunken place.\u201d Where the latter expressed a loss of control\u2014being at the mercy of \u201cbenevolent\u201d whiteness\u2014Wakanda represents liberation and self-determination in a powerful way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mother\u2019s country has been colonized twice: first by the Spanish, then by the U.S. Although one of our national heroes killed one of the world\u2019s greatest colonizers, Ferdinand Magellan, the enduring evidence of their actions is in our names, food, features, vocabulary. I love how Black Panther imagines a land written off as a Third World country as being, instead, a superpower\u2014a land free from colonization and subjugation. I love the questions it asks\u2014about what we could be if we got to keep the most precious parts of ourselves, and about the responsibility associated with that.\n\n", "keywords": ["watching", "live", "panther", "black", "forever", "movie", "thing", "love", "night", "opening", "world", "film", "went", "women", "wakanda"], "polarity": 0.11046091495310241, "subjectivity": 0.48518148518148513},

I still don\u2019t think I\u2019ve fully processed or fully understand what impact this movie is going to have on people\u2019s lives. So I\u2019m excited.\u201d \u2014Douriean\n\nJewelry designer and metalsmith Douriean Fletcher\u2014who designs and retails simply as Douriean\u2014is having the kind of breakthrough moment most artists can\u2019t even begin to dream of. Handpicked by friend and legendary costume designer Ruth E. Carter to join the costume team of Black Panther (the two previously worked together on 2016\u2019s Roots), Douriean\u2019s handcrafted jewelry and metalwork adorn the citizens and royalty of Wakanda\u2014perhaps most dazzlingly as the armor and neckpieces of the incredible warrior women of the Dora Milaje.\n\nWatching her own work in action was a thrilling experience, as Douriean told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nSeeing the movie, it was an absolute joy to see this glistening armor just pop off the screen. ... These Dora characters are the first defense of Wakanda; they\u2019re the ones that defend the honor and the safety of the country. So I think I didn\u2019t really fully process what that meant\u2014that I was creating those pieces\u2014until I saw the movie the other day. The actual craftsmanship of those pieces was a very interesting yet challenging experience ... these pieces have a meaning. They have a specific meaning of who these women are, and what they do for their country. They\u2019re there to be resilient and strong, and to protect Wakanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m inspired and intrigued by how we choose to represent ourselves as resilient and beautiful and functional, regardless of what we\u2019ve experienced in life.\u201d\n\nDouriean\u2019s handmade, often hand-hammered aesthetic was a perfect match for this newest cinematic corner of the Marvel Universe, which introduces us to the technologically advanced, culturally rich fictional African nation of Wakanda. Douriean, who considers her work not only Afrofuturistic but \u201cAncient Futuristic\u201d or \u201cPrimal Chic,\u201d welcomed the challenge to translate her artistic aesthetic to the big screen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDouriean explained:\n\nI feel like I have a lot of responsibility, first off, to communicate a certain message through my work. I feel like it\u2019s a lot of responsibility, but I think it\u2019s a great position to be in. ... But I think as far as the Marvel Universe, it\u2019s a perfect match because I was able to bring something different to this culture of Wakanda, this fictional country that they had yet to really tap into.\n\nCostume designer Carter agreed, telling The Glow Up that she\u2019d specifically chosen Douriean because she felt strongly that the metal pieces used in Black Panther had to have a \u201chand-tooled African, hand-hammered\u201d aesthetic. That, coupled with director Ryan Coogler\u2019s desire for even the armor to look like beautiful African jewelry, made Douriean the ideal choice. The jewelry designer confessed to us that initially, she held back in deference to the Marvel aesthetic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[Ruth E. Carter] said, \u2018This isn\u2019t Douriean enough. You have to put more of yourself in it.\u2019 That was exciting. Like, oh, wait, you\u2019re giving me some space to do my thing,\u201d Douriean said.\n\nA Pasadena, Calif., native, Douriean has been creating jewelry since 2010. She is mostly self-taught, save for a three-month metalsmithing class in New Orleans. Having traveled throughout Tanzania and South Africa and now based in Los Angeles, she makes work that \u201cexplores cultural identity, femininity, spirituality and divine power.\u201d When asked where she gleans her inspiration, she told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nSometimes it\u2019s my story; if I experience something that\u2019s quite challenging, I\u2019ll take inspiration from that\u2014and, sometimes, motivation from those experiences\u2014and put that into a piece. Sometimes I literally just have dreams, and I wake up in the middle of night and sketch them out. And sometimes other people\u2019s stories, or just their essence ... women, we\u2019re very multifaceted creatures. So I\u2019m inspired and intrigued by how we choose to represent ourselves as resilient and beautiful and functional, regardless of what we\u2019ve experienced in life. ... The physique of a woman is very beautiful, and I want\u2014whenever I create something\u2014to be able to adorn someone to where they feel regal and beautiful and powerful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a female metalsmith, Douriean admitted that her eight-year journey has been a challenge, as there aren\u2019t many women in the field, let alone black women. But she credits the obstacles with her growth as an artist and innovator:\n\n\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve been underestimated at times; people are just surprised that I can create what I do, or doubt that I can create what I make. And because it\u2019s so different from what people think when they think of jewelry-making, it\u2019s been a challenge to find my niche and my clientele. Like this whole entire process, like this is the first time\u2014these past two years\u2014where I feel like I\u2019ve finally found my tribe and my clientele of people who can understand and accept my work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith that growth and increasing exposure have come major shifts for Douriean, especially as the officially licensed jewelry designer for both Black Panther and the upcoming Avengers film, which promises to be an even larger production. While creating for mass market raises her exposure and reach, it definitely presented challenges to her typically one-of-a-kind approach to design. According to Douriean:\n\nAs an artist, I like to create one-offs\u2014I like to create one thing, it has a story to it, it means something and it\u2019s for one particular person. To be able to have to expand that, and create a narrative for a group of people, it\u2019s a different way of approaching my work. So, for instance, the Black Panther line ... I created that, number one, for the comic book fan; the young men and women or the young boys and girls who grew up on the comics, who are super excited, who have been waiting for this moment for years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those of us coveting a piece of Black Panther to take home, the sterling silver Black Panther collection is currently available on Douriean\u2019s website. A collection inspired by Panther villain Killmonger is next, and lastly, a collection inspired by the Dora Milaje, which Douriean will handcraft herself.\n\nThe Glow Up caught a preview of both Lupita Nyong\u2019o and the designer herself at the Marvel Studios Black Panther Welcome to Wakanda New York Fashion Week presentation on Monday. Frankly, we can\u2019t wait to see if 24-karat-gold neck rings and epaulets are in our futures. The designer was coy:\n\n\u201cI wanted the Dora pieces to be very special, so I\u2019m handcrafting all of those. So it\u2019s coming. It\u2019s coming,\u201d she told us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut right now, Douriean is just savoring the moment and trying to process how it feels to become part of cinematic history:", "keywords": ["douriean", "panther", "black", "create", "adorned", "feel", "designer", "work", "jeweler", "jewelry", "heavy", "women", "armored", "metal", "think"], "polarity": 0.2566777954749653, "subjectivity": 0.5426845952789348},

It has nothing to do with my dislike for you or your people. In fact, some of my best friends are white. Well ... one of my best friends is white. OK, I\u2019ll be honest, all of my best friends are black, but one of them is kinda light-skinned, and when I was in the 11th grade, I went to a New Edition concert with three Caucasian classmates, so that should count for something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut my hesitancy in penning this correspondence is based on another fact: I didn\u2019t believe you were real. I didn\u2019t discount your existence the way I don\u2019t believe in unicorns, good cops or Rihanna. (Yeah, I said it. I believe Rih Rih is a highly advanced, computer-generated image based on our collective fantasies. You might think it\u2019s crazy, but I stand by my research.)\n\nWhen people told me that there were actual individuals upset about the upcoming Marvel movie Black Panther, I thought they were exaggerating or overestimating the number. I suspect there are always a few fringe kooks who share an idiotic ideology.\n\nKyrie Irving and B.o.B think the Earth is flat. Some people believe that Donald Trump is both stable and a genius. And once, on the dance floor of a crowded nightclub, a woman told me I was handsome and cute. (At least that\u2019s what I think she said, although she may have said, \u201cYou\u2019re standing on my foot.\u201d It was pretty crowded and I\u2019d consumed a few beverages. But for the sake of this argument, let\u2019s just say it was the cute thing.) My point here is, sometimes people have wildly diverging opinions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust as I was ready to dismiss the notion that there might be more than a handful of people who disliked the notion of a Black Panther movie before they even saw it, someone sent me a transcript of Rush Limbaugh ranting about liberals embracing Black Panther.\n\nI honestly get why Limbaugh was upset. If I were a half-deaf, impotent walrus who had to sit in front of a microphone yelling to white senior citizens who still listen to AM radio while popping Oxycontin like Tic Tacs during commercial breaks, I\u2019d probably be a little jealous of T\u2019Challa, too. Plus, Limbaugh is racist, and the film does have the words \u201cBlack\u201d and \u201cPanther\u201d in it, so .... there\u2019s that.\n\nBut people kept sending me things. There was a story calling Black Panther \u201cobviously racist,\u201d a Breitbart article that called the comic book \u201cBlack Lives Matter-themed,\u201d and that piece where Ben Shapiro crumpled into a rice-paper-thin ball of fuckboy fragility in a nonsensical monologue about how this is the fault of black people, leftists and, of course, Barack Obama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, that\u2019s only three racists people.\n\nAnd then, like a fool, I ventured into the land of white nonsense where coffee machines and Bluetooth speakers somehow have all colluded to form a plot to eradicate the great arrhythmic race: Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s Twitter,\u201d I reasoned. White people on Twitter are like the Incredible Hulk when he\u2019s off his meds: They\u2019ll get mad at anything. Then I happened upon this well-reasoned discourse between writer Zack Linly and a random Facebooker:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can understand why some white people are upset. After all, I distinctly recall how upset black people were about Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, When Harry Met Sally, Twilight, Terminator and The Passion of the Christ (yes, they literally made a movie about Jesus with no black people!).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, the above-mentioned movies were not comic book movies. Making a film about a superhero from an all-black place is an egregious offense. Especially since Marvel put so much detail into making sure its other superhero movies had diverse casts.\n\nI recall how the white outrage forced Hollywood into casting a South American actress to play Wonder Woman, since she was from a fictional race of Amazonian warriors. (I didn\u2019t Google it, but I\u2019m pretty sure Gal Gadot is from Brazil or somewhere. If she were Israeli or something, it would mean white people didn\u2019t care about the ethnicity of comic book characters until a black one came around and triggered their racist ... you know what? I\u2019m not even going there. She\u2019s gotta be from Mexico or Australia, or wypipo would look very stupid right now.) We really thank you for making sure they include black actors every time they flash back to Superman\u2019s home planet of Krypton.\n\nPlus, I\u2019m probably making up the white outcry when someone floated the idea that Donald Glover might be the next Superman, or Idris Elba could play James Bond. I probably imagined that wypipo were upset about John Boyega playing a Stormtrooper, just like I dreamed about Rihanna or that woman who thought I was handsome. (I\u2019m pretty sure she said \u201chandsome and cute,\u201d not \u201cstanding on my foot.\u201d I mean ... I was actually standing on her foot, but that\u2019s neither here nor there.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause white people have repeatedly stood up for inclusion and diversity in casting, we would like to admit that this is our fault. Forgive us for being excited that there is finally a movie that caters to our sensibilities without kowtowing to the notion of a white savior.\n\nI tell you what we\u2019ll do. To make this up to you, we promise that we will remain marginalized, mostly ancillary characters in most of the Hollywood blockbusters for the rest of the year. We also swear that we will allow you to win and be nominated for the bulk of Oscars, Golden Globes, Emmys, Tony Awards, Peabody Awards, Billboard Awards, MTV Awards, America\u2019s Got Talent, spelling bees, luge races, school shootings, mass murders, police-shooting trials, Senate races and rose ceremonies on The Bachelor.\n\nI don\u2019t want there to be any hard feelings.

The piece claimed that the family of a woman, who has now been revealed as Jocelyn Savage, believes that Kelly was running a sex cult in which women were not allowed to contact their families. The article also claimed that the singer didn\u2019t allow the women to wear revealing clothing or speak to other men. If you haven\u2019t read it, take time to do so; it\u2019s troubling.\n\nR. Kelly has come out against the allegations and Savage has come forward to tell TMZ that she is, in fact, OK:\n\nThe video was supposed to assure readers of the initial article that Savage was not a member of a cult.

I haven\u2019t reviewed captive videos before, but my layman\u2019s experience tells me that Savage doesn\u2019t seem very forthcoming with information. In fact, one could argue that Savage is being coached off camera.\n\nGo back and watch the footage. When the TMZ interviewer asks Savage why she believes that her family has asked for a welfare check now, Savage starts to answer the question and then looks up off camera and says she doesn\u2019t want to answer the question. She also refuses to answer whether she\u2019s in Georgia, whether she\u2019s living with roommates, and whether she can come and go as she pleases\u2014all questions that a noncaptive would answer freely, one would assume.\n\nInternet sleuths have also reported that a shadow can be seen on Savage\u2019s shirt top, confirming that someone is behind the camera and, thus, coaching Savage through her answers. Savage\u2019s behavior appears, at the least, to be captive-esque.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the bigger question for me is, what does a 50-year-old man with a history of sexually predatory behavior surrounding him like stench off a garbage dump want with a 21-year-old? More importantly, why does he have her around when her family insists that she is being held captive? If you aren\u2019t holding her captive, then why aren\u2019t you encouraging her to visit and call her family?\n\nAlso, WHY IS A 50-YEAR-OLD MAN HOUSING A 21-YEAR-OLD? Why does he have a friendship with a 21-year-old? Why does he have her living in or near him? Why are there several women alleging the same thing? What will it take for young black women\u2019s lives to matter more than a slow jam?\n\nNever forget that during the height of R.

The portraits, by Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald respectively\u2014both black painters\u2014are such sharp departures from any previous depictions of a president and first lady that reviews were understandably mixed, even amongst our own crew here at The Root (including yours truly).\n\n\n\nEspecially when considering Mrs. Obama\u2019s portrait, it took a moment to reconcile her portrayal with our expectations. Where was the warmth we\u2019d become so accustomed to during the Obama era? The radiant smile? The glorious brown skin?\n\nWhile Wiley\u2019s portrait of our 44th President\u2019s portrait seemed lush and even playful\u2014if whimsically unconventional for a leader of the free world\u2014Sherald\u2019s portrait of his wife, posed similarly to Rodin\u2019s The Thinker, seemed to almost recede by comparison, like a cherished photograph that had already faded much too soon for our comfort. To some of us, it seemed more like a suggestion of our favorite first lady, rather than a portrait of the lady herself.\n\nAnd yet, in the days since\u2014for this writer, at least\u2014it has been difficult not to return to look at it again and again.\n\nAs Doreen St. Felix wrote in a wonderful analysis for the New Yorker:\n\nThe racializing schema of Sherald\u2019s work is to \u2018exclude the idea of color as race,\u2019 she has said, in her artist\u2019s statement. To Sherald, the photorealistic depiction of race\u2014a quality determined by others\u2019 eyes, externally\u2014is a dead end. Applied to Michelle Obama, the lack of brown in the skin feels first like a loss, and then like a real gain. This is a different Michelle, a woman evacuated of celebrity, who appears provisionally dreamlike, nearly a shadow. The mouth and the eyes and the strong arms that we know are present, but fainter. From some distance, I can imagine, the figure might not be immediately recognizable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf the many things that have been written about Mrs. Obama\u2019s portrait since its unveiling last Monday, several articles have focused on the dress she chose to be immortalized in, made by American (semi)affordable luxury label Milly, designed by Michelle Smith. Indeed, it is the most visually striking element of the portrait, featuring graphic-patterned patches in black, red, yellow, pink and beige, scattered across the white foreground of the skirt. It drapes across Mrs. Obama\u2019s lap in much the same way I remember quilts draping across my Mississippian great-grandmother\u2019s lap decades ago.\n\nMany have been quick to make the same comparison, especially noting similarities between Mrs. Obama\u2019s dress and the famously graphic geometric quilts created for over a century in Gee\u2019s Bend, Alabama. At the unveiling, artist Amy Sherald spoke to the similarities herself, saying:\n\nThe dress chosen for this painting was designed by Milly. It has an abstract pattern that reminded me of the Dutch artist Piet Mondrian\u2019s geometric paintings. But Milly\u2019s design also resembles the inspired quilt masterpieces made by the women of Gee\u2019s Bend, a small remote black community in Alabama where they compose quilts in geometries that transform clothes and fabric remnants into masterpieces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut designer Smith apparently had no such correlation in mind when she created the print. She spoke to Vogue about the dress, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s made of a stretch cotton poplin print in a clean, minimal, geometric print without a reference to anything past or nostalgic, which gives the dress a very forward-thinking sensibility\u2014this is very Michelle Obama.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut while Michelle Smith may not have read a metaphor for quilting in her own work, is it safe for her to assume that a woman as aware and astute as Michelle Obama\u2014well known for her strategic sartorial statements\u2014didn\u2019t? Aside from evoking the great American southern tradition of quilting\u2014as well as the stars and stripes famously handsewn for this country\u2014is it so outlandish to consider that her gown might also evoke the racial patchwork that comprises the country her husband so recently led?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo glean more insight, The Glow Up spoke with textile artist, clothing designer, children\u2019s book author and illustrator, and master quilter Cozbi Cabrera, a 2017 Lincoln Center artist-in-residence whose own quilts have been shown in the Myrtle Beach Art Museum, concurrent with an exhibit on the quilters of Gee\u2019s Bend. Like many others, she isn\u2019t so quick to discredit the correlation between the white American designer dress and the black American South.\n\nWell, I think for starters that designers have to be aware that they are influenced greatly, and that fashion overall is derivative. So, whether we are doing it consciously or subconsciously, there is something about putting all of these elements together that\u2019s going to strike a chord or trigger a memory or something. So, I think that she\u2019s probably not being\u2014I wouldn\u2019t even use the word \u2018truthful\u2019\u2014I think that she\u2019s probably not being aware of this idea that fashion is derivative. So, it comes from somewhere. And I think that rightfully so, [Amy Sherald\u2019s] notion of her choice is very telling as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCabrera is also quick to note the very \u201cAmerican story\u201d of Gee\u2019s Bend, an isolated peninsula about 35 miles southwest of Selma, Alabama, with a population of less than 300, according to the 2010 Census. Primarily African-American and reachable almost exclusively by ferry, in 1965, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. visited the enclave three weeks before Selma\u2019s \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d to encourage voter registration. However, three years before, Alabama\u2019s government had shut down ferry service to nearby Camden, further isolating the community from basic necessities like medical attention, employment, and participation in the democratic process.\n\nAnd yet, even in isolation, their traditions continued. In 2002, the Whitney Museum in New York mounted a show of the quilts of Gee\u2019s Bend, to rave reviews. The New York Times\u2019 art critic called them \u201ceye-poppingly gorgeous,\u201d while others marveled at the fact that these modernist creations could have generated within a place seemingly cut off from inspiration, as Cabrera notes:\n\n[T]heir quilts showed up at the Whitney Museum in New York, and the reviews came back that what they were doing rivaled anything that you\u2019d find in 20th-century art. ... how could it be? How could they have these sophisticated influences if they were in isolation? And it\u2019s almost like an assumption that the creator\u2014or what I would call the Divine\u2014sort of sprinkles sophistication and aesthetic instincts only on a particular group of people, in only a particular geographic location, you know?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilarly, Cabrera believes it may be short-sighted to underestimate the deep significance and skill in Sherald\u2019s portrait of Michelle Obama\u2014or to assume the former First Lady\u2019s intentions in choosing her for the commission. Because ultimately, isn\u2019t art\u2014like beauty\u2014in the eye of the beholder?\n\nI think that in a less masterful hand, most people have a tendency to kind of throw in the kitchen sink, and in my mind, [Sherald] made some very deliberate choices as to what to leave out and what was left was the likeness of Michelle Obama. So we got that it was her\u2014you know it was quite a bit of fluidity of line, and then these elements of patch. All that\u2019s left in my mind visually were the essentials to kind of like, tell the story. How [Milly designer Michelle Smith] might feel about that, I think it\u2019s almost not even relevant because I think that the larger community got what was being communicated. And so, I think that\u2019s why you keep hearing, again and again, this notion of [the] quilt. I think that there\u2019s a language that we all understand, and that\u2019s what you get with people groups; like the things that don\u2019t have to be spoken but are understood. ... It\u2019s not uncanny that the community is saying similar things along a similar vein, because we do have this common understanding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those of us whom, at first glance, might have wanted something more colorful and dramatic from our first black First Lady, perhaps it\u2019s worth taking a beat, and considering who Michelle Obama really is, as Cabrera\u2019s deft analysis reminds us:\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s the visual equivalent of a stage whisper, which draws more attention to itself.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["portrait", "dress", "black", "included", "bend", "picture", "gees", "quilts", "michelle", "lady", "obama", "think"], "polarity": 0.147996758631087, "subjectivity": 0.42747813960500525},

But since we here at The Glow Up sit at the intersection of Fashion Week and Black History Month (and Wakanda, obvi), we couldn\u2019t help noticing another trend rising the past few seasons: a surge in blackness-branded clothing we haven\u2019t seen since the early \u201990s (more on that trend to come).\n\n\n\nWhat was really striking to us was the re-emergence of our two primary civil rights icons, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr., as the focus of two clothing lines this season: the Malcolm X Legacy collection, which debuted at Harlem Fashion Week 2018, and recent releases from New York-based skateboarding brand Supreme, whose latest lookbook features clothing emblazoned with MLK\u2019s visage and most famous phrases: \u201cI have a dream\u201d and \u201cWe shall overcome.\u201d\n\nSuffice it to say, reviews on the much-better-known Supreme collection were mixed, especially among The Root crew. Our internal\u2014and anonymous\u2014staff discussions went something like this:\n\n\u201cThis is ridiculous. The King family is a mess for authorizing this.\u201d \u201cCash grab.\u201d \u201cMy beef with it is ... why is it so hideous? It looks like some shit you\u2019d see for sale on the side of the road ... or at a swamp meet.\u201d [Editor\u2019s note: Yes, she meant \u201cswamp.\u201d] \u201cThere will be no Supreme-bashing on my watch ... aka my favorite brand right now. Although I must admit that this morning\u2019s lookbook was sad, and the MLK hoodie was one of the better pieces in a sad way. ... Supreme has honored several blacks in the past, including the great Pam Grier ... Sade, Muhammad Ali, KRS-One, Malcolm X ... MLK fits that mold, even if that all-over print sweatshirt is fugazi.\u201d \u201cThe Sade was fresh. This was a mess. It looked like something I\u2019d be forced to buy if I caught a chill at Jazz Fest ... and I\u2019d stay cold.\u201d \u201cI think MLK on the arms was overkill. Never put MLK on the arms.\u201d \u201cThat sweatshirt was all the velvet paintings and airbrushed backdrops of MLK that ever were.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK. So that release was considered less than \u201csupreme\u201d around these parts. But not to be outdone, the jewel in the crown that was 2018 Harlem Fashion Week was the debut of the Malcolm X Legacy collection, co-helmed by the six daughters of Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz\u2014Qubilah, Attallah, Ilyasah, Malikah, Gamilah and Malaak Shabazz. Instead of simply licensing their father\u2019s words and image to an existing brand, the Shabazz sisters teamed up with tech company Hingeto and emerging designer Yvonne Jewnell to collaborate on a clothing line that pays homage to their father\u2019s legacy.\n\nThe contemporary urbanwear line features clothing inspired by the 12 principles of Malcolm X, which stressed the importance of human rights, education, economic independence, cultural pride and justice. The Shabazz sisters created the collection in hopes of inspiring a younger generation of activists to follow in their father\u2019s steps.\n\nThe Glow Up\u2019s editorial team (supermodel Veronica Webb and myself) had the pleasure of being front row at the debut of the Malcolm X Legacy collection at the inaugural event of Harlem Fashion Week on Feb. 4, a sold-out runway presentation at the gorgeous Museum of the City of New York. We can vouch for the fact that these are definitely clothes for a new generation of Malcolm X followers\u2014fresh, funky, fashion-forward and sexier than expected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while we both enjoyed the presentation, we\u2019ll let you judge for yourselves this round.

The licensor of King\u2019s estate, which approves the use of his words and likeness, is Intellectual Properties Management Inc. Dexter Scott King, the iconic civil rights leader\u2019s youngest son, is the group\u2019s CEO.\n\nEarlier:\n\nIt was an ad so incongruous with what Martin Luther King Jr. stood for that it beggared belief.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Super Bowl ad for Dodge Ram pickup trucks featured a voice-over from MLK\u2019s \u201cDrum Major Instinct\u201d speech. The speech, which extolled the value of service and warned of the dangers of capitalism and marketing, was delivered by King in Atlanta on Feb. 4, 1968, just months before he would be assassinated.\n\nIn the ad, which aired on the 50th anniversary of the original speech, you can hear King\u2019s distinctive cadence delivering the words: \u201cIf you want to be important, wonderful. If you want to be recognized, wonderful. If you want to be great, wonderful. But recognize that he who is greatest among you shall be a servant.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs he says this, a black Dodge Ram barrels in slow motion through the mud onto the screen, wipers gliding across the windshield.\n\nService, ladies and gentleman. Available with no money down at your nearest Chrysler dealer.\n\nThe ad was immediately blasted\u2014and the King Center and Bernice King, MLK\u2019s daughter, made clear they had had nothing to do with the ad. In fact, the King Center said that neither it nor Bernice King has the right to approve MLK\u2019s words or image \u201cfor use in merchandise, entertainment ... or advertisement.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany Twitter users pointed out that the rest of the speech actually warned against the harms of capitalism\u2014which is to say, being persuaded to \u201ckeep up with the Joneses\u201d and living beyond your means. The irony was so rich, someone even overlaid the ad with a portion of King\u2019s speech in which he mentioned how people are \u201cso taken by advertisers ... those gentlemen of massive verbal persuasion.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey have a way of saying things to you that kind of gets you into buying,\u201d King can be heard saying in the alternate version. \u201cIn order to be a man of distinction, you must drink this whiskey. In order to make your neighbors envious, you must drive this type of car.\u201d\n\nOr, you know, if you want your friends and family to know you\u2019re about that service life, buy a Dodge Ram.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, it\u2019s worthwhile to note that the ad also features military servicemen prominently, another image that doesn\u2019t jibe all the way with King\u2019s moral compass\u2014he was anti-imperialist and was staunchly against the Vietnam War for that reason.\n\nSo who let this happen? The famously litigious King estate\u2014which, again, neither the King Center nor Bernice King has any control over. Slate magazine reports that Eric D. Tidwell, managing director of Intellectual Properties Management Inc.\u2014the \u201cexclusive licensor\u201d of King\u2019s estate, and whose CEO is Dexter Scott King\u2014said in a statement that the estate was \u201cpleasantly surprised at the existence of the Ram Nation volunteers and their efforts.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore from Tidwell\u2019s statement:\n\nWe learned that as a volunteer group of Ram owners, they serve others through everything from natural disaster relief, to blood drives, to local community volunteer initiatives. Once the final creative was presented for approval, it was reviewed to ensure it met our standard integrity clearances. We found that the overall message of the ad embodied Dr. King\u2019s philosophy that true greatness is achieved by serving others. Thus we decided to be a part of Ram\u2019s \u201cBuilt to Serve\u201d Super Bowl program.\ufeff\n\nTo borrow the parlance from one iconic Tyra Banks/America\u2019s Next Top Model meme: Drum major for justice, but make it all-terrain.", "keywords": ["bowl", "wonderful", "ad", "mlk", "super", "approve", "dodge", "trash", "words", "speech", "yes", "kings", "ram", "estate", "king", "statement"], "polarity": 0.27212695740473525, "subjectivity": 0.5440583079471968},

But it\u2019s not just the use of King\u2019s words to sell trucks that got it wrong\u2014it\u2019s what the rest of that exact sermon said about car buying, and capitalism itself.\n\nThese parts of his legacy get overlooked today\u2014often intentionally\u2014but in addition to civil rights, King staunchly confronted the dual threats of the excesses of capitalism and militarism.\n\nThe words in the Ram ad are from a sermon King gave at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta on Feb. 4, 1968. Entitled \u201cThe Drum Major Instinct,\u201d it was broadly about the concepts of humility and modesty, about the toxic human drive to always be in front, to always be the star, to be the drum major in the marching band of life:\n\nNow the presence of the drum major instinct is why so many people are \u201cjoiners.\u201d You know, there are some people who just join everything. And it\u2019s really a quest for attention and recognition and importance. And they get names that give them that impression. So you get your groups, and they become the \u201cGrand Patron,\u201d and the little fellow who is henpecked at home needs a chance to be the \u201cMost Worthy of the Most Worthy\u201d of something. It is the drum major impulse and longing that runs the gamut of human life. And so we see it everywhere, this quest for recognition. And we join things, overjoin really, that we think that we will find that recognition in.\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe drum major instinct isn\u2019t just limited to the idea of joining groups, however. It\u2019s also tied to the drive of mass consumption. To get the newer and shinier thing, to get the bigger and better thing. Too often, to get the latest and greatest car, and the very people who advertise cars know you have this instinct, and they prey upon it:\n\nNow the presence of this instinct explains why we are so often taken by advertisers. You know, those gentlemen of massive verbal persuasion. And they have a way of saying things to you that kind of gets you into buying. In order to be a man of distinction, you must drink this whiskey. In order to make your neighbors envious, you must drive this type of car. (Make it plain) In order to be lovely to love you must wear this kind of lipstick or this kind of perfume. And you know, before you know it, you\u2019re just buying that stuff. (Yes) That\u2019s the way the advertisers do it.\ufeff\n\nIt may seem a little on-the-nose, but King was warning against the very specific thing that Ram is doing now. And more than that,\n\nBut very seriously, it goes through life; the drum major instinct is real. (Yes) And you know what else it causes to happen? It often causes us to live above our means. (Make it plain) It\u2019s nothing but the drum major instinct. Do you ever see people buy cars that they can\u2019t even begin to buy in terms of their income? (Amen) [laughter] You\u2019ve seen people riding around in Cadillacs and Chryslers who don\u2019t earn enough to have a good T-Model Ford. (Make it plain) But it feeds a repressed ego. You know, economists tell us that your automobile should not cost more than half of your annual income. So if you make an income of five thousand dollars, your car shouldn\u2019t cost more than about twenty-five hundred. That\u2019s just good economics. And if it\u2019s a family of two, and both members of the family make ten thousand dollars, they would have to make out with one car. That would be good economics, although it\u2019s often inconvenient. But so often, haven\u2019t you seen people making five thousand dollars a year and driving a car that costs six thousand? And they wonder why their ends never meet. [laughter] That\u2019s a fact. Now the economists also say that your house shouldn\u2019t cost\u2014if you\u2019re buying a house, it shouldn\u2019t cost more than twice your income. That\u2019s based on the economy and how you would make ends meet. So, if you have an income of five thousand dollars, it\u2019s kind of difficult in this society. But say it\u2019s a family with an income of ten thousand dollars, the house shouldn\u2019t cost much more than twenty thousand. Well, I\u2019ve seen folk making ten thousand dollars, living in a forty- and fifty-thousand-dollar house. And you know they just barely make it. They get a check every month somewhere, and they owe all of that out before it comes in. Never have anything to put away for rainy days. But now the problem is, it is the drum major instinct. And you know, you see people over and over again with the drum major instinct taking them over. And they just live their lives trying to outdo the Joneses. (Amen) They got to get this coat because this particular coat is a little better and a little better-looking than Mary\u2019s coat. And I got to drive this car because it\u2019s something about this car that makes my car a little better than my neighbor\u2019s car. (Amen) I know a man who used to live in a thirty-five-thousand-dollar house. And other people started building thirty-five-thousand-dollar houses, so he built a seventy-five-thousand-dollar house. And then somebody else built a seventy-five-thousand-dollar house, and he built a hundred-thousand-dollar house. And I don\u2019t know where he\u2019s going to end up if he\u2019s going to live his life trying to keep up with the Joneses.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmphasis mine up there.\n\nKing\u2019s point was that people shouldn\u2019t be looking to the newest, best car for fulfillment. It\u2019s okay to have the car you have, to enjoy the car you have. It\u2019s okay to have the life you have. What\u2019s important is what you do with it, and how you help others. Materialistic pride divides humanity, makes you think you\u2019re better than your neighbor. We shouldn\u2019t be worried about having the latest and greatest pickup truck. Pride, greed, and the merchants that sell them are the things that ruin us.\n\nAnd to top it off, later on in the speech, King reminded us where we stand as a country:\n\nWe\u2019ve committed more war crimes almost than any nation in the world, and I\u2019m going to continue to say it. And we won\u2019t stop it because of our pride and our arrogance as a nation.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow so many have missed King\u2019s legacy is tragic, and it\u2019s something more should learn about.\n\nBut, here we are, talking about it now.

The ADL quoted a man named Jordan Jereb, who runs the small group, which is based in Tallahassee.\n\n\n\n\u201c \u2018Jereb added that ROF had not ordered or wanted Cruz to do anything like the school shooting,\u2019 the ADL wrote in a blog post that was quickly picked up by ABC News and The Associated Press, and later percolated through dozens of other media outlets. Even The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, picked up the claim\n\n\u201cSome outlets reported they had their own conversations with Jereb or classmates of Cruz who allegedly corroborated the association of Cruz with ROF.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut a few hours later, after law enforcement agencies said they had no evidence linking Cruz to ROF, Jereb said his identification of Cruz was a \u2018misunderstanding\u2019 and that he, too, had been the subject of a \u2018prank.\u2019 On online forums and Twitter, trolls and white nationalists gloated at the disinformation they had sowed.\n\n\u201c \u2018All of our evidence seems to point to the ADL getting this wrong,\u2019 said Joan Donovan, a researcher who tracks online misinformation campaigns for Data & Society, a think tank in New York City.\n\n\u201cThe ADL subsequently revised its report, as did many news outlets. . . .\u201d\n\nAssociated Press: White nationalist leader walks back comments that shooting suspect was group member\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJarvis DeBerry, NOLA.com | Times-Picayune: The numbing effect of multiple school shootings\n\nEditorial, Daily News, New York: Trump shoots blanks: He offers condolences but empty platitudes in the wake of South Florida\u2019s school massacre\n\nEditorial, Miami Herald: Yes, \u2018it\u2019 happened here.

Black Panther, who finds himself in a battle against an army led by the man who killed his father. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDaniels quoted Holland, \u201c \u2018One of the things that I have learned throughout this process is that the world has such rich stories that haven\u2019t been told yet,\u2019 he said. \u2018One of the things that writing these books does for me is it reminds me when I go to work every day that what we do as journalists is that we tell stories. We bring the hidden to light.\n\n\u201cJust like the \u2018Black Panther\u2019 movie and this novel does, they\u2019re bringing the character to light that some people knew about, and some people appreciated, but now through this novel and the movie, the entire world gets to know about it.\u2019\n\n\u201c \u2018. . . So, it just reminds me of how important our jobs are and how lucky we are as journalists to be able to do it.\u2019 \u201c\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTom DiChristopher reported Friday for cnbc.com, \u201cBoxoffice.com is currently forecasting the movie will haul in $190 million to $215 million over the long weekend. The website projects it will earn $178 million over three days.\n\n\u201cThat would be enough to put it in the upper range of the top 10 highest grossing openings for a superhero movie. At that level, Black Panther would top heavyweights such as Batman, Superman and Spider-Man and take aim at the best-ever debut for a superhero movie focused on a solo character.\n\n\u201cStrong reviews, outstanding pre-sales and a holiday weekend release underpin the bullish forecast, but it might be the revolutionary nature of the film that pushes it beyond consensus estimates, said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at boxoffice.com. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGene Demby, NPR \u201cCode Switch\u201d: Can Marvel\u2019s New Superhero Bear The Weight Of Representation?\n\nJohn Eligon; Kwame Opam; Carvell Wallace; Crystal Martin; Walter Thompson-Hernandez; Mekado Murphy; Manohla Dargis and A.O.

Woodson came up with the idea of Negro History Week in 1926. He chose the week that included the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln, Feb. 12, and Frederick Douglass, Feb. 14.\n\n\u201cInitially, only North Carolina, Delaware, West Virginia, Baltimore, Md., and Washington, D.C., signed on to the idea \u2014 and only for their black schools, which is exactly what Woodson wanted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSegregation, by law or tradition, was prevalent in the 1920s. Woodson never envisioned white students learning black history. His concern was that black students, deprived of a thorough education about their ancestors, would grow up accepting the yoke of inferiority that white people insisted they wear. . . .\u201d\n\nJackson also wrote, \u201cNegro History Week was ours alone, but Black History Month became something else. Inspired by the black power movement, black students at Kent State University organized the first Black History Month in 1970. The idea caught on and in 1976 President Gerald Ford included Black History Month as part of the nation\u2019s bicentennial celebration.\n\n\u201cWith segregation gone, more schools reserved time each February to study the contributions of prominent African Americans in history \u2014 from Denmark Vesey to Thurgood Marshall to Barack Obama. But unfortunately, learning names, dates, and events was typically as far as their studies went. Too often the necessary attention to context and relevancy was missing from the lessons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat lack of historical context was evident in the results of a study released in January by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which showed only 8 percent of high school seniors knew slavery was the main cause of the Civil War. Two-thirds didn\u2019t know it took a constitutional amendment to end slavery. That\u2019s a sorry testament to how history is being taught in America\u2019s schools.\n\n\u201cInstead of going beyond Woodson\u2019s original idea to focus on the positive contributions of individual African Americans, too many schools use Black History Month as a vehicle to teach a catalog of events and people without making tangible connections to the status of black Americans today.\n\n\u201cOne result is white Americans who don\u2019t believe slavery has anything to do with today\u2019s United States. Neither their regular history classes nor any additional study they may have done during Black History Month helped them connect the dots among slavery, segregation, and the poverty found in too many black communities today. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid W.

Sanitation Department. They left their families for a long day of collecting garbage with the full expectation of returning home to them. Instead, as their shifts were about to end and heavy rain poured down around them, the two men were crushed to death in the barrel of a faulty garbage truck.\n\nTheir deaths sparked a revolution that would forever change the trajectory of the civil rights movement. But that day, they were just two men, working through the indignity of starvation wages and torturous working conditions to support their families.\n\nThe truck in which Walker and Cole were killed was one of the six remaining antiquated garbage trucks that were in the process of being phased out of the Sanitation Department\u2019s fleet. The two men were seeking shelter from the rain by standing in the barrel of the truck, where the garbage is pushed to the rear, as the driver and two co-workers rode in the front.\n\n\n\nThen the unimaginable happened.\n\nAt around 4:20 p.m., as the men finished their shift in the predominantly white neighborhood of East Memphis, on the way back to the city dump, somehow the garbage-compression piston on the outdated, faulty truck was triggered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe motor started racing and the driver stopped and ran around and smashed that button to stop that thing,\u201d co-worker Elester Gregory, who was riding in the truck\u2019s cab, told the Commercial Appeal the next day. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was happening.

The portraits, by Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald respectively\u2014both black painters\u2014are such sharp departures from any previous depictions of a president and first lady that reviews were understandably mixed, even amongst our own crew here at The Root (including yours truly).\n\n\n\nEspecially when considering Mrs. Obama\u2019s portrait, it took a moment to reconcile her portrayal with our expectations. Where was the warmth we\u2019d become so accustomed to during the Obama era? The radiant smile? The glorious brown skin?\n\nWhile Wiley\u2019s portrait of our 44th President\u2019s portrait seemed lush and even playful\u2014if whimsically unconventional for a leader of the free world\u2014Sherald\u2019s portrait of his wife, posed similarly to Rodin\u2019s The Thinker, seemed to almost recede by comparison, like a cherished photograph that had already faded much too soon for our comfort. To some of us, it seemed more like a suggestion of our favorite first lady, rather than a portrait of the lady herself.\n\nAnd yet, in the days since\u2014for this writer, at least\u2014it has been difficult not to return to look at it again and again.\n\nAs Doreen St. Felix wrote in a wonderful analysis for the New Yorker:\n\nThe racializing schema of Sherald\u2019s work is to \u2018exclude the idea of color as race,\u2019 she has said, in her artist\u2019s statement. To Sherald, the photorealistic depiction of race\u2014a quality determined by others\u2019 eyes, externally\u2014is a dead end. Applied to Michelle Obama, the lack of brown in the skin feels first like a loss, and then like a real gain. This is a different Michelle, a woman evacuated of celebrity, who appears provisionally dreamlike, nearly a shadow. The mouth and the eyes and the strong arms that we know are present, but fainter. From some distance, I can imagine, the figure might not be immediately recognizable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf the many things that have been written about Mrs. Obama\u2019s portrait since its unveiling last Monday, several articles have focused on the dress she chose to be immortalized in, made by American (semi)affordable luxury label Milly, designed by Michelle Smith. Indeed, it is the most visually striking element of the portrait, featuring graphic-patterned patches in black, red, yellow, pink and beige, scattered across the white foreground of the skirt. It drapes across Mrs. Obama\u2019s lap in much the same way I remember quilts draping across my Mississippian great-grandmother\u2019s lap decades ago.\n\nMany have been quick to make the same comparison, especially noting similarities between Mrs. Obama\u2019s dress and the famously graphic geometric quilts created for over a century in Gee\u2019s Bend, Alabama. At the unveiling, artist Amy Sherald spoke to the similarities herself, saying:\n\nThe dress chosen for this painting was designed by Milly. It has an abstract pattern that reminded me of the Dutch artist Piet Mondrian\u2019s geometric paintings. But Milly\u2019s design also resembles the inspired quilt masterpieces made by the women of Gee\u2019s Bend, a small remote black community in Alabama where they compose quilts in geometries that transform clothes and fabric remnants into masterpieces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut designer Smith apparently had no such correlation in mind when she created the print. She spoke to Vogue about the dress, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s made of a stretch cotton poplin print in a clean, minimal, geometric print without a reference to anything past or nostalgic, which gives the dress a very forward-thinking sensibility\u2014this is very Michelle Obama.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut while Michelle Smith may not have read a metaphor for quilting in her own work, is it safe for her to assume that a woman as aware and astute as Michelle Obama\u2014well known for her strategic sartorial statements\u2014didn\u2019t? Aside from evoking the great American southern tradition of quilting\u2014as well as the stars and stripes famously handsewn for this country\u2014is it so outlandish to consider that her gown might also evoke the racial patchwork that comprises the country her husband so recently led?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo glean more insight, The Glow Up spoke with textile artist, clothing designer, children\u2019s book author and illustrator, and master quilter Cozbi Cabrera, a 2017 Lincoln Center artist-in-residence whose own quilts have been shown in the Myrtle Beach Art Museum, concurrent with an exhibit on the quilters of Gee\u2019s Bend. Like many others, she isn\u2019t so quick to discredit the correlation between the white American designer dress and the black American South.\n\nWell, I think for starters that designers have to be aware that they are influenced greatly, and that fashion overall is derivative. So, whether we are doing it consciously or subconsciously, there is something about putting all of these elements together that\u2019s going to strike a chord or trigger a memory or something. So, I think that she\u2019s probably not being\u2014I wouldn\u2019t even use the word \u2018truthful\u2019\u2014I think that she\u2019s probably not being aware of this idea that fashion is derivative. So, it comes from somewhere. And I think that rightfully so, [Amy Sherald\u2019s] notion of her choice is very telling as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCabrera is also quick to note the very \u201cAmerican story\u201d of Gee\u2019s Bend, an isolated peninsula about 35 miles southwest of Selma, Alabama, with a population of less than 300, according to the 2010 Census. Primarily African-American and reachable almost exclusively by ferry, in 1965, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. visited the enclave three weeks before Selma\u2019s \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d to encourage voter registration. However, three years before, Alabama\u2019s government had shut down ferry service to nearby Camden, further isolating the community from basic necessities like medical attention, employment, and participation in the democratic process.\n\nAnd yet, even in isolation, their traditions continued. In 2002, the Whitney Museum in New York mounted a show of the quilts of Gee\u2019s Bend, to rave reviews. The New York Times\u2019 art critic called them \u201ceye-poppingly gorgeous,\u201d while others marveled at the fact that these modernist creations could have generated within a place seemingly cut off from inspiration, as Cabrera notes:\n\n[T]heir quilts showed up at the Whitney Museum in New York, and the reviews came back that what they were doing rivaled anything that you\u2019d find in 20th-century art. ... how could it be? How could they have these sophisticated influences if they were in isolation? And it\u2019s almost like an assumption that the creator\u2014or what I would call the Divine\u2014sort of sprinkles sophistication and aesthetic instincts only on a particular group of people, in only a particular geographic location, you know?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilarly, Cabrera believes it may be short-sighted to underestimate the deep significance and skill in Sherald\u2019s portrait of Michelle Obama\u2014or to assume the former First Lady\u2019s intentions in choosing her for the commission. Because ultimately, isn\u2019t art\u2014like beauty\u2014in the eye of the beholder?\n\nI think that in a less masterful hand, most people have a tendency to kind of throw in the kitchen sink, and in my mind, [Sherald] made some very deliberate choices as to what to leave out and what was left was the likeness of Michelle Obama. So we got that it was her\u2014you know it was quite a bit of fluidity of line, and then these elements of patch. All that\u2019s left in my mind visually were the essentials to kind of like, tell the story. How [Milly designer Michelle Smith] might feel about that, I think it\u2019s almost not even relevant because I think that the larger community got what was being communicated. And so, I think that\u2019s why you keep hearing, again and again, this notion of [the] quilt. I think that there\u2019s a language that we all understand, and that\u2019s what you get with people groups; like the things that don\u2019t have to be spoken but are understood. ... It\u2019s not uncanny that the community is saying similar things along a similar vein, because we do have this common understanding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those of us whom, at first glance, might have wanted something more colorful and dramatic from our first black First Lady, perhaps it\u2019s worth taking a beat, and considering who Michelle Obama really is, as Cabrera\u2019s deft analysis reminds us:\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s the visual equivalent of a stage whisper, which draws more attention to itself.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["portrait", "dress", "black", "included", "bend", "picture", "gees", "quilts", "michelle", "lady", "obama", "think"], "polarity": 0.147996758631087, "subjectivity": 0.42747813960500525},

She\u2019s trying in that way your sister-in-law from Minnesota tried to make cornbread last Thanksgiving. She\u2019s trying in the way your high school teacher thought it would be cool to rap about fractions after he saw Freedom Writers.\n\nIt\u2019s not Evans\u2019 fault that her campaign may just be a stalking horse for white Georgia Democrats who fear a black gubernatorial nominee. It\u2019s not her fault that she\u2019s up against Stacey Abrams, who is running to be the first black female governor in America, who is a former legislator, lawyer and author who\u2019s been praised on Samantha Bee\u2019s Full Frontal and in Cosmopolitan and Glamour magazines.\n\nNope, Stacey Evans has every right to run her unseasoned campaign to the best of her ability. What she does NOT have the right to do is violate the black church during Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s holiday by putting herself in MLK blackface, then blaming her black opponent. In Georgia, we\u2019ve officially moved from the \u201cBless your heart\u201d stage to \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d\n\nOn the Sunday before Martin Luther King Jr. Day, candidate Stacey Evans attended King\u2019s historic Ebenezer Baptist Church and filmed a campaign commercial that was posted on the campaign Instagram.\n\nThis is arguably the most tone-deaf and racially offensive commercial since Kendall Jenner solved racism with a Pepsi. The commercial has been roundly dragged, not just for being racially offensive but also for demonstrating the worst kind of Democratic white-progressive virtue signaling. Do white Democrats still think you can show up at black events, shake a few hands, clap out of rhythm and wrap up the black vote? You\u2019re running against Stacey Abrams, not Roy Moore; you have to step your game up, Mrs. Evans. Heck, Ben Carson even spoke at Ebenezer that day, so clearly just showing up at church doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a first-round pick in the racial draft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven worse, the campaign filmed the service without parishioners\u2019 consent, and plenty of people were surprised to see that they\u2019d been used like props. Of course, the film quality is so bad, they might\u2019ve confused Evans\u2019 campaign team for WorldStar. However, the crusted top of this mayonnaise sandwich is the final image, where MLK is superimposed onto Evans\u2019 face like she downloaded the \u201cMLK Me\u201d app.\n\nThat\u2019s political blackface. Who doesn\u2019t know in 2018 that blackface isn\u2019t OK? Yes, the video was quickly taken down, but where are Evans\u2019 people? Because she clearly needs more of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA gaffe like this is usually indicative of a campaign that either has no black people on staff or has ones there that nobody listens to. That is not the case with the Evans campaign. The videographer, Nick Nelson, is black; her main campaign manager, Candice Franklin, is black; and she has a few black surrogates. However, when I spoke to them, none of these people seemed to have any idea how this video got made. So either Evans\u2019 Instagram has been hacked by a rogue supporter or somebody is lying.\n\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have anything to do with the video,\u201d state Rep. Dar\u2019Shun Kendrick (D-Lithonia), a known surrogate of the Evans campaign, told The Root. \u201cBut it\u2019s my understanding that the MLK image was photoshopped. I think there was some photoshopping going on.\u201d\n\nI then spoke to LaDawn Jones, former legislator and self-proclaimed \u201cstrong\u201d Evans surrogate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI found it inspiring and uplifting,\u201d she said, then eventually admitted that she could see why some found the Evans-to-MLK image \u201cupsetting.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven Jeff DiSantis, one of the top managers of the Evans campaign, wouldn\u2019t speak on the record about the video, releasing a statement instead. The key sections are below:\n\n\n\nThe Abrams campaign has decided to distort a video made by the campaign\u2019s digital company. As is usual in modern campaigns, they accompany Stacey to events so that the campaign can share our activities with the public. The digital company\u2019s camera was one of many cameras recording the service. All images and sounds come from what happened during the service, including the music and the speakers. While the Abrams campaign is trying to divide our state, the Evans campaign will continue to seek the vote of every Georgian who wants to bring hope back to Georgia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn short, none of the African-American campaign surrogates seem to know how this video was magically made, but suggest some nefarious photoshopping, and the campaign itself blames Abrams for distorting the imagery. I guess we can add computer hacker to the accusations the Evans campaign has thrown at Abrams.\n\nEvans\u2019 merry band of enablers in the press have been bending over backward to paint this commercial in the most charitable way possible. Shilling is a tough job. Greg Bluestein of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution tried to play the MLK commercial off like it was just a campaign \u201ccontroversy,\u201d conveniently neglecting to mention that it was Ebenezer Baptist Church itself that demanded the video be taken down. Lee Fang of The Intercept chimed in to lecture black people and cape for oppressed white progressives, completely and obtusely missing the point as usual (I wonder why\u2014oh wait, NOW I remember).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite candidates appropriating Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s image is not new or particularly rare. Catherine Templeton, a white Republican woman running for governor in South Carolina, is a Steve Bannon-loving, Charleston, S.C.-church-massacre-denying proud daughter of the Confederacy but had no problem superimposing her campaign logo over MLK. It\u2019s disgusting but predictable. Every white Republican and many white Democrats have done it at some point.\n\nIn fact, I don\u2019t think Evans had any ill intentions, but that\u2019s part of the problem with wannabe white \u201cprogressives.\u201d They still see African Americans as sheeple who can be bought with an afternoon of swaying and paying lip service to King\u2019s ideals. Georgia deserves better, and the black folks in Evans\u2019 campaign who enable this kind of thinking should have their cards revoked.\n\nYou can celebrate MLK any way you wish, but what you\u2019re not gon\u2019 do\u2014without significant draggage, at least\u2014is use MLK as blackface and then, when you get caught, blame black folks. Mistakes happen; take your L and keep it moving. The Evans campaign has every right to try to reach black voters with policy and speeches.

Woodson came up with the idea of Negro History Week in 1926. He chose the week that included the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln, Feb. 12, and Frederick Douglass, Feb. 14.\n\n\u201cInitially, only North Carolina, Delaware, West Virginia, Baltimore, Md., and Washington, D.C., signed on to the idea \u2014 and only for their black schools, which is exactly what Woodson wanted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSegregation, by law or tradition, was prevalent in the 1920s. Woodson never envisioned white students learning black history. His concern was that black students, deprived of a thorough education about their ancestors, would grow up accepting the yoke of inferiority that white people insisted they wear. . . .\u201d\n\nJackson also wrote, \u201cNegro History Week was ours alone, but Black History Month became something else. Inspired by the black power movement, black students at Kent State University organized the first Black History Month in 1970. The idea caught on and in 1976 President Gerald Ford included Black History Month as part of the nation\u2019s bicentennial celebration.\n\n\u201cWith segregation gone, more schools reserved time each February to study the contributions of prominent African Americans in history \u2014 from Denmark Vesey to Thurgood Marshall to Barack Obama. But unfortunately, learning names, dates, and events was typically as far as their studies went. Too often the necessary attention to context and relevancy was missing from the lessons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat lack of historical context was evident in the results of a study released in January by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which showed only 8 percent of high school seniors knew slavery was the main cause of the Civil War. Two-thirds didn\u2019t know it took a constitutional amendment to end slavery. That\u2019s a sorry testament to how history is being taught in America\u2019s schools.\n\n\u201cInstead of going beyond Woodson\u2019s original idea to focus on the positive contributions of individual African Americans, too many schools use Black History Month as a vehicle to teach a catalog of events and people without making tangible connections to the status of black Americans today.\n\n\u201cOne result is white Americans who don\u2019t believe slavery has anything to do with today\u2019s United States. Neither their regular history classes nor any additional study they may have done during Black History Month helped them connect the dots among slavery, segregation, and the poverty found in too many black communities today. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid W.

She roared. She conquered.\n\n\n\nActress Viola Davis, who has been thrilling audiences with her passionate, deeply felt words since at least 2017 (or that year she made us all cry at the Oscars), gave no less at the Women\u2019s March 2018 in Los Angeles this past Saturday.\n\nDecked out in a leather jacket; big, beautiful hair; and the fierceness of a life lived (and don\u2019t @ me for talking about how she looked\u2014at 52, she looks too damn good!), Davis gave thousands of pink-pussy-hat wearers something to talk\u2014and think\u2014about.\n\nDavis opened by saying, \u201cIn the words of my fellow American Malcolm X, I\u2019m gonna make it plain.\u201d\n\nOK, Viola. We are listening. Because opening with Malcolm means it\u2019s about to go down.\n\nShe followed up by calling the United States the greatest nation on earth, but reminding us: \u201cIn 1877, America put laws in place called the Jim Crow laws,\u201d and those laws \u201crestricted the rights of quadroons, octoroons, blacks, Hispanics, Malays ... they restricted medical, relationships, education, in all, \u201cthey restricted life.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavis also quoted Martin Luther King Jr., and then she got animated, telling the crowd that the price of freedom is certainly not free.\n\n\u201cWe only move forward when it doesn\u2019t cost us anything,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m here today saying that no one and nothing can be great unless it costs you something.\u201d\n\nShe noted that women of color, if they are raped or sexually assaulted before the age of 18, are 66 percent more likely to be raped or sexually assaulted again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSeventy percent of girls who are sexually trafficked are girls of color,\u201d Davis added. \u201cThey are coming out of the foster care system, they are coming out of poverty. It is a billion-dollar business.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe, like Oprah, called the names of activist and organizer Fannie Lou Hamer; of Recy Taylor, who was gang-raped by six white men; of Rosa Parks; of activist Tarana Burke\u2014saying their work, their sacrifice, cost them something.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNothing and no one can be great without a cost,\u201d she said.\n\nDavis closed by getting personal and saying that her testimony was that of one of those young girls of color who grew up in poverty and who was sexually violated:\n\nI am always introduced as an award-winning actor. But my testimony is one of poverty. My testimony is one of being sexually assaulted and very much seeing a childhood that was robbed from me. And I know that every single day, when I think of that, I know that the trauma of those events are still with me today. And that\u2019s what drives me to the voting booth. That\u2019s what allows me to listen to the women who are still in silence. That\u2019s what allows me to even be a citizen on this planet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then, hammering the point home, she said ain\u2019t nobody free till we all free.\n\n\u201cAs we live on earth, we\u2019ve got to bring everyone with us,\u201d said Davis.\n\nBrava, Ms. Davis.

She was describing Bennett\u2019s participation in a documentary about the story of black people in Chicago, where he lived for 35 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHis 1963 seminal work, Before the MayFlower, traces Black history from its origins in Western Africa through the trans-Atlantic sojourn that would be slavery, the Reconstruction, and the upheavals of the Civil Rights Movement,\u201d Pearson-McNeil continued. A 2008 exhibit about Bennett at Chicago\u2019s DuSable Museum of African American History called him \u201cthe people\u2019s historian.\u201d\n\nJoy Bennett noted the significance of the timing of her father\u2019s passing. \u201cDad would die on Valentine\u2019s Day in the heart of Black History Month. He even went out as a historian,\u201d she said by telephone.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack History Month began as Negro History Week, commemorating Abraham Lincoln\u2019s birthday, Feb. 12, and Feb. 14, which Frederick Douglass celebrated as his day of birth.\n\nOne of Bennett\u2019s most controversial books cast Lincoln in less than a glowing light.\n\n\u201cThe real Lincoln, the author says, was a conservative politician who said repeatedly that he believed in White supremacy,\u201d according to the dust jacket of \u201cForced Into Glory: Abraham Lincoln\u2019s White Dream,\u201d published in 2000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNot only that: He opposed the basic principle of the Emancipation Proclamation until his death and was literally forced \u2014 Count Adam Gurowski said he was literally whipped \u2014into the glory of having issued the Emancipation Proclamation,\u201d which Lincoln drafted in such a way that it did not in and of itself free a single slave.\u201d\n\n\u201cForced into Glory\u201d won the 2002 American Book Award.\n\nBennett also co-wrote 1989's \u201cSucceeding Against the Odds: The Inspiring Autobiography of One of America\u2019s Wealthiest Entrepreneurs,\u201d the story of John H. Johnson, co-founder of Johnson Publishing Co., publishers of Ebony and Jet magazines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe helped create the foundations of this [African American] struggle in the forties and fifties when the ground was hard and there were few laborers,\u201d Johnson wrote in the book. \u201c. . . we anticipated the changes and gave focus and form to them. In 1959, for example, I detected a growing interest in Black history and authorized a pathfinding Black history series. The response was so enthusiastic that we published a book, Lerone Bennett\u2019s Before the Mayflower, which became one of the most widely read Black History books ever. This marked the beginning of the Johnson Publishing Company Book Division. . . .\u201d\n\nDespite Bennett\u2019s passion for writing history for the average person, he wanted journalists to be generalists. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed that you write history one day and you write entertainment the next,\u201d he said in \u201cWriting for a Black Publication,\u201d (video) a 2010 interview with the Visionary Project.\n\nThus, his Ebony would feature such purported people-pleasers as \u201cIs It True What They Say About Twins?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBennett\u2019s association with Ebony, which he helped make the nation\u2019s leading African American publication, ended in 2009 when the publication forced his daughter Joy from the editorial staff. Her father demanded that his name be removed from the masthead, where Bennett was listed as executive editor emeritus. The magazine complied, adding that \u201chis wise counsel will always be appreciated.\u201d\n\nBennett was born in Clarksdale, Miss., and grew up in Jackson. One of his proudest moments came in 2007, when he was honored by the Mississippi State Senate. He said he never thought he\u2019d live long enough to see a black man so welcome in the state Capitol.\n\n\u201c \u2018I\u2019m 78 years old. I thought I would die before I saw this,\u2019 Bennett said. \u2018Thank you for making it possible for me to see the great dream that could be realized in this state,\u2019 \u201c Holbrook Mohr reported then for the Associated Press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a 2002 profile by the HistoryMakers, \u201cBennett attended Morehouse College, earning a B.A. in 1949. He has always considered Morehouse as the center of his academic development. After graduating, Bennett formally entered the world of journalism as a reporter for the now defunct Atlanta Daily World. He became the city editor for the magazine and worked there until 1953, when he began his work as an associate editor at Jet magazine in Chicago, Illinois. In 1954, Bennett became an associate editor at Ebony and he was promoted to senior editor of the magazine in 1958. Since then, his comprehensive articles have become one of the magazine\u2019s literary hallmarks.\u201d He retired in 2005.\n\nAt Morehouse, Bennett was a classmate of Martin Luther King Jr., Mohr wrote.\n\nMohr\u2019s story also said, \u201cIn 2006 he was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the National Association of Black Journalists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn February, Bennett\u2019s footprints and those of 12 others were added to the International Civil Rights Walk of Fame near the Atlanta church where King preached. The walk, established in 2004, now includes 50 pairs of footprints, marked in granite, from people who organizers call the \u2018foot-soldiers\u2019 of the civil rights movement.\n\n\u201cFormer President Bill Clinton appointed Bennett to the President\u2019s Committee on the Arts and Humanities. President George W. Bush appointed him to the Presidential Commission to study the proposed National Museum of African-American History and Culture, according to the Senate resolution passed in his honor.\u201d He was too ill to attend the museum\u2019s 2016 opening, Joy Bennett said, but he watched it on television.\n\n\u201cThough Bennett was born in Clarksdale, he moved with his family to Jackson at an early age where he was greatly influenced by teachers at Lanier High School,\u201d the story continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018I\u2019m indebted first to the black teachers of Mississippi, who literally saved my life,\u2019 he said. \u2018The great black school teachers in Clarksdale and Jackson told me I could dream and do anything.\u2019 \u201c\n\nBennett is survived by three daughters, Courtney and Constance Bennett of San Diego, Calif., and Alma Joy of Chicago. Their brother, Lerone Bennett III, died in 2013; their mother, former Johnson Publishing Co. journalist Gloria Sylvester, in 2009. He also leaves three granddaughters. Arrangements are being handled by the A.A.

On Tuesday, three more organizations \u2014 Citizens Bank, the Massachusetts State Lottery, and the Massachusetts Health Connector \u2014 cut ties with WEEI.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor those keeping score at home, that means at least five advertisers \u2014 including Comcast Corp. and City of Boston Credit Union \u2014 have either terminated or suspended commercial buys on the popular sports talk station.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEntercom, WEEI\u2019s owner and one of the biggest radio companies in the country, is condoning a culture of hate and acceptance of the unacceptable.\n\n\u201cThe reason some advertisers are taking their money elsewhere is simple. It\u2019s hard to defend WEEI\u2019s offensive commentary. . . .\u201d\n\nLeung also wrote, \u201cMidday cohost Christian Fauria set off the current wave of advertiser blowback when he imitated sports agent Don Yee using a stereotypical Asian accent. Yee, who is of Chinese descent and was born in the United States, speaks English without an accent; he represents Brady and San Francisco 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOn Friday, WEEI suspended Fauria for five days, characterizing his behavior as an \u2018insensitive and ill-conceived attempt at humor.\u2019\n\n\u201cHis reprimand came two weeks after the suspension of another WEEI personality, Alex Reimer. The fill-in host was suspended indefinitely after using a derogatory phrase to describe Brady\u2019s daughter.\n\n\u201cFor too long, WEEI drove ratings by spewing hate and vitriol disguised as sports talk.

But in the short term, the Trump-backed immigration proposal, combined with other recent moves by the administration and its allies \u2014 support for voter suppression, gerrymandering and various other schemes to disenfranchise minority voters \u2014 could extend the white hegemony that brought Trump to power and sustains Republicans.\n\n\u201cFor ages, Republicans said that their beef was with illegal immigrants and that legal immigrants should be embraced and welcomed. No longer. In the immigration fight on the Hill, there is broad bipartisan consensus to legalize the \u2018dreamers\u2019 \u2014 illegal immigrants brought here as children \u2014 and to fortify border security. The dispute is really about the Trump proposal to rein in legal immigration by undoing the family-based approach, in which immigrants petition to bring over immediate family, that has always been at the heart of U.S. immigration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThough details aren\u2019t yet known, estimates are that the legislation would cut legal immigration, currently 1.1 million per year, by 300,000 to 500,000 annually. A previous version of the \u2018chain migration\u2019 proposal by Sens.

Williams herself has long reported on R. Kelly\u2019s misdeeds throughout the years and has never shied away from expressing her disdain of the singer, so one would assume she would align with such a crusade.\n\nHowever, when the campaign was discussed during her Hot Topics segment, Williams was rather dismissive. \u201cWhat is this, 10 years too late?\u201d Williams told the audience. \u201cIt\u2019s not gonna work.

Another writes, \u201cWait are we gonna forget that he pissed on a underaged girl? Wait what??\u201d\n\nOn the final date of their sold out arena tour, Xscape brought R. Kelly out on stage. Several members have daughters, and on a recent episode of The Real Housewives of Atlanta, Kandi Burruss took part in an anti-domestic violence PSA organized by her co-star Kenya Moore. Why shoot that and then allow this shit to happen?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s talk about Jhen\u00e9 Aiko while we\u2019re at it. She has a duet with R. Kelly (2015's \u201cLet\u2019s Make Some Noise\u201d) and appears alongside Kelly on a recent Chris Brown track called \u201cJuicy Booty.\u201d I think of tranquility and good weed when I think of her, not complicity.\n\nLast year, I wrote about how sexism and racism within the music industry might compel some black female singers to join an R. Kelly tour bill. It remains a pity that a man like R. Kelly can continue to enjoy sizable support despite decades of being accused of sexual predatory behavior while talented women with less tawdry histories have to defer to and depend on him for visibility and money.\n\nThat was never an excuse for anyone who makes such a choice, but Lil\u2019 Kim and Xscape are far less vulnerable than those singers. Xscape had an all-female bill and sold out arenas across the country despite not having released an album in nearly 20 years. They made a willful choice to put that man on stage. It was the wrong one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same goes for Lil\u2019 Kim. She is not far removed from the well-received Bad Boy Reunion Tour; has the likes of Beyonc\u00e9 dressing up as her for Halloween; has Remy Ma sampling her old hits to get radio airplay in this decade; and continues to enjoy a dedicated fan base that will pay to see her no matter the venue. And as a legend widely revered by artists of all genres, there are many people Lil\u2019 Kim could call for studio time. So it is a pity that she hasn\u2019t blocked R. Kelly\u2019s number already.\n\nI\u2019m not surprised when the likes of Chris Brown continue to work with R. Kelly, but I am perplexed when Xscape and Lil\u2019 Kim and Jhen\u00e9 Aiko still do. I\u2019ve long questioned men who support other men accused of predatory behavior, but evidently, there are women whose choices warrant similar inquiries.\n\nI don\u2019t care how much folks enjoy 12 Play and The Chocolate Factory. In 2018, it\u2019s fuck R. Kelly forever. I don\u2019t know if we can ever truly rid ourselves of Pissy considering we exist in a celebrity-driven news market with an insatiable craving for content, but there is certainly a way to minimize R. Kelly as much as possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can stop inviting him to award shows. We can stop playing him on the radio. We can stop allowing him to be booked in big arenas; we can let his peeing ass perform in some miserable somebody\u2019s backyard or preferred circle of hell instead. We can stop allowing him space on our sold-out arena tours. We can cut those studio sessions out of the budget. We can stop doing any single thing that allows him to keep thinking he\u2019s invincible and above reproach.\n\nEveryone who cares about black women and girls, consent, and autonomy should be down for that cause. If you aren\u2019t, you are part of the problem.

The portraits, by Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald respectively\u2014both black painters\u2014are such sharp departures from any previous depictions of a president and first lady that reviews were understandably mixed, even amongst our own crew here at The Root (including yours truly).\n\n\n\nEspecially when considering Mrs. Obama\u2019s portrait, it took a moment to reconcile her portrayal with our expectations. Where was the warmth we\u2019d become so accustomed to during the Obama era? The radiant smile? The glorious brown skin?\n\nWhile Wiley\u2019s portrait of our 44th President\u2019s portrait seemed lush and even playful\u2014if whimsically unconventional for a leader of the free world\u2014Sherald\u2019s portrait of his wife, posed similarly to Rodin\u2019s The Thinker, seemed to almost recede by comparison, like a cherished photograph that had already faded much too soon for our comfort. To some of us, it seemed more like a suggestion of our favorite first lady, rather than a portrait of the lady herself.\n\nAnd yet, in the days since\u2014for this writer, at least\u2014it has been difficult not to return to look at it again and again.\n\nAs Doreen St. Felix wrote in a wonderful analysis for the New Yorker:\n\nThe racializing schema of Sherald\u2019s work is to \u2018exclude the idea of color as race,\u2019 she has said, in her artist\u2019s statement. To Sherald, the photorealistic depiction of race\u2014a quality determined by others\u2019 eyes, externally\u2014is a dead end. Applied to Michelle Obama, the lack of brown in the skin feels first like a loss, and then like a real gain. This is a different Michelle, a woman evacuated of celebrity, who appears provisionally dreamlike, nearly a shadow. The mouth and the eyes and the strong arms that we know are present, but fainter. From some distance, I can imagine, the figure might not be immediately recognizable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf the many things that have been written about Mrs. Obama\u2019s portrait since its unveiling last Monday, several articles have focused on the dress she chose to be immortalized in, made by American (semi)affordable luxury label Milly, designed by Michelle Smith. Indeed, it is the most visually striking element of the portrait, featuring graphic-patterned patches in black, red, yellow, pink and beige, scattered across the white foreground of the skirt. It drapes across Mrs. Obama\u2019s lap in much the same way I remember quilts draping across my Mississippian great-grandmother\u2019s lap decades ago.\n\nMany have been quick to make the same comparison, especially noting similarities between Mrs. Obama\u2019s dress and the famously graphic geometric quilts created for over a century in Gee\u2019s Bend, Alabama. At the unveiling, artist Amy Sherald spoke to the similarities herself, saying:\n\nThe dress chosen for this painting was designed by Milly. It has an abstract pattern that reminded me of the Dutch artist Piet Mondrian\u2019s geometric paintings. But Milly\u2019s design also resembles the inspired quilt masterpieces made by the women of Gee\u2019s Bend, a small remote black community in Alabama where they compose quilts in geometries that transform clothes and fabric remnants into masterpieces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut designer Smith apparently had no such correlation in mind when she created the print. She spoke to Vogue about the dress, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s made of a stretch cotton poplin print in a clean, minimal, geometric print without a reference to anything past or nostalgic, which gives the dress a very forward-thinking sensibility\u2014this is very Michelle Obama.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut while Michelle Smith may not have read a metaphor for quilting in her own work, is it safe for her to assume that a woman as aware and astute as Michelle Obama\u2014well known for her strategic sartorial statements\u2014didn\u2019t? Aside from evoking the great American southern tradition of quilting\u2014as well as the stars and stripes famously handsewn for this country\u2014is it so outlandish to consider that her gown might also evoke the racial patchwork that comprises the country her husband so recently led?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo glean more insight, The Glow Up spoke with textile artist, clothing designer, children\u2019s book author and illustrator, and master quilter Cozbi Cabrera, a 2017 Lincoln Center artist-in-residence whose own quilts have been shown in the Myrtle Beach Art Museum, concurrent with an exhibit on the quilters of Gee\u2019s Bend. Like many others, she isn\u2019t so quick to discredit the correlation between the white American designer dress and the black American South.\n\nWell, I think for starters that designers have to be aware that they are influenced greatly, and that fashion overall is derivative. So, whether we are doing it consciously or subconsciously, there is something about putting all of these elements together that\u2019s going to strike a chord or trigger a memory or something. So, I think that she\u2019s probably not being\u2014I wouldn\u2019t even use the word \u2018truthful\u2019\u2014I think that she\u2019s probably not being aware of this idea that fashion is derivative. So, it comes from somewhere. And I think that rightfully so, [Amy Sherald\u2019s] notion of her choice is very telling as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCabrera is also quick to note the very \u201cAmerican story\u201d of Gee\u2019s Bend, an isolated peninsula about 35 miles southwest of Selma, Alabama, with a population of less than 300, according to the 2010 Census. Primarily African-American and reachable almost exclusively by ferry, in 1965, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. visited the enclave three weeks before Selma\u2019s \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d to encourage voter registration. However, three years before, Alabama\u2019s government had shut down ferry service to nearby Camden, further isolating the community from basic necessities like medical attention, employment, and participation in the democratic process.\n\nAnd yet, even in isolation, their traditions continued. In 2002, the Whitney Museum in New York mounted a show of the quilts of Gee\u2019s Bend, to rave reviews. The New York Times\u2019 art critic called them \u201ceye-poppingly gorgeous,\u201d while others marveled at the fact that these modernist creations could have generated within a place seemingly cut off from inspiration, as Cabrera notes:\n\n[T]heir quilts showed up at the Whitney Museum in New York, and the reviews came back that what they were doing rivaled anything that you\u2019d find in 20th-century art. ... how could it be? How could they have these sophisticated influences if they were in isolation? And it\u2019s almost like an assumption that the creator\u2014or what I would call the Divine\u2014sort of sprinkles sophistication and aesthetic instincts only on a particular group of people, in only a particular geographic location, you know?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilarly, Cabrera believes it may be short-sighted to underestimate the deep significance and skill in Sherald\u2019s portrait of Michelle Obama\u2014or to assume the former First Lady\u2019s intentions in choosing her for the commission. Because ultimately, isn\u2019t art\u2014like beauty\u2014in the eye of the beholder?\n\nI think that in a less masterful hand, most people have a tendency to kind of throw in the kitchen sink, and in my mind, [Sherald] made some very deliberate choices as to what to leave out and what was left was the likeness of Michelle Obama. So we got that it was her\u2014you know it was quite a bit of fluidity of line, and then these elements of patch. All that\u2019s left in my mind visually were the essentials to kind of like, tell the story. How [Milly designer Michelle Smith] might feel about that, I think it\u2019s almost not even relevant because I think that the larger community got what was being communicated. And so, I think that\u2019s why you keep hearing, again and again, this notion of [the] quilt. I think that there\u2019s a language that we all understand, and that\u2019s what you get with people groups; like the things that don\u2019t have to be spoken but are understood. ... It\u2019s not uncanny that the community is saying similar things along a similar vein, because we do have this common understanding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those of us whom, at first glance, might have wanted something more colorful and dramatic from our first black First Lady, perhaps it\u2019s worth taking a beat, and considering who Michelle Obama really is, as Cabrera\u2019s deft analysis reminds us:\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s the visual equivalent of a stage whisper, which draws more attention to itself.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["portrait", "dress", "black", "included", "bend", "picture", "gees", "quilts", "michelle", "lady", "obama", "think"], "polarity": 0.147996758631087, "subjectivity": 0.42747813960500525},

The #MeToo founder has been rightfully getting her shine since the movement bearing the name she coined caught Hollywood\u2019s attention last fall. In the months since, she has appeared on red carpets, been honored in Time magazine, and become a regular on the talk and news show circuits.\n\nBut amid all the fanfare, the one thing Burke has never neglected is her mission to support and protect black and brown girls and women, a point she made abundantly clear when she appeared on Comedy Central\u2019s The Opposition With Jordan Klepper on Thursday\u2014her segment begins at the 15:31 mark.\n\n\u201cWe started #MeToo because it was an exchange of empathy between survivors, to let them know that they\u2019re not alone,\u201d she said.\n\nSince Klepper\u2019s show is satirical, he naturally played devil\u2019s advocate when discussing the need and motives of #MeToo, voicing the increasingly irrational concerns of men who likely feel that the movement endangers their right to sexual entitlement. When asked by Klepper about the danger of conflating sexual harassment and assault under the umbrella of a single hashtag, Burke illustrated the larger danger of ignoring the insidious nature of sexual harassment:\n\nThere\u2019s no conflation; there\u2019s actually a spectrum. And so, sexual harassment and sexual abuse and sexual violence are on a spectrum. On one end, we have sexual harassment, which creates hostile environments and make people uncomfortable and really open a gateway for more intense violence. So they can all live under the same hashtag.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe went on to point out that #MeToo\u2019s actual mission is \u201cempowerment through empathy\u201d\u2014a mission that we share here at The Glow Up. When Klepper playfully quipped that he thought empathy to be synonymous with weakness, Burke very seriously replied:\n\nEmpathy is actually the opposite of weakness; it is the power between two people. ... When one person says to another person, \u201cMe too,\u201d that person has shared something about a trauma that they experienced. The other person is empowered by that; it\u2019s the power in knowing that you\u2019re not alone, it\u2019s the power in knowing that somebody believes you, and hears you, and sees you, and is there for you.\n\nBut ever the comedian, Klepper wasn\u2019t done, ribbing Burke on why she continues to fix her social media gaze upon alleged serial sexual abuser and pedophile R. Kelly. Through Klepper\u2019s satirical lens, Kelly\u2019s only relevance should be related to his record releases. Burke coolly responded with the clapback of the night: \u201cYou know what else he hasn\u2019t released? The women that he\u2019s holding captive in houses in Atlanta and Chicago.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I tell you that I stood up and applauded and whooped with the studio audience! And as always, Burke brought the movement back to black and brown girls and their specific vulnerability\u2014and invisibility\u2014in discussions of sexual abuse.\n\n[P]eople tend to not care about things that affect the most marginalized amongst us. [Kelly\u2019s] victims, the people who he seeks out are vulnerable girls who come from vulnerable communities, and they look like me, mostly. ... [N]ow\u2014largely because of this movement\u2014we are bringing more attention to people like R. Kelly and hoping that we can take him down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll in all, in our current era of catchphrases, memes and passing trends, Burke\u2019s appearance on The Opposition was a cogent reminder that our collective work must continue, even\u2014no, especially\u2014amid all the well-deserved attention.

Years before her success as a television host, she dominated New York City radio as a shock jock obsessed with celebrity gossip and provocative chitchat.\n\nShe spat vitriol that scathed her targets and caused many of them to retaliate, most notably Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs back in 1998, after she spread rumors that he was gay. The hip-hop mogul flexed his influence so hard, Williams was blackballed in her industry, bringing her career to a full stop for a number of years. But it was as clear then as it is today that she gives zero fucks about what rolls off her tongue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of this #MeToo movement,\u201d she said during her show\u2019s \u201cHot Topics\u201d segment. \u201cI love that people are speaking up for the first time and coming out and everything, but now it\u2019s got\u2014I look at all men like, \u2018You\u2019re a #MeToo.\u2019 All of them. All of them, which is not fair.\u201d\n\nAnd in response to the recent #MuteRKelly campaign, Williams had this to say: \u201cWhat is this, 10 years too late? It\u2019s not going to work. Black people aren\u2019t really good at protesting. Not since the King march ... R. Kelly wasn\u2019t a \u2018me too.\u2019 Aaliyah voluntarily married him when she was 15 years old. Her parents voluntarily let her do it.\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019 recent comments in response to the #MeToo and #MuteRKelly campaigns are, in my opinion, her most vile and disgusting to date. Not only did she de-emphasize the activists\u2019 initiative to aggressively protest at R. Kelly performances (at whatever point in time), but she argued on the crooner\u2019s behalf. Williams basically absolved Kelly, co-signed his statutory conduct and lambasted the young women who were linked to him.\n\n\n\nHer level of victim-blaming is both disturbing and reckless. Williams chided late songstress Aaliyah\u2014and, inaccurately, her parents\u2014for consenting to marriage with the R&B pervert. She also claimed that the teen girls who are currently part of Kelly\u2019s harem are willing participants\u2014and faulted their parents for that, too. And perhaps worst of all, the host also told her viewers that the 13-year-old girl allegedly featured in Kelly\u2019s sex tape\u2014whom he purportedly urinated on\u2014\u201cwas down with it.\u201d All because Williams is \u201csick of the #MeToo movement.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrankly, I am sick of Wendy Williams.\n\nWilliams\u2019 statements and defense of R. Kelly are a slap in the face to female survivors of sexual abuse, vulnerable girls and the movements that advocate for them. She is one of many black women whose thinking is so patriarchal, they engage in a brand of misogynoir that is not only foul AF, but downright dangerous.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s internalized racism and internalized misogyny,\u201d Stacey Patton told The Glow Up. Patton is assistant professor of multimedia journalism at Morgan State University and the author of Spare the Kids: Why Whupping Children Won\u2019t Save Black America. She said:\n\nThere\u2019s a long tradition of this, deeply tied to the history of slavery and racism. One of the core features of the racialization of black bodies is to create this narrative that they\u2019re sexual deviants. Black [women] have participated in that discourse, softly believing that if they adhere to rules about what it means to be a virtuous woman, that somehow it makes us more acceptable to society. So we can\u2019t, even in our imagination, believe young black girls can be victimized in this way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams\u2019 narrative reeks of toxic femininity. In many black communities and households alike, young girls are emotionally victimized\u2014largely by women, long before they encounter men. They are unfairly sexualized according to their attitudes, bodies and mannerisms. Some of us may be familiar with the term \u201cacting womanish\u201d being directed at black girls. For those who are not, Dorothy Randall Tsuruta made it plain in her article for the Western Journal of Black Studies, where she explained:\n\n[The] culturally-derived concept, womanish (\u201cmannish\u201d for boys) is rooted in the social practice of Black adults, especially Black women, setting boundaries for Black girls.\n\nThough writer Alice Walker is sympathetic in redefining the expression to embolden young girls with womanish characteristics, many women remain stuck on its original connotations. They wax old toxic philosophies onto innocent girls\u2014much as Williams does, when she faults underage girls for their engagement with Kelly\u2014knowing full well that the law and power dynamics involved clearly define them as prey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t divorce that shaming of young black girls from the [parent] shaming we see online,\u201d Patton said, speaking of the extremes some women will go to to guilt their daughters.\n\nNothing good comes from this toxic policing of our girls. It upholds the patriarchal idea that black girls are fast-ass Jezebels who are sexually mature beyond their years and need to be subdued. It denies them the opportunity to be exactly who they are\u2014young girls. This castigation chips away their confidence, diminishes their self-esteem and stunts their agency. It robs them of the tools needed to protect themselves from being exploited\u2014sexually or otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams\u2019 dismissal of black women\u2019s agency is akin to silencing them. In a broader context, it contributes to the erasure of black women\u2014as if patriarchy, white feminism and the world at-large don\u2019t already have that task covered.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this before\u2014when the FBI, white liberals and activist groups tried to suppress the female voices of #BlackLivesMatter by co-opting their agenda. More recently, we saw it when ESPN suspended Jemele Hill for \u201ca second violation of social media guidelines\u201d\u2014also known as expressing her views as a black woman about a \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d president. The attempt to quiet black women is overwhelming, and where we don\u2019t need it is in spaces or conversations among our own.\n\nThe #MuteRKelly campaign is long overdue. For over 20 years, Kelly has reportedly engaged in felonious sex with underage women and allegedly continues to do so with impunity. This is mainly because the black community has not held Kelly or other sexual miscreants like him accountable. The fact that the #MuteRKelly campaign\u2019s creators, Kenyette Barnes and Oronike Odeleye, have come through to do the extreme lifting that no one else bothered to do speaks volumes to their commitment to black woman and girls. That Williams denigrates their efforts by stating, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work,\u201d further confirms that she does not value the voices of black women or their resistance.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOdeleye considers the slight a plus, telling The Glow Up:\n\nBy bringing up the #MuteRKelly discussion on the national stage, Wendy Williams helped spread the message that there are black women nationwide standing united to end the sexual, physical and mental abuse of our young black women. . .Wherever R. Kelly is performing, we\u2019ll be there. We won\u2019t rest until we have, at the very least, ended his career. We are working with the victims, victims\u2019 families and attorneys to bring yet another criminal case against him. We plan to be a needle in his side until he\u2019s in the poor house, a mental facility or a jail cell.\n\nTarana Burke, founder of the Me Too movement, also feels that Kelly\u2019s time is up and that he should not be \u201cconveniently\u201d left out of conversations on sexual assault, especially among black women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlack women are just as vocal about giving R. Kelly a chance. I\u2019ve seen Facebook statuses that say, \u2018I don\u2019t care who [R. Kelly] is fucking, I\u2019m going to see him tonight\u2014I\u2019m buying my ticket,\u2019\u201d Burke stated in a phone interview with The Glow Up.\n\nThe Me Too movement founded by Burke in 2006 is not be confused with the latest #MeToo movement tied to the sexual harassment and rape of women in Hollywood. Although the two intersect today, initially they did not. Burke\u2019s movement was specifically started for underserved black girls from low-income communities who were sexually victimized and in need of supportive healing.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Burke responded to Williams\u2019 inflammatory comments:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSexual violence knows no race, color, class or gender, but the response to sexual violence does,\u201d Burke said in our interview. \u201cThe response to sexual violence is highly gendered and highly racialized and definitely defined by class.\u201d\n\nYeah, that part.\n\nIt is this nuance that allows R. Kelly to get off scot-free. Williams is reckless and clearly driven by her black female antagonism in not making these distinctions. That Williams (and black women of the same ilk) can afford to be so \u201csick of\u201d #MeToo is really quite disconcerting. In the same vein as Kelly, she is both a trigger and the gun, busting shots at black women, exploiting them and denying their humanity. Like R. Kelly, Wendy is out here wildin\u2019, and she, too, needs to be put on mute.", "keywords": ["williams", "assault", "metoo", "twisted", "wildin", "wendy", "black", "comes", "kelly", "girls", "muterkelly", "women", "r", "sexual", "young"], "polarity": 0.01676189520560382, "subjectivity": 0.48182343778370257},

I was a 14-year-old freshman at Loyola High School, a prestigious Jesuit all-boys school in Los Angeles built on the philosophy that rigorous academic training would produce the next generation of elite Catholic young men.\n\n\n\nKnown for its meat grinder academics, Loyola also had a complementary mission to train young men to have a social justice mindset, a \u201cMan for Others.\u201d We were to go out and change the world. Seems like a school perfectly matched to the philosophy of Martin Luther King Jr., right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, not at first.\n\nFor most of the school\u2019s life, the world that Loyola wanted to change was white, just like its student body and faculty. Around the mid-1970s, by the time the school opened its doors to more black and brown boys from throughout South Central and East L.A., it had recognized that African American and Latino communities needed to be served also. But still, when I entered Loyola, the school was around 90 percent white, both in students and faculty.\n\nFrom the point of view of the small group of black Loyola boys, we were invisible. Admitted for our academic chops, yes, but who also just happened to be damn fast on the football field and track, we were ignored in all things social. We had to fight for recognition of our clubs, to host dances with black Catholic girls\u2019 schools and to gain the rights any other student would have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the downside. The upside? We also knew that by attending Loyola, we were the direct beneficiaries of the Martin Luther King Jr. dream. As such, we wanted Loyola to recognize King\u2019s birthday, which had yet to be declared a federal holiday, as a school holiday.\n\nLoyola said no.\n\nSo we black boys did what we were supposed to do. We revolted.\n\nMost of our families migrated to Los Angeles in the 1950s and 1960s to escape the darkness of the Jim Crow South in order to bask in the golden-sunshine promise of western freedom. Now able to see the mountaintop, black families in Southern California took full advantage. Affirmative action opened previously closed doors in education and employment, turning sharecroppers who\u2019d pulled cotton in the dry, hot fields of Texas into shareholders of Texas Instruments. And they destroyed the racist housing covenants that kept blacks out of the previously white South Central neighborhoods like Inglewood, Baldwin Hills, Ladera Heights, Windsor Hills and View Park. Having their sons admitted to the top academic school like Loyola was a cherry on top.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe were living King\u2019s dream.\n\nThis didn\u2019t mean that every black Loyola boy was a natural ally. Most of us had grown up playing in Little League against one another, but there were definite class differences. Flatlanders, aka the boys who lived in South Central and Inglewood, versus the Hill Negroes, the ones with the Baldwin Hills views of downtown Los Angeles\u2014these were a definite class dividing line. It was Jack and Jill versus Jamal and Jamila. Those who took the Rapid Transit District bus, aka the Rough Tough and Dangerous, through Blood and Crip territory versus those who rode comfortably in their dad\u2019s classic Jag to the Dons.\n\nYet when it came to standing up for our own dignity, and the dignity of King, those black class barriers broke down and we stood arm in arm and marched in lockstep. We\u2019d fight together not only to get a King holiday but also to change the school itself. Not just for us, but also for future black Loyola boys.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaught by the Jesuits that our brains were our most powerful weapon, and the reason we\u2019d been admitted to the school in the first place, we pressured the Jesuits to listen to our arguments. We transformed our lunch from pickup basketball games to teach-ins around the philosophies of Frantz Fanon, Angela Davis, Dick Gregory and Malcolm X. We grew our facial hair, in direct violation of the strict Loyola dress code, as an act of nonviolent protest. This would get us JUG, or Justice Under God, as detention was known at the school, but still, the Jesuits didn\u2019t move.\n\nFinally, we decided to do something drastic. Instead of simply being absent on the day, the black students would show up on King\u2019s birthday wearing a white shirt, black pants and a simple black-tie uniform. The key? Stay silent in class when called upon by teachers as an act of nonviolent resistance. Today this may seem like a relatively benign act of defiance, since it didn\u2019t involve tearing something up or burning something down, but as a 14-year-old black boy still trying to understand that he held all the power in the universe to make change, it was amazing.\n\nLoyola is the oldest school in Southern California, with the traditions and stately brick buildings that come with that legacy. Intrinsic within Loyola was the notion that you as a student were extremely privileged to attend such an august institution, and as such, students needed to toe the line, or that opportunity could be taken away from you. In other words, when the Jesuits asked you to jump, you only asked how high after you were already in the air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo when the teacher pointed to you and said, \u201cMr. Ross \u2026 ,\u201d you answered immediately. We didn\u2019t.\n\nI didn\u2019t.\n\nOn that day on Jan. 15, 1981, the majority of the black students at Loyola (there are a few who didn\u2019t, and to this day, I can remember their names) sat in their seats and said nothing when called upon. It was an act of defiance that was unmistakable and, frankly, jarring to the Jesuits. And yet, understanding King\u2019s philosophy that said nonviolent change was revolutionary, we risked our spots at Loyola to create our own small revolution.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter school, phone calls were made to our nervous parents, the ones who\u2019d risked so much to get us into that \u201cLie-Oh-La,\u201d and yet they didn\u2019t blink, either.\n\nWe didn\u2019t win that year. But we kept up the protests, the rhetoric, and finally the Jesuits broke. Loyola honored Martin Luther King Jr. as a school holiday in 1982, a year before President Ronald Reagan signed the federal holiday into law.\n\nThat was then, 36 years ago, when King\u2019s life and philosophy felt real and alive. Now we\u2019re approaching the 50th anniversary of his death, and King has been transformed into a stone figure, towering over the African-American community, but rarely understood correctly. For my Gen X compadres, many of us moved on from King, who in some ways became pass\u00e9 in comparison with the dynamic Malcolm X, and the burgeoning hip-hop culture that embodied his \u201cBy any means necessary\u201d philosophy.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe were living in a world where the crack was flowing, the bullets flying and the government lying, all to wage war on black and brown bodies in Baltimore, Chicago, Washington, D.C., New Orleans and, yes, South Central. Nonviolence? Not a goddamn chance. But for many white folks, and some black folks, the diminished legacy of King presented an opportunity.\n\nGiven a choice between the angry red pill of Malcolm X\u2019s \u201cBallot or the Bullet\u201d and the blue chill pill of King\u2019s nonviolence, white folks began swallowing handfuls of blue pills that created a gentrified MLK of \u201cWhat would King do?\u201d questions, and \u201ccolorblind society\u201d empty platitudes. In other words, white folks turned Martin Luther King Jr. into a Jedi mind trick of nothingness, stripping him of meaning, and turning his words and movement into a clich\u00e9.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t as if they were alone. What was more genius was that they got some black folks to believe that \u201cnothingness\u201d definition of King. While we weren\u2019t looking, someone had injected a post-racial tumor into the brains of some black folks who turned a King movement dedicated to the \u201cus\u201d into a hollow narcissistic philosophy devoted to the \u201cme.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese Negropeans, instead of feeling the responsibility of fighting the King fight to create a hand-up for those needing a come up, rejected the tangible connective tissue that binds us together as black people. In other words, they\u2019d sing Stevie Wonder\u2019s \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d tribute as an ode to authentic blackness, heads swaying and all, without giving one nanosecond of understanding of the philosophy of the man for whom the song was written.\n\nI see it in social media spaces like Nextdoor and Facebook groups, especially those centered in the black Los Angeles areas of Inglewood, Baldwin Hills, Ladera, View Park and Windsor Hills, the same places where my fellow Loyola classmates and I lived and fought to keep King\u2019s dream alive. They\u2019re now filled with the nouveau Negro riche who are more concerned with their paper property values than with the plight of the black poor for whom King marched. They spend their time aggrieved that the black poor inconveniently live within shouting distance of their emerald green lawns and mighty-whitey picket fences.\n\nWith their remote cameras, their transformation of crime into a fetish, and the almost pathological need to distinguish themselves from the poor, undereducated black other who have the temerity to walk down their sidewalks, it should come as no surprise that as these black middle-class communities became more and more gentrified by the privileged children of white flight, these beneficiaries of King enthusiastically joined these new interlopers in myopically misquoting King\u2019s \u201ccolorblind society\u201d as a justification for not noticing that African-American communities are being dissolved in irrevocable ways, all because yet another zero has been added to the worth of their house and a Whole Foods is rumored to be a-comin\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs that how much King\u2019s dream is worth today?\n\nIn some ways, this is a natural progression as the struggle for social justice moves from consciousness to unconsciousness as the generations move away from the real King as a flesh-and-blood human rights revolutionary. Fifty years after his dead body was reduced to a Newsweek shock post, King has become a myth or a symbol. Nothing says your philosophy has become impotent more than when black folks think they can create social change through those symbols, but without the hard work. Most important, King as symbol has stripped away the empathy that comes with believing that the destinies of black people, whether rich or poor, are always and forever connected.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChanging one\u2019s profile picture to say Black Lives Matter one day, only to counteract it the next day by parroting the white supremacist notion that blackness is an inherent moral deficit that causes \u201cblack-on-black crime,\u201d is a paradox that can\u2019t be aligned. However, it is what happens when you get the good education, the good job, and think that you made it because of your individual genius and pluck, but also because you think your property taxes are the true metric of your moral worth. A wealth that you believe gives you carte blanche to look down on the black working poor who rent, shower at night because of their dirty jobs and, yeah, like to talk shit on street corners with a tall can, seeing them as your lessers.\n\n\u201cRaise your game up!\u201d is the pithy philosophy of some beneficiaries of King\u2019s largesse. It\u2019s what they shout to the black poor for whom King actually fought. King died supporting the Memphis garbage workers as they went on strike for a decent wage back in 1968, but if they did that today in a black middle-class neighborhood, we\u2019d have some black folks ask in social media why they had to see these dirty men walking on their sidewalks, and why couldn\u2019t they protest somewhere else?\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need any ghetto black kids being bused into our neighborhoods\u201d is what they do say today when King\u2019s mission of erasing structural educational inequity means that their Capri Sun-sipping black children would sit side by side with a black kid from the projects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words, King\u2019s dream\u2014the one that spoke of centering the inequities of black America, particularly around educational access and poverty, into America\u2019s consciousness\u2014had turned into a RushCard nightmare of petty capitalism and the struggle to be seen as upper black middle class through the accumulation of expensive but rapidly depreciating things.\n\nI imagine you already know that I am much more socialistic in my economic theory than capitalistic. And yet I am not so opposed to capitalism that I have failed to see its relative merits. It started out with a noble and high motive, to block the trade monopolies of nobles, but like most human systems it falls victim to the very thing it was revolting against. So today capitalism has outlived its usefulness. It has brought about a system that takes necessities from the masses to give luxuries to the classes.\n\nThese were the words of a young King writing to his wife, Coretta, in 1952. They were prophetic, and for King\u2019s dream to be real for the next 50 years, black folks are going to have to move beyond their Schoolhouse Rock version of this revolutionary man and recognize that many have been brainwashed into loving a King dream that only Ronald Reagan would recognize. And the sad reality is that the gentrification of our black middle-class neighborhoods was long preceded by the gentrification of our mentalities toward one another as black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose 14-year-old black boys back in 1980 were privileged to get that Loyola education, and we realized that the doors opened by King had made it possible. But we also knew that we weren\u2019t getting an education just to have good credit and brag about our newest Chinese-sweatshop-built mobile phone. The true meaning of King for the next 50 years is one that makes us care about black people, black community and blackness, not just for altruism\u2019s sake but because we love ourselves. That\u2019s when King\u2019s dream becomes relevant and real, even when we\u2019ve reached middle-class respectability.", "keywords": ["black", "blacks", "school", "words", "luther", "martin", "folks", "loyola", "jr", "kings", "philosophy", "social", "gentrifiers", "mean", "white", "king", "does", "gentrified"], "polarity": 0.050879399521374866, "subjectivity": 0.4182667207049923},

The local news was beginning to feel like trauma porn and was much too close to home.\n\nThe purge had been a healthy choice\u2014that is, until national news infiltrated my timeline, the Twitterverse and the whole-ass webosphere with film executive Harvey Weinstein\u2019s alleged history of rape and sexual assault against women he worked with. Not long after, Kevin Spacey, lead actor of Bryan Singer\u2019s The Usual Suspects, entered a band of unusual suspects\u2014grown-ass men accused of sexually preying on children. Spacey apologized to his accuser, actor Anthony Rapp, who was 14 years old at the time he says he was assaulted, for \u201cwhat would have been deeply inappropriate behavior\u201d\u2014behavior that Spacey doesn\u2019t quite recall.\n\nWhile all of this news is disturbing, none of it hits close to home like the more obscure, resurfacing news of R&B musician R. Kelly and his alleged bizarre sexual practices and undying affinity for underage black girls. Apparently, the victimization of young black girls is not newsworthy enough for the mass media or the court of public opinion to be engrossed or enraged at Weinstein levels. Both treat the sexual assault of black girls as if it were hardly news at all. To a fault, they are right. The predatory sexualization of young black girls is so ubiquitous, it is damn near an accepted social and cultural norm.\n\n\n\nThe system of slavery helped us arrive at this place, where black girls are denied humanity. In captivity, their bodies were perpetually preyed upon. In bondage, they were much more than field hands and domestics. Not only did they have the duty of being medical lab rats, as was the case of Anarcha, Betsey and Lucy\u2014three slave girls used for gynecological experimentation by physician J. Marion Sims\u2014but they were also forced to sexually perform as bed wenches and breeders.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the most profound case, an enslaved Sally Hemings bore six children by her master, Thomas Jefferson, the first at age 15\u2014when he was 43. Because Jefferson kept her close, in a bedroom adjacent to his own, many historians make the mistake of romanticizing Hemings and Jefferson\u2019s relationship as some enchanting antebellum love affair, but we must be clear of its obvious implications. The dynamic between slaveholder and slave is one of absolute power. A sexual relationship between a fully grown man and an adolescent child is absolutely salacious. It is statutory rape\u2014albeit sanctioned by the laws of the land at the time.\n\n\n\nAnd although white supremacist, capitalist patriarchy serves as a springboard for society\u2019s well-established disregard of young black girls, the slave code ended 152 years ago. We all should know better and do better\u2014especially the black community.\n\nGrowing up between the late 1980s and early \u201990s, during the peak of the crack era, it was not uncommon to see fresh, baby-faced girls in the company of men who were well into their mid-20s or older. The practice of courting minors was not exclusive to any particular demographic of men. It included the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody\u2014and for the most part, they all had short eyes. These sexual predators, in the heart of many hoods, exacted power over teenage girls through fast cars, money and drugs.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Connecticut Alliance to End Sexual Violence, approximately 40 percent of black women report coercive sexual contact by age 18.\n\n\n\nI am no stranger to this lifestyle.\n\nI know firsthand about having one\u2019s virginity pounded into extinction, at the age of 14, for a pair of Reebok 54-11\u2019s and a pair of gold bangle earrings\u2014compliments of a 23-year-old fan. I was finessed. It was like taking candy from a baby, and it was also euphemized rape. Not one rational adult intervened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSexual predation, for many black girls, starts long before the age of sexual awareness. They become innocent victims in their own households, social settings, churches and schools under the guise of supervision. These girls are preyed upon by family members, community leaders, religious figures and educators. In a lot of cases, they are disappointed in and dismissed by adults they should be able to trust.\n\n\n\nSome are victim-shamed; others are disbelieved or silenced by threats, like those the now-13-year-old alleged victim of Jelani Maraj, the brother of rapper Nicki Minaj, describes; those experienced by 18-year-old Anna Chambers, who tells of having been sexually assaulted by two New York City police officers while detained; and those made against the unprecedented number of girls whose names we do not know\u2014yes, #ThemToo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSexual violence is projected onto black girls at a higher rate than it is onto other races and ethnicities. In the Fourth National Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect:\n\nAfrican-American women were 1.75 times more likely than white women to have experienced child sexual abuse.\n\n\n\nAfrican-American women were more likely to report the occurrence of child sexual abuse during adolescence.\n\n\n\nAfrican-American women were more likely to report an increased incidence of perpetrators living in the same household.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese facts are hella disturbing and reflect a culture of sexual violence against black girls that remains crickets as fuck. Where\u2019s the community outrage? Where is the overwhelming media coverage? For black girls, there is no black collective rallying against these crimes. There is no public shaming or takedown of sexual violators, because society gives zero fucks, and the black community protects its villains and devalues its girls.\n\nTarana Burke, founder of the #MeToo movement\u2014an initiative that supports young women surviving sexual assault\u2014agrees that in the black community, the value of girls is at an all-time low. \u201cWe all have to be accountable for how we view and protect and cast our black girls,\u201d Burke says.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a phone interview, she expressed that \u201cthe world diminishes black girls and the black community upholds it.\u201d This flagrant attitude toward young black women is the very thing that keeps R. Kelly in business and away from major media attention.\n\nBurke makes it clear that Weinstein and Kelly are of the same ilk. She notes that while the former receives a national flogging for sexually assaulting grown white women, the latter continues to get away unscathed for alleged sex crimes against underage black girls. Black people\u2019s allegiance to Kelly is reflective of how the black community celebrates its villains, and hints at the lack of value placed on young girls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlack people have to shift their way of thinking when it comes to black girls. We have to believe our young girls and recognize when they\u2019ve been violated. Support them.\u201d \u2014Tarana Burke\n\nAs simple as it seems, Burke\u2019s statement is a whole-ass word.\n\n\n\nBut what statement is Snoop Dogg making when he features R. Kelly at his wife\u2019s birthday event?

Like Robert Kelly, they ain\u2019t shit.\n\nWhen we seek accountability from others, perhaps we hold ourselves accountable as well, for aiding and abetting, for being quiet, for turning blind eyes to those in close proximity. \u2019Cause at the end of the day, if we\u2019re going to normalize pedophilia and sexual misconduct in our own spaces, perpetuated on our own girls, then we must acknowledge our own complicity\u2014admit that we, too, ain\u2019t shit.\n\nJustification for that type of foul ain\u2019t justice at all.

It was a fight she often waged with a quiet and graceful dignity, while simultaneously raising a family constantly under threat. And while she may not be considered the \u201cMother of the Freedom Movement\u201d\u2014a title typically assigned to Rosa Parks\u2014Coretta was undoubtedly one of its primary muses, a living, breathing symbol of the steadfastness of the American black woman in defense of her family and the freedom of her race.\n\nThe King Center notes:\n\nCoretta Scott King was one of the most influential women leaders in our world. Prepared by her family, education, and personality for a life committed to social justice and peace, she entered the world stage in 1955 as wife of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and as a leading participant in the American Civil Rights Movement. Her remarkable partnership with Dr. King resulted not only in four children, who became dedicated to carrying forward their parent\u2019s work, but also in a life devoted to the highest values of human dignity in service to social change. Mrs. King traveled throughout the world speaking out on behalf of racial and economic justice, women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights, gay and lesbian dignity, religious freedom, the needs of the poor and homeless, full-employment, health care, educational opportunities, nuclear disarmament and environmental justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFar before her time, Coretta Scott King also embodied the rare work-life balance so many of us are still seeking, gracefully managing to mother her four children with Martin while consistently supporting, speaking and creating for the movement\u2014including organizing the series of Freedom Concerts that functioned as vital fundraisers for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. And she did it all in inimitable style.\n\n\u201cI feel like the women are superheroes, too. And so, Coretta Scott King is a superhero. So she deserves to be honored.\u201d\n\nThe Glow Up recently spoke with legendary costumer Ruth E. Carter, designer of the much anticipated Black Panther (more on that to come soon). Carter was also tasked with bringing Coretta\u2014played by Carmen Ejogo\u2014and the women of the 1965 Alabama voting rights marches back to life for Ava DuVernay\u2019s 2014 film, Selma.

I believe that love is a byproduct of love. I believe that hate made love to an orange, had a petty-ass baby, and that\u2019s how we got the grapefruit. I believe that cats were put on earth to kill things. And I believe the universe recycles.\n\n\n\nReincarnation is real. When we stop breathing, our bodies will all eventually turn into the fuel for flowers and trees. Those trees will, in turn, take the fuel of our decomposed former selves and convert carbon dioxide into oxygen that a newborn baby will one day inhale for the first time. We are all dying. To die is to give life.\n\nAnd if my body becomes a tiny point in the circle of life, it only makes sense that my soul will also be reincarnated. I have no idea how the universe may use my factory-refurbished soul. I\u2019m cool with becoming a yak or a large-mouthed bass in the next life. (Fair warning to the universe: I am a terrible swimmer.) There is only one thing I pray I will never be:\n\nThe white man.\n\nNot a white man, but the white man. The perpetual oppressor of people. The kicker of teeth. He who places boot on neck. I pray to the man upstairs (I\u2019m getting my roof fixed right now) that when my soul is washed, dried and placed in the \u201cbarely used\u201d bin of the universal thrift shop, I am not remade into the white man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI often fling disdain at people who unknowingly participate in white-mannery. I believe that any white person not actively fighting to end every form of racism and oppression is an accomplice. I fault white people who sit silently while their fellow Caucasians say or do something racist when no one black is around. I consider them to be upholders of white supremacy as much as the cross burners or swastika wearers. They are \u201cthe white man,\u201d too.\n\nBut I realize I am a living, breathing double standard. I have not held myself accountable in the same way in which I hold white people\u2019s feet to the fire on the issue of race.\n\nI don\u2019t like groupthink, millennially correct phrases like \u201csafe spaces\u201d and \u201cmicroaggressions,\u201d and so I don\u2019t use the term \u201crape culture.\u201d But I realize we live in a society that doesn\u2019t just perpetuate sexism but promotes sexual assault with a culture of silence. And just as with racism, that willingness to turn our heads and not condemn sexual assault is an implicit signal that it is OK.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne night while I was having a few drinks with friends, a guy recognized someone at my table and came over to say hi. At some point during his conversation, the waitress came over, and out of nowhere, he asked this teenage-looking girl: \u201cCan you make it clap?\u201d\n\nEveryone knew it was kind of creepy, but I said, \u201cHey, man, what the fuck is wrong with you? That girl is, like, 16.\u201d He tried to laugh it off by joking: \u201cYou know what Keith Sweat said: She may be young, but ... \u201d\n\nBy then the rest of the people at the table agreed that he was being a little bit rapey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few months later, I was with the same friends at the same watering hole (what, motherfucker? It\u2019s not like I live in Paris. I\u2019m in Birmingham!), and they began telling me about a high school teacher who had been arrested on charges that he slept with multiple students. Because I\u2019m not originally from this town (and apparently only go to one place to have drinks), I assumed that I didn\u2019t know who they were talking about.\n\nIt was the same rapey table crasher.\n\nHere\u2019s my point. I\u2019m not insinuating that every guy who makes suggestive comments to a Buffalo Wild Wings waitress is a potential sexual assaulter. But I wonder how often we perpetuate the ideology of the disposability of women\u2019s bodies by just not saying shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we are honest, every single man has known a guy who was a habitual line stepper when it came to women or who was a little bit rapey. The frat brother who will grab a random woman\u2019s booty. The boss who has tried to fuck everyone in the office. The football teammate who always talks about \u201crunning a train.\u201d I also believe every single white person has a parent, co-worker or cousin (wait ... do white people have cousins?) who leans a \u201clittle bit racist.\u201d\n\nBut just like there is no such thing as being a little bit racist, there is no such thing as being \u201ca little bit rapey.\u201d\n\nWhy are we cool with one and not the other?\n\nIf we refused to remain quiet about the dudes who do this shit, I\u2019m not saying that it would end sexual assault, but it might curtail the actions of the men whose actions are fueled by the complicity of silence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEveryone knew about Harvey Weinstein and didn\u2019t say shit. Bill Cosby\u2019s predilection for slipping Mickeys was an open secret for decades. Do you think R. Kelly\u2019s friends are just now noticing that some of the girls surrounding him are a little short in the tooth?\n\nI know some woke-ass dudes who would open-hand smack a Caucasian\u2019s face off if the white person uttered the word \u201cnigger\u201d in their presence, even if that person wasn\u2019t using the n-word in reference to anyone in particular. It wouldn\u2019t matter if the recipient of the smack were singing along to a Tupac song or used the version of the word with the \u201ca\u201d at the end\u2014he or she would become an unwilling participant in the catching of hands.\n\nBut those same woke-ass dudes wouldn\u2019t say a damn word if a guy talked about \u201ctaking some pussy\u201d or brought up booty-clapping to a teenager trying to do her job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe ain\u2019t shit.\n\nAnd I know some dude out there will argue that not every black man is complicit in sexual assault.

The portraits, by Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald respectively\u2014both black painters\u2014are such sharp departures from any previous depictions of a president and first lady that reviews were understandably mixed, even amongst our own crew here at The Root (including yours truly).\n\n\n\nEspecially when considering Mrs. Obama\u2019s portrait, it took a moment to reconcile her portrayal with our expectations. Where was the warmth we\u2019d become so accustomed to during the Obama era? The radiant smile? The glorious brown skin?\n\nWhile Wiley\u2019s portrait of our 44th President\u2019s portrait seemed lush and even playful\u2014if whimsically unconventional for a leader of the free world\u2014Sherald\u2019s portrait of his wife, posed similarly to Rodin\u2019s The Thinker, seemed to almost recede by comparison, like a cherished photograph that had already faded much too soon for our comfort. To some of us, it seemed more like a suggestion of our favorite first lady, rather than a portrait of the lady herself.\n\nAnd yet, in the days since\u2014for this writer, at least\u2014it has been difficult not to return to look at it again and again.\n\nAs Doreen St. Felix wrote in a wonderful analysis for the New Yorker:\n\nThe racializing schema of Sherald\u2019s work is to \u2018exclude the idea of color as race,\u2019 she has said, in her artist\u2019s statement. To Sherald, the photorealistic depiction of race\u2014a quality determined by others\u2019 eyes, externally\u2014is a dead end. Applied to Michelle Obama, the lack of brown in the skin feels first like a loss, and then like a real gain. This is a different Michelle, a woman evacuated of celebrity, who appears provisionally dreamlike, nearly a shadow. The mouth and the eyes and the strong arms that we know are present, but fainter. From some distance, I can imagine, the figure might not be immediately recognizable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf the many things that have been written about Mrs. Obama\u2019s portrait since its unveiling last Monday, several articles have focused on the dress she chose to be immortalized in, made by American (semi)affordable luxury label Milly, designed by Michelle Smith. Indeed, it is the most visually striking element of the portrait, featuring graphic-patterned patches in black, red, yellow, pink and beige, scattered across the white foreground of the skirt. It drapes across Mrs. Obama\u2019s lap in much the same way I remember quilts draping across my Mississippian great-grandmother\u2019s lap decades ago.\n\nMany have been quick to make the same comparison, especially noting similarities between Mrs. Obama\u2019s dress and the famously graphic geometric quilts created for over a century in Gee\u2019s Bend, Alabama. At the unveiling, artist Amy Sherald spoke to the similarities herself, saying:\n\nThe dress chosen for this painting was designed by Milly. It has an abstract pattern that reminded me of the Dutch artist Piet Mondrian\u2019s geometric paintings. But Milly\u2019s design also resembles the inspired quilt masterpieces made by the women of Gee\u2019s Bend, a small remote black community in Alabama where they compose quilts in geometries that transform clothes and fabric remnants into masterpieces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut designer Smith apparently had no such correlation in mind when she created the print. She spoke to Vogue about the dress, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s made of a stretch cotton poplin print in a clean, minimal, geometric print without a reference to anything past or nostalgic, which gives the dress a very forward-thinking sensibility\u2014this is very Michelle Obama.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut while Michelle Smith may not have read a metaphor for quilting in her own work, is it safe for her to assume that a woman as aware and astute as Michelle Obama\u2014well known for her strategic sartorial statements\u2014didn\u2019t? Aside from evoking the great American southern tradition of quilting\u2014as well as the stars and stripes famously handsewn for this country\u2014is it so outlandish to consider that her gown might also evoke the racial patchwork that comprises the country her husband so recently led?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo glean more insight, The Glow Up spoke with textile artist, clothing designer, children\u2019s book author and illustrator, and master quilter Cozbi Cabrera, a 2017 Lincoln Center artist-in-residence whose own quilts have been shown in the Myrtle Beach Art Museum, concurrent with an exhibit on the quilters of Gee\u2019s Bend. Like many others, she isn\u2019t so quick to discredit the correlation between the white American designer dress and the black American South.\n\nWell, I think for starters that designers have to be aware that they are influenced greatly, and that fashion overall is derivative. So, whether we are doing it consciously or subconsciously, there is something about putting all of these elements together that\u2019s going to strike a chord or trigger a memory or something. So, I think that she\u2019s probably not being\u2014I wouldn\u2019t even use the word \u2018truthful\u2019\u2014I think that she\u2019s probably not being aware of this idea that fashion is derivative. So, it comes from somewhere. And I think that rightfully so, [Amy Sherald\u2019s] notion of her choice is very telling as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCabrera is also quick to note the very \u201cAmerican story\u201d of Gee\u2019s Bend, an isolated peninsula about 35 miles southwest of Selma, Alabama, with a population of less than 300, according to the 2010 Census. Primarily African-American and reachable almost exclusively by ferry, in 1965, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. visited the enclave three weeks before Selma\u2019s \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d to encourage voter registration. However, three years before, Alabama\u2019s government had shut down ferry service to nearby Camden, further isolating the community from basic necessities like medical attention, employment, and participation in the democratic process.\n\nAnd yet, even in isolation, their traditions continued. In 2002, the Whitney Museum in New York mounted a show of the quilts of Gee\u2019s Bend, to rave reviews. The New York Times\u2019 art critic called them \u201ceye-poppingly gorgeous,\u201d while others marveled at the fact that these modernist creations could have generated within a place seemingly cut off from inspiration, as Cabrera notes:\n\n[T]heir quilts showed up at the Whitney Museum in New York, and the reviews came back that what they were doing rivaled anything that you\u2019d find in 20th-century art. ... how could it be? How could they have these sophisticated influences if they were in isolation? And it\u2019s almost like an assumption that the creator\u2014or what I would call the Divine\u2014sort of sprinkles sophistication and aesthetic instincts only on a particular group of people, in only a particular geographic location, you know?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilarly, Cabrera believes it may be short-sighted to underestimate the deep significance and skill in Sherald\u2019s portrait of Michelle Obama\u2014or to assume the former First Lady\u2019s intentions in choosing her for the commission. Because ultimately, isn\u2019t art\u2014like beauty\u2014in the eye of the beholder?\n\nI think that in a less masterful hand, most people have a tendency to kind of throw in the kitchen sink, and in my mind, [Sherald] made some very deliberate choices as to what to leave out and what was left was the likeness of Michelle Obama. So we got that it was her\u2014you know it was quite a bit of fluidity of line, and then these elements of patch. All that\u2019s left in my mind visually were the essentials to kind of like, tell the story. How [Milly designer Michelle Smith] might feel about that, I think it\u2019s almost not even relevant because I think that the larger community got what was being communicated.

So, of course, when New York Fashion Week and Black Panther premiere week collided Monday night, there was a presentation inspired by Oscar winner Ruth E. Carter\u2019s costumes from the film.\n\n\n\nThe \u201cWelcome to Wakanda\u201d fashion presentation had guests lined up around West 12th Street in New York City dressed in their most regal Ankara couture to get inside Industria Studios, the fashion-centric studio space and event venue where designs from Chromat, Cushnie et Ochs, Fear of God, Ikir\u00e9 Jones, LaQuan Smith, Sophie Theallet and Tome were on display.\n\nThe immersion into Wakanda began with the walls, covered in leaves that branched out like ivy. At the entrance into the concrete jungle sat the blue Lexus LC 500 used during the film, with slashes from the Black Panther across its hood. Inside the purple-lit studio, seven stunning models posed in bespoke couture designs while standing on a moss-covered stage. Golden thrones were positioned on the stage like arrows on a compass, giving guests the hottest backdrop to flex on the \u2019gram.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Industria really transformed into Wakanda when the stars of Black Panther\u2014Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Danai Gurira and Winston Duke\u2014held court on the black carpet. Mingling with guests and posing with the models inspired by their characters, the stars lit up the venue, taking laps around the stage and selfies with guests who dined on Wakanda Patties, made of chickpea and roast yam, and Cricket Tarts, made of chocolate-roasted crickets. Guests sipped signature drinks as artist and DJ Heron Preston kept the crowd\u2014and singer Elle Varner\u2014dancing till long past last call. Clearly, it\u2019s lit in Wakanda.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the bar closed, even after the lights came up and janitors began sweeping up the floor, the crowds still didn\u2019t disperse, wanting to stay in the safe haven of black excellence just a little while longer. But with gift bags from event sponsor Redken in hand, the guests eventually shuffled off into the night, counting down the days till they can get back to the affirming space carved into existence by Black Panther.\n\n\n\nFortunately, the joy of the evening will continue on, as the seven bespoke pieces will be auctioned off by CharityBuzz to benefit the international humanitarian organization Save the Children. And the film-inspired capsule collections that were on display by shoe-and-accessories designer Brother Vellies, Black Panther jewelry and armor designer and official jeweler Douriean, and knitwear designer Josh Bennett are on sale today, Tuesday, for all the fans who want to keep the magic alive. #WakandaForever, indeed!", "keywords": ["welcome", "till", "black", "panther", "stage", "venue", "york", "designer", "week", "bnyfw", "wakanda", "guests"], "polarity": 0.10379182449494952, "subjectivity": 0.4061868686868687},

Kelly\u2019s alleged predatory behavior, providing the umpteenth reminder that the singer continues to hide in plain sight. In \u201cSurviving R. Kelly,\u201d former DJ Kitti Jones recounts her past relationship with Kelly and accuses him of physically abusing her, forcing her to have sex with other women, and urinating on her. During a particularly scary fight, she says, \u201cMy heart was just beating through my chest...He just turned into a monster.\u201d\n\nIt is an agonizing account of an abusive relationship, and it\u2019s not the only one out there. In a fairer world, R. Kelly should be rotting in a prison cell in a state of perpetual irritation that he\u2019ll never get to perform \u201cBump \u2018N Grind\u201d outside any venue not under the control of the Illinois Department of Corrections. No amount of \u201cgenius\u201d\u2014which has been long cited by fans who continue to monetarily support him in spite of a now decades-old accusations of inappropriate sexual relationships with minors\u2014can excuse anyone\u2019s predatory behavior.\n\nR. Kelly, his chocolate factory, his Zorro-inspired masks, his chitlin-play esque \u201cTrapped In The Closet\u201d series, his fake-ass Sam Cooke impersonations, and most of all, his incessant and at times antagonistic displays of overt sexuality in his music and accompanying imagery should have never happened, and the man behind it all should be rendered a pariah expelled from the pop cultural zeitgeist.\n\n\n\nInstead, in 2017, R. Kelly continues to thrive as an artist. What makes this all the more infuriating is that the Rolling Stone report comes at a moment in history in which powerful, predatory men are facing repercussions for their behavior.\n\n\n\nWhat will it take to get more of us to give a damn about R. Kelly\u2019s alleged crimes? The answer may lie in who his victims are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarvey Weinstein may reportedly remain dedicated to making films in the future despite being marred in scandal and now presently under investigation for rape, but for all intents and purposes, he is done in Hollywood. Bill Cosby may or may not face prison time over allegations of rape, but his legacy is forever tarnished and he, a self-important moralizer to poor black people, has been exposed as a hypocrite. Moreover, if Page Six is correct that the comedian is taking $30 million loan against his Upper East Side townhouse to pay for his mounting legal bills as he prepares for retrial for sexual assault, his fortune is shrinking. Cosby\u2019s millions were built on a lie and used to obstruct justice and continue to violate women\u2019s autonomy: Let him die broke.\n\n\n\nWe also now know just how much sexual harassment permeated the workplace at Fox News. Reports of said harassment led to the ouster of the late Roger Ailes, who served as chairman and CEO of Fox News, and later, its biggest star, Bill O\u2019Reilly. In the case of O\u2019Reilly, who is actively seeking a return to television, we are still learning details about how willing Fox News was to look the other way at allegations of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s sexual harassment for the sake of ratings.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, CNN reported that political analyst, author, and regular regurgitation of bullshit Mark Halperin sexually harassed and assaulted numerous women during his time as ABC News political director. Already, MSNBC has released a statement: \u201cWe find the story and the allegations very troubling. Mark Halperin is leaving his role as a contributor until the questions around his past conduct are fully understood.\u201d Time will likely not be kind to Halperin, who infamously referred to then-President Obama as a \u201cdick.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGood riddance.\n\nAnd yet, nothing has happened to R. Kelly despite similar reporting. This summer, Buzzfeed published a story that alleged Kelly has maintained a \u201csex cult.\u201d The gruesome details therein\u2014that he forces women to call him \u201cdaddy\u201d and controls every aspect of their lives, down to when they can urinate\u2014made the story go viral, but the tour went on and those who have continued to collaborate with him offered no comments on it. Shortly thereafter, Jezebel published an interview with another alleged former girlfriend who repeated some of the same accusations found in the Buzzfeed expose. The reporter behind the piece, Jim DeRogatis, has tried to warn the public about Kelly since his days as the pop music critic at the Chicago Sun-Times.\n\n\n\nR. Kelly has been particularly smug and open about his predatory antics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of that Kelly from touring\u2014with the likes of successful female artists such as Monica and LeToya Luckett on the tour bill. One skim of Ticketmaster reveals that Kelly has arena tour dates through the end of the year. Kelly also remains a fixture on the radio. And based on Sam Smith wearing a T-shirt with his face plastered on it, Kelly remains a figure whose reverence is expanding with future generations rather than rightfully dying. Worse, many of his fans continue to be willfully ignorant about the accusations leveled against him. Because if you are buying a ticket to see R. Kelly perform, you are choosing to align yourself with a predator and dancing along to him in total complicity.\n\n\n\nWhat will it take to get more of us to give a damn about R. Kelly\u2019s alleged crimes? The answer may lie in who his victims are.\n\nThe difference between Kelly and other powerful men like Weinstein and Ailes is that Kelly\u2019s accusers are primarily black girls and women. Black girls and women who are young or underage. Black girls and women who are poor or working class, particularly the ones involved in the cases DeRogatis investigated decades ago. Black girls and women who are not famous. It is also not easy for black girls and women of means and notoriety to earn the respect they deserve, so the burden on those without either to get people to care is even higher.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Weinstein, no matter how powerful, could not match the celebrity of his accusers, which ranged from Mira Sorvino to Ashley Judd. Many of the women accusing Cosby of assault were white women; the most high-profile non-white accuser, legendary black model Beverly Johnson, was already famous. One can\u2019t be certain that it was all white women accusing Halperin and O\u2019Reilly of sexual misconduct and harassment respectively, but it is a reasonable assumption that most of them were, given the lack of diversity at mainstream media outlets. The same can be said of Megyn Kelly, a blond, white Fox News anchor and household name who spoke out against Ailes, effectively sealing his fate.\n\nOf course, R. Kelly isn\u2019t the only alleged predator thriving despite widespread rumors of abuse. Woody Allen continues to work with Hollywood\u2019s young actresses and veteran Oscar winners despite allegations that he molested Mia Farrow\u2019s adopted daughter, Dylan. Then there is the 45th president of the United States, the self-congratulating pussy grabber.\n\nBut R. Kelly has been particularly smug and open about his predatory antics. His accusations have followed him for 20 years and he\u2019s left not only a widely reported paper trail in legal settlements, but in interviews when asked about whether he liked teenager girls, answered, first asked for clarification on how young in age constituted a teen. He was openly married to a teenage Aaliyah in the 1990s. When Kelly was acquitted on 14 counts of child pornography, five jurors claimed the absence of testimony from the alleged victim served as \u201cbig handicap\u201d in the prosecutor\u2019s case\u2014a case that took prosecutors six years to get to trial.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all know who R. Kelly really is. The question is whether he will he ever face any consequences. It may take a critical mass of victims to speak out, like in the cases of Cosby and Weinstein. But if the past is prologue, there is reason to worry. And even if Kelly finally faces the public banishment his accused behavior has commanded, it needn\u2019t ever be lost on us why it took so long to happen.", "keywords": ["weinstein", "meet", "predatory", "black", "particularly", "kelly", "harvey", "girls", "fate", "women", "r", "sexual", "alleged"], "polarity": 0.052174408014571946, "subjectivity": 0.4308380371904962},

Kelly\u2019s ex-girlfriends has come forward in a Rolling Stone article with new allegations of sexual, emotional and physical abuse against the R&B singer.\n\nKitti Jones, a former radio DJ, cataloged the entire dizzying, two-year relationship with the \u201cPied Piper\u201d of R&B to the magazine, describing how they met (at an after-party following his Dallas concert), his \u201ccourteous courtship\u201d of her, and the escalating incidents of abusive behavior that came to characterize their relationship.\n\nThe story follows a blockbuster BuzzFeed report from Jim DeRogatis, who has followed sexual abuse allegations against Robert Kelly for decades. That story details multiple claims that Kelly held women against their will in a \u201ccult.\u201d Jones was among DeRogatis\u2019 sources.\n\nBelow are some of the most troubling, brutal allegations from Jones, according to the report:\n\nOn meeting R. Kelly at a hotel for the first time:\n\n\u201cI got there before he did because he of course doesn\u2019t like to fly, so he\u2019s taking the bus,\u201d Jones says. She had sent Kelly \u201cracy photos\u201d while he was en route to the hotel and was excited to reunite face-to-face. As she waited in the hotel room for Kelly to arrive, she heard a knock at the door. \u201cHe brushed past me,\u201d Jones says. \u201cI\u2019m thinking we\u2019re going to hug or peck each other. But he plopped down on the couch and pulled out his penis and started pleasuring himself.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones told Rolling Stone she was stunned by Kelly\u2019s audacity and said that if he had been \u201ca regular guy working at CVS\u201d she would have been furious, but she was entranced by months of communication and flirting. Still, looking back, she said, there were warning signs:\n\n\u201cI was attracted to him and was just like, \u2018Well, OK. Fine,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe he just has weird ways of getting off.\u201d The two had oral sex that weekend, with Kelly, according to Jones, saying things like, \u201cI gotta teach you how to be with me\u201d and \u201cI gotta train you.\u201d \u201cHe was like a drill sergeant even when he was pleasuring me,\u201d Jones says. \u201cHe was telling me how to bend my back or move my leg here. I\u2019m like, \u2018Why is he directing it like this?\u2019 It was very uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nOn how R. Kelly\u2019s behavior changed once she moved out to Chicago to be with him:\n\nAlmost instantly upon moving to Chicago, Jones says, Kelly began governing nearly every detail of her life, starting with the requirement that she wear baggy sweatpants whenever she went out and text near-constant updates on her whereabouts. (A source who knew Kelly confirmed the singer\u2019s demands on Jones to Rolling Stone.) Jones says she was forced to text either the singer or one of his employees for even the slightest request. (Sample text message: \u201cDaddy, I need to go to the restroom.\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the day Jones confronted him about the infamous tape that shows the singer allegedly urinating on a teenage girl:\n\nJones had been living with Kelly for less than a month when she claims the first instance of physical abuse occurred, in November 2011. Jones says that on a return trip to Dallas around Thanksgiving, she saw for the first time the video at the heart of his child-pornography trial and challenged Kelly on the phone about it. \u201cHe said, \u2018Bitch, don\u2019t you ever fucking accuse me of something like that,\u2019\u201d Jones says. \u201cHe never had spoken to me like that before.\u201d\n\n\n\nJones claims Kelly remained enraged when she flew back and met him at the airport. \u201cMy heart was just beating through my chest,\u201d she says. \u201cHe just turned into a monster. I blamed myself \u2018cause I was like, \u2018Maybe I shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve said anything.\u2019\u201d As they drove home, Jones says she repeatedly apologized while Kelly kicked her multiple times and delivered a series of open-handed slaps to her face. \u201cI was putting my hand over my face and telling him I was sorry,\u201d Jones says. \u201cHe would start kicking me, telling me I was a stupid bitch [and] don\u2019t ever get in his business.\u201d The next day, Jones says, the couple went shopping and neither spoke about the incident.\n\nOn how Kelly\u2019s manipulation escalated when Jones was moved into a home with two of Kelly\u2019s other girlfriends:\n\nThere were no locks on the doors, but cameras monitored every move and Kelly would punish the women for attempting to leave for any reason without permission. (The source who knew Kelly independently confirmed Kelly\u2019s rules with his girlfriends to Rolling Stone.) Kelly would frequently take away Jones\u2019 phone as punishment\u2014sometimes as long as two months\u2014cutting off her ability to request food or perform basic functions, according to Jones and the other source who knew him.\n\nTwo months into living at the studio, Jones says, Kelly began using starvation on her as punishment for not following his orders.

It\u2019s so traumatic the things that he makes you do to other people and to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe videotapes everything that he does, and sometimes he\u2019ll just make you watch what he\u2019s done to other girls or girls that he had be together,\u201d she adds. \u201cHe would masturbate to that and then have you give him oral sex while he\u2019s watching what he did with somebody else on his iPad.\u201d\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is arguably most disturbing about Jones\u2019 described relationship with Kelly is her self-admitted protectiveness of the singer, even after she said he routinely isolated her, demeaned her, starved her and forced her into nonconsensual sex acts. After Jones severed her romantic relationship with Kelly in 2013, she told Rolling Stone that she reached out to the singer after a tense video interview with the Huffington Post.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, my God, poor thing,\u2019\u201d Jones told the magazine.\n\nNow, Jones says, she is coming forward with her story because she wants other women to speak up about abuse they\u2019ve suffered at Kelly\u2019s hands, and to encourage the public to take the decades of allegations seriously.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI want them to not be so dismissive towards the women that are speaking out,\u201d says Jones, who, Rolling Stone reports, is currently exploring her legal options against the singer.\n\nDespite the swirl of allegations that have followed Kelly throughout the career, there is currently no open criminal investigation against him.\n\n\n\nRead more at Rolling Stone.", "keywords": ["kellys", "allegations", "kelly", "jones", "recentand", "stone", "rolling", "sex", "women", "abuse", "report", "launched", "r", "disturbingabuse", "singer"], "polarity": -0.020709918736234536, "subjectivity": 0.42943452746084326},

The FBI also discovered that Salman may have given her husband some gas money that he used in his car.\n\nSo despite the fact that she denounced the Islamic State group and terrorism a year before the attack, even though she did not help plan or finance the shooting, Salam will stand trial in March for aiding and abetting by providing material support to a terrorist organization.\n\nIn the eyes of the government, Noor Salman is a terrorist.\n\n\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Stephen Miller, government staffers and other officials sat in the room and heard President Donald Trump disparage Haiti as a \u201cshithole country.\u201d They did not challenge him. None of the lawmakers who probably represent Haitians and Nigerians walked out of the room and told the press about Trump\u2019s tirade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the fact that there is no evidence any of these men encouraged Trump to say these words, even though they did not endorse his statement, they remained silent. They knew.\n\nThese men are white supremacists.\n\nEvery headline you will read about Trump\u2019s comments will place the blame solely on him and adeptly leap over the obvious fact that he felt comfortable enough in the company of this gaggle of old white men to disparage the residents of an entire country with his racist tangent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe recent revelations are not just an indictment of Trump\u2019s racism; they are indicative of the attitudes of every single person in that room.\n\nThat\u2019s how white supremacy works.\n\nThis has nothing to do with the ethereal concept of \u201cnormalizing\u201d racism. This is a brick-and-mortar example of how men nonchalantly spread the evil form of oppression that has plagued this country for centuries and then lackadaisically go about their business as if nothing happened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause for them, nothing happened.\n\n\u201cHe who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it.\u201d \u2014Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nThis weekend and Monday, America will celebrate the legacy of the civil rights revolutionary Martin Luther King Jr. Whenever any black person utters words that make white people adjust their collars, white people unfailingly respond with a variation of the phrase \u201cbut not all white people.\u201d If they are bold enough, they might even challenge you with the Super Saiyan Caucasian preamble of all preambles: \u201cWhat would Martin Luther King say about ... \u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, on this particular issue, we know what King would have said because he already said it.\n\nIn 1964, after he won the Nobel Peace Prize, most of white Atlanta didn\u2019t acknowledge it. The city where he was born and where he lived didn\u2019t even try to honor King until Robert Woodruff, president of Coca-Cola, decided to sponsor a banquet. He still couldn\u2019t get the white elite to attend until the New York Times wrote a scathing article about the efforts to undermine the event and Coca-Cola threatened to leave the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the tickets sold out, many people assumed that King would take it easy on the powerful people who had reluctantly gathered to honor him. When he gave his speech, he spoke directly to the powerful men who had remained quiet during the brutality of the civil rights movement:\n\nHistory will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. was wrong, though.\n\nHistory has yet to record the tragedy of the people who sat silently in the room on Thursday when Trump besmirched the nation of Haiti and other black and brown countries. History still has not listed the names in the room when he said that Haitians \u201call have AIDS\u201d and Nigerians live in huts. Their names are nowhere to be found alongside the list of neo-Nazis and Klansmen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only was King incorrect when he assured us of history\u2019s note-taking, but he was doubly wrong when he described the people who remained appallingly silent as \u201cgood people.\u201d Sidestepping evil for the sake of political favor or not upsetting the apple cart is the opposite of \u201cgood.\u201d These people are co-conspirators. They are accomplices. They are guilty of aiding and abetting by providing material support to white supremacy.\n\nNot only are they at fault, but they join a long list of those complicit with Trump\u2019s brand of racism. Their names should appear alongside those of the pearl-clutching congregation of reporters, celebrities and generic-label white people distancing themselves from \u201cthe Donald\u201d as they pretend to just realize that he has racist tendencies.\n\nThey should register with the 53 percent of white women who voted for a robeless Klansman, along with the lawmakers who embrace him and his policies. The names of kowtowing Negroes like Steve Harvey, Ray Lewis, Stephen A. Smith, Omarosa Manigault Newman and Chrisette Michele, who implored us to respect a man who would shit down our throats for the spectacle of it, should be etched into those history books, too. They all worked on the road crew that paved the way for a white supremacist to gain respect and power. They paid for the fuel in his car.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is why I am never ashamed to say that I voted for someone just because he or she is black. This is why \u201cdiversity\u201d can never be a bad word. If we are not seated at the table, not only are our voices unheard, but the evil ones are emboldened. This is why \u201cnot all white people\u201d rings hollow in my ears. All the white people in the room at both events stayed silent. Silence is racism. Racism is evil.\n\nThose same silent voices omitted from history will probably participate in the praising of Martin Luther King Jr. this weekend. They will talk about freedom and equality for all people. They will do it loudly and publicly because they know that they will always have the opportunity to slit our throats behind closed doors without a single objection.\n\nOur only hope remains in the unseen recompense of the invisible, omnipotent God who King believed would avenge the sins of these evil men. He told us: \u201cThe hottest place in hell is reserved for those who remain neutral in times of great moral conflict.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI guess we\u2019ll have to wait for that.\n\nI just hope they don\u2019t run out of room.", "keywords": ["trumps", "luther", "martin", "silence", "racism", "names", "evil", "jr", "white", "shithole", "silent", "room", "say", "king", "men"], "polarity": -0.049145809490637064, "subjectivity": 0.4577242042759285},

Cole and Walker had only been dead for about two weeks, having been crushed to death by a faulty, outdated garbage truck, but their co-workers felt an ancestral rage that had been building for generations.\n\nMemphis sanitation workers, terrified that any one of them could be next, organized and demanded better safety standards and livable wages; they also demanded that their union, which, in 1964, had been granted charter by the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), finally be recognized.\n\n\n\nThe union had not had much support among the men prior to Cole\u2019s and Walker\u2019s deaths, but it was time. Sanitation workers were sick and tired of being sick and tired. They were angry and motivated to leave the world a better place, a more equitable place, for their children.\n\n\n\nThey were ready.\n\n\n\nOn Feb. 23, after the city of Memphis failed to deliver on its flimsy promises, they knew it was time to march. It was time to march toward a freedom that they could only imagine, but one that they felt in their bones was possible. So, facing violent police officers wielding mace and billy clubs, they marched. They ignored the stares and the slurs, and they marched.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, when black people in the United States organize around liberation, there are white people who view it as radical extremism; it is also viewed by the state as insurrection. Now, envision the deep south in 1968, three years after the ostensible end of Jim Crow. White people in Memphis were convinced that the sanitation strikers needed to be broken if they couldn\u2019t be grateful for their jobs.\n\nAs shown in \u201cThe Sharecroppers,\u201d episode 3 of 1300 Men: Memphis Strike \u201968, many of the strikers had migrated from rural Mississippi and, for them, Henry Loeb was nothing more than a citified plantation boss. Loeb served two terms as mayor (1960-1963; 1968-1971) and was open about his abiding love for state\u2019s rights and segregation. He once called for a \u201cwhite unity\u201d ticket in an attempt to suppress the black vote in Memphis. Loeb did not hesitate to sic police officers on sanitation strikers, their families and their supporters\u2014including Gladys Carpenter, a veteran organizer who was present at both the 1965 Selma march and the Meredith March Against Fear. Some marchers suspected that Loeb ordered police officers to bump them with their cars; one of these officers ran over Carpenter\u2019s foot.\n\n\n\nLoeb was on the front line, fighting a war against progress and equity as if his life depended on it. Come hell or high water, they were going to put these \u201cboys\u201d in their places.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn episode 4 of 1300 Men: Memphis Strike \u201968, we take a look at what happened in Memphis when sanitation workers grew tired of fighting for crumbs from the white man\u2019s table\u2014and dying, slowly or quickly, in the process.\n\nFollow @TheRoot and @strikingvoices along with the hashtag #1300Men on Twitter as we begin \u201clive\u201d-tweeting historical moments from the strike starting Feb. 1.\n\n", "keywords": ["workers", "watch", "sick", "strikers", "strike", "sanitation", "officers", "memphis", "men", "white", "tired", "loeb"], "polarity": -0.01156973461321289, "subjectivity": 0.4598757763975156},

Artist Kehinde Wiley portrays the former president as concerned, probing, and calm, with just the faintest hint of a smirk playing across his lips; he is settled within a radiant, repeating wall of foliage, faintly obscured where his shoes nestle into the overgrowth. As presidential portraits go, it\u2019s bold, opinionated, and utterly modern.

In point of fact, he thinks there is \u201csecret sperm\u201d on the painting, and it frightens him. This is not a euphemism; he thinks that Wiley painted jizz onto Obama\u2019s face.

It moves on from there to note that the artist once sardonically used the phrase \u201ckill whitey\u201d in a New York magazine profile, which at least has the virtue of being true, unlike the claim that he put sperm in his painting of Barack Obama, which is objectively not true.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look, just to be sure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYep, definitely just a person\u2019s face.

I\u2019ve also permanently banned all R. Kelly music from my life. I also believe that some police are racist and allow that racism to decide how they are going to handle a situation involving African Americans before they\u2019ve even encountered them.\n\nAs such, I believe that kneeling during the national anthem is not only the righteous thing for NFL players to do but is also the morally just thing to do. I understand that many African Americans don\u2019t share my view; in fact, the one thing we can all agree on is that when it comes to protesting, we don\u2019t all agree. So I\u2019ve compiled a list of 10 things that I know all black people will protest.\n\n\n\n1. No Altering the Menu at Starbucks\n\nWe love to customize shit. Even noncustomizable shit\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter. Cars, teeth, nails, hair, skin\u2014we will customize the fuck out of it. And nothing is more customizable than a Starbucks drink order.\n\nNot being allowed to walk into a Starbucks and order a \u201ctallande* double-whip, no-foam mochaccino with unicorn sprinkles and elf tears, stirred with the ivory tusk of a baby elephant\u201d will turn black America upside down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n*A tallande is where you cut a tall cup in half and staple it to the top of grande cup. And yes, it\u2019s still smaller than a venti.\n\n2. No Child Tax Credit\n\nTax season is arguably the flossiest season of all time. We Birdman hand-rub in anticipation of tax season, and that nice little Child Tax Credit bump is already planned into everyone\u2019s budget. Does it offset the cost of having a child? Hell no, but once it hits, you know you can finally make that dermatologist appointment and get the extra skin-care products that they keep in the locked glass case at CVS. Buying fancy skin care and making a dermatology appointment is balling to people of a certain age.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Popeyes Decides to Never Bring Back the $5 Big Box\n\nBlack people love to back away from chicken. In fact, just seeing this as a protest topic has made some black folks cringe. It\u2019s a cultural embarrassment, and in truth, we shouldn\u2019t love chicken so much, but we do. And this feels like a safe space to admit it. You know what else we love as much as chicken? Discounts. So when Popeyes has the $5 Big Box, we send out group texts letting each other know. Let Popeyes try and shut this down and watch how quickly we mobilize.\n\n4. A Nationwide Shortage of Talenti Gelato\n\nBlack people love fancy ice cream, and it doesn\u2019t get much fancier than this. I have often said that if you want me to be there, then you have to have Talenti gelato. I have left parties early because they didn\u2019t have it. On the promise of Talenti gelato, I will protest while holding a tiki torch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. The Lottery Stops the Three- and Four-Digit Number\n\nI don\u2019t know anyone who has ever hit the number. Wait, I take that back\u2014my dad once hit the number, and it wasn\u2019t so much that he hit the number as it was the story of how the number came to him. Black people dream numbers. Family members who have passed to the other side send numbers back in dreams. My dad believes to this day that he didn\u2019t hit the number so much as it was destined for him to hit the number. He dreamed it and played it and won a pretty good amount of money. \u201cThe numbers\u201d are a staple in the black community, and taking it away would literally be like taking the black community\u2019s dreams. It\u2019s low-level investing, and stopping it would cause a nationwide black panic.\n\n6. The Disappearance of the Shirtless Snake Guy\n\nSince I was a boy, the shirtless snake guy has been a part of my collective memory. He was at every health care expo, Taste of the City, 8th Street Festival, Beach Week. If there was a monument to universal blackness, it would be a shirtless muscular black man with a snake around his neck or arm. He\u2019s a fixture at all black outdoor universal summer events, and his disappearance would cause mass hysteria in the black community because for once, we\u2019d all finally agree that without him, there is a glitch in the matrix.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. No More Macy\u2019s Coupons\n\nLook, I don\u2019t want to stereotype, but here comes some crazy-big stereotyping: Black women love Macy\u2019s. Older black women would marry Macy\u2019s if they could. My mom does all her Christmas shopping at Macy\u2019s, and on the off chance that she couldn\u2019t find something for one of us at Macy\u2019s, then you know what we\u2019re getting for Christmas? That\u2019s right, you guessed it: a Macy\u2019s gift card.\n\nAs such, black women live for the coupons that come in the mail and the ones online. If Macy\u2019s stopped with the coupons, black women would shut it down. And black men would follow suit, if for no other reason than to get their women out of the house on Sunday so they can secretly watch the football they are supposed to be boycotting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Frank\u2019s Hot Sauce Becomes the Official Hot Sauce of America\n\nThe Root\u2019s official hot-sauce aficionado, Lawrence Ware, once exclaimed that Frank\u2019s RedHot is the \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d of hot sauce. Truthfully, Frank\u2019s hot sauce is trash. It\u2019s basically spicy water, and declaring this the official hot sauce of America would not only infuriate scores of American-born black folks\u2014it would increase the black market on Caribbean-made pepper sauce, which is basically the moonshine of hot sauces.\n\n9. A Nationwide Ban on Slamming Dominoes and Pasting Big Jokers on Your Forehead\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to play dominoes without slamming them, and I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to play spades without someone at some point pasting a big Joker on his or her forehead because the nature of both games, mixed with showboat ancestry, requires that both be done. I don\u2019t want to imagine a world where quiet dominoes are played and a big Joker isn\u2019t treated with the respect it deserves. I know that I\u2019m not alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. A Shortage of Three-Cheese Blend, Mexican-Cheese Blend, Block Cheese and Any Other Cheese and/or Cheese Blends During Thanksgiving\n\nTwo things I must know about you before I can eat your mac and cheese: I will need to see this year\u2019s tax returns, and I will need to know if you think the word \u201cexcessive\u201d exists when making mac and cheese. The first tells me where you are financially and whether you can afford the amount of cheese needed to make a decent mac and cheese, and the second tells me if you are willing to go there.\n\nThere is no such thing as making a \u201ctoo cheesy\u201d mac and cheese. Research shows that the words \u201cThis mac and cheese is OK, but it\u2019s too cheesy\u201d have never been said in the black linguistic lexicon dating back as far as 1842. It\u2019s never happened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn order to make a good mac and cheese for, say, four people, you need at least 35 bags of three-cheese blend and 14 bags of Mexican-cheese blend. Anything less than that and there is a good chance that I will throw your mac and cheese out and talk about you on my Popeyes group chat.", "keywords": ["cheese", "protest", "black", "dont", "things", "number", "love", "macys", "hot", "mac", "know", "sauce"], "polarity": 0.04214015151515154, "subjectivity": 0.46911139455782325},

King was acutely aware that segregation sustains racial inequality in schools and other institutions. Education reform without an explicit attempt to dismantle the sources of inequality isn\u2019t a moon shot toward justice; it is simply a maladjustment to injustice.\n\nA recent Associated Press analysis of national school-enrollment data found that \u201cas of school year 2014-2015, more than 1,000 of the nation\u2019s 6,747 charter schools had minority enrollment of at least 99 percent, and the number has been rising steadily.\u201d\n\nA startling number, but the charter school lobby essentially responded with a version of, \u201cSo what?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAcademics, attorneys and activists can hold any opinion they want about public charter schools and other families\u2019 school choices,\u201d said a spokesperson for the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools in an official response to the AP story. \u201cIn the end, parents\u2019 and students\u2019 opinions are the only ones that matter. And every year, more parents are choosing charter schools.\u201d\n\nNew York magazine columnist Jonathan Chait co-signed that dismissal of segregation with a column that essentially argued it\u2019s not really the job of charter schools to change the system of oppression that created schools that perform poorly, \u201cbecause integrating schools is hard,\u201d and he calls the criticism of increased segregation among charters merely a \u201ctalking point.\u201d For Chait, rising test scores trump segregation concerns.\n\nIn the all-charter district of New Orleans\u2014which Chait described at the 2015 anniversary of Hurricane Katrina as \u201cspectacular\u201d in another defense of charters\u2014virtually no (less than 1 percent) white students attend schools that have earned a D or F performance rating. But 77 percent of white students are enrolled in A- or B-rated schools, according to a new report (pdf) by nonprofit advocacy group Urban League of Louisiana. It is unthinkable that this situation would be tolerated if the students\u2019 races were reversed. It is clear that segregation, and who gets a high-quality choice, matters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn their recent study, \u201cBalancing Act: Schools, Neighborhoods, and Racial Imbalance,\u201d my colleagues at the Brookings Institution\u2014Richard V. Reeves, Nathan Joo and Grover J. \u201cRuss\u201d Whitehurst\u2014compared the racial composition of the country\u2019s public schools with that of the under-18 population of those neighborhoods. They found that schools more or less look like the neighborhoods that host them.\n\n\u201cThe average public school is 2.6 percent less white, 1.8 percent more black, 0.9 percent more Hispanic, and 0.3 percent more Asian than its surrounding neighborhood,\u201d the study found. No surprise there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe segregated state of our schools helps maintain the inequitable funding that determines families\u2019 educational options. When the government-backed Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corp. developed color-coded maps to sort out who could receive mortgage lending, blacks who lived in the red sections of the map were not given loans. And of course, the most well-resourced schools just happen to be located in the most expensive neighborhoods.\n\nThe Brookings team looked closely at district lines, and they found that if you remove them, many schools become more racially imbalanced. It seems to me that wealthy neighborhoods are using district lines to leverage themselves against demographic shifts. According to EdBuild, a nonprofit focused on school-finance issues, the most egregious cases of segregation are shown by the roughly 36 districts that were formed since 2000 as a result of secession\u2014when a school district splits from a larger one.\n\nU.S. News & World Report explained the study\u2019s results: \u201cIn almost all cases, the communities involved were less diverse and had higher property values than those they left behind.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Brookings report found that among the racially imbalanced schools, charters stood out as having a much higher representation of black students. Their imbalance rating is roughly four times that of traditional public schools. (You can see how your school compares through this interactive map.) Charters didn\u2019t cause segregation, but they sure aren\u2019t helping matters.\n\nIn many cases, school district lines are the most potent Confederate monuments that we still need to take down. Proponents of charter schools say that by disrupting school districts that were largely created along discriminatory and segregated lines, charters improve the number of options you have. And sure, giving kids a quality education is an excellent goal. But getting to the source of inequity is real reform.\n\nIn many cases, school district lines are the most potent Confederate monuments that we still need to take down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement in response to the AP story, Shavar Jeffries, national president of Democrats for Education Reform, said sarcastically, \u201cApparently, the school segregation problem boils down to Black and Brown parents choosing schools that aren\u2019t White enough, as if the doors of all-White schools would magically open if only they had the good sense to seek to enroll their children in them.\u201d\n\n\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t conflate insincere calls for diversity (read: making schools whiter) with demands to topple segregated schools. Schools should get the resources they need, whether or not middle-class white students attend them. Our fascination with inclusion is inherently corrupt because it is born of the misconception that whiter schools are better. Jeffries makes this point. But education reform absent an effort to dismantle segregated schools is equally bad. To blame teachers, parents and district bureaucracy (especially when they are black) is to ignore the history of how schools became depressed. To dismiss segregation is to accept structural inequality and the status quo.\n\nWe\u2019ve simply given up on the radical idea of integrating schools. The last major effort occurred in 2007, in the Supreme Court case Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1. The court ruled that Seattle and Louisville, Ky., school districts\u2019 efforts to desegregate/integrate schools by using individuals\u2019 race to place students in schools were unconstitutional. The \u201cdiverse by design\u201d coalition, a group of deliberately integrated schools that poses more of a threat to structural inequality, offers some hope.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe AP study pointed to the right problem with charter schools: an overrepresentation of black and brown students. As the AP report states, \u201c[L]evels of segregation correspond with low achievement levels at schools of all kinds.\u201d What the AP report, Chait and some charter advocates haven\u2019t said is how willing we are to experiment with the lives of black students and black-majority school districts instead of doing the hard work to eradicate the causes of segregation.\n\nMake no mistake: Segregated schools of the past and present are a result of horrible policy choices that most people are willing to accept. There is a reason that after more than 20 years, the research is mixed on charter schools. Schools in black and brown communities were built on broken foundations\u2014e.g., segregation. By not addressing segregation, reformers are turning off the stove when the house is going up in flames.\n\nThis story was produced by the Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education, in partnership with The Root.", "keywords": ["movement", "district", "schools", "black", "school", "report", "charter", "white", "complicit", "segregation", "students", "segregated"], "polarity": 0.0736423974255833, "subjectivity": 0.4108700787904325},

Kennedy was an explosive FBI report about civil rights leader and icon Martin Luther King Jr. Even though the report had nothing to do with the JFK assassination, the Trump administration included the newly unsealed dossier in a trove of documents released Friday related to the Nov. 22, 1963, assassination of Kennedy in Dallas.\n\nWhat is the document?\n\nCommissioned by then-FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, the 20-page report is titled \u201cMartin Luther King, Jr.: A Current Analysis\u201d (pdf). It is dated March 12, 1968\u2014curiously, less than a month before King was shot and killed on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tenn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is in the report?\n\nLies.\n\nThe report is rife with falsehoods, speculation and disproven allegations about King, including his ties to communism and stories about secret orgies with prostitutes and white women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy did they think King was a communist?\n\nBecause ... white people.\n\nYou know how today\u2019s incarnation of suspicious, fragile white-power brokers now label every anti-establishment organization a \u201cterrorist group\u201d? Well, in the 1950s and 1960s, the term \u201ccommunism\u201d shrank the collective Caucasian anus and furrowed white brows with fear, so every group of people who dared to speak truth to power was saddled with the label \u201cMarxist\u201d or \u201ccommunist.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpecifically, the report ties King\u2019s Southern Christian Leadership Conference to the Communist Party USA, a small, marginalized group with no influence by 1960. The details of the document allege that King and the SCLC were heavily influenced by Stanley Levinson, a lawyer and businessman who financed the party for years.\n\nThe dossier tries to tie King to the Communist Party through Levinson even though Levinson had left the party years before he met King. It insists that King\u2019s Poor People\u2019s Campaign was related to a secret communist agenda without offering any solid evidence.\n\nWas King a communist?\n\nDidn\u2019t I just say the report was filled with lies? Are you even paying attention?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of explaining it to you, I\u2019ll just tell you what King told his trusted adviser Bayard Rustin in 1965 as King was crafting a statement announcing the unity of the civil rights organizations:\n\nThere are things I wanted to say renouncing communism in theory, but they would not go along with it. We wanted to say that it was an alien philosophy contrary to us, but they wouldn\u2019t go along with it.\n\nPart of the FBI\u2019s allegations of communism is fueled by King\u2019s stance against the Vietnam War, which some translated as support for the commuinist Viet Cong. Some of it is tied to the fact that King\u2019s Poor People\u2019s Campaign was seen by some melanin-impaired capitalists as un-American. King\u2019s strategy of peaceful resistance is also closely affiliated with Karl Marx\u2019s belief in the possibility of achieving equality through peaceful revolution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is no doubt that there were communists affiliated with the civil rights movement. Some of them were prominent supporters, but that does not mean that King or the entire movement for equality was a communist plot.\n\nSome of the people reading this article hold unspeakably heinous beliefs, like putting sugar on grits. This publication even employs people who commit un-American acts like giving trick-or-treaters candy corn for Halloween or putting ketchup in the refrigerator. Corey Townsend, The Root\u2019s social media editor, even confessed that he likes pumpkin-spice-related foods.\n\nBut none of these terrible acts means that everyone here at The Root is an evil, demented terrorist of taste buds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what about the sex orgies?\n\nJust say \u201corgies\u201d; the \u201csex\u201d part is understood. There aren\u2019t any other kinds of orgies, although I have joined friends at a certain Atlanta restaurant for what can only be described as a \u201clemon-pepper-wing orgy.\u201d\n\nAccording to the analysis from the FBI, King\u2019s associates held a workshop in 1968 in Miami to train a minister. The report states that some in attendance were disgusted with the whiskey drinking, homosexuality and fornication at the conference, including a sex show with prostitutes who engaged in activities \u201cdeviating from the normal sex acts.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe report does not say that King was present at this event but details affairs by King, including one with singer Joan Baez and an alleged love child with the wife of a prominent Los Angeles dentist. The single source for this information is a \u201cresponsible\u201d informant \u201cin a position to know.\u201d\n\nWhy does any of this matter?\n\nAgain, because ... white people.\n\nNone of this salacious detail negates the fact that King was fighting for the freedom or equality of black people. It does not dismiss the reality of Jim Crow, segregation, voter suppression, unequal housing, inferior education, state-sponsored terrorism or the unconstitutional, government-backed treatment of black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only reasonable explanation for any of this is that it was an attempt to discredit MLK and, by proxy, the entire civil rights movement.\n\nHow did they use this information?\n\nHoover and the FBI used it in a number of ways. The FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Program, or COINTELPRO, tried to destroy the civil rights movement for years by casting it as a subversive, communist-backed agenda. The details in this report were ammunition for much of that FBI agenda. In November 1964, the FBI sent a letter to King telling him that it was aware of his extramarital affairs. The bureau threatened to release this information if King didn\u2019t commit suicide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThank God J. Edgar Hoover is gone. Today\u2019s FBI would never do this again, right?\n\nCould you do me a favor and hold my lemon-pepper wing while I double over in laughter?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeff Sessions, the attorney general who controls the FBI, is known for calling the NAACP \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201ccommunist-inspired.\u201d A few months after he took office, an FBI report leaked that characterized the threat from \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d as the new terrorist threat. Even the nonviolent group Black Lives Matter is often called a \u201cterrorist organization\u201d by members on the conservative side of the aisle.\n\nIf you believe that the day has passed when anyone concerned with justice or equality could be painted by right-wing zealots as evil, anti-American villains, just remember to turn on your television around 1 o\u2019clock on a Sunday afternoon and watch the Caucasian crowd members boo NFL players for kneeling quietly during the national anthem, or read one of the many right-wing rags\u2019 desperate attempts to tie former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick to communism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FBI dossier proves that Martin Luther King Jr. was the victim of a coordinated, government-funded effort to suppress the civil rights movement. President Donald Trump\u2019s release of the documents provides additional fuel for those who seek to denigrate anything black and outspoken because their history of complicity gives them the heebie-jeebies. Because they are too willing to believe that a civil rights legend was a communist and sexual deviant, but not that their dear, pumpkin-colored, pussy-grabbing president is a sexual assaulter. Because that would mean that they were on the wrong side of history for more than a quadruple century.\n\n\n\nBecause ... white people.\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["rights", "say", "civil", "communist", "trump", "wanted", "liefilled", "report", "black", "luther", "martin", "released", "jr", "file", "kings", "white", "fbi", "know", "king"], "polarity": -0.02562157287157288, "subjectivity": 0.4564069264069264},

Cole and Walker had only been dead for about two weeks, having been crushed to death by a faulty, outdated garbage truck, but their co-workers felt an ancestral rage that had been building for generations.\n\nMemphis sanitation workers, terrified that any one of them could be next, organized and demanded better safety standards and livable wages; they also demanded that their union, which, in 1964, had been granted charter by the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), finally be recognized.\n\n\n\nThe union had not had much support among the men prior to Cole\u2019s and Walker\u2019s deaths, but it was time. Sanitation workers were sick and tired of being sick and tired. They were angry and motivated to leave the world a better place, a more equitable place, for their children.\n\n\n\nThey were ready.\n\n\n\nOn Feb. 23, after the city of Memphis failed to deliver on its flimsy promises, they knew it was time to march. It was time to march toward a freedom that they could only imagine, but one that they felt in their bones was possible. So, facing violent police officers wielding mace and billy clubs, they marched. They ignored the stares and the slurs, and they marched.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, when black people in the United States organize around liberation, there are white people who view it as radical extremism; it is also viewed by the state as insurrection. Now, envision the deep south in 1968, three years after the ostensible end of Jim Crow.

Loeb served two terms as mayor (1960-1963; 1968-1971) and was open about his abiding love for state\u2019s rights and segregation. He once called for a \u201cwhite unity\u201d ticket in an attempt to suppress the black vote in Memphis. Loeb did not hesitate to sic police officers on sanitation strikers, their families and their supporters\u2014including Gladys Carpenter, a veteran organizer who was present at both the 1965 Selma march and the Meredith March Against Fear. Some marchers suspected that Loeb ordered police officers to bump them with their cars; one of these officers ran over Carpenter\u2019s foot.\n\n\n\nLoeb was on the front line, fighting a war against progress and equity as if his life depended on it. Come hell or high water, they were going to put these \u201cboys\u201d in their places.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn episode 4 of 1300 Men: Memphis Strike \u201968, we take a look at what happened in Memphis when sanitation workers grew tired of fighting for crumbs from the white man\u2019s table\u2014and dying, slowly or quickly, in the process.\n\nFollow @TheRoot and @strikingvoices along with the hashtag #1300Men on Twitter as we begin \u201clive\u201d-tweeting historical moments from the strike starting Feb. 1.\n\n", "keywords": ["workers", "watch", "sick", "strikers", "strike", "sanitation", "officers", "memphis", "men", "white", "tired", "loeb"], "polarity": -0.01156973461321289, "subjectivity": 0.4598757763975156},

New York-based artist Kehinde Wiley \u2014 known for reimagining traditional Western art and putting African Americans both anonymous and famous as the focus \u2014 was selected to bring the former POTUS\u2019 image on to canvas. Baltimore-based artist Amy Sherald brought FLOTUS to life using oil on linen using a more modern touch, using her signature gray palette.\n\nThis moment, with black artists celebrating black accomplishments, was lost on no one, least of all the Obamas, who noted that they were the first in their families to sit for a portrait.\n\n\u201cI am humbled, I am honored, I am proud. I am so incredibly grateful to all the people who came before me in this journey. The folks who built the foundation upon which I stand,\u201d Michelle Obama told the audience who came to celebrate the big moment. \u201cI am also thinking about all the young people, particularly girls and girls of color, who in years ahead will come to this place and they will look up and see an image of someone who looks like them hanging on the wall of this great American institution.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI know the kind of impact that will have on their lives, because I was one of those girls,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd when I think about those future generations and generations past, I think again, wow. What an incredible journey we are on together in this country.\u201d\n\nIn true Michelle Obama fashion, the first lady in her choice of artist, and in her choice of dress, chose to share her spotlight with rising stars. The dress featured in the portrait was designed by Michelle Smith\u2019s label Milly, and even that had extreme significance, with Sherald sharing how the geometric patterns reminded her of the quilts of Gee\u2019s Bend, a small, remote, black community in Alabama known for its quilt masterpieces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former FLOTUS portrait captures her seated, with one hand tucked under her chin as she stares out at those surveying her. Her expression cool, confident, unflinching.\n\n\u201cThe act of Michelle Obama being her authentic self became a profound statement that engaged all of us, because what you represent to this country is an ideal, a human being with integrity, intellect, confidence and compassion,\u201d Sherald, the winner of the 2016 Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition, a rising star in the art world, told the audience.\n\nThe former President, on the other hand, was his usual charming self (please come back) , joking as he surveyed his colorful and vibrant portrait.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cKehinde relative to Amy was working at a disadvantage because his subject was less becoming,\u201d he quipped. \u201cNot as fly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI tried to negotiate less grey hair and Kehinde\u2019s artistic integrity would not allow him to do what I asked.

Hyacinthe is one of the hardest-hustling creatives in New York City, crafting a hybrid career out of her two greatest passions: music and fashion. By day, the stylist and CEO of Immaculate Wardrobe dresses Fortune 500 female power brokers; by night, she\u2019s DJ Soda Pop, spinning hip-hop and house at Manhattan venues like the Museum of Sex\u2014where she launches a weekly residency tonight.\n\nThe Glow Up recently caught up with the busy Bronx-born beauty to discuss her parallel creative careers and her future as a fashion DJ. The product of what she describes as a traditional Haitian-American family, Hyacinthe grew up on a steady diet of hip-hop and haute couture, influenced by three older brothers and a style-obsessed stepsister. Her own obsession with fashion began so early, she recalls cutting out and stashing Vogue spreads under her pillowcase, just so she could wear the outfits in her dreams:\n\nI remember being in school\u2014we had to list our skills, what we were good at. And the only thing I [could] think of was that I can put clothes together nicely. ... And I remember picking up\u2014it was Vibe magazine\u2014and they used to have the fashion editorials, and I saw [celebrity fashion stylist] June Ambrose. And they had this article, and I remember it led with \u201cstyle architect,\u201d and I was just like, \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to do!\u201d She was a major inspiration. ... I just saw her, and I was like, \u201cThis is what I aspire to be.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, it was a mentoring program led by image activist Michaela angela Davis that would be the conduit for bringing Hyacinthe\u2019s aspirations to fruition\u2014and would teach her a powerful lesson in asking for what you want:\n\nIt all starts with Michaela; she was running something called Salon du Shine at her house, where there\u2019d be a group of, like, 10 of us girls [getting] together in her loft in Brooklyn. And we would just talk about stuff, you know. And I remember going up to Michaela, like, \u201cCan you introduce me to June Ambrose?\u201d And she was just like, \u201cI don\u2019t know ... June is super-busy.\u201d I kid you not: A couple of days later, Michaela calls me and she says, \u201cJune is looking for an intern.\u201d... So I went to the interview\u2014June\u2019s two assistants at the time, they tore me to pieces\u2014but I wound up getting the internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile interning for Ambrose, Hyacinthe also worked full time to put herself through the Fashion Merchandising Management program at New York City\u2019s Berkeley College. It was the beginning of a career path that her Haitian parents, unfortunately, didn\u2019t understand:\n\nMy parents\u2014although they were very loving\u2014they didn\u2019t understand the concept of me wanting to be a stylist and me being in a creative field; it was foreign to them. ... They didn\u2019t have the opportunity to dream as we do, and I think because of that, they\u2019re unable to\u2014they\u2019re in a sense blind to that. ... So I wound up having to put myself through college; I worked full time [in retail] and I did this internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorking for Ambrose taught Hyacinthe how the editorials she once obsessed over were created, but it was working in retail that helped her find her niche: helping busy professional women build their wardrobes.\n\nI would work with clients, and they\u2019d be like, \u201cSophia, I love working with you; you style me so well. I wish you could come dress me at home.\u201d And one day I actually got the courage to say, \u201cWell, I can.\u201d ... So this one client took me up on it, and I went to her house and started with her closet. But then she had me speak with her career coach, and that\u2019s when it really clicked: This is on another level. Like, you know, female executives really need this. And I really found the value that I could add.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIdentifying her core clientele and their unique need to possess a high-end wardrobe without having the time to curate or shop for it, Hyacinthe launched her company, Immaculate Wardrobe. The self-described \u201cwardrobe whisperer\u201d currently dresses about 20 clients, all of whom are powerful women who inspire her daily, as she explained:\n\n\n\nI work primarily with female boss bitches. These are women that are working [as] CEOs of companies, and they\u2019re also moms. ... I feel like it\u2019s really important for me to surround myself with these powerful women. And I feel like since they\u2019re at the top of their companies, not only am I empowering them, but also the women that come [into their companies] that\u2019ve just graduated from college ... to see that someone at the top of their career is not only killing it, but also killing it with style.\n\nBut while helping other women fulfill their potential, Hyacinthe also realized an opportunity to further fulfill her own. A longtime avid lover of music, she was often critical of DJs on the New York City nightclub scene. Challenged by an exasperated friend to learn for herself, she accepted his gift of a DJ class at New York\u2019s famed Rock & Soul record store. Instantly, another passion was born, along with an alter ego: DJ Soda Pop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike her styling career, Hyacinthe\u2019s growth as a DJ has been simultaneously organic and self-driven. She initially asked more-established DJs for opening slots and cultivated her own contacts and connections. It\u2019s a path that called into conflict the hip-hop-loving girl from New York\u2019s Bronx borough and the cultured style expert whom elite businesswomen entrust with their wardrobes:\n\n\n\nGrowing up in my family, I grew up listening to Reasonable Doubt, to Onyx, to Nas\u2014like, really hard music. Like, I\u2019m very feminine and girly now, but I grew up liking really hard-core rap. I\u2019ve always known that I\u2019ve had this love and passion for music, but it was, \u201cOK, Sophia, either you can pursue fashion styling or you can be a DJ.\u201d I didn\u2019t think in my mind\u2014I couldn\u2019t fathom the idea of me flourishing in both fields ... [But] to be honest with you, I can\u2019t exist with one without the other. ... I feel like they feed into each other so much, especially the route that I want to go. ... I want to be New York\u2019s new fashion DJ, and there\u2019s not enough of us brown girls up there that are actually doing it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile her dual careers may seem to be a study in contrasts, Hyacinthe approaches both spinning and styling instinctively, using unexpected textural combinations to evoke new feelings. And in the process of embracing her dual passions, her own identity fell into place.\n\nI feel like deejaying has really helped me fully come into my skin. ... Even with race: It\u2019s like before, I thought that I needed to kind of neglect my own identity to be accepted. And I know I\u2019m not the only one that feels that way; as a black woman in the fashion industry, which is predominantly white. I thought that I needed to strip some of my identity\u2014the fact that I listened to hip-hop, the fact that I loved it, the fact that I came from the Bronx\u2014I thought that I almost needed to move away from that in order for me to be seen in society as being this elegant person in fashion ... [but] I feel like once you accept yourself, they have no choice but to accept you for who you are. And I feel like deejaying has really allowed me to accept myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re in the New York City area, you can catch DJ Soda Pop every Thursday night at the Museum of Sex at 233 Fifth Ave. She launches her weekly residency Thursday night with a viewing party for RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race.", "keywords": ["fashion", "wardrobe", "dope", "double", "dj", "inside", "feel", "york", "think", "really", "night", "hyacinthe", "sophia", "career", "women", "dressed", "life"], "polarity": 0.16347579051383396, "subjectivity": 0.5693305335968378},

Cole and Walker had only been dead for about two weeks, having been crushed to death by a faulty, outdated garbage truck, but their co-workers felt an ancestral rage that had been building for generations.\n\nMemphis sanitation workers, terrified that any one of them could be next, organized and demanded better safety standards and livable wages; they also demanded that their union, which, in 1964, had been granted charter by the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), finally be recognized.\n\n\n\nThe union had not had much support among the men prior to Cole\u2019s and Walker\u2019s deaths, but it was time. Sanitation workers were sick and tired of being sick and tired. They were angry and motivated to leave the world a better place, a more equitable place, for their children.\n\n\n\nThey were ready.\n\n\n\nOn Feb. 23, after the city of Memphis failed to deliver on its flimsy promises, they knew it was time to march. It was time to march toward a freedom that they could only imagine, but one that they felt in their bones was possible. So, facing violent police officers wielding mace and billy clubs, they marched. They ignored the stares and the slurs, and they marched.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, when black people in the United States organize around liberation, there are white people who view it as radical extremism; it is also viewed by the state as insurrection. Now, envision the deep south in 1968, three years after the ostensible end of Jim Crow. White people in Memphis were convinced that the sanitation strikers needed to be broken if they couldn\u2019t be grateful for their jobs.\n\nAs shown in \u201cThe Sharecroppers,\u201d episode 3 of 1300 Men: Memphis Strike \u201968, many of the strikers had migrated from rural Mississippi and, for them, Henry Loeb was nothing more than a citified plantation boss. Loeb served two terms as mayor (1960-1963; 1968-1971) and was open about his abiding love for state\u2019s rights and segregation. He once called for a \u201cwhite unity\u201d ticket in an attempt to suppress the black vote in Memphis. Loeb did not hesitate to sic police officers on sanitation strikers, their families and their supporters\u2014including Gladys Carpenter, a veteran organizer who was present at both the 1965 Selma march and the Meredith March Against Fear. Some marchers suspected that Loeb ordered police officers to bump them with their cars; one of these officers ran over Carpenter\u2019s foot.\n\n\n\nLoeb was on the front line, fighting a war against progress and equity as if his life depended on it. Come hell or high water, they were going to put these \u201cboys\u201d in their places.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn episode 4 of 1300 Men: Memphis Strike \u201968, we take a look at what happened in Memphis when sanitation workers grew tired of fighting for crumbs from the white man\u2019s table\u2014and dying, slowly or quickly, in the process.\n\nFollow @TheRoot and @strikingvoices along with the hashtag #1300Men on Twitter as we begin \u201clive\u201d-tweeting historical moments from the strike starting Feb. 1.\n\n", "keywords": ["workers", "watch", "sick", "strikers", "strike", "sanitation", "officers", "memphis", "men", "white", "tired", "loeb"], "polarity": -0.01156973461321289, "subjectivity": 0.4598757763975156},

Designer Brandon Maxwell\u2019s newly launched Spring/Summer 2018 advertising campaign, starring British model Jourdan Dunn and her surprise date, is a follow-up to his two previous and equally stunning campaign videos featuring models Riley Montana and Joan Smalls.\n\nGorgeous clothes, perfect bodies and pretty faces are the least of what we\u2019re treated to in Maxwell\u2019s videos, written and directed by the designer himself in collaboration with his longtime creative partner, Jessy Price. Each is striking in its intimacy as Maxwell unzips the model mystique, allowing us to peer into the souls of the women he loves to dress.\n\nFashion has a fairy-tale quality to it, and it\u2019s an element illustrated by Maxwell\u2019s clothes juxtaposed against the backdrop of his models\u2019 everyday lives. In his most recent campaign, Dunn gets confessional about her own transformative journey into modeling and motherhood, both while she was still a teenager. Dunn\u2019s life as a mother lies at the center of her video, filmed with her own tiny Prince Charming, 8-year-old son Riley.\n\nIt\u2019s a pure fantasy of a mother-son scenario, but nonetheless one that speaks to the dream of how we all like to think of those magical days of childhood, a time when seeing your mother happy, dressed up and looking lovely\u2014along with an extra ride on the carousel and a second ice cream\u2014was, in fact, real magic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up caught up with Maxwell via Instagram while he was burning the midnight oil, creating his next collection\u2014only two weeks away from being presented at New York Fashion Week. For him, Dunn\u2019s campaign video expresses something very special:\n\nIt\u2019s not about who you are, nor how much you can provide for your child; it\u2019s about the relationship, the act of doing something together, the love of a mother and the safety you feel when she says to you through action, \u201cYou matter, I see you, and I love you, right where you are.\u201d\n\nIn Maxwell\u2019s Fall/Winter 2017 campaign video, superstrong Puerto Rican model Joan Smalls celebrated her career and craft. She tells us not so much about herself, but reminds us that we should not forget the humanity of people, no matter the package in which they come\u2014glamorous or otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrenched in sunlight, wearing a cocktail dress, Smalls displays the discipline of a soldier as a team of tailors pins the little black dress to fit Smalls\u2019 tight curves while she stands stock-still. Then she elegantly bursts to life, strutting across the floor and instantly giving us an inside look at the role models play in making runway creations a reality. In a quote from the company\u2019s website, Maxwell describes the feeling of Smalls\u2019 shoot:\n\nI wanted to capture the collection the way that I see it during fittings and during the creation process. It helps to better explain why I create the clothes that I do, which are meant to enhance a woman\u2019s personality, goals, talents and desires\u2014never to outshine her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDetroit-born Ebony Riley\u2014now better known as Riley Montana\u2014came to the model game late, after completing her nursing degree. Despite the fact that models age in dog years, Riley broke out of the pack and became a star with the love and support of designers like Riccardo Tisci, Tom Ford and, most of all, Brandon Maxwell, whom she refers to fondly as her \u201cfather.\u201d\n\nMaxwell\u2019s video portrait of Riley explores her cosmic destiny in down-to-earth terms, from her beginnings in Detroit to \u201c a new reality.\u201d That reality is the fashion business, where she was asked to become another version of herself; \u201cone that was more relatable and that didn\u2019t offend.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRiley, a foster child, takes us into the place she calls \u201chome,\u201d proudly showing every intimate, unidealized and precious detail of a family life full of warmth and love, in stark contrast with the devastated urban landscape that lies outside the family\u2019s door. In Riley\u2019s words, all of these were things \u201cthat I was once [was] taught to hide\u2014but they make me who I am.\u201d\n\nIn this urban fashion fairy tale, Cinderella rescues herself, embracing the struggle to excel while not assimilating. Maxwell says:\n\nI\u2019ve spent so much time with Riley, and we talked about our lives and similarities. I realized that she\u2019s the embodiment of the woman I design for. The woman who, no matter what she\u2019s been through, puts on the clothes with her head held high.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat beautiful black girls might we expect to see high-stepping on Brandon Maxwell\u2019s runway this season?\n\n\u201cWe are still in the process of casting, so no spoilers!\u201d he says. \u201cEach season, we prioritize diversity in our runway casting and do our best to represent the Brandon Maxwell woman: strong, sophisticated and confident.\u201d\n\nYou can trust that The Glow Up will be there to see our beautiful queens serve the people in the next chapter of his fashion fairy tale.", "keywords": ["fashion", "campaign", "riley", "maxwells", "models", "model", "video", "love", "charm", "designer", "times", "brandon", "blackgirlmagic", "believes", "maxwell", "smalls", "3rd"], "polarity": 0.27941388373531234, "subjectivity": 0.556208410636982},

Kelly\u2014specifically, the support of him, the defense of him and the wagons circling around him\u2014from most other notable moral quandaries is the lack of any sort of reasonable justification for any continued Kelly-centric advocacy or patronage. For instance, it\u2019s no secret now that Chick-fil-A has donated considerable resources to fight against marriage equality. But when you actually walk past a Chick-fil-A in a mall food court, and you\u2019re greeted by the preternaturally peppy and kind cashiers and managers (some of whom might be gay or trans themselves), perhaps you can talk yourself into a Smokehouse BBQ Bacon Sandwich. This doesn\u2019t make that decision right. But a reasonable justification does exist.\n\nThere are no such excuses with R. Kelly\u2014no opportunities to forget that he is exactly who he is. His alleged criminality and sexual deviance have been corroborated by numerous people\u2014including men and women who\u2019ve lived in Chicago and have either witnessed Kelly stalking and preying on high-school-age girls or have actually been one of the young girls who caught his eye. Jim DeRogatis has made it his personal mission to descend as far down the R. Kelly rabbit hole as he can go, unlocking new terrors with each stage:\n\nOver the next seven months, Pace says she had sex with Kelly repeatedly, a claim she would later repeat during her settlement process. Without asking her permission, Kelly filmed most of the encounters on his iPhone or a video camera on a tripod, Pace says and a settlement draft reiterates. \u201cI had to call him \u2018daddy,\u2019 and he would call me \u2018baby.\u2019 He wanted me to have two pigtails, and I had to go out and find little schoolgirl outfits.\u201d If Kelly was previously unaware of Pace\u2019s age, she says she told him for certain that she was 16 on July 17, 2009, a claim she also made in the aforementioned documents. \u201cI gave him my state ID,\u201d she says. She recalls that Kelly told her things were fine, but that she should tell anyone who asked that she was 19, and act like she was 25. Pace says that she started spending weekends with Kelly at his Olympia Fields home. While she was in the mansion, she says, she had to follow Kelly\u2019s \u201crules,\u201d which included dressing in baggy clothes, turning over her phone, and asking permission to shower, eat, go to the bathroom, and leave the property. If she broke the rules, she says, she was mentally and physically abused. \u201cAt the time, I didn\u2019t know what I liked, honestly,\u201d Pace says, explaining why she complied. \u201cI just knew that I liked his music, so I was pretty much accepting of anything that came with him at the time.\u201d\n\nAlthough the name \u201cJerhonda Pace\u201d might be new, nothing she\u2019s saying about R. Kelly is particularly novel. And I\u2019m sure most of those who\u2019ve defended him and defended their continued fandom before will continue to. Because \u201cthose girls were fast.\u201d And also because of the distinction between R. Kelly the man and R. Kelly the artist.\n\nSeveral people, including DeRogatis, have written and commented on the abject wrongness of believing those girls \u201cknew what they were doing,\u201d and what the continued cultural embrace and patronage of R. Kelly says about our feelings about black women and girls, and whether we collectively believe they deserve protection and care. (We don\u2019t.)\n\nBut some of those who believe in the separation between the art and the man are still able to possess a convenient level of cognitive dissonance, allowing them to distill the musical parts of him away from his madness. But that doesn\u2019t exist, either. The separation between the two is mythical: a fabrication invented by those who wish to pretend that R. Kelly\u2019s musical catalog isn\u2019t also filled with both reminders and taunts of his alleged sex crimes. The title of the hit he wrote for Aaliyah\u2014his eventual teenage wife\u2014was \u201cAge Ain\u2019t Nothing but a Number.\u201d His studio is named the Chocolate Factory.

Although the first voice you hear is from a white man, the first face you see is Chadwick Boseman\u2019s King T\u2019Challa with an expression saying, \u201cWhy the fuck is this white man talking? DOES HE NOT KNOW THAT THIS IS THE TRAILER FOR THE BLACK PANTHER MOVIE, NOT THE \u2018WHITE MAN SAYS WORDS THAT VAGUELY MATTER TO PEOPLE\u2019 MOVIE?\u201d\n\n3.

Everything is about to change\u2014or so it seems\u2014as designers present fashion shows featuring clothes generally intended to break the rules. But one thing rarely, if ever, seems to change, and that\u2019s the absence of black designers occupying top spots in the fashion industry.\n\nFreelance designer and journalist Kibwe Chase-Marshall recently published an op-ed in Business of Fashion\u2014one of the most respected media outlets for fashion-industry reporting\u2014titled, \u201cWhy Aren\u2019t There More Black Designers?\u201d It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve asked myself nearly every time I\u2019ve gone into work over my 30-year career in fashion. Why?\n\nAll too often, I\u2019m the only person of color on set doing any job. The rare exception is on the catwalk, where the sheer number of people required to produce a fashion show calls for hiring more than one black person, simply by default. But when the final bow is taken, it is almost never a black designer who has the chance to receive either kudos or a career-ending critique from the press.\n\nChase-Marshall\u2014who worked in high-level but never top-tier jobs, such as vice president or head designer, for firms like Michael Kors, Isaac Mizrahi and Oscar de la Renta\u2014found himself repeatedly slamming up against a glass ceiling. And now he\u2019s breaking that glass ceiling by breaking the silence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Jan. 3, an action-oriented social media campaign, #BreakSilenceBreakCeilings, went live. The campaign was conceived by Chase-Marshall and aimed at breaking the unwritten and unspoken rule of discriminatory hiring practices in fashion, an industry that Chase-Marshall says does not have a \u201cdiversity problem\u201d but, rather, a \u201cblack-people problem.\u201d\n\nHimself a talented technical draftsman, stylist and cutter, Chase-Marshall is not content to simply illustrate the talent of black designers as a solution to the problem. In February, I was on a steering committee for the Black Designers Exhibition and Symposium at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, which shed light on the fierce beauty of too-little-seen talent and started the conversation as to why\u2014but did not offer us a plan to advance the battle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChase-Marshall has tailored a solution to fit the problem, noting in his op-ed, \u201cFed up with watching this most blatant form of discrimination thrive, while the broader industry capitalizes on Black celebrity associations and the recent uptick in Black casting, I decided to do something.\u201d\n\nChase-Marshall, who stopped working full time in design studios in 2010 after 13 years, now makes a living as a freelance designer and writer for publications like Elle. He has devised a plan of action for the Council of Fashion Designers of America and Vogue, which collaborate on the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund, the most powerful entity in the American\u2014if not global\u2014luxury-garment industry, which has promoted some of the most successful black designers in recent memory, such as Tracy Reese and Cushnie and Ochs.\n\nChase-Marshall would like to see CFDA/Vogue adopt a program with greater oversight of its design-industry members, such as offering immersive training for hiring managers in elimination of bias, along with CFDA/Vogue\u2019s annual disclosure and endorsement of participating brands, along with annual statistics regarding the racial composition of their design teams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s what the industry can do, but to consumers who want to take a stand against inequality and appropriation, Chase-Marshall posted:\n\nLet\u2019s do something: If you agree that it\u2019s time for the community of fashion design professionals to be taken to task regarding employment/advancement discrimination against qualified black candidates, along with liking this post, comment #breaksilencebreakceilings and tag @CFDA, @Voguemagazine, @Bof, @nytimes, and @wwd below. In addition, forward this post to 5 friends (or more) that you feel care to affect overdue change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlackness, until very recently, was seen as an unmarketable quality,\u201d says Chase-Marshall, who hails from Trinidad, was raised in Washington, D.C., and was a classmate of the Clinton and Gore children. But despite having the clubby connections to wealth and power that headhunters prize for their potential to move the needle when it comes to selling expensive designer clothing, he was discounted, simply because of the color of his skin.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if someone is racist,\u201d Chase-Marshall says. \u201cI care if people use discriminatory hiring practices.\u201d His is neither a call for affirmative action nor a call for quotas\u2014which can undercut recognition of real talent\u2014but, rather, a call for education transparency and accountability that can create lasting change within the fashion industry.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m proud of Chase-Marshall for pushing us beyond merely saying that we have the right to more than just exist and be seen in the fashion industry. It\u2019s our responsibility to demand, not only of fashion but also of our trendsetting selves, that our spending be reflected in the identities of the images marketed to us, as well as that our dollars come back into our communities through the black talent being paid and promoted according to their true worth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInspired by Muhammad Ali and Colin Kaepernick, Chase-Marshall, who currently engages in every type of freelance work, from designing pull-up diapers to diamond rings, wants to be the kind of person who \u201cprioritizes their integrity over their paycheck.\u201d He broke his silence \u201cbecause you can\u2019t continue to play a losing game.\u201d Now it\u2019s time for the powerful consumers black women are to suit up and make the fashion industry play ball.", "keywords": ["hiring", "missing", "black", "action", "designers", "chasemarshall", "simply", "industry", "designer", "problem", "fashion", "talent"], "polarity": 0.12858133650387174, "subjectivity": 0.4944134503993659},

Johnson met Kelly while on daily watch outside his child-pornography trial in 2008.\n\nIn a new report for BuzzFeed News, Jim DeRogatis interviewed Pace about claims that she received \u201ccash settlements from the star in return for signing nondisclosure agreements.\u201d\n\n\n\nNow known as Jerhonda Pace, the 24-year-old is a mother of three children and is speaking out and violating her nondisclosure agreement in order to help other women and girls who might be in the same situation she says she was in as a teen.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have anybody to speak up on my behalf when I was going through what I was going through with him. He\u2019s brainwashed them really bad, and it kind of reminds me of Charles Manson,\u201d Pace said of the singer.\n\nIn 2008, Pace said, she lied to court officials about her age in order to gain access to the trial, because at the time, she was under 18. Pace said she would cut class just to get a glimpse of Kelly. A year later, Pace, who was then 16, alleges that she received a message on Facebook from an associate of Kelly\u2019s and she was invited to his Chicago mansion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the age of 16, Pace alleges, she engaged in oral sex with Kelly, and claims the singer ensured that she wouldn\u2019t speak about their sexual activity by having her write and sign letters stating that she stole from him and that her parents were blackmailing him, which she now says were lies.\n\nPace told BuzzFeed that Kelly was strict with rules in his home. She says she was only allowed to wear baggy clothes and couldn\u2019t use a phone. She also had to ask when to shower, eat and use the bathroom. If the rules were broken, Pace alleges, Kelly would physically and mentally abuse her.\n\nOn June 9, 2009, Pace alleges, Kelly gave her alcohol, and the two of them had intercourse. A month later, she says she told Kelly her true age, which she says he was fine with. The sex continued for months, says Pace, who alleges that Kelly filmed the encounters without her permission.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2010, Pace\u2019s \u201crelationship\u201d with Kelly ended after she says he caught her texting a friend and attacked her, BuzzFeed reports. Pace then contacted Susan E. Loggans, an attorney who was known for getting cash settlements for other women who had accused Kelly of similar acts of sexual abuse and battery.\n\nPace passed the lie detector tests given to her by Loggans, who eventually secured a large settlement within weeks of her taking on the case, BuzzFeed reports. In return for the settlement, Pace signed a nondisclosure agreement, which stated that she would not discuss the case or pursue any further accusations against Kelly. But all of that changed after Pace learned of other women who allegedly are still being abused by Kelly in his \u201ccult,\u201d according to the report.\n\nKelly yet again denies these accusations, just as he did previous ones from earlier this summer, which were also brought to light by writer DeRogatis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe allegations against Mr. Kelly are false, and are being made by individuals known to be dishonest. It is clear these continuing stories are the result of the effort of those with personal agendas who are working in concert to interfere with and damage his career.

Cole and Walker had only been dead for about two weeks, having been crushed to death by a faulty, outdated garbage truck, but their co-workers felt an ancestral rage that had been building for generations.\n\nMemphis sanitation workers, terrified that any one of them could be next, organized and demanded better safety standards and livable wages; they also demanded that their union, which, in 1964, had been granted charter by the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), finally be recognized.\n\n\n\nThe union had not had much support among the men prior to Cole\u2019s and Walker\u2019s deaths, but it was time. Sanitation workers were sick and tired of being sick and tired. They were angry and motivated to leave the world a better place, a more equitable place, for their children.\n\n\n\nThey were ready.\n\n\n\nOn Feb. 23, after the city of Memphis failed to deliver on its flimsy promises, they knew it was time to march. It was time to march toward a freedom that they could only imagine, but one that they felt in their bones was possible. So, facing violent police officers wielding mace and billy clubs, they marched. They ignored the stares and the slurs, and they marched.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, when black people in the United States organize around liberation, there are white people who view it as radical extremism; it is also viewed by the state as insurrection. Now, envision the deep south in 1968, three years after the ostensible end of Jim Crow. White people in Memphis were convinced that the sanitation strikers needed to be broken if they couldn\u2019t be grateful for their jobs.\n\nAs shown in \u201cThe Sharecroppers,\u201d episode 3 of 1300 Men: Memphis Strike \u201968, many of the strikers had migrated from rural Mississippi and, for them, Henry Loeb was nothing more than a citified plantation boss. Loeb served two terms as mayor (1960-1963; 1968-1971) and was open about his abiding love for state\u2019s rights and segregation. He once called for a \u201cwhite unity\u201d ticket in an attempt to suppress the black vote in Memphis. Loeb did not hesitate to sic police officers on sanitation strikers, their families and their supporters\u2014including Gladys Carpenter, a veteran organizer who was present at both the 1965 Selma march and the Meredith March Against Fear. Some marchers suspected that Loeb ordered police officers to bump them with their cars; one of these officers ran over Carpenter\u2019s foot.\n\n\n\nLoeb was on the front line, fighting a war against progress and equity as if his life depended on it. Come hell or high water, they were going to put these \u201cboys\u201d in their places.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn episode 4 of 1300 Men: Memphis Strike \u201968, we take a look at what happened in Memphis when sanitation workers grew tired of fighting for crumbs from the white man\u2019s table\u2014and dying, slowly or quickly, in the process.\n\nFollow @TheRoot and @strikingvoices along with the hashtag #1300Men on Twitter as we begin \u201clive\u201d-tweeting historical moments from the strike starting Feb. 1.\n\n", "keywords": ["workers", "watch", "sick", "strikers", "strike", "sanitation", "officers", "memphis", "men", "white", "tired", "loeb"], "polarity": -0.01156973461321289, "subjectivity": 0.4598757763975156},

The portraits, by Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald respectively\u2014both black painters\u2014are such sharp departures from any previous depictions of a president and first lady that reviews were understandably mixed, even amongst our own crew here at The Root (including yours truly).\n\n\n\nEspecially when considering Mrs. Obama\u2019s portrait, it took a moment to reconcile her portrayal with our expectations. Where was the warmth we\u2019d become so accustomed to during the Obama era? The radiant smile? The glorious brown skin?\n\nWhile Wiley\u2019s portrait of our 44th President\u2019s portrait seemed lush and even playful\u2014if whimsically unconventional for a leader of the free world\u2014Sherald\u2019s portrait of his wife, posed similarly to Rodin\u2019s The Thinker, seemed to almost recede by comparison, like a cherished photograph that had already faded much too soon for our comfort. To some of us, it seemed more like a suggestion of our favorite first lady, rather than a portrait of the lady herself.\n\nAnd yet, in the days since\u2014for this writer, at least\u2014it has been difficult not to return to look at it again and again.\n\nAs Doreen St. Felix wrote in a wonderful analysis for the New Yorker:\n\nThe racializing schema of Sherald\u2019s work is to \u2018exclude the idea of color as race,\u2019 she has said, in her artist\u2019s statement. To Sherald, the photorealistic depiction of race\u2014a quality determined by others\u2019 eyes, externally\u2014is a dead end. Applied to Michelle Obama, the lack of brown in the skin feels first like a loss, and then like a real gain. This is a different Michelle, a woman evacuated of celebrity, who appears provisionally dreamlike, nearly a shadow. The mouth and the eyes and the strong arms that we know are present, but fainter. From some distance, I can imagine, the figure might not be immediately recognizable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf the many things that have been written about Mrs. Obama\u2019s portrait since its unveiling last Monday, several articles have focused on the dress she chose to be immortalized in, made by American (semi)affordable luxury label Milly, designed by Michelle Smith. Indeed, it is the most visually striking element of the portrait, featuring graphic-patterned patches in black, red, yellow, pink and beige, scattered across the white foreground of the skirt. It drapes across Mrs. Obama\u2019s lap in much the same way I remember quilts draping across my Mississippian great-grandmother\u2019s lap decades ago.\n\nMany have been quick to make the same comparison, especially noting similarities between Mrs. Obama\u2019s dress and the famously graphic geometric quilts created for over a century in Gee\u2019s Bend, Alabama. At the unveiling, artist Amy Sherald spoke to the similarities herself, saying:\n\nThe dress chosen for this painting was designed by Milly. It has an abstract pattern that reminded me of the Dutch artist Piet Mondrian\u2019s geometric paintings. But Milly\u2019s design also resembles the inspired quilt masterpieces made by the women of Gee\u2019s Bend, a small remote black community in Alabama where they compose quilts in geometries that transform clothes and fabric remnants into masterpieces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut designer Smith apparently had no such correlation in mind when she created the print. She spoke to Vogue about the dress, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s made of a stretch cotton poplin print in a clean, minimal, geometric print without a reference to anything past or nostalgic, which gives the dress a very forward-thinking sensibility\u2014this is very Michelle Obama.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut while Michelle Smith may not have read a metaphor for quilting in her own work, is it safe for her to assume that a woman as aware and astute as Michelle Obama\u2014well known for her strategic sartorial statements\u2014didn\u2019t? Aside from evoking the great American southern tradition of quilting\u2014as well as the stars and stripes famously handsewn for this country\u2014is it so outlandish to consider that her gown might also evoke the racial patchwork that comprises the country her husband so recently led?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo glean more insight, The Glow Up spoke with textile artist, clothing designer, children\u2019s book author and illustrator, and master quilter Cozbi Cabrera, a 2017 Lincoln Center artist-in-residence whose own quilts have been shown in the Myrtle Beach Art Museum, concurrent with an exhibit on the quilters of Gee\u2019s Bend. Like many others, she isn\u2019t so quick to discredit the correlation between the white American designer dress and the black American South.\n\nWell, I think for starters that designers have to be aware that they are influenced greatly, and that fashion overall is derivative. So, whether we are doing it consciously or subconsciously, there is something about putting all of these elements together that\u2019s going to strike a chord or trigger a memory or something. So, I think that she\u2019s probably not being\u2014I wouldn\u2019t even use the word \u2018truthful\u2019\u2014I think that she\u2019s probably not being aware of this idea that fashion is derivative. So, it comes from somewhere. And I think that rightfully so, [Amy Sherald\u2019s] notion of her choice is very telling as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCabrera is also quick to note the very \u201cAmerican story\u201d of Gee\u2019s Bend, an isolated peninsula about 35 miles southwest of Selma, Alabama, with a population of less than 300, according to the 2010 Census. Primarily African-American and reachable almost exclusively by ferry, in 1965, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. visited the enclave three weeks before Selma\u2019s \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d to encourage voter registration. However, three years before, Alabama\u2019s government had shut down ferry service to nearby Camden, further isolating the community from basic necessities like medical attention, employment, and participation in the democratic process.\n\nAnd yet, even in isolation, their traditions continued. In 2002, the Whitney Museum in New York mounted a show of the quilts of Gee\u2019s Bend, to rave reviews. The New York Times\u2019 art critic called them \u201ceye-poppingly gorgeous,\u201d while others marveled at the fact that these modernist creations could have generated within a place seemingly cut off from inspiration, as Cabrera notes:\n\n[T]heir quilts showed up at the Whitney Museum in New York, and the reviews came back that what they were doing rivaled anything that you\u2019d find in 20th-century art. ... how could it be? How could they have these sophisticated influences if they were in isolation? And it\u2019s almost like an assumption that the creator\u2014or what I would call the Divine\u2014sort of sprinkles sophistication and aesthetic instincts only on a particular group of people, in only a particular geographic location, you know?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilarly, Cabrera believes it may be short-sighted to underestimate the deep significance and skill in Sherald\u2019s portrait of Michelle Obama\u2014or to assume the former First Lady\u2019s intentions in choosing her for the commission. Because ultimately, isn\u2019t art\u2014like beauty\u2014in the eye of the beholder?\n\nI think that in a less masterful hand, most people have a tendency to kind of throw in the kitchen sink, and in my mind, [Sherald] made some very deliberate choices as to what to leave out and what was left was the likeness of Michelle Obama. So we got that it was her\u2014you know it was quite a bit of fluidity of line, and then these elements of patch. All that\u2019s left in my mind visually were the essentials to kind of like, tell the story. How [Milly designer Michelle Smith] might feel about that, I think it\u2019s almost not even relevant because I think that the larger community got what was being communicated. And so, I think that\u2019s why you keep hearing, again and again, this notion of [the] quilt. I think that there\u2019s a language that we all understand, and that\u2019s what you get with people groups; like the things that don\u2019t have to be spoken but are understood. ... It\u2019s not uncanny that the community is saying similar things along a similar vein, because we do have this common understanding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those of us whom, at first glance, might have wanted something more colorful and dramatic from our first black First Lady, perhaps it\u2019s worth taking a beat, and considering who Michelle Obama really is, as Cabrera\u2019s deft analysis reminds us:\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s the visual equivalent of a stage whisper, which draws more attention to itself.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["portrait", "dress", "black", "included", "bend", "picture", "gees", "quilts", "michelle", "lady", "obama", "think"], "polarity": 0.147996758631087, "subjectivity": 0.42747813960500525},

After she advocated for herself and insisted on a CT scan and a blood thinner, another emergency surgery was performed to insert a filter into a major vein to clear up abdominal bleeding (a side effect of blood-thinning medication). To add to the drama, her C-section incision then ruptured because of the intense coughing caused by the blood clot. Our mighty Serena was left flat on her back for a full six weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThankfully, mother and daughter are now more than fine.

Not by a long shot. Twenty-three grand slams already have her name on them, and she\u2019s looking to own 25 in total, making her the greatest tennis player of all time (24 is the current record held by Australian Margaret Court).\n\nAs for motherhood, Williams only believes it ups her game, telling Vogue:\n\nKnowing I\u2019ve got this beautiful baby to go home to makes me feel like I don\u2019t have to play another match.

G. Taylor Spink Award, given to her for meritorious contributions to baseball writing. She is the 68th recipient of the award from the Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America, and the first female honoree \u2014 a formal acknowledgment that men do not own exclusive rights to the most powerful written words.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018I humbly stand on stage for those who were stung by racism or sexism or any other insidious bias and persevered,\u2019 Smith said. \u2018You are unbreakable. You make me proud.\u2019\n\n\u201cSmith, 64, spent more than three decades as a newspaper reporter and columnist, including a significant stint as a national baseball writer and columnist for The New York Times from 1991 to 1998. During that period, she wrote about the near death and rebirth of the sport \u2014 from the destructive strike that wiped out the 1994 season to the dawning of a new Yankees dynasty at the end of the decade. She later moved home to work for the Philadelphia Inquirer and became a news editor for ESPN in 2007.\n\n\u201cIt was before that, during her years with The Hartford Courant as a pioneering, full-time female baseball beat writer covering the Yankees, that Smith met the most resistance from players and officials.

Lack set out to abandon most of the channel\u2019s low-rated opinion-based programming and install in its place news-heavy programs that would make MSNBC more like the channel\u2019s sister site, NBC News. (Stephens, like some of the other recent hires, contributes to both.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the election of Donald Trump has complicated that evolution, raising the profile and popularity of MSNBC\u2019s liberal hosts just as Lack sought to dial back the network\u2019s liberal identity. . . .\u201d\n\nSutton also wrote, \u201cWhat has stung the most to some people hasn\u2019t simply been the hires of ex-Fox talent or outspoken conservatives, but the fact that the hires have seemed to replace many of the network\u2019s hosts of color. Since Lack\u2019s return to MSNBC, according to HuffPost, at least nine contributors and show hosts of color have departed the channel. The loss of several familiar faces of color has been particularly stark against the backdrop of the new hires, many of whom are white.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cConcerns about diversity have been amplified in part by a series of contentious departures that have played out in the press. In February 2016, progressive weekend host Melissa Harris-Perry, who is black, refused to appear on her show, publicly alleging that the network was trying to usurp her 4-year-old program and dictate her editorial choices. She was fired, prompting discussion over whether MSNBC remained committed to the diverse opinions and guests that Harris-Perry\u2019s show had prioritized.\n\n\u201cThe conversation arose again when anchor Jose Diaz-Balart was regularly preempted for election coverage. (Diaz-Balart, who is Cuban-American, is no longer an MSNBC host, but he remains a host on NBCUniversal\u2019s Telemundo and on NBC News.) And it reached a fever pitch in January following the abrupt departure of NBC News and MSNBC host Tamron Hall, who reportedly decided to leave the network after discovering she would lose her Today show hour to [Megyn] Kelly.\n\n\u201cNo one Mic spoke to believed Lack intentionally targeted hosts of color, but four MSNBC insiders said they do not believe Lack actively prioritizes on-screen diversity. The loss of diverse hosts, then, is more of an unintended consequence of the long-term reinvention of the channel. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cTVNewser has learned that Raelyn Johnson has been promoted to executive producer, MSNBC Weekends,\u201d A.J.

Kelly Story\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCall it the Gawker Effect,\u201d Margaret Sullivan wrote Sunday in the Washington Post.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter Jim DeRogatis, the veteran Chicago rock critic, reported for months on a stunning story about R&B singer R. Kelly and the young women said to be under his psychological and sexual control, it came time to get it published.\n\n\u201cThree separate media organizations were interested but got cold feet at the last minute, DeRogatis said. Each one, after investing months of work, backed away from the story that used named sources and documents to describe how women near Atlanta and Chicago were held as if in a cult, according to what parents and others had told police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(DeRogatis declined to name the news organizations because of his appreciation of the editors he worked with; they weren\u2019t the ones who pulled the plug. They include a regional print publication, a world-famous multimedia behemoth and a radio-based digital outlet.)\n\n\u201c \u2018Gawker came up in a lot of those conversations,\u2019 DeRogatis said, referring to the snarky and risk-taking website that was put out of business last summer after a lawsuit brought by Terry Bollea, also known as Hulk Hogan. The invasion-of-privacy suit was bankrolled by billionaire Peter Thiel, a confidant of President Trump.\n\n\u201c \u2018Nobody wanted to take that risk.\u2019\n\n\u201cDeRogatis has pursued the R. Kelly story doggedly, first writing about it well over a decade ago and taking the Fifth Amendment in a subsequent trial rather than reveal his sources. (The longtime rock critic for the Chicago Sun-Times, DeRogatis also had a brief stint with Rolling Stone magazine; he was famously fired after he complained publicly that publisher Jann Wenner had killed his pan of a Hootie and the Blowfish album.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018This is a tawdry, sickening tale,\u2019 he told me. In an interview with Vox, he described the \u2018rape culture\u2019 he believes is the underlying story.\n\n\u201cUltimately, DeRogatis turned to a fourth outlet, BuzzFeed, which published the jaw-dropping story this month under the headline \u2018Inside the Pied Piper of R&B\u2019s \u201cCult.\u201d \u2018\n\n\u201c \u2018When we pursue a story, our primary concern is whether it\u2019s accurate and newsworthy \u2014 not whether the subject is too rich or powerful, be it Russian oligarchs, R. Kelly or the Trump White House,\u2019 said BuzzFeed spokesman Matt Mittenthal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not just a question of having what DeRogatis calls \u2018major cojones.\u2019 BuzzFeed\u2019s lawyers managed to make the story bulletproof, or apparently so, since there has been no challenge to its facts, not even a request for a minor correction. (Kelly has publicly insisted that there\u2019s no truth that he runs a cult or anything like it.)\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty and fear out there, post-Gawker, said Nabiha Syed, BuzzFeed\u2019s assistant general counsel, who vetted the story before publication. . . .\u201d\n\nTMZ: R.

Sanitation Department. They left their families for a long day of collecting garbage with the full expectation of returning home to them. Instead, as their shifts were about to end and heavy rain poured down around them, the two men were crushed to death in the barrel of a faulty garbage truck.\n\nTheir deaths sparked a revolution that would forever change the trajectory of the civil rights movement. But that day, they were just two men, working through the indignity of starvation wages and torturous working conditions to support their families.\n\nThe truck in which Walker and Cole were killed was one of the six remaining antiquated garbage trucks that were in the process of being phased out of the Sanitation Department\u2019s fleet. The two men were seeking shelter from the rain by standing in the barrel of the truck, where the garbage is pushed to the rear, as the driver and two co-workers rode in the front.\n\n\n\nThen the unimaginable happened.\n\nAt around 4:20 p.m., as the men finished their shift in the predominantly white neighborhood of East Memphis, on the way back to the city dump, somehow the garbage-compression piston on the outdated, faulty truck was triggered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe motor started racing and the driver stopped and ran around and smashed that button to stop that thing,\u201d co-worker Elester Gregory, who was riding in the truck\u2019s cab, told the Commercial Appeal the next day. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was happening.

In 1999 she developed designer Giorgio Armani\u2019s makeup line\u2014in my opinion, still one of the top three foundation formulations and shade ranges on the market. In 2004 she was named creative director of Procter & Gamble cosmetics, which includes lines like SK-II, Dolce & Gabbana and CoverGirl. In 2013 Queen Elizabeth II named McGrath an MBE, or Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the fashion and beauty industries.\n\nMcGrath finally founded her own eponymous collection in 2015 based around highly pigmented lipsticks and eye shadows. Without fail, lines around the block accompany each new limited edition launch at her freestanding New York City store, and within hours, her website sells out of her flawlessly curated $125 eye shadow palettes and $38 lipsticks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI worked with McGrath and her team a month ago for the British Fashion Awards and still missed my chance to score the last two offerings of her Matte Trance lipstick and new Lip Fetish lip balm.

Sometimes, the criticism to the criticism goes even further, and racially-tinged epithets like coon, sellout, and negro bed wench are spat in their direction.

Yes, his sons are special basketball players. And he has a special, Trumpian gift for shamelessness and self-promotion. But there are hundred of thousands of Black dads who stand up for their sons just like he does. And are willing to challenge White people just like he does. And are just as active in their kids' lives as he is. The only difference between Lavar Ball and literally any Black dad you can find doing Mikan drills with his son or daughter on a YMCA court today is that Lavar has a megaphone. A megaphone we only bother listening to because his sons are great players.\n\nExcusing his fuckshit and defending him as some rare and precious jewel of Black manhood and Black fatherhood implicitly agrees with the worst stereotypes about Black men and Black fathers. That we're so rare that Lavar Ball has to be handled like the Hope fucking Diamond. The same could be said about Umar Johnson. Who's defended like he's The Last Airbender, when I can personally name, right now without Google, (at least) 40 real actual Black men with real actual PhDs who are knowledgable about race and racism and unafraid to confront Whiteness and aren't misogynists and homophobes and haven't used GoFundMe donations to buy Muscle Milk and Bigen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, this defense is what happens when you've allowed what the world expects of Black men to exist as your standard. You start believing the hype \u2014 insisting that A Black Man Doing A Thing is so isolated and rarefied that it's worth excusing all the terrible just to preserve the talent. And while this train of thought might possess the veneer of pro-Blackness, it's actually pervasively anti-Black, as the coddling suggests that these men aren't able to be better people. Like it's impossible for us to be talented and not terrible.\n\nAnd yea, it's true that there are countless forces out there actively trying to kill us. Police. Donald Trump. Darth Susans. Office potlucks. And we need as much protection from them as we can get.

These men struggled against the noose of white supremacy to proclaim their dignity. They stood, shoulder to shoulder, armed with picket signs and perseverance, determined to declare to the world, \u201cI am a man.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe men had long been subjected to unsafe working conditions and forced to survive without being paid a livable wage. They compromised their health and risked their lives to pick up the trash of people who treated them as if they were disposable themselves. It was the deaths of sanitation workers Echol Cole and Robert Walker\u2014who were crushed by a garbage truck on Feb. 1, 1968\u2014that filled the sanitation workers with a sense of urgency.\n\nFrom Feb. 12 to April 16, 1968, the sanitation strikers fought for liberation. They fought because it was time, as Martin Luther King Jr. said on April 3, the day before he was assassinated, for \u201cAmerica to be true to what you said on paper.\u201d They fought because they knew that in this rich nation, their personhood should be unassailable.\n\nThese were men, not \u201cboys,\u201d and in those days, you were not considered a man if you couldn\u2019t provide for your family. You were not a man if the brutal economic and state violence that weighed on your back brought you to your knees\u2014and these men were unwilling to serve as property of the city of Memphis or Jim Crow anymore.\n\nToo often, the sanitation strikers\u2019 experiences lived in the background of King\u2019s assassination, and it is our duty to change that narrative. Each time he came to Memphis, King insisted that the focus be on the 1,300 men as they fought to topple the white supremacist plantation economy holding their families hostage in a supposedly free country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKing on the Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike \u201cNow we\u2019re going to march again, and we\u2019ve got to march again in order to put the issue where it is supposed to be and force everybody to see that there are 1,300 of God\u2019s children here suffering, sometimes going hungry, going through dark and dreary nights wondering how this thing is going to come out. That\u2019s the issue. And we\u2019ve got to say to the nation, we know how it\u2019s coming out. For when people get caught up with that which is right and they are willing to sacrifice for it, there is no stopping point short of victory.\u201d \u2014Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nThe Root partnered with Striking Voices, a Memphis-based multimedia journalism project created by journalist and author Emily Yellin, to produce 1,300 Men: Memphis Strike \u201968, an 11-part video series that brings the sanitation strikers\u2019 stories to the forefront, where they belong. Yellin, who has written about the South extensively for the New York Times, first interviewed Memphis sanitation strikers 20 years ago.\n\nStriking Voices builds on the visionary work of Yellin\u2019s parents, David and Carol Lynn Yellin, journalists who began chronicling the 1968 strike in real time, resulting in a six-year multimedia\u2014oral, written and visual history\u2014archival project, now housed at the library of the University of Memphis. Most of the vivid film footage featured in 1,300 Men was collected by her parents in 1968 as a cornerstone of their pioneering work.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the course of the next three months, through exclusive interviews with the workers, their families and archival footage, you will get to know and love these men. You will learn from them and you will cry with them. You will relive, in vivid detail, a movement that changed the trajectory of history. You will see how the past is not the past, but a continuum of the same economic and racialized oppression that still targets black, brown and indigenous communities in this country. White supremacist capitalist patriarchy may be a shape-shifter, but you know it when you see it.\n\n1,300 Men: Memphis Strike \u201968 is a labor of love that has come to fruition after countless phone calls, brainstorming sessions and sleepless nights. Every second of every minute of this collaboration during the past two years has been with these brave men and their families in mind. We honor them in this space. We honor their persistence in the face of institutional adversity and state violence. We honor their multifaceted lives and the fullness of their humanity. We recognize that we stand on their shoulders, and this is a call for all of us to carry on the tradition of resistance that has brought us thus far.\n\nWith this project, we unpack a moment in history that cannot be distilled down to solely the tragic death of one great man. In Memphis, 1968, working-class black men, women and children stood and said, \u201cNo more.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are their stories.\n\nFollow @TheRoot and @strikingvoices along with the hashtag #1300Men on Twitter as we begin \u201clive\u201d-tweeting historical moments from the strike starting Feb. 1.\n\n", "keywords": ["workers", "watch", "strikers", "neverbeentold", "strike", "video", "sanitation", "going", "memphis", "series", "1968", "fought", "1300", "shares", "men"], "polarity": 0.06933205683205684, "subjectivity": 0.4437153124653126},

New York-based artist Kehinde Wiley \u2014 known for reimagining traditional Western art and putting African Americans both anonymous and famous as the focus \u2014 was selected to bring the former POTUS\u2019 image on to canvas. Baltimore-based artist Amy Sherald brought FLOTUS to life using oil on linen using a more modern touch, using her signature gray palette.\n\nThis moment, with black artists celebrating black accomplishments, was lost on no one, least of all the Obamas, who noted that they were the first in their families to sit for a portrait.\n\n\u201cI am humbled, I am honored, I am proud. I am so incredibly grateful to all the people who came before me in this journey. The folks who built the foundation upon which I stand,\u201d Michelle Obama told the audience who came to celebrate the big moment. \u201cI am also thinking about all the young people, particularly girls and girls of color, who in years ahead will come to this place and they will look up and see an image of someone who looks like them hanging on the wall of this great American institution.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI know the kind of impact that will have on their lives, because I was one of those girls,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd when I think about those future generations and generations past, I think again, wow. What an incredible journey we are on together in this country.\u201d\n\nIn true Michelle Obama fashion, the first lady in her choice of artist, and in her choice of dress, chose to share her spotlight with rising stars. The dress featured in the portrait was designed by Michelle Smith\u2019s label Milly, and even that had extreme significance, with Sherald sharing how the geometric patterns reminded her of the quilts of Gee\u2019s Bend, a small, remote, black community in Alabama known for its quilt masterpieces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former FLOTUS portrait captures her seated, with one hand tucked under her chin as she stares out at those surveying her. Her expression cool, confident, unflinching.\n\n\u201cThe act of Michelle Obama being her authentic self became a profound statement that engaged all of us, because what you represent to this country is an ideal, a human being with integrity, intellect, confidence and compassion,\u201d Sherald, the winner of the 2016 Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition, a rising star in the art world, told the audience.\n\nThe former President, on the other hand, was his usual charming self (please come back) , joking as he surveyed his colorful and vibrant portrait.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cKehinde relative to Amy was working at a disadvantage because his subject was less becoming,\u201d he quipped. \u201cNot as fly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI tried to negotiate less grey hair and Kehinde\u2019s artistic integrity would not allow him to do what I asked. I tried to negotiate smaller ears, struck out on that as well,\u201d the former president said as the audience chuckled.\n\nBarack Obama was painted sitting on a wooden chair among dense foliage with pops of colorful flowers. That was a purposeful touch by artist Wiley, who noted that some of the flowers carry special meaning to the president and his journey through life. The chrysanthemums give a nod to Chicago, the jasmine evokes Hawaii, where the President grew up, and of course the African blue lilies give nod to his Kenyan heritage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe ability to be the first African American to paint the first African American President of the United States; it doesn\u2019t get any better than that,\u201d Wiley said. \u201cI was humbled by this invitation.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr President I thank you for giving me a chance, and I thank you for giving this nation a chance to experience your splendor on a global scale,\u201d the artist added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe newest additions to the gallery will be on view to the public beginning Feb. 13.", "keywords": ["portrait", "official", "black", "shining", "artist", "told", "barack", "unveiling", "michelle", "history", "african", "moment", "wiley", "using", "obama", "president", "obamas"], "polarity": 0.15363906926406928, "subjectivity": 0.39663419913419906},

I love wax prints (yes, I know they\u2019re actually Dutch/Indonesian), indigo mudcloth, Coptic crosses and Moroccan wedding blankets, and happen to be writing this while sitting under a red Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9 feather headdress gifted to me by a godmother who regularly visits the continent. I was born into that generation of children given African names by newly \u201cwoke\u201d parents (mine borrowed from the title of a Miles Davis song). And I may have rocked an African medallion in the early \u201990s, and head wraps well before Erykah Badu dropped her debut single.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s 2017, and I have no intention of attending a kinara-lighting ceremony looking like I\u2019m wearing a Kwanzaa costume. I\u2019m also not immune to the argument that there\u2019s a measure of appropriation in the way many of us approach wearing African fashion, as posited in 2015 by writer Zipporah Gene.\n\nWhile Gene\u2019s argument had a few holes, in an era in which African-inspired fashions and decor have reached peak popularity, it\u2019s well worth ongoing consideration and discussion of where the appreciation of our mother culture began and how to ensure it doesn\u2019t cross the appropriative line. As writer Nadra Nittle noted, in response to Gene\u2019s thesis:\n\nDonning dashikis, rejecting straightened hair, and taking on Afrocentric names directly originated from the \u201cblack is beautiful\u201d movement, which promoted black self-love. Embracing an African aesthetic during this period required courage, considering that in the recent past black students were discouraged from wearing bright colors, let alone African dress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo is there a right way to pay reverence to the culture while rocking a current trend? Of course. To start, don\u2019t treat it like a trend. But in addition, I like to follow a few basic guidelines:\n\nShop From the Source\n\nDid you know you can buy Ankara-printed dresses on Amazon.com for under $50? Of course, you could also spend several hundreds more, and buy them from English designer and Beatle progeny Stella McCartney, who was taken to task this fall for using African prints (and a noticeable lack of African models) in her Spring 2018 collection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeedless to say, there are better ways to get the look while supporting designers of the African Diaspora: Think less Stella McCartney, more Stella Jean\u2014or Nigerian-born Duro Olowu. I personally love to support African designers by hitting African-owned Etsy and pop-up shops, like the many thrown by online marketplace Zuvaa this past year.\n\nA recent new find at one of these events? Benin-born designer Eldior Sodeck, whose Ankara-patterned silhouettes range from traditional to Afrofuturist, with nods to athleisure and Japanese kimonos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t Mix and Max Out on Metaphors\n\nWith such a wealth of beautiful African goods out there, it\u2019s tempting to pile it all on\u2014but just because you can doesn\u2019t mean you should. You don\u2019t need to make a statement. African fashions are so striking, it\u2019s generally ideal to pick one item or category\u2014a bag or a blouse or an armful of bracelets (not all at once)\u2014and let that speak for itself. Besides, Africa is an entire continent, which means that putting too many elements together can actually be culturally confusing.\n\nCome Culturally Correct\n\nSince Kwanzaa is an African-American holiday, it\u2019s only fair to remind you that there are plenty of African-American designers doing the damn thing\u2014and evoking African styles and silhouettes in the process. Not sure where to start? Check out Demestik by Reuben Reuel or Onion Cut & Sewn by Whitney Mero. Feeling creative? Brooklyn, N.Y.-based home-design brand AphroChic sells its culturally evocative patterns by the yard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKnow Your History\n\nDo you know where the Ankara print originated, and how it evolved? How about the centuries of religious history behind the Coptic cross? Have you ever unraveled the complicated history of head wraps?\n\nThe fact is, there\u2019s a wealth of information out there to inform and support your style choices (ask Google\u2014she knows everything). Just having some basic knowledge can transform trend chasing into a teachable moment. For instance, if you\u2019re still conflicted about appropriation, Nadra Nittle also gifted us with this little bit of historical reference, which is handy for both Kwanzaa and the greater civil conflict in which we still find ourselves:\n\nAmerican blacks saw a parallel between Africa\u2019s struggle for independence and their own struggle for equal rights in the United States. Their interest in African fashion never stemmed from a desire to rip off African peoples and popularize their customs for profit, as is often the case with cultural appropriation. It stemmed from the desire to carve out a new racial identity in a nation that had not only treated them as sub-humans, but also taught them to buy into damaging stereotypes about their ancestral homeland, further instilling in them a sense of inferiority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Liberian-born designer Abios\u00e9 Decont\u00e9e Massaquoi of Fiend List, the feeling is entirely mutual.\n\n\u201cYou know, I came from Liberia when I was young, and I came to America. And as an immigrant, coming from where I came from, I can appreciate what America [has] done for me,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd so, when I advertise my stuff ... I always, I always try to do it in a way where everybody can wear it, and enjoy it; kind of as a way of getting people together.\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s not appreciation, I don\u2019t know what is.", "keywords": ["fashion", "ankara", "black", "ongoing", "trend", "love", "ankhs", "style", "rock", "right", "way", "argument", "african", "stella", "kwanzaa", "know", "appropriationvsappreciation", "wearing"], "polarity": 0.1284000721500721, "subjectivity": 0.39345306024993526},

The portraits, by Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald respectively\u2014both black painters\u2014are such sharp departures from any previous depictions of a president and first lady that reviews were understandably mixed, even amongst our own crew here at The Root (including yours truly).\n\n\n\nEspecially when considering Mrs. Obama\u2019s portrait, it took a moment to reconcile her portrayal with our expectations. Where was the warmth we\u2019d become so accustomed to during the Obama era? The radiant smile? The glorious brown skin?\n\nWhile Wiley\u2019s portrait of our 44th President\u2019s portrait seemed lush and even playful\u2014if whimsically unconventional for a leader of the free world\u2014Sherald\u2019s portrait of his wife, posed similarly to Rodin\u2019s The Thinker, seemed to almost recede by comparison, like a cherished photograph that had already faded much too soon for our comfort. To some of us, it seemed more like a suggestion of our favorite first lady, rather than a portrait of the lady herself.\n\nAnd yet, in the days since\u2014for this writer, at least\u2014it has been difficult not to return to look at it again and again.\n\nAs Doreen St. Felix wrote in a wonderful analysis for the New Yorker:\n\nThe racializing schema of Sherald\u2019s work is to \u2018exclude the idea of color as race,\u2019 she has said, in her artist\u2019s statement. To Sherald, the photorealistic depiction of race\u2014a quality determined by others\u2019 eyes, externally\u2014is a dead end. Applied to Michelle Obama, the lack of brown in the skin feels first like a loss, and then like a real gain. This is a different Michelle, a woman evacuated of celebrity, who appears provisionally dreamlike, nearly a shadow. The mouth and the eyes and the strong arms that we know are present, but fainter. From some distance, I can imagine, the figure might not be immediately recognizable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf the many things that have been written about Mrs. Obama\u2019s portrait since its unveiling last Monday, several articles have focused on the dress she chose to be immortalized in, made by American (semi)affordable luxury label Milly, designed by Michelle Smith. Indeed, it is the most visually striking element of the portrait, featuring graphic-patterned patches in black, red, yellow, pink and beige, scattered across the white foreground of the skirt. It drapes across Mrs. Obama\u2019s lap in much the same way I remember quilts draping across my Mississippian great-grandmother\u2019s lap decades ago.\n\nMany have been quick to make the same comparison, especially noting similarities between Mrs. Obama\u2019s dress and the famously graphic geometric quilts created for over a century in Gee\u2019s Bend, Alabama. At the unveiling, artist Amy Sherald spoke to the similarities herself, saying:\n\nThe dress chosen for this painting was designed by Milly. It has an abstract pattern that reminded me of the Dutch artist Piet Mondrian\u2019s geometric paintings. But Milly\u2019s design also resembles the inspired quilt masterpieces made by the women of Gee\u2019s Bend, a small remote black community in Alabama where they compose quilts in geometries that transform clothes and fabric remnants into masterpieces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut designer Smith apparently had no such correlation in mind when she created the print. She spoke to Vogue about the dress, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s made of a stretch cotton poplin print in a clean, minimal, geometric print without a reference to anything past or nostalgic, which gives the dress a very forward-thinking sensibility\u2014this is very Michelle Obama.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut while Michelle Smith may not have read a metaphor for quilting in her own work, is it safe for her to assume that a woman as aware and astute as Michelle Obama\u2014well known for her strategic sartorial statements\u2014didn\u2019t? Aside from evoking the great American southern tradition of quilting\u2014as well as the stars and stripes famously handsewn for this country\u2014is it so outlandish to consider that her gown might also evoke the racial patchwork that comprises the country her husband so recently led?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo glean more insight, The Glow Up spoke with textile artist, clothing designer, children\u2019s book author and illustrator, and master quilter Cozbi Cabrera, a 2017 Lincoln Center artist-in-residence whose own quilts have been shown in the Myrtle Beach Art Museum, concurrent with an exhibit on the quilters of Gee\u2019s Bend. Like many others, she isn\u2019t so quick to discredit the correlation between the white American designer dress and the black American South.\n\nWell, I think for starters that designers have to be aware that they are influenced greatly, and that fashion overall is derivative. So, whether we are doing it consciously or subconsciously, there is something about putting all of these elements together that\u2019s going to strike a chord or trigger a memory or something. So, I think that she\u2019s probably not being\u2014I wouldn\u2019t even use the word \u2018truthful\u2019\u2014I think that she\u2019s probably not being aware of this idea that fashion is derivative. So, it comes from somewhere. And I think that rightfully so, [Amy Sherald\u2019s] notion of her choice is very telling as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCabrera is also quick to note the very \u201cAmerican story\u201d of Gee\u2019s Bend, an isolated peninsula about 35 miles southwest of Selma, Alabama, with a population of less than 300, according to the 2010 Census. Primarily African-American and reachable almost exclusively by ferry, in 1965, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. visited the enclave three weeks before Selma\u2019s \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d to encourage voter registration. However, three years before, Alabama\u2019s government had shut down ferry service to nearby Camden, further isolating the community from basic necessities like medical attention, employment, and participation in the democratic process.\n\nAnd yet, even in isolation, their traditions continued. In 2002, the Whitney Museum in New York mounted a show of the quilts of Gee\u2019s Bend, to rave reviews. The New York Times\u2019 art critic called them \u201ceye-poppingly gorgeous,\u201d while others marveled at the fact that these modernist creations could have generated within a place seemingly cut off from inspiration, as Cabrera notes:\n\n[T]heir quilts showed up at the Whitney Museum in New York, and the reviews came back that what they were doing rivaled anything that you\u2019d find in 20th-century art. ... how could it be? How could they have these sophisticated influences if they were in isolation? And it\u2019s almost like an assumption that the creator\u2014or what I would call the Divine\u2014sort of sprinkles sophistication and aesthetic instincts only on a particular group of people, in only a particular geographic location, you know?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilarly, Cabrera believes it may be short-sighted to underestimate the deep significance and skill in Sherald\u2019s portrait of Michelle Obama\u2014or to assume the former First Lady\u2019s intentions in choosing her for the commission. Because ultimately, isn\u2019t art\u2014like beauty\u2014in the eye of the beholder?\n\nI think that in a less masterful hand, most people have a tendency to kind of throw in the kitchen sink, and in my mind, [Sherald] made some very deliberate choices as to what to leave out and what was left was the likeness of Michelle Obama. So we got that it was her\u2014you know it was quite a bit of fluidity of line, and then these elements of patch. All that\u2019s left in my mind visually were the essentials to kind of like, tell the story. How [Milly designer Michelle Smith] might feel about that, I think it\u2019s almost not even relevant because I think that the larger community got what was being communicated. And so, I think that\u2019s why you keep hearing, again and again, this notion of [the] quilt. I think that there\u2019s a language that we all understand, and that\u2019s what you get with people groups; like the things that don\u2019t have to be spoken but are understood. ... It\u2019s not uncanny that the community is saying similar things along a similar vein, because we do have this common understanding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those of us whom, at first glance, might have wanted something more colorful and dramatic from our first black First Lady, perhaps it\u2019s worth taking a beat, and considering who Michelle Obama really is, as Cabrera\u2019s deft analysis reminds us:\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s the visual equivalent of a stage whisper, which draws more attention to itself.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["portrait", "dress", "black", "included", "bend", "picture", "gees", "quilts", "michelle", "lady", "obama", "think"], "polarity": 0.147996758631087, "subjectivity": 0.42747813960500525},

In 1959, for example, I detected a growing interest in Black history and authorized a pathfinding Black history series. The response was so enthusiastic that we published a book, Lerone Bennett\u2019s Before the Mayflower, which became one of the most widely read Black History books ever. This marked the beginning of the Johnson Publishing Company Book Division. . . .\u201d\n\nDespite Bennett\u2019s passion for writing history for the average person, he wanted journalists to be generalists. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed that you write history one day and you write entertainment the next,\u201d he said in \u201cWriting for a Black Publication,\u201d (video) a 2010 interview with the Visionary Project.\n\nThus, his Ebony would feature such purported people-pleasers as \u201cIs It True What They Say About Twins?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBennett\u2019s association with Ebony, which he helped make the nation\u2019s leading African American publication, ended in 2009 when the publication forced his daughter Joy from the editorial staff.

The magazine complied, adding that \u201chis wise counsel will always be appreciated.\u201d\n\nBennett was born in Clarksdale, Miss., and grew up in Jackson.

He has always considered Morehouse as the center of his academic development. After graduating, Bennett formally entered the world of journalism as a reporter for the now defunct Atlanta Daily World. He became the city editor for the magazine and worked there until 1953, when he began his work as an associate editor at Jet magazine in Chicago, Illinois. In 1954, Bennett became an associate editor at Ebony and he was promoted to senior editor of the magazine in 1958. Since then, his comprehensive articles have become one of the magazine\u2019s literary hallmarks.\u201d He retired in 2005.\n\nAt Morehouse, Bennett was a classmate of Martin Luther King Jr., Mohr wrote.\n\nMohr\u2019s story also said, \u201cIn 2006 he was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the National Association of Black Journalists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn February, Bennett\u2019s footprints and those of 12 others were added to the International Civil Rights Walk of Fame near the Atlanta church where King preached.

In the immigration fight on the Hill, there is broad bipartisan consensus to legalize the \u2018dreamers\u2019 \u2014 illegal immigrants brought here as children \u2014 and to fortify border security.

It really is a hair-care must-have.\n\n\n\nOf the growth of her brand, Eleyae says, \u201c100,000 happy customers later, Slap has become a successful, family-run, female-owned business that provides modern hair protection for modern women.\u201d\n\nStarted by best-friend duo Blaire Brown and Jordan Wallace, this brand is the manifestation of the saying \u201cNecessity breeds invention.\u201d These Philadelphia natives saw a lack of offerings in the headwear market from those concerned about hair health, noting that the wool and cotton of typical hats would cause breakage and damage. They created Natural Born Hats LLC in 2013 to fulfill these needs, and have been going strong ever since. Each hat in their collection has a satin lining sewn in. No need to double up on do-rags or bonnets under your hats\u2014this all-in-one solution takes care of all that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith beanies and brim, bucket and baseball hats, these ladies have really thought of everything when it comes to the needs and wants of their hair-conscious clients. \u201cSatin-lined & peace of mind\u201d is the mission of the two business owners, and they do just that through their online store and Philly-area pop-up shops.\n\n\n\nI stumbled upon this brand\u2019s Instagram page while searching for gifts last Christmas. Founded by Shawn Clarke, Constant Covering is a gorgeous line of pretied, satin-lined head wraps. Yup, you read that right. All those hours of watching YouTube tutorials to get the perfectly knotted wrap are no more\u2014these ready-to-wear statement pieces are truly an innovative need met.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEach pretied wrap has an elastic band to keep the piece secure all day long. With self-tied, hemmed-edge head wraps and reversible satin-lined head ties, this online store is a one-stop shop for all of your fashionable head-covering needs. The small business has started to get the attention of celebrities, with Jilly from Philly often seen rocking the \u201cLisa Headwrap.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile I was chatting with Clarke about the growth of her brand, she shared that the brand really started from a personal need in her own life to have an on-the-go alternative to the head wraps and scarves that she usually tied (and retied) before heading out in the morning. \u201cOur products provide trendy and chic designs on the outside, while the satin-lined interior protects your tresses ... I call it the protective-styling hack.\u201d\n\n\n\nBesides having a truly amazing product, Clarke is a humble and thoughtful CEO, giving personal shoutouts and thank-yous to all of her customers. Her mission for Constant Covering is to \u201chelp women recognize their beauty through covering,\u201d all while becoming a global go-to for women who are conscious of the health of their coils and desire the intricate look of head wraps without spending the time. Clarke shared her perspective on the importance of buying black while being a black entrepreneur: \u201c[The black community] is the most influential consumer on the planet. Why not show how strong we can be together?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHave you ever looked at something and asked yourself, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I think of that? That\u2019s genius!\u201d These were my exact words when I clicked on Layd\u2019s beautiful website. This innovative brand is bringing both fashion and function in its stylish, yet classic headwear with removable silk linings. The site truthfully states that \u201csacrificing the health of your hair for style should not be the norm\u201d\u2014and I couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\nWith Layd gaining attention from multiple media outlets, it seems that everyone is recognizing that this headwear makes the perfect gift for the lady in your life who cares about fashion and follicles. The zip-out high-quality silk lining not only protects your hair from the friction of coarse fibers like wool and cotton, but also allows you to wash and dry the lining to keep your strands buildup-free. With all products made in and shipped throughout the U.S., you can\u2019t go wrong with ordering a hat (or two) for this cold winter ahead\u2014one to get, and one to give.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile this brand is not headwear exclusive, Black Owned Outerwear is a company worth knowing. This Cincinnati-based brick-and-mortar store has thankfully brought its collection to the masses with the launch of an online store. With \u201cBlack Owned Est. 19XX\u201d etched on every item in their collection, there is no doubt that this brand is making unapologetic pride in being black a serious fashion statement.\n\nIts ready-to-wear collection offers jackets, sweaters, legging sets and accessories for men, women and children\u2014enough options to have the whole family \u201cBlack Owned\u201d from head to toe. Recently, the brand has been seen on TRL, at Afrotech, and on celebrities like Tank, DC Young Fly and dancing duo Ayo & Teo. Black Owned is gaining popularity by the day and showing the fashion industry the power of black business.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuying black isn\u2019t just about retail; it\u2019s about wholesale, too, and using black suppliers to manufacture the products we make. The Rev. Georgiette Morgan-Thomas recognized this importance when a well-known hat factory in Philadelphia\u2014S&S Hat Co.\u2014went up for sale.\n\nMorgan-Thomas, a Harlem resident and owner of a hat showroom on Strivers\u2019 Row, personally owns over 100 hats and wanted to expand her lifestyle of hat wearing beyond just buying them for herself. She purchased the Pennsylvania hat factory and renamed it American Hats LLC. As Morgan-Thomas told the New York Times, \u201cThe hat is empowering. ... It gives a woman good posture. When something is on your head, you hold your head up straight.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer blossoming brand has an online retail store and wholesale offerings for those interested in buying in bulk for their businesses.

The portraits, by Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald respectively\u2014both black painters\u2014are such sharp departures from any previous depictions of a president and first lady that reviews were understandably mixed, even amongst our own crew here at The Root (including yours truly).\n\n\n\nEspecially when considering Mrs. Obama\u2019s portrait, it took a moment to reconcile her portrayal with our expectations. Where was the warmth we\u2019d become so accustomed to during the Obama era? The radiant smile? The glorious brown skin?\n\nWhile Wiley\u2019s portrait of our 44th President\u2019s portrait seemed lush and even playful\u2014if whimsically unconventional for a leader of the free world\u2014Sherald\u2019s portrait of his wife, posed similarly to Rodin\u2019s The Thinker, seemed to almost recede by comparison, like a cherished photograph that had already faded much too soon for our comfort. To some of us, it seemed more like a suggestion of our favorite first lady, rather than a portrait of the lady herself.\n\nAnd yet, in the days since\u2014for this writer, at least\u2014it has been difficult not to return to look at it again and again.\n\nAs Doreen St. Felix wrote in a wonderful analysis for the New Yorker:\n\nThe racializing schema of Sherald\u2019s work is to \u2018exclude the idea of color as race,\u2019 she has said, in her artist\u2019s statement. To Sherald, the photorealistic depiction of race\u2014a quality determined by others\u2019 eyes, externally\u2014is a dead end. Applied to Michelle Obama, the lack of brown in the skin feels first like a loss, and then like a real gain. This is a different Michelle, a woman evacuated of celebrity, who appears provisionally dreamlike, nearly a shadow. The mouth and the eyes and the strong arms that we know are present, but fainter. From some distance, I can imagine, the figure might not be immediately recognizable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf the many things that have been written about Mrs. Obama\u2019s portrait since its unveiling last Monday, several articles have focused on the dress she chose to be immortalized in, made by American (semi)affordable luxury label Milly, designed by Michelle Smith. Indeed, it is the most visually striking element of the portrait, featuring graphic-patterned patches in black, red, yellow, pink and beige, scattered across the white foreground of the skirt. It drapes across Mrs. Obama\u2019s lap in much the same way I remember quilts draping across my Mississippian great-grandmother\u2019s lap decades ago.\n\nMany have been quick to make the same comparison, especially noting similarities between Mrs. Obama\u2019s dress and the famously graphic geometric quilts created for over a century in Gee\u2019s Bend, Alabama. At the unveiling, artist Amy Sherald spoke to the similarities herself, saying:\n\nThe dress chosen for this painting was designed by Milly. It has an abstract pattern that reminded me of the Dutch artist Piet Mondrian\u2019s geometric paintings. But Milly\u2019s design also resembles the inspired quilt masterpieces made by the women of Gee\u2019s Bend, a small remote black community in Alabama where they compose quilts in geometries that transform clothes and fabric remnants into masterpieces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut designer Smith apparently had no such correlation in mind when she created the print. She spoke to Vogue about the dress, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s made of a stretch cotton poplin print in a clean, minimal, geometric print without a reference to anything past or nostalgic, which gives the dress a very forward-thinking sensibility\u2014this is very Michelle Obama.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut while Michelle Smith may not have read a metaphor for quilting in her own work, is it safe for her to assume that a woman as aware and astute as Michelle Obama\u2014well known for her strategic sartorial statements\u2014didn\u2019t? Aside from evoking the great American southern tradition of quilting\u2014as well as the stars and stripes famously handsewn for this country\u2014is it so outlandish to consider that her gown might also evoke the racial patchwork that comprises the country her husband so recently led?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo glean more insight, The Glow Up spoke with textile artist, clothing designer, children\u2019s book author and illustrator, and master quilter Cozbi Cabrera, a 2017 Lincoln Center artist-in-residence whose own quilts have been shown in the Myrtle Beach Art Museum, concurrent with an exhibit on the quilters of Gee\u2019s Bend. Like many others, she isn\u2019t so quick to discredit the correlation between the white American designer dress and the black American South.\n\nWell, I think for starters that designers have to be aware that they are influenced greatly, and that fashion overall is derivative. So, whether we are doing it consciously or subconsciously, there is something about putting all of these elements together that\u2019s going to strike a chord or trigger a memory or something. So, I think that she\u2019s probably not being\u2014I wouldn\u2019t even use the word \u2018truthful\u2019\u2014I think that she\u2019s probably not being aware of this idea that fashion is derivative. So, it comes from somewhere. And I think that rightfully so, [Amy Sherald\u2019s] notion of her choice is very telling as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCabrera is also quick to note the very \u201cAmerican story\u201d of Gee\u2019s Bend, an isolated peninsula about 35 miles southwest of Selma, Alabama, with a population of less than 300, according to the 2010 Census. Primarily African-American and reachable almost exclusively by ferry, in 1965, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. visited the enclave three weeks before Selma\u2019s \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d to encourage voter registration. However, three years before, Alabama\u2019s government had shut down ferry service to nearby Camden, further isolating the community from basic necessities like medical attention, employment, and participation in the democratic process.\n\nAnd yet, even in isolation, their traditions continued. In 2002, the Whitney Museum in New York mounted a show of the quilts of Gee\u2019s Bend, to rave reviews. The New York Times\u2019 art critic called them \u201ceye-poppingly gorgeous,\u201d while others marveled at the fact that these modernist creations could have generated within a place seemingly cut off from inspiration, as Cabrera notes:\n\n[T]heir quilts showed up at the Whitney Museum in New York, and the reviews came back that what they were doing rivaled anything that you\u2019d find in 20th-century art. ... how could it be? How could they have these sophisticated influences if they were in isolation? And it\u2019s almost like an assumption that the creator\u2014or what I would call the Divine\u2014sort of sprinkles sophistication and aesthetic instincts only on a particular group of people, in only a particular geographic location, you know?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilarly, Cabrera believes it may be short-sighted to underestimate the deep significance and skill in Sherald\u2019s portrait of Michelle Obama\u2014or to assume the former First Lady\u2019s intentions in choosing her for the commission. Because ultimately, isn\u2019t art\u2014like beauty\u2014in the eye of the beholder?\n\nI think that in a less masterful hand, most people have a tendency to kind of throw in the kitchen sink, and in my mind, [Sherald] made some very deliberate choices as to what to leave out and what was left was the likeness of Michelle Obama. So we got that it was her\u2014you know it was quite a bit of fluidity of line, and then these elements of patch. All that\u2019s left in my mind visually were the essentials to kind of like, tell the story. How [Milly designer Michelle Smith] might feel about that, I think it\u2019s almost not even relevant because I think that the larger community got what was being communicated. And so, I think that\u2019s why you keep hearing, again and again, this notion of [the] quilt. I think that there\u2019s a language that we all understand, and that\u2019s what you get with people groups; like the things that don\u2019t have to be spoken but are understood. ... It\u2019s not uncanny that the community is saying similar things along a similar vein, because we do have this common understanding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those of us whom, at first glance, might have wanted something more colorful and dramatic from our first black First Lady, perhaps it\u2019s worth taking a beat, and considering who Michelle Obama really is, as Cabrera\u2019s deft analysis reminds us:\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s the visual equivalent of a stage whisper, which draws more attention to itself.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["portrait", "dress", "black", "included", "bend", "picture", "gees", "quilts", "michelle", "lady", "obama", "think"], "polarity": 0.147996758631087, "subjectivity": 0.42747813960500525},

Or, perhaps, at my wife\u2019s grandmother\u2019s house in the Hill District, eating smothered turkey burgers with smoked kale greens and washing them down with Pineapple Faygo. But I do remember who I was with: my wife and my 11-year-old niece, the oldest daughter of my wife\u2019s sister.\n\nMore importantly, I remember who we were talking about (Michelle Obama), and I remember it dawning on me that my niece\u2019s only point of reference for a first lady is Michelle Obama. As long as she\u2019s been intellectually mature enough to realize that there is a such a thing as a president and a first lady, they\u2019ve been black. She literally has no memory of a first family being anything else. For someone like me\u2014who still thought as late as 2007 that the idea of a black president was too surreal to seriously consider\u2014this is freaking insane.\n\n\n\nOf course, when one attempts to predict what Michelle Obama\u2019s single greatest legacy will be\u2014the thing we reflect on and remember first when thinking about and assessing her term as first lady\u2014there\u2019s no shortage of viable and worthy contenders. For instance, one could cite that while her husband was the headliner, the rock star, it was Michelle whom America\u2014black America particularly\u2014collectively fell in love with first.\n\n\n\nHer existence effectively granted us permission to put our eggs in the Barack basket. He was safe, and we were safe in his hands, because he was savvy enough to have her. And a vote for him became a vote to see her and her beautiful children in the White House, too. (If feeling particularly silly, you could even note that her marriage to the president provided immortal validation for all the middle-aged uncles who believe it\u2019s cool to hoop with T-shirts tucked into tight sweatpants. Basically, if Barack could do it\u2014and still have someone like Michelle in love with him\u2014then Uncle Tommy could do it, too.)\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy choice, however, would be the effect she\u2019s had and will continue to have on black women and girls like my niece. How vital it\u2019s been for my niece to have a woman who looks like her mom and her aunts be so prominent and protected. And how the ceaseless and baseless attacks on Michelle Obama\u2019s looks and figure forced us to collectively bunker down and defend her, ultimately communicating to girls like my niece that blackness is worthy of guardianship and care.\n\n\n\nI made this point in an essay I contributed to an anthology about Michelle, the final copy edit of which was sent to me for a last look in mid-July, a couple of weeks before the first lady\u2019s then-iconic and now (sadly) ironic Democratic National Convention speech, in which she reminded America of our civic duty to be kind, to be just, to have integrity and to \u201cgo high\u201d when \u201cthey\u201d go low. It\u2019s where she synthesized the grave responsibility of the office\u2014something her husband respected and her candidate would also regard with appropriate reverence and awe\u2014with the surreality of living in a house built by slaves. It was evocative without being too cloying and sentimental; sanguine and idealistic while steeply grounded in a reality engineered by America\u2019s historical context. Her speech was a 14-minute-long distillation of everything the anthology intended to convey; eight years of life and legacy extracted and sublimated into one final testimony. It was why we loved her so damn much.\n\n\n\nIndeed, the anthology was conceived of and completed several months before Donald Trump was elected president\u2014an act so seismic, vibrational and calamitous that it bent and fractured time, reverberating and altering the past like some preternaturally destructive DeLorean. It\u2019s still a bit too soon to do an accurate forensic assessment of how complete and panoramic the damage will be, but we do already know that his win spiritually and psychologically negated whatever racial, social and cultural gains we thought we might have made in the last eight years, and his administration seems poised and eager to do any- and everything possible to literally negate them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIncluded in the batch of people, places, things and histories now transmuted is, unfortunately, what now exists as Michelle Obama\u2019s most conspicuous legacy. The effect she\u2019s had on women and girls\u2014black women and girls particularly\u2014will remain unchanged, as will our memories of her grace, her pliancy, her brilliance, her empathy and her relatability. The people inspired by her Just Move! Initiative will continue to be more mindful of their health and well-being and ways to improve it. And the countless publication covers she\u2019s appeared on will not disappear from the physical and digital archives of those newspapers and magazines.\n\nBut when history looks back on her term as the first lady\u2014while also mindful of the administration following her and those preceding her\u2014I believe she\u2019ll be regarded first as a statistical anomaly. A glitch. A figure from a time when America made a grave error, and actually seemed poised to live up to its lofty ideals and quixotic self-perception, and then immediately righted itself to the point of overcorrection. Not much different from a bank accidentally inserting a million dollars into a person\u2019s checking account and then cleaning out the entire account\u2014including the money already in there\u2014when becoming aware of the mistake.\n\nAnd they\u2014and \u201cthey\u201d in this sense could be citizens, historians, aliens or androids with sentience\u2014will examine our data, will comb through America\u2019s history and majesty and tragedy and hypocrisy, and they\u2019ll know what many Americans have known for the past eight years; what the last three months and the 300 or so years before those last three months have been hell-bent on proving, and what the election has communicated\u2014plainly, violently and unequivocally\u2014to each corner of the world: that this country didn\u2019t deserve her.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat this nation, so fearsome and fertile and massive and magnificent, was inhabited by small and silly people who allowed themselves to be ruled by fear and ludicrous phobia. That, in spite of themselves, they managed to allow this woman to stand for the nation, to serve it and represent it. And after almost a decade of attempting to prove that she didn\u2019t truly belong\u2014she and her husband and her family (all sufficiently American) were somehow un-American\u2014committed an act of reckless self-sabotage just to find themselves right, destroying themselves to rectify what they believed was a fatal irregularity.\n\n\n\nThe irony here\u2014which, depending on your mood, could be genuinely hilarious or abjectly harrowing (or both)\u2014is that the idea that America didn\u2019t deserve Michelle Obama is one on which both ends of the political spectrum can find a consensus. Unfortunately, the consensus would be due to far different interpretations of \u201cdeserve.\u201d Either America didn\u2019t deserve her because it wasn\u2019t good enough for her or America didn\u2019t deserve for her to \u201chappen\u201d to it because she wasn\u2019t good enough for it.\n\nPerhaps an extended explanation of this paradox should be in the footnotes of any anthologies or studies or biographies about her going forward. No need to confound and confuse the historians who will read them\u2014already perplexed that the same nation that would elect a man like Donald Trump president somehow managed to do that while a woman Michelle Obama was still its first lady\u2014any further.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["shes", "deserve", "didnt", "michelle", "women", "remember", "obama", "president", "niece", "america"], "polarity": 0.11626224316489801, "subjectivity": 0.5024013204101702},

In 2002, the Whitney Museum in New York mounted a show of the quilts of Gee\u2019s Bend, to rave reviews. The New York Times\u2019 art critic called them \u201ceye-poppingly gorgeous,\u201d while others marveled at the fact that these modernist creations could have generated within a place seemingly cut off from inspiration, as Cabrera notes:\n\n[T]heir quilts showed up at the Whitney Museum in New York, and the reviews came back that what they were doing rivaled anything that you\u2019d find in 20th-century art. ... how could it be? How could they have these sophisticated influences if they were in isolation? And it\u2019s almost like an assumption that the creator\u2014or what I would call the Divine\u2014sort of sprinkles sophistication and aesthetic instincts only on a particular group of people, in only a particular geographic location, you know?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilarly, Cabrera believes it may be short-sighted to underestimate the deep significance and skill in Sherald\u2019s portrait of Michelle Obama\u2014or to assume the former First Lady\u2019s intentions in choosing her for the commission. Because ultimately, isn\u2019t art\u2014like beauty\u2014in the eye of the beholder?\n\nI think that in a less masterful hand, most people have a tendency to kind of throw in the kitchen sink, and in my mind, [Sherald] made some very deliberate choices as to what to leave out and what was left was the likeness of Michelle Obama. So we got that it was her\u2014you know it was quite a bit of fluidity of line, and then these elements of patch. All that\u2019s left in my mind visually were the essentials to kind of like, tell the story. How [Milly designer Michelle Smith] might feel about that, I think it\u2019s almost not even relevant because I think that the larger community got what was being communicated. And so, I think that\u2019s why you keep hearing, again and again, this notion of [the] quilt. I think that there\u2019s a language that we all understand, and that\u2019s what you get with people groups; like the things that don\u2019t have to be spoken but are understood. ... It\u2019s not uncanny that the community is saying similar things along a similar vein, because we do have this common understanding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those of us whom, at first glance, might have wanted something more colorful and dramatic from our first black First Lady, perhaps it\u2019s worth taking a beat, and considering who Michelle Obama really is, as Cabrera\u2019s deft analysis reminds us:\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s the visual equivalent of a stage whisper, which draws more attention to itself.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["portrait", "dress", "black", "included", "bend", "picture", "gees", "quilts", "michelle", "lady", "obama", "think"], "polarity": 0.147996758631087, "subjectivity": 0.42747813960500525},

The results of that survey were posted to the website Friday. Carl Paladino answered the first two questions in the survey as follows:\n\n\n\nArtvoice: What would you most like to happen in 2017? Paladino: Obama catches mad cow disease after being caught having relations with a Herford. He dies before his trial and is buried in a cow pasture next to Valerie Jarret[t], who died weeks prior, after being convicted of sedition and treason, when a Jihady cell mate mistook her for being a nice person and decapitated her. Artvoice: What would you like to see go away in 2017? Paladino: Michelle Obama. I\u2019d like her to return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie, the gorilla.\n\nIn a statement to the Washington Post, Paladino denied that the comments were racist.\n\n\u201cIt has nothing to do with race,\u201d Paladino said. \u201cThat\u2019s the typical stance of the press when they can\u2019t otherwise defend the acts of the person being attacked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about 2 progressive elitist ingrates who have hated their country so badly and destroyed its fabric in so many respects in 8 years,\u201d Paladino added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaladino confirmed to the Post that he made the comments and said he is currently involved in President-elect Trump\u2019s transition efforts.\n\n\u201cI don't think Mr. Trump particularly cares what I have to say,\u201d Paladino said. \u201cHe knows me. I was active with him, and I still am active with him.\n\n\u201cAnd that's it. I'll say what I feel like saying,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nThe Post notes that Paladino has repeatedly attacked President Obama over the years, both publicly and privately. He pushed the falsehood that the president is a Muslim, and during his gubernatorial race he was accused of sending graphically racist and sexist emails\u2014some of which targeted Obama\u2014to his friends. Paladino never denied sending the emails.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump spokeswoman Jessica Ditto condemned Paladino\u2019s comments, as did New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\n\n\"Carl's comments are absolutely reprehensible, and they serve no place in our public discourse,\" Ditto said.\n\nCuomo issued a statement in which he slammed Paladino for a \u201clong history of racist and incendiary comments.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Carl Paladino, a Republican Party official from Western New York, made racist, ugly and reprehensible remarks about President Obama and the First Lady Michelle Obama,\" Cuomo said. \"While most New Yorkers know Mr. Paladino is not to be taken seriously, as his erratic behavior defies any rational analysis and he has no credibility, his words are still jarring.\u201d\n\nThis is yet another incident in a long line of offenses that highlight the unashamedly racist rhetoric of Trump supporters. The level of disrespect for the president of the United States is disappointing, especially in light of the constant demands for black people to \u201cgive Trump a chance.\u201d\n\nAt what point will Trump supporters be called out and told to stop the nonsense racist rhetoric?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at Artvoice and the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["post", "comments", "trump", "2017", "york", "dead", "disease", "cow", "mad", "adviser", "paladino", "survey", "obama", "president", "racist", "wants"], "polarity": -0.006625226625226617, "subjectivity": 0.47842398342398335},

And I think a lot of times we don\u2019t do that. We spend our time pleasing, satisfying, looking out into the world to define who we are\u2014listening to the messages, the images, the limited definitions that people have of who we are. And that\u2019s true for women of color for sure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"There is a limited box that we are put in, and if we live by that limited definition, we miss out on a lot of who we are. But it takes taking the time to know who you are to be able to deal with the onslaught of negative messages that you\u2019re bound to get. So for me, I came into this with a pretty clear sense of myself. And some of that comes with age. Some of that comes with experience,\u201d the first lady concluded.\n\nThe United State of Women summit was a comprehensive gathering on women\u2019s issues in Washington featuring top leaders in business, technology and women\u2019s advocacy. The summit focused on pay equity, higher education, health issues, self-esteem and career advancement.\n\nWinfrey, Vice President Joe Biden and, of course, the first lady\u2019s husband, President Barack Obama, addressed the daylong event, which was packed with data and information on the current state of women in American society.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur country isn\u2019t just all about the Benjamins\u2014it\u2019s about the Tubmans, too,\u201d the president said amusingly during his address.\n\n\u201cThe year I was born, in 1961, women made up less than 40 percent of college students. Today, you earn almost 60 percent of college degrees, make up roughly half of the workforce. \u2026 In the old days, women actually needed a husband to open a credit card. Today, more women are choosing to be single,\u201d President Obama added.\n\nDespite making up 47 percent of the U.S. workforce, women, on average, still only earn 77 cents for every dollar earned by a man. African-American women are paid 64 cents for each dollar white men are paid, and Hispanic women only make 54 cents for every dollar paid to white men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week the National Center For Education Statistics revealed that black women are No. 1 among all other groups in America in terms of overall college enrollment.\n\n\"As the great Shirley Chisholm once said, \u2018The emotional, sexual and psychological stereotyping of females begin[s] when the doctor says, \u201cIt\u2019s a girl.\u201d\u2019 That has consequences for all of us, whether we\u2019re men or women,\" President Obama said pointedly during the summit.\n\n\"We need to keep changing the attitude that raises our girls to be demure, and our boys to be assertive; that criticizes our daughters for speaking out, and our sons for shedding a tear,\" the president said, echoing some of the themes spoken throughout the day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParticipants at the summit included Melanie Campbell, president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation; Anne Marie Chavez, CEO of Girl Scouts USA; Rep.

And while I know that division makes it difficult to listen to Americans with whom we disagree, that\u2019s what we need to do today.\u201d\n\nCalling it what it is, Obama wrote that \u201crepealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act has become a core tenet of the Republican Party.\u201d He said that senators need to take a step back and measure what\u2019s really at stake, because the rationale for action on health care or any other issue \u201cmust be something more than simply undoing something that Democrats did.\u201d\n\nAnd he\u2019s right. Everything about this administration has been one long middle finger to everything the Obama administration put in place. The slow undoing of anything worthwhile in our government and public policies has been horrifying to watch. Our current president is the old-man embodiment of Regina George, and his entire administration is the Plastics, working their hardest to make everyone else in America miserable while they strut around patting themselves on the back for getting the job undone.\n\nObama continues:\n\nWe didn\u2019t fight for the Affordable Care Act for more than a year in the public square for any personal or political gain\u2014we fought for it because we knew it would save lives, prevent financial misery, and ultimately set this country we love on a better, healthier course.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also notes that for the first time in history, more than 90 percent of Americans know the security of health care, and while health care costs continue to rise, they have been rising at the slowest pace in 50 years.\n\nWomen can\u2019t be charged more for their insurance, young adults can stay on their parents\u2019 plan until they turn 26, contraceptive care and preventive care are now free. Paying more, or being denied insurance altogether due to a preexisting condition\u2014we made that a thing of the past.\n\nObama reiterates his previous point that while the Affordable Care Act was a significant step forward for America, \u201cit was not perfect, nor could it be the end of our efforts,\u201d and that if \u201cRepublicans could put together a plan that is demonstrably better than the improvements we made to our health care system, that covers as many people at less cost,\u201d he would gladly and publicly support it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd since today\u2019s big reveal shows that has not happened, Obama said that he hopes Republicans in Congress will remember that public service is not a gigantic pissing contest, or a dick-measuring one, and they should get down to the business of doing what\u2019s right for the American people.\n\nOK, he didn\u2019t use those words. He said that \u201cpublic service is not about sport or notching a political win, that there\u2019s a reason we all chose to serve in the first place, and that hopefully, it\u2019s to make people\u2019s lives better, not worse.\u201d Same difference.\n\nBut right now, after eight years, the legislation rushed through the House and the Senate without public hearings or debate would do the opposite. It would raise costs, reduce coverage, roll back protections, and ruin Medicaid as we know it. That\u2019s not my opinion, but rather the conclusion of all objective analyses, from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which found that 23 million Americans would lose insurance, to America\u2019s doctors, nurses, and hospitals on the front lines of our health care system. The Senate bill, unveiled today, is not a health care bill. It\u2019s a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America. It hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries, paid for by cutting health care for everybody else. Those with private insurance will experience higher premiums and higher deductibles, with lower tax credits to help working families cover the costs, even as their plans might no longer cover pregnancy, mental health care, or expensive prescriptions. Discrimination based on pre-existing conditions could become the norm again. Millions of families will lose coverage entirely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe rightly points out that if you get sick or start a family, this bill will harm you, and \u201csmall tweaks over the course of the next couple of weeks, under the guise of making these bills easier to stomach, cannot change the fundamental meanness at the core of this legislation.\u201d\n\nThe bill is indeed mean. It matches the ugly, classist, ageist and racist tone of everything else that is happening under the current administration. The poor will suffer unnecessarily. The elderly will suffer unnecessarily. People of color will suffer unnecessarily. And for what? To prove that you can undo what the previous president did for no other reason than to show that your staff is bigger?\n\nTo put the American people through that pain\u2014while giving billionaires and corporations a massive tax cut in return\u2014that\u2019s tough to fathom. But it\u2019s what\u2019s at stake right now. So it remains my fervent hope that we step back and try to deliver on what the American people need.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s not likely to happen, because simply put, this administration does not care about the American people.\n\nObama delivers a call to action, imploring the American people to reach out to their representatives (something we should all be doing daily until this stops) and let them know what this means for American families.\n\nAfter all, this debate has always been about something bigger than politics. It\u2019s about the character of our country\u2014who we are, and who we aspire to be. And that\u2019s always worth fighting for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSorry, President Obama. It would appear that your replacement has turned the character of this country into a cartoon, and that is not likely to change until he and all his minions are thrown out on their asses.", "keywords": ["richest", "health", "transfer", "senate", "public", "whats", "massive", "barack", "wealth", "step", "american", "insurance", "bill", "obama", "administration", "care"], "polarity": 0.015138703456460473, "subjectivity": 0.4296858774662512},

In the mid-1800s, Semmelweis worked in a maternity clinic where a large number of women died during childbirth. He believed that the problem was neither the medicine nor their treatments. Semmelweis believed that there were tiny little creatures living on the clinic\u2019s medical instruments that were making the women sick. He tried to tell the people at the hospital that washing their hands and sterilizing their medical tools in a chlorine mixture would stop the spread of disease.\n\n\n\nEveryone in the medical profession laughed at Dr. Semmelweis. If these \u201cgerms\u201d were making people sick, why hadn\u2019t they heard of them before? More importantly, why couldn\u2019t they see them? Almost every medical professional thought it was a ridiculous theory, but Semmelweis never gave up. He told everyone who would listen about washing hands and sterilizing equipment, but no one listened to him.\n\nWhen he was 47 years old, Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis was committed to an insane asylum, where he died.\n\nWhenever conservative-leaning Caucasians begin listing Barack Obama\u2019s trespasses against America, they don\u2019t get far before they reach the favorite claim of the faction that wants to \u201cmake America great again.\u201d Nestled between their accusations of socialism and sympathizing with terrorists\u2014just above charges of Obama\u2019s madrassa education but below his Kenyan birth\u2014is the most frequently recurring charge against Obama and his administration:\n\nBarack Obama made race relations worse in America.\n\nAccording to his detractors, during Obama\u2019s presidency, racial animus between blacks and whites reached a fever pitch. He presided during the rise of Black Lives Matter. The riots in Ferguson, Mo., happened under his watch. The city of Baltimore burned during an uprising. Beyonc\u00e9 turned black. Everything was falling apart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom their perspective, if Obama gets credit for ending two wars, rescuing the country from the brink of economic collapse and rescuing the auto industry, then he should take the blame for the increasing racial tension that spread across the country during his tenure.\n\nThey see the constant marches, the side eyes they receive in Wal-Mart parking lots, the Colin Kaepernick protest, the anti-police sentiment and even the natural-hair movement as Obama\u2019s fault, and they are upset about it. Before Obama sashayed his meddling ass into the Oval Office, white men were free to wave their Confederate flags, whisper racist jokes and touch whomever\u2019s hair they damn well wanted.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: They are probably right. Barack Obama did make race relations worse ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor white people.\n\nSince its inception, black people have known that this country was sick, but America treated its race problem in the same way the white world has treated everything else. It\u2019s why they feel comfortable teaching us that the Roman Empire ruled the world, even while richer, more advanced civilizations thrived around the globe. It\u2019s why your third-grade social studies teacher can tell you that Christopher Columbus \u201cdiscovered\u201d a land that already had people, governments and even constitutions.\n\nIn the great book of rewritten history, white people invented the blind spot and peekaboo. In their eyes, nothing exists until they see it, and if they refuse to acknowledge it\u2014then it doesn\u2019t exist.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Obama had not signed the Affordable Care Act, killed Osama bin Laden or saved the nation\u2019s economy, the one thing for which he deserves credit is forcing America to confront its ideas about race and racism. He may not have explicitly championed Black Lives Matter or raised a black fist on the White House lawn, but his effect on the psyche of black America is undeniable.\n\nBefore the Obama administration, America could bury its head in the sand because black America knew there were no sympathetic ears inside the Bush regime, and Bill Clinton was too busy instituting mandatory minimums, advocating for unequal drug sentencing and ridding the country of \u201csuperpredators.\u201d The Reagan administration was ... well ... the Reagan administration.\n\nThen came Obama. The fact that a black man held the nation\u2019s highest office forced a national self-examination of its sickness\u2014whether it wanted to or not. Obama\u2019s simple presence gave some white people the heebie-jeebies, and when they were confronted with unapologetic blackness, they weren\u2019t just resistant, they were aghast. They couldn\u2019t believe that Negroes would be so ungrateful for centuries of white benevolence that they would bicker about small details like income inequality, an unfair justice system, education disparities and police lynchings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it is all Obama\u2019s fault. Caucasians say that Obama ruined race relations in the same way that law-enforcement officers say cellphone cameras ruined policing. They were trying to avoid it, but under Obama, black people kept waving white America\u2019s past in its face. You know how black people are. They love bringing up old shit like prejudice.\n\nAnd history.\n\nAnd truth.\n\nThey don\u2019t want to talk about it, because it is an icky sordid past to confront, but the only people who will ever be negatively affected by the increasing dialogue about race in America are racists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust because wypipo ignored racial tension until 2008 doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t exist. Just like Dr. Semmelweis, black America has been trying to tell them about it for years. We have seen the cause of the cancer, watched it spread and witnessed it snuffing out more black lives than anyone can imagine. We have screamed about the invisible disease at the top of our lungs, but they have laughed at us. They called us crazy.

And while I was in tears by the end of his address, I was quickly reminded that not everyone is sad to see him go.\n\nLike all presidencies, Obama\u2019s tenure unquestionably had its share of disappointments and shortcomings. Nevertheless, even in our unmet expectations, he has indisputably raised the bar for what the presidency should represent. His mere presence came with expectations not foisted upon any other American president; the expectations of not just a country, or the world at large, but also of an entire race; a race still mired in a twisted and tortured centuries-long relationship with the country he was elected to lead.\n\nBut as he stepped off the podium Tuesday night, it was hard to escape the feeling that this was not only the end of a presidency; it was also the end of a particular level of poise and dignity in the White House. As Malkia Cyril, activist and executive director of the Center for Media Justice stated:\n\n\u201cI know all he did/didn\u2019t do, but still: there is a grace I can\u2019t deny.\u201d\n\nIndeed, it takes unfathomable grace to manage the presidency as deftly as Obama has; let alone hand over the seat to a coarse, volatile and morally challenged upstart who audaciously and repeatedly questioned his predecessor\u2019s legitimacy to hold the office he was elected to\u2014twice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd if there is a perverse irony in Obama\u2019s love of country compelling him to play de facto mentor to the man who most passionately sought to discredit his citizenship, there is an even deeper paradox in the rhetoric that has now garnered that same man the Oval Office. In keeping with the huckster he is, Donald Trump sold a good portion of Americans\u2014albeit not an official majority\u2014on entitlement to a facade of the American dream. His version conveniently ignores the true origins of economic disparity, while scapegoating minorities, social and technological progress and \u201cAmerican elitism\u201d (read: intellectualism) as the root of all evil, rather than a means of economic mobility.\n\nBut while this has been the type of rhetoric used to pacify and condescend to the lower and working classes of \u201chardworking\u201d (read: white) Americans for decades, it simultaneously promotes the myth of the \u201cmodel minority\u201d\u2014you know, those who \u201cbehave,\u201d work hard and \u201cpull themselves up by their own bootstraps.\u201d And this is the crux of both the paradox and right-wing hypocrisy itself: because aside from overwrought Asian stereotypes, who better embodies the model minority than Barack Obama?\n\nAfter all, Obama is a biracial man born to a young mother and an immigrant, primarily absentee father at the height of the Civil Rights Movement in America. He was raised in large part by middle-class grandparents\u2014his grandfather a veteran of World War II\u2014hailing from the same part of the oft-romanticized \u201cheartland\u201d as the fabled Dorothy Gale in The Wizard of Oz.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA hard worker, the young Obama earned admission and eventually degrees from some of the top academic institutions in the country, eventually working as a community organizer to uplift and advance from within\u2014as model minorities are expected to do.\n\nHis wife of 25 years, \u201cMichelle LaVaughn Robinson, girl of the South Side of Chicago,\u201d as he so lovingly referred to her, is a descendant of slaves, raised in a Christian, middle-class household by two parents. Encouraged to achieve through education, both she and her brother attended Princeton, and she\u2019d subsequently earned her law degree from Harvard the year her future husband enrolled. And with her enviable degrees, she, too, chose to work in the public sector for years before becoming a mother and eventually accompanying her husband to the White House, where they\u2019d raise their children in a family-centric and scandal-free environment as the nation\u2019s first family. Talk about work-life balance.\n\nBoth Barack and Michelle Obama have done everything the American minority is admonished to do: defy the odds, work hard, and give back to their communities. Are these not the type of values the Republican Party\u2014and its president-elect\u2014claim to uphold? And yet, it would seem that the education they achieved in the process was grounds for disqualification from identifying with \u201chardworking Americans.\u201d As blogger and novelist Daryl Sturgis writes:\n\n\u201cWe are told that they are not like us. They don\u2019t like people like us. People who get up and work everyday. People who have our values\u2026(S)omehow our nation has been convinced that people who are hard-working and follow the rules are somehow the elitists who want to destroy America, and a preening narcissist who only cares about himself and acquiring more and more wealth and power will be looking out for the little man.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause, let\u2019s be honest: In reference to Barack and Michelle Obama, \u201celitist\u201d is code for \u201cuppity\u201d\u2014and an uppity Negro has always been a liability in America. To compound the issue, enough of that criticism has been leveled from within the black community to create a zero-sum game, because while we unabashedly adore our first lady, we, too, held Barack Obama to a higher standard than any other American president ... because he was supposed to be ours, first and foremost.\n\nSo, let\u2019s also be honest about this: In seven days, America will swear in the most willfully unqualified president in its history. Donald Trump is a man who embodies the worst of both the American ego and entitlement, and has spent a lifetime coasting on both. This man could no sooner relate to the average, hardworking American than he could one of the likely immigrant employees who clean his gold-plated toilets daily.\n\nBut for all of the hypocrisy of the far right, it has won this round; sacrificing what was left of its storied values for a excessively overblown example of white male mediocrity at its helm, flying in the face of all it claims to hold dear. Seemingly, no amount of scandal\u2014true, hacked or raining down on them like a golden shower\u2014will change that fact. They are wearing their hypocrisy on their sleeves\u2014indeed, waving it gleefully in our faces\u2014simply for the sake of winning a prize that is losing value even as I write this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Wednesday, along with millions of Americans and millions more abroad, I watched the incoming commander in chief, Donald J. Trump, give the most unprepared press conference in presidential history.\n\nMuch has been made of the legacy that Obama will leave on Jan. 20. It would be easy to point out employment statistics, the capture of bin Laden, or the passage of the Marriage Equality and Affordable Care acts. It would be equally easy to reference deportation statistics, drone strikes, respectability politics or reported incidents of police brutality. But as I watched the PEEOTUS bluster and BS his way through his first press event as president-elect, it was clear: Obama\u2019s greatest legacy may very well be the last vestige of logic, poise, or any semblance of sanity and integrity.\n\nBecause what we are now watching is the glorification of hypocrisy.

The results of that survey were posted to the website Friday. Carl Paladino answered the first two questions in the survey as follows:\n\n\n\nArtvoice: What would you most like to happen in 2017? Paladino: Obama catches mad cow disease after being caught having relations with a Herford. He dies before his trial and is buried in a cow pasture next to Valerie Jarret[t], who died weeks prior, after being convicted of sedition and treason, when a Jihady cell mate mistook her for being a nice person and decapitated her. Artvoice: What would you like to see go away in 2017? Paladino: Michelle Obama.

I was active with him, and I still am active with him.\n\n\u201cAnd that's it. I'll say what I feel like saying,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nThe Post notes that Paladino has repeatedly attacked President Obama over the years, both publicly and privately. He pushed the falsehood that the president is a Muslim, and during his gubernatorial race he was accused of sending graphically racist and sexist emails\u2014some of which targeted Obama\u2014to his friends. Paladino never denied sending the emails.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump spokeswoman Jessica Ditto condemned Paladino\u2019s comments, as did New York Gov.

Now I happen to like it. It was well-acted, moving and is probably the second best Marvel movie after Captain America: Winter Soldier, but that\u2019s just me. All black people don\u2019t have to like the Black Panther movie, people like different kinds of movies just like they like different kinds of ice cream. However, what you can\u2019t do is be lactose intolerant, walk into Cold Stone Creamery complain that they didn\u2019t have a non-dairy version of butter cream confetti birthday cake, then write a thousand word think piece on how the ice cream industrial complex is misleading black folks. Yet, like clockwork late night college dorm cypher masquerading as revolutionary Twitter and blackademia are out in force saying Eric Killmonger was right, that the Black Panther movie is anti-revolution and that the white dude got too much screen time. There are plenty of legitimate critiques of Black Panther, but these aren\u2019t it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s get the big one out of the way first. Killmonger wasn\u2019t right. I know that people are having #expressyourunpopularopinion orgasms on Twitter, and I get it, folks are out there hustling for contrarian hot-takes on one of the most successful super hero films of all time to get clicks on their Soundcloud while blocking any disagreement. That\u2019s just social media. Doesn\u2019t mean any of the critiques are right, and most aren\u2019t. Eric Killmonger (who is the best Marvel villain of all time, since Loki really doesn\u2019t count as a villain) defeats T\u2019Challa in ritual combat, takes over as King of Wakanda and Black Panther, and vows to use Wakanda\u2019s advanced weapons to arm oppressed black peoples all over the world. Some people found Killmonger\u2019s aims to be noble and that the Black Panther movie was overt propaganda against revolutionary politics. Or some academics felt the movie demonized black American men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat black revolutionary thought are these folks reading? Killmonger\u2019s desire to free black people from oppression was noble, but his methods were ridiculous and his motives were questionable. Wakandans didn\u2019t resist Killmonger because of his ideas, they didn\u2019t agree with his methods, which were, again, ridiculous. black revolution in America hasn\u2019t failed because we don\u2019t have enough guns, it fails because white folks outnumber us 10 to 1, and that\u2019s in some major metropolitan areas. Weapons for self-defense or chasing the cops and the Klan out of your neighborhood are one thing, but going to war against the United States would mean the extermination of black people no matter how many Vibranium shielded rhinos you shipped to Ferguson. Now if Killmonger had wanted to turn Wakanda into a refuge for oppressed blacks across the globe, or bankrupt the imperialist powers in Europe and America by creating a single African currency based on Vibranium I\u2019m pretty sure T\u2019Challa would have at least been willing to check out a Powerpoint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThing is though, he didn\u2019t have a good plan, no matter how his supporters try to spin it. More importantly Killmonger\u2019s plan wasn\u2019t intentionally bad because Ryan Coogler wanted to discredit revolution, it was bad because there are still a lot of people dumb enough to think that black freedom in America can be achieved through direct combat. Peaceful Black Lives Matter activists get shot on the daily, what do you think would happen to a militarized black uprising?\n\nSpeaking of militancy, the notion that Black Panther is propaganda for incrementalist reform instead of wide scale revolution can only occur to you if you didn\u2019t watch the movie. Wakandans are a never-colonized, ethnocentric isolationist theocratic monarchy. In other words, the country is run by a royal family that worships a magical cat, and they don\u2019t care about anybody or anything beyond their borders, regardless of race. Heck, M\u2019Baku points out that no Black Panther had visited Jabari-Land for a thousand years and that was like a 15 minute hover bike trip from Panther Palace. How would it make sense in this movie for this nation to move from isolationists to pan-African revolutionaries in a few hours just because a guy dressed like Lil Fizz from B2K showed up with some fighting skills and a tattoo on his lip? Killmonger wants revolution, but only if he is in charge, W\u2019Kabi wants imperialism and Nakia wants humanitarianism, and T\u2019Challa is figuring out how to move Wakanda forward and how to get his girl back. Which brings us to the white man in the middle, Agent Ross. Some critics feel the need to center him in the movie, it\u2019s snarky and sloppy pop culture commentary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only reason Agent Ross was in Wakanda is because he took a bullet for the girl that the king was sweating. Notice the Wakandas weren\u2019t sharing Kimoyo beads with all those dead South Koreans lying around after Killmonger freed Klaue. After that they called him colonizer, locked him in a room and when he volunteered to help overthrow Killmonger; Shuri, T\u2019Challa and Nakia gave him the collective, \u201cOh, you\u2019re still here?\u201d look. The Wakandans never trusted, embraced or fully accepted Agent Ross; he was caught up in a palace coup and proved to be useful. If you think Black Panther spent too much time or gave too much focus on Ross you probably think Get Out was really about Detective LaToya and the inner workings of the TSA.\n\nHollywood doesn\u2019t make revolutionary movies, and even movies that \u2018look\u2019 revolutionary are really status quo propaganda. In every Planet of the Apes movie, even after years of being experimented on and oppressed, the monkeys that want justice and revenge on humanity are always the bad guys. In the X-Men movies even though Magneto is right every ... single ... time, he\u2019s the bad guy. In Django Unchained despite being a former slave himself Django cares nothing about freeing others, all he wants is to get his wife back. In other words, Hollywood movies only say violent revolution is okay if the oppressors are robots or aliens that we can\u2019t have sex with (notice why they had so much trouble in Battlestar Galactica?)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, none of these critiques apply to Black Panther, the movie isn\u2019t anti-revolution, it\u2019s a about the best way for black people to carry out our obligations to each other, wrapped up in a coup, and a bunch of CGI and fancy costumes. Killmonger\u2019s goal was noble, but his methods were nonsense and a-historical. Let\u2019s save the concern trolling think pieces until the next Tyler Perry movie, they\u2019re much more worthy candidates for this kind of scorn.", "keywords": ["black", "panther", "wrong", "yall", "movie", "revolutionary", "didnt", "killmonger", "revolution", "know", "movies", "wants", "think"], "polarity": 0.027858126721763094, "subjectivity": 0.4477436704709431},

While Black Panther is a Marvel Cinematic Universe product, it\u2019s still a black movie. From Ryan Coogler to Wakanda to kente cloth in videos to the two capital letters and the apostrophe in the lead character T\u2019Challa\u2019s name, there\u2019s no denying the blackness at play here.\n\nAnd like peanut butter and jelly, Shaq and Kobe, and salt and pepper, black movies aren\u2019t complete without a soundtrack. Can I get an \u201camen\u201d? I think I got an \u201camen.\u201d Do you know why? Because God is good (all the time) and all the time (God is good). Tell me you didn\u2019t say that out loud just now. It\u2019s OK\u2014I know. I did too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201990s were full of movies with great soundtracks. Faizon Love once joked that soundtrack budgets back then were bigger than the budget for the actual movie. Not surprisingly, most of those soundtracks were as good as, if not better than, the movies themselves. From Boomerang to Above the Rim to Waiting to Exhale, black movie soundtracks came, saw and conquered. Just last weekend, I got into a full debate about the best black movie soundtrack, though we included blaxploitation movies, so of course the soundtracks for Superfly and The Mack were name-checked. Dear The Mack, I choose you. See what I did there?\n\nSince the \u201990s, though, short of a few movies here and there like Brown Sugar and Love & Basketball, black movies haven\u2019t been as heavily soundtrack-focused as they used to be. You can chalk that up to the fact that the black movie market, while thriving on an independent level\u2014shouts to Amazon Prime and Netflix\u2014isn\u2019t as commercially poppin\u2019 as it once was outside of Tyler Perry, T.D. Jakes (occasionally) and Spike Lee.\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been a movie, in all honesty, that really lent itself to dedicating an entire soundtrack of new material to it. T.I. made his 2006 classic album, King, the de facto soundtrack for the movie ATL. Jay-Z did something similar with American Gangster, but it just hasn\u2019t been the same since Snoop came through and crushed the buildings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnter Black Panther, the movie that has black folks across America forgetting that we\u2019re all about to make Mickey Mouse a whole lot of money and he will not be fixing the hood in the process. Like most black folks, I\u2019m excited for this movie, and I was waiting for this soundtrack to drop because, I mean, we got us a black movie with a black soundtrack again. In Black History Month, no less. This couldn\u2019t get any blacker unless Allen Iverson\u2019s mother started braiding his hair at the movie theater while he watched Black Panther.\n\nSo what about the actual soundtrack, P?\n\nOh, right. With Kung Fu Kenny (Kendrick Lamar) quarterbacking the project, it features lots of names you know and many you probably don\u2019t. More than half of the TDE roster shows up (Kendrick, Ab-Soul, Jay Rock, Schoolboy Q and SZA), and current heavy hitters like the Weeknd, Travis Scott, 2 Chainz, James Blake, Anderson .Paak, Vince Staples, Khalid and Swae Lee from Rae Sremmurd show up alongside lesser-known but talented artists like Zacari and Jorja Smith.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo is this a good soundtrack? Seems like that depends on whom you ask. My first few runs through the project\u2014at this point, I\u2019ve listened to it roughly six times\u2014is that it\u2019s fair to middling. \u201cAll the Stars\u201d is head and tails the best song on the album, so it\u2019s not surprising that it was the single. I like a few other songs, like \u201cThe Ways,\u201d \u201cRedemption,\u201d \u201cSeasons,\u201d \u201cBig Shot\u201d and \u201cX.\u201d \u201cX\u201d took repeated listens, so I\u2019m not sure if I actually like it or if I\u2019ve been incepted. I don\u2019t care much for the rest of the songs. One run through social media might have you believing that I\u2019m sniffin\u2019 glue, though. I don\u2019t sniff glue, by the way.\n\nObviously it\u2019s too early to tell how this will fare in the black-movie-soundtrack pantheon. Plus, making it over the Above the Rim mountain is almost an impossibility. I think the sound of the project as a whole is interesting; Sounwave really made his presence felt. But I think our soundtracks from the \u201990s were so iconic and we have so much nostalgia built into them that I\u2019m getting misty-eyed thinking about the Sunset Park soundtrack, and I can\u2019t name more than two songs off of it from memory (at the moment).\n\nBut we pretty much got another Kendrick Lamar album, and that\u2019s never a bad thing. The themes are interesting, to say the least, because of what the movie seems to be about, and there are several places on this album that are fairly standard-issue trap-nigga fare. Not sure how that fits with the theme of Black Panther, but I haven\u2019t seen it yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLargely though, it\u2019s good to have a movie, especially one with as big a budget and as much commercial appeal as Black Panther, get the black-movie-soundtrack treatment.

So, imagine our surprise that one of the most melanin-rich presentations of the season almost escaped our notice: Maki Oh, by Nigerian designer Amaka Osakwe.\n\n\n\nBased in Lagos, Osakwe\u2019s been at the helm of her own label since 2010, and since that time has become one of the few Nigerian designers to have a global reach. Her designs have been worn by Beyonc\u00e9, Kerry Washington, and our forever First Lady, Michelle Obama.\n\nThis season, Osakwe sent her models down the runway in a range of muted hues and quirky but sophisticated silhouettes and pattern combinations that seemed to evoke a type of nomadic chic. These immensely wearable clothes are for a woman who is not only worldly but winsome, featuring wonderfully cut trousers, satiny slip-like pieces under suiting fabrics, and lam\u00e9 coats that I\u2019m literally swooning over. (Seriously. Gimme.)\n\nBut what was perhaps most beautiful about Maki Oh\u2019s presentation was that her models were all women of color, in all shades of color, seeming to represent the entirety of the African diaspora itself\u2014with their natural hair textures, no less!\n\nIt was a refreshing, almost matter-of-fact occurrence, and consistent with Osakwe\u2019s castings over her last few seasons. But during a week when black representation has long been a struggle, it felt like a definite boost for the home team. Like her contemporaries Pyer Moss and LaQuan Smith, Osakwe did not shy away from making sure the world knows that we, too, are fashion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnjoy some #BlackGirlMagic at Maki Oh.", "keywords": ["blackgirlmagical", "models", "black", "bnyfw", "color", "season", "osakwe", "oh", "nigerian", "week", "fashion", "label", "maki", "osakwes"], "polarity": 0.1882652280379553, "subjectivity": 0.4920569329660239},

If you have enough people, you are guaranteed to have several who can\u2019t play\u2014perhaps you can do a social good and hold a spades beginners course.

Have a big-ass Black Card Revoked party.\n\nConsidering that you\u2019re not watching the Super Bowl, likely in the name of blackness, this could be interesting, seeing as how you JUST might find out how bad at blackness some of your friends are. Somebody you know has the game plus all of the expansion packs (I\u2019m that guy\u2014or was until I left them in the capital of African America, Atlanta). This can be a fun way to revel in blackness while ignoring the television, unless it\u2019s showing I Am Not Your Negro.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Watch I Am Not Your Negro.\n\nThe documentary on James Baldwin just came on PBS the other night, so somebody DVRed it. I forgot to do so, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a heart in the house tonight who wouldn\u2019t mind hosting as long as somebody brings the right amounts of foodstuffs\u2014and nobody is gonna have to pay. Then have everybody sit around and discuss the film and Baldwin, and for shits and giggles, see how many of your friends can actually NAME a book or play written by Baldwin. They should win a prize.\n\n6. Make it a karaoke night.\n\nSince everybody else will be watching the Super Bowl, why not rent out a room at a karaoke spot and screech your way through three or four hours of top 40 singles with drinks.

Richard Collins III by a white supremacist; and the deafening silence about racism at the U.S. Air Force Academy are just a few examples in the last year.\n\nIt is often worse for black women in the armed forces who are victims of racial and sexual violence. Consider the case of LaVena Johnson, who, at 19 years old, was found dead of a gunshot wound in a tent in Balad, Iraq. Yet despite her body being found with a broken nose, a black eye, loose teeth and corrosive chemicals found on her genitals, the Army determined that her death was a suicide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere else in the world are black women\u2019s bodies, even when dedicated to the protection of a nation, so degraded or devalued? Apparently, the Israeli government isn\u2019t far behind America.\n\nFeb. 21 will mark the three-year anniversary of 19-year-old Cpl. Toveet Radcliffe\u2019s death, the first African-American woman to die in the Israeli Defense Forces. Radcliffe was found dead at Palmachim Airbase just south of Tel Aviv, Israel, from a gunshot wound to the head. In early February, the IDF ruled that Radcliffe\u2019s case will not be reopened. Investigators ruled that the gunshot that went through her forehead and came out the back was a result of an accidental or intentional suicide. However, Radcliffe\u2019s family and members of the African Hebrew Israelite community aren\u2019t so sure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToveet Radcliffe was born in Israel to African-American parents who moved to there to practice as Hebrew Israelites, an Afrocentric form of Old Testament Judaism. She grew up happy and popular in the southern Israeli city of Dimona, where about 10 percent of the population are Hebrew Israelites, and she was known for her beauty and gregarious personality.\n\n\n\nDespite being born in Israel, Radcliffe was not a practicing Hebrew Israelite; nor was she an Israeli citizen. In fact, Hebrew Israelites are not automatically granted Israeli citizenship; the Israeli government had tried to kick them out of the country for years (part of a larger problem of the Israeli government\u2019s discrimination against African and African-American Jews) until eventually granting them a tenuous residency status. Hebrew Israelites often live as second-class citizens, denied public education and state health care because their practice of Judaism isn\u2019t \u201corthodox.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNevertheless, children can earn citizenship for themselves, and their families can become eligible to apply for full citizenship after serving a tour in the armed forces. Radcliffe joined the military in October 2013 and died barely a year into her service\u2014not from terrorists or criminals but from a bullet wound to the head while sitting in a guard booth.\n\nShe was found just after midnight, bleeding from a head wound, by the soldier who was to replace her on duty; she was declared dead by a military doctor less than half an hour later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter almost three years of legal wrangling, Judge Major Meir Vigiser ruled it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that no other person was with Radcliffe when she was shot. Vigiser rejected several experts presented by the Radcliffe family suggesting foul play, instead placing the young woman\u2019s death in her own hands.\n\nAbout 30 members of the Hebrew Israelite community, all wearing white, sat in the courtroom for over an hour, listening to Vigiser\u2019s ruling. Radcliffe\u2019s mother, Khydijah Gray, refused to attend the final hearing because she doubted that justice would come. While the verdict clearly disappointed the Radcliffe family and its supporters, it did not shock them.\n\n\u201cI am absolutely not surprised. I would have been surprised if they had done the right thing,\u201d Shayarah Baht Yisrael said to The Root.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think the whole investigation was flawed from the beginning. And that alone is jail time, as far as I\u2019m concerned. The fact that they tried to sweep it under the rug so quickly, I\u2019m very, very frustrated by that,\u201d Ketreyah Fouch said.\n\nAs supporters from the community trailed out of the Bar Lev Base, one young woman told The Root: \u201cToveet was too good to serve in the Israeli army, in general. Like all of us, we\u2019re just too good to serve in this army.\u201d\n\nHours after attending the court session, African Hebrew activist Ashriel Ben-Israel uploaded a video to Facebook calling the verdict \u201ca big embarrassment\u201d: \u201cWe do not accept it, this decision! We no longer believe any army representative regarding this case,\u201d Ben-Israel bellowed in Hebrew, overcome with emotion. \u201cWe will not allow this decision to pass in silence,\u201d he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiscrepancies in the IDF\u2019s account of her death disturbed Radcliffe\u2019s family and friends from the start. On Jan. 18, 2016, nearly a year after the fatal incident, the IDF published the results of its internal investigation into Radliffe\u2019s death\u2014essentially suicide. At the most basic level, it is hard to believe that 5-foot-2-inch Toveet Radcliffe managed to shoot herself through the forehead with an M4 (demonstrated below with a paper replica by her sister).\n\nGiven that the Israeli government offered to pay the Radcliffe family a lifelong stipend (for a solider who committed suicide), the questionable investigation (significant physical evidence was never examined), and the dismissal of key witnesses and testimony, Radcliffe\u2019s family sought the truth. The Hebrew Israelite community raised funds for a legal appeal that bore fruit a year later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn March 17, 2017, the president of the IDF Court of Appeals, Maj. Gen. Doron Feiles, ordered a reinvestigation of Radcliffe\u2019s death. In his decision, Feiles conceded that the IDF had not definitively demonstrated that Radcliffe had committed suicide and had not even bothered to seriously consider any other possible explanation for her death.\n\n\u201cIt could be that the IDF felt that Toveet\u2019s life wasn\u2019t of value on the scale of social importance. Maybe in its opinion, she was just a girl from a black community in Dimona, just some unimportant girl,\u201d the community leadership said the day after the Vigiser verdict in a press release. \u201cTaking into account the apathy, arrogance and total lack of transparency on the part of the IDF, it must be seen as suspect No. 1.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRadcliffe\u2019s case had become a national story in Israel over the last few year; it was featured in several CSI/The First 48-style TV investigative shows. Yet despite the historic nature of a black girl with African-American parents dying mysteriously in the IDF, it received little or no coverage in the United States. No major news stories, no #SayHerName hashtags. A Change.org petition to President Barack Obama in 2016 on her behalf couldn\u2019t muster 1,000 signatures.\n\nWith the case officially over, members of the Hebrew Israelite community vow that they will continue the fight even if it\u2019s unclear how that will occur. The Israeli government can delay, deny or possibly void the citizenship of community members who push back too hard. Furthermore, with little or no international attention or pressure, \u00e0 la #BringBackOurGirls, there\u2019s no reason to believe that the conservative Benjamin Netanyahu government would even care.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean her case doesn\u2019t matter; it only means that if black lives truly matter across the globe, we must add Toveet Radcliffe\u2019s name to the sadly growing list of black people betrayed, abandoned and possibly killed by their governments.", "keywords": ["toveet", "israeli", "isnt", "black", "death", "military", "ruled", "community", "sayhername", "radcliffe", "idf", "hebrew", "radcliffes", "suicide", "case", "woman", "family"], "polarity": -0.026468473655973653, "subjectivity": 0.42963757179034956},

According to GoFundMe, some 100 campaigns have raised over $100,000 just to help kids across the nation see Black Panther next month.\n\nCelebrities have also noticed the movement over the past few weeks, with several, including Jemele Hill, Snoop Dogg, Chelsea Clinton and so many more, socializing their support and offering contributions.\n\nMost recently, Queen Mother Viola Davis has also joined the challenge, choosing to help send 200 kids from Austin, Texas, to see the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe impact of one small act of kindness is profound. But what makes the pot even sweeter? Well, Joseph appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Monday alongside Black Panther himself, Chadwick Boseman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the show, DeGeneres was the latest celebrity to join the cause, pledging to cover the cost of the Black Panther screening for the Boys & Girls Club. The $42,000 raised in the GoFundMe will now be donated directly to the organization to support other programs within the group. Joseph responded with this statement:\n\nI can\u2019t thank Ellen enough. She generously helped me and she covered the cost of the Black Panther screening for the kids in Harlem. All children deserve to believe they can save the world, go on exciting adventures, or accomplish the impossible. I am grateful that all of you have answered the call and are taking action to help more kids watch their heroes on the big screen. Let\u2019s keep pushing forward. I am paying it forward and will donate to 10 campaigns, and I hope everyone joins the #BlackPantherChallenge and donates to or creates a GoFundMe in your city.\n\nDeGeneres also presented Joseph with a cool $20,000 for himself in order to help the marketing consultant personally.", "keywords": ["help", "support", "celebrities", "black", "panther", "joseph", "gofundme", "chipping", "blackpantherchallenge", "taken", "kids", "campaigns", "storm", "youre", "harlem", "internet"], "polarity": 0.13303030303030294, "subjectivity": 0.48621212121212126},

So, imagine our surprise that one of the most melanin-rich presentations of the season almost escaped our notice: Maki Oh, by Nigerian designer Amaka Osakwe.\n\n\n\nBased in Lagos, Osakwe\u2019s been at the helm of her own label since 2010, and since that time has become one of the few Nigerian designers to have a global reach. Her designs have been worn by Beyonc\u00e9, Kerry Washington, and our forever First Lady, Michelle Obama.\n\nThis season, Osakwe sent her models down the runway in a range of muted hues and quirky but sophisticated silhouettes and pattern combinations that seemed to evoke a type of nomadic chic. These immensely wearable clothes are for a woman who is not only worldly but winsome, featuring wonderfully cut trousers, satiny slip-like pieces under suiting fabrics, and lam\u00e9 coats that I\u2019m literally swooning over. (Seriously. Gimme.)\n\nBut what was perhaps most beautiful about Maki Oh\u2019s presentation was that her models were all women of color, in all shades of color, seeming to represent the entirety of the African diaspora itself\u2014with their natural hair textures, no less!\n\nIt was a refreshing, almost matter-of-fact occurrence, and consistent with Osakwe\u2019s castings over her last few seasons. But during a week when black representation has long been a struggle, it felt like a definite boost for the home team. Like her contemporaries Pyer Moss and LaQuan Smith, Osakwe did not shy away from making sure the world knows that we, too, are fashion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnjoy some #BlackGirlMagic at Maki Oh.", "keywords": ["blackgirlmagical", "models", "black", "bnyfw", "color", "season", "osakwe", "oh", "nigerian", "week", "fashion", "label", "maki", "osakwes"], "polarity": 0.1882652280379553, "subjectivity": 0.4920569329660239},

And she does!\n\nIn her latest role, in Proud Mary, Henson plays Mary, a bad-ass mother and assassin.

President Donald Trump\u2019s handling of the death of Army Sgt. LaDavid Johnson; the White House\u2019s silence on the killing of Army 2nd Lt. Richard Collins III by a white supremacist; and the deafening silence about racism at the U.S. Air Force Academy are just a few examples in the last year.\n\nIt is often worse for black women in the armed forces who are victims of racial and sexual violence. Consider the case of LaVena Johnson, who, at 19 years old, was found dead of a gunshot wound in a tent in Balad, Iraq. Yet despite her body being found with a broken nose, a black eye, loose teeth and corrosive chemicals found on her genitals, the Army determined that her death was a suicide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere else in the world are black women\u2019s bodies, even when dedicated to the protection of a nation, so degraded or devalued? Apparently, the Israeli government isn\u2019t far behind America.\n\nFeb. 21 will mark the three-year anniversary of 19-year-old Cpl. Toveet Radcliffe\u2019s death, the first African-American woman to die in the Israeli Defense Forces. Radcliffe was found dead at Palmachim Airbase just south of Tel Aviv, Israel, from a gunshot wound to the head. In early February, the IDF ruled that Radcliffe\u2019s case will not be reopened. Investigators ruled that the gunshot that went through her forehead and came out the back was a result of an accidental or intentional suicide. However, Radcliffe\u2019s family and members of the African Hebrew Israelite community aren\u2019t so sure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToveet Radcliffe was born in Israel to African-American parents who moved to there to practice as Hebrew Israelites, an Afrocentric form of Old Testament Judaism. She grew up happy and popular in the southern Israeli city of Dimona, where about 10 percent of the population are Hebrew Israelites, and she was known for her beauty and gregarious personality.\n\n\n\nDespite being born in Israel, Radcliffe was not a practicing Hebrew Israelite; nor was she an Israeli citizen. In fact, Hebrew Israelites are not automatically granted Israeli citizenship; the Israeli government had tried to kick them out of the country for years (part of a larger problem of the Israeli government\u2019s discrimination against African and African-American Jews) until eventually granting them a tenuous residency status. Hebrew Israelites often live as second-class citizens, denied public education and state health care because their practice of Judaism isn\u2019t \u201corthodox.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNevertheless, children can earn citizenship for themselves, and their families can become eligible to apply for full citizenship after serving a tour in the armed forces. Radcliffe joined the military in October 2013 and died barely a year into her service\u2014not from terrorists or criminals but from a bullet wound to the head while sitting in a guard booth.\n\nShe was found just after midnight, bleeding from a head wound, by the soldier who was to replace her on duty; she was declared dead by a military doctor less than half an hour later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter almost three years of legal wrangling, Judge Major Meir Vigiser ruled it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that no other person was with Radcliffe when she was shot. Vigiser rejected several experts presented by the Radcliffe family suggesting foul play, instead placing the young woman\u2019s death in her own hands.\n\nAbout 30 members of the Hebrew Israelite community, all wearing white, sat in the courtroom for over an hour, listening to Vigiser\u2019s ruling. Radcliffe\u2019s mother, Khydijah Gray, refused to attend the final hearing because she doubted that justice would come. While the verdict clearly disappointed the Radcliffe family and its supporters, it did not shock them.\n\n\u201cI am absolutely not surprised. I would have been surprised if they had done the right thing,\u201d Shayarah Baht Yisrael said to The Root.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think the whole investigation was flawed from the beginning. And that alone is jail time, as far as I\u2019m concerned. The fact that they tried to sweep it under the rug so quickly, I\u2019m very, very frustrated by that,\u201d Ketreyah Fouch said.\n\nAs supporters from the community trailed out of the Bar Lev Base, one young woman told The Root: \u201cToveet was too good to serve in the Israeli army, in general. Like all of us, we\u2019re just too good to serve in this army.\u201d\n\nHours after attending the court session, African Hebrew activist Ashriel Ben-Israel uploaded a video to Facebook calling the verdict \u201ca big embarrassment\u201d: \u201cWe do not accept it, this decision! We no longer believe any army representative regarding this case,\u201d Ben-Israel bellowed in Hebrew, overcome with emotion. \u201cWe will not allow this decision to pass in silence,\u201d he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiscrepancies in the IDF\u2019s account of her death disturbed Radcliffe\u2019s family and friends from the start. On Jan. 18, 2016, nearly a year after the fatal incident, the IDF published the results of its internal investigation into Radliffe\u2019s death\u2014essentially suicide. At the most basic level, it is hard to believe that 5-foot-2-inch Toveet Radcliffe managed to shoot herself through the forehead with an M4 (demonstrated below with a paper replica by her sister).\n\nGiven that the Israeli government offered to pay the Radcliffe family a lifelong stipend (for a solider who committed suicide), the questionable investigation (significant physical evidence was never examined), and the dismissal of key witnesses and testimony, Radcliffe\u2019s family sought the truth. The Hebrew Israelite community raised funds for a legal appeal that bore fruit a year later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn March 17, 2017, the president of the IDF Court of Appeals, Maj. Gen. Doron Feiles, ordered a reinvestigation of Radcliffe\u2019s death. In his decision, Feiles conceded that the IDF had not definitively demonstrated that Radcliffe had committed suicide and had not even bothered to seriously consider any other possible explanation for her death.\n\n\u201cIt could be that the IDF felt that Toveet\u2019s life wasn\u2019t of value on the scale of social importance. Maybe in its opinion, she was just a girl from a black community in Dimona, just some unimportant girl,\u201d the community leadership said the day after the Vigiser verdict in a press release. \u201cTaking into account the apathy, arrogance and total lack of transparency on the part of the IDF, it must be seen as suspect No. 1.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRadcliffe\u2019s case had become a national story in Israel over the last few year; it was featured in several CSI/The First 48-style TV investigative shows. Yet despite the historic nature of a black girl with African-American parents dying mysteriously in the IDF, it received little or no coverage in the United States. No major news stories, no #SayHerName hashtags. A Change.org petition to President Barack Obama in 2016 on her behalf couldn\u2019t muster 1,000 signatures.\n\nWith the case officially over, members of the Hebrew Israelite community vow that they will continue the fight even if it\u2019s unclear how that will occur. The Israeli government can delay, deny or possibly void the citizenship of community members who push back too hard. Furthermore, with little or no international attention or pressure, \u00e0 la #BringBackOurGirls, there\u2019s no reason to believe that the conservative Benjamin Netanyahu government would even care.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean her case doesn\u2019t matter; it only means that if black lives truly matter across the globe, we must add Toveet Radcliffe\u2019s name to the sadly growing list of black people betrayed, abandoned and possibly killed by their governments.", "keywords": ["toveet", "israeli", "isnt", "black", "death", "military", "ruled", "community", "sayhername", "radcliffe", "idf", "hebrew", "radcliffes", "suicide", "case", "woman", "family"], "polarity": -0.026468473655973653, "subjectivity": 0.42963757179034956},

And how about an \u00fcber-talented hairdresser like Tym Wallace scrutinizing your every move via a super-closeup iPhone app for moviemakers? You would be flawless, that\u2019s what. Don\u2019t take my word for it, though; see for yourself when Proud Mary,\n\nTaraji P. Henson\u2019s latest star vehicle, hits the big screen today, Friday, Jan. 12.\n\nTo celebrate the film\u2019s release\u2014and all things hair\u2014Wallace, along with hair-care brand Creme of Nature, recently hosted a bevy of beauty editors in the penthouse suite of 60 Thompson, a sexy little boutique hotel in New York City\u2019s SoHo neighborhood.\n\nChampagne and high tea were served while Wallace\u2014who had just wrapped a publicity shoot in the adjacent suite of rooms\u2014emerged and took his place at the center of the circle to tell the tale of how he built the hair story for Henson\u2019s titular role as Mary. \u201cNot since Pam Grier have we seen a role like this on film,\u201d he said.\n\nClad in all black, with a razor-sharp brushed fade and a flute of Champagne at the end of his Yakuza sleeve-tattooed arm, he proceeded to hold court with a nod to the current national mood: \u201cIt\u2019s great to see women taking their power back,\u201d declared Wallace as the room raised their glasses in agreement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWallace\u2019s reading of the script for Proud Mary, directed by Babak Najafi, led him to create hairstyles so closely interwoven with the plot that he could scarcely reveal the number of hair changes, for fear of spoiler alerts. Wallace explained, \u201cContract killers move in mystery and in silence\u2014the outside world is not supposed to know the personality of a killer.\u201d\n\nThe role had many challenges: creating a look that was simultaneously fly, incognito and capable of standing up to the physical demands of Henson performing many of her own stunts. Wallace\u2019s tactic was simple: \u201cKeep it minimal,\u201d killing it with a series of high-end human-hair wigs.\n\nTo hold those $575-a-piece human-hair wigs in place during filming, his adhesive of choice was spirit gum, specifically from WM Creations in its matte finish. Wallace, who has been looking after Henson\u2019s tresses since the two met in 2015, does not like using glue for wigs; he feels it damages the hair and doesn\u2019t clean up easily with 99 percent alcohol, the way spirit gum does. He\u2019s a fan of buying French hairpins by the pound to secure wigs and pieces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo matter what you\u2019re doing with your hair, Wallace maintains that edge care is a major issue\u2014certainly, removing and regluing wigs twice a day takes its toll. His No. 1 weapon in the war on edge erosion is his own \u201cspecial concoction\u201d of oils, including Jamaican black castor, jojoba, tea tree and coconut oils, adding a dash of lavender oil to neutralize the smell of the castor oil.\n\nAs for working with Henson, Wallace says she\u2019s the kind of client \u201cI prayed for. She\u2019s hilarious and she lets me do anything and everything to her hair.\u201d But one thing Wallace won\u2019t do is leave a weave in longer than two months without taking it out for a one-week breather and mandatory maintenance, which always includes trimming split ends. \u201cOne bad petal kills a whole flower; same for split ends in your hair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also cautions against braiding hair too tightly, citing an epidemic of traction alopecia he\u2019s been seeing lately, due to braiders who are so deft at their craft they can \u201ccatch and braid your eyebrows!\u201d\u2014a truth that made the room erupt in laughter. But Wallace got serious as he slid his signature glasses down his nose, peering sincerely at the editors gathered: \u201cTell your braider not to touch your edges, and give those braids some slack.\u201d\n\nFor everyday edge care, he advises using edge-taming products that don\u2019t list alcohol as the No. 1 ingredient. He also swears by tinted gels to boost the shine and luster of edges, giving that extra touch of #BlackGirlMagic. According to the Wallace gospel\u2014where hair is a \u201crelatable form of ministry\u201d\u2014tips for maintaining straight hair include using leave-in conditioner and heat-protectant products.\n\nNow in his 12th year as a hairdresser, he\u2019s happy to see that so many women have had a come-to-Jesus moment and joined the natural-hair movement. Says Wallace: \u201cWe have the best hair in the world. It does everything.

I would have been surprised if they had done the right thing,\u201d Shayarah Baht Yisrael said to The Root.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think the whole investigation was flawed from the beginning. And that alone is jail time, as far as I\u2019m concerned. The fact that they tried to sweep it under the rug so quickly, I\u2019m very, very frustrated by that,\u201d Ketreyah Fouch said.\n\nAs supporters from the community trailed out of the Bar Lev Base, one young woman told The Root: \u201cToveet was too good to serve in the Israeli army, in general. Like all of us, we\u2019re just too good to serve in this army.\u201d\n\nHours after attending the court session, African Hebrew activist Ashriel Ben-Israel uploaded a video to Facebook calling the verdict \u201ca big embarrassment\u201d: \u201cWe do not accept it, this decision! We no longer believe any army representative regarding this case,\u201d Ben-Israel bellowed in Hebrew, overcome with emotion. \u201cWe will not allow this decision to pass in silence,\u201d he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiscrepancies in the IDF\u2019s account of her death disturbed Radcliffe\u2019s family and friends from the start. On Jan. 18, 2016, nearly a year after the fatal incident, the IDF published the results of its internal investigation into Radliffe\u2019s death\u2014essentially suicide. At the most basic level, it is hard to believe that 5-foot-2-inch Toveet Radcliffe managed to shoot herself through the forehead with an M4 (demonstrated below with a paper replica by her sister).\n\nGiven that the Israeli government offered to pay the Radcliffe family a lifelong stipend (for a solider who committed suicide), the questionable investigation (significant physical evidence was never examined), and the dismissal of key witnesses and testimony, Radcliffe\u2019s family sought the truth. The Hebrew Israelite community raised funds for a legal appeal that bore fruit a year later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn March 17, 2017, the president of the IDF Court of Appeals, Maj. Gen. Doron Feiles, ordered a reinvestigation of Radcliffe\u2019s death. In his decision, Feiles conceded that the IDF had not definitively demonstrated that Radcliffe had committed suicide and had not even bothered to seriously consider any other possible explanation for her death.\n\n\u201cIt could be that the IDF felt that Toveet\u2019s life wasn\u2019t of value on the scale of social importance. Maybe in its opinion, she was just a girl from a black community in Dimona, just some unimportant girl,\u201d the community leadership said the day after the Vigiser verdict in a press release. \u201cTaking into account the apathy, arrogance and total lack of transparency on the part of the IDF, it must be seen as suspect No. 1.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRadcliffe\u2019s case had become a national story in Israel over the last few year; it was featured in several CSI/The First 48-style TV investigative shows. Yet despite the historic nature of a black girl with African-American parents dying mysteriously in the IDF, it received little or no coverage in the United States. No major news stories, no #SayHerName hashtags. A Change.org petition to President Barack Obama in 2016 on her behalf couldn\u2019t muster 1,000 signatures.\n\nWith the case officially over, members of the Hebrew Israelite community vow that they will continue the fight even if it\u2019s unclear how that will occur. The Israeli government can delay, deny or possibly void the citizenship of community members who push back too hard. Furthermore, with little or no international attention or pressure, \u00e0 la #BringBackOurGirls, there\u2019s no reason to believe that the conservative Benjamin Netanyahu government would even care.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean her case doesn\u2019t matter; it only means that if black lives truly matter across the globe, we must add Toveet Radcliffe\u2019s name to the sadly growing list of black people betrayed, abandoned and possibly killed by their governments.", "keywords": ["toveet", "israeli", "isnt", "black", "death", "military", "ruled", "community", "sayhername", "radcliffe", "idf", "hebrew", "radcliffes", "suicide", "case", "woman", "family"], "polarity": -0.026468473655973653, "subjectivity": 0.42963757179034956},

So, imagine our surprise that one of the most melanin-rich presentations of the season almost escaped our notice: Maki Oh, by Nigerian designer Amaka Osakwe.\n\n\n\nBased in Lagos, Osakwe\u2019s been at the helm of her own label since 2010, and since that time has become one of the few Nigerian designers to have a global reach. Her designs have been worn by Beyonc\u00e9, Kerry Washington, and our forever First Lady, Michelle Obama.\n\nThis season, Osakwe sent her models down the runway in a range of muted hues and quirky but sophisticated silhouettes and pattern combinations that seemed to evoke a type of nomadic chic. These immensely wearable clothes are for a woman who is not only worldly but winsome, featuring wonderfully cut trousers, satiny slip-like pieces under suiting fabrics, and lam\u00e9 coats that I\u2019m literally swooning over. (Seriously. Gimme.)\n\nBut what was perhaps most beautiful about Maki Oh\u2019s presentation was that her models were all women of color, in all shades of color, seeming to represent the entirety of the African diaspora itself\u2014with their natural hair textures, no less!\n\nIt was a refreshing, almost matter-of-fact occurrence, and consistent with Osakwe\u2019s castings over her last few seasons. But during a week when black representation has long been a struggle, it felt like a definite boost for the home team. Like her contemporaries Pyer Moss and LaQuan Smith, Osakwe did not shy away from making sure the world knows that we, too, are fashion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnjoy some #BlackGirlMagic at Maki Oh.", "keywords": ["blackgirlmagical", "models", "black", "bnyfw", "color", "season", "osakwe", "oh", "nigerian", "week", "fashion", "label", "maki", "osakwes"], "polarity": 0.1882652280379553, "subjectivity": 0.4920569329660239},

Then she learned more about the hardships black filmmakers face getting their content picked up by streaming services. She quickly realized that there wasn\u2019t a lack of content, but a void of platforms. So she figured: Why not create one?\n\nSoon after, KweliTV was formed.\n\nThe streaming platform, similar to Netflix or Hulu, allows monthly subscribers unlimited access to more than 200 indie films from nearly 150 creatives across Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as black communities in Europe and North America. The goal is for KweliTV (kweli means \u201ctruth\u201d in Swahili) to give emerging independent creatives an opportunity to get their work shown\u2014especially to the audiences who look like them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also an opportunity for us to just learn more about each other,\u201d she says. \u201cAs black people in the U.S., we should be able to learn about Trinidad, or South Africa or Brazil through media arts, and that\u2019s what KweliTV strives to do.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter two years, KweliTV boasts more than 2,000 monthly, paid subscribers and nearly 20,000 online members\u2014and those numbers continue to climb. For black visual artists struggling to move beyond small film festivals, it\u2019s a much-needed avenue for securing additional viewership.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t that many avenues for nonwhite, independent filmmakers to be seen, so KweliTV has the potential to be a game changer for those of us who have struggled finding places to showcase our work,\u201d says Charysse Tia Harper, a longtime filmmaker with three films on KweliTV, including a look at Trinidad\u2019s carnival and a documentary on one man\u2019s mission to offer one family $1-per-month housing for a year.\n\n\u201cKweli allows us to celebrate who we are and our diversity while showing off what our emerging creators in the Diaspora can do,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom challenging all-white award shows to the lack of diversity among executives, Hollywood\u2019s boxing out of black cinema is no secret. According to a 2016 study (pdf) from the Media, Diversity & Social Change Initiative at the USC Annenberg School, of the 100 top-grossing films of 2016, 47 had no black or African-American actors. And just 5.6 percent of the 900 films analyzed since 2007 were led by a black or African-American director.\n\nStreaming services, while providing more opportunities for mainstream viewership, have not been nearly as much of a reprieve for budding black filmmakers as many might have hoped. Not only have platforms like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon.com faced backlash for whitewashing minority characters, but many filmmakers say it\u2019s still much harder for black creators to get streaming services to buy in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhile it hasn\u2019t always been my personal experience, just like any profession, black filmmakers often have to work twice as hard,\u201d Harper says, \u201cand with streaming services, the cost alone for them to host your content can box a lot of filmmakers of color out.\u201d\n\nBut Spencer is quick to clarify that KweliTV isn\u2019t a dumping ground for projects rejected by mainstream platforms. She and her team of four screen up to five films a week, using strict guidelines, before projects ever appear on the site.\n\n\u201cGenerally our criteria is that the project has to have been screened in a least one film festival, or some type of peer review,\u201d she says. \u201cBut even then we review films to make sure they fit what KweliTV is trying to do: be a catalyst for underrepresented perspectives in black media to be seen and heard.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat means subscribers will likely never see reality TV, melodramatic stage plays or other content that Spencer says \u201cperpetuates dangerous stereotypes of black people,\u201d whether it be excessive documentaries on violence in Latin America, poverty on the African continent or gangster films in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\u201cHollywood provides enough of that,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to show there\u2019s more to us than these predictable narratives. We want character, not caricatures.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGetting KweliTV off the ground hasn\u2019t been easy. The company is still mostly made up of a small team of dedicated producers and filmmakers united in their mission. Spencer herself says that she invests her own salary back into the company. But with KweliTV\u2019s popularity soaring, Spencer is thinking several steps ahead.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe want to eventually have our own awards entity that specifically recognizes excellence in black independent films,\u201d she says. \u201cRight now, you pretty much expect that any mainstream film with a majority-black cast or audience is going to be nominated for staple black awards, whether it\u2019s Soul Train, BET or NAACP Image Awards. But there\u2019s little out there that recognizes our own independent artists.\u201d\n\nAnd while she\u2019s flattered by the Netflix comparisons, Spencer says \u201cthe black Netflix\u201d is not a moniker she chooses to embrace. She likens Netflix to a modern-day Blockbuster, merely a vessel that houses content, whereas KweliTV attempts to immerse everyone within a community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBesides,\u201d she adds, \u201cbeing \u2018the black\u2019 anything isn\u2019t really a compliment. We\u2019re better off when we recognize that being black is enough.

But as she tells Allure in its March issue, her own journey to choosing to wear her hair in its natural state was a very different one from the almost instantaneous success she enjoyed after being cast in her Oscar-winning role in 12 Years a Slave.\n\nAs a tween in Kenya, Nyong\u2019o was teased and felt \u201creally unpretty\u201d in comparison with her classmates\u2014who almost all wore their hair relaxed. Her mother wanted her to wait until near adulthood to relax her hair but eventually acquiesced to her daughter\u2019s pleas. Nyong\u2019o explains:\n\nShe took me to the salon in the middle of the school day, and I got my hair relaxed. I felt so much better because it was easier to tame. All the girls in my class had their hair relaxed. Very few had natural kink, so I felt a lot more acceptable. I had my hair relaxed for most of my teenage years, and that was a whole other world. The upkeep of relaxed hair is a commitment. It took styling it once a week and then having it retouched once a month. I remember doing crazy things, like sleeping with my head above the headboard so that my curls wouldn\u2019t get messed up for the next day. I\u2019d have these terrible neck aches because I was determined to keep my hair as pristine as possible. And it was super expensive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, Nyongo\u2019s conversion back to natural hair began in response to a joke from her father while she was asking him for money to support her relaxer habit: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just cut it all off?\u201d he said. She did, having her head shaved completely bald, a choice that she told Allure was \u201cliberating.\u201d\n\nBut the choice wasn\u2019t a cure-all; Nyong\u2019o struggled with managing her texture for years, especially after moving to the northeastern United States for college and graduate school:\n\nMoving to the U.S. was very difficult because I didn\u2019t have the same kind of support system. [Braiding] services were not readily available in Amherst, Massachusetts. For a long time I would braid my hair in Kenya and then spend months with the braids in when I got to the States so that I didn\u2019t have to worry about my hair. Also, my hair did something very different in freezing weather, which I didn\u2019t know how to handle. My hair needs moisture. It needs warmth. All of a sudden I was in this very cold environment, and my hair was bristly and dry and really hard to manage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while it was Nyong\u2019o\u2019s work with famed stylist Ted Gibson that got many inspired about the versatility of natural hair, it was her current stylist, Vernon Franc\u0327ois, who helped her learn how to manage and care for her natural texture, thanks in large part to his eponymous line of products/ (Franc\u0327ois also provided some insight and tips on how he created the looks for Nyong\u2019o\u2019s Allure cover shoot.)\n\nNyong\u2019o says:\n\n\n\nOne thing I\u2019ve learned was the acronym LOC, and that\u2019s basically the rule for how to treat my hair: liquid, oil, and then cream. It\u2019s the idea that you wet your hair first, then you add oil so that it can trap the moisture in, then you put a moisturizer or a cream over it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNyong\u2019o says that this is the longest her hair has been in a decade. And while we\u2019re guessing that a few extras were added to create the cloudlike coifs she rocks in Allure\u2019s March issue, we\u2019re liking the look on her.

Originally based on supermodels Naomi Campbell and Tyra Banks, the Dora were initially conceived not only as female warriors but also as potential wives for the king, whom they\u2019ve pledged to protect, along with the royal family. They were the best and strongest women from the 18 villages within Wakanda and trained at the royal palace.\n\nBut while Priest may in part cite supermodels as his inspiration, there is a historical prototype for the Dora Milaje in the Dahomey \u201cAmazons\u201d\u2014so nicknamed by European colonizers and now known by the French-speaking Beninese as the \u201cN\u2019Nonmiton\u201d (which translates to \u201cour mothers\u201d in Fon).\n\nCreated by King Agaja of the West African nation of Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) in the 18th century, the N\u2019Nonmiton were an all-female guard and fighting force, likely inspired by the female hunters known as gbeto. Like the Dora Milaje, the N\u2019Nonmiton were also considered wives of the king, pledging celibacy as well as loyalty and protection to him. And they existed in this role until the colonization of Dahomey in the late 19th century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can learn all about the incredible female warriors of Dahomey in a 2015 episode of the podcast Stuff You Missed in History Class, and in a very comprehensive comic on their history created by UNESCO for its Series on Women in African History (pdf).

But since we here at The Glow Up sit at the intersection of Fashion Week and Black History Month (and Wakanda, obvi), we couldn\u2019t help noticing another trend rising the past few seasons: a surge in blackness-branded clothing we haven\u2019t seen since the early \u201990s (more on that trend to come).\n\n\n\nWhat was really striking to us was the re-emergence of our two primary civil rights icons, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr., as the focus of two clothing lines this season: the Malcolm X Legacy collection, which debuted at Harlem Fashion Week 2018, and recent releases from New York-based skateboarding brand Supreme, whose latest lookbook features clothing emblazoned with MLK\u2019s visage and most famous phrases: \u201cI have a dream\u201d and \u201cWe shall overcome.\u201d\n\nSuffice it to say, reviews on the much-better-known Supreme collection were mixed, especially among The Root crew. Our internal\u2014and anonymous\u2014staff discussions went something like this:\n\n\u201cThis is ridiculous. The King family is a mess for authorizing this.\u201d \u201cCash grab.\u201d \u201cMy beef with it is ... why is it so hideous? It looks like some shit you\u2019d see for sale on the side of the road ... or at a swamp meet.\u201d [Editor\u2019s note: Yes, she meant \u201cswamp.\u201d] \u201cThere will be no Supreme-bashing on my watch ... aka my favorite brand right now. Although I must admit that this morning\u2019s lookbook was sad, and the MLK hoodie was one of the better pieces in a sad way. ... Supreme has honored several blacks in the past, including the great Pam Grier ... Sade, Muhammad Ali, KRS-One, Malcolm X ... MLK fits that mold, even if that all-over print sweatshirt is fugazi.\u201d \u201cThe Sade was fresh. This was a mess. It looked like something I\u2019d be forced to buy if I caught a chill at Jazz Fest ... and I\u2019d stay cold.\u201d \u201cI think MLK on the arms was overkill. Never put MLK on the arms.\u201d \u201cThat sweatshirt was all the velvet paintings and airbrushed backdrops of MLK that ever were.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK. So that release was considered less than \u201csupreme\u201d around these parts. But not to be outdone, the jewel in the crown that was 2018 Harlem Fashion Week was the debut of the Malcolm X Legacy collection, co-helmed by the six daughters of Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz\u2014Qubilah, Attallah, Ilyasah, Malikah, Gamilah and Malaak Shabazz. Instead of simply licensing their father\u2019s words and image to an existing brand, the Shabazz sisters teamed up with tech company Hingeto and emerging designer Yvonne Jewnell to collaborate on a clothing line that pays homage to their father\u2019s legacy.\n\nThe contemporary urbanwear line features clothing inspired by the 12 principles of Malcolm X, which stressed the importance of human rights, education, economic independence, cultural pride and justice. The Shabazz sisters created the collection in hopes of inspiring a younger generation of activists to follow in their father\u2019s steps.\n\nThe Glow Up\u2019s editorial team (supermodel Veronica Webb and myself) had the pleasure of being front row at the debut of the Malcolm X Legacy collection at the inaugural event of Harlem Fashion Week on Feb. 4, a sold-out runway presentation at the gorgeous Museum of the City of New York. We can vouch for the fact that these are definitely clothes for a new generation of Malcolm X followers\u2014fresh, funky, fashion-forward and sexier than expected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while we both enjoyed the presentation, we\u2019ll let you judge for yourselves this round.

So, imagine our surprise that one of the most melanin-rich presentations of the season almost escaped our notice: Maki Oh, by Nigerian designer Amaka Osakwe.\n\n\n\nBased in Lagos, Osakwe\u2019s been at the helm of her own label since 2010, and since that time has become one of the few Nigerian designers to have a global reach. Her designs have been worn by Beyonc\u00e9, Kerry Washington, and our forever First Lady, Michelle Obama.\n\nThis season, Osakwe sent her models down the runway in a range of muted hues and quirky but sophisticated silhouettes and pattern combinations that seemed to evoke a type of nomadic chic. These immensely wearable clothes are for a woman who is not only worldly but winsome, featuring wonderfully cut trousers, satiny slip-like pieces under suiting fabrics, and lam\u00e9 coats that I\u2019m literally swooning over. (Seriously. Gimme.)\n\nBut what was perhaps most beautiful about Maki Oh\u2019s presentation was that her models were all women of color, in all shades of color, seeming to represent the entirety of the African diaspora itself\u2014with their natural hair textures, no less!\n\nIt was a refreshing, almost matter-of-fact occurrence, and consistent with Osakwe\u2019s castings over her last few seasons. But during a week when black representation has long been a struggle, it felt like a definite boost for the home team. Like her contemporaries Pyer Moss and LaQuan Smith, Osakwe did not shy away from making sure the world knows that we, too, are fashion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnjoy some #BlackGirlMagic at Maki Oh.", "keywords": ["blackgirlmagical", "models", "black", "bnyfw", "color", "season", "osakwe", "oh", "nigerian", "week", "fashion", "label", "maki", "osakwes"], "polarity": 0.1882652280379553, "subjectivity": 0.4920569329660239},

The song samples her famous 1966 song \u201cFour Women,\u201d released on the Wild Is the Wind album. For those who were introduced to her through Jay-Z, I\u2019m both happy and sad: happy because at least they were introduced, and sad because that\u2019s a lot of good Nina Simone music they\u2019ve been missing out on.\n\n\u201cFour Women\u201d is one of the most powerful songs I\u2019ve ever heard in my entire life. From the piano riff that runs through the entire song, which is nothing short of heaven-sent in its perfection, to the buildup at the end to punctuate the emotions and the stories of the four women who are the essence of the song, \u201cFour Women\u201d brilliantly shares the various pain and struggles of black womanhood in America, as faced by these four black figures: Aunt Sarah, Saffronia, Sweet Thing and Peaches.\n\nAccording to an old Village Voice piece written by Thulani Davis after Simone passed away in 2003:\n\n\n\nBut it was \u201cFour Women,\u201d an instantly accessible analysis of the damning legacy of slavery, that made iconographic the real women we knew and would become. For African American women it became an anthem affirming our existence, our sanity, and our struggle to survive a culture which regards us as anti-feminine. It acknowledged the loss of childhoods among African American women, our invisibility, exploitation, defiance, and even subtly reminded that in slavery and patriarchy, your name is what they call you.\n\nAs a youth, I\u2019d heard Simone\u2019s music through my own discovery of new artists, but it (admittedly) wasn\u2019t until Kanye West sampled \u201cSinnerman\u201d for Talib Kweli\u2019s \u201cGet By\u201d in 2002 that I did a deep dive into her entire catalog. I spent a week digging into internet crates looking for every album I could find, trying to learn as much as I could.\n\nHer political messaging stood out to me particularly because of the timing and tone of a lot of her music\u2014so much was released in the heat of the civil rights movement\u2014and she didn\u2019t make any bones about her feelings over what was happening in America.\n\nFrom the Washington Post about the creation of the song \u201cMississippi Goddam\u201d:\n\nWhen Nina Simone heard about the bombing death of four young girls at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., in 1963, she famously went to her garage and tried to build a zip gun to take out her anger on someone. When her husband suggested that her music would be a more effective weapon, she wrote \u201cMississippi Goddam,\u201d a politically charged song that declared, \u201cLord have mercy on this land of mine / we all gonna get it in due time.\u201d When she released the song in 1964, it contained this curious, spoken aside: \u201cThis is a show tune, but the show hasn\u2019t been written for it yet.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFour Women\u201d follows along in that political ideology, and from the moment I first heard it, I was drawn into it. It\u2019s almost impossible not to feel something. She electrified us with her storytelling, and influenced other artists\u2014there are plays and works named in honor of the song\u2014by creating offerings that spoke to black womanhood in ways that resonated broadly, but particularly among black women.\n\nHer catalog contains so many gems that one listen through any greatest-hits compilation would whet your appetite for more. From \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Let Me Be Misunderstood\u201d to the aforementioned \u201cSinnerman\u201d and \u201cMississippi Goddam\u201d to \u201cI Put a Spell on You,\u201d you can find almost anything you\u2019re looking for from Nina Simone. She has over 30 albums for your choosing, but even among the many gems, \u201cFour Women\u201d stands out for its impact and purpose.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s why they call her Peaches, the last of the four women:", "keywords": ["introduced", "nina", "simone", "heard", "black", "mississippi", "released", "moments", "simones", "history", "perfect", "song", "music", "women"], "polarity": 0.11215200029855203, "subjectivity": 0.4679047245857591},

In between shooting takes for the now classic Thanksgiving-dinner scene, Eddie Murphy and cast trade jokes about what would happen if Mr. and Mrs. Jackson (John Witherspoon and BeBe Drake) had sex in the bathroom of his character Marcus\u2019s luxurious New York City condo.\n\n\n\nDirector Reginald Hudlin wraps shooting for the week, but he cannot shake the thought: \u201cWhat would happen if the Jacksons had sex in the bathroom?\u201d He imagines all the ways it could be shot, how to make the joke land without being crass, how to use the moment to poke fun at respectability politics and buppydom. He rushes to set the following Monday to find that Murphy has been having the same thoughts. They improv the scene on camera dozens of times, each time funnier than the one before. It\u2019s this black creative synergy that makes Boomerang the FUBU of romantic comedies.\n\nThis summer, Boomerang turns 25. To celebrate, The Root spoke with Hudlin about the film that made every black person in America dream of moving to New York City to work for an all-black company.\n\n\u201cThat period in which Boomerang was made was a period of unapologetic blackness,\u201d Hudlin told The Root. \u201cA black upscale romantic comedy was something that audiences really wanted to see, that they needed to see.\u201d\n\nBoomerang centers on Marcus Graham, an ad executive at Lady Eloise, an all-black cosmetics company. The self-proclaimed \u201cEleganza mack daddy of the month\u201d has a thing for beautiful women with pretty feet\u2014and for mock turtlenecks (I counted 10). Marcus\u2019 life is upended when his new boss, the suave Jacqueline (Robin Givens), flips the supposed gender script and beats the player at his own game. The wounded lothario finds comfort in the arms of Angela (Halle Berry), the pretty, boho-lite art director with a not-so-secret crush on Marcus. After a dramatic breakup\u2014\u00e0 la \u201clove shoulda brought your ass home last night\u201d\u2014Marcus and Angela reconcile and stroll off together into the Lower East Side sunset.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe love triangle involving Jacqueline, Marcus and Angela is actually the least interesting aspect of the movie.\n\nViewers are seduced by the sumptuously black world of the Lady Eloise company and its employees. In their world, life moves to the rhythm of a banging R&B soundtrack. Everyone is fresh dipped in cashmere overcoats, silk blouses and haute couture tuxes as they partake of martini lunches and attend black-tie launch parties. Sexual romps are as commonplace as first-class business trips to New Orleans and the Caribbean. And didn\u2019t we all want to have an uppity auntie who lived on an estate named Lavender Hill?\n\nWhite critics panned Boomerang, saying that it was unrealistic in its portrayal of black life on celluloid. Some went so far as calling the film \u201cracist\u201d and a \u201cfantasy,\u201d saying that companies like Lady Eloise didn\u2019t exist. In other words, how dare Hudlin and Murphy create a film where everyone from the mailroom workers to the CEO was black and about that corporate life?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHudlin knew that black audiences of various socioeconomic statuses would relate to the film.\n\n\u201c[Boomerang is] a film that rings true to people,\u201d Hudlin says. \u201cAnyone who knows Johnson Publishing or Burrell advertising or Motown Records or BET or Radio One\u2014there\u2019s any number of black media businesses where black folks work and live our lives.\u201d\n\nHe was right.\n\nEvery black person who had been raised on a steady diet of Ebony magazine went to the theater opening weekend to consume all of the film\u2019s brown-sugary deliciousness. We made Boomerang a box-office smash. It grossed $70 million domestically and $131 million worldwide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMurphy made a string of films in the late 1980s and early \u201990s that, like Boomerang, presented fully imagined black universes. We wanted to visit Coming to America\u2019s (1988) pastel-painted land of Zamunda. Fans have re-created Zamunda in music videos, step shows and birthday bashes. Harlem Nights (1989) made us nostalgic for the 1930s, when black hustlers wore suits \u201ctailor-made to fit\u201d and ran the dopest night spots in all of New York City. These films share a theme: black people in control of our own communities. We triumph over the insidiousness of white supremacy, and black love\u2014romantic and familial\u2014wins.\n\nWe needed to see that then. We still do.\n\nThis is why we keep rewatching Boomerang\u2014reciting the lines verbatim\u2014every time it airs on BET, and why it remains one of the top-grossing black romantic comedies of all time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReflecting on Boomerang\u2019s legacy, Hudlin, whose political thriller Marshall hits theaters this October, says: \u201cI remember talking with Eddie Murphy about [Boomerang] years later. And he said, \u2018Reggie, I\u2019ve gotten compliments from Lena Horne and Ice Cube about it.\u2019 That\u2019s all of black America right there\u2014from Lena Horne to Ice Cube.\u201d\n\nTanisha C.

So I think I didn\u2019t really fully process what that meant\u2014that I was creating those pieces\u2014until I saw the movie the other day. The actual craftsmanship of those pieces was a very interesting yet challenging experience ... these pieces have a meaning. They have a specific meaning of who these women are, and what they do for their country. They\u2019re there to be resilient and strong, and to protect Wakanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m inspired and intrigued by how we choose to represent ourselves as resilient and beautiful and functional, regardless of what we\u2019ve experienced in life.\u201d\n\nDouriean\u2019s handmade, often hand-hammered aesthetic was a perfect match for this newest cinematic corner of the Marvel Universe, which introduces us to the technologically advanced, culturally rich fictional African nation of Wakanda. Douriean, who considers her work not only Afrofuturistic but \u201cAncient Futuristic\u201d or \u201cPrimal Chic,\u201d welcomed the challenge to translate her artistic aesthetic to the big screen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDouriean explained:\n\nI feel like I have a lot of responsibility, first off, to communicate a certain message through my work. I feel like it\u2019s a lot of responsibility, but I think it\u2019s a great position to be in. ... But I think as far as the Marvel Universe, it\u2019s a perfect match because I was able to bring something different to this culture of Wakanda, this fictional country that they had yet to really tap into.\n\nCostume designer Carter agreed, telling The Glow Up that she\u2019d specifically chosen Douriean because she felt strongly that the metal pieces used in Black Panther had to have a \u201chand-tooled African, hand-hammered\u201d aesthetic. That, coupled with director Ryan Coogler\u2019s desire for even the armor to look like beautiful African jewelry, made Douriean the ideal choice. The jewelry designer confessed to us that initially, she held back in deference to the Marvel aesthetic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[Ruth E. Carter] said, \u2018This isn\u2019t Douriean enough. You have to put more of yourself in it.\u2019 That was exciting. Like, oh, wait, you\u2019re giving me some space to do my thing,\u201d Douriean said.\n\nA Pasadena, Calif., native, Douriean has been creating jewelry since 2010. She is mostly self-taught, save for a three-month metalsmithing class in New Orleans. Having traveled throughout Tanzania and South Africa and now based in Los Angeles, she makes work that \u201cexplores cultural identity, femininity, spirituality and divine power.\u201d When asked where she gleans her inspiration, she told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nSometimes it\u2019s my story; if I experience something that\u2019s quite challenging, I\u2019ll take inspiration from that\u2014and, sometimes, motivation from those experiences\u2014and put that into a piece. Sometimes I literally just have dreams, and I wake up in the middle of night and sketch them out. And sometimes other people\u2019s stories, or just their essence ... women, we\u2019re very multifaceted creatures. So I\u2019m inspired and intrigued by how we choose to represent ourselves as resilient and beautiful and functional, regardless of what we\u2019ve experienced in life. ... The physique of a woman is very beautiful, and I want\u2014whenever I create something\u2014to be able to adorn someone to where they feel regal and beautiful and powerful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a female metalsmith, Douriean admitted that her eight-year journey has been a challenge, as there aren\u2019t many women in the field, let alone black women. But she credits the obstacles with her growth as an artist and innovator:\n\n\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve been underestimated at times; people are just surprised that I can create what I do, or doubt that I can create what I make. And because it\u2019s so different from what people think when they think of jewelry-making, it\u2019s been a challenge to find my niche and my clientele. Like this whole entire process, like this is the first time\u2014these past two years\u2014where I feel like I\u2019ve finally found my tribe and my clientele of people who can understand and accept my work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith that growth and increasing exposure have come major shifts for Douriean, especially as the officially licensed jewelry designer for both Black Panther and the upcoming Avengers film, which promises to be an even larger production. While creating for mass market raises her exposure and reach, it definitely presented challenges to her typically one-of-a-kind approach to design. According to Douriean:\n\nAs an artist, I like to create one-offs\u2014I like to create one thing, it has a story to it, it means something and it\u2019s for one particular person. To be able to have to expand that, and create a narrative for a group of people, it\u2019s a different way of approaching my work. So, for instance, the Black Panther line ... I created that, number one, for the comic book fan; the young men and women or the young boys and girls who grew up on the comics, who are super excited, who have been waiting for this moment for years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those of us coveting a piece of Black Panther to take home, the sterling silver Black Panther collection is currently available on Douriean\u2019s website. A collection inspired by Panther villain Killmonger is next, and lastly, a collection inspired by the Dora Milaje, which Douriean will handcraft herself.\n\nThe Glow Up caught a preview of both Lupita Nyong\u2019o and the designer herself at the Marvel Studios Black Panther Welcome to Wakanda New York Fashion Week presentation on Monday. Frankly, we can\u2019t wait to see if 24-karat-gold neck rings and epaulets are in our futures. The designer was coy:\n\n\u201cI wanted the Dora pieces to be very special, so I\u2019m handcrafting all of those. So it\u2019s coming. It\u2019s coming,\u201d she told us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut right now, Douriean is just savoring the moment and trying to process how it feels to become part of cinematic history:", "keywords": ["douriean", "panther", "black", "create", "adorned", "feel", "designer", "work", "jeweler", "jewelry", "heavy", "women", "armored", "metal", "think"], "polarity": 0.2566777954749653, "subjectivity": 0.5426845952789348},

We\u2019ll try to avoid any spoilers.\n\nBAMorg via YouTube\n\nThe Dora Milaje\u2014Wakandan for \u201cadored ones\u201d\u2014first appeared in 1998, created by Christopher Priest during his tenure as writer of Black Panther. Originally based on supermodels Naomi Campbell and Tyra Banks, the Dora were initially conceived not only as female warriors but also as potential wives for the king, whom they\u2019ve pledged to protect, along with the royal family. They were the best and strongest women from the 18 villages within Wakanda and trained at the royal palace.\n\nBut while Priest may in part cite supermodels as his inspiration, there is a historical prototype for the Dora Milaje in the Dahomey \u201cAmazons\u201d\u2014so nicknamed by European colonizers and now known by the French-speaking Beninese as the \u201cN\u2019Nonmiton\u201d (which translates to \u201cour mothers\u201d in Fon).\n\nCreated by King Agaja of the West African nation of Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) in the 18th century, the N\u2019Nonmiton were an all-female guard and fighting force, likely inspired by the female hunters known as gbeto. Like the Dora Milaje, the N\u2019Nonmiton were also considered wives of the king, pledging celibacy as well as loyalty and protection to him. And they existed in this role until the colonization of Dahomey in the late 19th century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can learn all about the incredible female warriors of Dahomey in a 2015 episode of the podcast Stuff You Missed in History Class, and in a very comprehensive comic on their history created by UNESCO for its Series on Women in African History (pdf).

Ever since I first saw Menace II Society in 1993 and Chauncey called Kane a \u201ccockblockin\u2019 motherfucker\u201d, I knew there was something special about him. Roughly an almost literal hundred thousand trillion roles later, I\u2019m still rockin\u2019 with him. When I fire up Netflix, sometimes I search for his name just so I can add each movie to the queue. Because I\u2019m going to watch it. Because Clifton Powell is good all the time, and all the time Clifton Powell is good. I don\u2019t know how or why he decided to become one of the greatest role players in Black American history, Blacking up the screen in new and innovative ways each time our, but it is an achievement for which he does not get enough credit.\n\nUntil today.\n\nShould I ever get a budget big enough to do this, I will personally fund, construct, and smile to the high heavens as Clifton Powell cuts the ribbon on the Clifton Powell Hall of Fame for Role Players in the Realm of Black Excellence at Cinematic Arts. Clifton Powell is deserving. He plays roles that I didn\u2019t even know I\u2019d want to see until he\u2019s in there. He is in movies that I do not know exist until I search his name. Then do you know what I do? I watch those movies. Who Made The Potato Salad? He was there. A Weekend with The Family? He was there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n99 North? Yep. Note to Self? There too. The Marriage Chronicles? The Preacher\u2019s Son? The Undershepherd? The Gospel? Yep. Word. Sho you right. You betta know that. He was there. If there\u2019s a Black movie that didn\u2019t quite hit the mainstream in the past 20+ years, there\u2019s a really, really good chance that Clifton Powell the Great is there, moving along the story, being stoic, Blackin', ushering in the talents of those around him in order to deliver the best movie possible with whatever material is present. Are all of his movies good? Absolutely not. But will I watch them anyway? Of course I will. Any actor who has put in so much work in so many different ways, all for the art of Black Excellence deserves a few hours of my time. Clifton Powell is an inspiration.\n\nHe is also not alone. There are a lot of actors and actresses who have contributed to Black Excellence in their roles as role players, ensuring that we can heal the world, make it a better place, for you and for me and the entire human race. They make Black movies of varying quality, but the truth is, whether a bad Black movie or a not bad one, they are I and I are them, sometimes conflicted, sometimes with lines, but always with Black in my heart. I\u2019m pretty sure that was the original new tag line for TVOne but they somehow ended up at Represent even though the 90s called and want their style back. I'm guessing they asked Ja Rule for advice.\n\nWho are these other purveyors of Black Excellence? I\u2019m glad you asked. Here are 8 inductess into the CPHOFfRPitRoBEaCA, which certain needs to be a thing. Also, I have no idea how to shorten that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Jason Weaver\n\nNobody has had as storied career as Jason Weaver. Hook Singer. Verse singer. Album dropper. TV Actor. Movie Actor. Dancer. Gold Teeth Savant. Animated Film Singer. If it needs doing, Jason Weaver can do it. He\u2019s been Michael Jackson AND Simba, easily two of the most iconic Black people to have ever lived. He\u2019s been in Chingy videos with Keisha Knight-Pulliam. Where has he ain\u2019t been? Know what I\u2019m sayin? He shows up in the most random of movies but the key words there are that he shows up. Jason Weaver, I salute you. From bigger films like ATL and Drumline to lesser films like He\u2019s Mine, Not Yours and Note to Self, Jason Weaver, you keep on keepin\u2019 on.\n\n2. Tatyana Ali\n\nAshley Banks brought you the original acclaim. Little did we know that it wasn\u2019t that you couldn\u2019t stop, it\u2019s that you wouldn\u2019t stop. From roles on the small screen to the big (ish) screen, and starring in meta-ass roles in both Brother and The Brothers, AND dropping an album as well, Tatyana Ali does it like she\u2019s doing it for TV because she still is and always will be. Take that. Take that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Rick Gonzalez\n\nUnless you pay attention, you might not know the name immediately. And that\u2019s a shame. He was playing basketball then quitting then gangbanging then playing again and taking errant three pointers in Coach Carter (who saved his life), he was a founding member of the Biker Boyz in the movie of the same name, he was in November Rule, a c-level Black movie where he sold shoes, and don\u2019t even get me started on Deuces where he used all of the skills from every movie he\u2019s been in to come up with his character\u2019s (Papers) ethos. Perhaps he\u2019s always the bridesmaid, but he\u2019s getting all the free drinks because he\u2019s always on your screen somewhere. Plus he was in Roll Bounce, easily one of the best movies to ever come out ever.\n\n4. Monica Calhoun\n\nShe might always be Ebony from The Player\u2019s Club to you, but she managed to find her a man in Lance in the Best Man though she bought the farm in the sequel. She\u2019s been around in c-level movies and major TV shows, and Love & Basketball ruining Monica\u2019s relationship though I guess she only went to Burger King. She\u2019s put in the time. She got her spot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Meagan Good\n\nThis woman needs no introduction, but I\u2019ll say this and keep it short and sweet, she played the shit out of the role in Waist Deep, which was no easy feat because this movie also stars Game as a dude named Big Meat, which, yeah. Then again all she had to do was be fine. Meagan Good has been around as long as most of us have playing the second banana but excelling at it and making EVERYBODY look good in the process.\n\n6. Wendy Raquel Robinson\n\nDo you know why she\u2019s a first ballot HOFer? Because of her role as Piggy aka Principal Regina Greer, love foil to Mr. Steve Hightower aka Steve Harvey. She single-handedly made it believable that it was possible for him to be a love interest. No work she did as Tasha Mack comes close to being as \u201cactish\u201d as that role. Wendy, you are a true American hero.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Christian Keyes\n\nChristian Keyes is a difficult one to nail down. He\u2019s out here creating his own movies, and trying to put positive imagery out there. But he\u2019s also never going to rise to the level that I\u2019m sure he believes he should be at. Then again, maybe he\u2019s exactly where he wants to be, happily in control of his career. Whatever the case may be, Christian Keyes is somebody who is another must watch for me on the Black movie circuit. If he\u2019s in the movie I\u2019m watching it. And he\u2019s usually the guy with a good heart who\u2019s still a nigga so he\u2019s definitely banging your daughter, but ultimately he only wants to do what\u2019s right and love everybody. And even though the majority of his movies have titles that sound like plays that Tyler Perry rejected, they all seem to bring me joy. Christian Keyes is doing what Shemar Moore wanted to do only folks gave Shemar more shots because he was prettier. Yet, I never look for Shemar Moore credits. Only Christian Keyes. Salute.\n\n8. Jazsmin Lewis\n\nWhile she is not Mike Jones, you might be asking yourself, who? This woman has 64 acting credits on IMDB, three which include Barbershop where she played Calvin\u2019s wife. But she brings so much more to the table. She shows up in movies that you don\u2019t see coming, often times with other inductees into the HOF. Her work in I Do\u2026I Did and Traci Townsend is legendary. It\u2019s not legendary.", "keywords": ["cinematic", "black", "players", "powell", "fame", "hes", "im", "movie", "excellence", "clifton", "role", "know", "good", "hall", "realm", "movies"], "polarity": 0.18534620672415944, "subjectivity": 0.4974448648464397},

So, imagine our surprise that one of the most melanin-rich presentations of the season almost escaped our notice: Maki Oh, by Nigerian designer Amaka Osakwe.\n\n\n\nBased in Lagos, Osakwe\u2019s been at the helm of her own label since 2010, and since that time has become one of the few Nigerian designers to have a global reach. Her designs have been worn by Beyonc\u00e9, Kerry Washington, and our forever First Lady, Michelle Obama.\n\nThis season, Osakwe sent her models down the runway in a range of muted hues and quirky but sophisticated silhouettes and pattern combinations that seemed to evoke a type of nomadic chic. These immensely wearable clothes are for a woman who is not only worldly but winsome, featuring wonderfully cut trousers, satiny slip-like pieces under suiting fabrics, and lam\u00e9 coats that I\u2019m literally swooning over. (Seriously. Gimme.)\n\nBut what was perhaps most beautiful about Maki Oh\u2019s presentation was that her models were all women of color, in all shades of color, seeming to represent the entirety of the African diaspora itself\u2014with their natural hair textures, no less!\n\nIt was a refreshing, almost matter-of-fact occurrence, and consistent with Osakwe\u2019s castings over her last few seasons. But during a week when black representation has long been a struggle, it felt like a definite boost for the home team.

Samantha Black, the Brooklyn, N.Y.-based designer of ready-to-wear line Sammy B., can tell you: \u201cMy phone was blowing up.\u201d\n\nWhy? While Black was asleep, dreaming up sexy leisurewear worthy of Queen Bey to wear on her private jet, Instagram caught fire. Zerina Akers, one of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s stylists\u2014as well as a friend of Black\u2019s\u2014had styled the star in a Sammy B. two-piece neoprene sweatsuit with a belted kimono-style Flatbush jacket ($150) and skinny Tony pop track pant ($110) in burgundy with contrasting pink athletic stripes.\n\nHearing the news, Black screamed out loud and then ran to check her website. The $260 two-piece sweatsuit had sold out within hours\u2014with 150 orders pending.\n\nBlack, who also happens to be model-gorgeous, is a two-time Project Runway contestant, competing in season 11 and All-Stars season 4. My dear friend Isaac Mizrahi, who judged her Sammy B. creations during the series, described her work to me as \u201clike Helmut Lang\u2014if his style was slightly more feminine.\u201d\n\nSince Black has her clothes handmade at a family-owned factory in Brooklyn, she had to shut down her website immediately and hustle to gather all the fabric she could find to fulfill the Beyhive\u2019s needs. What is it about that sweatsuit that\u2019s got everyone so hot?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think people loved it because for $260 you could get something Beyonc\u00e9 wore,\u201d she told me.\n\nNo sooner was she up and running again than fast-fashion knock-off artists Fashion Nova produced a copy of the Sammy B. two-piece sweatsuit, even making the unusual move of pricing the ensemble significantly higher than the designer had priced her own handmade version. Imitation may be the highest form of flattery, but for struggling young designers, it\u2019s tantamount to a poison kiss.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Twitter swooped in to to defend against the appropriators, migrating to Instagram to flood Fashion Nova\u2019s page, only to have their 30 comments vanish without reply. Meanwhile, sales slowed at Sammy B., which was no match for the more than 10 million Instagram followers scouring Fashion Nova for celebrity look-alike outfits that hit the market, sometimes within hours of appearing on the red carpet.\n\nSamantha Black via Instagram Samantha Black via Instagram 1 / 2\n\n\n\nHaving worked as a denim designer for top-selling contemporary brands like Aeropostale, Kenneth Cole, Jordache and Jessica Simpson, Black is no stranger to the wear and tear of the rag trade.

After an early childhood of correcting anyone who dared mispronounce it, I spent most of grammar school feeling burdened by a name seemingly so difficult, no one could be bothered to learn to say it right. By the time I reached junior high, I just wanted to fit in with a cute nickname. The clique of \u201cmean girls\u201d who conditionally befriended me at that age were happy to oblige, suggesting I call myself \u201cMisha\u201d because it was \u201ceasier.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey were right. Misha was easier than Maiysha. She was less ethnic, less complicated, less ... unique in the upscale Chicago suburb where I attended school. And it stuck; all through high school in the suburbs of Minneapolis and my elite liberal arts college years in New York, I was Misha.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until after college, while on a date with a brother who asked me point-blank why I hated the name my father had so lovingly chosen from the back of a Miles Davis album, that I began to ask myself. Very soon after, Maiysha took her rightful place in every introduction.\n\nOne of our undisputed #faves, Danai Gurira, had a similar experience in coming to accept\u2014and embrace\u2014her Zimbabwean name. The actress and writer\u2014who\u2019s rocking worlds this week as Dora Milaje general Okoye in Black Panther (and celebrated her 40th birthday on Valentine\u2019s Day)\u2014penned an intimate essay for Glamour magazine\u2019s February issue. In it, she talks about accepting her African name, which she confesses not even knowing she had until she was 5 years old:\n\nBorn in Grinnell, Iowa, to Zimbabwean academic parents, I was given a nickname, Dede, that stuck before I was cognizant enough to have a choice in the matter. Danai was on the register, certificates, trophies. Dede prevailed still. My own endorsement made it so. It sounded close enough to a Western name and made me feel like I fit in, to some extent at least. We were one of only two black families in town, and Mom and Dad already talked differently from everyone else. A strong African name? Too much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite having African-American parents, I knew that feeling all too well. And like me, Gurira had a \u201ccome to the culture\u201d moment that inspired a major shift in how she self-identified. She shares that transition with Glamour:\n\nI started reading Toni Morrison, Alex Haley, James Baldwin, speeches by Martin Luther King Jr., The Autobiography of Malcolm X. I started to connect the dots around why I was rejecting my people\u2019s cultural markers and the dominating effects of Eurocentric culture. I questioned why I didn\u2019t speak my parents\u2019 native language and began to test how much Shona I knew. I can\u2019t say exactly when it happened, but thank God that it did: I saw that rejecting my own culture, down to the name my parents had given me, was unacceptable. All of a sudden I needed to lay claim to what folks had fought and died for me to have\u2014the freedom to speak my own language, my own name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat freedom led Gurira to begin to refer to herself as \u201cZimerican,\u201d acknowledging her Zimbabwean and American identities as equal and inextricable from each other. It also led her to truly embrace both the beauty and troubled histories of her home countries, which, she writes, currently \u201csit at defining moments: America faces political division and a crisis of leadership, and Zimbabwe is finding its footing in a transition of power after decades under one man\u2019s rule.\u201d Owning that history was empowering for Gurira, who writes:\n\nI realized my heritage was to be celebrated, not denied. I didn\u2019t want to fit into what I perceived as a more Western, more acceptable mainstream. My middle name, Jekesai, means to \u201cilluminate,\u201d taken from a hymn about praying for a light at the end of a dark tunnel. I was born amid the war for independence in Zimbabwe, and my parents didn\u2019t know whether they\u2019d ever be able to go back. Jekesai was a declaration of their hopes that light would come. I wanted to bring light to those who should be seen more, heard more: people of marginalized cultures.\n\nIlluminating, indeed. In Shona, her parents\u2019 native tongue, Danai means \u201cto be in love\u201d or \u201cto love one another.\u201d The name is perfect for a Valentine\u2019s Day baby, but even more so for a woman who now consciously infuses her identity into everything she creates and chooses to participate in.\n\nI began to ask people to call me Danai. That choice has affected every choice I\u2019ve made since\u2014the stories I tell, the characters I play, the activism I embark upon. It has influenced everything from plays I write (including Eclipsed, about a girl thrown into a rebel war camp in Liberia) to portraying a general of an African king\u2019s army in Black Panther to co-founding the nonprofit Almasi Arts, a Zimbabwean American dramatic arts collaborative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust when we thought we couldn\u2019t love her more, Danai Gurira keeps stunning us with her beauty, her strength and, now, her transparency.

Hell, I, myself, lost $20 on this very discussion because of a bet that I placed where I just KNEW The Five Heartbeats lead singer was, in fact, Eddie Kane, Jr.\n\nI was, in fact, wrong. So let\u2019s set the table.\n\nKendrick Lamar - you may have heard of him - recently released his latest album, DAMN., to much fanfare and discussion on the Internets. The discussions have spread low and wide and if you\u2019re Black and listen to music, there\u2019s a better than 90 percent chance you have at some point in the past four days had a discussion about this album.\n\nOn this discussion-heavy album, there is a song called \u201cGOD.\u201d which I love. I listen to it all the time. It features many things held near and dear to Black people including the statement \u201cdon\u2019t judge me\u201d and a reference to El Debarge and his finger waves, long held to be one of the 9 wonders of the Black world. I cannot name the other 8 because that would be snitching, which is frowned upon, and that credo may or may not be a wonder of the Black world. You can see how complicated Blackness gets.\n\nIn this song - and this is NOT snitching - Kendrick drops the line, \u201cslick as El Debarge with finger waves, work it JT!\u201d which is a nod (I assume) to none other than J.T. Matthews, one of the members of The Five Heartbeats, a fictional group, long thought to be patterned after The Dells, for which a movie of the same name, The Five Heartbeats, exists. The other members of the group are Donald \u201cDuck\u201d Matthews (J.T.\u2019s brother and songwriter of the group), Terrence \u201cDresser\u201d Williams (whose real name you only find out through google because I\u2019m not sure his real name is ever said in the movie), Anthony \u201cChoir Boy\u201d Stone (whose name DOES get said in the movie), and the lead singer, the one and only, Eddie King, Jr., a man for whom the pronunciation of his name has caused actual arguments and fist fights. It\u2019s been said (though Snopes.com cannot prove it) that the first World Star fight video was between a grandmother and her 2nd cousin about whether Eddie\u2019s last name was King or Kane.\n\n\u201cWork it, JT\u201d derives from an early scene in the movie where J.T. and Duck run a scam on women that I\u2019m pretty sure does not still work today, where Duck would go over to a woman and get her number for J.T. by convincing said woman that J.T. was too shy (I\u2019m guessing that shit was cute back then) to come over himself. After a show where former lead singer (another fact verified by the interview that will be mentioned), Bobby, who lost his spot to Eddie by way of getting shot in the leg after running from a card game - we never hear from Bobby again - J.T. and Duck run the scam and then Duck asks J.T. to work the scam for him. It looks like it\u2019s going really well, hence the line, \u201cwork it J.T., work it!\u201d by Duck, only it turns out that J.T. selfishly got the chick\u2019s number for himself. But because God has a sense of humor and also doesn\u2019t like ugly, the woman whose number J.T. got was at the restaurant with a man who uttered the quotable ass quote, often heard at nightclubs and Black game nights everywhere, \u201cevery night I have to fight to prove my love\u201d as he goes off to whip J.T.\u2019s ass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLong explanation aside, that \u201cwork it J.T.\u201d line is one of my favorites. Always has been. Me and my boys use it all the time.\n\nI made mention of this on Facebook and one of my friends from college, and real talk I always give him credit for this, one of the reasons I ever started blogging in the first place, Calvin, jumps into the comments with this:\n\n\u201cMy favorite Five Heartbeats pet peeve/nit pick is that people refuse to call Eddie King Jr by his real name\u2026.it's not Eddie Kane or Eddie Cain or any other such variation! It's almost as bad as people saying \"who else wanna eff with Hollywood Cole\" (it's Hollywood Court)\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI, too, detest that everybody refers to that Hollywood Court as Hollywood Cole, a nod to Outkast\u2019s song \u201cSpottieottiedopalicious\u201d where Dre\u2019s Atlanta accent confused way too many people, but if you aren\u2019t from Atlanta then there is literally NO reason to know about Hollywood Court, a now demolished housing project on the West side of the city in Zone 1.\n\nAn-t-way, Calvin\u2019s comment reminded me of the time that I got verification from one person who could provide such verification of what Eddie\u2019s ACTUAL last name is: Robert Townsend, the who directed The Five Heartbeats, and co-wrote it with Keenan Ivory Wayans. If anybody knows the truth, it\u2019s him. Right? Right.\n\nIt just so happens that through the power of the Internets I once got the opportunity to speak to him and ask him directly. A woman I knew through VSB and I were talking about me wanting to ask Robert Townsend himself. Turns out, she was a publicist with The Caraway Group AND doing work for her firm on another movie he directed called In The Hive. She said she\u2019d set up an interview with him if I agreed to interview him about the movie and write a piece on VSB about it. (I still have all of the emails from September 2011 to prove it.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBruh. Sign me up.\n\nShe set up the interview and I had the opportunity to talk to him about In The Hive. We chopped it up for about 30 minutes and toward the conclusion of the interview I told him that I had to ask him a question that was going to settle bets everywhere: in The Five Heartbeats, what is Eddie\u2019s last name?\n\nHe said, definitively, that it was King. We laughed about that and I told him that I was about to lose a bet because I swore his last name was Kane (like so many people do). We got off the phone and I never did write up that feature (my bad).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut from there, every time it comes, I make sure to reference that convo to people and make sure that I\u2019m doing my part for the culture. So if you are indeed wondering and have been calling that man Eddie Kane, Jr., since the 90s, the truth is, his real name is Eddie King, Jr.\n\nHis name is his name. Sharing is caring and the more you know\u2026ding.\n\nSo in case you ever wondered, to quote Maxwell, don\u2019t ever wonder.\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.", "keywords": ["hey", "interview", "heartbeats", "yall", "heres", "movie", "real", "jr", "work", "kane", "hollywood", "know", "king", "jt", "eddie", "duck"], "polarity": 0.055871546149323936, "subjectivity": 0.4878698804624731},

President Donald Trump\u2019s handling of the death of Army Sgt. LaDavid Johnson; the White House\u2019s silence on the killing of Army 2nd Lt. Richard Collins III by a white supremacist; and the deafening silence about racism at the U.S. Air Force Academy are just a few examples in the last year.\n\nIt is often worse for black women in the armed forces who are victims of racial and sexual violence. Consider the case of LaVena Johnson, who, at 19 years old, was found dead of a gunshot wound in a tent in Balad, Iraq. Yet despite her body being found with a broken nose, a black eye, loose teeth and corrosive chemicals found on her genitals, the Army determined that her death was a suicide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere else in the world are black women\u2019s bodies, even when dedicated to the protection of a nation, so degraded or devalued? Apparently, the Israeli government isn\u2019t far behind America.\n\nFeb. 21 will mark the three-year anniversary of 19-year-old Cpl. Toveet Radcliffe\u2019s death, the first African-American woman to die in the Israeli Defense Forces. Radcliffe was found dead at Palmachim Airbase just south of Tel Aviv, Israel, from a gunshot wound to the head. In early February, the IDF ruled that Radcliffe\u2019s case will not be reopened. Investigators ruled that the gunshot that went through her forehead and came out the back was a result of an accidental or intentional suicide. However, Radcliffe\u2019s family and members of the African Hebrew Israelite community aren\u2019t so sure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToveet Radcliffe was born in Israel to African-American parents who moved to there to practice as Hebrew Israelites, an Afrocentric form of Old Testament Judaism. She grew up happy and popular in the southern Israeli city of Dimona, where about 10 percent of the population are Hebrew Israelites, and she was known for her beauty and gregarious personality.\n\n\n\nDespite being born in Israel, Radcliffe was not a practicing Hebrew Israelite; nor was she an Israeli citizen. In fact, Hebrew Israelites are not automatically granted Israeli citizenship; the Israeli government had tried to kick them out of the country for years (part of a larger problem of the Israeli government\u2019s discrimination against African and African-American Jews) until eventually granting them a tenuous residency status. Hebrew Israelites often live as second-class citizens, denied public education and state health care because their practice of Judaism isn\u2019t \u201corthodox.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNevertheless, children can earn citizenship for themselves, and their families can become eligible to apply for full citizenship after serving a tour in the armed forces. Radcliffe joined the military in October 2013 and died barely a year into her service\u2014not from terrorists or criminals but from a bullet wound to the head while sitting in a guard booth.\n\nShe was found just after midnight, bleeding from a head wound, by the soldier who was to replace her on duty; she was declared dead by a military doctor less than half an hour later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter almost three years of legal wrangling, Judge Major Meir Vigiser ruled it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that no other person was with Radcliffe when she was shot. Vigiser rejected several experts presented by the Radcliffe family suggesting foul play, instead placing the young woman\u2019s death in her own hands.\n\nAbout 30 members of the Hebrew Israelite community, all wearing white, sat in the courtroom for over an hour, listening to Vigiser\u2019s ruling. Radcliffe\u2019s mother, Khydijah Gray, refused to attend the final hearing because she doubted that justice would come. While the verdict clearly disappointed the Radcliffe family and its supporters, it did not shock them.\n\n\u201cI am absolutely not surprised. I would have been surprised if they had done the right thing,\u201d Shayarah Baht Yisrael said to The Root.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think the whole investigation was flawed from the beginning. And that alone is jail time, as far as I\u2019m concerned. The fact that they tried to sweep it under the rug so quickly, I\u2019m very, very frustrated by that,\u201d Ketreyah Fouch said.\n\nAs supporters from the community trailed out of the Bar Lev Base, one young woman told The Root: \u201cToveet was too good to serve in the Israeli army, in general. Like all of us, we\u2019re just too good to serve in this army.\u201d\n\nHours after attending the court session, African Hebrew activist Ashriel Ben-Israel uploaded a video to Facebook calling the verdict \u201ca big embarrassment\u201d: \u201cWe do not accept it, this decision! We no longer believe any army representative regarding this case,\u201d Ben-Israel bellowed in Hebrew, overcome with emotion. \u201cWe will not allow this decision to pass in silence,\u201d he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiscrepancies in the IDF\u2019s account of her death disturbed Radcliffe\u2019s family and friends from the start. On Jan. 18, 2016, nearly a year after the fatal incident, the IDF published the results of its internal investigation into Radliffe\u2019s death\u2014essentially suicide. At the most basic level, it is hard to believe that 5-foot-2-inch Toveet Radcliffe managed to shoot herself through the forehead with an M4 (demonstrated below with a paper replica by her sister).\n\nGiven that the Israeli government offered to pay the Radcliffe family a lifelong stipend (for a solider who committed suicide), the questionable investigation (significant physical evidence was never examined), and the dismissal of key witnesses and testimony, Radcliffe\u2019s family sought the truth. The Hebrew Israelite community raised funds for a legal appeal that bore fruit a year later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn March 17, 2017, the president of the IDF Court of Appeals, Maj. Gen. Doron Feiles, ordered a reinvestigation of Radcliffe\u2019s death. In his decision, Feiles conceded that the IDF had not definitively demonstrated that Radcliffe had committed suicide and had not even bothered to seriously consider any other possible explanation for her death.\n\n\u201cIt could be that the IDF felt that Toveet\u2019s life wasn\u2019t of value on the scale of social importance. Maybe in its opinion, she was just a girl from a black community in Dimona, just some unimportant girl,\u201d the community leadership said the day after the Vigiser verdict in a press release. \u201cTaking into account the apathy, arrogance and total lack of transparency on the part of the IDF, it must be seen as suspect No. 1.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRadcliffe\u2019s case had become a national story in Israel over the last few year; it was featured in several CSI/The First 48-style TV investigative shows. Yet despite the historic nature of a black girl with African-American parents dying mysteriously in the IDF, it received little or no coverage in the United States. No major news stories, no #SayHerName hashtags. A Change.org petition to President Barack Obama in 2016 on her behalf couldn\u2019t muster 1,000 signatures.\n\nWith the case officially over, members of the Hebrew Israelite community vow that they will continue the fight even if it\u2019s unclear how that will occur. The Israeli government can delay, deny or possibly void the citizenship of community members who push back too hard. Furthermore, with little or no international attention or pressure, \u00e0 la #BringBackOurGirls, there\u2019s no reason to believe that the conservative Benjamin Netanyahu government would even care.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean her case doesn\u2019t matter; it only means that if black lives truly matter across the globe, we must add Toveet Radcliffe\u2019s name to the sadly growing list of black people betrayed, abandoned and possibly killed by their governments.", "keywords": ["toveet", "israeli", "isnt", "black", "death", "military", "ruled", "community", "sayhername", "radcliffe", "idf", "hebrew", "radcliffes", "suicide", "case", "woman", "family"], "polarity": -0.026468473655973653, "subjectivity": 0.42963757179034956},

But since we here at The Glow Up sit at the intersection of Fashion Week and Black History Month (and Wakanda, obvi), we couldn\u2019t help noticing another trend rising the past few seasons: a surge in blackness-branded clothing we haven\u2019t seen since the early \u201990s (more on that trend to come).\n\n\n\nWhat was really striking to us was the re-emergence of our two primary civil rights icons, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr., as the focus of two clothing lines this season: the Malcolm X Legacy collection, which debuted at Harlem Fashion Week 2018, and recent releases from New York-based skateboarding brand Supreme, whose latest lookbook features clothing emblazoned with MLK\u2019s visage and most famous phrases: \u201cI have a dream\u201d and \u201cWe shall overcome.\u201d\n\nSuffice it to say, reviews on the much-better-known Supreme collection were mixed, especially among The Root crew.

Although I must admit that this morning\u2019s lookbook was sad, and the MLK hoodie was one of the better pieces in a sad way. ...

MLK fits that mold, even if that all-over print sweatshirt is fugazi.\u201d \u201cThe Sade was fresh. This was a mess. It looked like something I\u2019d be forced to buy if I caught a chill at Jazz Fest ... and I\u2019d stay cold.\u201d \u201cI think MLK on the arms was overkill. Never put MLK on the arms.\u201d \u201cThat sweatshirt was all the velvet paintings and airbrushed backdrops of MLK that ever were.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK. So that release was considered less than \u201csupreme\u201d around these parts. But not to be outdone, the jewel in the crown that was 2018 Harlem Fashion Week was the debut of the Malcolm X Legacy collection, co-helmed by the six daughters of Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz\u2014Qubilah, Attallah, Ilyasah, Malikah, Gamilah and Malaak Shabazz. Instead of simply licensing their father\u2019s words and image to an existing brand, the Shabazz sisters teamed up with tech company Hingeto and emerging designer Yvonne Jewnell to collaborate on a clothing line that pays homage to their father\u2019s legacy.\n\nThe contemporary urbanwear line features clothing inspired by the 12 principles of Malcolm X, which stressed the importance of human rights, education, economic independence, cultural pride and justice. The Shabazz sisters created the collection in hopes of inspiring a younger generation of activists to follow in their father\u2019s steps.\n\nThe Glow Up\u2019s editorial team (supermodel Veronica Webb and myself) had the pleasure of being front row at the debut of the Malcolm X Legacy collection at the inaugural event of Harlem Fashion Week on Feb. 4, a sold-out runway presentation at the gorgeous Museum of the City of New York. We can vouch for the fact that these are definitely clothes for a new generation of Malcolm X followers\u2014fresh, funky, fashion-forward and sexier than expected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while we both enjoyed the presentation, we\u2019ll let you judge for yourselves this round. Because when it comes to wearing our love for our slain civil rights leaders on our sleeves, maybe there\u2019s only one question: Who wore it best?", "keywords": ["rights", "collection", "civil", "mlk", "supreme", "icon", "best", "befits", "shabazz", "malcolm", "clothing", "legacy", "week", "fashion", "x"], "polarity": 0.12235064935064938, "subjectivity": 0.5086450216450217},

Carter\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 reads like a list of iconic favorites from contemporary black cinema. In the 30 years since her first film, Spike Lee\u2019s 1988 hit, School Daze, the Oscar- and Emmy-nominated costume designer has amassed more than 60 film and television credits, including I\u2019m Gonna Git You Sucka (1988); Do the Right Thing (1989); Mo\u2019 Better Blues (1990); House Party 2 (1991); Jungle Fever (1991); The Five Heartbeats (1991); Malcolm X (1992); What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It (1993); Crooklyn (1994); Clockers (1995); B*A*P*S (1997); Rosewood (1997); Amistad (1997); Love & Basketball (2000); Shaft (2000); Bamboozled (2000); Black Dynamite (2009); Sparkle (2012); The Butler (2013); Selma (2014) and Marshall (2017), not to mention Being Mary Jane and the recent reboot of Roots (2016).\n\nNow Carter is stunning us once again with her work in the most anticipated film of the year, Black Panther, her 40th film and first superhero narrative (unless you count Malcolm X). The Glow Up was blessed with the opportunity to speak with her during the flurry of publicity for this groundbreaking film while she took a rare timeout in Cape Town, South Africa. It proved a fitting setting to discuss how she helped create the fictional African country of Wakanda, and how it feels to quietly be one of the architects of black cultural collective consciousness. Ever humble, the now legendary designer told us:\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. ... You look at enough research, you know the people. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. And so, collectively, when [I] look at my work, I just feel proud that I had some consistency with my approach to all of them. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from. I was challenged each time to really get it right. ... That\u2019s kind of been my journey. And so when I look back at everything, I feel a sense of accomplishment and pride that Black Panther has kind of brought me full circle. I feel like I traveled from slavery with Roots and Amistad. And I went through the Depression with Rosewood in the \u201920s. I did Selma in the \u201950s. With Malcolm X, it was the \u201920s all the way through the \u201960s, and then I got a little \u201970s here and there with some funny ones like Black Dynamite. And then Black Panther came along, and now I\u2019m circling right back to Africa. So I actually feel like I closed the circle a little bit ... and I think they all helped to connect African history and African-American history. I\u2019m hoping for that.\n\nCarter, who has made history of her own as the first African American to be nominated for an Academy Award in costume design\u2014first for Malcolm X and again for Amistad\u2014ventured into new territory for her first Marvel film. In a stroke of luck, she learned she\u2019d gotten the job while working on Marshall, the Thurgood Marshall biopic starring future T\u2019Challa, Chadwick Boseman, directed by Black Panther comic writer Reginald Hudlin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like, you know how lucky is this? I get to study [Chadwick\u2019s] body; I get to ask Reggie questions about the Black Panther concept,\u201d Carter said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even that recon couldn\u2019t fully prepare Carter for the Marvel experience, working with a team of five illustrators and a huge crew to bring the citizens of Wakanda to life. It was also the first time she had to design with movie merchandise in mind\u2014including action figures\u2014which meant that unlike Carter\u2019s previous work, many of the major costumes, like T\u2019Challa\u2019s iconic suit, were already well-defined. Instead, her role was to bring authenticity to characters that the fans of Black Panther have previously known only as illustrations, as she told The Glow Up: \u201cOnce I got the framework, we did a lot of experimentation. ... It\u2019s kind of like they gave me a coloring book and a big box of crayons.\u201d\n\nThat experimentation involved extensive research by Carter\u2019s team of four, exploring the ancient peoples of Africa\u2014including the Zulu, Maasai, Himba, Xhosa and the Turkana, which inspired the beautiful beading and neckpieces of the Dora Milaje. (Notably, Carter tries to steer clear of the word \u201ctribe\u201d because of its colonialist overtones, preferring to simply call each group of people by its name.)\n\nIn doing so, her team divided Wakanda into districts, according to a \u201cbible\u201d of sorts composed by director Ryan Coogler and production designer Hannah Beachler, that outlined both the story and layout of the fictional country. Said Carter:\n\nIt was an incredible piece of work; it was an incredible notebook that really forged us all so far ahead, because we were all working from the same nucleus ... there\u2019s different [communities] of Wakanda, and that bible that they did really outlined what parts of Wakanda were what. [For example] if you take any city, like New York, and you divide it by, you know, midtown, Brooklyn, the Village, NYU area, uptown, Columbia, Harlem, you kind of have a good sense of how Wakanda is broken up, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to Carter\u2019s core team, she also employed locals in South Africa and Ghana to search out antiques that would inspire the handmade feel she strongly felt Black Panther\u2019s costumes needed to have. Following Coogler\u2019s request that even the armor of the Dora Milaje feel like jewelry, Carter also brought on board friend and jeweler Douriean, who specializes in Afrofuturistic, hand-tooled, hand-hammered pieces, many of which have been worn by cast members during the film\u2019s premieres and press. Douriean is also the creator of Black Panther\u2019s officially licensed line of jewelry.\n\nAnd while Carter doesn\u2019t describe the experience as a seamless one, she credits Marvel for helping her realize the vision; even when some of the challenges of bringing Wakanda to life proved daunting:\n\nI had the greatest support from Marvel. The head executives, they never wavered. I never, ever felt\u2014and you know, every costume designer has at some point on a show felt like, \u201cThey\u2019re going to fire me, I know it. I\u2019m going to be fired tonight.\u201d We all go through that. And even though I may have had those thoughts, they were few and far between because I felt like I was supported 100 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney 1 / 15\n\nCarter is no stranger to making even the improbable possible; in her days as a student at Hampton University, she created a costume-design curriculum for herself after finding that there was nothing available to foster her budding talent. After graduation and a few opera-company internships, her HBCU experience and ingenuity came in handy when a chance meeting with director Spike Lee led to her first film, the now classic School Daze. It was the first of 14 films they\u2019d make together.\n\nBut even if she\u2019d do it all again, would she advise others to follow in her footsteps? She told The Glow Up: \u201cWell, don\u2019t do what I did, because I don\u2019t think it works today. I think that there\u2019s more avenues than I had. So I hope that my career has made some of those avenues available for other people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from.\n\nIf nominated for next year\u2019s Academy Award, Carter could become both the first woman ever to win for a superhero film and the first black woman to win for best costume design. But when asked if she has any reservations or resentments about primarily being hired to costume black films\u2014which make up most, but far from all, of her work\u2014she had this to say:", "keywords": ["consciousness", "black", "panther", "theyre", "marveldisney", "wannabes", "felt", "feel", "ruth", "carter", "cultural", "film", "know", "costumes", "wakanda"], "polarity": 0.2138487889520948, "subjectivity": 0.47147418697005467},

How could they not? The label cuts some of the best outerwear in the business.\n\nWhen you throw shearling jackets, fox-fur chubbies, trenches tiled with fur patchwork, PVC-detailed bombers and reversible raincoats over Black Panther-inspired Speedo wetsuits, finished off with fresh pairs of Tims, you know what happens? #BlackGirlMagic, that\u2019s what. Add a DJ, film crews, social media influencers like June Ambrose, Blake Scott, Saint Jhn and every major fashion magazine, and you\u2019re on the road to what could be a successful season.\n\nRomeo Hunte via YouTube\n\nBut showmanship is not to be confused with craftsmanship. Hunte\u2019s collection does not depend on hype; rather, it depends on finely worked jackets with well-thought-out detailing like detachable sleeves, reversible linings and detachable collars in combinations that are at once surprising and surprisingly wearable.\n\nFor his 2018 Fall/Winter collection, the designer said that his inspiration was Aspen, Colo., a city that is cloaked in posh ski resorts, five-star restaurants, world-class think tanks and luxury shopping that\u2019s as intense as any black diamond ski run. It\u2019s also a city where your coat conveys status as much as, if not more than, your clothes; those wet suits Hunte used as underpinnings may have been a nod also to the one-piece ski suits so ubiquitous in the Mile-High City.\n\nHunter has a unique vocabulary when it comes to coats that draws equally from cinched, belted and chained Italian police uniforms; Marcy Projects street style; and the glamour of old Hollywood movies. Hunte\u2019s women make grand entrances and dramatic exits; one particular standout this season was a trench coat with fox-fur patchwork.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what Hunte does best is updating and reworking his own signature details and patterns. He is known for dressing celebs like Beyonc\u00e9, Halle Berry and Zendaya in buffalo-check ponchos; this season, clear PVC was added as an overlay on the checked pattern to give this soft staple fabric both edge and a modern dimension. (You\u2019ll likely be seeing a lot of PVC this season; it was also utilized by Virgil Abloh in his capsule collection for Jimmy Choo that debuted at New York Fashion Week on Tuesday.)\n\nWhat we saw this season was a modern woman\u2019s uniform for traveling exploring.

In the past four years, the third-generation hairstylist has been making her mark on Marvel films, leading the hair departments of the last two Captain America films, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and, now, Black Panther.\n\nOf course, the Black Panther is a unique superhero, and Black Panther is already proving to be an exceptionally unique film, as Friend tells The Glow Up:\n\nI think Black Panther is\u2014I call it a stand-alone Marvel movie, even though Marvel still has a formula. But I feel like it\u2019s a stand-alone movie, especially for me, because I\u2019m a black woman, and [to do] the first black superhero, that was really an honor, in the sense [that] we\u2019re presenting all of this to the world. We had an important job to do, and I looked at it in a whole different way, because it represents my people. So I felt like, the weight of the world on me at some points, but in the greatest way\u2014that I had the opportunity to present us in the best possible light and put something on camera that\u2019s never been [seen]. So it\u2019s a great responsibility and it\u2019s a great challenge, but it\u2019s my greatest joy in doing it, also.\n\nRepresenting her people was paramount in Friend\u2019s mind as she approached the task of helping to bring Black Panther to life. To begin, she divided the film into three elements: traditional Africa, contemporary Africa and the futuristic Africa represented by the technologically advanced civilization that is Wakanda. In her research, she drew inspiration from everything from traditional African tribes like the Maasai and Zulu to the groundbreaking fashion statements we\u2019ve seen at Afropunk celebrations around the globe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really taking and looking at traditional styles, traditional tribal looks, and seeing what we can make into a modern style,\u201d Friend says. \u201cI like to take, like, a period hairstyle and put it in a modern movie and just put a twist on it. For me, it\u2019s still about classic hairdressing and beautiful lines and silhouettes. That\u2019s how I design hair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriend has certainly had her share of experience with period styles, having also headed the hair departments of Miles Ahead, The Help, Django Unchained, Rock of Ages and Dreamgirls. But whether it\u2019s long and flowing or elaborately braided and twisted, one thing you won\u2019t see in Black Panther is any straightened hair. For Friend, natural hair textures were a major part of her contribution to the visual narrative.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a beautiful time where people are wearing their natural hair,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, there [are] women everywhere who are like, \u2018Throw the pressing comb away, throw the relaxer away. I\u2019m going to wear my natural hair.\u2019 So that whole movement of the empowerment of the hair is there,\u201d Friend explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a diverse universe of naturally styled characters involved a team highly skilled in styling, caring for and mimicking natural hairstyles, as in the case of Angela Bassett\u2019s glorious custom-made wig of 24-inch silvery locs, inspired in equal parts by writer Toni Morrison and director Ryan Coogler\u2019s mother, Joselyn.\n\nBut while Friend isn\u2019t playing favorites on the styles she created, she\u2019s already seeing the influence this film is having on our beauty and fashion choices. She\u2019s received countless raves on the twisted crop Lupita Nyong\u2019o rocks as Dora Milaje operative Nakia and graciously provided The Glow Up with the how-to (hint: The key is keeping it close to the scalp):\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018Wakanda knot\u2019\u2014because it is different than a Bantu knot,\u201d she tells us. \u201c[Because] basically, the hair is rolled down, kind of like a cinnamon roll. And then, once the hair is dried, then, we lifted it from there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEducating other hairstylists is a huge part of Friend\u2019s career, as her greatest hope is to see more hairstylists performing at the top of their game. That\u2019s why she created Hair Scholars, a consortium of award-winning artists led by Friend in educating and preparing aspiring stylists to be the best at their craft and ready to work in the industry.\n\nFriend knows firsthand the value of having a talented team by her side. She credits her Black Panther team for being a large part of the inspiration and craftsmanship that we\u2019ll see on-screen next week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt just felt like our brains\u2014the brainpower was just so high, and the energy was so high, just because we got to create,\u201d she says. \u201cOr somebody\u2019s like, \u2018Well, let\u2019s try this.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Let\u2019s try it!\u2019\n\n\u201cSo it was really great to have that think tank, where we could just be in there and be creating, and just really coming up with things on the fly ... just really having the momentum just to create original pieces that are going to stand the test of time on film,\u201d she continues.\n\nAnd of course, we couldn\u2019t end our conversation without asking Friend how it felt to be on the purple carpet for Black Panther\u2019s epic premiere in Los Angeles last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe premiere was like, you know, it was like 2018 Coming to America\u2014like, it was for real. People took it all the way,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think what it is too, is as black people, we have like\u2014especially now\u2014there\u2019s a sense of pride. People are wearing their hair natural. People are [saying] \u2018black excellence.\u2019 People are rising to the occasion, and I think this movie comes at the time where black people, we want to step forward; we want to be recognized.\n\n\u201cThis movie hits all the right notes for having a black superhero,\u201d she explains. \u201cI mean, at the end of the day, we all want to be superheroes, in whatever we do. If we\u2019re a mom, if we\u2019re a secretary, if we\u2019re a hairdresser\u2014whatever we do, we all want to be a superhero.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re an Los Angeles-based hair artist, you can join Camille Friend for a Hair Scholars master class at the \u201cHair and Makeup by ... \u201d Symposium on March 11 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.", "keywords": ["meet", "hero", "hair", "black", "panther", "camille", "friend", "movie", "traditional", "designer", "really", "panthers", "teamsupernatural", "natural", "think", "having"], "polarity": 0.17398076259489295, "subjectivity": 0.5284920634920632},

The celebrity DJ-model-producer (and much more) shifted the paradigm in our favor in 2006 when she founded Black Girls Rock!, the award show and nonprofit organization that has since earned worldwide acclaim.\n\nFittingly, Bond literally holds the trademark to \u201cBlack Girl Magic\u201d\u2014a phrase she recently discovered may have originated in friend and author Joan Morgan\u2019s \u201990s hip-hop feminist tome When Chickenheads Come Home to Roost. Bond loves that the expression has become a recent addition to our common lexicon about black womanhood, as she has made it her mission to help as many girls find their magic as possible.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to know everything, but you might know somebody that knows something else, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been able to do [with] Black Girls Rock!\u2014I\u2019ve been able to tap into our village to help me bring this to life and do this work.\n\nNow eBay is recognizing and supporting Bond\u2019s efforts by partnering with Black Girls Rock! for an epic inaugural auction to raise funds for the organization in honor of Black History Month. Launched on Feb. 5, the auction features such gems as a pair of worn and signed ballet shoes from Misty Copeland, coveted red-carpet access to the next Black Girls Rock! award show and signed copies of Bond\u2019s upcoming Black Girls Rock! book, which debuts on Feb. 27 and is already the No. 1 book in preorders on Amazon.com\u2014as well as the first prize to sell out on the eBay auction. As Bond tells The Glow Up:\n\nYou know, I\u2019m just really grateful\u2014it\u2019s exciting to see that people are receiving it so well. But also, it speaks to the importance of the message continuing\u2014the need for the message ... In 2006, when I started Black Girls Rock!, there wasn\u2019t this celebration, acknowledgment [or] inclusion of black women\u2019s narratives, stories, beauty, diversity, nuances\u2014it just wasn\u2019t there in media\u2014in fact, it was completely the opposite, if anything. And so to see where the world has come to now, in this time, and to see all this \u201cBlack Girl Magic\u201d surfacing\u2014or people discovering [it]\u2014it\u2019s just an incredible thing, to know that Black Girls Rock! was very much at the forefront of this movement. It means a lot, but I don\u2019t get fooled by trends ... I feel that the work needs to continue there, and I know that we have to continue to push our message, our narrative, and keep our presence in the forefront. We matter and our voices matter, and our accomplishments matter, our contributions matter, our achievements matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupporting the accomplishments and achievements of future generations is at the heart of Black Girls Rock!, and 100 percent of proceeds from the auction will go back into the organization\u2019s programs, like the Black Girls Lead conference and camps, which have yielded proven results through mentorship, as Bond tells us:\n\nWe are really giving girls tools that they need to empower themselves to take their best to their \u201cbestest\u201d; to go to their next level. And so it\u2019s been really successful. We have a lot of incredible girls that have gone through our programs that stay connected with us, that are now in college. Some of them are graduating [and] going into the business world now. So you know, just to see this work over this time, and to see girls that we\u2019ve literally been surrogate mothers to, in a sense, grow into these incredible young women, it\u2019s been amazing to see.\n\nTo understand the potential impact of a juggernaut like eBay joining forces with Black Girls Rock!, to date, eBay for Charity has raised nearly $810 million for participating charities, raising $84 million in 2017 alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe auction is live until Feb. 15, and the following items and experiences are still up for grabs:\n\nBallet shoes worn and signed by Misty Copeland.\n\n\n\nVIP Experience at the 2018 Black Girls Rock!

One says \u201cBlack Girls Rock!\u201d and the other says \u201cWESLAY.\u201d Each pin is available for $15, or you can purchase the pair for $25. You can also add an additional donation to your purchase during checkout. Remember\u2014100 percent of proceeds benefit Black Girls Rock!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBond hopes that this auction will be the first of many as she continues to grow Black Girls Rock! and ensure that #BlackGirlMagic remains more than a catchphrase, hashtag or trend. She\u2019s constantly strategizing new ways to do the work of elevating us\u2014and hopes that more will do the same:\n\nIt\u2019s easier to do the work than we think it is. And I think that sometimes people get so caught up in the idea [that] it takes so much to start a charity or start a mentoring program. And it really just takes whatever knowledge and skill that you have, using that to empower the next person. You don\u2019t have to know everything, but you might know somebody that knows something else, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been able to do in this time of building Black Girls Rock!\u2014both the award show and the nonprofit. I\u2019ve been able to kind of tap into the community and tap into our village to help me bring this to life and help me do this work.

There will be the obligatory biopics with actors embodying disability or overcoming adversity. There will the political films that uncover a scandal or tell stories centered in human misery. Then there will be the artistic achievements, you know,films about basically nothing but either took a long time to make or have unconventional direction.\n\nAs we move into this season, I thought it wise to look back at films that many black folks love and explain why they either should not be considered a black film or why they ain\u2019t worth a damn.\n\nLook, just because a film is watchable doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s good and there are a number of beloved black movies that are valorized just because they star black actors. I call these the \u2018Halle Berry (HB) Awards\u2019 in honor of the preeminent overrated black actress who won an Oscar for being a mediocre white man\u2019s jump off.\n\nHB #1: The Wiz\n\nThis movie is boring and it\u2019s directed by a white dude (more on that later). Yes, there are amazing musical numbers. Yes, Michael Jackson danced and sang his ass off. Still, this hot garbage is hardly watchable. The narrative will put you to sleep faster than a Benadryl downed with a glass of red wine, and the acting is aggressively bad. Like, DMX in Belly kind of bad. Diana Ross killed the singing, though. Too bad they asked her to act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI would wager that most people fast forward through the story and only watch the musical numbers and if you don\u2019t you\u2019re losing at life.\n\nHB#2: The Color Purple\n\nThis movie has great acting, great direction, and brilliant source material. My only beef is that Steven Spielberg is the director. I guess they could not find someone black to put behind the camera.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t care how many times you quote the film or how much your big mama watched it, if someone black ain\u2019t in the directing chair, I\u2019m not considering it a great black film.\n\nHB #3: Coming to America\n\nSee HB 2. No black director. I refuse to consider it a great black film.\n\nHB #4: Hidden Colors\n\nThis is what you watch at the beginning of Hotep basic training. It purports to give insight about the lost history of black people in America, and even if I were able to turn off my philosophical mind, I\u2019d still find some of the information difficult to believe. Further, the director is a noted misogynist and, just being honest, the film\u2019s production values are laughable. This movie is so laced with Hotepism that I needed a bottle of lotion for my ashy ankles after watching it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHB#5: She\u2019s Gotta Have It\n\nSpike Lee\u2019s first film is aiight. He tries to elevate the material by shooting it in black and white, but the gender politics are antiquated and the acting is mediocre at best. It\u2019s Spike\u2019s first film, and I can tell.\n\nHB#6: Every single Tyler Perry film (except Daddy\u2019s Little Girls) and ESPECIALLY Temptation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m not even going to dignify these films with a thoughtful analysis.\n\nHB #7: Lean On Me\n\nThis film is beloved by black grandfathers everywhere because it is a two-hour meditation on patriarchy and respectability politics. Joe Clark begins the film by expelling 300 students, and then begins to treat educators and students alike in a condescending and infantile manner. Oh yeah, a white dude directed this film as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Fair Eastside\u2019 was dope, tho.\n\nHB#8: All the sequels to Friday\n\nYou know those movies aren\u2019t funny. You ain\u2019t gotta lie to kick it.\n\nHB #9: New Jack City\n\nThis film has not aged well. The haircuts are laughably bad, the dialogue is VERY bad (Ice-T actually says, \u201cI want to shoot you so bad my dick is hard\u201d), and the acting is worse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNino Brown is a cartoonish villain (Did he really put crack in the Thanksgiving turkey?) and the film does not deal with the way housing discrimination and poverty played a role in the explosion of violence in the 1990s. This film is essentially a commercial for the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. I\u2019m pretty sure Hilary got the idea of Super Predators watching this movie.\n\nHB#10: Baby Boy\n\nWith the exception of Four Brothers, John Singleton has been making nonsense since 1997, and that\u2019s too bad\u2014he started with such promise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoyz N The Hood is a black coming of age masterpiece; Poetic Justice is a ghettoized take on a road movie, and both Higher Learning and Rosewood are essential, tragic films. It all started going downhill when he made Baby Boy\u2014and I can see why.\n\nThis is an indulgent film. It tries to be a coming of age tale for a grown ass man, a comedy, a tense, urban drama, and a love story all at once\u2014while failing on all fronts. The direction is sloppy; the editing haphazard, and the acting is so bad that Gary Coleman would be offended. Snoop Dogg is supposed to be a threatening presence, but his arms look so emaciated in the scene with an undershirt that it made me wonder if he would have the strength necessary to pull a trigger if the narrative called for it.\n\nSingleton thinks he is insightful in the critiques of black men as careless fathers, but he merely showcases respectability politics and patriarchy in how the narrative is resolved. The film lacks the insight of Boyz in explicating how institutional racism plays a role in the failure of some black men to play an active role in the lives of their children, and, ultimately, the film calls for men to grow up and be the heads of their households without showing the barriers that could preclude such a happy ending from taking place. Essentially, according to this movie, black men need to pull up their pants, get a job, and take care of their families. But what happens if race keeps you from making a living, saving wage?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sure folks will be coming for my black card or calling my place of employment demanding that I no longer teach classes on black films.

How about a battery-powered radiant-heat jacket that fits the whole family, to keep them warm when putting your arms around them is not quite enough?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Volt Radiant Heated Jacket is powered by a 5-volt USB power bank battery that is easily found at most drugstores and does double duty in its ability to charge your cellphone! I like the jacket for game day, long walks or after the gym, because it has concentrated areas of radiant heat between the shoulder blades, lower back and abdominals. The cut is sleek and athletic, and at $149, it\u2019s priceless on a freezing-cold day.\n\nLooking for some super soul style? When it comes to dressing, you know we have it on lock around the globe. Dandy Lion: The Black Dandy and Street Style, by Shantrelle P. Lewis, captures the exuberant subculture of Afrocentric dandyism from its roots as a form of rebellion in Age of Enlightenment England and the Belgian Congo, where rebels adapted the dress of European colonists in order to blur the lines between the impoverished and the oppressors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, the tradition of dandyism is alive and well throughout the African Diaspora; hip-hop leads the way, with an artistic emphasis on dressing that takes the love of male sartorial splendor and mixing colors and patterns to the highest of heights. Available on Amazon.com for $32, it\u2019s a fashion lover\u2019s dream.\n\n@ozwald_boateng via Instagram Close-up image of Tribal Embroidered Tie (OzwaldBoateng.com) @ozwald_boateng via Instagram 1 / 3\n\nWant to take home a black panther?

The reader follows Jenkins, now 25, just a few miles but a lifetime away to New York City, where she is eager to land bylines at the world\u2019s top publications.\n\nAlong the way, Jerkins takes the reader to deeply personal and, at times, uncomfortable places. She chronicles her struggles with dating and heartbreak, unflinchingly guides her reader through a personal surgical procedure and wrestles with a variety of different gazes: that of white men and white women, but also of potential lovers, of her host families and other people in Japan and Russia, of her black female peers and, most important, her own evolving view of herself.\n\nThe work-in-progress nature shows at times. Gay mentioned in a recent interview with Jerkins in Elle magazine that \u201cthere are places where I wanted [Jerkins] to push her conclusions further,\u201d and Jerkins\u2019 approach to certain topics likely won\u2019t be appreciated by everyone. Jerkins\u2019 feminism includes unbowed self-advocacy, and some readers may find fault with the way she calls out specific people and their behaviors, including some high-profile black women. For her part, Jerkins says she \u201cstands by the book and everything I wrote in it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPutting it all out there, she said in conversation with The Glow Up, is the whole point.\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: This interview has been edited and condensed.]\n\n\n\nOn writing about having labiaplasty\u2014and other taboo subjects:\n\n\u201cI was worried about what my mother would think, what my father would think, the church in which I was raised would think. The men whom I haven\u2019t even met, I wondered what they would think\u2014would I be unattractive to them?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe whole point of the book was just to lay it all out there on the table, and not with the aim that you agree with me, but that you at least have an understanding of where I\u2019m coming from. I probably look at certain chapters where I talk about dating or where I talk about my labiaplasty, and I\u2019ll look at it and I\u2019ll still feel that reverberation\u2014like, you had to go there?\u201d\n\nOn revealing the more unflattering parts of her experiences:\n\n\u201cWriting about yourself isn\u2019t supposed to be easy. Anytime you feel nervous about writing about something, I believe that\u2019s when you know you\u2019re on the right track. ... I had to keep telling myself, \u2018Stop worrying about that invisible person and whether or not they\u2019re going to be freaked out by it or whatever. Think about the people that might read a little bit more expansively because of what you\u2019ve said. Or don\u2019t think of anybody. Write what needs to be said. What you want it to say.\u2019 That\u2019s what I had to do.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the pain of being called \u201cintimidating\u201d:\n\n\u201cThe worst thing someone can say about me in a personal sense, because I\u2019ve heard other media outlets say this about me, is that I\u2019m intimidating. Sometimes it hurts more than someone calling me a bitch or cunt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know that as soon as they utter that word, I think about all of the times where I have been pressured, subconsciously or not, implicitly or explicitly, to shrink\u2014or be completely shut off from romantic love for the rest of my life.\n\n\u201cIt makes me feel so large and like there\u2019s no room for anyone else. \u2026 It makes me feel like they\u2019re saying, \u2018Well, there\u2019s no room for me in your life.\u2019 How can I even fit, metaphorically or figuratively, in your life, in this conversation? It\u2019s like a rejection, but it\u2019s also like, \u2018Stay the way you are.\u2019 And it\u2019s like, but if you\u2019re telling me, and so many other people are telling me this, then where does that leave me?\u201d\n\nOn receiving her first vibrator\u2014from her mother:\n\n\u201cWhen I tell you that my body was on fire\u2014I had all of this kinetic energy and my heart just got broken. I didn\u2019t know what happened. I just wanted to be touched and I wasn\u2019t getting it anywhere. There were moments when I was just waking up in the middle of the night just like, it felt crazy. And my mother was kind enough to be like, \u2018I\u2019m going to help you because, what else can I do?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe knew that I was going through it. And it\u2019s a very taboo subject in Christian circles, but it helped me because it helped me to take control of my sexuality. And also it helped me to avoid situations that were not going to be healthy for me.\n\n\u201cNow that I\u2019m an adult, my mother and I have talks about men and everything like that more vividly and more explicitly. It was powerful for me because it let me know that she cared. It let me know that I could talk to her about pretty much anything. When I had my labioplasty, she was there; when my stepfather passed, she was there. There [were] so many moments when she was there.\n\n\u201cI think people have to recognize that black mothers, they aren\u2019t all the same. But in terms of my black mother, she was trying to do stuff [that] when I was younger might seem like, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s trying to make you assimilate to something.\u2019 But she just knows how the world is, and how cruel the world is to black girls.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn being progressive and Christian:\n\n\u201cI think what is important for people of color who identify as Christian to do is to divorce themselves from a white male lens. A lot of times, I\u2019ll meet Christian people and their politics aren\u2019t there. And then I\u2019ll meet people who I\u2019m really great with politically, and they\u2019re agnostic or atheist, and I\u2019m like, well. ... I think the thing for me is it takes deeper investigation on my part to say, \u2018How do I think about Christianity in a liberating sense away from a white male lens?\u2019 And that may be more self-study and less relying on preachers to tell me everything.\u201d\n\nOn how her faith influences her ambition:\n\n\u201cI have to remind myself that if it\u2019s true that what it says\u2014that God knew before I was even born; that he stitched every part of me before I was even conceived of\u2014then why am I going to deny myself? When I think of the professional endeavors ... I think back [to] getting published in the New Yorker at 23 years old. Where did I have the nerve to think [I could do] that?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I used to teach, people, they would say, \u2018Well, how did you know you were ready? Did you say, \u201cOh, I\u2019m going to write 20 articles before I pitch there?\u201d\u2019 And I just said, \u2018I don\u2019t ask for permission in anything that I do in this world, because no one is going to just give it to me. What I can do is come to you with this opportunity that I want. Say, these are the reasons why I can do it.\u2019 And you take from that what you will.\u201d\n\nOn impostor syndrome and the audacity of being on the cover of your own book:\n\n\u201cThere was belief, but don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014when those pieces were, in fact, published, I had very terrible impostor syndrome. I\u2019m talking about looking at my byline, tracing each letter of my name with my eyes and still not believing that I wrote that. ... There were many times with this book ...with the anticipation of it all, [thinking,] \u2018How dare I think that I can write what I just wrote? Where did that type of courage come from?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEven now, when I look at the cover of my book, I think, \u2018How dare I look so proud of my own book? How dare I even be on it?\u2019 But I think what I have to emphasize is that I\u2019ve always been afraid. I\u2019ve always been a worryful person; I just don\u2019t let it overtake the courage.\u201d\n\nOn living in an unapologetically black space:\n\n\u201cI think Harlem is the only place where I\u2019m not so hyperconscious about white people. I know that if I go to the nearest store and I got a scarf on my head, no one\u2019s going to treat me any differently. I will still be acknowledged. ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHarlem is different for me, because it\u2019s the only place where I\u2019m not second-guessing any type of mode of behavior that I have. Despite gentrification, I\u2019m not worried about the white person next to me. I know I\u2019m going to be acknowledged regardless of what I have on my head, what it is that I\u2019m wearing. Nobody\u2019s going to deny me proper treatment.\u201d\n\nOn growing into, and accepting, a desire to be beautiful:\n\n\u201cI think my conception of beauty happened [in] two different ways: One was when I saw Zadie Smith in person, and I was like, she looks exactly as she does in the pictures. A part of me was like, \u2018Oh my God. I\u2019m jealous! She\u2019s stunning!\u2019 And then when I got on the cover of my book, I became much more hyperaware of how I looked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was like, it wasn\u2019t just enough for me to be a great writer, which is what I strive to be all the time. But I wanted people to say that \u2018she\u2019s beautiful\u2019 as well, because that\u2019s the culture we live in. And also because I\u2019ve denied myself acknowledgment of my beauty.\n\n\u201cI feel empowered putting on a bold lipstick. I feel empowered when I try on a new eye shadow in a color that I never thought that I would really like, to be able to indulge in that way, because I never really did that for myself. And if someone acknowledges that attention that I spend on myself, then so be it. It makes me feel good!\n\n\u201cAnd I want to be able to say that with confidence and not think that is, you know, that\u2019s going to be detrimental to my art. Because this is such a personal book, that\u2019s why I\u2019m like\u2014I think that I\u2019m noticing the relationship. It definitely kicked into heavy gear when I was on the cover of my own book.

I feel like they think I owe them something and I hate having them trail after me all night because of a cocktail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell debt collectors are nothing if not persistent.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what these men are, debt collectors seeking payment on a debt you\u2019ve incurred.\n\nBecause you have incurred a debt Kali.\n\nIt\u2019s a dirty thing to say because it makes the whole mating process a dirty dirty business but you do owe these men something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy accepting that $8 cocktail, they\u2019ve at the very least paid for a bit of your time and a little small talk while you finish said drink.

Walk with money.\n\nKrystal from Baltimore, MD asks:\n\n\n\nIs there any truth to the idea that the vagina is self-cleaning?\n\n*sigh*\n\nYes and no.\n\nYes, if we\u2019re talking about the medical definition of vagina. So if when people say the vagina is self-cleaning they mean the vagina as in the elastic, muscular canal that makes up part of the female reproductive system, then yes, that is absolutely self-cleaning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe tissue that makes up that canal is also very very delicate and wouldn\u2019t thrive with the use of cleansing washes like Summer\u2019s Eve.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re telling people \u201cthe vagina is self-cleaning\u201d as the reason for not washing everything else, meaning your vulva i.e. the external genital organs, you\u2019re just nasty. You absolutely should wash your ass everyday.\n\nAnd while we\u2019re at it, you should use shampoo every once in a while too. Co-washing your hair is like using lotion as your body wash. It\u2019ll seal in the moisture but it\u2019ll also seal in the dirt too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIJS\n\nChristian from Harlem, NY asks:\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite movie?\n\nMy favorite movie hasn\u2019t been made yet.\n\nHollywood and Oprah are always green-lighting movies about pivotal moments in our history (so racism) or about monumental African-Americans whether they be activists or sports heroes or artists; and lots of comedies and Black men in drag but my favorite movies are always about those quiet moments in-between interesting times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd frankly there aren\u2019t enough of them.\n\nBut the few there have been has resonated with me in a profound way. Spike Lee\u2019s Crooklyn about a young girl and her family during a summer in 1973 immediately comes to mind. It was tragic, in the way life can sometimes be, but not sensationalistic; funny, again like life, but not foolish.\n\nSo the movie I want to see made would be a \u201cslice of life\u201d work. The focus would be less on the plot and more about the characters. I\u2019m particularly desperate for a character study of two men. Black men. Father and son. Because I\u2019ve never seen that be the focus of any movie and the idea of it fascinates me. I\u2019m neither a father nor a son but I\u2019m so interested in the dynamic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is that moment like when he realizes his father isn\u2019t a superhero? And fallible? And a hypocrite?\n\nWhat is that moment like when one truly lets the other down?\n\nWhat are those moments like in the car, on their way to places?\n\nWhat\u2019s their secret language? What\u2019s said and unsaid?\n\nWhat does conflict look like between them?\n\nWhat\u2019s that moment when the son realizes he\u2019s become his father after all?\n\nSomeone should write this screenplay.

Even the professionally offended.\n\n2. I\u2019m no feminist. Nothing in me believes in equality of the sexes or even equitable treatment for women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe get our periods.

Barnum of fashion who has turned his distinct point of view into a budding fashion empire, debuted his latest collaboration with Jimmy Choo Tuesday night. Abloh, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Kanye West\u2019s and a Grammy nominee for his work on Watch the Throne, was propelled to the forefront of fashion via association with the Kardashian family by grace of the king-making power of their social media influence\u2014influence that has also served designers like Olivier Rousteing of Balmain, who, like Abloh, is on the rise as one of the new rulers of fashion.\n\nWhat Abloh has is a keen understanding of consumer desire\u2014a yearning to be savvy enough to incorporate high-art motifs into closet staples like boots and T-shirts, along with a craving for street cred. His Off-White label provides both, producing $1,700 satin pussy-bow blouses with ties that dust the floor, and white plastic boots with the words \u201cFor Walking\u201d or \u201cOff-White\u201d in black safety-sign lettering up the side. Even the label\u2019s logo-decaled smartphone cases retail for a cool $95 and seem to be in the palms of private school kids from coast to coast.\n\nAlboh\u2019s style is entertaining and fun, but his offerings have that kind of art-world brevity about them where, even if the high-ticket items are a joke on the buyer, it\u2019s better to be in on the joke than not to get it at all. It\u2019s exactly this kind of savvy marketing that has won the designer collaborations with brands as diverse as Ikea and famed artists like Takashi Murakami, while Off-White is a favorite among top models, luxury-fashion editors, the hip-hop crowd and those who want to feel hip by association.\n\n\n\nJimmy Choo via You Tube\n\nAbloh\u2019s newest collaborative collection, Off-White \u2105 Jimmy Choo, brings together all the elements of his fascinations: art, fashion, and \u201980s and \u201990s iconic cool. On its website, Jimmy Choo posted that the collection was inspired by the late Princess Diana, an interesting muse, given that we are all waiting with bated breath to see how Meghan Markle will leave her stamp on royal style.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also a deft move on Abloh\u2019s part; last November he was the first black designer to receive a British Fashion Council Award for Urban Luxe Brand. Princess Di and urban streetwear could not be farther part\u2014although the princess was known to put on a leotard and tights for roller-skating around the halls of Buckingham Palace.\n\nWhy this move toward regal attire and ladylike fare is so cunning on Abloh\u2019s part is that, in true P.T. Barnum style, it\u2019s a three-ring-circus. Just when you thought it was just sneakers and cellphone covers, here comes something entirely new to capture your imagination.\n\nSandra Choi, Kendall Jenner and Virgil Abloh (Jimmy Choo via Instagram) Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid (Jimmy Choo via Instagram) 1 / 2\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe party to fete his Spring/Summer 2018 ready-to-wear collection and Off-White \u2105 Jimmy Choo, both of which will be in stores this week, drew an A-list crowd of models like Bella and Gigi Hadid, Kaia Gerber, Kendall Jenner and Naomi Campbell, decked out in the Princess Di-inspired collection along with the shoes. The clothes were sophisticated and subdued for the most part\u2014garden party chintz, sharply cut suits with walking shorts and cropped jackets with lapels that jutted forward like the bow of the royal yacht\u2014while stilettos were covered in clear PVC cocoons or ruched with tulle. Tulle, that most feminine and genteel of fabrics, was also applied to thigh-high boots, casting a kind of fairy-tale softness to the look.\n\nOf the unlikely brand matchup, Abloh told Women\u2019s Wear Daily:\n\nIt was an idea I had.

The celebrity DJ-model-producer (and much more) shifted the paradigm in our favor in 2006 when she founded Black Girls Rock!, the award show and nonprofit organization that has since earned worldwide acclaim.\n\nFittingly, Bond literally holds the trademark to \u201cBlack Girl Magic\u201d\u2014a phrase she recently discovered may have originated in friend and author Joan Morgan\u2019s \u201990s hip-hop feminist tome When Chickenheads Come Home to Roost. Bond loves that the expression has become a recent addition to our common lexicon about black womanhood, as she has made it her mission to help as many girls find their magic as possible.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to know everything, but you might know somebody that knows something else, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been able to do [with] Black Girls Rock!\u2014I\u2019ve been able to tap into our village to help me bring this to life and do this work.\n\nNow eBay is recognizing and supporting Bond\u2019s efforts by partnering with Black Girls Rock! for an epic inaugural auction to raise funds for the organization in honor of Black History Month. Launched on Feb. 5, the auction features such gems as a pair of worn and signed ballet shoes from Misty Copeland, coveted red-carpet access to the next Black Girls Rock! award show and signed copies of Bond\u2019s upcoming Black Girls Rock! book, which debuts on Feb. 27 and is already the No. 1 book in preorders on Amazon.com\u2014as well as the first prize to sell out on the eBay auction. As Bond tells The Glow Up:\n\nYou know, I\u2019m just really grateful\u2014it\u2019s exciting to see that people are receiving it so well. But also, it speaks to the importance of the message continuing\u2014the need for the message ... In 2006, when I started Black Girls Rock!, there wasn\u2019t this celebration, acknowledgment [or] inclusion of black women\u2019s narratives, stories, beauty, diversity, nuances\u2014it just wasn\u2019t there in media\u2014in fact, it was completely the opposite, if anything. And so to see where the world has come to now, in this time, and to see all this \u201cBlack Girl Magic\u201d surfacing\u2014or people discovering [it]\u2014it\u2019s just an incredible thing, to know that Black Girls Rock! was very much at the forefront of this movement. It means a lot, but I don\u2019t get fooled by trends ... I feel that the work needs to continue there, and I know that we have to continue to push our message, our narrative, and keep our presence in the forefront. We matter and our voices matter, and our accomplishments matter, our contributions matter, our achievements matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupporting the accomplishments and achievements of future generations is at the heart of Black Girls Rock!, and 100 percent of proceeds from the auction will go back into the organization\u2019s programs, like the Black Girls Lead conference and camps, which have yielded proven results through mentorship, as Bond tells us:\n\nWe are really giving girls tools that they need to empower themselves to take their best to their \u201cbestest\u201d; to go to their next level. And so it\u2019s been really successful. We have a lot of incredible girls that have gone through our programs that stay connected with us, that are now in college. Some of them are graduating [and] going into the business world now. So you know, just to see this work over this time, and to see girls that we\u2019ve literally been surrogate mothers to, in a sense, grow into these incredible young women, it\u2019s been amazing to see.\n\nTo understand the potential impact of a juggernaut like eBay joining forces with Black Girls Rock!, to date, eBay for Charity has raised nearly $810 million for participating charities, raising $84 million in 2017 alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe auction is live until Feb. 15, and the following items and experiences are still up for grabs:\n\nBallet shoes worn and signed by Misty Copeland.\n\n\n\nVIP Experience at the 2018 Black Girls Rock! Awards in New York\u2014you will walk the red carpet alongside stars and have VIP seating to watch the entire show with some of the hottest celebs!\n\n\n\nNot in the market for some of the bigger-ticket items in the auction? EBay for Charity and Black Girls Rock! also partnered with fashion-accessory brand Pintrill to create exclusive enamel pins that are being sold on the platform throughout February. One says \u201cBlack Girls Rock!\u201d and the other says \u201cWESLAY.\u201d Each pin is available for $15, or you can purchase the pair for $25. You can also add an additional donation to your purchase during checkout. Remember\u2014100 percent of proceeds benefit Black Girls Rock!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBond hopes that this auction will be the first of many as she continues to grow Black Girls Rock! and ensure that #BlackGirlMagic remains more than a catchphrase, hashtag or trend. She\u2019s constantly strategizing new ways to do the work of elevating us\u2014and hopes that more will do the same:\n\nIt\u2019s easier to do the work than we think it is. And I think that sometimes people get so caught up in the idea [that] it takes so much to start a charity or start a mentoring program. And it really just takes whatever knowledge and skill that you have, using that to empower the next person. You don\u2019t have to know everything, but you might know somebody that knows something else, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been able to do in this time of building Black Girls Rock!\u2014both the award show and the nonprofit. I\u2019ve been able to kind of tap into the community and tap into our village to help me bring this to life and help me do this work. And I think that eBay has joined our village, and I think that\u2019s the beautiful part about this partnership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: The Black Girls Rock! auction is live now through Feb. 15; Pintrill pins are available throughout the month of February.

Some great moments deserve a sequel, and we\u2019ve therefore done some deep investigative journalism to get the details on our favorite look of Grammy night 2018.\n\nAs previously posted, Eve was our hands-down winner of this year\u2019s awards ceremony, despite not being nominated this year (sorry, Beyonc\u00e9). Thanks to our intrepid, talented and well-connected Gizmodo Media Group family (we\u2019re talking about you, Victor Amos!), we were able to get the scoop on Eve\u2019s incredible Grammys style\u2014and, most important, how to imitate it.\n\nLet\u2019s start with that gorgeous face: Makeup artist Ernesto Casillas has been working with Eve since the promotional tour for Barbershop and counts her among his favorite clients. For her Grammys look, he rose to the occasion while not even knowing what the star would be wearing, as he tells The Glow Up:\n\nFor the look, I knew right away that I wanted to keep it pretty and somewhat classic. We didn\u2019t know exactly what outfit she was going to wear up until right before she went on, so I wanted to keep the colors neutral and paint her in a way that she would feel confident and pretty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe multihyphenate added \u201cred-carpet host\u201d to her title this year, co-hosting the evening\u2019s Grammy Red Carpet Live with Entertainment Tonight\u2019s Nancy O\u2019Dell, Kevin Frazier and Keltie Knight. To make sure the star stayed stellar-looking throughout the day, Casillas had a strategy:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCasillas also wanted to make sure the focus stayed where it belonged while his star was speaking on the red carpet:\n\nEve usually likes to opt for a nude pink lip, but I knew I wanted a midtone lip, since she was wearing a suit and would be interviewing people. I wanted the mouth to also be a focus, but not too dark, either. I lined the lips with a deep berry color and filled in with a lighter, peachier shade. I used Kat Von D\u2019s \u201cLolita\u201d lipstick and some nude gloss over that.\n\nAnd lest we forget that Eve opted to wear not one, but two d\u00e9colletage-baring blazers during the evening, Casillas certainly didn\u2019t, using Gleam Body Bronzing Lotion in shade Deep Gold on her chest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as for that mane of perfectly tousled waves Eve was rocking over her shoulder? You can thank hairstylist Angela Christine, who\u2019s been working with Eve for over seven years and also styles her for The Talk. Christine tells The Glow Up:\n\nShe\u2019s an amazing person to work with, [and] really makes the job easy. Eve loves strong and effortless, so once she chose the suit, she wanted something that felt relaxed and beautiful at the same time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that deciding on Eve\u2019s style was effortless; Christine was ready for a big chop, but the star felt otherwise. \u201cWe actually went back and forth about the hair. ... I wanted to do a shorter, edgy cut, but she was serious about keeping it long,\u201d Christine says.\n\nAnd as for that color? Christine says that she and Eve have been playing with both warm and cool tones lately, and the honey tone was actually done well in advance. The extensions actually came from Christine\u2019s own line, Conscious Curls, in a texture called Strength, which closely resembles natural hair blown out. \u201cThis [allowed] for lots of fullness and volume, which we both loved,\u201d Christine says.\n\nChristine then used a medium-barrel ceramic curling iron to achieve those gorgeous loose waves, strategically curling in opposite directions for a messier look. She then used Ouai Rose Oil and Kenra Texturizing Taffy to create even more separation and texture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristine\u2014who, in addition to working for The Talk, also has a salon in West Hollywood, Calif., and consults for other beauty brands\u2014is releasing a series of affirming children\u2019s books called the Pretty Curls Club.

I was hittin' a Netflix and chill before it was even a thing. Of course, I was doing that by myself usually where I'd fire up Netflix and chill on my couch and watch whatever movie I or the mysterious people who have stolen my password had queued up. Some very weird people have stolen my password. Also, in case you don't know (though I'm sure you do), \"Netflix and chill\" is the updated version of \"movie night\" or \"making it a Blockbuster night\" dates where you hoped to watch the opening credits of a movie with rather randy partner, eschew that movie to make your own (heheheh), then have the participating party gone by the time the credits for the original movie start rolling so that you could get some rest for the kickball game you had going the next morning. That's a good night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNetflix, I appreciate you. But alas I have a gripe; you are a liar.\n\nDon't look at me like that, Netflix. You are. Own it.\n\nActually, before we get to that, I have a few questions. Actually, I just have one. How do I get my account back to a reasonable standing so that the movies you all suggest for me don't all feature star Keith Robinson, Christian Keyes, Essence Atkins, Leon, or Darrin Dewitt Henson who is now remarkably playing the role of father to college kids. Seriously, it's getting embarrassing. You know how I said that somebody has stolen my Netflix password? Right. That's messed up. But whats more messed up is that they can see what you suggest for me too. This means that they know I fell down that bad Black movie rabbit hole and I can't seem to get out. Who the hell knew Keith Robinson starred in so many movies? If he keeps this up, he's going to get a Clifton Powell Bad Black Movie Lifetime Achievement Award before he's 40. But this gets right to the heart of my issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou have a \"Popular On Netflix\" list of movies that gets populated every time I log in. Why is Keith Robinson in so many \"Popular On Netflix\" movies?\n\nAnd you know good and gotdamn well that You Got Served is not popular on Netflix. That movie isn't even popular in Omarion's household. Nor is Squeeze, a movie from 1994 that I'm pretty sure nobody would know exists if you all didn't tell me it was popular on Netflix. I watched this movie, beeteedubs, and its fucking terrible. Dysfunctional Friends? Really? Are you kidding me? How is this movie popular on Netflix? How SWAY? It's not, that's how. You are a liar. You are lying to me every single time I log in.\n\nLook, I'm not math surgeon, but I know that there are something like 70 million Netflix subscribers. Since it's a paid service, I'm guessing that the vast majority of those people are not Black people. Just guessing here, feel free to tell me that I'm wrong. Assuming that I'm right, though, you are trying to tell me that ENOUGH WHITE AND OTHER PEOPLE like Keith Robinson to make his movies popular on Netflix? I think you're a liar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAre you telling me that if I go to my mother's house - she's white - and log into her Netflix account, her Popular list is going to look like mine? It won't feature Days of Thunder instead of Drumline 2??? No Sandra Bullock listed, but Essence Atkins movies are. Aight, fam.\n\nOh, nigga, did you all SEE DRUMLINE 2? It got panned by EVERYBODY when it was on. How the fuck did that make it to being popular? It wasn't even popular when it was FREE! Shit, if it wasn't for Black Twitter raking it over the coals and hashtagging it to high hell, it's entirely possible that Drumline 2 would be scrubbed Fahrenheit 451 style.\n\nHey, Netflix, I read Ray Bradbury novels and love Ayn Rand (seriously, have you read Anthem? Netflix, it's life altering). How you trynna play a brotha? I'm not stupid. I know what a popular movie is. Pitch Perfect? Yes. The damn sequel did like $70 mil in its first week. Movies starring Ryan Gosling? Sure. If you tell me The Notebook is popular I'm buying it. Even family movies like Brave and Toy Story 3 or Finding Nemo. Sure. I've sat my kids down to watch more than my fair share of animated features to kill a few hours. Hell, I've seen both Mulan movies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of that shit is ever on my personal Popular list. What gives, b? All of those movies are in your library of movies? But they're not popular. But motherfucking CRU is. All Things Fall Apart starring Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson is. N-word please.\n\nYou are a liar, Netflix. I don't believe you one bit that those movies are ACTUALLY popular on Netflix. I think you looked at the movies I may or may not have watched and tossed them into your algorithm and tried to tell me that those are the movies that folks are checking out on Netflix. There all these news stories about Black Twitter, how come nobody's writing about Black Netflix. Oh, that's because you all skew what movies end up in my home!\n\nWhite people don't know Keith Robinson, Netflix. Why do I have to? Did I know his name when he was in Dreamgirls? No. I didn't. Do I know? Yes, because he's in every other movie you try to tell me is popular. I'm sure he's a fine person, but there's a reason he's only showing up in my household.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStop lying.

Barnum of fashion who has turned his distinct point of view into a budding fashion empire, debuted his latest collaboration with Jimmy Choo Tuesday night. Abloh, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Kanye West\u2019s and a Grammy nominee for his work on Watch the Throne, was propelled to the forefront of fashion via association with the Kardashian family by grace of the king-making power of their social media influence\u2014influence that has also served designers like Olivier Rousteing of Balmain, who, like Abloh, is on the rise as one of the new rulers of fashion.\n\nWhat Abloh has is a keen understanding of consumer desire\u2014a yearning to be savvy enough to incorporate high-art motifs into closet staples like boots and T-shirts, along with a craving for street cred. His Off-White label provides both, producing $1,700 satin pussy-bow blouses with ties that dust the floor, and white plastic boots with the words \u201cFor Walking\u201d or \u201cOff-White\u201d in black safety-sign lettering up the side. Even the label\u2019s logo-decaled smartphone cases retail for a cool $95 and seem to be in the palms of private school kids from coast to coast.\n\nAlboh\u2019s style is entertaining and fun, but his offerings have that kind of art-world brevity about them where, even if the high-ticket items are a joke on the buyer, it\u2019s better to be in on the joke than not to get it at all. It\u2019s exactly this kind of savvy marketing that has won the designer collaborations with brands as diverse as Ikea and famed artists like Takashi Murakami, while Off-White is a favorite among top models, luxury-fashion editors, the hip-hop crowd and those who want to feel hip by association.\n\n\n\nJimmy Choo via You Tube\n\nAbloh\u2019s newest collaborative collection, Off-White \u2105 Jimmy Choo, brings together all the elements of his fascinations: art, fashion, and \u201980s and \u201990s iconic cool. On its website, Jimmy Choo posted that the collection was inspired by the late Princess Diana, an interesting muse, given that we are all waiting with bated breath to see how Meghan Markle will leave her stamp on royal style.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also a deft move on Abloh\u2019s part; last November he was the first black designer to receive a British Fashion Council Award for Urban Luxe Brand. Princess Di and urban streetwear could not be farther part\u2014although the princess was known to put on a leotard and tights for roller-skating around the halls of Buckingham Palace.\n\nWhy this move toward regal attire and ladylike fare is so cunning on Abloh\u2019s part is that, in true P.T. Barnum style, it\u2019s a three-ring-circus. Just when you thought it was just sneakers and cellphone covers, here comes something entirely new to capture your imagination.\n\nSandra Choi, Kendall Jenner and Virgil Abloh (Jimmy Choo via Instagram) Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid (Jimmy Choo via Instagram) 1 / 2\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe party to fete his Spring/Summer 2018 ready-to-wear collection and Off-White \u2105 Jimmy Choo, both of which will be in stores this week, drew an A-list crowd of models like Bella and Gigi Hadid, Kaia Gerber, Kendall Jenner and Naomi Campbell, decked out in the Princess Di-inspired collection along with the shoes. The clothes were sophisticated and subdued for the most part\u2014garden party chintz, sharply cut suits with walking shorts and cropped jackets with lapels that jutted forward like the bow of the royal yacht\u2014while stilettos were covered in clear PVC cocoons or ruched with tulle. Tulle, that most feminine and genteel of fabrics, was also applied to thigh-high boots, casting a kind of fairy-tale softness to the look.\n\nOf the unlikely brand matchup, Abloh told Women\u2019s Wear Daily:\n\nIt was an idea I had.

It\u2019s also a city where your coat conveys status as much as, if not more than, your clothes; those wet suits Hunte used as underpinnings may have been a nod also to the one-piece ski suits so ubiquitous in the Mile-High City.\n\nHunter has a unique vocabulary when it comes to coats that draws equally from cinched, belted and chained Italian police uniforms; Marcy Projects street style; and the glamour of old Hollywood movies. Hunte\u2019s women make grand entrances and dramatic exits; one particular standout this season was a trench coat with fox-fur patchwork.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what Hunte does best is updating and reworking his own signature details and patterns.

Her rich roots and passion for culinary arts were inspired by cooking with her grandmother at a very young age; years later, she\u2019d moonlight in the hospitality industry after earning credentials from Eastern Michigan University to be a social worker.\n\n\u201cI always worked at least two jobs, and if one of them was cooking, I was very happy,\u201d says Scott.\n\nAfter getting laid off from her position as a social worker\u2014and eventually hitting rock bottom\u2014she explored opportunities in the culinary field.\n\n\u201cI cannot say that [culinary] was really my choice; it was very organic. The only other thing I loved was food and cooking. I lost my home, car, everything\u2014that\u2019s how my first real cooking job came about. I decided to work on a major cruise line.\u201d\n\nFour years after her full-time transition into the hospitality industry, Scott enrolled in culinary school\u2014and quickly learned how complicated the business can be. An internship with the Food Network provided her initial exposure to culinary media, food styling and networking with established peers, eventually allowing her to gain culinary clients of her own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShortly after, she pursued her master\u2019s degree in entertainment business from Full Sail University and transitioned into a career as a culinary producer: a multifaceted position that dabbles in all areas on set to run a smooth production. Her experience now includes being the culinary producer of season 2 of Bravo\u2019s hit television show Chef Roble and Company, Throwdown With Bobby Flay and the Cooking Channel.\n\nProgressing her way through a multilayered industry, she landed more exceptional positions, working alongside The Chew\u2019s Carla Hall at the Barbados Food, Wine and Rum Festival and becoming a food stylist for Michael Symon and Daphne Oz.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlossoming in the culinary industry has been a blessing, but despite her qualifications, Scott has experienced disappointment in the field she loves, being passed up for many opportunities. She explains:\n\nI vividly remember being called by the hiring manager of a major network with excitement in her voice, [calling me] the \u201cperfect candidate.\u201d I was told that I\u2019d be moving to the next round of interviews, and then I didn\u2019t get a call back. Inquiring about the follow-up, I was met with her less-than-enthusiastic\u2014almost bothered\u2014tone. The job was given to a young woman who just finished her internship\u2014she was white. That\u2019s just one example, and there are quite a few\u2014each one heartbreaking and disconcerting. The takeaway for me was that when something new or different is happening, it\u2019s always met with resistance. I always knew that it was my personal mission to end these cycles by breaking down these barriers. I later learned that like any building, there\u2019s ways to get in other than the front door; I began to curate my career, diversify my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and make myself marketable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd she did\u2014Scott is the founder of SheChef, a culinary mentorship and leadership program for aspiring women chefs and professionals.\n\nIn a male-dominated industry, chef Elle noted that food styling and culinary production are not. \u201cThese are probably two of few areas dominated by women, [but] women of color remain a minority in these areas.\u201d She cites culinary producers like like Ma\u2019at Zachary and owners of Powerhouse Productions Rochelle Brown and Sonia Armstead as excellent examples in the industry, while Rosecleer-Marie Powell and Sade Aguila are two of many slaying the food styling game.\n\nBut Scott\u2019s rise in the culinary world was interrupted by her diagnosis with stage 1C, grade 3 ovarian cancer\u2014a cancerous tumor resting on her right ovary. Enduring six rounds of chemotherapy over a five-month period and laparoscopic surgery removing her ovary and right fallopian tube, she experienced emotional and physical changes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI dealt with perpetual nausea but never once vomited, extreme fatigue and worked all about a total of eight days within that five-month period,\u201d she says. \u201cI was on a large amount of steroids, getting medication\u2014Taxol and Carboplatin\u2014intravenously and gained 23 pounds that I\u2019m still struggling to lose. I couldn\u2019t eat much unless it was salty; lost all of my hair, even my eyelashes. I had my last round of chemo at the end of January 2017.\u201d\n\nShe credited cancer with curing her of \u201cpersonal vanity\u201d and opts to spend more time being \u201cpresent,\u201d valuing life a bit more. This January will mark a year in remission, but whenever she experiences aches, pains and changes that aren\u2019t documented as side effects, she\u2019s a bit skeptical.\n\n\u201cAnyone having unattended health issues: GO TO THE DOCTOR!\u201d she urges. \u201cI feel like people of color, especially black Americans, have issues with approaching health care in this country\u2014not that I blame them one bit. As it relates to cancer and most other diseases, early detection can and possibly will save your life. Genetic testing is a new tool for detection; request it and accept it if offered. As clich\u00e9d as it sounds, stay positive. I believe healing begins in the mind and resonates through the body.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScott advises fighters and survivors to embrace their feelings\u2014good or bad. Despite others\u2019 perspectives, take as much rest as needed and do as many things you enjoy as you can. \u201cCancer is what you had or have, not who you are,\u201d she says.

Add a DJ, film crews, social media influencers like June Ambrose, Blake Scott, Saint Jhn and every major fashion magazine, and you\u2019re on the road to what could be a successful season.\n\nRomeo Hunte via YouTube\n\nBut showmanship is not to be confused with craftsmanship. Hunte\u2019s collection does not depend on hype; rather, it depends on finely worked jackets with well-thought-out detailing like detachable sleeves, reversible linings and detachable collars in combinations that are at once surprising and surprisingly wearable.\n\nFor his 2018 Fall/Winter collection, the designer said that his inspiration was Aspen, Colo., a city that is cloaked in posh ski resorts, five-star restaurants, world-class think tanks and luxury shopping that\u2019s as intense as any black diamond ski run. It\u2019s also a city where your coat conveys status as much as, if not more than, your clothes; those wet suits Hunte used as underpinnings may have been a nod also to the one-piece ski suits so ubiquitous in the Mile-High City.\n\nHunter has a unique vocabulary when it comes to coats that draws equally from cinched, belted and chained Italian police uniforms; Marcy Projects street style; and the glamour of old Hollywood movies. Hunte\u2019s women make grand entrances and dramatic exits; one particular standout this season was a trench coat with fox-fur patchwork.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what Hunte does best is updating and reworking his own signature details and patterns. He is known for dressing celebs like Beyonc\u00e9, Halle Berry and Zendaya in buffalo-check ponchos; this season, clear PVC was added as an overlay on the checked pattern to give this soft staple fabric both edge and a modern dimension. (You\u2019ll likely be seeing a lot of PVC this season; it was also utilized by Virgil Abloh in his capsule collection for Jimmy Choo that debuted at New York Fashion Week on Tuesday.)\n\nWhat we saw this season was a modern woman\u2019s uniform for traveling exploring.

It was initially primarily based on donations but is now moving into sponsorships and collaborations. It\u2019s even launched a Reading Challenge for 2018 and a reading group, which you can join here:\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis Sunday, Jan. 28, Ronke and the Free Black Women\u2019s Library will help launch MFON: Women Photographers of the African Diaspora, a crowdfunded photography book celebrating various iterations of black womanhood.

The brilliant women behind this work are Laylah Amatullah Barrayn and Adama Delphine Fawundu, founding co-editors-in-chief, and Crystal Whaley, deputy editor.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Ronke, both the library and events like these are a necessary next step in expanding the exposure and understanding of black womanhood.\n\n\u201cBlack women are variable and expansive\u2014and, like, different\u2014and there\u2019s really no way to categorize that. Because under the umbrella of black women, we could have a black trans person, or you could have a black person who wears a weave or locs or has a low cut or is skinny or in a wheelchair, you know? And we also have stay-at-home moms and the Wall Street executive. ... There [are] just so many ways to be a black woman.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe adds, \u201cSo, that was part of it, too: just pushing back against this idea that there\u2019s one type of black woman.

At the entrance into the concrete jungle sat the blue Lexus LC 500 used during the film, with slashes from the Black Panther across its hood. Inside the purple-lit studio, seven stunning models posed in bespoke couture designs while standing on a moss-covered stage.

Jordan, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Danai Gurira and Winston Duke\u2014held court on the black carpet. Mingling with guests and posing with the models inspired by their characters, the stars lit up the venue, taking laps around the stage and selfies with guests who dined on Wakanda Patties, made of chickpea and roast yam, and Cricket Tarts, made of chocolate-roasted crickets. Guests sipped signature drinks as artist and DJ Heron Preston kept the crowd\u2014and singer Elle Varner\u2014dancing till long past last call.

Studding the stage with Telfar\u2019s \u201cframily\u201d of musical youths were Dev Hynes tapping the keys; Ian Isiah, aka \u201cBig Shugga,\u201d up front; and Kelela, Oyinda, 070 Shake and Kelsey Lu belting out tunes, along with a surprise appearance by Telfar himself on the mic, crooning a thankful hymn to the customers who give him life.\n\nThis season, the designer showed how his club-kid sensibilities could soar to sophisticated heights. \u201cReady, set, party\u201d was the theme of this collection, which will look at home on rich rockers from Rome to Rio. Think kick-flare jeans cut from selvage denim and decorated with studs, or trimmed with outsize suede cuffs. And, as always, there was his signature sexy cutouts elevating jeans, T-shirts and tunics to a whole new gender-fluid level. The message was sexy for all\u2014as long as you do it your way.\n\nTelfar\u2019s collection is so beloved by so many because it\u2019s meant to be customized\u2014pulled apart so that, as the designer told Vogue, \u201cYou just won\u2019t find leather and denim jeans like ours, or a leather jacket that detaches into a vest.\u201d\n\nKelsey Lu performs at Telfar.

Our ultramodern, minimalist office space\u2014although filled with laughter and camaraderie\u2014drops to meat-locker-level temps when the mercury dips. Not to mention, we\u2019re passionate about beauty.\n\nOur latest outing was to an afternoon with Unilever, the parent company of popular brands Degree, TRESemm\u00e9, SheaMoisture, Suave, Nexxus, Axe, Dove and more\u2014and yes, we\u2019re still asking pointed questions about Dove\u2019s racially questionable dustup last year; we\u2019ll circle back on that conversation when we get answers.\n\nIn a carnival-like atmosphere that was part sideshow and part science, aestheticians demonstrated product while scientists explained the molecular get-down of Unilever\u2019s newest products for face, hair and body.\n\nDid you know that every seven seconds you shower, you use enough water to fill a bottle of wine? I had no idea that much clean water gets used up that fast, mostly while we\u2019re trying to rinse conditioner out of our hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnter Love, Beauty and Planet, a new line of hair and skin-care products engineered to rinse completely clean in half the time of regular conditioners and washes, while ensuring that nothing goes to waste. Most of us don\u2019t know that bottles with labels that are not easily removable are ineligible for recycling and get tossed into garbage dumps; Love, Beauty and Planet\u2019s labels meet this requirement and are 100 percent post-consumer material.\n\nAnd what\u2019s in the bottle? All goodness, with argan and coconut oil formulas and delicious scents. Though you can\u2019t drink them, the idea behind this line is that it\u2019s \u201cfast and fabulous,\u201d carbon neutral, rinses clean quickly and aids in saving 20 percent more water every shower.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDove, well, what can we say? Many of us grew up using its products, and though the company admittedly messed up on that last campaign, some good may have came out of it. Esi Eggleston Bracey, an African-American exec whose hustle and glow over the past decade have made her one of the most powerful in her field, joined Unilever in January as executive vice president and chief operating officer of the company\u2019s North American personal-care business.\n\nIt\u2019s important that we have a seat at the table, not only for gatekeeping our image but, most important, for opening the gates of opportunity when it comes to mentoring and recruiting women of color at the C-suite level of corporate America.\n\nThat said, Dove has both new product and an inclusive, new campaign for DermaSeries, created to treat severely dry skin conditions, including eczema and psoriasis. Ashy folks everywhere, get ready to leave dry skin in the dust; the formulations include rich, hypoallergenic balms that glide on and give an instant glow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs someone who intermittently suffers from eczema, the caring philosophy behind the launch of DermaSeries speaks to the truth that severe skin conditions can rule your life, determining everything from what clothes you can tolerate wearing against your skin to where you\u2019ll go socially because of \u201cgood-skin privilege,\u201d to being able to let someone touch you\u2014even to shake hands or give you a pat on the back. It can be a lot. The women in the campaign\u2014all nonmodels\u2014address conditions that affect 1 in 4 Americans at some point in their lives.\n\n\u201cHi! Want to make a meme?\u201d was the question that came from an unlikely presenter\u2014no more than 15 years old\u2014who made up half of the duo behind the Generation Z consulting firm J\u00fcv. Currently lending their talents to the campaign for Axe body spray, these kids were there to guide us through the feel-good points of the brand\u2019s latest advertising initiative, working in partnership with singer John Legend, among others, to help redefine what it means to be a man, and to help clear the air of toxic ideas about masculinity that have existed in our culture for eons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, wait; Axe is gender-fluid now?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo ... something like that,\u201d the kid answered, before asking if I knew what memes were. Umm, yeah. I do.\n\nFrom a nearby table stocked with props, I put on my carnival disguise of heart-shaped glasses and fuzzy antennas, and the kid directed me to make a happy face, \u201clike you\u2019re ready for prom in January.\u201d While the marketing exec\u2014who looked like a character from The Big Bang Theory\u2014was snapping away pics on the phone for Insta-stories, I got the spiel for Axe Gold\u2019s kinder, gentler version of masculinity.\n\nThis version encourages men to find their magic ... though I don\u2019t know if #ManMagic will become a thing, like #BlackGirlMagic (I checked\u2014it\u2019s not). It also asks the question, \u201cIs it OK for guys to ... cry, be skinny or be the little spoon?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a \u201cMan Box\u201d study Unilever commissioned from global firm Promundo, the statistics tell a compelling story: When young men feel pressure to conform to negative stereotypes, it often leads to unhealthy behavior\u201481 percent turn to bullying, 71 percent to sexual harassment, and 51 percent experience depression.\n\nThe social-change campaign Senior Orientation was created around John Legend and Axe to demonstrate how delving into your creative side can be a way to escape a host of unhealthy behaviors. Legend told Forbes why he joined the campaign, and shared his thoughts on traditional definitions of masculinity:\n\n\n\nIt can be limiting because it\u2019s all based on stereotypes and dated notions of what men are expected to do in society and the truth is men come in all kinds of varieties and their roles are different depending on who they are, how they were raised and what they want to do in life. We need to allow the space for them to be creative and to be an individual and not be overly constrained by what tradition says men are supposed to do. It can be very limiting to both to men and women to assign these roles, and Axe is tapping that for men, given that it\u2019s their target audience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho knew all that was going on in a can of body spray? Here at The Glow Up, we love talking about beauty as a means of both expression and empowerment\u2014from luxury-level tech innovations at a drugstore price to black female executives on the rise\u2014and, certainly, our men\u2019s armpits exuding the sweet smell of a safe space.

I want all the girls watching here, now, to know that a new day is on the horizon!

I\u2019ve heard a lot of Twitter chatter where people have said, \u201cWhere are you? You should be speaking up on these things!\u201d But it makes no sense to speak when you cannot be heard. One hundred and forty characters\u2014that is not how you want to make your mark in the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also shared her perspective on the watershed moment we\u2019re experiencing with the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements. An acknowledged survivor of sexual assault herself, Oprah viewed this moment as a culmination of so many stories, catalyzed by a few not-so-good men:\n\nEverything that\u2019s happened has brought us to this point in time. We\u2019ve been working our way through a lot of repressed pain, anger, shame, and disappointment. And we weren\u2019t honoring our own voices.

It\u2019s just fascinating to me because I always try to look at things from thousands of feet above. . . It has seared into the consciousness a level of awareness that was not there before. That\u2019s the most important thing to me. When Reese Witherspoon can tell her story at the same time as a farm worker in Iowa or a factory worked in Alabama, it says to a person, \u201cOh well, I\u2019ve been putting up with that asshole supervisor for all these years. Maybe it\u2019s time for me to do something too.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those of us starting to navigate middle age, she gives us insight into an authenticity that\u2019s genuinely worth looking forward to:\n\nYou take no shit. None. Not a bit. In your 40s you want to say you take no shit, but you still do. [Editor\u2019s note: This is true.] In your 60s, you take none.

There were thriving and ideological-diverse cities surrounded by expansive and bucolic countrysides. There was modern technology perfectly weaved in to cultural tradition, a melding that was symbiotic instead of antagonistic. And while I didn\u2019t see this happening during the movie, I\u2019m sure Wakanda has amazing bottomless brunches.\n\nUnfortunately, a present-day attempt to recreate Wakanda would be unrealistic. Mainly because we\u2019re roughly 20,000 years behind Wakandan tech. And mostly because we\u2019re too infected with colonization and its myriad residues and peripheral effects. Also, we\u2019re a little short on Vibranium.\n\nOne thing, however, that we can and definitely should start doing is what M\u2019Baku and his Que Dog Jabari Tribe did when encountering a problematic white dude who was speaking when there was no ask or need or purpose for the thoughts and opinions of problematic white dudes.\n\nBark.\n\nNot a purposeless bark. This isn\u2019t a shih tzu barking through the window at a squirrel. Instead this would be an intentional bark. A targeted bark. An overpowering bark. A drowning bark. A Wakandan bark.

Now, just shut up and stand there. Maybe get on your phone and google \u2018How not to be a colonizer.\u2019 Whatever you do, I want to hear you not speaking.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bark doesn\u2019t just have to be a counter for useless words, either.

A purse is clutched when you walk on an elevator? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! (If they\u2019re going to act scared, you might as well give them a reason to be.)\n\nOf course, this barking will take some practice. They can\u2019t be small dog barks, so people with higher and/or softer voices will probably have to do some training. Which is why, today, I\u2019m announcing the opening the M\u2019Baku School of Wakandan White Silencing. The classes will be free, so no worries about me using GoFundMe monies for bigen and Creatine.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Also, the bark was actually an ape grunt.

Some great moments deserve a sequel, and we\u2019ve therefore done some deep investigative journalism to get the details on our favorite look of Grammy night 2018.\n\nAs previously posted, Eve was our hands-down winner of this year\u2019s awards ceremony, despite not being nominated this year (sorry, Beyonc\u00e9). Thanks to our intrepid, talented and well-connected Gizmodo Media Group family (we\u2019re talking about you, Victor Amos!), we were able to get the scoop on Eve\u2019s incredible Grammys style\u2014and, most important, how to imitate it.\n\nLet\u2019s start with that gorgeous face: Makeup artist Ernesto Casillas has been working with Eve since the promotional tour for Barbershop and counts her among his favorite clients. For her Grammys look, he rose to the occasion while not even knowing what the star would be wearing, as he tells The Glow Up:\n\nFor the look, I knew right away that I wanted to keep it pretty and somewhat classic. We didn\u2019t know exactly what outfit she was going to wear up until right before she went on, so I wanted to keep the colors neutral and paint her in a way that she would feel confident and pretty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe multihyphenate added \u201cred-carpet host\u201d to her title this year, co-hosting the evening\u2019s Grammy Red Carpet Live with Entertainment Tonight\u2019s Nancy O\u2019Dell, Kevin Frazier and Keltie Knight. To make sure the star stayed stellar-looking throughout the day, Casillas had a strategy:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCasillas also wanted to make sure the focus stayed where it belonged while his star was speaking on the red carpet:\n\nEve usually likes to opt for a nude pink lip, but I knew I wanted a midtone lip, since she was wearing a suit and would be interviewing people. I wanted the mouth to also be a focus, but not too dark, either. I lined the lips with a deep berry color and filled in with a lighter, peachier shade. I used Kat Von D\u2019s \u201cLolita\u201d lipstick and some nude gloss over that.\n\nAnd lest we forget that Eve opted to wear not one, but two d\u00e9colletage-baring blazers during the evening, Casillas certainly didn\u2019t, using Gleam Body Bronzing Lotion in shade Deep Gold on her chest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as for that mane of perfectly tousled waves Eve was rocking over her shoulder? You can thank hairstylist Angela Christine, who\u2019s been working with Eve for over seven years and also styles her for The Talk. Christine tells The Glow Up:\n\nShe\u2019s an amazing person to work with, [and] really makes the job easy. Eve loves strong and effortless, so once she chose the suit, she wanted something that felt relaxed and beautiful at the same time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that deciding on Eve\u2019s style was effortless; Christine was ready for a big chop, but the star felt otherwise. \u201cWe actually went back and forth about the hair. ... I wanted to do a shorter, edgy cut, but she was serious about keeping it long,\u201d Christine says.\n\nAnd as for that color? Christine says that she and Eve have been playing with both warm and cool tones lately, and the honey tone was actually done well in advance. The extensions actually came from Christine\u2019s own line, Conscious Curls, in a texture called Strength, which closely resembles natural hair blown out. \u201cThis [allowed] for lots of fullness and volume, which we both loved,\u201d Christine says.\n\nChristine then used a medium-barrel ceramic curling iron to achieve those gorgeous loose waves, strategically curling in opposite directions for a messier look. She then used Ouai Rose Oil and Kenra Texturizing Taffy to create even more separation and texture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristine\u2014who, in addition to working for The Talk, also has a salon in West Hollywood, Calif., and consults for other beauty brands\u2014is releasing a series of affirming children\u2019s books called the Pretty Curls Club.

Hyacinthe is one of the hardest-hustling creatives in New York City, crafting a hybrid career out of her two greatest passions: music and fashion. By day, the stylist and CEO of Immaculate Wardrobe dresses Fortune 500 female power brokers; by night, she\u2019s DJ Soda Pop, spinning hip-hop and house at Manhattan venues like the Museum of Sex\u2014where she launches a weekly residency tonight.\n\nThe Glow Up recently caught up with the busy Bronx-born beauty to discuss her parallel creative careers and her future as a fashion DJ. The product of what she describes as a traditional Haitian-American family, Hyacinthe grew up on a steady diet of hip-hop and haute couture, influenced by three older brothers and a style-obsessed stepsister. Her own obsession with fashion began so early, she recalls cutting out and stashing Vogue spreads under her pillowcase, just so she could wear the outfits in her dreams:\n\nI remember being in school\u2014we had to list our skills, what we were good at. And the only thing I [could] think of was that I can put clothes together nicely. ... And I remember picking up\u2014it was Vibe magazine\u2014and they used to have the fashion editorials, and I saw [celebrity fashion stylist] June Ambrose. And they had this article, and I remember it led with \u201cstyle architect,\u201d and I was just like, \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to do!\u201d She was a major inspiration. ... I just saw her, and I was like, \u201cThis is what I aspire to be.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, it was a mentoring program led by image activist Michaela angela Davis that would be the conduit for bringing Hyacinthe\u2019s aspirations to fruition\u2014and would teach her a powerful lesson in asking for what you want:\n\nIt all starts with Michaela; she was running something called Salon du Shine at her house, where there\u2019d be a group of, like, 10 of us girls [getting] together in her loft in Brooklyn. And we would just talk about stuff, you know. And I remember going up to Michaela, like, \u201cCan you introduce me to June Ambrose?\u201d And she was just like, \u201cI don\u2019t know ... June is super-busy.\u201d I kid you not: A couple of days later, Michaela calls me and she says, \u201cJune is looking for an intern.\u201d... So I went to the interview\u2014June\u2019s two assistants at the time, they tore me to pieces\u2014but I wound up getting the internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile interning for Ambrose, Hyacinthe also worked full time to put herself through the Fashion Merchandising Management program at New York City\u2019s Berkeley College. It was the beginning of a career path that her Haitian parents, unfortunately, didn\u2019t understand:\n\nMy parents\u2014although they were very loving\u2014they didn\u2019t understand the concept of me wanting to be a stylist and me being in a creative field; it was foreign to them. ... They didn\u2019t have the opportunity to dream as we do, and I think because of that, they\u2019re unable to\u2014they\u2019re in a sense blind to that. ... So I wound up having to put myself through college; I worked full time [in retail] and I did this internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorking for Ambrose taught Hyacinthe how the editorials she once obsessed over were created, but it was working in retail that helped her find her niche: helping busy professional women build their wardrobes.\n\nI would work with clients, and they\u2019d be like, \u201cSophia, I love working with you; you style me so well. I wish you could come dress me at home.\u201d And one day I actually got the courage to say, \u201cWell, I can.\u201d ... So this one client took me up on it, and I went to her house and started with her closet. But then she had me speak with her career coach, and that\u2019s when it really clicked: This is on another level. Like, you know, female executives really need this. And I really found the value that I could add.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIdentifying her core clientele and their unique need to possess a high-end wardrobe without having the time to curate or shop for it, Hyacinthe launched her company, Immaculate Wardrobe. The self-described \u201cwardrobe whisperer\u201d currently dresses about 20 clients, all of whom are powerful women who inspire her daily, as she explained:\n\n\n\nI work primarily with female boss bitches. These are women that are working [as] CEOs of companies, and they\u2019re also moms. ... I feel like it\u2019s really important for me to surround myself with these powerful women. And I feel like since they\u2019re at the top of their companies, not only am I empowering them, but also the women that come [into their companies] that\u2019ve just graduated from college ... to see that someone at the top of their career is not only killing it, but also killing it with style.\n\nBut while helping other women fulfill their potential, Hyacinthe also realized an opportunity to further fulfill her own. A longtime avid lover of music, she was often critical of DJs on the New York City nightclub scene. Challenged by an exasperated friend to learn for herself, she accepted his gift of a DJ class at New York\u2019s famed Rock & Soul record store. Instantly, another passion was born, along with an alter ego: DJ Soda Pop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike her styling career, Hyacinthe\u2019s growth as a DJ has been simultaneously organic and self-driven. She initially asked more-established DJs for opening slots and cultivated her own contacts and connections. It\u2019s a path that called into conflict the hip-hop-loving girl from New York\u2019s Bronx borough and the cultured style expert whom elite businesswomen entrust with their wardrobes:\n\n\n\nGrowing up in my family, I grew up listening to Reasonable Doubt, to Onyx, to Nas\u2014like, really hard music. Like, I\u2019m very feminine and girly now, but I grew up liking really hard-core rap. I\u2019ve always known that I\u2019ve had this love and passion for music, but it was, \u201cOK, Sophia, either you can pursue fashion styling or you can be a DJ.\u201d I didn\u2019t think in my mind\u2014I couldn\u2019t fathom the idea of me flourishing in both fields ... [But] to be honest with you, I can\u2019t exist with one without the other. ... I feel like they feed into each other so much, especially the route that I want to go. ... I want to be New York\u2019s new fashion DJ, and there\u2019s not enough of us brown girls up there that are actually doing it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile her dual careers may seem to be a study in contrasts, Hyacinthe approaches both spinning and styling instinctively, using unexpected textural combinations to evoke new feelings. And in the process of embracing her dual passions, her own identity fell into place.\n\nI feel like deejaying has really helped me fully come into my skin. ... Even with race: It\u2019s like before, I thought that I needed to kind of neglect my own identity to be accepted. And I know I\u2019m not the only one that feels that way; as a black woman in the fashion industry, which is predominantly white. I thought that I needed to strip some of my identity\u2014the fact that I listened to hip-hop, the fact that I loved it, the fact that I came from the Bronx\u2014I thought that I almost needed to move away from that in order for me to be seen in society as being this elegant person in fashion ... [but] I feel like once you accept yourself, they have no choice but to accept you for who you are. And I feel like deejaying has really allowed me to accept myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re in the New York City area, you can catch DJ Soda Pop every Thursday night at the Museum of Sex at 233 Fifth Ave. She launches her weekly residency Thursday night with a viewing party for RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race.", "keywords": ["fashion", "wardrobe", "dope", "double", "dj", "inside", "feel", "york", "think", "really", "night", "hyacinthe", "sophia", "career", "women", "dressed", "life"], "polarity": 0.16347579051383396, "subjectivity": 0.5693305335968378},

There were thriving and ideological-diverse cities surrounded by expansive and bucolic countrysides. There was modern technology perfectly weaved in to cultural tradition, a melding that was symbiotic instead of antagonistic. And while I didn\u2019t see this happening during the movie, I\u2019m sure Wakanda has amazing bottomless brunches.\n\nUnfortunately, a present-day attempt to recreate Wakanda would be unrealistic. Mainly because we\u2019re roughly 20,000 years behind Wakandan tech. And mostly because we\u2019re too infected with colonization and its myriad residues and peripheral effects. Also, we\u2019re a little short on Vibranium.\n\nOne thing, however, that we can and definitely should start doing is what M\u2019Baku and his Que Dog Jabari Tribe did when encountering a problematic white dude who was speaking when there was no ask or need or purpose for the thoughts and opinions of problematic white dudes.\n\nBark.\n\nNot a purposeless bark. This isn\u2019t a shih tzu barking through the window at a squirrel. Instead this would be an intentional bark. A targeted bark. An overpowering bark. A drowning bark. A Wakandan bark. A bark meant to communicate \u201cUm, who told you that you can speak? When it is time for your words, we will let you know. And maybe that time will never come. We\u2019ll see. Now, just shut up and stand there. Maybe get on your phone and google \u2018How not to be a colonizer.\u2019 Whatever you do, I want to hear you not speaking.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bark doesn\u2019t just have to be a counter for useless words, either. A wayward white hand reaches for your hair? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! A group of white people huddled on a sidewalk refuse to step aside when you attempt to walk past them? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! A purse is clutched when you walk on an elevator? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! (If they\u2019re going to act scared, you might as well give them a reason to be.)\n\nOf course, this barking will take some practice. They can\u2019t be small dog barks, so people with higher and/or softer voices will probably have to do some training. Which is why, today, I\u2019m announcing the opening the M\u2019Baku School of Wakandan White Silencing. The classes will be free, so no worries about me using GoFundMe monies for bigen and Creatine.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Also, the bark was actually an ape grunt.

Was it awkward, exhilarating, overwhelming, tender, traumatic\u2014or some combination of all of the above?\n\nMine was all of those things. I was a high schooler in suburban Chicago, in the throes of my first\u2014and at that age, what I believed would be my last\u2014love. Even today, I can sincerely say that it was true\u2014if young\u2014love; and in true Romeo and Juliet fashion, I threw my inexperienced self headlong into it ...\n\nAt least, until my mother found out.\n\nTo say that my mother didn\u2019t take the loss of my virginity well would be putting it mildly. While she\u2019d educated me about sexuality and sexual health since I was 6 years old, I discovered my own sexuality earlier than either of us had planned\u2014if you can plan such a thing. I may have been in love, but for my mother and me, that revelation was mutually traumatic. I was mortified and scared; she was angry, disappointed, and\u2014as I\u2019d come to understand years later\u2014terrified by the thought that I might have compromised myself and my future so early in life.\n\nWhile we often prepare our children for the mechanics and risks of sexuality, we often leave them to figure out the workings of love on their own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo there was something instantly recognizable about last Wednesday\u2019s episode of Grown-ish, in which protagonist Zoey Johnson and mom Rainbow (in a guest appearance by her Black-ish mom, Tracee Ellis Ross) found themselves in much the same situation. In a brief but poignant scene, Zoey revealed to her mother that she\u2019d fallen in love\u2014and had sex for the first time. \u201cAre you mad?\u201d she asked. In the pregnant pause that followed (pun intended), I cringed along with her as she awaited her mother\u2019s response:\n\n\u201cNo! I\u2014I just don\u2019t want to think about it ... but did you use protection? ... It was bound to happen at some point,\u201d Rainbow sputtered.\n\n\n\nIt was a refreshing moment\u2014and a departure from the usual conversations that occur around black girls and sexuality, in which we are generally divorced from our own innocence and vulnerability. The truth is, we\u2019re rarely presumed to be in love (or given the space to be), or exercising decision-making based on sexual autonomy and emotional intimacy\u2014let alone smart enough to protect ourselves. Instead, we\u2019re generally cast as over-sexualized and often \u201casking for it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Zoey\u2019s being of college age was likely another key factor in how this scenario played out, even as a fictional mother (and doctor), Rainbow understood that sexuality was a natural part of her daughter\u2019s maturation. She also seemed to understand that that development wasn\u2019t destined to happen on her time. Her primary concerns\u2014aside from her child\u2019s physical safety\u2014were not for her daughter\u2019s \u201cpurity,\u201d but for the larger implications of her making what could be a lifelong commitment at such a young age; in this case, to leave college with a potentially NBA-bound boyfriend.\n\n\u201cZoey, I did not raise you like this,\u201d Rainbow ranted. \u201cYou\u2019re a woman who\u2019s just going to throw it all away for some guy? You worked so hard to get here!\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s where the writers\u2019 room at Grown-ish really got it right this episode. Because instead of focusing on the loss of virginity (which didn\u2019t even merit its own scene), the focus was rightly placed on what it means for a black girl to commit herself to someone\u2014in mind and body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the discussion I wish my mother and I had had all those years ago. I wish she\u2019d trusted that she\u2019d taught me well on how to conduct myself physically, and focused on the emotional implications of my choice. Because while we often prepare our children for the mechanics and risks of sexuality, we often leave them to figure out the workings of love on their own.\n\nAs I\u2019ve since discussed with my mother, rarely does anyone tell young women what it\u2019ll be like when you first fall for someone\u2014and they, in turn, fall for you. Rarely does anyone tell you how overwhelming that will be, and how you\u2019ll do anything to hold on to that feeling. Beyond discussing sexual health\u2014and, now, rape culture\u2014rarely are we preparing our daughters to trust themselves emotionally, and to take their own agency sexually.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m personally grateful that a show like Grown-ish exists for this generation. Because as a member of several older generations of folks who often seem to lack the emotional intelligence to have productive, mutually respectful relationships, I think that maybe these are the conversations we need to be having.", "keywords": ["rarely", "rainbow", "daughters", "leave", "shed", "love", "emotional", "sexuality", "right", "mothers", "grownish", "weeks", "mother", "sexual", "talk"], "polarity": 0.15486830357142856, "subjectivity": 0.5726875},

The winner of the pageant will now reign as the Queen of Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea\u2019s carnival, and her responsibilities include representing the Afro-Bloco in and outside Brazil, as well as dancing in carnival during the group\u2019s parade.\n\n\u201cThe Goddess of Ebony contest is a validation of representation,\u201d Neal, 35, told a Brazilian newspaper. \u201cIt is very much needed here, [and] all over the world. To me, it says, \u2018I am here, I am valid, I exist, I have a proud history, I have beautiful cultural narratives and I am not alone.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeal traveled back to Salvador to prepare and compete, thanks to a fundraising campaign she started once she learned that Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea had accepted her application for the pageant. On the day she arrived, she went straight from the airport to her first practice with the other contestants, who ranged in age from 18 to their 40s. All but four came from Salvador.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was dropping a kitten in a bunny cage,\u201d said Neal, who is a director, filmmaker, photographer and writer. \u201cThe other contestants didn\u2019t quite know what to make of me. They didn\u2019t know if I was a novelty or serious competitor. I was fatigued, sweating, and my eyes were bloodshot from all the travel.\u201d\n\nShe made waves in Salvador and was featured on the front page of the local newspaper. The local population supported her participation in the pageant, which has traditionally been seen as a way to promote black women from local communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think that the overall impact has been positive,\u201d said Adrian Erik McCray, a longtime African-American expat in Salvador. \u201cThe fact that an African American\u2014\u2018an elite,\u2019 in the eyes of Brazil\u2014chose to participate in something that revives the resistance spirit of Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea is something positive.\u201d\n\nOnce settled in Salvador, Neal scrambled desperately to find someone who could create the two required dresses\u2014one representing Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea and another representing a deity. She then learned a special dance that\u2014more so than beauty\u2014defines the Ebony Goddess.\n\nNeal found a savior in 27-year-old Cec\u00edlia Cadile, an entrepreneur who placed third in last year\u2019s Beleza Negra. Cadile\u2019s involvement in the pageant dates back to when she was a teenager, when her sister competed in the pageant. In the two weeks before the pageant, Cadile worked as Neal\u2019s coach, teaching her the special Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea dance and helping to prepare her two dresses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a already precious stone, and she only needed someone to help bring out the shine in her,\u201d Cadile said.\n\nContestants pose with last year\u2019s Deusa de \u00c9bano, Gisele Santos Soares.

Neal had already developed an intimate relationship with Afro-Brazilian culture and music through her participation in a Brazilian drumming group in the U.S., but she did not grow up with the rhythms and dances of Candombl\u00e9, a handicap she overcame within two weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese women have been doing this all of their lives as part of their experience in Candomble,\u201d Neal said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t born in Candombl\u00e9.\u201d\n\nWhen the moment came for her to perform her dance, Neal put her heart, soul and even stomach into it:\n\nRight before I was about to go on, we were standing in a narrow, one-window hallway backstage, and it was really uncomfortable. I was hot, I was breathless, I was dizzy, I needed to sit down, I needed to stand up. I needed to eat something, I needed to throw up ... all these contradictions! I perform and I\u2019m fine. As soon as I get offstage, I\u2019m sick again. I can\u2019t breathe, I\u2019m hot, I\u2019m sleepy, I\u2019m awake ... then I\u2019m fine. I go to where I can see the rest of the contestants, and as they come offstage to the holding area, they\u2019re all going through the same or similar feelings as I am: hot, breathless, crying, shaking.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeal didn\u2019t win the contest. The new Deusa de Ebano is J\u00e9ssica Almeida Nascimento dos Santos, 19, who hails from the Cabula neighborhood in Salvador.\n\n\u201cI felt like I did what I came to do and was satisfied,\u201d Neal said. \u201cI didn\u2019t win, obviously, but I feel emotionally amazing.\u201d", "keywords": ["woman", "afrobrazilian", "contestants", "pageant", "im", "africanamerican", "queen", "competed", "goddess", "aiy\u00ea", "salvador", "il\u00ea", "beauty", "ebony", "neal", "needed", "women"], "polarity": 0.10597478544846965, "subjectivity": 0.4534500075947444},

Be ready. Your Facebook cousins ended 2017 in grand style with an argument about rings, which they will surely resurrect. An alleged Kay Jewelers ad for a $24.99 engagement ring had married and single women debating if wanting a more expensive ring made them gold diggers or not.\n\nSo before they reprise their battle royal, I want to talk about why we all should let women get engaged without telling them to lower their demands\u2014for rings or anything else.\n\n\n\nThe internet refers to women as a \u201cpick me\u201d when they seem to bend over backward to accommodate potential mates. Women with obsequious opinions on relationships aren\u2019t necessarily jockeying for a man to notice them. Sure, they might be annoying at times, but I keep my complexion clear by remembering there is someone for everyone. I simply am not here for telling other women how low they must go to find love. As bad as a \u201cpick me\u201d can look, it has nothing on a woman boasting about how cheaply she got picked for.\n\nI find it tacky when married women tell single women how their love didn\u2019t cost a thing and expect their unmarried counterparts to follow suit. Sis, I admire your struggle love, really, I do. But that doesn\u2019t have to be every woman\u2019s narrative.\n\nTheir stories try to convey that the quality of the ring doesn\u2019t determine the quality of the relationship. I applaud that. Collectively, however, the overwhelming message turns into: \u201cHe picked me for less, and you should ask for less, too.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it\u2019s OK if some women want a ring that costs more than a Popeyes chicken bucket. But single women who dare express this truth hear two ugly lies about themselves:\n\n1. \u201cWomen are more concerned about the engagement ring than the marriage.\u201d\n\nHow important is a ring, anyway?\n\nWe aren\u2019t all going to agree on the answer to that question. And you know what? That\u2019s perfectly fine. You can point out that the popularity of the diamond engagement ring is the result of marketing\u2014and you would be right. If you start to unravel many traditions behind weddings, they are often rooted in misogyny or money, not romance. It is a saving grace that wedding rituals evolved over time to signify something beautiful. We fall in love with the symbolism and create our own reasons as to why it matters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA ring is merely one symbol in a social rite full of symbols: changing one\u2019s name, walking down the aisle, jumping the broom, breaking the glass. Neither the ceremony nor the traditions surrounding weddings hold much import in the actual marriage.\n\nThis is why I do not understand the vitriol and \u201cgold digger\u201d labels reserved for women who value the ring as a token of affection. It is asinine to castigate other women for adhering to one expendable nuptial custom when you probably have your own.\n\nMost women aren\u2019t more concerned about engagement rings than about their (impending or imagined) marriages. Arguments that women who give thought to their rings are \u201cfocusing on the wrong thing\u201d present a false binary. You can ask for the ring you prefer and put a lot of care into your marital relationship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cWomen should be so happy to receive a proposal; they should accept anything.\u201d\n\nFirst of all, I see a proposal as the introduction to a lifetime of partnership and work, not an honorific. Marriage is not a validation that women should be thankful to receive. But I saw one message from a woman scolding others: \u201cSomebody actually wanted you! Sit down! Be humble!\u201d\n\nI have a serious problem with people telling black women that they should be grateful anyone proposes to them at all. Black women are often cast as undesirable in the American imagination. It works a raw nerve to hear us tell one another that we are unworthy of material or emotional good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInasmuch as we should all express gratitude for finding love in this world, it\u2019s another thing entirely to consider a proposal as a charity. \u201cBeggars can\u2019t be choosers\u201d doesn\u2019t apply here.\n\nFurthermore, a ring is a gift you\u2019re expected to wear day in and day out. What is so reprehensible about trying to find a ring a woman likes? Can we even apply the rule that \u201cit\u2019s the thought that counts\u201d if the gift reflects thoughtlessness? Any token offered without the recipient in mind is a bribe for a compliment.\n\nMost women are not arguing that a man they truly love should go bankrupt on a ring. Women want to feel consideration, and they want a ring they don\u2019t hate. If the issue is affordability, and a woman inflexibly demands something her beau can\u2019t afford, that couple has bigger fish to fry than carats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut were we really arguing over $25 rings ... or something else?\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t believe a conversation about \u201cungrateful\u201d women and cheap engagement rings is actually about rings at all. The unspoken contention is that (black) women are not allowed to have a floor, a preference, a bare minimum, a shred of a standard in their own love story. We are expected not to find someone who would willingly be what we desire and require, but to ask for little and be overjoyed at just enough. And apparently, \u201ctoo much\u201d is a ring over $25.\n\nThis Valentine\u2019s Day, don\u2019t be that married person lecturing singles about how your beau had nothing to offer but his undying love and twin bed. I know you gladly accepted an engagement ring fished out of a Cracker Jack box. Yes, we know your 20-year marriage is going strong, even though it didn\u2019t start out with the Rock of Gibraltar on your finger. Your examples show us that true love can thrive with less.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut love is just as beautiful when it finds us worthy of what we ask for, even if it\u2019s more.", "keywords": ["pick", "rings", "picked", "ask", "day", "love", "thing", "engagement", "worse", "woman", "telling", "women", "bragging", "ring"], "polarity": 0.1393052079933268, "subjectivity": 0.5276680690047028},

Now in his 10th year as head of his own label, the most successful graduate of the Project Runway franchise has built his success on dressing women of all colors, shapes and sizes and fully diversifying his runway presentations into inspirational, aspirational and attainable symbols of beauty and style.\n\nThough Siriano himself is as petite as they come, he knows that the fashion struggle is real for people whose proportions, personalities or orientations are not the \u201cnorm\u201d on the retail floor or red carpet. Maybe that\u2019s why he\u2019s been so nimble at dressing die-hard fans like EGOT Whoopi Goldberg, who sat front-row at his show Saturday, along with rap \u201cit\u201d girl Cardi B, dressed head to toe in a money-green suit with a white mink stole tossed over her shoulder for good measure.

Everything is about to change\u2014or so it seems\u2014as designers present fashion shows featuring clothes generally intended to break the rules. But one thing rarely, if ever, seems to change, and that\u2019s the absence of black designers occupying top spots in the fashion industry.\n\nFreelance designer and journalist Kibwe Chase-Marshall recently published an op-ed in Business of Fashion\u2014one of the most respected media outlets for fashion-industry reporting\u2014titled, \u201cWhy Aren\u2019t There More Black Designers?\u201d It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve asked myself nearly every time I\u2019ve gone into work over my 30-year career in fashion. Why?\n\nAll too often, I\u2019m the only person of color on set doing any job. The rare exception is on the catwalk, where the sheer number of people required to produce a fashion show calls for hiring more than one black person, simply by default. But when the final bow is taken, it is almost never a black designer who has the chance to receive either kudos or a career-ending critique from the press.\n\nChase-Marshall\u2014who worked in high-level but never top-tier jobs, such as vice president or head designer, for firms like Michael Kors, Isaac Mizrahi and Oscar de la Renta\u2014found himself repeatedly slamming up against a glass ceiling. And now he\u2019s breaking that glass ceiling by breaking the silence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Jan. 3, an action-oriented social media campaign, #BreakSilenceBreakCeilings, went live. The campaign was conceived by Chase-Marshall and aimed at breaking the unwritten and unspoken rule of discriminatory hiring practices in fashion, an industry that Chase-Marshall says does not have a \u201cdiversity problem\u201d but, rather, a \u201cblack-people problem.\u201d\n\nHimself a talented technical draftsman, stylist and cutter, Chase-Marshall is not content to simply illustrate the talent of black designers as a solution to the problem. In February, I was on a steering committee for the Black Designers Exhibition and Symposium at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, which shed light on the fierce beauty of too-little-seen talent and started the conversation as to why\u2014but did not offer us a plan to advance the battle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChase-Marshall has tailored a solution to fit the problem, noting in his op-ed, \u201cFed up with watching this most blatant form of discrimination thrive, while the broader industry capitalizes on Black celebrity associations and the recent uptick in Black casting, I decided to do something.\u201d\n\nChase-Marshall, who stopped working full time in design studios in 2010 after 13 years, now makes a living as a freelance designer and writer for publications like Elle. He has devised a plan of action for the Council of Fashion Designers of America and Vogue, which collaborate on the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund, the most powerful entity in the American\u2014if not global\u2014luxury-garment industry, which has promoted some of the most successful black designers in recent memory, such as Tracy Reese and Cushnie and Ochs.\n\nChase-Marshall would like to see CFDA/Vogue adopt a program with greater oversight of its design-industry members, such as offering immersive training for hiring managers in elimination of bias, along with CFDA/Vogue\u2019s annual disclosure and endorsement of participating brands, along with annual statistics regarding the racial composition of their design teams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s what the industry can do, but to consumers who want to take a stand against inequality and appropriation, Chase-Marshall posted:\n\nLet\u2019s do something: If you agree that it\u2019s time for the community of fashion design professionals to be taken to task regarding employment/advancement discrimination against qualified black candidates, along with liking this post, comment #breaksilencebreakceilings and tag @CFDA, @Voguemagazine, @Bof, @nytimes, and @wwd below. In addition, forward this post to 5 friends (or more) that you feel care to affect overdue change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlackness, until very recently, was seen as an unmarketable quality,\u201d says Chase-Marshall, who hails from Trinidad, was raised in Washington, D.C., and was a classmate of the Clinton and Gore children. But despite having the clubby connections to wealth and power that headhunters prize for their potential to move the needle when it comes to selling expensive designer clothing, he was discounted, simply because of the color of his skin.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if someone is racist,\u201d Chase-Marshall says. \u201cI care if people use discriminatory hiring practices.\u201d His is neither a call for affirmative action nor a call for quotas\u2014which can undercut recognition of real talent\u2014but, rather, a call for education transparency and accountability that can create lasting change within the fashion industry.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m proud of Chase-Marshall for pushing us beyond merely saying that we have the right to more than just exist and be seen in the fashion industry. It\u2019s our responsibility to demand, not only of fashion but also of our trendsetting selves, that our spending be reflected in the identities of the images marketed to us, as well as that our dollars come back into our communities through the black talent being paid and promoted according to their true worth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInspired by Muhammad Ali and Colin Kaepernick, Chase-Marshall, who currently engages in every type of freelance work, from designing pull-up diapers to diamond rings, wants to be the kind of person who \u201cprioritizes their integrity over their paycheck.\u201d He broke his silence \u201cbecause you can\u2019t continue to play a losing game.\u201d Now it\u2019s time for the powerful consumers black women are to suit up and make the fashion industry play ball.", "keywords": ["hiring", "missing", "black", "action", "designers", "chasemarshall", "simply", "industry", "designer", "problem", "fashion", "talent"], "polarity": 0.12858133650387174, "subjectivity": 0.4944134503993659},

What you want it to say.\u2019 That\u2019s what I had to do.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the pain of being called \u201cintimidating\u201d:\n\n\u201cThe worst thing someone can say about me in a personal sense, because I\u2019ve heard other media outlets say this about me, is that I\u2019m intimidating. Sometimes it hurts more than someone calling me a bitch or cunt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know that as soon as they utter that word, I think about all of the times where I have been pressured, subconsciously or not, implicitly or explicitly, to shrink\u2014or be completely shut off from romantic love for the rest of my life.\n\n\u201cIt makes me feel so large and like there\u2019s no room for anyone else. \u2026 It makes me feel like they\u2019re saying, \u2018Well, there\u2019s no room for me in your life.\u2019 How can I even fit, metaphorically or figuratively, in your life, in this conversation? It\u2019s like a rejection, but it\u2019s also like, \u2018Stay the way you are.\u2019 And it\u2019s like, but if you\u2019re telling me, and so many other people are telling me this, then where does that leave me?\u201d\n\nOn receiving her first vibrator\u2014from her mother:\n\n\u201cWhen I tell you that my body was on fire\u2014I had all of this kinetic energy and my heart just got broken. I didn\u2019t know what happened. I just wanted to be touched and I wasn\u2019t getting it anywhere. There were moments when I was just waking up in the middle of the night just like, it felt crazy. And my mother was kind enough to be like, \u2018I\u2019m going to help you because, what else can I do?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe knew that I was going through it. And it\u2019s a very taboo subject in Christian circles, but it helped me because it helped me to take control of my sexuality. And also it helped me to avoid situations that were not going to be healthy for me.\n\n\u201cNow that I\u2019m an adult, my mother and I have talks about men and everything like that more vividly and more explicitly. It was powerful for me because it let me know that she cared. It let me know that I could talk to her about pretty much anything. When I had my labioplasty, she was there; when my stepfather passed, she was there. There [were] so many moments when she was there.\n\n\u201cI think people have to recognize that black mothers, they aren\u2019t all the same. But in terms of my black mother, she was trying to do stuff [that] when I was younger might seem like, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s trying to make you assimilate to something.\u2019 But she just knows how the world is, and how cruel the world is to black girls.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn being progressive and Christian:\n\n\u201cI think what is important for people of color who identify as Christian to do is to divorce themselves from a white male lens. A lot of times, I\u2019ll meet Christian people and their politics aren\u2019t there. And then I\u2019ll meet people who I\u2019m really great with politically, and they\u2019re agnostic or atheist, and I\u2019m like, well. ... I think the thing for me is it takes deeper investigation on my part to say, \u2018How do I think about Christianity in a liberating sense away from a white male lens?\u2019 And that may be more self-study and less relying on preachers to tell me everything.\u201d\n\nOn how her faith influences her ambition:\n\n\u201cI have to remind myself that if it\u2019s true that what it says\u2014that God knew before I was even born; that he stitched every part of me before I was even conceived of\u2014then why am I going to deny myself? When I think of the professional endeavors ... I think back [to] getting published in the New Yorker at 23 years old. Where did I have the nerve to think [I could do] that?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I used to teach, people, they would say, \u2018Well, how did you know you were ready? Did you say, \u201cOh, I\u2019m going to write 20 articles before I pitch there?\u201d\u2019 And I just said, \u2018I don\u2019t ask for permission in anything that I do in this world, because no one is going to just give it to me. What I can do is come to you with this opportunity that I want. Say, these are the reasons why I can do it.\u2019 And you take from that what you will.\u201d\n\nOn impostor syndrome and the audacity of being on the cover of your own book:\n\n\u201cThere was belief, but don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014when those pieces were, in fact, published, I had very terrible impostor syndrome. I\u2019m talking about looking at my byline, tracing each letter of my name with my eyes and still not believing that I wrote that. ... There were many times with this book ...with the anticipation of it all, [thinking,] \u2018How dare I think that I can write what I just wrote? Where did that type of courage come from?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEven now, when I look at the cover of my book, I think, \u2018How dare I look so proud of my own book? How dare I even be on it?\u2019 But I think what I have to emphasize is that I\u2019ve always been afraid. I\u2019ve always been a worryful person; I just don\u2019t let it overtake the courage.\u201d\n\nOn living in an unapologetically black space:\n\n\u201cI think Harlem is the only place where I\u2019m not so hyperconscious about white people. I know that if I go to the nearest store and I got a scarf on my head, no one\u2019s going to treat me any differently. I will still be acknowledged. ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHarlem is different for me, because it\u2019s the only place where I\u2019m not second-guessing any type of mode of behavior that I have. Despite gentrification, I\u2019m not worried about the white person next to me. I know I\u2019m going to be acknowledged regardless of what I have on my head, what it is that I\u2019m wearing. Nobody\u2019s going to deny me proper treatment.\u201d\n\nOn growing into, and accepting, a desire to be beautiful:\n\n\u201cI think my conception of beauty happened [in] two different ways: One was when I saw Zadie Smith in person, and I was like, she looks exactly as she does in the pictures. A part of me was like, \u2018Oh my God. I\u2019m jealous! She\u2019s stunning!\u2019 And then when I got on the cover of my book, I became much more hyperaware of how I looked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was like, it wasn\u2019t just enough for me to be a great writer, which is what I strive to be all the time. But I wanted people to say that \u2018she\u2019s beautiful\u2019 as well, because that\u2019s the culture we live in. And also because I\u2019ve denied myself acknowledgment of my beauty.\n\n\u201cI feel empowered putting on a bold lipstick. I feel empowered when I try on a new eye shadow in a color that I never thought that I would really like, to be able to indulge in that way, because I never really did that for myself. And if someone acknowledges that attention that I spend on myself, then so be it. It makes me feel good!\n\n\u201cAnd I want to be able to say that with confidence and not think that is, you know, that\u2019s going to be detrimental to my art. Because this is such a personal book, that\u2019s why I\u2019m like\u2014I think that I\u2019m noticing the relationship. It definitely kicked into heavy gear when I was on the cover of my own book.

Blige\u2019s glow up this awards season; in fact, we\u2019re not sure we\u2019ve stanned this hard for her since What\u2019s the 411? The singer and actress has been nominated for Golden Globe, Critics Choice and Screen Actors Guild awards, and now a history-making two Oscar nods for both her performance and original song in Dee Rees\u2019 Mudbound. And she has stunned us on every single red carpet.\n\nBut those stunning looks have a secret weapon in a longtime member of Blige\u2019s team: celebrity makeup artist D\u2019Andre Michael. Knowing how much we wanted the 411 on Blige\u2019s super-fly SAG Awards look, Michael let The Glow Up in on a surprisingly low-priced secret: He exclusively used products from Black Opal.\n\nYes, THAT Black Opal (its Instagram is kind of poppin\u2019, by the way). In Michael\u2019s words:\n\nI\u2019ve been working with Mary J. Blige for years, and I love trying new looks on her. I wanted to create a showstopping look using Black Opal for her first-time appearance at the SAG Awards. Once I saw her gown, I knew I wanted to transform her into an elegant smoked goddess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was smokin\u2019 indeed, styled by fashion fave Law Roach in a one-shouldered black-and-white gown with a dramatic wing motif by designer Jean-Louis Sabaji.\n\nMichael, who\u2019s been on Blige\u2019s team for over a decade, complemented her dress and sleek modern hairstyle with a perfect smoky eye atop glowing skin, using Black Opal all the way. He shared with The Glow Up why, after years of working with the superstar, this awards season is such a special one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up: As a longtime member of Mary J. Blige\u2019s team, what\u2019s it like to work with her during this groundbreaking phase of her career?\n\nD\u2019Andre Michael: Having been with Mary J. Blige now for 11 years, we are more like family. I am so proud and honored to be a part of this moment with her. I\u2019m happy and overjoyed with her continued success, but this is like the stepping-stone to something I know she has been passionate [about]. It\u2019s amazing to see the acknowledgment and praise she is receiving for her work as an actress. I\u2019m like a proud brother.\n\nTGU: Mary\u2019s looks have been phenomenal at every event. How are you able to keep her looks so fresh?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDM: I have been with her every step of the way: Every award show, every red carpet, press junket, television show, etc. It\u2019s always been my thing to make her look good every time.\n\nMaybe because she\u2019s on a different platform now, a broader audience is taking note, but nothing has changed much with what we do. It\u2019s being there as a support for her in all that she\u2019s going through personally, making sure her spirits are up and she feels good about herself and comfortable with how she looks, what she\u2019s wearing, etc. So I think what shines through mostly is her \u201chappy\u201d\u2014and when you feel good internally, it shows externally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: You used exclusively Black Opal for Mary\u2019s SAG Awards look. Tell us why we should be checking for drugstore brands, and why Black Opal works so well for our tones?\n\nDM: I have never been one to follow trends or fads, mainly because trends come and go, and fads fade away. However, staying true to myself as an artist and finding things that work for me to use on my clients is most important. That\u2019s above any brand\u2014whether it is department store, drugstore or specialty store.\n\nI have learned just because something has a name brand on it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s suitable for what I need to use it for. Therefore, it is all about the quality of a product, and sometimes the most expensive product isn\u2019t necessarily the best. A lot of my favorite go-to products are drugstore brands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy friend Sam Fine worked with Black Opal years ago and helped them with their colors and palettes. Even then, I realized It was a brand that I could trust, because he\u2019s an amazing artist that I respect and call a friend. So if Sam trusts them, I know I can.\n\nDM: Black Opal has always been a staple for having a great color range for women of color; from the fairest of women to the darkest, you could trust you are in good hands with the Black Opal brand, and the formula is great. It gives great coverage that you could work with, whether you need a light coverage to a complete coverage. The Black Opal True Color Skin Perfecting Stick Foundation is amazing! It is great to see they are still around and providing women of color and us professionals with great colors and a great formula.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: At 47, Mary looks incredible. Can you talk about how makeup differs for women in her age group?\n\nDM: The only difference is probably the fads and trends you may want to stay away from with a more mature woman. In terms of looks, you definitely want to use less powder and more products that enhance a dewier look.\n\nFor eyes, most to all women can carry a smoky eye. Many think \u201csmoky eye,\u201d and they think black or dark. But you can smoke your eyes with almost any color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn terms of skin, I like to do my concealer, then apply my foundation, next set with a powder, and maybe spritz your face with a mister or the Evian mist spray to infuse the powder and foundation. Next, let it air-dry to take away the powdered look so you have more of a dewy skin appearance.\n\nIlluminators work as well, but know that sometimes these can come across drab and chalky looking if you use the wrong color. For women of color, I recommend an illuminator in the flesh-tone range (bronzy or mauve, etc.), and stay away from pearl color or yellows or orange-based colors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, even after all that great advice, we couldn\u2019t let Michael go without getting his step-by-step for creating Blige\u2019s SAG look, and all the products he used. How else are we going to plan for our next shopping trip?\n\nFor the Face\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the Eyes\n\nTo sculpt and define Blige\u2019s eyes, Michael used the Black Opal Aurora Eyeshadow Palette. First, he used the Brazen Copper shade on her entire eyelid. Next, he added Brazen Bronze on her crease, adding the Bordeaux Beige shade along the brow bone as a highlight.\n\n\n\nMichael then finished the eye look with Black Opal Color Splurge Automatic Eye Lining Pencil in Licorice, adding it along the lash line and inner lid and smudging to create a smoky look. Note: This eye pencil is formulated with aloe vera and chamomile extracts that help to soothe the delicate eye area as you define it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Lasting Lip\n\nFor the finishing touches to Blige\u2019s look, Michael used Black Opal Lip Color Splurge Stick Lip in Purr, a soft, pale-pink color enriched with emollient butters and vitamins C&E. This lipstick provides a bright, pigment-rich color that provides a smooth, creamy, nondrying finish.\n\nNo word yet on what Blige\u2019s look will be for the 90th Academy Awards on March 4. But even after Michael works his magic, we know the finishing touch will really be Mary J. Blige\u2019s happiness. The Glow Up gang will be watching on our live Facebook group thread and rooting for her\u2014and everybody black!", "keywords": ["mary", "sag", "black", "limit", "bliges", "look", "looks", "love", "price", "js", "color", "opal", "michael", "great", "awards", "eye"], "polarity": 0.24930036777381906, "subjectivity": 0.5446655237584439},

They\u2019re so out of the box, in fact, that they\u2019ve completed a full revolution around the sun and they\u2019re back in the same fucking box. A box that someone needs to staple shut and drop-kick into a puddle.\n\nA few hundred words into the piece, they attempt to explain their rationale with an example of how it would work\u2014a hypothetical featuring recently laid-off West Virginians with dog-walking side hustles so thriving they need to hit up Craigslist ... but for undocumented immigrants for help. If there were a Pulitzer for \u201cWriting While Aggressively White,\u201d this passage would definitely be a nominee:\n\nImagine a woman named Mary Turner, who lives in Wheeling, West Virginia. She was recently laid off from a chicken-processing plant and makes ends meet by walking and taking care of her neighbors\u2019 pets. Mary could expand her little business by hiring some workers, but no one in the area would accept a wage she can afford. Mary goes online\u2014to a new kind of international gig economy website, a Fiverr for immigrants\u2014and applies to sponsor a migrant. She enters information about what she needs: someone with rudimentary English skills, no criminal record and an affection for animals. She offers a room in her basement, meals and $5 an hour. (Sponsors under this program would be exempt from paying minimum wage.) The website offers Mary some matches\u2014people living in foreign countries who would like to spend some time in the United States and earn some money. After some back and forth, Mary interviews a woman named Sofia who lives in Paraguay. Sofia, who grew up in a village, has endured hardships that few Americans can imagine. She is eager to earn some money so that she could move to her nation\u2019s capital city and get some vocational training. A few weeks later, Sofia arrives in Wheeling, after taking a one-week training course on American ways. If things don\u2019t work out, the agency that runs the website will find a new match for Sofia, and Mary will find someone new as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, I read the entire piece so you don\u2019t have to. Below are the 10 worst (and whitest) things about this idea.\n\n1. It\u2019s slavery.\n\n2. No, seriously. Its slavery.\n\n3. It\u2019s not even slavery-adjacent.\n\n4. Or \u201cslavery-flavored\u201d\u2014which is what I call black licorice.\n\n5. Nah, this is fucking slavery.\n\n6. I mean, it includes the line, \u201cSponsors under this program would be exempt from paying minimum wage.\u201d So you could, conceivably, pay a migrant in bite-sized Snickers if you chose to. Which would be delicious. But it would be delicious slavery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. \u201cWait,\u201d I hear you asking, \u201care you saying that Politico published a piece in two thousand fucking eighteen arguing for fucking slavery?\u201d\n\n8. Yes. I am saying exactly that.\n\n9. \u201cWhy would they do such a thing? Who approved this? Who commissioned it? Who are their editors?

The hallmarks of her collection are striking silhouettes with the ease of American sportswear, blazing with her hand-drawn prints or undulating hand-sewn textures based on the ancient history of African civilizations. If you\u2019re looking for a showstopper\u2014you\u2019ve found it here.\n\nThe Glow Up: What\u2019s your idea of glamour for holiday dressing?\n\nMimi Plange: Holiday glamour is about having fun with your personal style\u2014it\u2019s a celebration! It\u2019s about your interpretation of bold color, festive jewel tones and metallics. It\u2019s about your shine without compromising comfort; at the end of the day, it\u2019s about relaxing and enjoying family and friends.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: What makes a woman look sexy?\n\nMP: Only confidence can make you look sexy. Never clothes.\n\nTGU: Who\u2019s your muse?\n\nMP: When I design, I imagine a woman who has a strong sense of self; someone who isn\u2019t interested in labels or monograms. A cultured woman who loves art and exquisite details. She doesn\u2019t want to be like anyone else. She is a leader\u2014a disruptive woman, who understands that her wardrobe is a reflection of her and not the collective society. This is my muse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: What\u2019s a daring item every woman should add to her wardrobe for evening?\n\nMP: Ostrich feathers are magnificent in pastels and a staple in black. It\u2019s a soft, romantic and bold item at the same time. I love the way the light and airy feathers move on their own as you walk. It\u2019s basically sparkles without actual sparkles. I also love neon accents for accessories and shoes.\n\nTGU: What does 2018 have in store for Mimi Plange?\n\nMP: In 2018 we will launch our ready-to-wear collection online and make it available for our customers.

Some great moments deserve a sequel, and we\u2019ve therefore done some deep investigative journalism to get the details on our favorite look of Grammy night 2018.\n\nAs previously posted, Eve was our hands-down winner of this year\u2019s awards ceremony, despite not being nominated this year (sorry, Beyonc\u00e9). Thanks to our intrepid, talented and well-connected Gizmodo Media Group family (we\u2019re talking about you, Victor Amos!), we were able to get the scoop on Eve\u2019s incredible Grammys style\u2014and, most important, how to imitate it.\n\nLet\u2019s start with that gorgeous face: Makeup artist Ernesto Casillas has been working with Eve since the promotional tour for Barbershop and counts her among his favorite clients. For her Grammys look, he rose to the occasion while not even knowing what the star would be wearing, as he tells The Glow Up:\n\nFor the look, I knew right away that I wanted to keep it pretty and somewhat classic. We didn\u2019t know exactly what outfit she was going to wear up until right before she went on, so I wanted to keep the colors neutral and paint her in a way that she would feel confident and pretty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe multihyphenate added \u201cred-carpet host\u201d to her title this year, co-hosting the evening\u2019s Grammy Red Carpet Live with Entertainment Tonight\u2019s Nancy O\u2019Dell, Kevin Frazier and Keltie Knight. To make sure the star stayed stellar-looking throughout the day, Casillas had a strategy:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCasillas also wanted to make sure the focus stayed where it belonged while his star was speaking on the red carpet:\n\nEve usually likes to opt for a nude pink lip, but I knew I wanted a midtone lip, since she was wearing a suit and would be interviewing people. I wanted the mouth to also be a focus, but not too dark, either. I lined the lips with a deep berry color and filled in with a lighter, peachier shade. I used Kat Von D\u2019s \u201cLolita\u201d lipstick and some nude gloss over that.\n\nAnd lest we forget that Eve opted to wear not one, but two d\u00e9colletage-baring blazers during the evening, Casillas certainly didn\u2019t, using Gleam Body Bronzing Lotion in shade Deep Gold on her chest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as for that mane of perfectly tousled waves Eve was rocking over her shoulder? You can thank hairstylist Angela Christine, who\u2019s been working with Eve for over seven years and also styles her for The Talk. Christine tells The Glow Up:\n\nShe\u2019s an amazing person to work with, [and] really makes the job easy. Eve loves strong and effortless, so once she chose the suit, she wanted something that felt relaxed and beautiful at the same time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that deciding on Eve\u2019s style was effortless; Christine was ready for a big chop, but the star felt otherwise. \u201cWe actually went back and forth about the hair. ... I wanted to do a shorter, edgy cut, but she was serious about keeping it long,\u201d Christine says.\n\nAnd as for that color? Christine says that she and Eve have been playing with both warm and cool tones lately, and the honey tone was actually done well in advance. The extensions actually came from Christine\u2019s own line, Conscious Curls, in a texture called Strength, which closely resembles natural hair blown out. \u201cThis [allowed] for lots of fullness and volume, which we both loved,\u201d Christine says.\n\nChristine then used a medium-barrel ceramic curling iron to achieve those gorgeous loose waves, strategically curling in opposite directions for a messier look. She then used Ouai Rose Oil and Kenra Texturizing Taffy to create even more separation and texture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristine\u2014who, in addition to working for The Talk, also has a salon in West Hollywood, Calif., and consults for other beauty brands\u2014is releasing a series of affirming children\u2019s books called the Pretty Curls Club.

Said employee allegedly told her that the move was a directive from corporate.\n\nAllred said that the woman returned to the Walmart a second time and noticed a security camera overhead. NBC 4 reports:\n\nThe woman said she was buying a comb that cost 48 cents, and was wondering why that item was locked up while other non-African-American products that were more expensive were not kept behind a glass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalmart released a response but might want to tread lightly because on the face of it, it looks like this woman may have a legitimate claim of discrimination.\n\nAs Allred said, \u201cIf it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck ... \u201d\n\n\u201cWe serve more than 140 million customers weekly, crossing all demographics, and are focused on meeting their needs while providing the best shopping experience at each store,\u201d a Walmart spokesperson said.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sensitive to this situation and also understand, like other retailers, that some products such as electronics, automotive, cosmetics and other personal care products are subject to additional security,\u201d the spokesperson continued. \u201cThose determinations are made on a store-by-store basis using data supporting the need for the heightened measures.

The multidimensional author of A Beautiful Work in Progress has been making her way around the internet\u2014and on the pavement.\n\nRecently, she was featured in a J.C. Penney campaign with yogi Jessamyn Stanley as well as in a now-viral video with REI, where she reads an ugly email from an anonymous troll who accuses her of not being a runner because she\u2019s overweight. As director of equity and inclusion at Rabun Gap Nacoochee School, the Mirnavator\u2014a pseudonym to almost 30,000 Instagram followers\u2014wears many hats: Spanish instructor, cross-country coach and even, utilizing her Juilliard background, a chorus director; that is, when she\u2019s not beating down the trails or doing a Tough Mudder.\n\n\n\nFor those unfamiliar with her story, Valerio has consistently defied the stereotypes of what an ultrarunner looks like, while being featured by the Wall Street Journal, Runner\u2019s World, NBC Nightly News and CNN.\n\nMany have questioned if she can truly be both \u201cfat and fit\u201d while tackling courses like the Javelina Jundred and the TransRockies Run\u2014a whopping 62.13 and 120 miles, respectively. As she recounts in her book, her passion for fitness dates to her youth; but it was ultimately a health scare that gave her the jump start back into running.\n\n\u201cI was driving through the middle of Pennsylvania when I started getting chest pains, and thought I was having a heart attack,\u201d Valerio told HuffPost in October.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThankfully, it was a false alarm, but she followed up with a cardiologist who advised her to change her lifestyle or else she would die, leaving behind her son. During this period of her life, she was working around the clock, under high stress, with no relief, and not exercising. Her health scare pushed her to begin documenting her running journey with the public, sharing everything from her experiences of night running to talking about her fitness endeavors as a plus-size woman sometimes coming in DFL\u2014\u201ddead fucking last\u201d\u2014at trail races.\n\nAs a fellow runner and friend, I\u2019ve had the pleasure of celebrating an annual New Year\u2019s Day hike at Anthony\u2019s Nose with Valerio. This year, I couldn\u2019t help but ask a multitude of questions, wondering what sparked her to write her memoirs while also trying to balance her private life, teaching, training for the Boston Marathon and touring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cActually, there is no balance; it\u2019s sort of a myth,\u201d she joked.\n\nThe boarding school where she works has been exceptionally accommodating to her ever-changing schedule, allowing her to maintain employment on a flexible schedule\u2014and allowing her teenage son to stay on campus while she tours several states.\n\nAlthough flattered by the media attention, she says she wanted to tell her own story of how she started her journey. So, since her October 2017 book launch, Merrell and REI have teamed up to help Valerio conduct a multicity sold-out book tour, allowing her to engage with thousands of people from Seattle to New York City.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdmittedly, amid the the waves of support from fans praising her astonishing accolades, she\u2019s consistently had to remind herself about self-care:\n\nWhen I was on the Rich Roll podcast, I had to put my phone down, because all day, I was getting a ton of messages and DMs on Instagram, on Twitter and all of my Facebook pages.\n\nTypically, it\u2019s questions like \u201cWow, how did you get started?\u201d But the Merrell, Skirt Sports and Swiftwick Socks ambassador noted that there are times the questions get tough. Although she strives to answer every message, she hopes that living in her truth will serve as an unspoken example for others to pursue their passions despite shape, size, disability or background:\n\nIt\u2019s cool knowing that people reach out and share themselves in that way; it may sound crass or caustic, but I cannot solve everyone\u2019s problems. I hope that through seeing and observing me through my social media accounts that they do receive the inspiration that they need to get out of whatever hold that they\u2019re in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer ambitious calendar is currently loaded with events such as a 50K with the North Face Endurance in Washington, D.C.; a 10K the following day; a host of Tough Mudders; and traveling to the Azores Island to do a trail run.\n\nLike many, I wondered if there were any other books in her future. Although there are no confirmations yet, she hinted that she will be involved in several major projects that will touch on running and beyond.\n\nSo what advice does a motivational speaker and accomplished runner offer to those who want to get themselves started in fitness?\n\nWrite down your goals first. Speak them out to the universe, and then create a plan. If you want to start running or start weightlifting, write it down. Make sure that goal is actually achievable; you should have a SMART goal or plan. Break up your goals into smaller ones. Temper your schedule accordingly, and then work towards each goal without overwhelming yourself with the bigger goals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, I personally suggest creating and sticking your vision board somewhere visible, like on your refrigerator; actually look at it. Be patient with your body. Stop retraumatizing yourself with negative stories.\n\nJust like when you tell yourself something positive while practicing self-love and care, negative thoughts work the same, in the opposite way. When you continue being overcritical of yourself, it retraumatizes you and may even change your DNA.

There were thriving and ideological-diverse cities surrounded by expansive and bucolic countrysides. There was modern technology perfectly weaved in to cultural tradition, a melding that was symbiotic instead of antagonistic. And while I didn\u2019t see this happening during the movie, I\u2019m sure Wakanda has amazing bottomless brunches.\n\nUnfortunately, a present-day attempt to recreate Wakanda would be unrealistic. Mainly because we\u2019re roughly 20,000 years behind Wakandan tech. And mostly because we\u2019re too infected with colonization and its myriad residues and peripheral effects. Also, we\u2019re a little short on Vibranium.\n\nOne thing, however, that we can and definitely should start doing is what M\u2019Baku and his Que Dog Jabari Tribe did when encountering a problematic white dude who was speaking when there was no ask or need or purpose for the thoughts and opinions of problematic white dudes.\n\nBark.\n\nNot a purposeless bark. This isn\u2019t a shih tzu barking through the window at a squirrel. Instead this would be an intentional bark. A targeted bark. An overpowering bark. A drowning bark. A Wakandan bark. A bark meant to communicate \u201cUm, who told you that you can speak? When it is time for your words, we will let you know. And maybe that time will never come. We\u2019ll see. Now, just shut up and stand there. Maybe get on your phone and google \u2018How not to be a colonizer.\u2019 Whatever you do, I want to hear you not speaking.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bark doesn\u2019t just have to be a counter for useless words, either. A wayward white hand reaches for your hair? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! A group of white people huddled on a sidewalk refuse to step aside when you attempt to walk past them? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! A purse is clutched when you walk on an elevator? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! (If they\u2019re going to act scared, you might as well give them a reason to be.)\n\nOf course, this barking will take some practice. They can\u2019t be small dog barks, so people with higher and/or softer voices will probably have to do some training. Which is why, today, I\u2019m announcing the opening the M\u2019Baku School of Wakandan White Silencing. The classes will be free, so no worries about me using GoFundMe monies for bigen and Creatine.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Also, the bark was actually an ape grunt. But it sounded like a bark and his momma named it a bark so we gonna call it a bark.)\n\n", "keywords": ["wakanda", "woof", "turn", "words", "start", "mbaku", "bark", "need", "white", "walk", "maybe", "barking", "problematic", "wakandan", "speak"], "polarity": 0.03543425060453869, "subjectivity": 0.42281746031746037},

In Pittsburgh alone, there are at least 26 different grades of whiteness, including garden-variety Yinzer whiteness, Appalachian-adjacent whiteness, well-meaning Patagonia whiteness, Lululemon whiteness and Ben Roethlisberger.\n\nAnd sometimes, as in the story about Belen Aldecosea\u2014the Florida woman who, when allegedly told that she wasn\u2019t allowed to bring her emotional-support hamster on a plane, allegedly flushed said hamster down the toilet\u2014the levels of whiteness converge to form a whiteness souffl\u00e9. A whiteness manicotti. A whiteness Thai fried rice.\n\nAnyway, there are too many levels of whiteness in this story to list at one time, so I\u2019ll just name 10.\n\n1. The fact that she has an emotional-support animal. Because the only emotional 0-support animals black people get are lice in prison bunk beds.\n\n2. The fact that her emotional-support animal is a fucking hamster. Hamsters are cute and great and all, but there\u2019s nothing about a hamster that has ever made me think, \u201cI wish that hamster would give me a hug.\u201d This must have been a charismatic-ass hamster. The Mahershala Ali of hamsters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. The fact that she attempted to bring a gotdamn rodent on a plane. The bulk of my adult life has been spent intentionally avoiding enclosed places where rodents might be. I\u2019ve never, ever, ever, ever been in a place and thought, \u201cYou know what this space needs? More rodents.\u201d\n\n4. Again, the fact that she attempted to bring a gotdamn rodent on a plane. I\u2019m so wary of airport security that I practically fly naked now and my only carry-on is a ziplock bag, and she\u2019s trying to get gotdamn rats through the X-ray machine.\n\n5. The fact that, after being told, \u201cNo, you cannot bring this rat on the plane with you, you silly motherfucker,\u201d she reportedly flushed it down the toilet. Apparently, her rationale was that this was a humane way to get rid of it. But on my list of terrible ways to die, drowning to death in an airport toilet is pretty damn near the top. Also, why not just let him loose in a Chick-fil-A or something? Of course, he\u2019d probably get caught and killed, but at least he\u2019d die with a full stomach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAND IF THIS ANIMAL IS SO IMPORTANT TO YOU, WHY DON\u2019T YOU JUST LEAVE THE AIRPORT AND CATCH A GOTDAMN MEGABUS?\n\n6. The fact that she has a gotdamn lawyer. Which means a lawsuit is a possibility.\n\n7. The fact that her gotdamn lawyer was quoted as saying, \u201cThis was a highly stressful situation, and people react in a lot of different ways. She\u2019s only 21 years old, a kid still,\u201d despite the fact that she\u2019s 21 FUCKING YEARS OLD, WHICH MEANS SHE IS NOT A KID STILL.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8.

At the tender age of 32, this year has marked his sixth at the helm of the French luxury label, and it was his biggest to date. Since June, Rousteing has overseen the opening of a Beverly Hills, Calif., flagship boutique, a collaboration with Victoria\u2019s Secret for its annual runway show, the launch of now-sold-out designs for Beats by Dre and even costumes for the Paris Opera Ballet.\n\nBut one of Rousteing\u2019s lowest-profile collaborations is also one of his most accessible, and with Christmas gifts now bought and opened, \u2019tis the time in the season to treat yourself.\n\nIn Balmain\u2019s first venture into beauty, it recently teamed up with fellow French classic L\u2019Oreal Paris to create a Color Riche capsule collection of 12 of-the-moment matte shades, including a classic red aptly named \u201cDomination,\u201d a metallic army green labeled \u201cBalmain Instinct\u201d and a brown called \u201cPower\u201d that reminds us of the beloved \u201cBrazil Nut\u201d we rocked in high school.

Her rich roots and passion for culinary arts were inspired by cooking with her grandmother at a very young age; years later, she\u2019d moonlight in the hospitality industry after earning credentials from Eastern Michigan University to be a social worker.\n\n\u201cI always worked at least two jobs, and if one of them was cooking, I was very happy,\u201d says Scott.\n\nAfter getting laid off from her position as a social worker\u2014and eventually hitting rock bottom\u2014she explored opportunities in the culinary field.\n\n\u201cI cannot say that [culinary] was really my choice; it was very organic. The only other thing I loved was food and cooking. I lost my home, car, everything\u2014that\u2019s how my first real cooking job came about. I decided to work on a major cruise line.\u201d\n\nFour years after her full-time transition into the hospitality industry, Scott enrolled in culinary school\u2014and quickly learned how complicated the business can be. An internship with the Food Network provided her initial exposure to culinary media, food styling and networking with established peers, eventually allowing her to gain culinary clients of her own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShortly after, she pursued her master\u2019s degree in entertainment business from Full Sail University and transitioned into a career as a culinary producer: a multifaceted position that dabbles in all areas on set to run a smooth production. Her experience now includes being the culinary producer of season 2 of Bravo\u2019s hit television show Chef Roble and Company, Throwdown With Bobby Flay and the Cooking Channel.\n\nProgressing her way through a multilayered industry, she landed more exceptional positions, working alongside The Chew\u2019s Carla Hall at the Barbados Food, Wine and Rum Festival and becoming a food stylist for Michael Symon and Daphne Oz.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlossoming in the culinary industry has been a blessing, but despite her qualifications, Scott has experienced disappointment in the field she loves, being passed up for many opportunities. She explains:\n\nI vividly remember being called by the hiring manager of a major network with excitement in her voice, [calling me] the \u201cperfect candidate.\u201d I was told that I\u2019d be moving to the next round of interviews, and then I didn\u2019t get a call back. Inquiring about the follow-up, I was met with her less-than-enthusiastic\u2014almost bothered\u2014tone. The job was given to a young woman who just finished her internship\u2014she was white. That\u2019s just one example, and there are quite a few\u2014each one heartbreaking and disconcerting. The takeaway for me was that when something new or different is happening, it\u2019s always met with resistance. I always knew that it was my personal mission to end these cycles by breaking down these barriers. I later learned that like any building, there\u2019s ways to get in other than the front door; I began to curate my career, diversify my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and make myself marketable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd she did\u2014Scott is the founder of SheChef, a culinary mentorship and leadership program for aspiring women chefs and professionals.\n\nIn a male-dominated industry, chef Elle noted that food styling and culinary production are not. \u201cThese are probably two of few areas dominated by women, [but] women of color remain a minority in these areas.\u201d She cites culinary producers like like Ma\u2019at Zachary and owners of Powerhouse Productions Rochelle Brown and Sonia Armstead as excellent examples in the industry, while Rosecleer-Marie Powell and Sade Aguila are two of many slaying the food styling game.\n\nBut Scott\u2019s rise in the culinary world was interrupted by her diagnosis with stage 1C, grade 3 ovarian cancer\u2014a cancerous tumor resting on her right ovary. Enduring six rounds of chemotherapy over a five-month period and laparoscopic surgery removing her ovary and right fallopian tube, she experienced emotional and physical changes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI dealt with perpetual nausea but never once vomited, extreme fatigue and worked all about a total of eight days within that five-month period,\u201d she says. \u201cI was on a large amount of steroids, getting medication\u2014Taxol and Carboplatin\u2014intravenously and gained 23 pounds that I\u2019m still struggling to lose. I couldn\u2019t eat much unless it was salty; lost all of my hair, even my eyelashes. I had my last round of chemo at the end of January 2017.\u201d\n\nShe credited cancer with curing her of \u201cpersonal vanity\u201d and opts to spend more time being \u201cpresent,\u201d valuing life a bit more. This January will mark a year in remission, but whenever she experiences aches, pains and changes that aren\u2019t documented as side effects, she\u2019s a bit skeptical.\n\n\u201cAnyone having unattended health issues: GO TO THE DOCTOR!\u201d she urges. \u201cI feel like people of color, especially black Americans, have issues with approaching health care in this country\u2014not that I blame them one bit. As it relates to cancer and most other diseases, early detection can and possibly will save your life. Genetic testing is a new tool for detection; request it and accept it if offered. As clich\u00e9d as it sounds, stay positive. I believe healing begins in the mind and resonates through the body.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScott advises fighters and survivors to embrace their feelings\u2014good or bad. Despite others\u2019 perspectives, take as much rest as needed and do as many things you enjoy as you can. \u201cCancer is what you had or have, not who you are,\u201d she says.

You could say that the owner of high-end hair boutique Desired Extensions was born into the beauty industry: Her parents own All-in-1 Beauty Supply, an Atlanta beauty emporium that has served local residents for the past 40 years.\n\nConwell began working in the family business as a sales rep in her early 20s; she tells The Glow Up that her own passion for hair began when she started working with local hairstylists:\n\nIn the midst of that, I became educated on hair loss, growing hair, styling hair\u2014don\u2019t let me style your hair, but I can tell you about growing your hair. And from there, I started meeting a lot of stylists telling me about how their clients were losing hair, and some of the different issues that they were having.\n\nConwell began researching different hair-loss issues, learning about alopecia and the effects of chemotherapy, and talking with doctors about the different ways that their patients were affected.\n\nIdentifying a market uniquely in need of quality full-lace wigs and hair extensions, she began searching for the best hair available, personally wearing various products for almost two years before beginning to sell to the public. In 2009, Desired Extensions was born as its own Atlanta storefront.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlmost a decade later, the brand is thriving, specializing in women suffering from hair loss and in need of high-quality solutions at a reasonable price point (Desired Extensions hair products start at $115). Conwell prides her brand on providing undetectable, confidence-restoring solutions for women desperately in need, regularly giving one-on-one video consultations and even making hospital visits:\n\nI would say what drove my passion was when I started meeting women, and they were ashamed or in tears about their hair loss. And I would have women calling me sometimes saying, \u201cWill there be anyone else in the store? Can we meet alone? Can you come to my house and meet me? I don\u2019t even want to leave my house.\u201d And so, that\u2019s when I saw the seriousness of that. ... We have some pieces that are strictly for if you have alopecia, or are going through chemo with complete hair loss. Then, we have other pieces [for] if you have a head full of hair and want to sew your piece down, or you want to clip it down. ... [But] each time a consumer purchases from us, we always do a consultation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConwell is also fastidious about her suppliers, ensuring that she is never without a source of the highest-quality hair and that her vendors\u2019 preparation processes provide the best-possible experience for her clients, especially when many are already dealing with the stress of an illness. Says Conwell:\n\nI look for [the vendors\u2019] knowledge of hair. Are they familiar with cuticles? Are they familiar with steam-processing hair or do they chemically process hair? What will qualify a company is if they use steam processing\u2014we don\u2019t use any chemicals. Because companies that are using chemicals\u2014when you see some women patting their head, and their scalp is really itchy\u2014that is not a natural thing for extensions. People think that it\u2019s natural, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s usually that that company processes their hair extensions with chemicals, and you\u2019re having an allergic reaction to it ... And there\u2019s another tip with scalp itching: Don\u2019t use synthetic hair. Synthetic hair can make you itch, too. I always tell people: You want to use yarn to add in, instead of using synthetic hair. Dip it down in oil, and it\u2019ll keep your hair moisturized for your whole sew-in. A lot of people don\u2019t know that you don\u2019t have to use synthetic hair. ... But when you use quality hair, and no chemicals have been used, no itching on the scalp.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDesired Extensions also prides itself on providing a variety of textural options: In addition to offering standard straight, wavy, curly and relaxed textures, the brand stocks both kinky-curly and a tighter kinky-ringlet pattern and also offers custom matches. \u201cIf you see that we don\u2019t have a pattern that is your hair pattern, you send us in an image, and we can duplicate that,\u201d Conwell says. \u201cWe can duplicate any pattern, in any texture.\u201d\n\nCustomized wigs are also an option; they\u2019re available in various cap constructions, which Conwell\u2019s small staff of three will personally demonstrate and model via video chat, giving remote clients as close to a storefront experience as possible. Locally in Atlanta, clients can also book hair parties, where guests can play with Desired Extensions\u2019 product line and get much-needed advice on not only wigs and clip-ins but also protective options and hair-loss prevention. She says:\n\nA lot of people are getting away from sew-ins because they want to be versatile and change up their hair often\u2014if your hair is already braided, all you need is the wig to place on, and that alleviates the stylist. And then also, some people [are] complaining about losing their edges, [because] their braids are too tight; sometimes, you\u2019re getting the same braid pattern. When [clients] come to me and say that they\u2019re only losing hair around the edges, I always tell them it can be from stress, it can be from medication, and it can be from your stylist braiding your hair straight back on a regular\u2014you\u2019ve been getting your hair braided straight back like that for a year now. You need to change up your braid pattern at least every three months. That helps tremendously.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEducation\u2014and comfort\u2014are paramount to Conwell, who even consults with clients who can\u2019t afford to purchase from Desired Extensions. Because in the end, Conwell says, her priority is making women feel beautiful, especially when dealing with hair loss:", "keywords": ["lives", "tress", "hair", "dont", "extensions", "conwell", "changing", "loss", "clients", "need", "pattern", "women", "desired"], "polarity": 0.09807060755336619, "subjectivity": 0.4473443223443222},

The iconic Playboy Bunny uniform was designed by Zelda Wynn, also a black designer.

Others offer a bold, futuristic outlook.

Lowe stepped in and completed the project, then attended a segregated design school. She settled in Tampa, Fla., and opened a boutique called Annie Cohen.\n\nShe later moved to New York City, where she did commissions for leading retailers and designed the Oscar gown that Olivia de Havilland wore to accept the award for To Each His Own in 1946.

In fact, you don\u2019t have to search at all. If you\u2019re sitting on a chair at a cubicle right now or standing in line at Einstein\u2019s Bagels, \u201cperfectly justifiable reasons to hate the New England Patriots\u201d permeate the air and will bounce off your forehead like drops of sleet.\n\nYou can hate them because they\u2019ve been caught cheating numerous times. You can hate them because they seem to receive a mysteriously generous amount of questionable refereeing in their favor. You can hate them because they\u2019re from Boston, which is notorious for possessing the most insufferable (and insufferably racist) sports fans (and people).\n\nYou can hate them because their owner, coach and star quarterback are unabashed \u201cMAGA\u201d bots. You can hate them because they\u2019re really fucking good and they\u2019ve been really fucking good for 15 years despite never really being dominant. I\u2019ve never seen a team that, along with being great, also frequently got so damn lucky, and you can hate them for that. You can hate them because Tom Brady is Scientologist-adjacent. If you want to be petty, you can hate them because Robert Kraft is low-key ugly.\n\nAnd yes, it is fine to hate them because Bill Belichick seems to possess a white-skill-position-player generator. Wes Walker. Rob Gronkowski. Danny Woodhead. Chris Hogan. Julian Edelman. Danny Amendola. Rex Burkhead. THESE ARE NOT THE NAMES OF REAL PEOPLE! THESE ARE THE NAMES OF PEOPLE CREATED BY A WHITE-SKILL-POSITION GENERATOR. Besides New England, there are, like, three white running backs and receivers in the NFL total. The Patriots, however, have 952 of them.\n\nThis cannot be a coincidence. It just can\u2019t. If you ordered a pepperoni pizza for a party and you opened the box and saw that one slice had 95 pepperonis while the other seven slices had five total, you\u2019d suspect something was up\u2014that the pizza-maker wanted one person to have all the pepperoni. You don\u2019t know why the pizza-maker made this arbitrarily specific decision, but you know a decision was made. SOMEONE IN NEW ENGLAND IS MAKING THE DECISION TO REFRESH THE BATTERIES FOR THE WHITE-SKILL-POSITION GENERATOR.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then, when you have an unusual number of white players on a team\u2014football and basketball particularly\u2014the way they\u2019re talked about changes. Words like \u201cgrit\u201d and \u201chardworking\u201d and \u201cintelligent\u201d find their way into the columns and comments and news stories about them. They\u2019re \u201cgood locker-room guys\u201d and \u201ccoaches on the field.\u201d They \u201chustle\u201d and they possess an unlimited amount of \u201cguile\u201d and \u201ctoughness.\u201d Their \u201cwork ethics\u201d are impeccable because they\u2019re true \u201cstudents of the game.\u201d\n\nNever mind that Gronkowski is basically white LeBron.

CVS is also asking brands that are sold in its stores to disclose which elements of a model\u2019s appearance have been altered in the ads for products on display.\n\nMSNBC\u2019s Joy Reid moderated a panel that included Matlins, Chief Marketing Officer of CVS Health Norman de Greve, Revlon-endorsed supermodel and body-positive activist Ashley Graham, activist beauty blogger and documentarian Noor Tagouri, and celebrity makeup artist and Honest Beauty spokesman Daniel Martin to discuss how truth in advertising can help alleviate some of the inadequacies we can feel when faced with unobtainable images of beauty presented as reality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong the issues discussed were how how happiness is tied to expectations, and how well our expectations match reality\u2014or not\u2014in the digital era of filters and \u201cliquify\u201d tools that enhance not only professional but amateur photographs. In terms of how this affects self-esteem and body image, the statistics cited by panel members were eye-opening, even for a lot of industry vets in the audience:\n\n\n\n80 percent of women feel worse after looking at beauty ads.\n\n\n\n30 percent of high school girls have some type of eating disorder.\n\n\n\n42 percent of first- to third-graders want to be thinner.\n\n\n\n90 percent of girls ages 15-17 want to change one major thing about themselves.\n\n\n\nThe discussion also covered men and body issues, and boys who \u201cfeel more beautiful when they wear makeup,\u201d like Matlins\u2019 12-year-old son, who writes a blog about beauty for boys. Looking at the statistics\u2014and as a mom in midlife with a blog where I don\u2019t retouch, for all the reasons listed above\u2014I think the time is 100 percent right to make authentic individuality and self-acceptance the highest aspiration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can see the full one-hour talk here.", "keywords": ["photographs", "matlins", "panel", "advertising", "retouch", "feel", "real", "finally", "beauty", "truth", "girls", "cvs", "sold", "products"], "polarity": 0.27337625018659495, "subjectivity": 0.5197216002388416},

(I\u2019m speaking at the University of Alabama this evening), I stopped at a newsstand to get some orange juice and to consider buying one of those neck-pillow things for the flight. (I declined. These things are $17.99 in Pittsburgh, but here it was 37 whole American dollars. Fuck that. I ended up just making a pillow out of an unopened pack of boxer briefs I brought with me. Yup, I\u2019m a grown-ass man, and I just slept on some drawers.)\n\nWhile I was in line, a 20-something white woman in front of me kept glancing back and smirking. I thought perhaps she was a real-life Rose Armitage, so I turned my phone flash on just in case she tried any funny business. She finally spoke.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, has anyone ever told you you look just like Khalid?\u201d\n\nI lied: \u201cNo.\u201d And then I lied again: \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe sings that song \u2018Location.\u2019 You know. \u2018Sendddddd me your location.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs tickled as I was that I was able to get this woman to sing and sway for me, my flight was boarding soon and I had to bounce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve never heard it. Have a good day.\u201d\n\nAs I walked out of the store, I could hear her still singing the chorus of \u201cLocation\u201d softly to herself. And I was just glad I turned my flash on.\n\nIn the last two weeks, I\u2019ve been in Miami, Baltimore, D.C. (twice) and now Birmingham. Along with the airports in those cities, I\u2019ve had layovers in Charlotte, N.C., and Atlanta. And in that 14-day span, I\u2019ve had five separate nonblack people (three white women, a white man and an Asian man) mention that I look like Khalid\u2014an artist I had to Google a few months ago after another white woman in Pittsburgh said I looked like him. Yet when I\u2019ve shared this information with black people\u2014that white people keep telling me I look like him\u2014their responses range from \u201cWTF?\u201d to \u201cOf course. Because we all look alike to them.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy wife thinks (most) white people are just unable or unwilling to find any distinctions with black people\u2019s faces. That they just see the similarities with our hair, our beards and our complexions, but what we actually look like just doesn\u2019t register. This would explain the other person white people frequently tell me I remind them of: Donald Glover. Which is even more perplexing for what I assume are very, very, very, very, very obvious reasons. (Also, it\u2019s interesting that both Khalid and Donald Glover are considerably smaller men than I am, which makes me wonder if white people just automatically assign an exaggerated physical size to black men. Which, again, makes me glad my phone has a flash function.)\n\nAnyway, most of the black people I\u2019ve shared this story with also have stories about white people stopping them to tell them they look like people. Apparently this is the world\u2019s most annoying silent epidemic. But after an informal poll I conducted on Google Hangouts just now, none of these black people are walking up to random white people to tell them they look exactly like Steve Nash.\n\nSo basically, the moral of the story is that if you\u2019re a white person and you think some random black person looks like some other random black person, keep those thoughts to yourself. Because you\u2019re probably wrong. They\u2019ll probably be annoyed.

The lessons in Mr. Church have too much sauce. All shade aside, I actually enjoyed the movie; we all could use our own Mr. Church. Pretend that didn\u2019t sound slave-y.\n\nNot for nothing, but I\u2019d be really curious about the real Mr. Church\u2019s view of the movie and the story told of his life, though he passed on many years ago. Not that it\u2019s a bad one; it\u2019s just interesting. What makes Mr. Church a pantheon-level Magical Negro? A Magical Negro\u2019s Magical Negro? I\u2019m glad you asked. Here are 10 reasons:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. The entire premise of this movie is textbook Magical Negro-dom. A random black man shows up in the home of a white woman dying from breast cancer and her daughter to serve as their cook until the mother dies, projected to be in six months. I think the original title of the film was White Mom, Black Cook, but horny focus-group participants kept punching that into the search box on XVideos and it just got freaky.\n\nBack to the lecture at hand: Where does he come from? I haven\u2019t the foggiest. Some other person set the shit up. All we know is that he\u2019s there and the foods are going to get cooked come hell or high water. Also, he\u2019s been entreated with the responsibility of paying all of the bills from some mythical account for everything. Listen, while I\u2019d be leery if some random black man showed up to my house hovering over my not-quite-KitchenAid pots and pans, the minute he said, \u201cI got this, boo-boo\u201d as I looked at my Pepco bill, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d call him \u201cZaddy.\u201d\n\n2. When the mother lives an additional SIX YEARS, apparently, Mr. Magical Negro pays for all the bills out of his own pockets once that six-month fund runs low. How so? Well, in the FIRST place, he was offered a lifetime salary in exchange for cooking for six months, till the mother died. So, all that money he DID make when she lived? He poured right back into that household. Why for come? Because that\u2019s what a Magical Negro does; he fills a need where he sees one. Like reading to the mother nightly while she lay in bed searching for energy. Reading. Over and over. That\u2019s magic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. UPPING that ante, he goes to the supermarket one day and learns how much he saves by using coupons. Well, turns out he saves all of the savings over the course of the next, like, six or seven years, and when Charlie, the daughter, is all ready to go to college and gets into Boston University but can\u2019t afford it, there\u2019s Mr. Church right there with an envelope of all his coupon savings to cover her tuition. He gave her, like, $5,000. Do you know how much Hennessy he could have bought with $5,000? In 1977? But nope, he\u2019s here handing out magical envelopes. Of cash. To white teenagers. And cars.\n\n4. Here\u2019s part of his \u00fcber-magical nature: Charlie, the daughter who grows up and is who Mr. Church largely takes care of in life, hates reading books as a child. Especially books brought into her motherfucking establishment by some random black man who cooks delectable eats. Or, at least, she does at first. Over time, he introduces her to all the classics through his library system of having her check out books he brings over. She went from reading street signs to all of the classics. He gave her culture and depth. I salute you, Mr. Church.\n\n5. He always calls Charlie \u201cmy dear.\u201d It\u2019s reminiscent of The Princess Bride\u2019s Dread Pirate Roberts, aka Westley, and his constant refrain of \u201cas you wish\u201d to Princess Buttercup. Such a good movie. The Princess Bride, that is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. In true Magical Negro fashion, we never really learn much about Mr. Church\u2019s background until he dies. Turns out he was not only a great cook but also played the piano at a spot called Jelly\u2019s every weekend. In my mind, all Magical Negroes meet up at Jelly\u2019s on Sundays for brunch. His father was a horrible man and a mean cuss. But Mr. Church has always loved Charlie and her mother for giving him something he didn\u2019t have: a family. Which is Magical Negro parlance for, \u201cI\u2019ve never had one before.\u201d \u201cA room to yourself?\u201d \u201cA bed.\u201d [Half-smile.] Scene.\n\n7. Piggybacking on No. 6, Mr. Church has one rule: \u201cRespect his privacy.\u201d What does the white girl do? Charlie goes white girl and does not respect his privacy and digs and snoops through his shit and gets caught. And because Magical Negroes DO make mistakes on occasion\u2014he also often gets drunk when he\u2019s at Jelly\u2019s\u2014he puts her ass RIGHT out for snooping. But she\u2019s ALSO like hella pregnant and has nowhere to go, except to some store where some kid on a skateboard runs into her and her old friend from the neighborhood, Larson, happens to see her and gets her to the hospital, where Mr. Church magically shows up to claim her and bring her home.\n\n8. In what can only be described as a Magical Negro by Osmosis, it turns out that Larson was about to commit suicide with liquor and pills when Charlie got hit by the boy on a skateboard, and he had to help save her life, which, in turn, helped save his life. Mr. Church is out here saving white people by association.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Charlie has her baby and then one of her former friends comes back into the picture and is now rich and snobby and Charlie wants to drop her as a friend. Mr. Church tells her not to get caught up in that shit. He\u2019s saving white relationships.\n\n10. Mr. Church ends up getting sick and dying and shit. Before he does that, though, he ends up teaching Charlie how to cook, play piano, garden, live, breathe, not die and ultimately be a good human. And he gave her the most important Magical Negro gift of all: She was able to write a story about him and became an author, thereby creating a job and livelihood by virtue of his very existence in her life.\n\nTo Mr. Church, a Magical Negro like no other.", "keywords": ["negrod", "reasons", "mr", "magically", "negro", "movie", "church", "charlie", "magical", "white", "shit", "mother", "does"], "polarity": 0.1633413283413283, "subjectivity": 0.5720266695266695},

Instead, I\u2019m curled up with my laptop this fine Saturday afternoon, editing and writing blogs for The Glow Up.\n\nBut there\u2019s definite gratification in writing about an amazing project like the Free Black Women\u2019s Library, a growing collection of books written by black women and collected and curated by artist, librarian and avowed book lover Ola Ronke.\n\nRonke started the project after becoming involved with the #SayHerName movement in response to a spate of stories about state-sanctioned violence that harmed and killed black women.\n\n\u201cI was kind of like, \u2018OK, I want to be a part of something where black women are centered and where black women are the focus. But it\u2019s not tragic, and it\u2019s not pathological, and it doesn\u2019t feel disempowering or discouraging. ... You know, we can talk about us black women as writers and artists and filmmakers and creatives and all these different things,\u2019\u201d Ronke told The Glow Up.\n\n\u201cSo, at the same time, we can also have conversations about this violence and about these issues ... but within these conversations will be more of a position of power,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe won\u2019t feel victimized or objectified or like a stereotype, but more like witches and healers and conjurers and problem-solvers and scientists and doctors ... just kind of, like, shifting energy around the conversation that takes place where black women are the focus.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe result was a mobile library of black female-centric books, where participants are encouraged to give one and take one, all in an effort to advance black female narratives.\n\n\u201cIt was my love of books and my wanting to connect with people around black women, but in a way that felt like a celebration or an honoring or an affirming,\u201d Ronke noted.\n\nSince launching three years ago, the library has grown to approximately 900 books. It was initially primarily based on donations but is now moving into sponsorships and collaborations. It\u2019s even launched a Reading Challenge for 2018 and a reading group, which you can join here:\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis Sunday, Jan. 28, Ronke and the Free Black Women\u2019s Library will help launch MFON: Women Photographers of the African Diaspora, a crowdfunded photography book celebrating various iterations of black womanhood. The project clearly reflects the mission Ronke has begun with her library.\n\n\u201cWe are celebrating the release of the gorgeous new photography book MFON: Women Photographers of the African Diaspora,\u201d she says. \u201cThis stunning work of art features the work of 118 black women photographers from all over the world. The brilliant women behind this work are Laylah Amatullah Barrayn and Adama Delphine Fawundu, founding co-editors-in-chief, and Crystal Whaley, deputy editor.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Ronke, both the library and events like these are a necessary next step in expanding the exposure and understanding of black womanhood.\n\n\u201cBlack women are variable and expansive\u2014and, like, different\u2014and there\u2019s really no way to categorize that. Because under the umbrella of black women, we could have a black trans person, or you could have a black person who wears a weave or locs or has a low cut or is skinny or in a wheelchair, you know? And we also have stay-at-home moms and the Wall Street executive. ... There [are] just so many ways to be a black woman.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe adds, \u201cSo, that was part of it, too: just pushing back against this idea that there\u2019s one type of black woman. We\u2019re not a monolith; we\u2019re just, like, so varied. And we can be whatever it is that we want; and that, in and of itself, is awesome.\u201d\n\nThe Glow Up tip: You can support the Free Black Women\u2019s Library by donating to its Crowdrise account below.

I\u2019m one of those semi-road-warrior types who collects miles and points on my weekly trips in and around the United States to sit in meetings where I add marginal value, eat boxed lunches and internally critique PowerPoint font choices. I\u2019m TSA Precheck. I have airline status. I judge people\u2019s attire based on the ease with which they can pass through the security screening.\n\nLong story short, I spend a lot of time in airports. Honestly, I think airports are one of the truly fascinating places to people-watch because of the overall temporary nature of just about everyone there. Someone\u2019s leaving town, someone else is heading out on vacation. Another person just closed a deal, while the person beside them is hoping that they\u2019re gonna get that job. Interspersed in all of this are the people going to meet their grandkids for the first time and an occasional \u201cThis is my first time flying\u201d person.\n\nBut there we all are, together at the airport, traveling hither and yon, connected by a few minutes at the bar sipping our preferred form of preflight courage while checking smartphones and flight statuses and taking in the ever-ubiquitous presence of CNN on the airport TV screens.\n\nFor the most part, the conversations are benign:\n\n\u201cWhere ya headed?\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s home?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhaddya do?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long ya going for?\u201d\n\n\n\nUsually it\u2019s brief, a chat with a few laughs, some minor discoveries about each other, and then someone hops off their stool, downs the rest of the IPA and hightails it off to the gate to make their flight to Phoenix or Tulsa, Okla., or Newark, N.J.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as with any situation that involves booze, loose associations, acceptable generalizations, a somewhat diverse crowd and a TV screen showing a constant stream of CNN, sometimes the conversations can get a little contentious.\n\nA little while ago, I found myself in my usual spot at an airport bar after a long day of corporate tap dancing and professional mask-wearing, nursing a glass of Templeton Rye on the rocks and working my way through my usual grilled cheese sandwich with tomatoes, when I overheard two rather loud and somewhat intoxicated late-middle-aged white men accosting the TV screen and yammering on about that specific topic of the news and how that was specifically the thing that was destroying this country.\n\n\n\nI couldn\u2019t get the initial gist of their complaints, since I was kinda in my own world at the moment, but as I grasped what was on CNN and used context clues to put two and two together (shoutout to Ms. Pugh-Scott\u2019s second-grade class, y\u2019all), I realized that these men had been whipped into a frothy tirade over immigration. Namely, the fact that \u201ceveryone\u201d seemed so afraid to call these countries where all these immigrants and \u201cillegals\u201d (their words, not mine) came from the veritable \u201cshitholes\u201d that they are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSee, we used to call it the \u2018Third World,\u2019 and it was, you know, countries that might\u2019ve been poor or not as sophisticated as us, and so we wanted to reach out to them, maybe train some doctors from there, teach some of their folks how we do business here, and then they were supposed to go back home to build their own damn countries!\u201d\n\n\u201cYep. These people keep staying here because they know they don\u2019t want to go back to those Third World countries. But instead of going home and helping their own people, they wanna use chain migration and bring their brothers and sisters and all their kids, and eventually we got the whole damn village to support with OUR tax dollars. It\u2019s bullshit, if you ask me.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, I knew I should have just minded my own business, but the way my woke is set up, I couldn\u2019t let it pass without saying something. See, I come from an immigrant family myself, and as a Liberian, I know the Trump administration rescinded temporary protected status for many of my family and countrymen last May. My wife is an immigrant, as are her parents, and so our children are the only members of our family born in America. I work at a company full of immigrants. Hell, I had the self-awareness to see that the bartenders at the airport and the people running the food were also immigrants.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here we were, with me now forced to speak up in the face of willful ignorance and Fox News talking points with facts, logic and reason that these men were too old, too drunk and too white to accept. The irony notwithstanding that, in their defense of their own bigotry and self-serving view of Americanness, they shamelessly referenced the corpses of their own immigrant ancestors as if they had arrived on these shores welcomed with open arms and personally ready to start the tech companies and hedge funds of their day.\n\n\n\nAs the conversation teetered dangerously close to me having to call them the nativist racists that they were, and as the bar staff was becoming visually uncomfortable with their characterizations of \u201cthose Latinos,\u201d God intervened with an announcement that the flight to Dallas (or Houston, or Little Rock, Ark., or just generically Dixieland) was boarding and they ambled off their stools, shook my hand, and we wished each other safe travels. I mean, fuck those guys, but I\u2019m pretty sure everyone on their flight wasn\u2019t racist, and I wouldn\u2019t want them to suffer the karmic repercussions of the dumbass opinions of those two assholes.\n\nBut somehow, it got worse.\n\nAfter those men left, a youngish white couple, male and female, dressed in their vacation clothes, who had been sitting there all along, decided to chime in. But to, like, thank me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, my God. We heard what was going on over there, and it\u2019s just so refreshing to see someone actually, like, you know, speak up against those kinds of people.\u201d\n\nYeah, I mean, thanks, I guess, but that actually pissed me off even more: the fact that I, as the aggrieved party, had to speak up for myself and by extension those similarly situated around me (who were in no position to say anything), while Tad and Becca sat on the sidelines and offered only silence as support. I\u2019m sure that in their minds and in the story they\u2019d tell about the incident, they were on the right side of the argument and would pat themselves on the back for not sharing the opinions of the other two men at that bar.\n\nWhite people who want to be \u201callies\u201d need to understand that their agreement isn\u2019t enough. It\u2019s not enough for you to nod while I defend myself, or to bristle when something offensive is said or done to a member of a minority or marginalized community. Nah. There\u2019s just not enough of us to fight this battle alone, and if white people want to prove their worth in the struggle, they\u2019re going to need to speak the fuck up at the exact moment of the offense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOtherwise, it\u2019s just a different form of complicity. It\u2019s the decision to choose your own comfort over the discomfort of others. It\u2019s the purest form of privilege, and it needs to be treated with the same derision as abject and active racism. Otherwise, you\u2019re not an ally; you\u2019re just another enemy. You gotta pick a side and then you gotta actually work. Complicity is more dangerous than any outwardly racist act.\n\n\n\nOn the bright side, they did pay for my Templeton Rye on the rocks and my grilled cheese sandwich, so I guess they weren\u2019t all bad.", "keywords": ["dont", "enemies", "allies", "im", "going", "airport", "work", "need", "white", "world", "know", "flight", "men", "speak"], "polarity": 0.05962957875457874, "subjectivity": 0.4479105616605617},

My wife and I drove to Washington, D.C., after biking from Pittsburgh to Cumberland, Md., on a four-day and 150-mile trek that I still plan to write about eventually, but remain too traumatized by to write about yet.\n\nWe arrived Saturday evening, went out and stayed the night with the friends we made the bike trip with, and had all of Sunday in D.C. before flying back to Pittsburgh Monday morning. We decided to try to visit \u201cthe Blacksonian\u201d since neither of us had been.\n\nBut, as we quickly learned, if you\u2019re not on any waiting lists (and we weren\u2019t), the only way to get same-day tickets is to get up at the butt crack of dawn and check online (which we didn\u2019t do). Plus, it was the Sunday before Labor Day, which meant the National Mall would be even busier than usual, and any chance of scoring walk-up tickets would be scarce.\n\nRunning out of options, I made a Facebook status about our predicament and asked if anyway knew of any other way. Luckily, one of my friends messaged me that veterans can get into Smithsonian museums whenever they want, and since her dad is a vet, he\u2019d meet us there and get us in.\n\nI connected with her dad and agreed to meet him in front of the museum at 3 p.m. When I asked how we\u2019d know it was him, he replied in a typical 75-year-old black-man way: \u201cYou won\u2019t miss me. I\u2019ll be the handsomest man there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, he was right. We saw him near the entrance where we agreed to meet. Decked out in an exquisitely tailored charcoal-gray suit, black-and-gray oxfords and a burgundy bowtie, he immediately reminded me of Ossie Davis.\n\nWe introduced ourselves, shook his hand and thanked him, and he replied, \u201cNot a problem. It\u2019s my pleasure.\u201d\n\nWe spoke for a couple more minutes, and we learned that he\u2019d just left church and post-church brunch with his family\u2014which is probably why he was so extra-super sharp\u2014and that he fulfills this request for people frequently. When we apologized for interrupting his day, he corrected us: \u201cNo. I consider this a duty.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you enter the Blacksonian, the guides suggest that you start at the basement (which is where the time spanning the trans-Atlantic slave trade is documented and displayed) and work your way back up to the top floor. The museum was packed, so we had to wait in line to get on an elevator that would take us down there. There were a few dozen people in front of us, but the line moved swiftly and efficiently, and we were on the elevator within 10 minutes.\n\nThe basement was everything you\u2019d expect an entire floor devoted to the hundreds of years that black people were in bondage in America would be. It was fucking heavy. And hard. And scary. And sad. Even now, six months after I was on that floor, the thought of it heats and wells my eyes. Some people were crying. Others just staring, silent and blank and sad and seething, at the exhibits. Some of those who brought young children were attempting to educate them while also visibly fighting the urge not to be overcome by emotion. And everyone was respectful of the weight and the temperature of that room.\n\n\n\nWell, mostly everyone.\n\nThe crowd was maybe 70 percent percent black. And those who didn\u2019t happen to be black appeared to be just as moved by what was being experienced. But there was one 40-something white man there who, on at least three separate occasions, bumped into other museumgoers while he was attempting to take pictures and text.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey weren\u2019t egregious or violent bumps; he didn\u2019t knock anyone off balance. But they were the type of bumps where you\u2019d look up after being bumped because you\u2019d expect that person to stop what he was doing and apologize. Which is exactly what each person did after being bumped.\n\nNo apology came, however, as this guy was too transfixed with his phone to even notice. In a different environment, this type of social faux pas around black people would have induced at least a couple of \u201cUm. Excuse you\u201ds. Instead, he was just met by head shakes and looks of disgust. They weren\u2019t going to let him ruin their experience.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, I joined my friend Deesha Philyaw onstage at the Summit Against Racism for a talk titled, \u201cHow Not to Be a Racist Shithead.\u201d For 45 minutes, we addressed the predominantly white audience of 300, and basically just spent our time finding different ways to say, \u201cWhite people, you need to do better.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToward the end of our talk, I brought up the idea that white people need to learn how to be guests. If you are in someone else\u2019s house and they ask you to take off your shoes before stepping onto their floor, you take off your shoes. And if you are the type of person who usually wears shoes without socks, do your research and put some fucking socks on before you leave your house.\n\nIt\u2019s a concept many white people seem to struggle with. That not all things are theirs. And that some things will never have owners because they cannot be owned. And some things belong to other people. And whether those things are dialects or music or histories or actual bodies, that a proper reverence for them must be possessed before engaging with them.\n\nWhen thinking about this, I can\u2019t help thinking about that day at the Blacksonian. And all of the things we had to do that day just to get tickets. And that beautiful man helping us out, as he\u2019s helped others, because he knows how important it is for that space to be witnessed and experienced. And the rows of (mostly black) people, waiting patiently and anxiously to be taken to a floor displaying the horrors our ancestors were forced through. And the faces of the people engaging with those exhibits. The sadness and the anger and the shock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then this white guy, either oblivious to or just not giving a shit about his surroundings, bumping into people. And not giving enough of a shit to notice.", "keywords": ["better", "black", "learn", "day", "youd", "things", "floor", "guest", "werent", "didnt", "person", "way", "white", "type"], "polarity": 0.016623178951946087, "subjectivity": 0.4481680800173951},

The note read, \u201cTo my niggas in Paris\u201d\u2014a quip and a nod, I suppose, to the Jay-Z-and-Kanye song.\n\nNeedless to say, the backlash was swift and harsh, and by Tuesday morning, Sergeenko posted the most hilarious nonapology of all time, except it only served to add fuel to the fire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this nonapology, the fact that her daughter is part Armenian, and she grew up in a small town in East Kazakhstan, somehow became pertinent information because of her use of the word.

After years of modeling, it wasn\u2019t an unfamiliar scenario, but this was different. I wasn\u2019t being fit for a retailer\u2019s catalog or campaign, but for one of the biggest nights of my life. I was fitting for the Grammys, as a first-time nominee.\n\nMy trusty stylist had managed to procure samples from a few known designers\u2014difficult for an unknown artist\u2014but would they fit? At the time, because of a restrictive diet and rigorous daily gym habit, I was a size 6 (a lifestyle choice that ran contrary to my ongoing career as a plus-size model). It was the smallest I\u2019d ever be as an adult. But even at my smallest, after years spent in the modeling industry, I also knew that my average-black-girl proportions\u2014thick thighs, wide hips and a voluptuousness that wouldn\u2019t be exercised into submission\u2014weren\u2019t an ideal fit for high fashion.\n\nNearly eight years later, my diet is far less strict, and my steadfast hourglass has returned to a luscious 12-14. But when Leslie Jones was recently denied by multiple designers while searching for a dress for her Ghostbusters premiere, I intimately felt her pain. Like Leslie, I was forced to have an outfit custom-made because even the samples I managed to fit were sadly devoid of personality and often ill-fitting.\n\nNo amount of success or self-care could shield either of us from the humiliating fact that when it came to high fashion, our size somehow made us unworthy of inclusion. Instead, our bodies were somehow expected to offer an apology to an industry that refused to accommodate us instead of recognizing each and every body\u2019s right to look and feel good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it turns out, Leslie and I weren\u2019t alone in taking matters into our own hands. After decades spent watching designers largely ignore even their own body types in their collections (see Anna Sui and the formerly full Donna Karan, among others), it\u2019s no surprise that models and celebrities alike have begun to capitalize on a market that remains underserved even while the press praises a more body-positive climate. For lack of better options, Ashley Graham, Melissa McCarthy and, soon, Orange Is the New Black\u2019s Dascha Polanco\u2014who just took body positivity to new heights by attending a runway show in a thigh-baring bodysuit\u2014are among those channeling their fame, experience and frustration into creating fashion that flatters figures like their own.\n\nBut what of the established designers, who have long possessed the resources and influence to be more inclusive? The party line is that fuller figures are more difficult to design for, but occasionally, the truth is far more brutal: They are simply not interested. We not only don\u2019t fit their clothes; we don\u2019t fit their brand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I write this, New York Fall Fashion Week is in full swing. Early in my career, walking the runway for pioneering retailer Lane Bryant or for a smattering of department store events were among the rare opportunities offered full-figured models during NYFFW. But this year, Christian Siriano\u2014who both famously came to Leslie Jones\u2019 rescue and created his own capsule collection for Lane Bryant\u2014did the unthinkable: He cast several plus-size models in his fall presentation, with neither fanfare nor kitsch.\n\n\u201cI am just trying to show you that you can do it, you can celebrate everyone. \u2026 The clothes looked just as amazing on [the plus models] as everyone else,\u201d he noted in an interview with Refinery29.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile perhaps the most visible, Siriano isn\u2019t the only designer featuring a diversity of bodies on the runway this season. Designer Tracy Reese upped her #BlackGirlMagic quotient by announcing that she\u2019ll now offer at least a portion of her line in extended sizes (up to a size 18/2X), and backed it up by casting a range of people of varying ages and sizes in her show. Legendary designer Byron Lars celebrated the 25th year of his eponymous label (now available in sizes 0-22) with a show themed \u201cExclusive Inclusion,\u201d featuring models and personalities up to a size 18. And sportswear designer Chromat continued a commitment to diverse presentations by featuring not only a variety of body types but also differently abled and transgender models.\n\nSo, yes, the body-positive movement is progressing, and obviously I\u2019m here for it, having invested my career in helping to forward the narrative. But are we really expected to pat designers on the back for acknowledging the obvious: that not only bigger bodies but bigger dollars await them on the other side of inclusion? And for black and brown women in particular, is it fair to ask us to ignore the fact that the bodies the fashion industry consistently seems so incapable of acknowledging most often resemble our own, and our mothers\u2019, sisters\u2019 and friends\u2019?\n\nNo one needs to tell any marginalized group how much representation matters. Being represented honestly and positively in the public perception is something we fight for every day. For the 100 million plus-size women in America alone, our exclusion from the aspirational market that is high fashion is nothing short of defeminizing. Diversity of bodies on the catwalk is a beginning, but without a broader diversity of options in the stores, it\u2019s an empty gesture at best.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Project Runway mentor Tim Gunn notes in an op-ed for the Washington Post, the fashion industry\u2019s dismissal of bigger body types is not only a \u201cdisgrace\u201d but also downright delusional. He states, \u201c[T]his is now the shape of women in this nation, and designers need to wrap their minds around it.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s right. But as a black woman who\u2019s spent the last two decades of my life advocating for respect and representation not only for my race and gender but also the particular body I inhabit, the words that most often come to mind are instead Sojourner\u2019s.\n\nAfter all, \u201cain\u2019t I a woman?\u201d\n\nMaiysha Kai is a Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter, fashion model, devoted auntie and Brooklyn, N.Y.-based, single black bombshell who recently strutted into her 40s.

Aside from the fact that everyone, including family members, was mysteriously kept away from the Turpin home and the fact that David had racked up $500,000 in debt despite earning six figures as an engineer at Northrop Grumman, the couple looked like they should have been investigated.

You\u2019ve now created a brand-new brand of religious philosophy based on Psalms 127:3-5:\n\n3. Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his reward. 4. As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth. 5. Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuiverFull is based on the belief that, like pure white people, good Christians are going out of style because they are being outbred by sinners. The only way for God\u2019s people to build an army of Christian conservatives for the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is by abstaining from birth control and ... you guessed it: fucking.\n\nThe Duggar family from TLC\u2019s 17 Kids and Counting are one of the more prominent adherents of the QuiverFull philosophy, which borrows much of its ideology from the 1985 book The Way Home, by Mary Pride. The book basically says that feminism has wrongly led women to believe that they can achieve happiness without being married, submitting to their husbands and having children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, it\u2019s the belief that women have been indoctrinated with the stupid idea that washing dishes and being obedient to their husbands is not the path to happiness. According to believers, birth control and independence are toxic ideas pushed by the subversive feminist movement to destroy God\u2019s people. (I\u2019m paraphrasing here, but not by much.)\n\nThe movement is estimated to have tens of thousands of adherents, mostly in the United States, and has been plagued by accusations of sexual abuse. Apparently, being fruitful and multiplying has a few negative effects.\n\nMany QuiverFull members, like the Turpins, homeschool their children, which explains why no one noticed the lack of nutrition. The grandparents of the children told reporters that the children memorized long biblical passages during their strict homeschooling, and neighbors stated that the children always looked \u201cvery pale,\u201d according to The Telegraph.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Turpins have been charged with torture and child endangerment. Their bail has been set at $9 million apiece, according to CNN. When asked about bailing the parents out, Liam Neeson did not respond with the following statement:", "keywords": ["quiverfull", "question", "movement", "raises", "turpins", "turpin", "chains", "according", "kept", "morning", "mess", "white", "couple", "looked", "know", "kind", "whitepeople", "children"], "polarity": 0.11403955453149005, "subjectivity": 0.4201182795698924},

You might as well also list \u201ccompatible with oxygen\u201d and \u201chave never eaten my own spleen.\u201d\n\nAnyway, last week our president did something even more overtly racist than the last most overtly racist thing he did. And I have no doubt that he will continue to break his own standards of overtly racist behavior. Each day we might see or hear something we\u2019ve never seen before. He\u2019s basically Usain Bolt in 2008.\n\nAnd I\u2019m here today to defend him.\n\nAs a response to the report that he referred to Haiti, El Salvador and all of Africa as \u201cshithole countries,\u201d he was asked if he was a racist. His immediate reply (\u201cI am not a racist\u201d) stands counter to everything we know about him and everything we know about what constitutes racism. It also might be the truth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe already know that, in the 2016 election, Donald Trump won nearly every measurable and meaningful white demographic: white men, white women, poor whites, rich whites, white people actually named \u201cDwight.\u201d And he won them with a five-word-long platform: \u201cI\u2019m famous and I\u2019m racist.\u201d\n\nThese are also the same people who voted for the senators and state representatives who\u2019d be expected to hold such an overtly racist president accountable.

And it hasn\u2019t\u2014and won\u2019t\u2014come because they agree with him.

But they elected him and continue to support him so he can say and do the things they can\u2019t.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd if the majority of white Americans possess these racist beliefs\u2014and, again, our elections would seem to prove that they do\u2014racism would seem to be the standard. And if something is the standard, it\u2019s not special or distinguishable. At least not special or distinguishable enough to bother distinguishing it.\n\nAnd if this is true, Donald Trump is telling the truth. He is not racist because, for white people, racism is the default. A mundanity. What separates him from the majority of white Americans is his platform and his personal brand of fucklessness.\n\nIt would have been more accurate and more telling if he\u2019d replied instead, \u201cI am not a racist. I am just a white man.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI mean, if he\u2019s not going to lie, he might as well just tell the entire truth.

Now, I\u2019m not saying they are racist, but ...\n\nOK, I\u2019m saying they are racist.\n\nMore specifically, a new study (pdf) by political scientists at Colgate and the University of Minnesota proves they have racist tendencies. That\u2019s not just a popular opinion; it is a statistical fact.\n\nWhen researchers simply asked subjects how they felt about a not-so-complex housing-assistance issue, they were split on their support. But there was a subtle twist to the study: When the information about the issue was accompanied by a picture of a white person, Trump voters were much more likely to support it than when they were cued by an image of a black person. It revealed something we knew all along:\n\nTrump voters aren\u2019t conservatives. They aren\u2019t necessarily Republicans. They\u2019re just racists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe study revealed that when Trump voters were exposed to the \u201cblack cue,\u201d it not only made them less supportive of the issue. It made them angry. Yes, a picture of a black man\u2014not an actual black man, but a picture of a black man\u2014made them mad.\n\nMatthew Luttig, Christopher Frederico and Howard Lavine, the authors of the study, entitled \u201cSupporters and Opponents of Donald Trump Respond Differently to Racial Cues: An Experimental Analysis,\u201d wrote:\n\nWe find that white Trump supporters randomly exposed to a black (versus a white) man in the context of soliciting their support for a housing-assistance policy were more opposed to the policy, angrier about the policy, and more likely to blame beneficiaries for their situation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe study controlled for socioeconomic status and education and found no statistical difference between white and black Hillary Clinton supporters when they were exposed to racial cues. The study did not include data about black Trump supporters because Omarosa and Ben Carson were kinda busy.\n\n\n\nEven though there are some who say, \u201cJust because they voted for Trump and hate seeing black people doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re racist\u201d (did I mention that it was a picture? A picture, son!), numerous polls and studies have shown this before. There\u2019s the 2016 poll showing that when white people were told that America\u2019s white population would soon be eclipsed by nonwhites, they became more likely to support Donald Trump.\n\nThen there was the study that linked whites\u2019 perception of our need to get \u201ctough on crime\u201d to racial resentment. And that other research that linked the government\u2019s need to fix structural inequality to racial resentment. Don\u2019t forget the Pew Research Center\u2019s data showing that most Republicans oppose Black Lives Matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo when you see someone driving on the freeway on-ramp with a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d bumper sticker on their car, feel free not to let them merge into traffic, because they might be triggered by a picture of you (wait\u2014let me make sure I included the part about a picture ...

But should they do everything? I\u2019ve compiled a short list of things that, while white guys feel totally comfortable doing, maybe they should let someone else try or just stop doing altogether.\n\nNeedlessly abbreviate words.\n\nNot too long ago, I was talking to a white colleague about referring someone for a potential job opening and my Caucasian homey said, \u201cYou should definitely consider her. She\u2019s a total natch for the role.\u201d\n\nHuh? The fuck is a \u201cnatch,\u201d bruh and should we be referring to women like that, you know, like in the workplace, like right now and shit?\n\nThen he was like, \u201cNoooo, noooo, man. I mean that she\u2019s a real natural fit for the job.\u201d Which then reminded me that white dudes always find a way to abbreviate words for no fucking reason.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t seen you in a while man, how was the vacay?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re headed to Shake Shack to grab some burgs, dude.

I\u2019m fluent as shit in slang, but I\u2019m fuck-all in abbreviations.\n\nSuggest places to purchase electronics.\n\nDid you know that white men go to stores where they don\u2019t know anybody that works there and pay full price for electronic items that come in sealed boxes?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrazy, right?\n\nI told one of my white compadres that I was looking for a new TV so he recommended a spot. When I asked him who I need to look for (because, you know, *wink wink*, gonna get that hook-up) he just stared at me. Then I remembered that white dudes make more money than everyone else and he could actually afford the shit I\u2019m breaking my own bank to front to get. Then I called my homie and two days later I picked up my new TV in the parking lot beside a Costco.\n\nOrder shots for the table.\n\nIt always starts the same way. You\u2019re out with your white friends having a few drinks, maybe watching the game, or doing something else alcoholically benign when the server brings over a tray of Jameson shots and then Ryan from Account Services does that dumb ass shrug while saying, \u201cUh oh, looks like it\u2019s a round of Jamo for the crew!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you thought this was just a benevolent gesture of friendship, you thought wrong. As soon as you accept that first shot, you\u2019re agreeing to take a trip down the road to white boy wasted that only ends with you sitting at your desk the next morning wearing Ray Bans indoors, guzzling a Pedialyte, and trying to ignore Ryan when he says, \u201cHey brah, I\u2019m sorry if things got a little crazy last night. I\u2019ll buy you a new phone.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd all you can do is shake your head as you pick glitter out of your beard.\n\n\n\nCarry guns.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not saying that white men are more prone to violence or have some natural inclination to shoot people. What I am saying is that I\u2019m not clear on what the parameters are for getting shot by a white guy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHear me out. When it comes to black people shooting black people, I have a firm understanding of how, why, and when I might get that iron pulled on me:\n\n-Selling dope in the wrong neighborhood.\n\n-Owing the wrong muthafucka some money.\n\n-Snitching.\n\n-Escalated disrespect in a public setting.\n\nAll those can and will get you shot by another black person. But with white guys, they just kinda shoot everyone, sometimes en masse, and usually no one knows why. I think we need to have a moratorium of firearms sales to white men until they can draft a clear memo detailing their shooting protocol (other than the cops just shooting black folks \u2018cause they can) so that people know what parts of town are clear and shit.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite people always want to ask me if my neighborhood is safe to visit at night, I feel like I\u2019m owed the same courtesy.\n\nBe in charge of like, everything.\n\nIt goes without saying that, after about a 600 year or so run, white guys have had a pretty good go of the whole Eurocentric patriarchic power structure thing. And while I\u2019m sure that they\u2019d point to history as precedent as to why white men seem to be in charge of everything, have they ever asked themselves a.) why they seem to be in charge of everything and, b.) should they reasonably be in charge of everything?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the recent release of Michael Wolff\u2019s Fire and Fury and the unflattering portrait it paints of the Trump Administration, I\u2019ve seen conservative (mostly white male) commentators alleging that the stories in the book must be fabrications or exaggerations. And of course, they would. In their minds, they probably see an assembly of seemingly successful white dudes in their rightful seat of power where they (by virtue of their whiteness and maleness) shouldn\u2019t have any problems because they project success onto other white men. Ineptitude or incompetence or plain ol\u2019 stupidity aren\u2019t traits that they\u2019ve been conditioned to see in themselves (those are for the women and the coloreds) so why would they see them in their peers?\n\nThis feeds the broader point. Maybe, just maybe, being a white man isn\u2019t enough. Maybe, the Trump Administration\u2019s flaws are indicative of a larger logical fallacy that we\u2019ve fallen into and perhaps other dominions of white male supremacy are just as fucked up. Banks? Higher education? Corporate America? Perhaps they\u2019re all inhabited by a bunch of mediocre white guys who keep getting the benefit of the doubt because success has been projected upon them by their peers.\n\n\n\nJuxtapose this with Sunday night\u2019s Golden Globes, where the spirit of unanimity and solidarity for inclusion and equality for women and minorities was on display beyond a mere act of sartorial activism. The Time\u2019s Up movement\u2019s presence in conjunction with Oprah Winfrey\u2019s clarion speech extolling viewers to focus on the horizon ahead stand in stark contrast with the #MAGA crowd and their insistence on perpetuating the fantasy of the patriarchal status quo. Or, simply stated, Auntie Oprah speaks for the America that, in spite of itself, could be. Diverse in its leadership, empathetic in its promise, and equitable in the distribution of its justice. Trump and his followers speak for an America that never was and will never be. But success is not zero sum; in order for others to gain, it\u2019s not as if white men have to lose.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs we stand at the fulcrum between Oprah\u2019s optimism and Trump\u2019s Trumpism, we all have to ask ourselves how long we can be denied our own equitable seats at the table for the sake of giving in to an antiquated norm. The evidence shows that, try as they might, we can\u2019t just let the white guys do it all by themselves. Hell, perhaps they created systems of discrimination and oppression because they knew that all along and hoped we\u2019d never find out.\n\n\n\nToo late.", "keywords": ["black", "charge", "probably", "wrong", "im", "things", "maybe", "stop", "white", "saying", "know", "letting", "guys", "men"], "polarity": -0.0051354953897326805, "subjectivity": 0.409657868026512},

The city she lived in and schools she attended were mostly white. But when she moved to Campinas, a city of 1 million approximately two hours outside of Sao Paulo, she decided to be proactive.\n\n\u201cI wanted to increase my connection to Afro-Brazilian people,\u201d she says.\n\nThaisa joined Afrodengo, an Afro-Brazilian dating community on Facebook. When she finally got up the nerve to post her photo and introduced herself\u2014a requirement of the community\u2014she noticed that one guy who \u201cliked\u201d her photo lived in her city. His name was Jackson Xavier.\n\nShe reached out to him on Facebook and they immediately started talking. Two days later, they went out on their first date. She instantly liked his intelligence, responsibility and the way he cared for her. He liked her stubbornness, humor and intelligence as well. Five months later, the couple were married. As Jackson explains:\n\nBefore the group, I didn\u2019t even think to look for relationships with black women, and I had never had a black girlfriend. But once I entered the group, I started to focus more on having a relationship with a black person like me because we have similar experiences. The black movement is very strong on the internet, so I entered the group wanting to see more beautiful black people and to have references in my life to black things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfrodengo was created one year ago by Afro-Brazilian journalist and single mother Lorena If\u00e9, 29, to promote love and marriage among Afro-Brazilians. \u201cDengo\u201d is a word with African roots that Brazilians\u2014especially Afro-Brazilians\u2014call people to show love and care. Despite the country\u2019s African origins, hundreds of years of slavery and European colonialism have made affection and stable relationships between black women and black men in Brazil unique and unusual.\n\nNow Afro-Brazilians are flocking to the Afrodengo Facebook group to build relationships that they never before considered having. But If\u00e9 not only wants to spark love among Afro-Brazilians; she also wants to help them build relationships with one another so that they can combat racism in Brazil. She explains:\n\nHaving relationships between black people is a way to combat racism. Only a black person will know how racism affects you and its consequences in our lives. In a society where we learn to hate ourselves, if we unite with people like us, then we can combat racism with something as simple as having a conscious family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo jump-start the group, If\u00e9 invited Afro-Brazilian men and women to post photos and descriptions of themselves. Within a week, it exploded\u2014with both members and photos. At one point, If\u00e9 had more than 10,000 people waiting to be approved to the group. If\u00e9 created an environment where every type of black person, regardless of sexuality, sex, religion or political viewpoint, is welcome.\n\nToday the group is still going strong; having produced at least two marriages and countless couples and friendships. There are more than 100,000 members in the main group and its affiliates (which focus on LGBT members, Christians and body positivity). If\u00e9 plans to turn the Facebook group into an app.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Afro-Brazilians enjoy the group, some white Brazilians consider If\u00e9 and the group racist because it is exclusively for black people. For African Americans, a dating site for black people seems obvious. But for Brazilians, communities restricted by race are always frowned upon. White Brazilians also want to be a part of the group.\n\n\u201cTo this day, I have to deny entrance to white people who want to join the group,\u201d If\u00e9 said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe creation of Afrodengo stems from If\u00e9\u2019s personal experiences pursuing amor afrocentrado\u2014\u201dblack love\u201d\u2014 in Salvador, Brazil. While in a relationship with her son\u2019s father, she felt that their relationship lacked the affection she sees given to white women in Brazil. Soon after they broke up, she tried her hand at online dating and even created a profile on Tinder. But although she lives in a city that is more than 80 percent black, she couldn\u2019t find any black men on the platform.\n\nIf\u00e9 says she wasn\u2019t raised with affection\u2014which is common among poor Afro-Brazilians simply trying to survive. Personally, she longs for a black man who will cherish her intelligence and give her affection when she wants\u2014even when she doesn\u2019t need it. She still longs for an \u201cAfrodengo.\u201d\n\nCreating this Afrodengo [was] a way to help me survive and help others going through a similar situation. It helped me to move on from my relationship and survive my depression.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf\u00e9\u2019s struggle is one that many black women in Brazil share. Many of their lives are marked by loneliness (solid\u00e3o da Mulher Negra) because they aren\u2019t chosen\u2014the chosen women being white women. In Brazil, black and mixed-race women have been traditionally oversexualized or looked upon as domestic servants, while white women are viewed as the perfect women to give affection to and to have a healthy marriage with. It is a given that the more money and education an Afro-Brazilian has, the more likely he will marry a white woman.\n\nTranslating from a YouTube video by anthropologist Ana Cl\u00e1udia Pacheco, a professor at the State University of Bahia:\n\nBecause of historical reasons related to racism, many black women in Brazil suffer from solitude. ... Our choices in who we give affection to and who we choose as a partner are still regulated by and structured by racism and sexism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Afrodengo isn\u2019t just for creating romantic relationships; Afro-Brazilian men and women are using the group to strengthen their black identity and create friendships with Afro-Brazilians across Brazil. Says early adopter Gabriel Rangel, 25, from Rio de Janeiro:\n\nI still haven\u2019t found a relationship through Afrodengo, but now I have friends all over the country, and the group has really opened my mind to the Black Movement in Brazil.\n\nMember Lais Mello entered the group one week after it launched. Adopted by a white family, she\u2019d lacked a strong connection to Afro-Brazilian culture. She created the first city-specific WhatsApp group for Afrodengo, which helped her organize meetups in Salvador and make friends with Afro-Brazilians close to her town in Bahia. Now Mello is a moderator of the group, and credits Afrodengo with increasing her self-esteem and pulling her out of depression:\n\nBefore Afrodengo, I wouldn\u2019t leave the house because of my depression and anxiety. My self-esteem was so low. But now I love going to Afrodengo meetups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf\u00e9 has grand plans for the Afrodengo brand. The first thing she wants to do is get off of Facebook and create an app for the group. She\u2019s currently looking for funding and support, and plans to apply to the Vale de Dend\u00ea accelerator, which is targeting Afro-Brazilian startups based in Salvador.", "keywords": ["afrobrazilian", "black", "love", "style", "easier", "group", "afrobrazilians", "afrodengo", "brazil", "white", "if\u00e9", "relationships", "women", "making"], "polarity": 0.10571208112874778, "subjectivity": 0.43239417989417983},

And quite frankly, I\u2019m tired of laying my favorite brands down because the dumb folks in corporate communications elected to take a college course on the importance of Star Wars instead of African-American history.\n\n\n\nSo in an effort to prevent us all from giving up any more good body washes, hair products and cereals, I\u2019ve put together this list of Black Twitter-wrath-proof marketing practices for all those in need.\n\n1. Lay Down Our Edges\n\nThis one is pretty un-fuck-with-able. Forget the wardrobe and accessories\u2014what\u2019s sis\u2019 edges looking like? If a toothbrush wasn\u2019t involved in the making of the hairstyle, go back and try again (please don\u2019t try to understand this logic; just go with it). If a proper gel or styling agent cannot be located, be sure to check with the model. Nine times out of 10, she knew y\u2019all would get it wrong and likely has all necessary styling equipment in her bag, and/or has a homegirl around the corner who can be there in 15 minutes.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Racism Cannot Be Cured With a Kardashian\n\nI\u2019m sure the bronzer, large number of black men, enlarged lips, cornrows and build-a-booties would lead you to believe otherwise, but trust me on this one.\n\n\n\n3. All Models of Color Must Maintain Their Melanin Throughout the Making of the Advertisement\n\nIt\u2019s never a good look if a model or actor has to set aside his or her blackness for the sake of selling a product. FYI, I wasn\u2019t speaking figuratively; I said what I said. If your model must remove, lighten or disrobe their skin, you\u2019re probably going down the wrong creative path. Yes, Michael Jackson made it work for the \u201cBlack or White\u201d video, but you ain\u2019t Michael, and you dang sure ain\u2019t Tyra Banks killing \u2019em with your shoulders alongside the King of Pop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Don\u2019t Exclude Us\n\nI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re selling pumpkin-spice lattes with a side of cottage cheese out of the back of a Volkswagen Beetle at a Taylor Swift concert; somewhere, somehow, there\u2019s a black person who may be into it. In many ways, we\u2019re just like you, so don\u2019t leave us out. The last thing you want us to do is play a round of \u201cFind the Negro\u201d on your ad. It won\u2019t end well.\n\n5. Along Those Same Lines, Don\u2019t Assume We\u2019re Monolithic\n\nSo, you know how some white people like the color blue, while others prefer purple or yellow or orange? Well, it\u2019s exactly the same with black people. What works for some of us may not work for others (case in point: the age-old debate of grits vs. Cream of Wheat). One size does not fit all, and one marketing tactic does not work for the masses\u2014unless, of course, you\u2019re Beyonc\u00e9, for every living being shall get into formation accordingly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Don\u2019t Try to Be Us\n\nWhen marketing to or for a black person, it\u2019s always preferred that you use an actual black person. Aesthetically, it\u2019s a lot more pleasing.\n\n7. We Give No Cares About Your Apology\n\nThe damage is done. The racism has been distributed widely across multiple platforms and we screenshot the hell out of it, so who cares what you have to say after the fact? I\u2019m sure most brands don\u2019t intentionally sit down and say, \u201cHow can we eff with the most historically disenfranchised and oppressed group of people of all time?\u201d But unfortunately that doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s impact vs. intent, and the former overshadows the latter. If you have to apologize, consider issuing an apology in the form of more diverse hires and inclusive marketing practices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. When All Else Fails, Just Use the Honey Bunches of Oats Lady or Michelle Obama\n\nWe love the ish out of both of these women and would never question their judgment or discernment. If you\u2019ve got a friend in them, you\u2019ve got a friend in us.\n\n", "keywords": ["mind", "sure", "black", "marketing", "dont", "try", "things", "racism", "work", "person", "white", "youre", "companies"], "polarity": 0.05085418348130211, "subjectivity": 0.4227064837234329},

What the hosts of Catfish have taught everyone over the years is that Google Images search is your friend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a world of dating apps like Tinder, OkCupid and Match, there are tons of scams and catfishing going on. But nowadays, it\u2019s not hard to protect yourself from them. Even with an app like Tinder, a simple screenshot of a person\u2019s photo is all you need for a Google Images reverse search. And with websites like SpyDialer, a phone number search can sometimes yield results such as a person\u2019s first or last name.\n\nWith people adding personal information on apps that use Facebook to fill out their profile, if people have their college or job listed, a Facebook search of their first name or college or the company they work for is also another simple way to see if they\u2019re catfishing or real. It may be time-consuming if their first name is a common one, but eventually you\u2019re bound to come across their profile.\n\nIn the case of Greg Davis, he eventually realized that he was duped out of his life savings after asking for proof about the inheritance and being sent a video with his name on some fake-ass $100 bills.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t be a Greg Davis when it comes to dating sites and apps.

Since then, my hate has done nothing but grow and become hungrier, like a guy at Old Country Buffet who\u2019s hungry as shit but can\u2019t eat because the server hasn\u2019t given him clean silverware yet.\n\nAnd like most other hungry things\u2014and, well, most other things that need to stay alive\u2014it needs to be fed daily, and this is what I do to keep my hate healthy.\n\nAdvertisement", "keywords": ["jump", "hungry", "yetand", "alive", "carlson", "spotlight", "things", "articles", "yes", "right", "wroteincluding", "need", "white", "tucker", "20", "hate"], "polarity": -0.0388668430335097, "subjectivity": 0.4436507936507937},

It's impossible to answer.

Which means they will continue to exist. Despite my frustration at this annoying new genre of MAGA fanfic, I admit to possessing a perverse fascination with these people, and I know I'm not alone.\n\nTake \"In Trump Country, Shock at Trump Budget Cuts, but Still Loyalty\" for instance, where Nicholas Kristof of the NY Times interviews men and women who will be hurt and perhaps even killed by Trump's proposed budget cuts.\n\nGawk at the follow passage, and tell me how you can read it and not be completely spellbound by it.\n\n\n\nJudy Banks, a 70-year-old struggling to get by, said she voted for Trump because \u201che was talking about getting rid of those illegals.\u201d But Banks now finds herself shocked that he also has his sights on funds for the Labor Department\u2019s Senior Community Service Employment Program, which is her lifeline. It pays senior citizens a minimum wage to hold public service jobs. \u201cThis program makes sense,\u201d said Banks, who was placed by the program into a job as a receptionist for a senior nutrition program. Banks said she depends on the job to make ends meet, and for an excuse to get out of the house. \"If I lose this job,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ll sit home and die.\u201d Yet she said she might still vote for Trump in 2020\n\nIf Trump does what he says he's going to do, she knows she'll have nothing to live for and might even die. But she still would vote for him \u2014 even if that vote came from the fucking grave. Keeping \"those illegals\" out and retaining the value of Whiteness in America is so important to her that she'd choose that over her own life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd perhaps quotes like that articulate the true value of these endless and mind-numbing profiles. It's not for us to be sympathetic to them, or to determine how to reach them, but for us to finally collectively realize that they just can't be reached. That we're operating with different currencies, and concepts like \"logic\" and \"literally saving your own fucking ass\" are valueless to them. That they'd rather see us gone or dead (or both) than themselves alive.\n\nSo yes, let's continue to read about and study them.

Like, I\u2019m sure we all could go on and on about how terrible this year truly was to each and every last one of us. Still, the year had some high points, which we pointed out earlier this week, but in the spirit of balance and equilibrium (it took me all that I had to not make a Star Wars crack, since I finally went to go see The Last Jedi), I think reflection on the super, terrible year that was 2017 is necessary, even if that means reflecting on its low points for us as a people.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nSo, without further ado, I present to you the top 10 disappointing moments (in no particular order) black people experienced in the year 2017:\n\n\n\n1. White People\n\nThis ... is a given. In 2017, perhaps the greatest moments of discomfort, borderline instability and downright asininity experienced by our large and expansive community could be most certainly traced back to Chet and them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom President Cheeto Dandruff yucking it up in the White House and threatening to start a war every time he tweeted with his sausage fingers to white people trying to install a whole (alleged) child molester in another political office in Alabama to chanting about \u201cwhite lives\u201d in Charlottesville, Va., with their busted tiki torches, white folx showed no sign of waking the fuck up and instead continued to plead that we save them from themselves.\n\n2. The Atlanta Falcons Giving Up a 25-Point Lead in the Super Bowl\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Jan. 22, 2017, it was announced that the Atlanta Falcons would face off against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl 51. And after President Radioactive Cheeto Dust was elected to office at the conclusion of 2016, it became quite clear that this aforementioned game was about to become an unintentional, extended metaphor for that year.\n\nIndeed, it was the ultrablack, ultralit Falcons versus Trump\u2019s America the New England Patriots and Tom \u201cTrump Is My Boi\u201d Brady. And for a minute, during that very game, it looked as if the Falcons were gonna take the win, with a 25-point lead to boot.\n\n... and then they blew that lead to lose to Trump\u2019s America the Patriots by six points.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was one of the most embarrassing Ls we took this year, and to be quite honest, I\u2019ll never get over it.\n\n3. The Cancellation of Underground\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am honestly still too angry to describe how unjust it was that Underground was canceled but shows like, oh, I don\u2019t know, Megyn Kelly Today are still chilling on the air.\n\nIt was an unnecessary loss of a show that focused on aspects of black liberation during slavery rather than the kind of torture porn that Hollywood is used to peddling. The cancellation was especially hard to swallow when it was announced that HBO had its own alternate-universe slavery fan fiction in development (thankfully, that looks like it\u2019s no longer happening).\n\nHowever, despite its unjust cancellation, the search for a new home network for Underground continues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Alexandra Shipp, Tinashe and Colorism\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColorism. It is a subset of oppression that precedes your existence and mine. And yet, to this day, black people can\u2019t seem to get ourselves together when it comes to this topic. Such was the case this year as well.\n\nTinashe was the earliest example as she implied that being light-skinned had hurt her odds of succeeding in the music industry, even though she had not done anything remarkable as of late, and she simultaneously failed to call out the over-saturation of stars who look like her in the business, thereby causing her lamentations to fall on deaf ears.\n\nAlexandra Shipp was just another example of this when, a couple of weeks ago, the actress claimed that black people had been the most racist to her for her entire life. This was after a Storm superfan came into her Twitter mentions about hoping that Marvel would cast a dark-skinned Storm for a hypothetical X-Men franchise reboot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot everyone agreed with how the fan approached the ever present problem of characters like Storm being portrayed by light-skinned actresses, but I think most of us can agree that the actress (a word I use lightly) took the conversation in a direction that didn\u2019t even make any damn sense.\n\nAnd in 2017, we should be able to do better.\n\n5. Russell Simmons Proved How Tight Sexual Predators Can Be\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2017 was a shit year, no doubt, but it also proved to be, for the most part, a year of reckoning for men who had done some dirt in the dark. The domino effect started with Harvey Weinstein, and folks are still out here in these streets being rightfully exposed. And Russell Simmons was among those in the carnage.\n\nAfter Terry Crews came forward about being sexually assaulted by WME\u2019s Adam Venit (a moment that was very, very important for male survivors), Crews also was very candid about the folx who had tried to silence him and, in turn, exposed Simmons\u2019 damning email to Crews in which he attempted to tell Crews to \u201clet it go.\u201d It was a disgusting development, and no one was surprised when Simmons was subsequently accused of sexual assault, too. However, folx who were familiar with Simmons\u2019 Rush Card scams and Kimora Lee\u2019s stories about him knew that this was part of an already trifling pattern of behavior.\n\n6. The Fallout from VerySmartBrothas\u2019 \u201cStraight Black Men Are the White People of Black People\u201d Piece\n\nThe moment I saw the headline \u201cStraight Black Men Are the White People of Black People\u201d come across my timeline, I knew that all hell was about to break loose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nI\u2019m not gonna get into the specifics of the piece (mostly because you can read it here), but Damon Young\u2019s article got at a point that cisgender straight men had been ignoring for a long time: that they are the most privileged in our community.\n\nOf course, it wasn\u2019t as easy to refute coming from a fellow cis, straight black man, so many of Young\u2019s detractors, in turn, went after prominent black women who had shared the article\u2014the chief example being Jemele Hill, who they had all fake supported weeks prior. It was an ever present example of the kind of hypocritical bullshit black women are confronted with every damn day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Time: The Kalief Browder Story Reminds Us of Everyone We\u2019ve Lost to an Unjust Justice System\n\nOn Oct. 6, 2016, it was announced that Jay-Z and his team were putting together a documentary about the life, times, and completely unnecessary and avoidable death of Kalief Browder. The documentary finally debuted this year, and while it was something we sorely needed, it was also a painful reminder of all the black people we had lost thus far to an unjust \u201cjustice system.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt also served as a harrowing admonisher of the effects that racism and white supremacy can have on our bodies and minds, too, which we were reminded of after his mother\u2019s (Venida Browder) untimely death last year and Erica Garner\u2019s recent hospitalization.\n\n8. Black Transgender Model Munroe Bergdorf Called Out Racism and Was Fired by L\u2019Oreal\n\nIn a year full of watershed moments when women snatched back the mic from a society that constantly seeks to silence us, it was particularly angering when Munroe Bergdorf did just that and was punished for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, L\u2019Oreal was all for profiting off her image as a black trans woman and her ties to those respective communities, but as soon as she attempted to speak on behalf of them, L\u2019Oreal was like, \u201cNah.\u201d Combine this with instances like Jemele Hill\u2019s, and it\u2019s another example of these corporations wanting \u201cdiversity\u201d without teeth. Performative nonsense.\n\n9. That Racist Dove Commercial\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s be real. Since the goal of any sensible corporation or business is to make a boatload of cold, hard, stinking cash (hello, capitalism), no one is expecting them to be super-\u201cwoke,\u201d empathetic entities.\n\nHowever.\n\nIn the spirit of getting as much money as fucking possible, you would think they could at least appeal to the most common denominator of their demographics and have people on deck to make sure they are not racially insulting a huge chunk of their base.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019d think.\n\nBut this year, that was not the case with Dove. Dove made it excruciatingly obvious that it has no black people in its public relations/marketing department when it released a commercial that showed a dark-skinned black woman taking off a brown shirt and morphing into a white woman.\n\nTo be forthcoming, it wasn\u2019t the only beauty company with a racist ad this year. Nivea joined in on the fun by putting out its \u201cWhite Is Purity\u201d ad and got the social media flogging it deserved. Yet Dove\u2019s ad happened to be a bit more biting because black people are a huge piece of its base and because there\u2019s something very visceral about seeing a black woman morphing into a white woman in an ad that is not Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cBlack or White\u201d video\u2014especially considering the history of racist soap advertisements in America and abroad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. Dave Chappelle\u2019s Return\n\n\n\nIn March 2017, after years of being off the air and mostly out of the limelight, Dave Chappelle prepared for what looked to be a roaringly victorious return to television.\n\nThis was something black folx had been anticipating and cheering on for a long time. After watching Chappelle walk away from a $50 million contract and refuse to be Comedy Central\u2019s dancing monkey (and thereby get branded \u201cunstable\u201d because of it), we were all excited for him to stick it to the man and make a glorious comeback via Netflix.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd he surely did return, but it wasn\u2019t the unanimous victory some of us were hoping for.\n\n\n\nWith his Netflix specials, it was clear that Chappelle had not lost his sharp comedic edge and that he was still 100 percent on point about the subtleties and not-so-subtleties of white supremacy and how its food chain works (e.g., \u201cWhite women not liking their cut\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it was also very clear that Chappelle may not have completely crossed over into 2017 with the rest of us. This was particularly the case with his Bill Cosby-heavy rape jokes (e.g., \u201cHe rapes but he saves!\u201d), and his weirdly obsessive jokes at the expense of queer and trans folx.\n\nIt was fairly disappointing, to say the least, to see someone willing to push the envelope in one area of oppression (racism) and willfully refusing to adapt to the times in other areas (homophobia and transphobia).\n\nI didn\u2019t know it then, but it was surely gonna be an omen of what was to come in 2017: that killing our darlings and letting down our idols was going to be oh so necessary ... as there was absolutely no guarantee that they were going to grow and change with us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd what an omen it was.", "keywords": ["simmons", "black", "2017", "experienced", "moments", "example", "disappointing", "white", "unjust", "woman", "women", "racist", "straight"], "polarity": 0.04550587067253737, "subjectivity": 0.4992853288686623},

What if every time you heard something you didn\u2019t like, you could punch the person who said it in the mouth? Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to be able to say anything you wanted\u2014even if it\u2019s a lie\u2014and have it manifest itself into reality?\n\nYou might be too civilized to pull down your pants, squat and drop a hot, steamy deuce whenever you got the bubble guts, but I bet it would be liberating. But of course there\u2019s no one privileged enough, with the perfect combination of oblivious self-confidence, low intelligence and pettiness, to do whatever he desires whenever he wants to.\n\nExcept Donald Trump.\n\nSince Trump hurdled the lowest bar possible by giving an adequately coherent speech to the joint session of Congress, it has been downhill ever since. The day after what many are calling \u201cThe Wipey Pole Address,\u201d the New York Times reported that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had been in bed under the covers and on the phone every night with the Russian ambassador, whispering in his sexy voice, with slow jams playing in the background, and lied to the Senate about it.\n\nA few minutes later, the Washington Post revealed that other Trump campaign surrogates also met with Russian officials. Throwing old fish grease on this dumpster fire of dumbasses, Trump woke up the next morning and tweeted that Barack Obama was personally snitching on him to the feds.\n\nHow low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017\n\nTo put it mildly, last week was more than a shitstorm for the Trump administration. It was a turd tornado; a cyclone of dookey. Between Trump accusing a former president of a felony, the new travel ban executive order and the Obamacare-repeal bill that Congress scrawled on a napkin minutes before the press conference, the past seven days have been everything we feared about a Trump presidency and more.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut apparently that\u2019s OK.\n\nWhile the mainstream media screams foul and people who pay attention are in the fetal position with thumbs in their mouths praying to dark-skinned, do-rag Jesus to keep us safe during the upcoming Trumpocalypse, apparently white America is nonplussed. Even though his approval ratings are historically low for a new president, we have previously cataloged how Captain Comb-Over\u2019s base of undereducated white voters keeps him with a relatively high approval rating.\n\nTuesday\u2019s USA Today/Suffolk University poll shows Trump with a 47 percent approval rating, while Rassmussen\u2019s daily tracking poll has him at 49 percent among likely voters. If Trump ran tomorrow, he\u2019d win, because 49 percent has been enough to win any presidential election in the last 20 years. To put that in context, President Obama\u2019s approval rating averaged 47.9 percent during his time in office. Among his Republican base, Trump still enjoys a relatively high approval rating of 82 percent as of Friday morning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what could the Pumpkin Pol Pot do to garner the disapproval of his legion of TrumpPets? Although there isn\u2019t much, we found five distinct things Trump could do that might possibly convince his constituency that he is a bad president.\n\n1. Stomp a puppy to death on the third hour of the Today show. Kathy Lee and Hoda probably wouldn\u2019t put down their wine glasses, but it would make for great television. Y.P. Pull can see refugees burst into flames from American bombs without batting an eye, or eat ice cream while watching the less fortunate lose their health care and disintegrate into a pile of festering boils on the floors of emergency rooms. But they love their pets.\n\nIt couldn\u2019t be just any puppy. If he hurt a black dog, his acolytes would probably say that the dog was reaching for a gun hidden in its collar or ask why everyone was so upset when dog-on-dog crime is at an all-time high. If he kicked a cat, they might say the feline deserved it, pointing at the hordes of feral cats roaming the Chicago streets. It would have to be a fluffy white poodle or a purebred Persian.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Dishonor the sanctity and honor of the great white race. If Trump admitted, one time, that racism exists or that some white people might be a tiny bit prejudiced, this country would spiral into a vomit-filled snot cry because white people are catching hell in Trump\u2019s America\u2014hence the \u201csilent majority.\u201d Apparently white people have been enduring so much suffering these past few years, and no one even paid attention.\n\nEven though whites who drop out of high school earn more than blacks with bachelor\u2019s degrees, have a lower unemployment rate and get better schools, the oppressed white man is knotted up in a corner somewhere wondering when he\u2019ll get his country back. If Trump called a school shooter a \u201cradical Christian terrorist\u201d or even insinuated that there was the possibility of the existence of this thing called \u201cwhite privilege,\u201d his approval would drop faster than Nicki Minaj at a Remy Ma concert.\n\n3. Forget why Aryan CrossFit Jesus died on the cross. There is only one thing white America loves more than pets, mayonnaise and flip-flops: firearms.\n\n\n\nThere is an entire hidden section in the white version of the Bible between the Old Testament and the New Testament that speaks about how blond, blue-eyed Jesus (who is always ripped in the paintings) came down from the cross on Mount Calvary and handed his people the Second Amendment. It is a sacred thing, no matter how many children, soldiers, innocent adults or (especially) people of color are riddled with bullets. God wanted us to stay strapped, and Trump better not mess with the almighty\u2019s decree.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Throw a baby into a paper shredder. Republicans love babies and will never stray away from their pro-life stance. By \u201cpro-life,\u201d though, we mean little, tiny, newborn entitled white babies. The sanctity of life doesn\u2019t extend into adulthood. (See the argument for guns above, or the study released this week that shows blacks are seven times more likely to be wrongly convicted of murder.) The \u201cEvery life is precious\u201d argument also excludes poor babies and black babies. According to TrumpPets, those infants don\u2019t deserve health care, welfare or oven food stamps. Trump could rip the limbs off a brown baby on live TV and feed the carcass to ravenous wolves, and white people would say, \u201cI wonder if fresh, dead babies will upset the puppies\u2019 stomachs?\u201d\n\n5. Tell the truth. Because if there is one thing white Americans fear, it\u2019s hearing the truth. They feel attacked when you point out the historical reality of inequality, oppression or statistical fact. They will refuse to believe anything that does not fit into their unmovable confirmation bias. Without evidence they will still believe that Hillary Clinton operates an underground sex ring in the basement of a pizza parlor, or illegal immigrants are casting ballots using the names of dead voters, but don\u2019t want to see Trump\u2019s tax records or hear about his insidious ties to Russia. If Trump told the truth, white America would ...\n\nOh, who are we kidding?

Maybe you dated one because you liked the way he called you \u201cking\u201d or \u201cqueen,\u201d before he chastised you for wearing your skirt too short, putting lye in your hair or\u2014and, no, I\u2019m not kidding about this\u2014getting so far away from your African roots that your body does unnatural, Eurocentric things like menstruate.\n\n\n\nPerhaps one of them called you a \u201cbed wench\u201d for refusing to go to see The Birth of a Nation, or maybe you just know someone who spent all his lotion money on copper ankhs and donations to Umar Johnson\u2019s mythical Hogwarts for black boys.\n\nThey are Hoteps.\n\nHoteps are people who have overdosed on \u201cPan-Afrikan\u201d ideologies they obtained by reading badly designed websites, Hidden Colors DVDs (yes, Hoteps still play DVDs) and poor-quality YouTube videos explaining Illuminati symbology to scary background music. Hotepness is unshakable because Hoteps don\u2019t read primary-sourced, peer-reviewed anything, and if you dispute any of their made-up dogma with actual facts, they can always dismiss it with, \u201cThat\u2019s what they want you to believe.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough they can be annoying, Hoteps pose no real danger to society, unless you have a loved one or family member ensnared in the Hotep world and you have to sit next to them at Thanksgiving.\n\nBut there is a new breed of Hotep growing larger and more powerful every day. We have ignored them for far too long, and now their underground community has grown into a global community that dominates politics and threatens to take over the entire world.\n\nThe white Hoteps.\n\nI call them TrumpPets.\n\nYes, when you take a closer look at the throng of the \u201calt-right,\u201d frustrated white \u201csilent majority,\u201d that makes up the base of Donald Trump supporters, you begin to see the parallels between Hotepery and the people who want to \u201cmake America great again.\u201d Let\u2019s take a look at their most similar characteristics:\n\n1. They love alternative facts.\n\nIf you sit down with Hoteps for a few minutes, they can explain Dr. Muyind\u00e8 Asibe\u2019s (or some other uncredentialed \u201cAfricanologist\u201d who studied with some of the greatest Hotep thinkers of our time) book that explains how there were no homosexuals in Africa and how we subsisted on the herbs of the earth, which is why our kids can\u2019t pay attention in school, and how we can cure herpes by burning sage and drinking a special herbal tea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDid I mention the menstruation thing?\n\nMeanwhile, the \u201cracialists\u201d who support Trump believe that immigrants are streaming over the border to simultaneously steal the white man\u2019s jobs and drain the country by living off welfare. If you told them that more Mexicans have left the U.S. than have come here since 2009, they wouldn\u2019t believe you. If you told them that young white males are the largest unseen terrorist group in America, they\u2019d think you were a liar because they know in their hearts that Muslims are secretly planning to kill them and institute Shariah law.\n\nA full 67 percent of Trump voters think that unemployment increased during the Obama years, and 84 percent of Republicans believe voter fraud regularly occurs\u2014although there is no evidence to support it. They absolutely hate Obamacare, but they are cool with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. They love their continent.\n\nMost people love their homeland. German people love Germany, and the Irish love Ireland. But Hoteps love Africa. The entire continent. They don\u2019t love the country or area from which their ancestors hail. They don\u2019t even love their specific tribe. All their facts come from stuff they learned about ancient Egypt, but it\u2019s all \u201cAfrican\u201d to them (also, please don\u2019t call it \u201cEgypt\u201d or \u201cAfrica\u201d\u2014it\u2019s \u201cKemet\u201d ... unless you meet a level 10 Hotep; then you have to take the vowels out and call it \u201cKMT\u201d). They love everything from Libya to Namibia\u2014it\u2019s all the same to them. If you tried to explain to them the logic of a Mexican loving Canada, they wouldn\u2019t listen, and you know why:\n\nBecause that\u2019s what they want you to think.\n\nLikewise, neo-Nazis believe the same thing about European culture. If you dare visit any white supremacist website, you will learn that everything good that exists in the world comes from Western civilization. According to them, the entire world\u2014especially people of color\u2014owes white people a debt of gratitude for civilizing the world, and inventing societies and economies and every positive force in history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDie-hard Trump supporter Rep. Steven King (R-Iowa) even said during an interview on live TV during the Republican National Convention:\n\nSteve King: I\u2019d ask you to go back through history and figure out, where are these contributions that have been made by these other categories of people that you\u2019re talking about, where did any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization?\u201d MSNBC host Chris Hayes: Than white people? SK: Than, than Western civilization itself. It\u2019s rooted in Western Europe, Eastern Europe and the United States of America and every place where the footprint of Christianity settled the world. That\u2019s all of Western civilization.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. They love their \u201cqueens.\u201d\n\nThere are two steadfast rules in the commandments of Hotepery:\n\nYou must end every conversation with \u201cas\u00e9\u201d (pronounced \u201cah-shay\u201d). You must refer to all women as queens.\n\nBut the first course in Hotep community college is teaching their queens how to subjugate themselves. Queens don\u2019t wear tight jeans. Queens should learn how to cook and how to speak to their kings in soft, hushed tones. Most importantly, like all things based in patriarchy, queens must allow their kings to control their vaginas. They don\u2019t necessarily treat women like royalty, they just like the word. \u201cPeace, Queen\u201d just sounds better when a Hotep introduces himself after leaving his white girlfriend\u2019s house.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite nationalists don\u2019t have commandments. They just have the \u201c14 words,\u201d which are supposed to make up the most important sentence to all white people:\n\nWe must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.\n\nWhite nationalists are worried about \u201cwhite genocide\u201d\u2014the conspiracy theory that race-mixing and diversity will eventually eliminate the white race. It\u2019s one of the reasons this part of the conservative base is so anti-abortion. Its members believe they need to make as many white people as possible to keep up their population. And also Jesus. If you ask them why they are anti-birth control if they don\u2019t want women having abortions, they will cite their Christian values, but\u2014just like the Hoteps\u2014it comes down to one thing: the patriarchal need to control vaginas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. They support their charlatans.\n\nIf you\u2019re a charismatic public speaker but lack the comedic skills to do stand-up or poetry and don\u2019t want to preach, you should consider a career in the lucrative field of Hotep teaching. There are men, like the aforementioned Dr. Umar Johnson, who travel around the world bilking thousands of dollars out of well-meaning black people. You can invent an academic r\u00e9sum\u00e9 like he did, but it is not required. There are others on the Hotep speaking circuit who just \u201ctalk good.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Trump has no political experience. It turns out that his stellar academic record is made up, but he basically became president by going on a white Hotep tour\u2014gathering naive wypipo at rallies around the country. Even though we think the country is worried about our peach-faced president, it is actually quite the opposite. Republicans (the party of the TrumpPets) approve of the job he\u2019s doing by a whopping 83 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo the next time you see someone in a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap, you should know that that\u2019s the TrumpPet version of an African head wrap. Unlike Hoteps, their elbows and ankles don\u2019t get ashy, but like their bizarro-world cousins, they don\u2019t trust the establishment, facts or women. There are sure to be people (probably in the comments section below) who will dismiss this as an attack on people who are in tune with their culture. They will say this article unfairly paints people who voted for Trump as racist and people who support the \u201cPan-Afrikan\u201d movement as silly.\n\nBut that\u2019s just what they want you to believe.\n\nAs\u00e9.", "keywords": ["hotep", "thats", "trump", "dont", "believe", "love", "trumppets", "women", "white", "world", "hoteps"], "polarity": 0.09636873267825649, "subjectivity": 0.39279681958253393},

Have they been affected? Or can love truly conquer all? (Editor\u2019s note: The couples asked that only first names be used to maintain privacy.)\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s Politics Got to Do With It?\n\nRobin and Scott live in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area and have been married for nearly five years. It is the second marriage for both. She is black and had a culturally inclusive upbringing in Baltimore. He is white, Republican and grew up in rural Pennsylvania with little exposure to African Americans.

The arguments continued, and it was downhill from there.\u201d\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Scott supported Donald Trump and all that he stood for. The couple\u2019s arguments became so explosive that Robin unfollowed her husband on social media and slept in a second bedroom. \u201cI was not 100 percent sure we could come back from it,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThe hardest part is feeling my husband does not have my back.

Below are my clarified thoughts, expressed in an exclusive interview with myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, earlier this week you wrote a piece stating that you want Trump supporters to die.\n\nI did.\n\nWere you sincere with that assertion?\n\nThat's a very interesting and very stupid question. Basically, that question was Cam Newton's sartorial decisions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow so?\n\nWell, Donald Trump might receive 60 million or so votes next week. And I'm not Joseph Stalin or the guy who told Arby's to sell Smokehouse Pork Belly sandwiches. I do not want 60 million people to die.\n\nI'm also aware that there are many people voting for Trump out of party loyalty. And some out of hate for Hillary Clinton. And some who happen to be single-issue voters. And some whose antipathy for Washington is so deep that they'd vote for an empty bottle of Aquafina before a career politician. And some who actually may have been hurt financially by Obamacare. And some who just might be genuinely enthused by his tax and labor plans. And some who give two shits about the election, but just think it would be cool if the guy from Home Alone 2 was President.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo I believe they're making a myopic, terrible, reckless, and stupid as the fuck fucking decision with potentially catastrophic consequences? Yes! But do I want these people to die and shit? Nah. They can live. The world's a better place with Omarosa in it.\n\nYou don't want them to die, not even a little bit?\n\nNah.\n\nNot even a itsy bitsy teenie weenie bit of death?\n\nNope!\n\nBut\u2026?\n\nAs stated in the piece, my feelings are directed towards those fueled by bias and bigotry. The people whose support of Trump is directly tied to their hate for people who look like me and don't look like them. The people who see \"Make America Great Again\" and wish to transport the country back to a time when the rights of Blacks and women and homosexuals and people who didn't happen to be Christians were either limited or outright nonexistent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese people exist. There are a lot of these fucking people. And fuck those people.\n\nYou're not interested in any type of racial reconciliation or healing?\n\nWith people who hate me? Nah. I'm good. If they want to decide to stop hating on their own, great! I'll even save them some pretzels and grape juice if they want to come over. But reconciliation suggests that both parties need to work to come together. And I'm more interested in attending an all-Kappa game night than extending an olive branch to people who wish to see me drown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo basically, you don't care if those people die?\n\nIs it really that outrageous to say that you wouldn't mind if the people who want you dead \u2014 people who hate you for no other reason than the fact that your skin happens to be a bit browner than theirs \u2014 died before they made that happen?\n\nI guess it's not.\n\nExactly!", "keywords": ["trump", "die", "thoughts", "fueled", "admittedly", "look", "im", "really", "supporters", "week", "hillary", "nah", "alot", "piece", "hate"], "polarity": -0.052997055910191486, "subjectivity": 0.5491085186000438},

And I believe she's a fucking adult.\n\nBut this isn't why I'm voting for her.\n\nI'm voting for her because I do not want to live in an America where the type of people who'd fervently, dogmatically, and unconditionally support Trump \u2014 who exist so motivated by and permeated with hate and fear and loathing that they'd stand in formation behind Darth Cheeto \u2014 have a reason to be optimistic about their beliefs. I do not want these people to feel good or inspired. I do not want them to receive some type of collective psychic victory. I do not want them to experience any measure of positive reinforcement. No encouragement. No stir. No rousing. No influx of energy. No invigoration. No revitalization. No nothing besides confusion, shame, and, if the confusion and the shame isn't enough to convince them to at least consider not hating me and people who look like me and people who don't look like them, death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, you read that correctly. I want these motherfuckers to lose. And if losing what might be the last winnable election for them in a millennia isn't enough for them to move into the 21st century, I wouldn't terribly mind if they withered the fuck away and died.\n\nI'll even write them a card.

Trump\u2019s presidential bid has been quite clear: Take the themes of racism and nativism once popularized by George Wallace, add contemporary references and essentially tell the electorate, \u201cThis is the remix. The jeeps pump this new remix.\u201d\n\nFrom talks of a \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d to separate white people us from the purported \u201crapists\u201d known as immigrants from Mexico to his recent plans to put forth an ideological test for Muslim immigrants before entering the United States, the Republican nominee\u2019s ethos has long proved to be, more or less, \"Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.\"\n\nGiven that this is the party of the \u201cSouthern strategy,\u201d it makes sense\u2014no matter how loudly establishment Republicans cry to the contrary. And yet when it comes to categorizing Trump\u2019s supporters, some have continued to be reluctant to declare that they, like Trump, have political interests majorly motivated by bigotry.\n\nThe predominant narrative has been that what fuels support among Trump\u2019s claimed core base\u2014white working-class voters\u2014is economic anxiety, not prejudice. There have been other explanations given, too, including this notion that Trump the billionaire is \u201can image of their aspiration.\u201d\n\nThat may be true, to an extent, but select political writers have continued to belabor the point that these voters are \u201cbeing left behind, by the economy and by the culture.\u201d This line of categorization doesn\u2019t go nearly far enough to calling a thing by its name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, there have been reports out for months now arguing to the contrary\u2014highlighting that Trump supporters are better off economically compared with most Americans. A more recent and in-depth study has elaborated on that tidbit, piling on that for all of Trump\u2019s chatter about trade and immigration, most of his supporters have not been affected by that, thus making all framing of his voters that evades the role of racism read as disingenuous.\n\nEven a recent tweet by Vox related to the latter study reads, \u201cTrump's base is not poor whites\u2014it's way more complicated than that.\u201d Beloveds, is it truly that complicated? Racism is not complicated; calling out racism surely seems to be, though.\n\nIn \u201cDismissing Trump Fans As White Trash Gets Our Class System All Wrong,\u201d writer Nancy Isenberg argues, \u201cWhy are Americans so reluctant to talk about the real and enduring character of our class system?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a valid question, but not in the context of denoting why white Americans of every class support Trump\u2019s candidacy. Some have even penned essays like \u201cEven if You Don\u2019t Like Donald Trump, You Should Understand the Pain of His Poor White Supporters.\u201d Another one like it is titled, \u201cWhy \u2018White Trash\u2019 Americans Are Flocking to Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nNuance is typically a necessity, but in this instance, it\u2019s long been proved that poor white voters will vote against their economic interests. Likewise, we have known that suburban white women in the suburbs will do the same where applicable. The same goes for white men of any class.\n\nWhat do you think unites them? We could try a s\u00e9ance to contact Richard Nixon or Lee Atwater and ask either of them to please advise, but we needn\u2019t go back that far. The Grand Ol\u2019 Party has always hinted at it; Trump just amped the volume and skipped the pretenses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust this week, Amy Walter, national editor of the Cook Political Reporter and a frequent political commentator, tweeted this about Trump: \u201cTrump is right that voters want outsider/disruptor but his temperament\u2014not his message\u2014is the problem for them.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s message is rooted in xenophobia, racism, sexism and other party favors of white nationalism. How is that not a problem? That said, I also saw someone on MSNBC declare, moments after Trump, speaking before a white audience, told black people they were being duped by Democrats for decades, that we should commend him for reaching out to black audiences.\n\nI seem to have misplaced my gratitude, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s somewhere lost in the history of Trump\u2019s anti-black business practices and language over decades. Perhaps the punditocracy\u2019s ambivalence with this is unanimously tied to white people\u2019s collective anxiety over the term \"racism.\" So many act as if it\u2019s the second-worst word behind \u201cn\u2014ger\u201d while notably failing to understand that being called \u201cracist\u201d isn\u2019t the worst thing in the world; being subjected to racism is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump has not toed the line of racism; he has directly danced on it for decades on end. Racism is varied in every single way, and Donald J. Trump exploits it at every single level. He\u2019s not alone in that in politics, but he is the Republican presidential nominee and the most vocally racist presidential contender in decades.\n\nFor well over a year, amid his racism and xenophobia, we\u2019ve been subjected to a narrative about the core reasoning beyond those supporting his vision of America.\n\nNow we know it is a false one. With that comes the opportunity for those to call his supporters as racist as their candidate. Those who seize on that will be late as hell, but late is better than never.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Arceneaux hails from Houston, lives in Harlem and praises Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s name wherever he goes.

Not only are diehard Trump groupies less likely to like us (again, that we already know), but they also believe that we\u2019re less \u201cintelligent,\u201d downright \u201clazy,\u201d \u201cviolent\u201d and \u201ccriminal.\u201d No word on what prompted Reuters/Ipsos to conduct the poll in the first place.\n\nBut what\u2019s probably real news to most casual observers gleaning the racially convulsive poll is that it\u2019s not just Trump supporters who feel that way. On average, Reuters/Ipsos discovered a quarter or more of Hillary Clinton supporters\u2014yes, fellow Democrats\u2014sharing the same views.\n\nThe breakdown of numbers is both revealing and nauseating to the trained side eye of racism-weary people of color used to it by now. Extracted from more than 7,800 responses nationwide between March 21 and April 21 (as Republicans were wrapping up their primary), pollsters not only closely compared the racial perceptions of Trump and Clinton supporters but also threw in Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Gov. John Kasich (R-Ohio) voters in the bunch for good measure.\n\nOverall, among all those polled, 22.5 percent believe that blacks were less intelligent, along with about 26.8 percent, 31.1 percent, 32.8 percent and 33.2 percent who believe that black folks are lazier, less well-mannered, more violent and more unlawful (in comparison with their white peers), respectively.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf that\u2019s not enough to piss you off and angrily shake your head at the staring white co-workers whispering around the watercooler, perhaps it\u2018s the sense that this latest survey shows you getting hit from all political sides. Least expected, considering that African-American voters are largely steadfast Democratic Party loyalists during most elections, is to hear that a sizable chunk of Clinton supporters don\u2019t really dig us all that much. A good 21 percent of Clinton supporters think we\u2019re of low IQ, along with 24 percent who think we\u2019ve got bad a work ethic, and the 30 percent or more who (worse, yet) think we lack class, are more prone to beat them down and are engaged in all sorts of straight-to-jail behavior.\n\nStill, the overall cultural picture presented in this latest poll presents few surprises. It\u2019s no mystery that many whites harbor generally tasteless, jackass-level perceptions of black life despite much evidence to the contrary (and their guilt in systematically perpetuating anything that cements such views). A 2014 Journal of Social Psychological and Personality Science study entitled \u201cA Superhumanization Bias in Whites\u2019 Perceptions of Blacks\u201d found a majority of whites believing that blacks are mythically \u201csuperhuman\u201d and, therefore, numb to pain. (And yet Hollywood won\u2019t give us superhero roles. Unbelievable.)\n\nAn earlier Stanford study, deploying \u201creal-life tests,\u201d showed just a quarter of white participants supporting a ban of California\u2019s infamous three-strikes law, even after they saw how much it disproportionately hammered black men. Yes, the crates run very deep on this count; no need to rebuild the endless pit of archive that houses them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat might feel backstabbing to some, however, is that popular black political conversation typically associates that type of thinking with Republicans. With so much coalition-building, post-racial kumbaya narrative on the Democratic side, we\u2019re not usually aware of what white Democrats think. Added is a generally held assumption that 21st-century white Democrats are relatively harmless on the question of race: Even if their privilege occasionally leaks, so long as they\u2019re politically aligned when vote time comes up, it\u2019s all good. (\u201cHey, we\u2019re on the same team, right?\u201d)\n\nNot saying that Republicans are better \u2026 by any stretch. Obviously, just keep looking at the numbers in that Reuters/Ipsos poll as many reluctantly accept their orange-tinged nominee. Trump\u2019s folks, predictably, made a side-step statement in response to it. \"Mr. Trump is an egalitarian who believes in supporting and protecting all people equally,\" Trump Senior Policy Adviser Stephen Miller said. \"This is a stark contrast to Hillary Clinton, whose policies have been a disaster for African-American and Hispanic citizens.\"\n\nInterestingly enough\u2014or maybe not\u2014the Clinton campaign had no comment.\n\nBut what can you really say on the matter if you\u2019re an embattled presidential candidate who\u2019s going to need every bit of the electoral Skittles rainbow working in your favor Nov. 8? While Trump is banking on a white-voter turnout of 60 percent or more, Clinton needs a coalition of everyone\u2014especially enthusiastic black voters who don\u2019t think (as the Caribbean saying goes) they got a six after asking for a nine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProblem is that race\u2014more specifically, the eternal question of black people in America\u2014appears as a radioactive glue holding skin-color values together. Earlier this year, YouGov posed (pdf) similarly uncomfortable questions in another poll: Forty-five percent overall said that black people were \u201ctakers\u201d (compared with just 20 percent who called us \u201cgivers\u201d). No surprise that 65 percent of Republicans (and 50 percent of whites overall) described black folks as takers\u2014but, more curiously, a solid 32 percent of Democrats felt the same, along with 23 percent of \u201cliberal whites\u201d who viewed blacks as \u201cnet takers.\u201d In that poll, African Americans scored worse than every other racial group.\n\nYet, ironically, the white Democratic candidate will need the outgoing black Democratic president to win over \u2026 white voters. At least according to another recent YouGov poll. Just under 30 percent of whites who like President Barack Obama \u201care enthusiastic about Hillary Clinton,\u201d with many Bernie Sanders supporters more inclined to favor Obama than than they are Clinton.\n\nWhat\u2019s for certain is that we\u2019re not just faced with one of the toughest and most bizarre elections in recent history. We\u2019re also faced with, arguably, a presidential election much more racially charged than the last two. The outcome may hinge as much on how white people feel about black people as it does on voters simply supporting candidates based on qualifications. While polls on that question might not capture the full picture, the fact that pollsters are even asking it says a lot about what\u2019s on the horizon\u2014and how much we\u2019ll have to watch our collective backs. All we have politically is one another.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharles D. Ellison is a veteran political strategist and a contributing editor at The Root.
