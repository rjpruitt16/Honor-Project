Bush stunned Washington by nominating her to the Supreme Court in October 2005. Miers, who would have been the third woman to serve on the high court, was meant to succeed the first \u2014 Sandra Day O'Connor, who was retiring.\n\nNationally, the big story that autumn was Hurricane Katrina, which had devastated New Orleans and much of the Gulf Coast. But it was the storm over Miers that dominated the nation's capital that October and force her to withdraw as nominee.\n\nThere are two reasons that saga returned to capital conversations this week in connection with the decision to nominate Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson to run the Department of Veterans Affairs. One was that both Miers and Jackson were seen as surprising and highly personal choices who lacked conventional qualifications for the jobs in question.\n\nThe second was that both Miers and Jackson were known for their strong personal connection to the president they served, who had reason to appreciate and return their loyalty.\n\nMiers had served Bush in a succession of roles beginning in 1995 during his first term as governor of Texas. Miers served as Bush's personal attorney and also most of a term as chair of the Texas Lottery Commission, resigning early in 2000 as Bush was seeking the Republican nomination for president.\n\nIn January 2001, she came to Washington as assistant to the president and staff secretary. In 2003, she became deputy chief of staff for policy and, the following year, White House counsel. Eleven months later, Bush nominated her for the Supreme Court.\n\nWith no time as a judge or experience with constitutional law, Miers seemed a sharp departure from other nominees in both parties in recent decades \u2014 most of whom had extensive service on the federal bench, including the U.S. Courts of Appeals.\n\nSome critics at the time suggested that Miers had won Bush's permanent gratitude by helping him handle inquiries into his military record, which included time in the Texas Air National Guard during the Vietnam War. She was also quoted calling Bush \"the most brilliant man\" she had ever met and the \"best governor ever.\"\n\nBut if Miers was a target for enemies of her boss, she probably suffered more from criticism on the political right. Conservative legal groups were wary of her, concerned that she was not a strong and proven jurist who could be influential in the manner of then-Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nSenate Republicans who had not been consulted about her selection were lukewarm about it at best. (Then-Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi said he could not \"get excited about\" her nomination.) She was nothing like John Roberts, who had been confirmed as the successor to Chief Justice William Rehnquist earlier that autumn.\n\nBut if the Senate was unenthusiastic, conservative media commentators and talk radio hosts were far less restrained, noting that Miers had been a Democrat who gave money to other Democrats such as Al Gore as late as 1988. They questioned her views on abortion, despite her repeated public pledges of opposition to Roe v. Wade. In fact, there were rumors that she privately supported Roe, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that established a woman's constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nHer meetings with members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who would vote first on her nomination, did not go well. She struggled with their questions about the law and elements of constitutional theory. The chairman and ranking member of the committee sent back her written questionnaire and asked for better answers. Other Republican senators went further, asking her to turn over memos she had written advising the president.\n\nAt that point, the White House announced that Miers had asked to withdraw her nomination \u2014 just three weeks into the process. Bush would subsequently nominate Samuel Alito for the vacancy. Alito was confirmed in January 2006 and is a core member of the court's conservative bloc. Miers returned to the White House as legal counsel and stayed until January 2007.\n\nThe story of Miers' ill-fated selection was recalled this week after Trump tweeted an announcement of Jackson as his choice to replace VA Secretary David Shulkin, who was fired.\n\nThe president had been a Shulkin fan as recently as last spring, when they collaborated on legislation to overhaul the department. But the secretary's business trip to Europe later in the year included his wife and side trips that the VA inspector general called serious violations of ethics and policy.\n\nJackson has been a career Navy physician, serving stateside and in a forward military hospital in Iraq. He has at times supervised a small staff of immediate subordinates but nothing like the 360,000 employees he will have in the VA, the second-largest federal department by number of personnel, behind the Defense Department. The VA serves more than 9 million veterans and maintains 170 medical centers and more than a thousand outpatient clinics.\n\nJackson also evoked Miers' lavish praise of her boss in his effusive report on Trump's health in a famous news conference in January. Although he acknowledged the president could lose weight and exercise more, he said he was plenty healthy to serve one or two terms. \"It's called genetics,\" he said. \"You know, just great genes ... incredible genes.\"\n\nIn a moment of hyperbole, Jackson said the president, with better diet, might live 200 years.\n\nThese rather superficial similarities might soon be forgotten if no more consequential obstacles arise. But Jackson, like Miers, must face confirmation by the Senate, where initial reaction to his nomination was muted. Powerful senators such as Johnny Isakson, the Republican who chairs the Committee on Veterans Affairs, were public admirers and defenders of Shulkin.\n\nThe former secretary also had strong support from such traditional veterans' groups as the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans and AMVETS \u2014 all of which would be expected to have influence in the confirmation process for Shulkin's successor.", "keywords": ["department", "dr", "veterans", "jackson", "fall", "white", "house", "ronny", "president", "harriet", "bush", "miers", "cautionary", "va", "tale", "nomination"], "polarity": 0.13144284287141433, "subjectivity": 0.3803822368108081},

Complex budget and spending rules limit how far government agencies can stray from strict funding guidelines included in spending bills.\n\nOnce Congress approves a spending measure and the president signs the bill into law, the spending levels are locked in until the end of the fiscal year. The spending bill that passed last week locks in spending levels through the end of September.\n\nSpeaking Friday in Washington, D.C., Ronald Vitiello, the acting deputy commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, outlined how the agency plans to spend the money appropriated in the spending bill for construction on the southwest border. Much, if not most, of the construction will be replacing existing barriers. He was unable to say how much will go to new barriers where nothing currently exists. Vitiello highlighted projects in San Diego and Calexico, Calif. and in Texas. \"We appreciate this down payment for our needs,\" he said at the briefing with reporters.\n\nEvery federal department has some flexibility to shift money around as their needs change. The rules for the Department of Defense are the most generous of the bunch. That extra wiggle room doesn't go far enough to cover the huge cost of building a border wall, according to Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert at the Center For Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\"Money is appropriated by Congress for a certain purpose and with certain constraints,\" Harrison said. \"Once its appropriated, you have to use it for what it was appropriated for.\"\n\nPolitics On Visit To California, President Trump Reviews Prototypes For Border Wall On Visit To California, President Trump Reviews Prototypes For Border Wall Listen \u00b7 3:56 3:56\n\nHarrison said the military can move smaller amounts, in the range of several million dollars, from program to program using what is known as reprogramming authority. But Congress has to sign off on any major funding shift.\n\n\"You can't do $25 billion,\" Harrison said. \"They need to use that authority every year because sometimes money winds up being in the wrong place. You wouldn't want to be burning up much, if any, of your money on the wall.\"\n\nCongressional approval isn't easy to obtain. The chairmen and ranking members on the House and Senate Armed Services Committees and the House and Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees would all have to sign off on the transfer. That means four Democrats and four Republicans would all have to agree to cut $25 billion from somewhere else in the Pentagon budget to pay to build the border wall.\n\nHouse and Senate aides also poured cold water on the plan. There is no legal way for the Department of Defense to make that kind of transfer without new legislation from Congress, according to one of those aides.\n\nNPR via YouTube\n\nThe plan also faces major political hurdles \u2014 even within the Republican Party.\n\nThe spending bill set aside nearly $660 billion for the Pentagon \u2014 a roughly $61 billion increase from fiscal year 2017.\n\nRepublican leaders celebrated that increase as the biggest boost in defense funding in 15 years. Shifting $25 billion to the wall would make a huge dent in that increase.\n\nThat amount of money would be almost enough to buy two more of the $13 billion aircraft carriers Trump unveiled last year. It nearly matches the $25.4 billion increase to \"procure, replace and upgrade\" platforms and weapons included in the spending bill.\n\nAn official congressional outline of the newly-approved spending measure reported that those planned investments include $23.8 billion to buy 14 Navy ships, $1.6 billion for 30 new and 50 re-manufactured Apache helicopters and $1.1 billion for 56 Black Hawk helicopters.", "keywords": ["spending", "pay", "trump", "congress", "president", "pentagon", "wall", "money", "billion", "using", "harder", "defense", "border"], "polarity": 0.05233534809006506, "subjectivity": 0.41362840513783894},

Sessions does not rule out the possibility of appointing another special counsel in the future, but says for now he has assigned the U.S. attorney for Utah, John W. Huber, to look into the claims.\n\n\"I am confident that Mr. Huber's review will include a full, complete and objective evaluation of these matters that is consistent with the law and the facts,\" the attorney general said in his letter.\n\nSessions said he receives regular updates from Huber. Once Huber concludes his review, he will provide recommendations about new areas of possible investigation as well as whether new resources are required and \"whether any matters merit the appointment of a Special Counsel,\" Sessions said.\n\nHuber is a veteran prosecutor who has been confirmed twice by the Senate as U.S. attorney for Utah \u2014 once in 2015 after he was nominated by President Obama, and again in 2017 after he was nominated by President Trump.\n\nSessions said Huber is conducting his work in cooperation with Justice Department Inspector General, Michael E. Horowitz.\n\nHorowitz announced on Wednesday that he is launching a review to examine whether the department and the FBI violated legal requirements or procedures when applying for court approval for surveillance orders on a former Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page.\n\nWhile Republicans welcomed the inspector general's review, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., at least, said it did not preclude the need for a special counsel to \"ensure the investigation is thorough and complete.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers have also made allegations of political influence on decisions made at senior levels of the Justice Department and FBI in 2016. Democrats say all of the GOP allegations are an attempt to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nThose Republican calls for another special counsel have come from several powerful members of Congress, including Sens. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and John Cornyn, R-Texas, as well as House Judiciary Committee Chairman Robert Goodlatte, R-Va., and House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C.\n\nGoodlatte and Gowdy said in a statement they were \"encouraged\" by the designation of Huber. \"While we continue to believe the appointment of a second Special Counsel is necessary, this is a step in the right direction,\" the two chairmen said. \"We expect that U.S. Attorney Huber, given his reputation, will conduct an independent and thorough investigation.\"\n\nThe two Republican lawmakers added: \"We applaud the Attorney General for demonstrating his commitment to this investigation by selecting an individual outside of Washington, D.C. to lead the review. We think it is important that Mr. Huber report directly to the Attorney General since the Attorney General, as the head of the Justice Department, reserves the right to appoint a special counsel in the future. In the meantime we intend to continue our investigation into the decisions made and not made by DOJ in 2016 and 2017.\"\n\nNPR Justice Correspondent Carrie Johnson and NPR White House Correspondent Tamara Keith contributed to this report.", "keywords": ["justice", "attorney", "department", "investigation", "sessions", "republican", "counsel", "huber", "special", "general", "second", "review", "requests"], "polarity": 0.14283746556473823, "subjectivity": 0.42820891229982133},

In a letter written to the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which has oversight of the U.S. Census Bureau, four Democratic senators are calling for a hearing on the upcoming national head count.\n\nSens. Kamala Harris of California, Tom Carper of Delaware, Gary Peters of Michigan and Claire McCaskill of Missouri \u2014 the committee's ranking member \u2014 are requesting testimony from Census Bureau staff and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the bureau and made the decision to add the citizenship question. They cite deep concerns about the question as well as the lack of permanent leadership at the bureau and the operational challenges of carrying out the 2020 census.\n\n\"Together, these problems risk a substantial undercount of persons in the 2020 Census with wide ranging implications for proportional representation in Congress, state government share of federal dollars, the accuracy of information businesses use to decide where to locate, the availability of affordable broadband service, and natural disaster funding,\" the senators write in the letter, which was provided to NPR by Harris' office.\n\n\"We are concerned that the addition of the citizenship question is tainted by improper political considerations,\" the letter continues. \"DOJ requested the addition of this question in December 2017 based on an unsupported assertion that citizenship data are needed to enforce Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act even though the last time a citizenship question was asked was before the passage of the Voting Rights Act, and no similar requests have been made to support enforcement.\"\n\nOn the House side, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., issued a call on Tuesday for a similar hearing on the citizenship question by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, for which he serves as the ranking member.\n\n\"The Trump Administration's plan to insert a new, untested question on citizenship will increase costs for American taxpayers and decrease the accuracy of the census itself,\" Cummings said in a written statement.\n\nOn Thursday, the Census Bureau revealed the wording of the citizenship question in a report to Congress: \"Is this person a citizen of the United States?\" Such a question has not been asked of all U.S. households on the census since 1950, although smaller Census Bureau surveys have included questions about citizenship.\n\nThe Justice Department sent the Commerce Department a late request in December for the question to be added, close to nine months after the Census Bureau released a final report of question topics for the 2020 census to Congress.\n\nDOJ said it needs a better count of voting-age citizens from the census in order to enforce protections against voting discrimination under the Voting Rights Act. The department has relied on estimates of U.S. citizens based on the American Community Survey, an annual survey the Census Bureau conducts with a smaller sample of about 3.5 million participants, since the law was enacted. But critics of the citizenship question say they're skeptical of the timing of the Justice Department's request. They're worried that noncitizens, especially immigrants in the country illegally, will be further discouraged from participating in the national head count.\n\n\n\nIn his memo Monday approving the request for a citizenship question, Ross wrote: \"I find that the need for accurate citizenship data and the limited burden that the reinstatement of the citizenship question would impose outweigh fears about a potentially lower response rate.\"\n\nAsked about Cummings' call for a hearing on the decision, a spokesperson for the Commerce Department responded to NPR by email: \"After a thorough review of the legal, program and policy considerations, as well as numerous discussions with the Census Bureau leadership and interested stakeholders, Secretary Ross determined that reinstatement of a citizenship question on the 2020 decennial census is necessary to provide complete and accurate data in response to the DOJ request.\"", "keywords": ["department", "ross", "democrats", "question", "senate", "census", "voting", "hearing", "bureau", "citizenship", "2020", "request"], "polarity": 0.020497835497835504, "subjectivity": 0.45769119769119765},

I think this was really just being used in a political context to try to make sure that I wasn't as effective as a leader moving forward.\"\n\nPrivatization has been the major issue at the department, and political appointees within the administration had been discussing removing Shulkin over the matter. Shulkin demurred from pointing a finger squarely at President Trump but described a VA riddled with political pressure and conflict.\n\nTrump announced Wednesday that he was nominating his personal doctor, Rear Adm. Ronny L. Jackson, to replace Shulkin. Until Jackson is confirmed by the Senate, Trump said, Robert Wilkie of the Department of Defense will serve as acting secretary of the VA.\n\nShulkin described great support from Congress but noted the VA has struggled for many decades \u2014 with high turnover of its leadership as one cause.\n\n\"We've gotten so much done,\" he said, \"but in the last few months, it really has changed. Not from Congress, but from these internal political appointees that were trying to politicize VA and trying to make sure our progress stopped. It's been very difficult.\"\n\nShulkin's departure comes weeks after the release of an inspector general's report that was highly critical of an official trip he took to Europe last spring. Shulkin brought along his wife, paying for her travel with agency funds as the two enjoyed several days of tourism in between the secretary's official meetings. The report also said he had improperly accepted a gift of Wimbledon tennis tickets on the trip.\n\nShulkin told NPR that all expenses were approved in advance by an internal ethics committee and that when the inspector general later didn't like the expenditures, Shulkin wrote a check to the government.\n\n\"No one's ever mentioned what the purpose of this trip was,\" he argued. \"This was the five allies conference, a trip that the VA secretary has participated in for 43 years with major allies. We had over 40 hours of direct meetings. I gave three separate lectures. This is our one forum where we share how to care for our veterans among all of our allies.\n\n\"This was being characterized as a European vacation, it was far from that. ... I went out, never used government money for that. The single expenditure spent was on a coach airfare for my wife who was officially invited. Everything was preapproved by our ethics committee. When the inspector general didn't like the way that my staff had handled the approval, I wrote a check back to the government.\"\n\nThe White House has not replied to a request for comment on Shulkin's accounting of events.\n\nShulkin is the second administration official to lose his job after criticism of travel expenses; Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price resigned in September.\n\nThe president said he would nominate Jackson to the post. Although he is a relative unknown as an administrator, he reportedly has expressed eagerness to take over the reins of the VA.\n\nThe White House says chief of staff John Kelly informed Shulkin of his dismissal before the president tweeted it on Wednesday.\n\nShulkin, a medical doctor and former hospital executive who was undersecretary at the VA during the Obama administration, is the latest in a long line of high-level White House departures in recent weeks. This month alone, national security adviser H.R. McMaster, Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Trump's personal assistant John McEntee and Director of the National Economic Council Gary Cohn have either left or are on their way out.\n\nAs NPR's Quil Lawrence, who covers veterans affairs, reported on Morning Edition on Thursday, emails had been exchanged between political appointees within the administration \"who were actively planning to use this investigation to push out Shulkin and his top deputies because they thought he was not moving fast enough to increase the use of private care at the VA.\"\n\nIn a New York Times op-ed published the same day he was fired, Shulkin pointed to successes in his time at the VA, citing reduced wait time, better mental health services and faster processing of claims. \"Unemployment among veterans is near its lowest level in years, at 3.5 percent, and the percent of veterans who have regained trust in V.A. services has risen to 70 percent, from 46 percent four years ago,\" he writes.\n\nThe big veterans organizations were pulling for Shulkin, Quil says, even though he was not a veteran.\n\nIn a statement following the announcement of his dismissal, the American Legion said: \"Secretary Shulkin has acted in the best interests of America's veterans and was making meaningful, positive changes at the VA.\"\n\nThe group said it would \"continue to work vigorously to ensure our nation's veterans have the efficient, transparent, and properly functioning VA that they deserve.\"\n\nJackson's profile rose in Trump's eyes after he conducted a sweeping news conference in January in which he delivered a rosy picture of the president's health, according to The Associated Press.\n\nHowever, some veterans groups say they are concerned over his lack of qualifications to lead the VA, a vast agency employing some 350,000 staff members.\n\n\"We are disappointed and already quite concerned about this nominee,\" said Joe Chenelly, the national executive director of AMVETS. \"The administration needs to be ready to prove that he's qualified to run such a massive agency, a $200 billion bureaucracy.\"\n\nDisabled American Veterans said in a statement: \"While we look forward to learning more about the qualifications and views of the new nominee, we are extremely concerned about the existing leadership vacuum in VA.\"\n\n\"At a time of critical negotiations over the future of veterans health care reform, VA today has no Secretary, no Under Secretary of Health, and the named Acting Secretary has no background in health care and no apparent experience working in or with the Department,\" it said.", "keywords": ["political", "trip", "fired", "veterans", "white", "shulkin", "administration", "trump", "muzzled", "va", "health", "secretary", "house"], "polarity": 0.0985945446139621, "subjectivity": 0.36532306420655936},

The only victims in this situation are the two victims in the hospital in the U.K. right now.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the Salisbury hospital that has been treating the Skripals announced that Yulia was \"improving rapidly.\" Her father remains in critical but stable condition.\n\nRussia has already kicked out 23 U.K. diplomats, after the U.K. expelled the same number of Russian diplomats three days earlier.\n\nAnd some two dozen countries and NATO have rallied in solidarity around the U.K. in recent days, expelling more than 150 Russian diplomats.\n\nThat Russia is retaliating comes as no surprise.\n\n\"Rest assured, we will respond,\" Lavrov said Tuesday. \"The reason is that no one would like to tolerate such obnoxiousness, and we won't either.\"\n\nLavrov told TASS, the Russian news agency, that the U.S. has used \"colossal blackmail\" to get other countries on board with expelling Russian diplomats.\n\nEarlier in the week, the Russian Embassy in Washington tweeted a poll, asking which U.S. consulate should Russia close. (St. Petersburg won.)\n\nIn its statement Thursday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said, \"It is recommended that the US authorities, who are promoting and encouraging this defamation campaign against Russia, come to their senses and stop their unreasonable actions aimed at destroying bilateral relations.\"\n\nBut Nauert aimed to portray Russia as a lone actor on the world stage. \"Russia is choosing through its actions to further diplomatically, and also economically, isolate itself, not just from the United States, from the world,\" she said.\n\nGeorgia became the latest country to act against Russia when it announced on Thursday that it was showing a Russian diplomat the door.\n\nNauert called the move \"significant, given that Georgia is in the backyard of Russia.\"\n\nNPR's Kevin Beesley and NPR's Lucian Kim contributed to this report", "keywords": ["60", "consulate", "diplomats", "nauert", "united", "retaliates", "statement", "expels", "russia", "uk", "states", "action", "foreign", "russian", "american"], "polarity": 0.0162046908315565, "subjectivity": 0.2954690831556503},

This year? I've given more money than I ever thought I would do,\" said David Frieder, a retiree who attended Saturday's gun march in downtown Denver.\n\nFrieder is holding a protest sign that attacks Colorado politicians who have taken contributions from the National Rifle Association. Among them is his congressman, Republican Mike Coffman. \"He continues to support the NRA and take money from the NRA, and doesn't return it, and I'm tired of it,\" he said.\n\nFrieder is exactly the kind of voter \u2014 white, suburban, and angry \u2014 that Democrats see as critical to picking off enough congressional districts this November to take control of the U.S. House.\n\nDistricts like Coffman's are at the front lines of a rising \"blue wave.\" He is one of about two dozen Republicans representing a district Hillary Clinton carried in the 2016 presidential election. Barack Obama likewise won the suburban Denver district in both the 2008 and 2012 elections.\n\nDespite that Democratic tilt to the district, Coffman has won re-election four times.\n\nPresident Trump's unpopularity, and an unusually mobilized Democratic base for a midterm election year, once again put Coffman at the top of Democrats' target list for 2018.\n\nThe gun debate has particular resonance here. A few miles away is where the Columbine School shooting occurred in 1999. Coffman's district includes the Aurora movie theater where 12 were killed in a 2012 mass shooting.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ross Taylor/Getty Images Ross Taylor/Getty Images\n\nFor Ashley Kochkanyan, a stay-at-home mom who lives in the district, the gun debate this time has changed her mind. After the Columbine shooting in 1999, she joined a similar, but smaller, gun protest outside the Denver Capitol. \"It was just a really somber quiet time, and I think that we were hoping something would happen then and it hasn't,\" said Kochkanyan, who attended Saturday's march 19 years later with her 11-year-old son. Kochkanyan says she voted for Coffman in the past, but she won't any longer.\n\nVoters like her are why the leading Democratic candidate in the race, Jason Crow, is embracing support for tougher gun laws to win over voters like Kochkanyan. He chose guns as the first digital issue ad of his campaign. It's a notable break from recent elections, in which Democrats have shied away from making the gun debate a central focus of campaigns in competitive districts.\n\nIn an interview with NPR, Crow said he thinks Coffman is uniquely vulnerable this year because of those two factors unique to 2018: President Trump and a shifting debate on guns.\n\n\"People see what Donald Trump and his presidency are doing to this country and to our community. Mike Coffman is a rubber stamp for him. They've had enough,\" Crow said, \"They've had enough of his support by the NRA and his inaction on gun violence in this community that's been scarred by it, and they want change.\"\n\nCrow is polling competitively, and he has some built-in advantages. Democrats outnumber Republicans here. He's a young political newcomer with no voting record to attack, and as a lawyer and military veteran he has a natural appeal to the district's white, affluent college-educated suburbanites.\n\nChipping away at Coffman's support among the district's diverse minority groups that make up more than one-third of the population here, may not be as easy.\n\n\"He came back\"\n\nFew Republicans represent districts as ethnically and racially diverse as Colorado's 6th Congressional District, which is home to one of the nation's largest communities of Ethiopian immigrants.\n\nOutside recent Sunday services at St. Mary's Ethiopian Orthodox Church, Nebiyu Asfaw, a congregant and progressive Democrat, explains his left-leaning communities view of their Republican congressman.\n\n\"Quite honestly there has not been anyone, any elected official that has worked as hard for the Ethiopian community as Mike Coffman, that's just the truth,\" Asfaw said.\n\nHe said his community largely supports more gun control, but it's not just a driving issue compared to others. Instead, Ethiopian-Americans are pressing Congress to act on a resolution condemning human rights abuses back in Ethiopia. Coffman co-authored the resolution, which recently passed the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and is scheduled for a full House vote when lawmakers return from the two-week spring recess.\n\nEven as the national climate turns against Republicans, Coffman still has a deep reservoir of support from local communities like this one because of his close attention to their concerns.\n\nIt's why voters like Ethiopian-American Fikru Ayele, an independent, say they continue to support him. \"After he get elected, he came back. Most politicians, they don't come back and ask you what you need, and he did. He did, he came back and ask us,\" he said.\n\nIn an interview with NPR, Coffman says his relationship to his district's many diverse communities has helped him defy the electoral odds in what is increasingly Democratic terrain.\n\n\"I've turned what was designed to be an adverse situation for me, in terms of diversity of this district and the performance of this district, I think, into a positive,\" he said.\n\nEven Democratic critics like Jason Crow don't dispute Coffman's outreach. \"He's gone out and he's shown up repeatedly to these communities and you know, that's fine,\" he said, \"But we're now in an environment where leading means more than showing up.\"\n\nNational wave versus local roots\n\nCoffman believes showing up will matter. On a recent Sunday in February, his schedule included stops at a mosque, a Korean church, a Hindu festival and a Taiwanese Lantern Festival. \"Then I had a tutorial in Spanish that evening. I have every Sunday a tutor that comes in for two hours,\" he said.\n\nHe started learning Spanish about four years ago, when the 2011 round of redistricting put him in a district with more Hispanics as part of a Democratic attempt to unseat Coffman. Since then, he has debated campaign opponents in Spanish, and appears every Friday on Spanish talk radio that serves the district's Hispanic community.\n\nIt's that level of motivation \u2014 and a willingness to moderate his prior political views \u2014 that has led a 63-year-old, military veteran, white, Republican male to cultivate relationships in minority communities that historically lean Democratic.\n\nHis GOP colleagues regularly point to Coffman as one of their best, battle-tested incumbents. His campaign boasts of a work ethic that often includes 100-hour work weeks, a 24/7 campaign mentality, and personal discipline that includes a 500 push-up-a-day regimen.\n\nWhile his views on guns have not moderated, he has opposed his party's efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and is a vocal critic of his party's often harsh rhetoric and policies towards immigrants.\n\nOn Monday, he visited with Colorado Chinese News President Wendy Chao, whose foreign language newspaper reaches about 45,000 Coloradans. She greeted the congressman as \"my best friend.\"\n\n\"This is from my heart, I will say: Congressman Michael Coffman is the only one who really care our Asian community, minority community, you know?\" she said, citing a two-decade long friendship dating back to his time in state office. Coffman shows up, Chao says, and not just in election years.\n\nIn this district where at least 120 languages are spoken, the deciding question for voters this November may not simply be about Trump's approval rating or gun rights, but rather the answer to the question: Who speaks for me?", "keywords": ["districts", "democratic", "communities", "gun", "debate", "support", "republican", "coffman", "endangered", "trump", "guns", "district", "unseat", "community", "house", "campaign"], "polarity": 0.08308473704513307, "subjectivity": 0.32409001889199907},

Ronny L. Jackson, the president announced on Twitter on Wednesday.\n\n\"I am thankful for Dr. David Shulkin's service to our country and to our GREAT VETERANS!\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"I appreciate the work of Dr. David Shulkin and the many great things we did together at Veterans Affairs, including the VA Accountability Act that he was helpful in getting passed,\" the president said in an additional statement released by the White House. \"He has been a great supporter of veterans across the country and I am grateful for his service.\"\n\nUntil Jackson is confirmed by the Senate, Trump said, Robert Wilkie of the Department of Defense will serve as acting secretary of the VA. \"Mr. Wilkie is currently the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness at the Department of Defense and overseas health affairs, welfare and quality of life for military families,\" the president said.\n\nTrump said he was \"proud\" to nominate the White House's top doctor to take over the VA. \"Admiral Jackson is highly trained and qualified and as a service member himself, he has seen firsthand the tremendous sacrifice our veterans make and has a deep appreciation for the debt our great country owes them,\" the president said.\n\nJackson recently presided over Trump's first presidential physical and gave the president a clean bill of health. Jackson has cared for three presidents since joining the White House medical unit in 2006. He was formally named physician to the president in 2013 by then-President Barack Obama. Jackson grew up in West Texas and attended Texas A&M and the University of Texas Medical Branch. He specializes in emergency medicine.\n\nAccording to USA Today, Shulkin said in a statement that Trump \"should have a cabinet member that he is comfortable with.\"\n\n\"To our nation's Veterans, I want you to know that I will always fight for you no matter where I go. To the dedicated employees of VA, I thank you for your service. I know that you will continue to keep our Veterans at the forefront of everything you do,\" Shulkin said.\n\nHouse Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Phil Roe, R-Tenn., praised Shulkin's tenure, calling him a \"friend\" who had \"done a fantastic job and I hate to see him go.\"\n\n\"That said, I respect President Trump's decision, support the president's agenda and remain willing to work with anyone committed to doing the right thing on behalf of our nation's veterans,\" Roe also said in a statement. \"I am in the process of reaching out to Dr. Jackson and I look forward to building a strong relationship with him also.\"\n\nSenate Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., said Shulkin had \"made a tremendous impact toward improving the lives of veterans during his time at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\"\n\nSen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., the ranking member on the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, said Shulkin had \"severed honorably\" and now \"the VA needs a strong leader at the top who will listen to veterans, strengthen the VA, and work with Congress to implement bipartisan reforms. I look forward to meeting Admiral Jackson soon and seeing if he is up to the job.\"\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee and a former chairman of the panel, warned against any nominee who might support privatization of the VA.\n\n\"Every major veterans' organization in this country vigorously opposes the privatization of the VA. I stand with them. Our job is to strengthen the VA in order to provide high-quality care to our veterans, not dismember it,\" Sanders said. \"The Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs should not approve any nominee for secretary who supports the privatization of the VA.\"\n\nShulkin had opposed such a move, though some conservatives have championed the idea. It's not known where Jackson stands on the issue.\n\nVoteVets, a progressive group, questioned whether Jackson was sufficiently prepared for the job.\n\n\"Other than a total lack of awareness of where he stands on any issue, we are also concerned that he has never managed an agency like the VA. Now is not the time for people who need training wheels, when it comes to managing a massive health care system,\" VoteVets director of government relations Will Fischer said in a statement. \"While we wouldn't doubt Dr. Jackson's medical credentials, it is essential that he prove that he is intimately aware of how the agency works.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nShulkin began his tenure in the Trump administration with a few strikes against him. He was the first nonveteran to lead the department, instead bringing years of experience as a physician and a health care CEO. He was offered the job only after several others turned it down, and he was an Obama appointee \u2014 the lone holdover in the Trump White House.\n\nThat made it all the more unlikely for Shulkin to be so successful \u2014 for a time. Known on Capitol Hill as a technocrat brought in to help overhaul the VA in 2015, he coasted to confirmation \u2014 100 to 0 \u2014 by the Senate. He hit the ground running, already adept at the labyrinthine VA health network of more than 1,000 hospitals and clinics. With bipartisan agreement on many fixes needed at the VA, Shulkin helped push through an expansion of mental health care, increased suicide prevention and a law making it easier to remove poor-performing officials.\n\nFor a time, Trump seemed to really like Shulkin, even joking that he would never have to use his reality TV line \u2014 \"You're fired\" \u2014 on the secretary.\n\n\"We'll never have to use those words on our David. We will never use those words on you. That's for sure,\" Trump said in June.\n\nBut Shulkin was making enemies among the administration's other political appointees, especially those with connections to Concerned Veterans for America, a lobbying group linked to the conservative Koch brothers. In a December email obtained by The Washington Post, senior VA appointees Jake Leinenkugel and Camilo J. Sandoval openly discussed ousting Shulkin, his chief of staff and his deputy because Shulkin was not aggressively pushing an increased use of private care for veterans.\n\nShortly after the news of Shulkin's impending departure broke, the Concerned Veterans for America's executive director Dan Caldwell said in a statement that while \"Shulkin made significant headway in reforming the department,\" he \"ultimately became a distraction from the important task of improving health care for our veterans. We are hopeful that this change will end the recent distractions at the VA and put the focus back on advancing policy that will ensure veterans get the health care and other benefits they have earned.\"\n\nShulkin gave his opponents an opening in the form of an inspector general's report that harshly criticized his official trip to Europe last spring. The secretary spent 11 days there filling the time in between meetings with several days of tourism. He brought his wife along, paying for her travel with official funds. The IG report also said Shulkin improperly accepted tickets to Wimbledon for him and his wife. The total amount of questionable spending wasn't high by Trump administration standards (see: Ryan Zinke's door or Ben Carson's table), but veterans living on a monthly disability check were not amused, and the trip came shortly after Shulkin had warned VA officials to keep down unnecessary costs.\n\nThen his tenure got strange. Headlines openly pondered who was in charge at the VA, and veterans service organizations, which strongly support Shulkin and oppose privatization, started using words like \"coup\" and circulating lists of officials in the VA who were trying to undermine Trump's VA secretary. That list included Shulkin's top two public affairs officials, who were accused of lobbying Congress to get rid of Shulkin. The secretary apparently lost control of his own public messaging. His own statements were removed from the VA website and his chief of staff abruptly replaced.\n\nShulkin took to his cellphone to directly contact reporters and give his side of the story \u2014 even claiming he had the president's support to \"purge\" what he called \"subversion\" at the department.", "keywords": ["veterans", "jackson", "shulkin", "affairs", "president", "trump", "replace", "va", "health", "secretary", "david", "care"], "polarity": 0.14687292865864296, "subjectivity": 0.48699895342752497},

Horowitz, said in a statement Wednesday that the review will examine whether the Justice Department and the FBI followed the proper procedures and legal requirements when applying for surveillance orders \"relating to a certain U.S. person\" before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.\n\nThat individual is not named, but it appears to be a reference to Carter Page, who served as a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. The FBI sought and received a surveillance order on Page in October 2016, after he had left Trump's team.\n\nRepublicans on the House intelligence committee released a memo last month that alleged the FBI and Justice Department abused their surveillance authority to target Page in the early stages of the DOJ Russia probe. Republicans also alleged that the FBI improperly relied on an unverified dossier compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, in its application.\n\nThat document, known as the Trump-Russia dossier, was commissioned by a strategic intelligence firm, Fusion GPS, that was hired by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democrats.\n\nThe inspector general's review will also look into what the FBI and Justice Department knew \"from an alleged confidential source\" as well as their \"relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate\" to the surveillance applications.\n\nAfter Republicans released their memo in February, they urged the Justice Department to examine the allegations of misconduct. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he referred the matter to the inspector general's office.\n\nDemocrats dismissed the Republican allegations as nothing more than an attempt to protect President Trump and undermine special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nIn response to the Republican memo, Democrats on the House intelligence committee released their own countermemo that concluded there was no misconduct on the part of the Justice Department or FBI in their surveillance of Page. They also said the FBI did not solely rely on the Trump-Russia dossier in its surveillance applications, but rather on multiple sources and an abundance of material to support their case.\n\nOn Wednesday, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, slammed the decision to open a review.\n\n\"It is a shame that the Inspector General has to devote resources to investigate a conspiracy theory as fact-free, openly political, and thoroughly debunked as the President's so-called 'FISA abuse,' \" Nadler said in a statement.\n\n\"Any objective review of these claims should tell us what we already know \u2014 that the FBI was right, that there was sufficient evidence to continue investigating certain Trump campaign officials for their connections to the Russian government, and that the Republicans are desperate to distract from that investigation,\" he added.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, welcomed the inspector general's review.\n\nThe chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Charles Grassley of Iowa, and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham \u2014 who both asked the inspector general to review alleged surveillance misconduct and the FBI's relationship with Steele \u2014 applauded the decision to look into the matter. But Graham said he still thinks a second special counsel should be appointed \"to ensure the investigation is thorough and complete.\"", "keywords": ["justice", "department", "fbi", "alleged", "page", "inspector", "trump", "abuses", "watchdog", "surveillance", "departments", "review", "internal", "campaign"], "polarity": 0.05141163184641445, "subjectivity": 0.31505740636175417},

A quick history of the decennial survey makes that clear.\n\nThe long answer\n\nThe census has been conducted every decade since 1790 to get a national head count used most critically to decide the distribution of congressional representation. At first it was conducted by U.S. marshals, but later surveys were sent to most American households, with census workers helping those who didn't promptly return their surveys.\n\nThe last time the Census Bureau asked all U.S. households a question about U.S. citizenship was in 1950. That form asked where each person was born and in a follow-up question asked, \"If foreign born \u2014 Is he naturalized?\"\n\nIn 1960, there was no such question about citizenship, only about place of birth.\n\nSanders mentioned the year 1965 on Tuesday, but the census only comes every 10 years, so it isn't clear what she was referring to, and the White House did not respond to a request for clarification.\n\nIn 1970, the Census Bureau began sending around two questionnaires: a short-form questionnaire to gather basic population information and a long form that asked detailed questions about everything from household income to plumbing. The short form went to most households in America. The long form was sent to a much smaller sample of households, 1 in 6. Most people didn't get it.\n\nStarting in 1970, questions about citizenship were included in the long-form questionnaire but not the short form. For instance, in 2000, those who received the long form were asked, \"Is this person a CITIZEN of the United States?\"\n\nThe short form kept it simple: name, relationship, age, sex, Hispanic origin, race, marital status and whether the home is owned or rented.\n\nLater, the census added the American Community Survey, conducted every year and sent to 3.5 million households. It began being fully implemented in 2005. It asks many of the same questions as the census long-form surveys from 1970 to 2000, including the citizenship question.\n\nSanders said that in 2010 the citizenship question was removed. In fact, there was no long form that year \u2014 it had been replaced by the annual American Community Survey. The decennial census form asked just 10 questions.\n\nThe state of California has already sued to block the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census, and New York's state attorney general has announced plans for a multistate lawsuit. The concern expressed by states with large undocumented immigrant populations is that asking about citizenship will scare people off, forms won't get filled out and the count won't be accurate, affecting federal funding and the number of congressional seats. (The Census Bureau is legally required to keep answers confidential, even from the FBI and other government entities. That means it isn't allowed to release data identifying an individual. But federal agencies and researchers can request census information on specific population groups.)\n\nIn a memo explaining his reasoning, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross dismissed concerns about incentive to participate.\n\n\"The Department of Commerce is not able to determine definitively how inclusion of a citizenship question on the decennial census will impact responsiveness. However, even if there is some impact on responses, the value of more complete and accurate data derived from surveying the entire population outweighs such concerns. Completing and returning decennial census questionnaires is required by Federal law, those responses are protected by law, and inclusion of a citizenship question on the 2020 decennial census will provide more complete information for those who respond,\" Ross wrote.\n\nBut if the 2020 census form does ultimately ask about citizenship status, it will be the first time the question will be asked of all U.S. households since 1950.\n\nNPR's Hansi Lo Wang contributed to this report.", "keywords": ["decennial", "check", "fact", "question", "census", "standard", "asked", "short", "citizenship", "long", "2020", "households", "form"], "polarity": 0.11116919803360481, "subjectivity": 0.40223604079536274},

In each state, the debate is playing out in remarkably similar ways, like a dozen alternate Marsy's Law universes.\n\nBehind all of them is one well-funded, sophisticated campaign called Marsy's Law for All. The group's goal is to get crime victims' rights into every state's constitution and ultimately the U.S. Constitution.\n\ntoggle caption New Hampshire Public Radio\n\nWherever it goes, the Marsy's Law campaign uses largely the same playbook: hire a team of top lobbyists, secure big political endorsements, and a run a polished ad campaign.\n\nThe campaign has its origins in the story of Marsy Nicholas, who was murdered by an ex-boyfriend in California in 1983.\n\nJust a week after the murder, Henry Nicholas and Marcella Leach, Marsy's brother and mother, ran into him while he was out on bail.\n\nThey told the story to a local TV station in LA in 2009.\n\n\"After the funeral, my husband wanted me to get a loaf of bread in the market,\" said Leach, \"and I went in and he was coming out of the market. But we weren't notified or anything.\"\n\n\"Standing there, staring down my mother,\" added Nicholas.\n\nThe suspect was later convicted. He died in prison while serving his sentence.\n\nThat might have been the end of the story except that years later, Henry Nicholas started a tech company called Broadcom and became a billionaire.\n\nIn 2008, Nicholas poured millions of dollars into a campaign for a California state constitutional amendment designed to make sure that moment outside the grocery store wouldn't happen to others. He called the initiative Marsy's Law.\n\nIt was adopted in California with 54% of the vote.\n\nSince then, Nicholas has marched to victory in five other states, convincing lawmakers and voters to rewrite their constitutions. Along the way he's spent more than $20 million.\n\nA spokesperson for Marsy's Law for All said Henry Nicholas wasn't available for an interview and that he prefers to \"stay behind the scenes.\"\n\nThe nationwide push for Marsy's Law is itself part of a broader movement, says Colin Miller, a law professor at the University of South Carolina. He says in recent decades, the victims' rights movement has led to things like victim impact statements and sex-offender registries.\n\n\"This started in the '70s a bit, then it got traction in the '80s\" with the campaign by the mother of Sharon Tate, said Miller. Tate had been killed by members of the so-called Manson Family and Tate's mother \"made the big push in California for victim impact statements and that really got the ball rolling.\"\n\nBut these efforts haven't been without their critics. The American Civil Liberties Union has argued Marsy's Law infringes on the presumption of innocence by granting rights to a victim before a defendant has been convicted of a crime.\n\nThe organization also takes issue with what it characterizes as an overly broad definition of \"victim\" in the amendment proposed for New Hampshire, as it includes victims of misdemeanor crimes where defendants are not entitled to legal counsel.\n\nThe Marsy's Law campaign says it expects to spend millions of dollars to support the amendment. But the idea that a California billionaire could lead the charge to amend the New Hampshire Constitution is also rubbing some local lawmakers the wrong way.\n\n\"It bothers me a lot,\" said Democratic state Rep. Marjorie Smith. She calls the whole thing a marketing effort that has little to do with New Hampshire.\n\n\"It is another example of how large concentrations of money can affect the outcome of an election or something like this that has very little to do with the merits,\" said Smith.\n\nA spokesperson for Marsy's Law in New Hampshire says critics focus on the process \"because they know they cannot win on the merits of the issue.\" The spokesperson also pointed out that many state groups, like the ACLU or labor unions, are supported by resources from national parent organizations.\n\nAmanda Grady Sexton, state director for the Marsy's Law campaign, disagrees with the argument that the amendment isn't a response to a local problem. Sexton has worked with the New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence since 2001 and says acquiring constitutional rights for crime victims has long been a goal for her organization.\n\nAn ad for the Ohio campaign. YouTube\n\n\"We recruited Marsy's Law to New Hampshire to help us to achieve that goal,\" said Sexton. \"And without those resources, we don't believe it would be possible. This is truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\"\n\nA version for South Dakota. YouTube\n\nThe campaign that Sexton recruited to New Hampshire is a well-oiled machine that has found success in other states, like South Dakota, with star-studded TV ad campaigns.\n\n\"They run $2 million of Kelsey Grammer in a TV ad and we get it,\" chuckled South Dakota House Speaker Mark Mickelson.\n\nAfter the amendment was passed in his state via a 2016 ballot initiative, Mickelson says county courts started complaining about an increase in administrative costs, to the tune of several million dollars. And the amendment has had other unintended consequences.\n\n\"I've got a woman whose husband was killed in a car accident in August of last year and she can't get the crime report from [the Department of] Public Safety because they're afraid to release the information,\" Mickelson said. \"They're not sure if there was a crime, and if there was, who the victim is.\"\n\nAfter negotiating a compromise earlier this year, Mickelson and the Marsy's Law South Dakota campaign are backing a second constitutional amendment to fix the issues with the first one.\n\nMickelson's advice to lawmakers here: \"just make sure that what you're putting into the constitution is something that you can live with for a long time.\"\n\nSo far, lawmakers in New Hampshire seem to be saying they can live with it for a long time. The state Senate passed the amendment by a vote of 20-3. The measure also boasts an impressive list of supporters, from the governor to legislative leaders in both parties.\n\nStill, Marsy's Law faces a steep road ahead in New Hampshire, which has a higher bar for constitutional amendments than most states: three-fifths approval from both chambers of the Legislature, followed by two-thirds approval from voters.\n\nGroups like the New Hampshire-ACLU meanwhile are gearing up with their own lobbyists to oppose the amendment \u2014 just like other ACLU chapters have done in some of those alternate universes.", "keywords": ["state", "nicholas", "pushing", "group", "victims", "campaign", "marsys", "law", "laws", "rights", "hampshire", "public", "amendment", "country"], "polarity": 0.08123449110598645, "subjectivity": 0.3927618980189071},
{"title": "The Line Becomes a River", "url": "https://www.npr.org/books/titles/582730044/the-line-becomes-a-river", "text": "Excerpt: The Line Becomes A River\n\nAt the station I was given the keys to a transport van and told to drive out to the reservation where two quitters had been seen wandering through the streets of a small village. When I arrived it was just after dark and I noticed few signs of life as I drove past the scattered homes, scanning for disheartened crossers. In the center of the village a small adobe church stood in an empty dirt lot, and I saw that the front door had been left ajar. I parked the van and left the headlights shining on the entrance. I walked to the heavy wooden door and leaned with all my weight to push it open, causing a loud and violent scraping to rise up and echo into the dim interior.\n\nInside the church, the light from my flashlight glinted off tiny strings of tinsel hanging from the ceiling. A large piece of fabric depicting the Virgin of Guadalupe was strung across the front wall, and beneath it I saw two figures lying on a blanket that had been spread out between the pews and the altar. As I approached, a man looked up at me and squinted, holding out his hand to block the light. We were resting a little, he said. It's just that we are lost, muy desanimados. A woman huddled close to him, hiding her face. The man propped himself up on one elbow and told me that they had crossed four days ago, that their guide had left them behind on the first night when they'd failed to keep pace with the group. They were lost for days, he said, with nothing to drink but the filthy water from cattle tanks. Puede ser muy fea la frontera, I told him. The man shook his head. Pues s\u00ed, he replied, pero es a\u00fan m\u00e1s feo donde nosotros vivimos.\n\nThe man told me that they came from Morelos. My wife and I, we're just coming to find work, he said. He rubbed his eyes in silence. I have fresh water for you, I told them. At the station there's juice and crackers. The man looked at me and smiled weakly, then asked for a minute to gather their belongings. He stuffed some things into a backpack, then helped his wife to her feet. Her face was streaked with dried tears, and when she turned toward me I saw that she was pregnant. How many months are you? I asked. The woman looked away and the man answered for her. Seis meses. He smiled. My wife speaks perfect English, he said, shouldering the backpack. He stopped in front of the altar, bowing his head and making the sign of the cross. I waited at the door as he mumbled a prayer. Gracias, he whispered. Gracias.\n\nOutside I looked at their faces in the glare of my headlights. The woman seemed young. Where did you learn English? I asked. Iowa, she told me quietly. I grew up there, she said, I even got my GED. She kept her head down and avoided my gaze as she talked, glancing up only briefly at my uniformed body. Why did you leave? I asked her. She told me that she had returned to Morelos to care for her younger siblings after their mother died. In Morelos I made some money teaching English at the kindergarten, she said, I even tutored the adults in my village, people preparing for the journey north. For a few seconds she seemed proud, and then she shook her head. But the money there, it isn't enough. She glanced up at her husband. It was my idea to cross, she said. I wanted our child to have a life here, like I did.\n\nThe man took a moment to look at me in the light. Listen, he said, do you think you could bring us back to Mexico, como hermano? You could drive us down to the border, he pleaded, you could just leave us there, all\u00ed en la l\u00ednea. Like a brother. I sighed and turned my head, squinting at the darkness beyond the church. I have to bring you in, I told him. It's my job. The man took a deep breath and nodded and then climbed into the back of the transport van, holding out his arms to help his pregnant wife.\n\nI gestured at a case of water bottles on the floor. You should drink, I told them. I grabbed the metal door of the cage and paused. What are your names? I asked. The man looked at me strangely and glanced at his wife. Then, as if it were nothing, they took turns introducing themselves. I repeated their names and I told them mine. Mucho gusto, I said. They replied with polite smiles. Igualmente. I turned my head and then bolted the cage and shut the door.\n\nIn the driver's seat I turned to look at the couple through the plexiglass. The man held his wife and gently whispered to her, cradling her head. Just before I started the engine I could hear the soft sound of her sobbing. As I drove through the unmarked streets of the village, trying to find my way to the highway, I felt for a moment that I had become lost. Beyond the last house, I saw a white dog in the darkness at the edge of my headlights, staring into the night.\n\nAt the station, I sorted through their things with them, discarding perishables and sharp objects. I had them remove their belts and their shoelaces and I tagged their backpacks and handed them a claim ticket. I counted and took note of their money, in pesos and in dollars, and then handed it back to them, telling them to keep it close. Inside the processing center I filled out their voluntary return papers and entered their names into the computer. Before leaving them in their cell I wished them luck on their journey and asked them to be safe, to always think of their child.\n\nLater that night, as I sat in the transport van listening to the calls come out over the radio, I realized I had forgotten their names.", "keywords": ["told", "turned", "man", "river", "van", "asked", "looked", "village", "line", "wife", "took", "head"], "polarity": 0.03761123136123136, "subjectivity": 0.3734547859547859},

The only caveat was that several justices suggested it would be better for Congress to deal with the problem instead of the court. After all, as the case came to the justices, they were going to have to apply current advanced technology to the Stored Communications Act, a law enacted in 1986, several years before email even became available for wide public use.\n\nAmazingly, just three weeks after the Supreme Court argument, lo and behold, a Congress famous for gridlock passed legislation to modernize the law.\n\nMicrosoft's weak hand\n\nFew except the cognoscenti knew the modernizing language was even there when Congress passed it last Friday. Titled the CLOUD Act (Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data), the statute was attached to the 2,232-page, $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill.\n\nHuzzah!!!!\n\nTo the expert's, as well as layperson's, eye, it looks as though the tech industry, sensing a debilitating loss in the Supreme Court, had a weak hand to play in negotiating with the Justice Department.\n\nWhen all is said and done, \"this looks like a serious win for the Justice Department,\" said Orin Kerr, a privacy expert at University of Southern California law school.\n\nOn Monday, the Trump administration took a first step toward getting the Microsoft case dismissed. In a letter to the Supreme Court, Solicitor General Noel Francisco informed the justices that the administration intends to file a new brief addressing \"to what extent\" passage of the CLOUD Act nullifies the Microsoft case as a live controversy.\n\nWhile the CLOUD Act does not, in fact, give Microsoft much to be happy about, it does give the tech industry a couple of victories. The first is in the area of public relations. The industry can portray itself as having fought to protect its customers' privacy. Second, until passage of the new statute, foreign countries were threatening to send tech company employees to jail if they complied with U.S. warrants. Now the legal lay of the land is much clearer.\n\nWho's in the club?\n\nThe language of the CLOUD Act is designed to provide incentives for governments to make one-on-one agreements with the U.S., agreements that allow tech companies to honor court-approved search warrants.\n\nExperts say it is expected that the U.S. will only make such \"bilateral agreements\" with countries that have legal systems similar to those in the United States. Think of these bilateral agreements as a club that admits only those countries that the U.S. Justice Department wants to admit.\n\nIf a country is not in the club, Microsoft and similar tech companies would be out of luck. They would have to comply with a court-ordered U.S. warrant. Period. Also warrants from state and local law enforcement.\n\nIf a country \u2014 let's say France \u2014 is in the club, a company like Microsoft could alert French authorities if the company reasonably believes there is a conflict with French law, and the warrant could then be challenged in court. Sort of a legal triple play.\n\nThere are, however, precious few exceptions in the law that in practice would end up invalidating these warrants, which is why many civil liberties and human rights groups opposed the CLOUD Act.\n\nChris Calabrese, vice president of the Center for Democracy and Technology, one of those opposition groups, notes that the model for the bilateral agreements that the CLOUD Act encourages is an existing agreement between the U.S. and the United Kingdom.\n\nSo what is in that agreement?\n\nAccording to Calabrese, it is secret.", "keywords": ["warrant", "sink", "cloud", "technology", "tech", "major", "court", "law", "privacy", "supreme", "act", "microsoft", "haystack", "needle", "legal", "agreements", "case"], "polarity": 0.09611897665176355, "subjectivity": 0.38935668156979636},

Bradley Byrne of Alabama \u2014 himself a former employment law lawyer \u2014 told NPR in January.\n\nFiling an official complaint about harassment on the Hill involves a multistep dispute resolution process that can stretch out for months, as described on the congressional Office of Compliance website. A staffer must first request counseling and that counseling period \"normally lasts for 30 days,\" according to the Office of Compliance. Then, the staffer must request mediation, which also usually lasts 30 days. If that mediation doesn't resolve things, the staffer then can proceed with a lawsuit or have an administrative hearing, but can only do so 30 to 90 days after the mediation ends.\n\nIn addition, taxpayer dollars have funded settlements to staffers complaining of harassment. The Washington Post reported in December that the Treasury has spent $174,000 on settling harassment-related claims over the last five years. In February, the House unanimously passed a measure that would overhaul the Congressional Accountability Act. That bill would ensure that lawmakers who harass employees pay for settlements out of their own pockets, and it would also simplify the complaint process.\n\nThough that bill enjoyed bipartisan support in the House, passing via a voice vote, the Senate has not taken it up yet.\n\nBelow, read the full text of the senators' letter:", "keywords": ["harassment", "address", "22", "senate", "senators", "sexual", "staffer", "women", "hill", "mediation", "process", "passed", "house"], "polarity": 0.15108695652173915, "subjectivity": 0.5634057971014493},

Heller, which determined the Second Amendment allowed an individual right to bear arms. Stevens says he remains convinced that decision was wrong and debatable and provided the National Rifle Association with \"a propaganda weapon of immense power.\"\n\nStevens' call for repeal of the Second Amendment goes further than most gun control advocates, many of whom have called for banning certain types of weapons and establishing stricter background checks and age limits but for not changing the Constitution.\n\nStevens' proposal immediately lit up Twitter and social media.\n\nAt least one of the Parkland, Fla., students, Cameron Kasky, reacted to Stevens' op-ed arguing it was \"very interesting considering who wrote it,\" but \"I don't feel the same way.\"\n\nA mass shooting last month at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland left 17 people dead and is the catalyst for the \"March for Our Lives\" movement.\n\nWhile Stevens claimed such an action would \"be simple,\" it likely would be anything but.

One of her opponents, Joseph Kopser, raised $774,000, but she came in first in the Democratic primary for the 21st Congressional District near Austin and San Antonio.\n\nNot only did she outdo Kopser, whom she will face in a May runoff, but Wilson also defeated two other men who had much larger campaign war chests than she did.\n\nIt just so happens that Wilson did all this in a year when female candidates have energized Democratic voters. So did being a woman help Wilson?\n\nShe says yes.\n\n\"If I would have thought about doing this 10 years ago, I don't think I would have been as successful as I was on Election Day this year,\" she said. \"There's something about this time and this wave of emotion and resistance and frustration that have prompted women to get into the political arena in ways we haven't in the past.\"\n\nWilson stresses that she did well in the primary for a variety of reasons. Voters like how she talks about politics as being about \"this very simplistic and almost idealistic idea that we should take care of one another,\" she said. She has enthusiastic volunteers. Voters like her experience in both education \u2014 she used to be a math professor \u2014 and the ministry.\n\nBut she also acknowledges that her gender played a part.\n\n\"I think being female helped me take first place,\" she said. \"I don't think that's the only thing that got me into the runoff, though.\"\n\nBut still, her comments raise the question: Do women running for office have an advantage this year?\n\nThe answer appears to be yes, but as with all things related to identity and politics, it's complicated. Pollsters say women have distinct advantages this year\u2014 and many voters may not even realize how much gender affects their opinions of candidates.\n\nBeing a woman helps, depending on the party\n\n\"In all this cacophony and chaos women are grabbing people's attention, they communicate change, and they mobilize more peripheral women voters who tend to support women candidates,\" said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake.\n\nWomen can grab attention, in part, because they're still not that common among candidates. Even with this year's wave of women, they're still far outnumbered by men.\n\nAs of January, women made up around 23 percent of both House and Senate candidates this year, only up slightly from 19 and 18 percent for those chambers at the same point in the 2016 cycle. By comparison, women routinely make up more than half of voters.\n\nBecause they don't fit the mold of the typical politician, women candidates communicate change to voters, Lake said.\n\nThat tends to benefit Democrats in particular: With Republicans controlling Congress and a majority of state legislatures, Democrats are the ones who want more change.\n\n\"In the 14th district, our community has never elected a woman to Congress, ever,\" said Lauren Underwood, a Democrat running for Congress in Illinois. \"The only people that have ever come out of our district are middle-aged, white men. And so I think that there's just an interest in having a different voice represent our community now. And the fact that I am a millennial woman of color is very different.\"\n\nBut then, it's far more complicated than identity, she adds. Voters may be energized by a candidate who looks different, but they tell Underwood that they really want substantial policy change.\n\n\"If I was a woman who had a values misalignments with my community, I wouldn't be successful,\" she said. \"But I do think that my interests and goals in public service are very well suited to this moment, and it's my community.\"\n\nWomen candidates will also tend to energize younger and single women, Lake said \u2014 constituencies that tend to be more Democratic, but who don't always show up for midterm elections.\n\nOn top of all that, there is one more, massive partisan difference at play.\n\n\"There is a very big difference between the attitudes of Democrats and Republicans on the importance of electing more women candidates,\" said Republican pollster Christine Matthews. \"And for Democrats it's just a significantly higher priority.\"\n\nShe points to a January poll from CBS News found that 84 percent of Democratic women think that \"more women in political office would make the country better,\" compared to 19 percent of Republican women. (CBS did not report the results broken out by men and party.)\n\nFor her part, Wilson says she has heard from women voters who say it's important to them to see other women in office.\n\n\"There are women in their fifties like me saying, 'I want to vote for you because I finally hear someone who sounds like me,'\" Wilson said.\n\nWith the massive wave of women running or preparing to run for office, it's possible that women will hit record levels of representation in Congress, especially if voters are indeed more energized to vote for women this year. In addition, it could set the stage for greater racial diversity in office as well; Alabama has a record number of black women running for office, and Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams could become the first black woman governor.\n\nVoters think of female candidates differently\n\nRegardless of party, however, voters treat women and men differently on a number of fronts \u2014 for example, ascribing different policy strengths to candidates based on gender, as a 2017 study found.\n\n\"We found that, in our research, Democratic women candidates amplify traditional Democratic advantages on issues like health care and education,\" said Amanda Hunter, communications director at the nonprofit Barbara Lee Family Foundation, which conducted that study. \"However, they're still weak on traditionally weak [Democratic] issues like the economy and national security.\"\n\n\"Republican women candidates make up ground on traditionally challenging areas for women candidates like national security, but remain weak on areas like health care \u2014 but still fare better on health care than Republican male candidates,\" she added.\n\nWith health care emerging as a major issue in the 2018 elections, this could boost women candidates on both sides of the aisle, then, as voters who care intensely about the topic could easily trust women candidates more than their counterparts who are men.\n\n\"It is the one issue where men will say, 'Well, my mom, my spouse, my sister, my girlfriend tell me when to go to the doctor, which plan we're going to be on,'\" Lake said.\n\nWomen are always treated differently\n\nTo the degree that women do have some sort of an advantage this year, it doesn't come on top of a totally level playing field. Studies have shown a variety of different effects that candidate gender has on voters.\n\nThere's the study from Barbara Lee that showed gendered differences on policy topics. And other research from the foundation has found that women candidates have to work harder not only to prove their qualifications, but to be likable to voters.\n\n\"The women who decide to throw their hat in the ring are supremely qualified and tend to be more politically driven and ambitious,\" said Victoria De Francesco Soto, a professor of political science at the University of Texas Austin.\n\nThis phenomenon is called \"sex selection theory.\" And Soto says it is stronger for some groups of women.\n\n\"When we see women of color run it's essentially the sex selection theory on steroids\" \u2014 by which she means, those women tend to show up with still more qualifications under their belts.\n\nControlling for candidate quality, one 2011 study found, shows that women operate at a disadvantage to men, all else being equal.\n\nThen again, one 2014 study found that while gender stereotypes may affect voters' perceptions of candidates, those stereotypes ultimately have little effect on women's abilities to win votes.\n\nOne thing that does seem to be true is that party is by far more important to voters than gender.\n\n\"Ninety percent of the vote is determined by party identification,\" Lake said, \"but in all of these close elections, that 10 percent margin can make a difference.\"\n\nSome voters do consciously weigh gender in choosing a candidate. Other voters reflexively reject the idea of considering a candidate's identity (consider the debates over \"voting with my vagina\" in the 2016 election cycle).\n\nBut gender may affect many voters who don't even realize it.\n\n\"They don't store it that way, but then when you ask, 'Why did you vote for Susie Smith?' they'll say, 'She was in touch with my life. She was really exciting. She represented change,'\" Lake explained. \"And there are a lot of women voters in particular who are just going to do a hail Mary for change.\"\n\nWilson says that she knows Democratic voters are excited about women, but that she doesn't want her gender to play too heavily into their choices.\n\n\"One of the things I say on the campaign trail is, 'I don't want you to vote for me simply because I'm a woman,'\" Wilson said. \"'I want you to vote for me because I'm a qualified female candidate, and we need more qualified women in Congress.'\"", "keywords": ["think", "woman", "democratic", "wilson", "gender", "women", "advantage", "candidates", "dont", "vote", "2018", "voters"], "polarity": 0.1323667073667074, "subjectivity": 0.5283312983312983},

Scott Walker is locked in a battle with prominent Democrats over Walker's refusal to call elections for two vacant state legislative districts.\n\nWalker faces a court-ordered deadline of Thursday to call elections for the seats, which opened in December when the officeholders resigned to take jobs in the governor's administration.\n\nVoters in both districts sued Walker with the help of a group led by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. So far, they've won.\n\nWalker has been admonished by two state circuit court judges for dragging his feet and, in their view, violating a state law that requires Wisconsin governors to call special elections for vacancies \"as promptly as possible.\"\n\nRepublicans control the governor's office, Legislature and state attorney general's office.

They moved to change the special election law \u2014 and make it retroactive.\n\nThe bill they could pass as soon as next week would apply regardless of any existing court orders. It would also lead to longer legislative vacancies.\n\nWalker said he would sign the measure, arguing that elections in these districts could wait until November because Wisconsin's Legislature has already finished its work for 2018.\n\n\"It's a waste of taxpayer's money,\" Walker told reporters Tuesday. \"And it's one of those where I think outside groups like Eric Holder's are really trying to push it to raise money and draw political attention to Wisconsin.\"\n\nFlorida Gov.

Niess rejected the move.\n\n\"I am not ruling on what the law might be in the future,\" Niess said Tuesday. \"I am enforcing the law as it is now.\"\n\nDemocrats contend Walker is dragging his feet because Republicans fear losing the seats. When Wisconsin last held special elections in January, Democrats won a surprise victory in a state Senate seat in an area that Donald Trump carried by 17 percentage points.\n\n\"Gov. Walker and legislative Republicans are so desperate to maintain their grip on power that they are changing laws to silence voters,\" said Jennifer Shilling, a Democrat from western Wisconsin who leads the minority in the state Senate. \"The Republican-led efforts to prevent court-ordered special elections from being held is the height of corruption and the public should not accept this abuse of power.\"\n\nJudge Josann Reynolds, who issued the initial order last week, said at the time that Walker had a \"plain and positive\" duty to call elections in these districts.\n\nReynolds noted in her ruling that while the Legislature's regular 2018 session had ended, Walker had a history of calling lawmakers back into special session to debate specific issues.\n\nThe most recent example happened just this month when Walker called a special session to address school safety bills, and Reynolds said it was \"very conceivable\" that the Legislature would have to come back into session later this year to address a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in Wisconsin's landmark redistricting case.\n\nEven if Republicans were to lose these seats \u2014 which is hardly a given \u2014 they would still hold an 18-15 majority in the Wisconsin Senate and a 63-36 majority in the Wisconsin Assembly.\n\nBut plaintiffs who brought the lawsuit to force these elections say there's more at play here than just partisan politics.\n\n\"Why shouldn't we have a state senator?\" asked Alvin Meyer, who lives northeast of Green Bay in one of the vacant districts. \"Somebody resigns, quits, or dies, you fill the job.

The fiscal behemoth suddenly appeared at midweek and astonishingly became law less than 48 hours later.\n\nIt was Wednesday when leaders in Congress lifted the veil on the spending bill, knowing that few would be able to examine it in all its 2,200 pages of glory before the vote came on Thursday.\n\nThey knew that very few citizens, news people or members of Congress would manage to read what members would be voting for just ahead of their getaway planned for Friday. (Congress is now on break until April 9.)\n\nAll this might have slid by under the cover of other, juicier news. But the nation whiplashed back to attention when President Trump tweeted Friday morning that he was considering a veto of this latest, vast and lavish spending bill. Among other objections, he said no one had read it yet. And indeed, few had.\n\nBut less than four hours later Trump summoned the cameras to explain why he had gone ahead and signed the bill after all \u2014 with no changes. It turned out he had done the signing earlier, shortly after sending that veto threat via tweet.\n\nMany of the president's most ardent supporters were taken by surprise. Not a few felt betrayed.\n\n(\"Stabbing me in the back!\" shouted Rush Limbaugh from atop the conservative talk radio world as he watched the president's news availability. Limbaugh had assured listeners the day before that Trump could not and would not sign the spending bill.)\n\nSo if any or all of this prompted questions in your mind, here are some first attempts at answers.\n\n1. Does Congress really vote on big, important bills without reading them?\n\nShort answer: Yes, it does so routinely, and for several reasons. First, ask yourself, when was the last time you read anything 2,200 pages long? If you ever did so, was the text in plain English or in \"statutory language\" full of coded references to sections of the U.S. code of laws? Would you read that many pages yourself if there was a summary available, one that could be read and interpreted by a member of your staff? And even if you wanted to read all 2,200 pages yourself, could you do it overnight?\n\nA longer answer: Members have complained for years about leaders' stratagem of forcing a snap decision on yes-or-no in the eleventh hour, even on the most consequential legislation. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has been among those saying the law should mandate a reading period before voting on big spending bills. Advocacy groups on the left and right have agreed: Congress should not rubber-stamp bills sight unseen.\n\nBack in 2009, one of the Senate Democrats fashioning what became the Affordable Care Act had to admit he had not read all the \"statutory language\" it contained. Some of his constituents were outraged, but the senator said such objections were misplaced. Just before Christmas last year, it was the Democrats protesting the rapid sequence of rollout-to-roll call for the Republican tax cut bill.\n\n2. Why wasn't there more time for reading and debate?\n\nShort answer: Because March 23 was the deadline for a new spending bill, a deadline specified in the last, stopgap bill back in February. Without a new bill to keep the dollars flowing, the government would have shut down \u2014 at least partially \u2014 at midnight Friday night.\n\nTo avoid this, leaders from both parties in both the House and Senate have been working for weeks on this major set of compromises, the broad outlines of which had been agreed to last month. The White House has been represented throughout the talks by the likes of legislative director Marc Short and the emissaries of Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney. All sides did not reach the final agreement until this past week, and they did not have a product they could show their colleagues in Congress until Wednesday. At that point, there were bound to be objections on the basis of process, on the basis of policy, and on issues of secrecy versus transparency in governing.\n\n3. Why is the bill so all-encompassing and the bottom line so enormous?\n\nThis bill basically flashes the green light for spending on all the discretionary functions of the federal government, which means everything except entitlements (Social Security, military and other pensions, and the interest payments on the national debt). That covers a lot of government for a whole fiscal year.\n\nThe bottom line in dollars was a mind-boggling record, in part because President Trump demanded and got the biggest increase in defense spending in 15 years. Also escalating the price tag was the Democrats' insistence on rough parity for spending increases for domestic programs as well.\n\nAll this new spending is, of course, entirely debt-financed. That is because previous spending levels were already higher than revenues and because the recent tax cut bill further widened that gap by reducing those revenues. The next budget's deficit will be in the neighborhood of $1 trillion for a single year.\n\nWhile this is apparently no longer anathema to the Republican Party leadership, in Congress or the White House, it remains deeply disturbing to individual members and to anti-debt conservatives everywhere.\n\n4. Why is all this being done right now?\n\nShort answer: It's a gargantuan do-over. Because Congress didn't do the spending process back when it was supposed to by law back in 2017. The House and Senate are required by statute to each pass 12 bills appropriating the money for all discretionary spending. They are supposed to work out the differences between their respective versions and present them to the president for him to sign them into law. That did not happen in 2017 for a variety of reasons. Since then the government has remained open via a series of stopgap spending bills called \"continuing resolutions.\"\n\nThe latest action is not much more than an ongoing set of orders, but at least it gets us through the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. That means the whole appropriations process (the statutory process for spending Uncle Sam's money) has to be struggled through again for the next fiscal year.\n\nNPR via YouTube\n\n5. Has anything like this ever happened before?\n\nSadly, yes. And something very much like it may happen again very soon. Back in 1988, President Ronald Reagan dropped a 42-pound pile of paper on the speaker's lectern as he began his State of the Union speech. He said he would never sign such a bloated, omnibus spending bill again. The president was frustrated because his party did not control either chamber of Congress and had trouble negotiating with the Democrats. Appropriations would break down and at least some of the spending bills would be lumped together in an omnibus.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Bob Daugherty /AP Bob Daugherty /AP\n\nOn another occasion, Reagan had his staff stack all the pages on a hand truck for purposes of a news conference where he denounced the process. At that news conference, Reagan complained about not having line-item-veto power as president the way most governors did. Does any of this sound familiar?\n\nIn fairness, Congress did step back from the constant confrontation for a time after that. From 1987 through 1994, the Democratic Congress managed the traditional process without the need for an omnibus in all but two budget cycles.\n\nBut in the mid-1990s, the budget battles intensified again, this time between a Democratic president (Bill Clinton) and a Republican Congress. From 1995 through 2005, the omnibus had to be rolled out in seven years out of nine because the regular order for spending bills had fallen short.\n\n6. Trump says he won't ever sign a bill like this again. Does he mean it?\n\nIn a sense he surely means it. No one would want to be jammed on a major move such as this with so little time to maneuver. On other kinds of legislation, he could let Congress leave town and confront the issue when it came back. But if you have one monster bill funding the government, the veto option becomes the government shutdown option. And that set of choices could well recur the next time the deep divisions in Congress frustrate the \"regular order\" of the spending process and result in an omnibus.\n\nNPR via YouTube\n\n7. Why wasn't a veto an option?\n\nA veto was an option, but it would mean shutting the government down. That's what happened in 1995 and 1996 when a feisty Republican Congress passed a big package of spending cuts knowing President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, did not want to accept it. Clinton used his veto, and the government shut down \u2014 the second time for weeks. Blame for the impasse seemed to settle on Congress, at least in the polls. Since then, presidents have been reluctant to force the issue if a veto meant a shutdown.\n\n8. What's wrong with Trump calling for a line-item veto?\n\nThe president can surely call for a line-item veto. Presidents regularly did so for decades. It would enable them to \"line out\" a single item in the budget the way most governors can do. But 20 years ago the issue reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which decided that such a power would violate the Constitution's view of the power of the purse. That put an end to the discussion. Of course, you could always change the Constitution. That only takes two-thirds in the House and in the Senate and ratification by three-fourths of the states. That's only happened once for a newly written amendment in the past 50 years.\n\n9. Why shouldn't Trump call for an end to the filibuster?\n\nThe filibuster is a feature of the Senate and tolerated under Senate rules. It extends debate indefinitely, killing the bill. It takes 60 votes to end a filibuster. That means the minority party (currently the Democrats) can actually prevail in crucial situations. In recent years, both parties have moved to limit the filibuster to legislation (excluding the confirmation of presidential appointments). But both parties have also rejected ending the filibuster for legislation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says there are no Republican votes for ending the filibuster on legislation. Spending bills are legislation.\n\nNPR via YouTube\n\n10. Is this any way to run a railroad?\n\nIf anyone thinks so, that someone is keeping it a secret.\n\nAnd it's not the way Congress is supposed to spend money, either. The way it's supposed to work is an orderly process of considering a dozen separate and distinct \"appropriations bills\" that cover all discretionary spending (as opposed to entitlement payments to Social Security recipients and others).\n\nInstead, in its times of duress, Congress falls back on a massive bill appropriating enormous amount of money for a vast array of agencies and programs. Inevitably, some of those outlays are more popular than others, reviled by some and revered by others. But all have some form of constituency that has some form of power.\n\nNo one member is responsible for everything in the bill, but there is always at least one someone whose fingerprints are on each individual item (usually lots of someones).\n\nSo someone is getting credit for each spending decision of \"yes.\" At the same time, when every \"yes\" decision has been aggregated in an amalgam of legislation, it becomes next to impossible to fix individual blame for the overall dollar result of all those yeses.\n\nAnd so the dollar totals continue to mount.", "keywords": ["bills", "veto", "bill", "drive", "senate", "spending", "questions", "congress", "president", "way", "omnibus", "happened", "trump", "process", "read"], "polarity": 0.012132459044223755, "subjectivity": 0.3771093759181995},

Cris Dush is the lawmaker behind the impeachment push. He is specifically taking issue with the fact that after invalidating the map, the court called for it to be redrawn in time for the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nJustices gave lawmakers three weeks to fix it but didn't provide their full opinion until two days before the deadline.\n\nAccording to Dush, four of the court's five Democrats \"stripped the people of the commonwealth of their sovereign right; they have stripped the legislature ... of their sovereign authority to write legislation, and they have absolutely no power or authority under the constitution to do so.\"\n\nDush has not introduced a resolution for the court's fifth Democrat, Max Baer, because Baer didn't want to redraw the congressional map so quickly even though the justice also thought the 2011 boundaries were unconstitutional.\n\nDush first circulated his plan in early February. GOP leaders in the House were at first reluctant to talk about it, citing the fact that they hadn't discussed the matter as a caucus, but the idea found support among a number of lawmakers in the General Assembly. And in a press conference soon after the court's decision, Republican U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey said impeachment of justices was \"a conversation that has to happen.\"\n\nBut late Thursday, House Republican Leader Dave Reed released a statement indicating the proposal won't get far.\n\nWhile he believes \"the state Supreme Court's decision to draw and implement their own congressional redistricting map is wrong,\" he said, \"disagreement over the outcome of any particular case should not be grounds for impeachment.\"\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court and another federal court declined to intervene in the case, letting the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision stand.\n\nThe justices' congressional map, released about a month ago, was drawn by Stanford professor Nathan Persily, who has contracted with a number of states to draw nonpartisan maps.\n\nIt is set to take effect for the May 15 primary election.\n\nThe new district lines are totally reshaped and renumbered, and they significantly improve Democrats' prospects.

She was working 12-hour days.\n\n\"Food was delivered; dinner was often delivered,\" Ralph says. \"Anything I could get sent to my house with little effort \u2014 the better.\"\n\nRalph ordered a three-month supply of pills via the app of a San Francisco-based company called NURX. It's one of several digital ventures, including Maven and Lemonaid Health, that now provide several types of hormonal contraception without requiring a live visit to a doctor or other health care provider.\n\nWomen using these services in cities say they like the speed and no-hassle privacy they get by making a purchase through the app. And in some rural areas where women's health clinics are few and far between, being able to buy prescription contraceptives online \u2014 starting at around $15 for a month's supply \u2014 can be not only much more private, but much more affordable and less time-consuming than driving an hour or more to the closest clinic, or paying for a doctor's appointment.\n\nNURX is now available in 18 states. It's popular in Texas, where many women live in what some health policy analysts call \"contraception deserts\" \u2014 places that lack easy access to women's health services.\n\nThe company's process is pretty simple. After users log in to the NURX app, they fill out a questionnaire.\n\n\"They tell us about their medical history,\" says Jessica Horowitz, a nurse practitioner with NURX who consults with patients via online chats. \"They give us a blood-pressure check.\"\n\nA clinician like Horowitz then reviews the answers and, based on that, makes a suggestion about what type of hormonal contraception might be best for that individual; a pill, a ring or a patch are available, as well as emergency contraception. If the patient has a question about the product she's considering, she can send an instant message or call to chat with a provider.\n\n\"It doesn't matter what time of day it is,\" Horowitz says. \"Someone responds.\"\n\nThen NURX sends a prescription to a pharmacy and the drugs are mailed out via priority mail, or faster for emergency contraception. The cost of a month's supply of prescription birth control is often free to patients, if they have health insurance, Horowitz says, and otherwise starts at $15 out-of-pocket for a month's supply, depending on the brand.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Maryam Fikri/NURX Courtesy of Maryam Fikri/NURX\n\nFor Claire Hammons, who lives and works in Llano, Texas, about 90 minutes outside Austin, the low cost of the pills was as important as the convenience.\n\nHammons loves many aspects of life in her small town. \"There is a population of 3,000 people,\" she says. \"But we have a lot going on. We are a huge art town. We have the Llano River. We are surrounded by state parks.\"\n\nStill, living there has its drawbacks, she says. There's no women's health clinic nearby, and getting prescription contraceptives isn't easy, especially without health insurance. And for Hammons, the main medicine she needs is birth control pills.\n\n\"I've been taking birth control since I was 16 because of endometriosis,\" she explains.\n\nIf she can't get the pills, Hammons is in a lot of pain every month. A while back, after losing her health plan, Hammons had a particularly hard time getting a prescription. Her out-of-pocket cost for a doctor's visit in Llano would have been $140.\n\n\"I really did not have \u2014 literally \u2014 have the money to go to the doctor. Period,\" she says.\n\nHammons says she also couldn't afford to pay out of pocket to pick up the pills every month at a pharmacy.\n\nThen, about six months ago, she went online and found NURX. The cost-savings, she says, was \"really amazing and ... saved me a lot.\"\n\nTexas has become a big market for the app. Dr. Brook Randal, an emergency medicine physician in Austin who works as a provider for NURX, says her patients come from different backgrounds and use the app for different reasons.\n\n\"A lot of them are low-income women who may not have a low-cost clinic available to them in the communities where they live,\" she says. \"And so we provide an important service for those women.\"\n\nIn 2013, the state passed an abortion bill that led half of all Texas clinics that performed abortions to close \u2014 clinics that often also provided birth control and other medical services to low-income women.\n\n\"Many of those women will tell us that they would have had to drive a really long distance in order to get to a clinic where they can get birth control economically,\" Randal says.\n\nAnd their access to birth control got even worse when Texas lawmakers cut funding for the state's family planning program, says Stacey Pogue, a health policy analyst with the Center for Public Policy Priorities in Austin. The cuts came at a time when the state's population was growing and more women were seeking services, Pogue notes.\n\n\"The ability of our safety net system to meet those needs and deliver health care \u2014 to actually get health care to women who are looking for contraceptives and well-woman exams \u2014 that has certainly been diminished,\" she says.\n\nApps like NURX that give women access to at least some types of contraceptives are definitely helpful, she says. But they aren't a comprehensive solution.\n\nSome of the most effective types of birth control \u2014 IUDs and implants \u2014 aren't available through the apps, Pogue notes, because they require a visit to a health provider. And apps will never substitute for the missing medical clinics \u2014 places where, beyond contraception, women could also get life-saving services, such as pap smears, breast exams and cervical cancer screenings.\n\nTexas is one of two states (Indiana is the other) where minors can't buy prescription birth control through NURX because of laws restricting minors' access to contraception.\n\nLesley McClurg covers mental health and consumer health stories for KQED in San Francisco, Calif.

It was 6:15, and LBJ was only in the sixth full day of his presidency. \"Tonight, on this Thanksgiving, I come before you to ask your help, to ask your strength, to ask your prayers that God may guard this Republic and guide my every labor,\" he began. \"All of us have lived through 7 days that none of us will ever forget. We are not given the divine wisdom to answer why this has been, but we are given the human duty of determining what is to be, what is to be for America, for the world, for the cause we lead, for all the hopes that live in our hearts.\" Reading with deliberate care from a prepared text, the president acknowledged what was surely on every American's mind: \"A great leader is dead; a great Nation must move on. Yesterday is not ours to recover, but tomorrow is ours to win or to lose.\"\n\nThe day before, LBJ had delivered his first speech before a joint session of Congress-a solemn and widely acclaimed address in which the new president pledged to pick up the mantle from John F. Kennedy and secure passage of the New Frontier's sweeping but stalled policy agenda, including a major tax cut that Kennedy's advisers believed would stimulate the economy; aid to primary and secondary education; and hospital care for seniors. Dozens of LBJ's former colleagues from Dixie sat in stone-cold silence as Johnson affirmed to stirring applause that \"no memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy's memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long. We have talked long enough in this country about equal rights. We have talked for one hundred years or more. It is time now to write the next chapter, and to write it in the books of law.\"\n\nNow, on Thanksgiving, Johnson doubled down, asking his countrymen to join him in prayer \"for His divine wisdom in banishing from our land any injustice or intolerance or oppression to any of our fellow Americans whatever their opinion, whatever the color of their skins\u2014for God made all of us, not some of us, in His image. All of us, not just some of us, are His children.\"\n\nFor most Americans, Thanksgiving week marked the start of the holiday season. For Lyndon Johnson, it signaled the beginning of an intense, yearlong sprint to prove that he could break the logjam, achieve the New Frontier, and surpass it beyond even the wildest expectations of John Kennedy's supporters. It would be no easy lift.\n\n\"I think the Congress looks more powerful sitting here than it did when I was there in the Congress,\" Kennedy remarked roughly a year before his death. For well over two decades, a coalition of conservative southern Democrats and northern Republicans had stymied the expansion of domestic policies first established during the New Deal era. In the Senate, an institution that the journalist William White once dubbed \"the South's unending revenge upon the North for Gettysburg,\" conservatives made frequent use of the filibuster to prevent social welfare and civil rights legislation from coming to a vote, while in the House powerful southerners kept such measures forever bottled up in committee. Now, in a sharp rebuke to Kennedy's promise of dynamic action and national rejuvenation, the conservative coalition had all but ground the government to a halt. Not only did the House and the Senate refuse to take up key New Frontier measures. They also refused to pass eight of twelve routine appropriations bills, thus leaving whole parts of the government unfunded and operating on a continuing resolution that set spending at the previous year's levels.\n\nCongressional Quarterly deemed the state of affairs \"unprecedented,\" while Walter Lippmann, the dean of American journalism, bemoaned the \"scandal of drift and inefficiency\" that had beset Washington. \"This Congress has gone further than any other within memory to replace debate and decision by delay and stultification. This is one of those moments when there is reason to wonder whether the congressional system as it now operates is not a grave danger to the Republic.\" Yet as Harry Truman famously asserted, the buck stopped with the president. A week before Kennedy's assassination, the columnist James Reston noted \"a vague feeling of doubt and disappointment about President Kennedy's first term. . . . He has touched the intellect of the country, but not its heart. He has informed but not inspired the nation. He is the most popular figure, but he has been lucky in his competition. . . . [H]is problem is probably not how to get elected but how to govern.\"\n\nSuch was the state of affairs when Lyndon Johnson entered the White House.\n\nLBJ first came to Washington as a young congressional staff member in the early 1930s before returning to Texas in 1935 to serve as state director of the National Youth Administration (NYA), a marquee New Deal jobs project. Two years later, and against all odds, he won a special election to Congress at age twenty-eight. An ardent supporter of Franklin Roosevelt, Johnson established a more liberal voting record than most southern Democrats with whom he served in the House. Though he consistently opposed legislation to abolish the poll tax and to make lynching a federal crime, he joined northern Democrats in supporting expanded rights for organized labor, greater administrative oversight of business and industry, and funding for public works. Notably, he continued to do so long after most of his southern Democratic colleagues forged an informal alliance with northern Republicans to oppose the Roosevelt administration. On the strength of his New Deal credentials, FDR strongly backed Johnson in a special election to fill an unexpired Senate seat in 1941. LBJ most likely won the primary (in Texas, as throughout the South, the only vote that mattered), but party rivals stole it from him in a brazen display of election-night ballot fraud. Though in the coming years he aligned himself more closely with his state's oil and gas interests, when he ran a second time for the Senate in 1948, Johnson was once again recognized as the liberal option. After achieving a razor-thin primary victory over the conservative former governor Coke Stevenson-this time, it was likely LBJs allies who stole the election-Johnson drifted rightward during his two terms in the Senate, in part out of recognition that Texas was moving strongly in that direction and in part to curry favor with the chamber's powerful southern chairmen, most notably Richard Brevard Russell of Georgia. Johnson delivered his maiden floor speech in opposition to civil rights, turned against former New Deal allies who now stood accused of communist loyalty, and, in his time as Democratic leader after 1953, cooperated closely with the Eisenhower administration. Many of the liberals in his caucus came to despise LBJ, particularly after he neutered their civil rights bill in 1957. They correctly perceived that he wanted to pass a weak bill in order to make his prospective presidential candidacy in 1960 palatable to northern Democrats but unobjectionable to his fellow southerners. On the day that he assumed office, very few people knew what to make of Lyndon Johnson. Was he simply a pragmatist who, deep in his heart, remained an ardent New Dealer? Or was he a southern conservative who would betray John Kennedy's unfinished legacy?\n\nIf Johnson's belief system was a matter of wide speculation, few observers doubted his keen understanding of Congress. LBJ knew that conservative Democrats, in loose cooperation with Republicans, had willfully manufactured a bottleneck of important legislation to form a bulwark against Kennedy's civil rights bill. Only when liberals capitulated and withdrew the Civil Rights Act would southern Democrats consent to bring Kennedy's tax stimulus to a vote and fund the many government initiatives-including bridges, highways, post offices, and defense projects-that their more liberal and moderate colleagues hoped to deliver to hometown constituents. Johnson knew the playbook because, as a freshman senator, he had helped to write it. As long as conservatives could hold the government hostage, much as they had in 1949, when they successfully fought back Harry Truman's civil rights agenda, they could forestall consideration of Kennedy's New Frontier agenda, including civil rights legislation that lay dying on the Hill.\n\nIt took LBJ less than a day to spring into action. In a series of phone calls before and after Thanksgiving 1963, the new president highlighted the imperative of using his political capital to clear the logjam; then, and only then, would members of Congress feel at liberty to bring civil rights and other New Frontier measures to a vote. In the meantime, however, he would keep up the pressure. On Saturday, November 30\u2014just over a week after assuming the presidency\u2014LBJ asked the former Treasury secretary Robert Anderson, a Republican and outspoken fiscal conservative, to intervene with Howard Smith, the chairman of the Rules Committee, which had broad authority to prevent legislation from proceeding to the House floor. Johnson reminded Anderson that \"this country is not in any condition to take that kind of stuff . . . and that's going to hurt our people. And it's going to hurt the conservatives.\" Anderson agreed to speak with Smith and to convey the president's willingness to support a seldom-used measure\u2014a discharge petition\u2014to bypass Smith's committee altogether and bring the legislation directly to the full House.\n\nPlaying the other side just as artfully, Johnson placed a call to Dave McDonald, the president of the United Steelworkers of America (USWA) and a member in good standing of the liberal coalition. \"They've got to petition it out,\" the president instructed. \"That means we got to get 219. We'll start at about 150 Democrats; that means we got to get 60, 70 Republicans.\" The president spoke with the passion of a true believer (\"we've been talking about this for 100 years. And they won't give us a hearing on this thing, so we got to do something about it\") and implored McDonald to fire up his union's formidable lobbying operation\u2014not only to support the discharge petition in the House, but also to move the tax and appropriations bills through committee.\n\nBefore and after the Thanksgiving holiday, Johnson repeated these conversations time and again, at once lining up support for a discharge petition in the House while affirming the need to clear the logjam of tax and spending bills before making a final push on civil rights in the Senate. Among those who understood the president's strategy was Senator George Smathers, a conservative Democrat from Florida who ultimately opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 but who represented a faction of the southern caucus that was disinclined to grind all government to a halt indefinitely over civil rights. The \"sooner we can get a civil rights bill over with,\" he told Johnson, \"get that part of it ended and out of the way, the better off the South's going to be, and the better off the North's going to be, and the better off everybody's going to be. And they wouldn't hide behind the tax bill\u2014and hide behind a lot of other bills, just on the pretense of being against them when the real fact is they're against the civil rights bill.\"\n\nWithout prompting\u2014and without the knowledge that LBJ had been making a similar case to his economic advisers for several days\u2014Smathers suggested that the president make a concerted effort to woo Harry F. Byrd, the deeply conservative chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. If Johnson were willing to indulge Byrd's obsession with fiscal discipline and bring the 1964-1965 federal budget under $100 billion, then the chairman might allow the tax cut to clear through his committee. \"Wish you'd feel Byrd out,\" LBJ agreed, \"and give me a pretty good, full report.\" Unknowingly, George Smathers would help set in motion a chain of events whose consequences would be far reaching.\n\nThe strategy that Lyndon Johnson developed in the first week of his presidency had a profound but highly calculated effect. The pressure that his supporters placed on Howard Smith\u2014and the chairman's realization that a discharge petition, if successful, would permanently undermine his authority\u2014persuaded the cantankerous Virginian to allow the Civil Rights Act to reach the House floor. Beginning with outreach from Smathers, LBJ simultaneously courted Harry Byrd until the patrician senator effectively agreed to swap budget cuts for a tax stimulus. With major economic legislation now cleared through Congress, the president had paved the way for passage of long-awaited civil rights legislation.\n\nJust before the Thanksgiving holiday, some of Johnson's advisers cautioned him that presidents should not spend valuable capital on hopeless causes. \"Well,\" he purportedly replied, \"what the hell's the presidency for?\"\n\nLBJ ultimately brought his budget under $100 billion, pushed Kennedy's tax cut through Congress, and secured passage of the Civil Rights Act-all by late June 1964. He accomplished these measures while also declaring an \"unconditional war on poverty\" and creating the blueprint for the Great Society\u2014the most ambitious domestic agenda since the New Deal. Though LBJ's early success owed in part to his mastery of legislative strategy, equally fundamental were efforts by advocacy groups-religious and lay alike-on behalf of civil rights and social justice legislation. Above all, Johnson benefited from a deep well of public support in the wake of Kennedy's assassination. The president's approval ratings, which fluctuated between 70 percent and 77 percent throughout the spring, owed at least as much to the country's determination to lock arms with its new leader as to LBJ's policy and political triumphs.\n\nUnlike most of his predecessors, LBJ did not enjoy the benefit of a transition period to build the team that would help him, in turn, build his vision. Instead, he had little choice but to improvise on the spot\u2014to pull a trusted friend like Jack Valenti along with him to the White House or entreat old hands from his House and Senate days to join him on a new and unfamiliar journey. These handicaps notwithstanding, in that first year of seemingly unrestrained activity and accomplishment\u2014from the time of Kennedy's death to his own election to the presidency in late 1964\u2014Johnson assembled an ad hoc staff that defied the expectations of even the most cynical Washington hands. They were a \"coalition government\" of Kennedy and Johnson men\u2014a \"strange amalgam of Austin and Boston, of cool, brainy Easterners and shrewd, folksy Texans, of men who had always been fiercely loyal to him and men who had fought and belittled him before the 1960 Los Angeles Democratic convention,\" according to Charles Roberts, who covered the White House for Newsweek. \"It is some kind of tribute to Isaiah and the LBJ Way that the transition went as smoothly as it did.\"", "keywords": ["great", "civil", "tax", "senate", "legislation", "building", "house", "president", "johnson", "rights", "kennedys", "lbj", "society"], "polarity": 0.15173983379725015, "subjectivity": 0.46541957112531274},

In exchange, South Korea will reduce its steel exports to the U.S. by about 30 percent from the level of recent years. South Korea has been the third-largest supplier of foreign steel to the U.S., behind Canada and Brazil.\n\n\"In the case of South Korea, this is absolutely a home run,\" Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro told NPR's Morning Edition. \"In lieu of tariffs on steel, we have a quota which is equal to only 70 percent of their shipments from the last few years, and this will be as effective as the tariffs, and preserve the integrity of the steel industry. So let's not talk about exemptions letting anybody out. Everybody understands as they negotiate with the United States that if they're let out of the tariffs, they will have a quota or some other similar restriction.\"\n\nThe deal also seeks to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea, which was about $10 billion last year. It does this partly by lifting trade barriers in South Korea, but also by imposing new trade barriers here at home.\n\nIn addition to the cap on steel imports from South Korea, the agreement extends for 20 years a tariff on imported pickup trucks. That 25 percent levy, which was set to expire in 2021, effectively has locked South Korean trucks out of the U.S. market.\n\nThe deal aims to make it easier for American automakers to sell cars in South Korea by lifting what the administration calls \"burdensome regulations.\" It also allows each U.S. car company to sell 50,000 cars per year in South Korea without having to undergo additional safety or environmental testing. That's double the current cap of 25,000 cars, although actual sales are well below that.\n\n\"The Korean market is very much dominated by Hyundai and Kia,\" said Alan Baum, a Michigan-based auto market analyst. \"The American companies ... really haven't targeted the Korean market as an opportunity.\"\n\nPolitics As Steel And Aluminum Tariffs Take Effect, WH Considers Trade Sanctions On China As Steel And Aluminum Tariffs Take Effect, WH Considers Trade Sanctions On China Listen \u00b7 3:51 3:51\n\nThe new and extended trade barriers imposed by the administration mark a departure from past trade agreements.\n\n\"The traditional way that U.S. officials have tried to level the playing field is to reduce foreign barriers,\" said Jeff Schott, a senior fellow at the pro-trade Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nTrump's team went the other way: Rather than trying to pry open the Korean market to American rice, for example, they chose to erect a higher, more long-lasting wall of protection around the domestic truck industry.\n\n\"The U.S. market is basically open,\" Schott said. \"Other countries have higher tariffs, and [administration officials] think that's unfair, so they've threatened to find ways of raising barriers to the U.S. market to level the playing field.\"\n\nAdministration officials say they will seek similar quotas limiting metal imports from other countries in exchange for relief from the 25 percent steel tariff or a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports.

A quick history of the decennial survey makes that clear.\n\nThe long answer\n\nThe census has been conducted every decade since 1790 to get a national head count used most critically to decide the distribution of congressional representation. At first it was conducted by U.S. marshals, but later surveys were sent to most American households, with census workers helping those who didn't promptly return their surveys.\n\nThe last time the Census Bureau asked all U.S. households a question about U.S. citizenship was in 1950. That form asked where each person was born and in a follow-up question asked, \"If foreign born \u2014 Is he naturalized?\"\n\nIn 1960, there was no such question about citizenship, only about place of birth.\n\nSanders mentioned the year 1965 on Tuesday, but the census only comes every 10 years, so it isn't clear what she was referring to, and the White House did not respond to a request for clarification.\n\nIn 1970, the Census Bureau began sending around two questionnaires: a short-form questionnaire to gather basic population information and a long form that asked detailed questions about everything from household income to plumbing. The short form went to most households in America. The long form was sent to a much smaller sample of households, 1 in 6. Most people didn't get it.\n\nStarting in 1970, questions about citizenship were included in the long-form questionnaire but not the short form. For instance, in 2000, those who received the long form were asked, \"Is this person a CITIZEN of the United States?\"\n\nThe short form kept it simple: name, relationship, age, sex, Hispanic origin, race, marital status and whether the home is owned or rented.\n\nLater, the census added the American Community Survey, conducted every year and sent to 3.5 million households. It began being fully implemented in 2005. It asks many of the same questions as the census long-form surveys from 1970 to 2000, including the citizenship question.\n\nSanders said that in 2010 the citizenship question was removed. In fact, there was no long form that year \u2014 it had been replaced by the annual American Community Survey. The decennial census form asked just 10 questions.\n\nThe state of California has already sued to block the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census, and New York's state attorney general has announced plans for a multistate lawsuit. The concern expressed by states with large undocumented immigrant populations is that asking about citizenship will scare people off, forms won't get filled out and the count won't be accurate, affecting federal funding and the number of congressional seats. (The Census Bureau is legally required to keep answers confidential, even from the FBI and other government entities. That means it isn't allowed to release data identifying an individual. But federal agencies and researchers can request census information on specific population groups.)\n\nIn a memo explaining his reasoning, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross dismissed concerns about incentive to participate.\n\n\"The Department of Commerce is not able to determine definitively how inclusion of a citizenship question on the decennial census will impact responsiveness. However, even if there is some impact on responses, the value of more complete and accurate data derived from surveying the entire population outweighs such concerns. Completing and returning decennial census questionnaires is required by Federal law, those responses are protected by law, and inclusion of a citizenship question on the 2020 decennial census will provide more complete information for those who respond,\" Ross wrote.\n\nBut if the 2020 census form does ultimately ask about citizenship status, it will be the first time the question will be asked of all U.S. households since 1950.\n\nNPR's Hansi Lo Wang contributed to this report.", "keywords": ["decennial", "check", "fact", "question", "census", "standard", "asked", "short", "citizenship", "long", "2020", "households", "form"], "polarity": 0.11116919803360481, "subjectivity": 0.40223604079536274},

Bush appointee, accused Kobach of engaging in \"gamesmanship\" and skirting her orders.\n\nIn the nearly two years since Robinson ordered him to register those voters, she said, he has forced her and the American Civil Liberties Union to monitor his actions down to the tiniest details in an effort to get him to comply.\n\n\"I've had to police this over and over and over again,\" she said.\n\nIt's an election year, your honor, and there's no more time for games.\n\nThe ACLU, representing Kansans suing Kobach, asked Robinson in September, 2016, to hold Kobach in contempt for failing to comply with her May, 2016, order to fully register would-be voters. Their applications lacked birth certificates or other documents Kobach demanded under a 2011 Kansas law.\n\nA series of back-and-forths between Kobach, the ACLU, and the judge since then have turned on what actions were needed to meet the court's order. They centered on requiring Kobach to ensure the registrants would know they could vote, and that county election officers would know to treat them the same as other voters.\n\nThe ACLU argued Tuesday that Kobach didn't follow through. Robinson will consider whether to hold him in contempt while working on a ruling in this month's trial against Kobach.\n\nThat trial wrapped up Monday. Kobach stands accused of violating federal law by refusing to register more than 30,000 legitimate voters who signed up to vote through driver's license offices.\n\n\"It's an election year, your honor, and there's no more time for games,\" ACLU lawyer Dale Ho told Robinson.\n\nKobach, who hopes to be Kansas' next governor, asked the judge not to find him in contempt. The Republican candidate argued he doesn't control the county officials who carry out logistics such as sending postcards to voters to let them know where their polling stations are.\n\n\"We ask them to do things. We plead with them to do things,\" he said. \"If the counties did fail, it was their mistake.\"\n\nThat's one of the things the ACLU said has been a problem: Not all the voters protected by Robinson's 2016 preliminary injunction have been receiving the postcards.\n\nRobinson, at times sounding livid with the secretary, gave him a dressing-down.\n\n\"These people are not second-class registered voters,\" she told him. \"You assured me that they had or they would get the postcards.\"\n\nShe questioned why Kobach had had no problem getting Kansas' 105 counties to require birth certificates and similar documents from voters in recent years, yet denied he could make them mail postcards or comply with other aspects of her orders.\n\nKobach is a key backer of President Donald Trump's claim that Hillary Clinton won the 2016 popular vote because of millions of illegal ballots. He led Trump's now defunct election integrity commission.\n\nHe urged the Kansas legislature to adopt a law that required would-be voters, starting in 2013, to show passports, military papers, birth certificates, or other documents proving they are citizens. That prompted a lawsuit by the League of Women Voters, saying it decimated voter registration drives, and by Kansans who say they were blocked from voting because they lacked such papers.\n\nThe ACLU is representing them. It says Kobach can't enforce his law on voters who register while getting or renewing their driver's licenses because they are protected by the 1993 Motor Voter Act.\n\nThat law created the streamlined process for registering to vote at driver's license offices, where around 40 percent of Kansans put themselves on the voter rolls.\n\nTo win his case, Kobach had to prove a significant number of non-citizens illegally registered to vote and that making people show proof of citizenship is the only way to stop it.\n\nHe denied allegations of voter suppression, and put experts on the stand to present polls and surveys that they say show almost all Kansans have easy access to documents like birth certificates. He also called witnesses to bolster his case that there are thousands \u2014 or even several tens of thousands \u2014 of\n\nnon-citizens already on Kansas' voter rolls.\n\nThe ACLU said the polls and survey conclusions are statistical extrapolations from questionable sources that make fatal math errors and assumptions that academics widely regard as bogus.\n\nThe scolding that Kobach endured Tuesday was just one of many he and his legal team received during the trial over the past few weeks. Robinson repeatedly chastised them for attempting to submit evidence they hadn't shown the ACLU in advance of trial, and for violating other court procedures.\n\nThis story comes from the Kansas News Service, a collaboration covering health, education and politics across the state.", "keywords": ["robinson", "deliberating", "voting", "kansas", "law", "ends", "vote", "voter", "aclu", "trial", "judge", "kobach", "voters"], "polarity": -0.00847953216374269, "subjectivity": 0.41308479532163744},

Here, in the crowded basement ballroom of a swanky D.C. hotel, the mockery is at least kind of the point: For 133 years, journalists have invited a constellation of Washington's bright stars in media and politics to reach across whatever distances divide them for a good verbal kick in the shin \u2014 and a hearty laugh about it together.\n\nYou can see how this might get weird.\n\n\"I know the Gridiron is really an old tradition in Washington \u2014 been around a long time, and one that's important to many of you in the media,\" Trump told the journalists gathered in the room, whom he termed his \"opposition party\" at one point in his half-hour comedy set. \"So I was very excited to receive this invitation to come here and ruin your evening in person.\"\n\nTrump takes the stage\n\nIt was just the latest Gridiron invitation accepted by a U.S. president, all but one of whom have attended the ritzy, closed-door dinner since the elite media organization's founding in 1885. (We're casting a stern eye in your direction, Grover Cleveland.)\n\nBut it's fair to say this time felt different: Trump famously turned down Washington's high-profile political media schmoozefests during his first year in office, not only rejecting the Gridiron but the White House Correspondents Dinner last year, as well. In fact, to this point, the only media gala Trump has planned to take part in during his young presidency was one of his own creation, The Highly-Anticipated 2017 Fake News Awards, and that turned out to be a Web page.\n\nStill, standing behind the podium and flanked by a minor pantheon of Cabinet members and aides, Trump appeared to relish the opportunity to let loose, training his fire on just about everyone during the roast-style event.\n\nThere was his son-in-law seated to his left, Jared Kushner: \"You know, we were late tonight because Jared could not get through security.\"\n\nHis treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, sitting to his right: \"America has a proud history of treasury secretaries who sponsored the arts. Alexander Hamilton gave us so much. Andrew Mellon famously gave us the National Gallery \u2014 a tremendous gift. Steve has given us the blockbuster movie Lego Batman.\"\n\nThere was Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a favorite object of Trump's biting comments on Twitter, getting one this time in person: \"You know, it's weird, I offered him a ride over \u2014 and he recused himself!\"\n\nThen he turned to his senior adviser Stephen Miller and wife, Melania.\n\n\"I like turnover,\" he said. \"Now the question everybody keeps asking is, who is going to be the next to leave, Steve Miller or Melania?\"\n\n\"That is terrible, honey \u2014 but you love me, right?\" he added, turning to his wife as the joke was greeted with gasps from the audience. And after she mouthed something off-mic, he said to the crowd: \"I won't tell you what she said.\"\n\nThe governing rule behind the evening's roast-style comedy \u2014 as laid out by Gridiron President David Lightman at the start of the night \u2014 was to \"singe, not burn.\" It was guidance Trump observed ... for the most part. To muddy a beloved adage: He reserved the brunt of his heat for some of the absent figures who had stayed out of the kitchen \u2014 such as his former chief strategist Steve Bannon, who Trump called one of CNN's \"true stars, the guy who got you the most scoops and inside info.\"\n\nThat included apparently ad libbed broadsides lobbed at former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (\"man, she's crazy \u2014 but she's a fine woman\"), former Vice President Joe Biden (\"trust me, I would kick his ass\") and Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, which has been investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election: \"What is he, on some committee? That's the only thing he doesn't know, is what committee \u2014 because he's on the phone so much, he doesn't have any time. Hey!\"\n\nAnd then he turned to Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters of California.\n\n\" 'He must be impeached!' That's all she knows how to say,\" Trump told the crowd. \"And I say \u2014 and I get in trouble for this \u2014 'she has to immediately take an IQ test,' and people go crazy.\"\n\n\"There's so much hatred,\" he added a few seconds later. \"We have to stop the hatred.\"\n\nBuilding bridges with North Korea?\n\nAt one point deep in Trump's set, a moment of genuine policy appeared to glimmer through the cloud of quips and digs \u2014 though whether that moment was to be taken seriously or lightly remains unclear.\n\n\"I won't rule out direct talks with [North Korean dictator] Kim Jong Un \u2014 I just won't. As far as the risk of dealing with a madman is concerned, that's his problem, not mine,\" he said. \"He must be a fine man \u2014 do you think he's a fine man?\"\n\nLate last month the South Korean leadership said North Korea was open to dialogue with the U.S., potentially dialing down the tensions that have simmered between the two countries in recent months. Trump himself has traded barbs with Kim throughout much of his presidency.\n\n\"They, by the way, called up a couple of days ago. They said, 'We would like to talk.' And I said, 'So would we, but you have to denuke,' \" Trump said, shifting his tone.\n\n\"Maybe positive things are happening now,\" he added. \"I hope that's true. I say that in all seriousness: I hope that's true.\"\n\nTrump seemed happy with his performance at the dinner, tweeting early Sunday afternoon, \"The Gridiron Dinner last night was great fun. I am accomplishing a lot in Washington and have never had a better time doing something, and especially since this is for the American People!\"\n\nBuilding walls with the warm-up acts\n\nTrump, of course, was but the closer. The sets and sketches before him teemed with other high-profile figures thrust into unfamiliar roles.\n\n\"We practiced very hard for things that don't come naturally to us,\" said Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, referring to his wife, Anna Peckham. \"For me, comedy speech; for Anna, laughing at my jokes.\"\n\nCotton represented the GOP side of the aisle with his set, following the Democratic mayor of New Orleans, Mitch Landrieu. Encouraged by the fact Trump accepted the Gridiron invitation, Landrieu extended one of his own to the president: Come to the Big Easy, which has \"everything Donald Trump likes and talks about.\"\n\nParades, for instance \u2014 and walls.\n\n\"You like walls. We've got one of those. It's called the levee,\" Landrieu said. \"Too much public leaking goes on during Mardi Gras all the time. Gold: we've got that too. There are enough gold doubloons in the city of New Orleans you could literally write your name across a building in huge gold letters. Not that anybody would want to do that.\"\n\nAnd all the while \u2014 before, between and after the two politicians' sets \u2014 the journalists of the Gridiron Club carried out another tradition, dressing up and performing musical skits swiping broadly at politicians and themselves. Lifting the tunes to popular standards and swapping in some barbed lyrics of their own, not unlike the Capitol Steps, reporters and anchors traded in their gravitas for some amateur theatrics.\n\nSpeaking of weirdness, it's not often the common viewer gets a good look at [name redacted, to protect professional dignity] in a silver sequined tuxedo; [yup, these are redacted too] giving Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\" dance an honest, if imperfect try; and [you'd better believe this one's redacted] dancing in a peacock suit to the belted tones of a Carly Simon satire.\n\n\"You're so vain,\" sang the pantsuited ladies in front of the dancing peacock as one woman, dressed as Hillary Clinton, crooned: \"Why can't you let this show be about me? I'm in pain! For 30 years the show's been about me.\"\n\nIn the end, though, this show was about Trump \u2014 or \"King Chaos,\" as Landrieu attempted to christen him. \"I mean, if it fits.\"\n\n\"I like chaos,\" Trump said in his own set. \"It really is good.\"\n\nAnd he closed the night of sparring with one final haymaker.\n\n\"I do want to say this is one of the best times I can ever remember having with the media,\" he said. \"This might be the most fun I've had since watching your faces on election night.\"", "keywords": ["say", "journalists", "gridiron", "turned", "thats", "set", "president", "opposition", "jabs", "trump", "trades", "party", "dinner", "media"], "polarity": 0.15118613319832827, "subjectivity": 0.5187844111624602},

In fact, according to the U.S. Trade Representative in 2016, the U.S. had a $12.5 billion goods and services trade surplus with Canada. Trump sometimes ignores trade in services, which pumps up trade deficit numbers, but that isn't an accurate way to look at the U.S. trade relationship with other countries.\n\nAs she tried to explain why Trump had been right all along, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders cited trade in goods alone, leaving out trade in services. Services make up a significantly larger share of the US economy than goods production. And it isn't clear from Trump's remarks whether that is really what he was talking about.\n\nTrump was in the midst of a 30-minute speech at a fundraiser in St. Louis on Wednesday when, according to the Washington Post write-up, he riffed on a conversation he'd had with Trudeau.\n\n\" 'Trudeau came to see me. He's a good guy, Justin. He said, \"No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please,\" ' Trump said, mimicking Trudeau, according to audio of the private event in Missouri obtained by The Washington Post. 'Nice guy, good-looking guy, comes in \u2014 \"Donald, we have no trade deficit.\" He's very proud because everybody else, you know, we're getting killed. ... \" 'So, he's proud. I said, \"Wrong, Justin, you do.\" I didn't even know. ... I had no idea. I just said, \"You're wrong.\" You know why? Because we're so stupid. ... And I thought they were smart. I said, \"You're wrong, Justin.\" He said, \"Nope, we have no trade deficit.\" I said, \"Well, in that case, I feel differently,\" I said, \"but I don't believe it.\" I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out, I said, \"Check, because I can't believe it.\" ' \"\n\nThis caught-on-tape moment comes less than a week after Trump signed proclamations putting stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Those tariffs won't immediately apply to Canada and Mexico, as those countries are in the midst of renegotiating, along with the U.S., the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Based on other comments, Trump is planning to leverage the threat of tariffs to negotiate better trade terms with U.S. trading partners.\n\nIt's not clear how this admission that the president contradicted another world leader without basis will affect future negotiations or relationships with Trudeau and other leaders. A failure to agree on basic facts would seem to make such negotiations more difficult.\n\nAsked by reporters during a photo opportunity in the Oval Office whether he has always been truthful with Trudeau, Trump ignored the question.\n\nBut he is standing by his assertion that the U.S. has a trade deficit with Canada, tweeting Thursday morning, \"P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn't like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S.(negotiating), but they do...they almost all do...and that's how I know!\"\n\nCanada is America's second-largest goods trading partner, according to U.S. data. Trade with Canada supported some 1.6 million jobs in the U.S., according to 2015 Commerce Department figures.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Canadian government declined to comment on Trump's remarks and directed NPR to a tweet from the Canadian ambassador to the U.S., David MacNaughton, who cited the same American figures.\n\nThis is far from the first time Trump has inaccurately described the trade relationship with America's neighbor to the north.\n\nIn a December New York Times interview, Trump claimed that \"[We lost] $17 billion with Canada \u2014 Canada says we broke even. But they don't include lumber and they don't include oil. Oh, that's not. ... [Inaudible] ... My friend Justin [Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister] he says, 'No, no, we break even.' I said, 'Yeah, but you're not including oil, and you're not including lumber.' When you do, you lose $17 billion, and with the other one, we're losing $71 billion.\"\n\nNPR's Domenico Montanaro fact-checked this at the time. It is entirely unclear where Trump got his numbers. In a recent paper, Canada-based researchers said that if energy exports are excluded, the country runs a $78 billion manufacturing trade deficit with the United States.", "keywords": ["admits", "making", "youre", "canada", "justin", "deficit", "trudeau", "according", "minister", "canadian", "talks", "trade", "prime", "trump", "guy"], "polarity": 0.08187487116058545, "subjectivity": 0.5128123067408781},

That means abortions could be punishable by life in prison or even the death penalty.\n\nNARAL Pro-Choice Ohio criticized the proposal, calling it an obvious attempt to give the U.S. Supreme Court a chance to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision providing the right to have an abortion.\n\n\"Anti-choice extremists from the Ohio Statehouse to the White House are lining up their dominoes to topple Roe v. Wade and punish those who seek or provide abortion care,\" said executive director Kellie Copeland in a press release.\n\nThe measure was sponsored by state Reps. Ron Hood and Nino Vitale, and 18 more House Republicans signed on.\n\nOhio has incrementally added abortion restrictions in recent years, including a ban on abortions after 20 weeks that went into effect in 2017. Not all the laws have endured, though. Last week, a judge put on hold a state law banning abortions based on a diagnosis of Down syndrome.\n\nIn 2016, Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, vetoed the controversial \"heartbeat bill\" that would ban abortions at the point a fetal heartbeat can be detected, sometimes as early as six weeks. Ohio Right to Life did not support that bill, citing concerns over its constitutionality. The bill was reintroduced last year but has yet to go anywhere.\n\nA blanket ban on abortions would almost certainly not hold up in court, even if the Ohio General Assembly were to pass it over Kasich's likely objections.

Bush appointee, accused Kobach of engaging in \"gamesmanship\" and skirting her orders.\n\nIn the nearly two years since Robinson ordered him to register those voters, she said, he has forced her and the American Civil Liberties Union to monitor his actions down to the tiniest details in an effort to get him to comply.\n\n\"I've had to police this over and over and over again,\" she said.\n\nIt's an election year, your honor, and there's no more time for games.\n\nThe ACLU, representing Kansans suing Kobach, asked Robinson in September, 2016, to hold Kobach in contempt for failing to comply with her May, 2016, order to fully register would-be voters. Their applications lacked birth certificates or other documents Kobach demanded under a 2011 Kansas law.\n\nA series of back-and-forths between Kobach, the ACLU, and the judge since then have turned on what actions were needed to meet the court's order. They centered on requiring Kobach to ensure the registrants would know they could vote, and that county election officers would know to treat them the same as other voters.\n\nThe ACLU argued Tuesday that Kobach didn't follow through. Robinson will consider whether to hold him in contempt while working on a ruling in this month's trial against Kobach.\n\nThat trial wrapped up Monday. Kobach stands accused of violating federal law by refusing to register more than 30,000 legitimate voters who signed up to vote through driver's license offices.\n\n\"It's an election year, your honor, and there's no more time for games,\" ACLU lawyer Dale Ho told Robinson.\n\nKobach, who hopes to be Kansas' next governor, asked the judge not to find him in contempt. The Republican candidate argued he doesn't control the county officials who carry out logistics such as sending postcards to voters to let them know where their polling stations are.\n\n\"We ask them to do things. We plead with them to do things,\" he said. \"If the counties did fail, it was their mistake.\"\n\nThat's one of the things the ACLU said has been a problem: Not all the voters protected by Robinson's 2016 preliminary injunction have been receiving the postcards.\n\nRobinson, at times sounding livid with the secretary, gave him a dressing-down.\n\n\"These people are not second-class registered voters,\" she told him. \"You assured me that they had or they would get the postcards.\"\n\nShe questioned why Kobach had had no problem getting Kansas' 105 counties to require birth certificates and similar documents from voters in recent years, yet denied he could make them mail postcards or comply with other aspects of her orders.\n\nKobach is a key backer of President Donald Trump's claim that Hillary Clinton won the 2016 popular vote because of millions of illegal ballots. He led Trump's now defunct election integrity commission.\n\nHe urged the Kansas legislature to adopt a law that required would-be voters, starting in 2013, to show passports, military papers, birth certificates, or other documents proving they are citizens. That prompted a lawsuit by the League of Women Voters, saying it decimated voter registration drives, and by Kansans who say they were blocked from voting because they lacked such papers.\n\nThe ACLU is representing them. It says Kobach can't enforce his law on voters who register while getting or renewing their driver's licenses because they are protected by the 1993 Motor Voter Act.\n\nThat law created the streamlined process for registering to vote at driver's license offices, where around 40 percent of Kansans put themselves on the voter rolls.\n\nTo win his case, Kobach had to prove a significant number of non-citizens illegally registered to vote and that making people show proof of citizenship is the only way to stop it.\n\nHe denied allegations of voter suppression, and put experts on the stand to present polls and surveys that they say show almost all Kansans have easy access to documents like birth certificates. He also called witnesses to bolster his case that there are thousands \u2014 or even several tens of thousands \u2014 of\n\nnon-citizens already on Kansas' voter rolls.\n\nThe ACLU said the polls and survey conclusions are statistical extrapolations from questionable sources that make fatal math errors and assumptions that academics widely regard as bogus.\n\nThe scolding that Kobach endured Tuesday was just one of many he and his legal team received during the trial over the past few weeks. Robinson repeatedly chastised them for attempting to submit evidence they hadn't shown the ACLU in advance of trial, and for violating other court procedures.\n\nThis story comes from the Kansas News Service, a collaboration covering health, education and politics across the state.", "keywords": ["robinson", "deliberating", "voting", "kansas", "law", "ends", "vote", "voter", "aclu", "trial", "judge", "kobach", "voters"], "polarity": -0.00847953216374269, "subjectivity": 0.41308479532163744},

The move avoided a government shutdown.\n\nThe massive spending package easily passed in both the House and the Senate. The Senate vote was 65-32. The House approved it hours earlier 256-167. President Trump is expected to sign the measure.\n\nThe Senate's vote wrapped up what may be the last major legislative achievement ahead of the midterm elections in November. But the 2,232-page spending bill remained mired in controversy after leaders rushed the measure through rounds of speedy votes.\n\nThe massive spending measure includes significant boosts to U.S. military spending supported by the president and congressional Republicans, while Democrats secured boosts to domestic spending that most Republicans oppose.\n\nCongressional leaders celebrated the legislation publicly while they worked behind the scenes to persuade skeptics to back the legislation. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., joined other Republicans in highlighting the military spending increases.\n\n\"With the biggest increase in defense funding in 15 years,\" Ryan said in a statement Wednesday. \"This critical legislation begins to reverse the damage of the last decade and allows us to create a 21st-century fighting force.\"\n\nHe is working to tamp down anger among conservatives over spending increases as well as changes to gun policy. Among their chief concerns, the legislation would usher in a period of trillion-dollar deficits at a time when Republicans have complete control of the federal government.\n\nMembers of the conservative House Freedom Caucus said Wednesday that they plan to oppose the bill over those concerns.\n\n\"That is not in any way close what the election was about, close to what we campaigned on,\" said Ohio Republican Jim Jordan. \"Not close to what we told the American people we were going to accomplish if they gave us the privilege to serve and be in power.\"\n\nDemocrats are facing a separate set of frustrations from the left flank of their party. Many immigration advocates are angry that the legislation includes $1.6 billion in border security money without corresponding protections for immigrants currently protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., focused instead on spending increases for domestic programs.\n\nNPR via YouTube\n\n\"Every bill takes compromise, and there was plenty here, but at the end of the day, we Democrats feel very good because so many of our priorities for the middle class were included,\" Schumer said. \"From opioid funding to rural broadband, and from student loans to child care, this bill puts workers and families first.\"\n\nThe agreement is loaded with dozens of unrelated policies, known as \"riders,\" ranging from gun control to election security aimed at wooing skeptical lawmakers to back the deal.\n\nAdding riders is a common \u2014 if sometimes controversial \u2014 practice used by both parties and the president to jockey for their priorities because they are guaranteed to become law on a must-pass spending bill.\n\nThe fight over border security and immigration became a major drag on negotiations in recent weeks with both sides refusing to negotiate.\n\nThe White House initially wanted $25 billion, but Democrats pushed for a far smaller amount with explicit restrictions on how the money could be spent.\n\nThe final $1.6 billion agreement would fund new fencing along roughly 30 miles of the border that was authorized under an earlier bill. Negotiators also reached a deal to repair existing fencing while explicitly protecting the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge in Texas.\n\nThe bill also includes nearly $700 million for election security, including additional money for the FBI to conduct counter-intelligence to fight Russian cyberattacks. States would benefit from an infusion of money for election technology grants to keep elections systems safe.\n\nNegotiators included several bipartisan items, like $2.8 billion to battle opioid addiction as well as major funding increases for the Department of Veterans Affairs, federal highway projects and high-speed broadband development.\n\nBut what isn't included is nearly as significant as what made it in the bill.\n\nThe spending measure is widely expected to be one of the last must-pass bills to come up for a vote this year, meaning immigration has few opportunities for consideration in the coming months.\n\nLooming midterm election and the reality that the political season will soon overtake any ability to advance any major legislation before Election Day.\n\nDemocrats remain frustrated that the bill does not deal with immigration. Many immigration advocates worry that DACA cannot pass if it is not included in a broader bipartisan bill.\n\nRepublicans also struck down a push to include subsidy payments that would help shore up the individual market places under the Affordable Care Act and partially subsidize premiums for some low-income workers.", "keywords": ["money", "election", "bill", "legislation", "averts", "spending", "trillion", "major", "shutdown", "congress", "funding", "immigration", "passes", "13", "security", "republicans", "house"], "polarity": 0.051336940836940834, "subjectivity": 0.38130699855699846},

But now things are out in the open and I have to speak plainly, at least to my travel agent. \"I want to go to Maiduguri,\" I say, as nonchalantly as possible.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Maiduguri in Nigeria,\" I say, hoping faintly that the poor phone connection is the reason for her question.\n\n\"You're not serious, are you?\"\n\nSabine, the owner of the little agency in Munich, is used to me by now. She's been booking my flights for years. And they have regularly taken me, as a journalist and an expert on Muslim terrorism and victim traumatization, to troubled regions of the world that no one would normally visit if they didn't have to. Sabine has organized my frequent trips to Afghanistan, Iraq or Africa without batting an eyelid. But she's unhappy about today's request.\n\n\"Maiduguri airport's been bombed,\" she informs me. \"As far as I know nobody flies there anymore.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" I didn't know that. \"Is there a northbound bus connection?\"\n\n\"Are you crazy? It's about six hundred miles away from Abuja. And anyway ...\"\n\n\"Yes, you're right,\" I cut in. Sabine doesn't need to say any more. It would be too dangerous to drive through Nigeria by car. The A13, the main connection with the northern cities of the state of Borno, also lies on the road on which the terrorist group Boko Haram is active. It leads straight by the notorious Sambisa Forest. This swampland is where they have been holding the schoolgirls they abducted from Chibok, nearly seventy miles south of Maiduguri, in the spring of 2014, in an act that brought the terrorist militia into the world's eye. Michelle Obama, then the First Lady of the USA, put herself at the head of the \"Bring Back Our Girls\" movement, with which parents are trying to free their children from the clutches of the terrorists. Am I going to have to forget my travel plans?\n\n\"Let me just check,\" Sabine says. I hear her keyboard clicking. \"Hm, you might be in luck: the Nigerian company Medview recently started flying into Maiduguri again, but quite irregularly. The flight might be canceled or postponed at short notice if the security situation gets worse.\"\n\n\"OK, great!\" I hear myself saying. \"Can you book them from here?\"\n\n\"I can try.\" More clicking at the other end. \"It seems to be working,\" Sabine says. \"Do you want me to book it? Or just reserve it for now?\"\n\n\"No,\" I say firmly. I've been dithering for long enough. For over a year I've been considering traveling to northern Nigeria. Since the Islamists of the Boko Haram sect in the north of the country began wreaking their havoc, and particularly since the kidnap of the Chibok schoolgirls, I've thought more and more about interviewing the female victims of the terrorist group. For a foreigner, and a white- skinned woman, such a journey is an incredibly risky undertaking. But recently I've found someone who knows the area to come with me: I can travel with Renate Ellmenreich, a retired Protestant vicar who lived there as a missionary years ago, and who still has good connections.\n\n\"I'm quite sure,\" I say to Sabine. \"Book two tickets for me.\"\n\n\n\nAbout a month before this I met Renate for the first time at Berlin's Central Station. Even though we'd only previously spoken on the phone, I recognized her straightaway. She was wearing a tweed jacket and a huge pair of purple sunglasses. The sixty-five-year-old strode energetically toward me, her freshly blow- dried pageboy cut bouncing in rhythm. \"I'm Renate,\" she said in her sonorous vicar's voice.\n\nWhen we're sitting in a caf\u00e9 a few minutes later she tells me about her time in Nigeria. Around the turn of the millennium she and her husband were sent there by the mission in Basle. Renate was assigned to the station in Gavva, a small town at the foot of the Mandara Mountains, seventy kilometers southwest of Maiduguri. Her husband, Gunnar, took a similar job in Mubi, a little further to the south.\n\nWith a pencil, Renate does me a quick sketch of the area on a paper napkin. \"Gavva's here,\" she explains, and draws a rectangle toward the top left-hand side of the district. \"And this is the Sambisa Forest, about ten miles away as the crow flies.\" I'm startled by the small distance between the two places. Renate's chosen home in Africa is in the middle of the territory where the Islamic sect is terrorizing the population.\n\n\"We would never have expected anything like this,\" admits Renate, who was doing Christian development work. \"Even then there were sporadic tensions between the Christians and the Muslims. But terrorism, and on this scale, was completely unimaginable.\"\n\nAt that moment a group of football fans drifts past us, shouting, waving the red and white flags that identify them as Bayern Munich supporters, and roaring their slogans. We have to interrupt our conversation. But Renate just smiles mildly. \"Football is mostly harmless,\" she says. \"But it's a different story if you give those young men a gun. In Nigeria, sadly, there are far too many men with guns. And it's always the women who pay in the end.\"\n\nRenate lost her husband in Nigeria back then. He died in 2004 of a brief but violent fever, caused by a tropical virus. After that she set up an aid organization for widows. Now that organization looks after women victims of Boko Haram terrorism. \"I urgently need to get back to Maiduguri to find out what the women there need most urgently,\" she tells me, deeply concerned.\n\n\"Then let's go together,\" I suggest. The fact that Renate has a local infrastructure of private contacts also brings the journey into the realms of the feasible as far as I'm concerned. \"We can depend on your people there, can't we?\"\n\n\"A hundred percent,\" she says, without hesitation. \"But let's be clear about one thing: churches and vicars are high on the list of the terrorists' targets. And foreign journalists come next.\"\n\nEven though I knew that, of course, Renate's words from our first conversation go on echoing in my head for a long time. But they won't put me off. Now we both have our tickets and our visas. She's given me precise instructions about what I need to pack: nuts, dried fruit, muesli bars, multivitamin tablets, protein shakes, bedsheets, towels, disinfectant spray, bandages, antibiotics, a mosquito net and \u2014 very important \u2014 instant coffee for our breakfast.\n\nThe food supply situation in the northeast of Nigeria is extremely poor. Since Boko Haram occupied large stretches of the terrain in 2014, the farmers haven't been able to work their fields, and harvests have failed. Food from the rich south comes to the north very rarely. First of all because there are road blocks and many attacks on transports. And also because there are hardly any solvent customers in the corrugated- iron metropolis of Maiduguri. The city is full of refugees who depend on government handouts.\n\nIn November 2015 we meet at Frankfurt airport. I've just come from Berlin, and as always I've allowed a very short transfer time. Breathlessly I dash into the departure lounge and look out for Renate. She hobbles toward me on crutches. She sprained her ankle the previous day. But clearly it didn't occur to her to cancel the trip. \"The swelling's already going down,\" she reassures me, and cheerfully waves her crutches in the air. \"I don't really need these things. But somebody in Nigeria is bound to have a use for them.\"\n\nI grin. Now I'm quite sure that Renate's exactly the right traveling companion for me.\n\nIt takes our Lufthansa plane only six hours to get to Abuja, the seat of government and the second largest city in Nigeria. We get there at four o'clock in the afternoon local time. Hard to believe there is not even a time difference with Germany.\n\nI step onto the escalator behind Renate and her crutches, and crash into a wall of tropical heat and high humidity. In the hall with the luggage carousels helpers run about busily to take our luggage outside on their trolleys in exchange for a few cents. They make an enormous racket. The only problem is: Renate's suitcase hasn't arrived. The big one, stuffed with the things that she needs for the job-finding workshops that she wants to do with the women in Maiduguri. Now we lack both the ingredients for soap production and the molds for muffin baking; these two skills were intended to enable the women to earn some money. Renate is in despair. \"I can't travel on without my suitcase,\" she tells me.\n\nWe hastily fill out a series of very complicated forms to report the loss. A young woman in a pretty straight-hair wig is very helpful to us. \"You might get your suitcase tomorrow, ma'am,\" she says, looking as if she doesn't believe it herself. \"If you like, I can keep your claim slip and pursue the matter for you at the airport. Just write your phone number on it.\"\n\n\"My phone number?\" Renate thinks for a moment. \"Yes, OK.\" She writes down the phone number of her German friend Annegret, who lives on a farm near Abuja. We will spend the first night at her place. The sixty-year-old South German is waiting for us in the arrivals hall.\n\nA little later we are sitting in Annegret's rickety Fiat. It's already getting dark. The road to the farm is quite heavily used. It leads through several small villages whose centers are recognizable by the gatherings of people and the proliferation of stalls. They are selling groceries, warm food and all kinds of paraphernalia. We buy a SIM card for Renate's phone. Then we turn on to a gravel track. From now on there are no villages; the bush used as pasture by the Fulani nomads stretches out on either side of the road.\n\nNigeria's population consists of a great variety of ethnic groups who speak a total of 514 different languages. The Fulani and Hausa in the north, who constitute about a third of the population, are among the biggest and most politically influential. They are Muslim. The south is dominated by the Christian Yoruba and Igbo, who each constitute about 20 percent of the overall population. About 180 million people in all live in Nigeria. Around half of them are Muslims, 45 percent Christian, the rest follow traditional African religions. In many places, however, widespread animist thinking mixes with the ideas of other religions.\n\nWe reach a grove of palm trees \u2014 and the road becomes even bumpier. Annegret skilfully drives around the potholes. When she stops somewhere in the darkness at last, I curiously open the door and step outside. A sweetish fragrance hits me with the warm evening air. It is very quiet. The only sound is the quiet rustle of the palms.\n\n\"Welcome to Hope Eden,\" she says.\n\nAnnegret leads us to one of the round huts that she and her husband, Shekar, rent to guests. It's made of red bricks that they bake themselves on the farm. Mosquito nets are stretched over the windows. There is no running water, but there's a big barrel from which water can be drawn, including the water for the toilet flush. Electricity comes from a solar cell on the roof.\n\nAt dinner in the main house lots of children join us at the table. They're all little relatives of Shekar that the couple have taken in so that they can go to school. Their own parents wouldn't be able to afford it. There is cassava with beans from the farm's fields. \"And you just left the receipt with that woman? Even though you don't even know her?\" she asks. \"How is she even going to get in contact with you? We have no phone reception here on the farm.\"\n\n\"Oh my. And internet?\" Just in case we don't get the suitcase in time I need to rebook our onward flights at midday tomorrow with an email to Sabine. That would definitely be easier than trying to find the relevant office somewhere around here.\n\nAnnegret smiles. \"No, there's no internet. For that you'd need to go into Abuja. It's in the opposite direction from the airport. It's about an hour to the center.\"\n\nRenate shakes her head. \"Let's just try our chances at the airport.\"\n\n\n\nThe next morning we are woken at dawn by all kinds of noises that sound like a jungle: the grove of palm trees coos, buzzes and chirrups. Annegret, who is already feeding her schoolchildren, helps us to our feet with freshly brewed coffee. It tastes delicious. \"Enjoy it,\" Renate advises me, \"we won't be getting anything like that in Maiduguri.\"\n\nWe set off immediately after breakfast. There is no public transport, such as an airport bus. So to avoid being a burden on our host we hire a car and driver from the village. \"If it all goes wrong, just come back to me,\" Annegret says as we wave goodbye.\n\nOn the way, Renate keeps trying to get through to the woman at the airport, on her mobile phone with the new SIM card, but to no avail. \"Maybe she hasn't got up yet,\" I wonder after the fifth attempt, \"or ...\"\n\n\"Or she's conned us,\" Renate says darkly. \"We've been a bit na\u00efve. With that form she could take legal possession of my suitcase whenever she liked. There's not a thing we can do. Why didn't we try her number yesterday?\"\n\nI can't give her an answer to that one. \"Maybe we'll find her at the airport,\" I say, trying to reassure us both.\n\nWe get there a short time later. But there's nothing going on at that time of day. Since no planes leave in the morning, the counters at the international terminal are all bolted shut. And of course there's no one we can ask about the suitcase.\n\nRenate and I are at a loss. She slumps exhausted on a bench and guards our luggage while I try to rebook our tickets in the national terminal. There are crowds of people at the Medview counter. I plunge into the crowd and fight my way to the front. It smells of sweat, perfume and deodorant.\n\n\"The tickets!\" the man from the airline demands when I finally manage to attract his attention amid all the competitive customers. Luckily the official language in Nigeria is English, so at least we're able to communicate with one another.\n\n\"We have e- tickets.\" I hand him my phone, on which the tickets are stored. He frowns. He definitely wants to see a piece of paper. But I haven't got one. Then he passes my phone to one of his colleagues behind the counter. They chat together, looking rather skeptical. \"Where did you book these?\" the first one asks.\n\n\"In Germany.\"\n\n\"Paid for already?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course.\"\n\n\"But the numbers don't agree with our system.\"\n\nOh, great, I think. What's that supposed to mean? Is he trying to tell me that the tickets I bought in Germany are invalid? \"That's impossible,\" I protest helplessly. \"Please look again!\"\n\nMy phone wanders from hand to hand all around the airport, with me running after it. At least a dozen men stare at the document from abroad that's stored on it. It feels like hours until at last they find someone who's able to convert the international booking code into a local one \u2014 and who demands a healthy sum of money in return. I pay up.\n\nBut by now it's almost half past ten. Do we even have time to postpone the flight for another day? Just as I want to ask this awkward question, Renate hobbles up on her crutches.\n\nShe is beaming. \"The lady from the luggage office came,\" she cries, \"and the suitcase is there too!\"\n\n\"So I don't need to rebook?\"\n\n\"No, it's all fine!\"\n\nShe points to a young man who's come behind her to the counter with a trolley: all our luggage is stacked up on it. He zealously heaves our cases on to the scales, and wants to be rewarded accordingly. A hefty charge is also leveled on our excess baggage.\n\nThis is the first personal lesson that I learn about Nigeria, which enjoys the dubious reputation of being the most corrupt country in the world: there are lots of problems and there are lots of people who make money from solving those problems. Everything costs money. That's how the system works.\n\nThen we're on the Medview plane. I haven't a clue why the company should be called \"Mediterranean view.\" From the window I see the skyscrapers and the mosques of Abuja, whose domes gleam in the distance. And the vast outskirts of one- story houses that twist around the metropolis and spill further and further into the bush. The houses become increasingly humble the further they are from the center. The huts of the people who have moved from the country form the outermost ring around the city.\n\nWhen we've left even those behind, the land is more sparsely populated. Near Abuja the soil is still fertile and many of the fields grow maize or cassava. But the further north we fly, the sparser the vegetation. Soon there are only very scattered trees in the steppe- like landscape, through which the Fulani nomads drive their herds of thin cattle. The lack of rain has dried the ground out \u2014 even though the dry season has only just started. Everything seems to have the same earth- colored tone.\n\nAt last it becomes hazy. It looks as if a veil has settled over the earth. At first I think it must be clouds. But strangely they don't part even when the plane begins its descent.\n\n\"That's bad luck, the harmattan has started already,\" Renate says.\n\n\"The what?\"\n\n\"The desert storm.\"", "keywords": ["maiduguri", "sabine", "suitcase", "gift", "nigeria", "tickets", "need", "darkness", "airport", "phone", "renate", "say"], "polarity": 0.054944217045384346, "subjectivity": 0.4422938680428952},

And a whistleblower says he believes the firm, which has ties to the Trump presidential campaign, may have swayed the U.K.'s 2016 Brexit vote.\n\nChristopher Wylie, who worked at Cambridge Analytica and has brought forward accusations about how the company allegedly misused data from as many as 50 million Facebook users, told a committee in the U.K. Parliament that a Canadian firm allegedly linked to Cambridge Analytica developed the software that the Trump campaign used to target voters in the 2016 U.S. presidential race.\n\nWylie said he began to realize the impact of the company's work when Trump won the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and shortly after Trump's inauguration, he reached out to a reporter at The Guardian, initially as an anonymous source.\n\nIt was then that he \"came to appreciate that the projects I was working on may have had a much wider impact than I initially anticipated it would,\" Wylie said, adding, \"Donald Trump makes it click in your head that this has a much wider impact. I don't think that military-style information operations is conducive for any democratic process.\"\n\nWylie also alleges Aggregate IQ broke U.K. laws on spending limits to sway the country's 2016 referendum that set Brexit, the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, into motion.\n\n\"I think it is completely reasonable to say that there could have been a different outcome in the referendum had there not been, in my view, cheating,\" Wylie told lawmakers.\n\nAt the beginning of Wylie's testimony to the House of Commons Digital, Culture and Sport Committee, chairman Damian Collins said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had not accepted an invitation to give evidence, suggesting that the company's chief product officer, Chris Cox, speak in his stead.\n\nAfter hearing hours of Wylie's evidence, Collins was angrier. He called it \"absolutely astonishing\" that Zuckerberg declined, stating that he would \"urge him to think again if he has any care for the people who use his company's services.\"\n\nWylie portrayed Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories, as totally without qualms about breaking laws and undermining democracies around the world.\n\n\"They don't care whether or not what they do is legal as long as it gets the job done,\" he said. \"Broadly, this is a company that goes around the world and undermines civil institutions of countries that are struggling to develop those institutions. ... They are an example of what modern-day colonialism looks like.\"\n\nAggregate IQ has said that it has \"never knowingly been involved in any illegal activity.\"\n\nAggregate IQ, the Canadian firm that allegedly behaved illegally in the U.K. referendum, has publicly denied links between Cambridge Analytica or SCL.\n\n\"Aggregate IQ has never been and is not a part of Cambridge Analytica or SCL,\" the company has stated. \"Aggregate IQ has never entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica.\"\n\nWylie alleged that Aggregate IQ acted as a \"proxy money-laundering vehicle\" for funneling illegal funds into campaigns calling for the U.K. to leave the European Union.\n\nCambridge Analytica, he said, \"absolutely shared data\" it obtained from Facebook users with Aggregate IQ. Aggregate IQ then allegedly used that data to build the Ripon software, the election software platform that was also used in the U.S. presidential election.\n\n\"You can't have targeting software that doesn't access the database,\" Wylie added, saying that he has submitted documentation to the committee proving this.\n\nCambridge Analytica has denied providing Aggregate IQ with the data it gathered, reportedly harvested through a personality quiz developed by the company Global Science Research. \"Cambridge Analytica did not share any GSR data with AIQ, We haven't had any communication with AIQ since December 2015,\" the company said in a tweet.\n\nWylie pointed to a report from Gizmodo published Monday, indicating that internal documents from Cambridge Analytica show that Aggregate IQ developed its election platform and added that Aggregate IQ also \"inherited a lot of the company culture of total disregard for the law.\"\n\nWylie personally supported the \"Leave\" campaign, as he told the committee, but was troubled by what he viewed as threats to the democratic process. He pointed to the fact that a broad array of entities and parties supporting Leave selected Aggregate IQ, a company that he portrayed as having no public presence up to that point.\n\n\"When you look at the accumulation of evidence,\" he said, \"I think it would be completely unreasonable to come to any other conclusion than this must be coordination, this must be a common purpose plan.\"\n\nWylie claimed that individuals from Aggregate IQ bragged to him about their \"totally illegal\" behavior.\n\nHe also told lawmakers that his predecessor at SCL, the parent company, died under mysterious circumstances in Kenya.", "keywords": ["told", "aggregate", "democracy", "analytica", "aims", "trump", "company", "undermine", "uk", "data", "wylie", "dont", "iq", "cambridge", "whistleblower", "care"], "polarity": -0.02888888888888889, "subjectivity": 0.3462962962962964},

Then Wedding Registry.\"\n\nThese are some of the valentine creations of Tanzila Ahmed, a Los-Angeles-based writer, artist, activist and co-host of the podcast #GoodMuslimBadMuslim.\n\nThe messages make people laugh \u2014 and squirm. And that was absolutely her intention, Ahmed says.\n\n\"It is humorous and it is loving, but I think that one of the things that happens ... when it comes to talking about Islamophobia and the politics around being Muslim, people get numb to it,\" she says. \"With humor, you're able to sneak into people's consciousness and get them to think differently.\"\n\nThe project began as a joke in 2011. At first, she made the cards for a few friends. Eventually, as demand grew, she sold them on Etsy. After a few years, she thought the project had played itself out and she stopped making the cards.\n\nThen came the 2016 elections cycle.\n\n\"There was just so much material to work with,\" Ahmed says. \"The Islamophobia that we're experiencing in America has escalated to this level that I just did not ever think that we'd ever be at, and I think, given the time, we need humor and love to push back on it.\"\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn whether the cards make Muslims feel uncomfortable, too\n\nMy cards definitely do make Muslims feel uncomfortable. There's this perception that when Muslims present themselves in mainstream culture that we're supposed to present this \"good Muslim\" narrative, of being perfect and being a good immigrant, and not causing waves ... not being snarky, not pushing back on the status quo, and I think these cards definitely do that.\n\nOn her favorite valentine from this year\n\nI think my favorite from this year is the \"So Fly List.\" ... You have this no-fly list that so many of us are used to being on, and so I like the idea of taking that back and calling it the \"So Fly List\"\n\nOn having fun while doing serious work challenging stereotypes\n\nThere's absolutely a serious message. I've been a political activist for about 18 years now, and it's so hard to get people to pay attention to your message, and you have to be creative and you have to figure out how to use humor. I was also just tired of being serious all the time. I'm a Muslim-American woman, and I can have fun and talk about love and be a little bad. I don't always have to be that \"good Muslim\" narrative that people think that I need to be.\n\nOn the idea of combining activism with Valentine's Day cards\n\nMy whole life is a running gag. It started out as a joke on Twitter [in 2011]. I was doing publicity for an anthology I was in called Love, InshAllah: The Secret Love Lives of American Muslim Women. And all these interviewers were asking me, \"Do Muslim-American women actually experience love?\" And I was like, this is just dumb, this is ridiculous. ... These questions are very Orientalizing and fetishizing. ... So I just started letting off steam on Twitter, with the hashtag #MuslimVDay. And then I had some friends who were like, uh, make me these cards. I was like, this was just a joke. I didn't really want to. The first year I made it for my friends only. And the second year, I made a little bit more.\n\nOn whether a mostly Muslim audience is attracted to the cards\n\nI think so. I think that's who the audience is for a lot of my work. But I do have a lot of folks that are white who will buy them for their Muslim significant other, which is kind of cute.\n\nLinah Mohammad, Justine Kenin and Renita Jablonski produced and edited this story for broadcast.

They were people from middle and upper-middle-class neighborhoods like Parkland, Fla., and Newtown, Conn., who survived shocking spasms of violence that drew the world's attention. And there were kids from very different neighborhoods who spoke of learning to hit the floor before they learned how to read, only to realize, or at least to believe, that few care that they lived that way.\n\nWhat brought them all together, of course, was gun violence and the desire for change. It was called the March for Our Lives. There were actually hundreds of marches, but the Washington, D.C., gathering drew speakers you might recognize - David Hogg, Emma Gonzalez among others. As you probably also know by now, reactions to what they had to say tended to fall into two camps. People who agreed with the teens, applauded them as eloquent, profound, mature beyond their years, and there were people who didn't like what they had to say, some of whom then felt the need to attack them as grandiose, whiny and misinformed.\n\nThe fact that people didn't agree with their specific ideas - raising the age to buy a long gun to 21, universal background checks, barring civilians from having military-grade weapons or magazines of more than 10 rounds - that was not a surprise. Policies that affect millions of people are meant to be debated, but the furious personal attacks on the teens - well, that was a bit of a shock, to me, anyway. Some commentators went so far as to attack the teens for their hairstyles, their perceived sexual orientations, their college acceptances. Let's not even repeat the total lies made up about them on social media.\n\nNow, it seems a bit much to talk about the hairstyle of somebody who had to run out of their school on bloodied floors after 17 people were cut to shreds there, but there you go. I guess conversations about anything difficult in this country have gotten like that. So in the spirit of trying to find something both sides might be able to agree on, how about this - let them vote? Lower the voting age to 16 and let these kids - whiny, mature, brilliant, totally clueless, gun owners, gun haters, whatever they are - be part of the conversation for real? If we're going to treat them like adults, hold them to adult standards, expect them to let total strangers trash them when they think they're wrong, debate them without any regard for their feelings, then how about letting them have some of the responsibilities and rights of adults and participate in shaping the world we live in instead of begging others to do it for them?\n\nNow, I can imagine some of the reactions. Some might say, they aren't going to vote. Eighteen to 24-year-olds barely vote now. So what? In a country where only about half the eligible population votes routinely, it's not as though the current voters have covered themselves with glory. Now, some might say teens are too impulsive, too self-centred. They spend too much time on social media, not enough time reading and digging into complex issues.\n\nReally? If teens are mature enough to buy weapons - especially military-grade weapons - then why aren't they mature enough to decide who sits on the county council or in Congress? If 16 and 17-year-old people can be brought up on criminal charges as adults, as they can be in most states, then why can't 16 and 17-year-old people be eligible to serve on juries and sit in judgment of those crimes? And if you think this is a ploy to pad the liberal vote, let's not forget that most young, white voters went for Trump. It seems highly likely that plenty of 16-year-old conservatives and gun owners would find their way to the polls too.\n\nLet's get real. Decisions about who gets to vote in this country have always been less about fundamental human worth and more about prejudice and power. I was reminded of this when I read Elaine Weiss's fascinating book, \"The Woman's Hour,\" about why it took until 1920 for half the population - i.e., women - to get the right to vote. And that came after a bitter battle with, remarkably, many of the same elements we see today - vicious personal attacks, huge sums of money changing hands, dire consequences predicted.\n\nEighteen-year-olds got the vote in 1971 in large part because of the Vietnam War. The feeling was that if these citizens were old enough to fight and die in Vietnam that they should be part of the conversation about what put them there. Well, teenagers today are dying, and they are fighting. How about letting them fight where it matters - at the ballot box?\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

You can barely buy a two-room apartment for less than 2 million shekels. (That's about $577,000).\n\nWhat's any of this got to do with U.S. politics? At a meeting at the White House with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Trump told reporters that he had rejected a $1 billion plan to build a new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. Instead, he's going to build one for just $250,000.\n\nWhat a deal!\n\nBut that's not quite the whole story.\n\nWhat did Trump say?\n\nHere's what Trump said in full about the cost of the new embassy with Netanyahu by his side:\n\n\"We'll have it built very quickly. A lot of people wouldn't be doing it quickly like that. We're going to have it built very quickly and very inexpensively. They put an order in front of my desk last week for $1 billion. I said, 'a billion? What's that for? We're going to build an embassy.' I said, 'We're not going to spend $1 billion.' We're actually doing it for about $250,000. So check that out.\"\n\nTrump quickly added: \"Now, it's temporary, but it'll be very nice.\"\n\nHe then boasted: \"$250,000 versus a billion dollars.\"\n\nTurning to an already laughing Netanyahu, he asked rhetorically, \"Is that good?\"\n\nYouTube\n\nWhat was Trump talking about?\n\nWe checked it out. Is the United States somehow building \"it,\" as in a permanent embassy, for $250,000?\n\nNo.\n\nTrump was probably conflating two things: a permanent new embassy to be built years from now and a temporary embassy office the U.S. is building inside an existing consular building in Jerusalem to be set up by May, NPR diplomacy correspondent Michele Kelemen and international correspondent Daniel Estrin, based in Jerusalem, report.\n\n\"Internal modifications to allow the embassy to open in an existing facility in May is anticipated to cost $200,000 to $400,000,\" a State Department official tells Kelemen.\n\nAs for financing the permanent embassy, The Associated Press reported in late February:\n\n\"The Trump administration is considering an offer from Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson to pay for at least part of a new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, four U.S. officials told The Associated Press. \"Lawyers at the State Department are looking into the legality of accepting private donations to cover some or all of the embassy costs, the administration officials said. ... \"In one possible scenario, the administration would solicit contributions not only from Adelson but potentially from other donors in the evangelical and American Jewish communities, too. One official said Adelson, a Las Vegas casino magnate and staunch supporter of Israel, had offered to pay the difference between the total cost \u2014 expected to run into the hundreds of millions of dollars \u2014 and what the administration is able to raise.\"\n\nIn January, Trump chafed at the $1 billion cost of the new U.S. Embassy in London. He canceled a trip to London for a ribbon-cutting because he said it was a \"bad deal.\"\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in London remarkably put out a statement defending itself, as NPR's Frank Langfitt reported.", "keywords": ["cost", "check", "jerusalem", "fact", "permanent", "building", "billion", "administration", "going", "trump", "250000", "embassy", "quickly"], "polarity": 0.08942501942501943, "subjectivity": 0.4563519813519814},

That means abortions could be punishable by life in prison or even the death penalty.\n\nNARAL Pro-Choice Ohio criticized the proposal, calling it an obvious attempt to give the U.S. Supreme Court a chance to overturn Roe v.

Bush appointee, accused Kobach of engaging in \"gamesmanship\" and skirting her orders.\n\nIn the nearly two years since Robinson ordered him to register those voters, she said, he has forced her and the American Civil Liberties Union to monitor his actions down to the tiniest details in an effort to get him to comply.\n\n\"I've had to police this over and over and over again,\" she said.\n\nIt's an election year, your honor, and there's no more time for games.\n\nThe ACLU, representing Kansans suing Kobach, asked Robinson in September, 2016, to hold Kobach in contempt for failing to comply with her May, 2016, order to fully register would-be voters. Their applications lacked birth certificates or other documents Kobach demanded under a 2011 Kansas law.\n\nA series of back-and-forths between Kobach, the ACLU, and the judge since then have turned on what actions were needed to meet the court's order. They centered on requiring Kobach to ensure the registrants would know they could vote, and that county election officers would know to treat them the same as other voters.\n\nThe ACLU argued Tuesday that Kobach didn't follow through. Robinson will consider whether to hold him in contempt while working on a ruling in this month's trial against Kobach.\n\nThat trial wrapped up Monday. Kobach stands accused of violating federal law by refusing to register more than 30,000 legitimate voters who signed up to vote through driver's license offices.\n\n\"It's an election year, your honor, and there's no more time for games,\" ACLU lawyer Dale Ho told Robinson.\n\nKobach, who hopes to be Kansas' next governor, asked the judge not to find him in contempt. The Republican candidate argued he doesn't control the county officials who carry out logistics such as sending postcards to voters to let them know where their polling stations are.\n\n\"We ask them to do things. We plead with them to do things,\" he said. \"If the counties did fail, it was their mistake.\"\n\nThat's one of the things the ACLU said has been a problem: Not all the voters protected by Robinson's 2016 preliminary injunction have been receiving the postcards.\n\nRobinson, at times sounding livid with the secretary, gave him a dressing-down.\n\n\"These people are not second-class registered voters,\" she told him. \"You assured me that they had or they would get the postcards.\"\n\nShe questioned why Kobach had had no problem getting Kansas' 105 counties to require birth certificates and similar documents from voters in recent years, yet denied he could make them mail postcards or comply with other aspects of her orders.\n\nKobach is a key backer of President Donald Trump's claim that Hillary Clinton won the 2016 popular vote because of millions of illegal ballots. He led Trump's now defunct election integrity commission.\n\nHe urged the Kansas legislature to adopt a law that required would-be voters, starting in 2013, to show passports, military papers, birth certificates, or other documents proving they are citizens. That prompted a lawsuit by the League of Women Voters, saying it decimated voter registration drives, and by Kansans who say they were blocked from voting because they lacked such papers.\n\nThe ACLU is representing them. It says Kobach can't enforce his law on voters who register while getting or renewing their driver's licenses because they are protected by the 1993 Motor Voter Act.\n\nThat law created the streamlined process for registering to vote at driver's license offices, where around 40 percent of Kansans put themselves on the voter rolls.\n\nTo win his case, Kobach had to prove a significant number of non-citizens illegally registered to vote and that making people show proof of citizenship is the only way to stop it.\n\nHe denied allegations of voter suppression, and put experts on the stand to present polls and surveys that they say show almost all Kansans have easy access to documents like birth certificates. He also called witnesses to bolster his case that there are thousands \u2014 or even several tens of thousands \u2014 of\n\nnon-citizens already on Kansas' voter rolls.\n\nThe ACLU said the polls and survey conclusions are statistical extrapolations from questionable sources that make fatal math errors and assumptions that academics widely regard as bogus.\n\nThe scolding that Kobach endured Tuesday was just one of many he and his legal team received during the trial over the past few weeks. Robinson repeatedly chastised them for attempting to submit evidence they hadn't shown the ACLU in advance of trial, and for violating other court procedures.\n\nThis story comes from the Kansas News Service, a collaboration covering health, education and politics across the state.", "keywords": ["robinson", "deliberating", "voting", "kansas", "law", "ends", "vote", "voter", "aclu", "trial", "judge", "kobach", "voters"], "polarity": -0.00847953216374269, "subjectivity": 0.41308479532163744},

At issue in the case is the Republican gerrymander of the Wisconsin Legislature \u2014 a design that delivered nearly two-thirds of the districts to the GOP even as Republicans lost the statewide vote.\n\nIn the Maryland case argued Wednesday, Michael Kimberly, the attorney for the Republican plaintiffs, contended that the map drawers succeeded in \"rigging\" an election, and the average American voter understands what's going on. He dubbed it an affront to democracy.\n\nThat's the kind of argument that Democrats have made about lots of other states throughout the country, where Democrats are underrepresented in both state legislatures and the U.S. House or Representatives.\n\n\"Max-Democratic\"\n\nThe Supreme Court has ruled that racial gerrymandering is illegal, but has recognized that a degree of partisan gerrymandering will take place and is OK. The question is how much.\n\nSeveral justices echoed concerns about how much partisan gerrymandering is taking place and how much worse it will get because of technology in 2021 when the districts will be redrawn after the 2020 Census.\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer all but threw up his hands out of frustration. \"So what do we do? Just say good-bye? Forget it?\" he asked. \"The people who do the gerrymandering are not stupid,\" Justice Breyer warned. \"Wait until you've seen those computers really working\" after the next census.\n\nMany of the justices' questions hinged on the issue of timing. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wondered if it wasn't \"much too late\" for the Republican challengers, even if they were successful, \"for there to be any change for the 2018 election.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts derided them for waiting too long. \"If you've been willing to accept that harm in three different cycles, I don't know if we should get concerned about irreparable harm for one more,\" he said.\n\nBut as Justice Breyer pointed out, this is a \"problem of serious dimensions that is national.\"\n\n\"However much you think is too much [partisanship], this case is too much,\" said Obama appointee Elena Kagan. She noted that in Maryland, Democrats only needed to move 10,000 people into the district to comply with one person-one vote, but instead they shuffled 360,000 people out and brought 350,000 people in. The result was that the district went from 47% Republican and 36% Democratic to exactly the opposite.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, also an Obama appointee, noted that the Democratic governor at the time of the redistricting said he felt \"duty bound\" to ensure that his party won the district for the rest of the decade, until the next census.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, appointed by George W. Bush, said this district geographically didn't make much sense, that it had \"no internal logic.\" It stretches from the Washington suburbs to the more rural, \"far west panhandle.\" He joked that both areas had farms, but one had \"hobby farms\" while the other had \"real\" ones.\n\nSome of the justices compared partisan gerrymandering with racial gerrymandering. Justice Ginsburg noted, \"There was a period when 'max-black' was the effort. And it seems to me that what we have here is 'max-Democratic.' And if 'max-black' was no good, why should 'max-Democratic' be OK?\"\n\nMaryland Solicitor General Steven M. Sullivan responded that racial gerrymandering draws \"from a history of exclusion of African Americans from our political process, something that Republicans can hardly claim, certainly not today\" when they control both the White House and Congress.\n\nBut Chief Justice Roberts opined that \"one difference is that we've always recognized that a certain degree of partisanship is acceptable,\" while \"we've never accepted that a certain degree of racial discrimination is acceptable.\"\n\nWhy the second case?\n\nJust why the court added the Maryland case to its docket long after the Wisconsin case was argued last fall is unclear. Speculation has centered on two theories \u2014 one legal and one political.\n\nThe political explanation was spurred by a comment from Chief Justice Roberts during the Wisconsin arguments. \"If you're the intelligent man on the street and the court issues a decision\" and the Democrats win, he speculated, \"the intelligent man on the street is going to say, 'It must be because the Supreme Court preferred the Democrats over the Republicans.' ... And that is going to cause very serious harm to the status and integrity of the decisions of this Court in the eyes of the country.\"\n\nNow, as it happens, while the Wisconsin case involves a redistricting that strongly favors the Republicans (although only at the state legislative district level), the Maryland redistricting under scrutiny Wednesday favors the Democrats. The Democratic leadership in the state drew the congressional district lines to make it more difficult for the GOP to prevail in one of the two traditionally Republican congressional districts in the state. The result is that today just one of Maryland's eight members of Congress is a Republican.\n\nThe bottom line is it could be that optics are part of the reason the court added a second partisan gerrymandering case to its docket, so that in one case the Republicans could prevail, and in the other, the Democrats could.\n\nEqual protection or free speech?\n\nThere are other differences between the two cases. The Maryland challengers object to only one district's design, while the Wisconsin challengers object to the whole state's redistricting. That said, drawing new lines for one district, would, of necessity, have ripple effects, changing the lines in others.\n\nAnother difference is the major legal argument. The Wisconsin challengers argue that extreme gerrymandering deprived Democratic Party voters of the equal protection of the law guaranteed by the Constitution, while the Maryland challengers contend that the gerrymander there deprives Republicans of their First Amendment rights by making their speech, their votes, less valuable. But each of these arguments feeds into the other. And statistical analyses suggest that each argument, if adopted, would produce pretty much the same results.\n\nThe First Amendment argument, however, appeals, in particular, to the justice whose vote is likely to decide the case, Justice Anthony Kennedy. In 2004, he provided the fifth vote for the court staying out of partisan gerrymandering cases, but he made it clear that he remained open to finding a way to measure what is unconstitutional gerrymandering based on party and he specifically mentioned the First Amendment notion that government action cannot punish people based on partisan affiliation.\n\nAt Wednesday's argument, he gave only the barest hint that he might side with the court's liberals. Nothing worth putting a bet on.\n\nStill, as election expert Rick Hasen, of the University of California, Irvine, observes, Kennedy, 81, knows he will not be on the court forever.\n\n\"It's put-up-or-shut-up time,\" Hasen said. \"Either he's going to say, 'We've got to start policing this' or he has to recognize that what is going to happen in the next round in 2020 is going to look a lot worse than in this round, that it's going to be no-holds-barred, squeeze out whatever you can, in favor of your party and against the other party.\"\n\nAct III of this drama?

NPR's Michel Martin talks to her about her time at the helm of the organization.\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nAs president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Cecile Richards has been at the center of the fight over abortion rights and women's health care for the last dozen years. She was born into that world. Her father was a civil rights attorney. Her mother was the trailblazer, Ann Richards, who served as governor of Texas in the 1990s. Cecile Richards kept up the tradition devoting her adult life to activism from union organizing to working closely with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi You'll find it all in her new memoir, \"Make Trouble: Standing Up, Speaking Out, And Finding The Courage To Lead.\"\n\nThe book arrives as Cecile Richards has announced she will step down as president of Planned Parenthood after 12 years. In the middle of this big move, Cecile Richards joined us from our bureau in New York to talk about her career. And I started by asking her if she thinks her tenure as president of Planned Parenthood has been a success.\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: During this last year of trying to defund Planned Parenthood, we've been at our highest approval rate ever. In fact, I just saw a poll from Fox News, of all places, saying that they had polled all the political entities in the country and Planned Parenthood was the most popular. So, I think that in an interesting way all of the controversy has actually led people to focus more on what we do and how important this work is. And, of course, abortion rights and the access to safe and legal abortion, the support for that in the country is stronger than ever before.\n\nMARTIN: Why is this the time to step down?\n\nRICHARDS: Well, it's always hard to leave. I'll be honest, I've been doing this for 12 years. But one of my commitments as a organizer is to always bring new people into the field and certainly into Planned Parenthood. And I have met, and we've hired, and have worked with some amazing leaders in the reproductive rights and justice movement, and one of the important things I think about a leader, is knowing when it's time to step aside and give over the reins to someone else. And so I decided to do that.\n\nAnd I think that the organization is as strong as it's ever been, more support than we've ever had. And I'll never leave the field. Even if I'm not the president Planned Parenthood, this is my life - Is social justice and working for the rights of all people and I'll continue to do that in some way just not as the president of Planned Parenthood. And that's, OK.\n\nMARTIN: One of the things you talk about in the book is your work with House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Some Democrats, including the newly elected Conor Lamb, who was recently elected in Pennsylvania special election, are saying it's time for her to step down. I mean, as a person who's worked closely with her and has been another - I mean, you are, like her, another essential woman in public life. Do you think it might be time for her to step aside as well?\n\nRICHARDS: I actually think that one of the interesting things about Nancy Pelosi - and I do talk about it in the book because so much is, I think, not known and she doesn't - she's not out there bragging about it is that, the reason why I think the Republican Party and the leadership goes after her so much is because she is the most powerful elected official in Washington D.C. And I say that having spent a lot of time up there.\n\nYou know, when I went to work for Ms. Pelosi when she just became a leader - or she was actually at that point the whip, she actually whipped the caucus against the Iraq War and got a majority of the Democrats to vote against the Iraq War. She was the lead sponsor of and the reason why we got the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare, and I was right there alongside with her in the final hours, in the final days to make sure that got passed. I just think she is really one of the most underestimated elected leaders in the country. And I don't think it's just by chance that she's a woman.\n\nMARTIN: There's a record number of women running for office this year. And a lot of them are running in very difficult districts. I mean, that are not favorably inclined toward them. And as a person who not only grew up watching a woman run under very difficult circumstances I mean she is the last elected governor - Democratic governor of Texas, lest we forget. So I guess what I'm saying is you saw it up close from little, you know, how hard this life can be, and you've lived it. I mean, up to and including not just, you know, online death threats but real ones.\n\nI'm wondering if you have advice for other women in public life? And I'm focusing on women in particular just because we know that a lot of women feel that they are running then exposes their children to things that they don't necessarily want them exposed to. You know, what I'm saying? It can be very personal in the way that women are attacked in a way that men are not necessarily. I mean, their appearance their clothing...\n\nRICHARDS: Everything.\n\nMARTIN: ...Everything, their hair, their health. So do you think you have some advice for women who are thinking about this and who are going through this, who are experiencing this now, whatever side of the political aisle they're on?\n\nRICHARDS: Right. Well, I think, look, one of the things that we saw - and this was definitely true in mom's race for governor, and I write about this is that no one ever thought Ann Richards could be elected governor. Everything was going against her. You know, she was divorced. She was a recovering alcoholic. She was a Democrat. She was progressive. She was pro-choice. But actually, that campaign was just your classic example of defying all the odds. And it really was this enormous, sort of, outpouring of grassroots, activity, and energy that pushed her over the top. And so I think we're seeing a lot of that today. I'm sorry mom isn't around to experience this. We're now seeing women win races that no one thought they could win.\n\nYou know, I was in Virginia during the race where the first transgender woman ever won a state, you know, state assembly seat. Even in Texas, the first two Latina congresswomen, I believe, will go to Washington this year as a result of this. And the exciting thing to me is that women are not waiting their turn. They're not waiting for permission. They're not waiting to be asked. They're just running. And I as I say, like, start before you're ready. Even if you don't make it the first time, you will eventually.\n\nAnd there's nothing that's going to be better for our democracy than to have a Congress and have legislatures and governors that actually represent the diversity of this country. As I say, I can't wait until Congress - half of Congress can get pregnant so we can quit fighting about birth control and Planned Parenthood. And I think those days are ahead of us.\n\nMARTIN: Before we let you go, you know I have to ask - you running?\n\nRICHARDS: (Laughter) You know what? Never say never. But that's not my plan. I'm really focused right now on, you know, finishing up at Planned Parenthood and then doing everything I can to get every single woman in this country to go to the polls and vote this November. If we do, we're going to change the direction of America.\n\nMARTIN: That's Cecile Richards. She is the outgoing president of Planned Parenthood. We're talking about her new memoir, \"Make Trouble: Standing Up, Speaking Out, And Finding The Courage To Lead.\" She was kind of to join us from our bureau in New York. Cecile Richards, thanks so much for speaking with us.\n\nRICHARDS: Thanks, Michel.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

But this year, the state legislature is going into a special session to continue discussions about whether or not to include it in its budget. By the time the regular session adjourned Saturday, members of Virginia's GOP-controlled House of Delegates and Senate could not reach agreement on whether or not to expand Medicaid.\n\nRepublican Delegate Barry Knight from the Virginia Beach area calls it \"the 800-pound gorilla in the room.\" He's one of more than a dozen Republicans who voted to include Medicaid expansion in the House budget \u2014 along with a work requirement \u2014 this year.\n\nIt's a big shift in the House position on the issue and comes after 15 seats flipped in the so-called \"blue wave\" of last November's election, which also saw the election of Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam.\n\n\"On the big-picture issues, I think it was a re-awakening and a call to look at things from a different perspective,\" says Republican Delegate Chris Peace, from the Richmond area.\n\nAt a recent rally outside the state Capitol in Richmond, Northam continued his campaign message. \"Are you all ready to get this done?\" he called to the crowd's cheers. \"Are you ready to expand coverage?\"\n\nA December poll showed over 80 percent of likely Virginia voters support an expansion.\n\n\"I think the House heard that message, loud and clear. I think the Senate still needs to listen a little bit,\" Northam says.\n\nHe's referring to a strong movement against expansion, led by Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment from the Tidewater area in southeastern Virginia. Norment has come out against the House Republicans who want to expand. He reminds them that despite a slim margin, Republicans are still in charge and could stop Medicaid expansion.\n\n\"I do think that the House of Delegates is waiting for that moment of lucidity and epiphany to realize that their majority is 51 to 49,\" Norment says.\n\nBut President Trump has managed to mobilize Democratic voters, says Bob Holsworth, a former political science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University. He thinks expansion has a greater chance this year.\n\nIt could pass in the Senate, he says, because of a potential wildcard.\n\nThat wildcard is Republican Sen. Emmett Hanger, from mostly-rural central Virginia. Hanger has expressed support for some form of Medicaid expansion, and has a track record of voting independently, says Holsworth.\n\n\"What Hanger has said that's very interesting ... is that if he decides to support some version of Medicaid expansion, he says, 'There are a number of other Republicans who are going to go over with me.' \"\n\nHowever, Hanger isn't happy about a tax on hospitals that has been incorporated into the House's budget to help pay for the state's share of expansion costs. The tax accounts for about three quarters of the over $400 million Medicaid-related gulf between House and Senate budgets.\n\nIf legislators don't come up with a budget that includes Medicaid expansion, Northam has a plan B. He says he'll introduce an amendment to add it back into the budget. In the amendment process, the lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, gets a vote if the Senate ties. Fairfax says he'd be happy to vote to expand coverage to up to 400,000 low-income Virginians.\n\n\"There are so many people that we can help and we have the means to do it if we expand Medicaid. We just have to have the political will to do it,\" Fairfax says.\n\nAmong those expansion would help in Virginia: low-income adults without children.\n\n\"An adult who does not have children can have zero income \u2014 can be totally impoverished \u2014 and they cannot get Medicaid,\" says Jill Hanken with the Virginia Poverty Law Center.\n\nAnd a family of three with a total income of about $10,000 doesn't qualify for Medicaid, she says.\n\n\"It's hard to explain to them that they don't have a choice, they're not eligible for Medicaid,\" she says, and they're not eligible for subsidies for insurance on the exchange, so health insurance is out of reach. \"And the reason is because Virginia hasn't expanded Medicaid,\" she says.\n\nThe special session begins April 11. The state needs a budget agreement by June 30 to prevent a government shutdown.\n\nThis story is part of a reporting partnership with NPR, local NPR stations and Kaiser Health News.", "keywords": ["expansion", "think", "expand", "senate", "budget", "medicaid", "divided", "virginia", "hanger", "republicans", "house"], "polarity": 0.1359292328042328, "subjectivity": 0.4262438949938949},

And that leaves a lasting impression,\" he tells me.\n\nSeverino directs the Office for Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. When I meet with him at his office in the shadow of the Capitol, he talks about his childhood as the son of Colombian immigrants growing up in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I remember a white kid coming up, as I was in the pool, [who] said a racial epithet,\" Severino recalls. \"My response as a kid was \u2014 I was confused, in a way. Why would they say such a thing?\"\n\nLater, when he entered high school, Severino's counselor tried to steer him to shop class and vocational training.\n\n\"And I said, 'Well, don't you offer honors classes?' \" Severino says. \"And the counselor, who was white, said, 'Yeah, but you'll have to take a test.' \"\n\nHe took the test, got into the classes and eventually went to Harvard Law School, where he vowed to fight for civil rights.\n\n\"I've been moved to help others who face much worse discrimination than I ever did get a chance at the American dream,\" he says.\n\nBut since he took over as head of the HHS civil rights office a year ago, some advocates see Severino's tenure at the agency as more of a nightmare.\n\n\"Director Severino presents himself as a civil rights lawyer. And what he has done as OCR director is turn the idea of civil rights on its head,\" says Harper Jean Tobin, policy director at the National Center for Transgender Equality.\n\nThat's because Severino \u2014 a devout Catholic and political conservative \u2014 has put the right to religious freedom front and center in his fight against discrimination in health care.\n\nIn public appearances he refers to religious freedom as \"the first freedom.\" Since coming to HHS he has issued a rule that allows employers to refuse to cover birth control as part of their employee health insurance plans, if employers have a religious or moral objection to contraception.\n\nAnd earlier this year he created an entirely new division within the civil rights office \u2014 the Division of Conscience and Religious Freedom.\n\nIts mission, he says, is to ensure that health care workers and health care companies are never forced to participate in particular medical services \u2014 such as abortion and assisted suicide \u2014 if they object. When he was at the conservative Heritage Foundation, he also argued that health workers be allowed to opt out of participating in medical procedures that could further gender transitions.\n\nHHS's Office for Civil Rights has traditionally focused on making sure people are not denied medical care because of their race or gender. And it is charged with protecting patients' medical privacy. The office tends to get roughly 25,000 complaints each year.\n\nUnder the Obama administration, those civil rights protections were extended to gay, lesbian and transgender people. At the time, Severino was working at the Heritage Foundation and called that interpretation of the law \"radical.\"\n\nHis aim, he says, is to tilt the balance back \u2014 to make sure people with religious objections are not forced in their work to violate their religious beliefs.\n\n\"All we're doing is saying that we will be enforcing all of the civil rights laws,\" he says. \"And all those civil rights laws include conscience and religious freedom. We believe they weren't given the proper attention for too long a time, and now it will be getting the proper attention it deserves.\"\n\nThat's little comfort to Severino's critics, who say his efforts are likely to reduce women's access to reproductive health services and could aggravate discrimination against transgender people.\n\nJust a few weeks after he started at HHS, Severino met with representatives from several different advocacy groups \u2014 including Judith Lichtman, senior adviser to the National Partnership for Women and Families.\n\nShe says Severino billed the meeting with about 20 people as a \"listening session.\"\n\n\"He opened the meeting telling us his heartfelt story about knowing and understanding discrimination,\" she says. \"And, frankly, stories will get you just so far.\"\n\nBecause he was \"listening,\" Lichtman says, Severino declined to answer questions about his own positions on specific issues. But she believes his actions since then \u2014 including creating the religious freedom office \u2014 point to a desire to limit women's access to reproductive health services.\n\n\"Abortion is a legal health care service in this country,\" Lichtman says. \"And if, indeed, what Mr. Severino is intending to do is to undermine protections for women who are seeking a legal health care service, I'd say that's pretty abhorrent.\"\n\nTobin, the transgender-rights advocate, was also at that meeting and has similar concerns.\n\n\"No one is forcing doctors to perform gender-affirming surgeries against their will,\" Tobin says. \"But what is happening every day, is transgender patients are being denied every kind of medical care you can think of.\"\n\nMore than a third of the more than 27,000 transgender adults polled in the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey said they experienced health care discrimination in the previous year. And a report by the Center for American Progress \u2014 which reviewed a subset of complaints to the office of civil rights \u2014 shows that the majority of discrimination complaints filed by transgender people were related to medical care that had nothing to do with gender transition.\n\nBut Severino says it is equally alarming that doctors or nurses would be forced to violate their conscience to keep their jobs. He says since he arrived at HHS and made it clear he was open to listening to complaints of conscience, his office has received more of these complaints than were filed in all the Obama years combined.\n\n\"America's doctors and nurses are dedicated to saving lives,\" he says. \"And they shouldn't be bullied out of the practice of medicine simply because they object to performing abortions against their conscience.\"\n\nJocelyn Samuels, who was the head of the office for civil rights during the Obama years, says she worries that under the current administration, the office will divert too much energy to handling a relatively small number of religious freedom and conscience complaints.\n\nThe number of such complaints \"pale in comparison to the thousands of complaints that OCR receives under the civil rights laws, and under HIPAA \u2014 the law that protects the privacy and security of medical information,\" Samuels says.\n\nSeverino previously worked at the Becket Fund, a nonprofit law firm that focuses on religious freedom. According to the conservative Heritage Foundation, Severino focused while there on \"religious liberty, marriage and life issues,\" as head of the foundation's DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society.\n\nHe also spent seven years in the Justice Department's civil rights division. He points to those years to reassure his critics that he will defend everyone with a valid discrimination complaint.\n\nSeverino is particularly proud of a housing discrimination case he fought in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina: In an effort to prevent blacks from New Orleans from moving into a particular neighborhood, a local community had banned some homeowners from renting their houses.\n\nA courtroom exhibit from the case \u2014 a map of the region with its racial breakdown \u2014 sits in the corner of his otherwise undecorated office.\n\nAnd, to underline Severino's civil rights credentials, his staff sent me a document titled \"Proof of Impact of Roger Severino's Career in Civil Rights.\"\n\nI reached out to several people who have worked with Severino, and none would speak with me about him on the record. Those who spoke on background say he is honest and direct and has a way of connecting with his clients. And, they say, they expect he will apply the law fairly.", "keywords": ["office", "civil", "transgender", "refuse", "chief", "religious", "health", "defends", "rights", "medical", "severino", "hhs", "grounds", "discrimination", "care", "right"], "polarity": 0.06430410204682051, "subjectivity": 0.34783598817579386},

The Federal Election Commission has also opened a preliminary investigation into this question.\n\nThe NRA is not required to be transparent about how money moves among its various political entities, and this leaves questions unanswered about how these foreign funds were ultimately spent.\n\nIn the context of ongoing investigations, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, wrote to the NRA earlier this month asking, \"Can you categorically state that your organizations have never, wittingly or unwittingly, received any contributions from individuals or entities acting as conduits for foreign entities or interests?\"\n\nThe NRA said it does receive foreign money but not for election purposes.\n\n\"While we do receive some contributions from foreign individuals and entities, those contributions are made directly to the NRA for lawful purposes,\" NRA's General Counsel John C. Frazer wrote to Wyden in a letter obtained by NPR. \"Our review of our records has found no foreign donations in connection with a United States election, either directly or through a conduit.\"\n\nIn 2015 to 2016, Frazer continued, the NRA received money from companies based in the U.S. that may be owned or managed by foreign nationals. \"However, none of those entities or individuals is connected with Russia, and none of their contributions were made in connection with U.S. elections,\" Frazer added.\n\nThe NRA's response was not sufficient for Wyden. In a letter dated March 27, the senator demanded that the organization provide a detailed accounting of how foreign funds were used over the past three years, whether they were targeted at particular American audiences and what the measured impact was.\n\nWyden also demanded to know whether any Russian nationals or foreign individuals had been members of the NRA's donor programs and whether the NRA received any money from sanctioned individuals.\n\nWhile the NRA claims it does not receive foreign money for election purposes, the movement of its money among accounts could make it difficult, if not impossible, to track how the money is spent since it is not isolated or sequestered.\n\nThe NRA has a variety of accounts, and the NRA Political Victory Fund is its official political action committee and must report all of its spending to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nIt also has other accounts that require less transparency and do not report spending to the FEC \u2014 and in those funds, the NRA told Wyden, the group receives \"funds from foreign persons only for purposes not connected to elections, as permitted by federal law.\"\n\nHowever, the NRA acknowledges that money moves among those accounts: \"Transfers between accounts are made as permitted by law,\" the NRA's general counsel wrote.\n\nThe NRA did not immediately respond to a request from NPR to disclose the total sum of its donations from foreign sources.\n\nThe NRA has been the subject of criticism for its opposition to gun control measures \u2014 criticism that has intensified in the wake of shootings at a high school in Parkland, Fla., last month.\n\nThe controversy around the NRA and alleged ties to Russia center on one man: Kremlin-linked Russian politician Alexander Torshin. Starting in 2011, Torshin began cultivating ties with the National Rifle Association, establishing relationships with NRA officials, notably former NRA President David Keene.\n\nTorshin's relationship with the NRA opened the door to his becoming an election observer in during the 2012 U.S. presidential election and at least five years of attendance at NRA conventions.

That changed during the 2016 presidential race.\n\n\"I was going out into the field and covering a lot of Trump rallies and talking to people,\" Klepper says, \"and they were getting a lot of their ideas and their news from these far-right sources. So what first felt fringe, suddenly felt mainstream.\"\n\nToday those sites are required reading for Klepper's job. As the host of Comedy Central's satirical political show The Opposition, Klepper delivers commentaries in the persona of a far-right conspiracy theorist.\n\n\"He creates his own reality,\" Klepper says of his character. \"He sees the two dots and he fills the spaces with the things that make him feel more comfortable.\"\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn developing his character for The Opposition\n\nThe character that I play lives in this world of Alex Jones, but is not a one-to-one satirization of Alex Jones. We kind of wanted to create a character that stood alone from those characters. So it's got the paranoia and the opportunism of an Alex Jones; it's got the Trump support of a Sean Hannity. It feels like state-run media. It's got the snark and smarm of a Jesse Watters, and it's got a little bit of Midwestern Jordan Klepper in there as well.\n\nThe look that we've started to cultivate is less like \"I'm a New York guy with skinny ties and thin suits.\" ... These guys like to have flashier suits, bigger watches, big stripes and things of that nature. And so costume-wise we try to go in that direction. They sort of all preach the prosperity gospel; they're going to talk about God. But the best way to show that you are a person of God and living a righteous path is that you are successful. I think the Jordan Klepper character on the show wants to show he's successful in how he looks and how he holds himself.\n\nOn how he relates to the people he satirizes\n\nI don't want to overplay my hand as someone who has lived a really difficult, tough life. I've been very fortunate. I had a great upbringing. [But] trying to become a professional comedian had its toil. I didn't have a lot of successes. I had a lot of failures, and I think out of that comes this [insecurity of], \"Am I smart enough? Am I thoughtful enough?\" And I do think we're all dealing with those issues and we all have those fears deep down inside. ...\n\nWhen I look at these characters who might be more on the fringe, who I disagree with ideologically or the things that they're pushing, and I try to find what is really going on right there \u2014 \"Why are you pushing so hard against this anti-intellectualism? Why are you so angry?\" \u2014 it's like, I think I can relate to [you] because you are scared.\n\nOn how \"resistance\" is a theme for both the left and the right\n\nYou see the ideology that exists on these far fringier sites like Infowars and even Breitbart \u2014 they're not like traditional Republican ideologies. They're based in conflict and opposing the mainstream \u2014 anti-mainstream, anti-intellectualism, anti-fact in many ways.\n\nAs we wanted to build this show, we saw that, \"This is all opposing something. Find an enemy. Call it out. We want to be that.\" We also realized what was so interesting is [Jones] was calling himself \"the resistance\" at the same time Keith Olbermann had a show calling itself The Resistance, and it felt like a very American moment that we could all be united in being against something. We're all resisting something. We all want to be the underdogs.\n\nOn getting cast for The Daily Show over his wife and comedy partner, Laura Grey\n\nThey had us both audition and we went through a bunch of rounds. We both came in and read with Jon [Stewart] and they could only take one person, and I was the person who got that job, which was one of the weirdest, strangest, happiest, saddest moments of my life. ...\n\nWe had worked together for so long, worked on these projects and gotten so close to this really cool dream job \u2014 one which she was so perfect for, I felt I had a strong chance for. ... So I got to go along with it and she didn't and started working on other things. ...\n\nIt's kind of the truth of this industry. On the outside everything is a dream and you get to have dream jobs. And, again, I am so fortunate with the opportunities that I had, but up until that point, Laura and I had both been doing comedy for 15 years and we had some successes, but a lot of that was us making videos ourselves on no money, teaching improv 40 hours a week to try to get by, hustling, getting really close to opportunities and then failing. So this idea of this dream thing happening and everything is great is a fallacy. I think when I had that opportunity ... it was a mix of so many emotions.

Ronny Jackson to be secretary of Veterans Affairs. Veteran and Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.) tells NPR's Michel Martin why he supports the new leadership.\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nWe're going to start the program today with the recent shakeup at the Department of Veterans Affairs. President Trump nominated Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson, the top White House physician, to replace Dr. David Shulkin as secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. It's a huge and complex job overseeing medical facilities around the country, hundreds of thousands of employees, not to mention programs that distribute hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits to veterans and beneficiaries. Jackson will need to be confirmed by the Senate before he officially steps into the job.\n\nNeedless to say, no one veteran can speak for all veterans, but we thought we'd like to hear from one of the military veterans serving in Congress, so we called Republican Congressman Mike Coffman. He represents Colorado's 6th District. He serves on the House Armed Services Committee, and he's with us now from Aurora. Congressman, thanks so much for joining us.\n\nMIKE COFFMAN: Thanks for having me.\n\nMARTIN: You served in both the Army and the Marine Corps. So if I may, thank you for that. So I understand that you have expressed the frustration that the incumbent of that position, whoever it is, needs to clean house. The question is, does Dr. Jackson have the kind of experience leading a large, complex organization to not just clean house but then to fix the house? Do you think he has that experience?\n\nCOFFMAN: Well, no matter how good he is, no matter what experiences he has, if he's not going clean the house, the VA will not change. It did not change under Secretary Shulkin. It did not change under Secretary McDonald. It did not change under Secretary Shinseki before then because none of them took the actions to clean house at the top. And I think that he clearly needs a strong deputy secretary who has a lot of administrative skills in terms of managing an organization that is over half the size of the United States Army.\n\nMARTIN: Some of the veterans organizations, and frankly, some members of Congress, suspect that the real agenda here is to move faster toward privatization. Do you think that that's true?\n\nCOFFMAN: No. I know Secretary Shulkin had raised that issue. But, no, I think it's going to be the preservation of the Choice Act, which essentially states if a veteran lives a certain distance away from a VA facility or if a veteran can't get an appointment wait time within a reasonable period of time that that veteran have access to community providers that augment the capacity of the VA health care system. That program is temporary. Now we want to reauthorize it and make it permanent, make it work. It's not working very well. But that's not privatization. I think that that's just a red herring.\n\nMARTIN: I'm wondering if you have any sense of what the Senate's posture is toward this nomination. Do you have any sense of - what are you hearing?\n\nCOFFMAN: I think he needs - in order to be confirmed, I believe he's going to have to dispel this notion of privatization. He certainly can be supportive of augmenting the Department of Veterans Affairs with community providers under the Choice program. But if he does do what Secretary Shulkin says he will do, which I don't believe he will do, he will not be confirmed.\n\nMARTIN: Before we let you go, Congressman, it's an election year. There's a Democrat running against you, Jason Crow, who is also a veteran. A number of veterans are, you know, running this year. I wonder if you feel that that kind of interest in running for office among veterans might be part of the thing that creates a change here?\n\nCOFFMAN: Well, I think that it's good that we have veterans running and serving in Congress, either it's on the veterans committee or on the Armed Services Committee. I think there are a deficit of veterans serving on those committees that are entrusted to make very key policy decisions. And I think that that's the individual to understand those issues is another veteran.\n\nMARTIN: That's Congressman Mike Coffman, Republican of Colorado, who represents the 6th Congressional District in Colorado. He was kind enough to join us from Aurora. Congressman, thanks so much for speaking with us today.\n\nCOFFMAN: Oh, thanks so much for having me.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

His office has acknowledged receiving a request to look into the FISA matter.\n\nTrump said on Wednesday morning that won't cut it.\n\nSessions responded later in the day on Wednesday defending himself and the Justice Department.\n\n\"We have initiated the appropriate process that will ensure complaints against this department will be fully and fairly acted upon if necessary,\" Sessions said. \"As long as I am the attorney general, I will continue to discharge my duties with integrity and honor, and this department will continue to do its work in a fair and impartial manner according to the law and Constitution.\"\n\nThere's a lot going on between these two leaders. Here's a look at the backstory.\n\nFact check: Does Horowitz have \"prosecutorial power\"? The IG would not bring charges himself if he opened an investigation and discovered wrongdoing. The inspector general refers his findings to the FBI or others within the Justice Department for action \u2014 as with a case from earlier this month, for example, in which the IG's office looked into alleged misconduct by a senior FBI agent. Prosecutors would make decisions on their own about whether to opt to bring criminal charges.\n\nFact check: Is Horowitz \"already late with reports on Comey etc.\"? The IG's office has been looking into the FBI's handling of its investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server. That story and the conduct of officials including former FBI Director James Comey \u2014 whom Trump fired \u2014 have been a main focus for Trump and his allies. Not only do they argue the FBI and Justice abused their surveillance powers but they also argue Clinton should have faced criminal charges.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told Congress that he expected the IG report about that era to be complete soon, although it is not yet public. There have been indications that early drafts have circulated internally with some consequences already: Former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who had been expected to retire this year, may have done so because bureau officials were anxious about how the Horowitz report treated his role in the Clinton email matter or other cases.\n\nFact check: \"Isn't the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers?\" Horowitz was nominated by President Obama and confirmed by the Senate in 2012. Before that, he had been nominated by George W. Bush to serve on the the U.S. Sentencing Commission, a post for which he was also confirmed by the Senate. He worked as a career official in the U.S. Attorney's office in New York. So Horowitz has worked for both Republican and Democratic administrations and was and remains a \"Justice Department lawyer.\"\n\nThe background: What Trump apparently wants is for Sessions to launch a full-scale criminal investigation into the applications the FBI and Justice Department made in 2016 to conduct surveillance on his onetime campaign adviser Carter Page.\n\nAs Sessions responded, he says he is proceeding by the book.\n\nRepublicans have zeroed in on that warrant and argued it was obtained improperly: The FBI and Justice Department excluded the fact that part of the evidence in their application, the infamous Russia dossier, was anti-Trump political agitprop, Republicans say.\n\nIn effect, a \"biased\" FBI hoodwinked a judge on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, as the argument goes, and violated Page's civil rights.\n\nThat argument was the thesis of the secret memo released early in February by the House intelligence committee's Republican majority. On Saturday, Democrats released their response. It argued that the FBI and DOJ had acted appropriately. Not only that, the surveillance on Page yielded what the Democrats' memo called \"valuable\" foreign intelligence \u2014 suggesting he was, in fact, contacting foreign spies or engaged in other clandestine activity.\n\nTrump's tweet on Wednesday underscores the difficulty of sustaining a strong political defense on such wonky, disputed grounds. The basis for Republicans' objection is complex.\n\nWhat's more, the argument that the Justice Department and FBI abused their powers out of anti-Trump animus is undercut by the disclosure in the House intelligence committee memos that both Obama and Trump administration officials signed warrant applications for Page. Even Rosenstein, Trump's own appointee, thought there was sufficient cause to ask for surveillance to continue.\n\nThe president supported releasing House Republicans' memo over the objections of his own administration, fast-tracked it into the open in just one week and made it possible for it to appear unexpurgated. Democrats' countermemo took much longer and appeared full of redactions by the FBI and Justice Department.\n\nTrump's tweet on Wednesday, however, suggests his patience with this thread of his defense might be running out. He has blasted the attorney general before, and other supporters also criticized Sessions' initial unwillingness to appoint a second special counsel to begin investigating the Justice Department's current special counsel, Robert Mueller.\n\nSo Sessions' strategy of simply raising more questions about the proper use of FISA may no longer cut the mustard \u2014 so much so that Trump asked why he should even bother. That's why the attorney general's efforts, for Trump at least, are \"DISGRACEFUL!\"\n\nNPR correspondents Carrie Johnson and Ryan Lucas contributed to this report.", "keywords": ["justice", "patience", "department", "horowitz", "check", "fact", "appears", "fbi", "attorney", "surveillance", "sessions", "trumps", "probe", "abuse", "fisa", "trump", "general", "republicans", "vows"], "polarity": 0.04582397208979487, "subjectivity": 0.4636299705919959},

Bush appointee Julie Robinson, has repeatedly chastised Kobach and his legal team for failing to submit evidence ahead of trial and then trying to incorporate it into witness testimony.\n\nThat's led to heated exchanges, with a frustrated Robinson urging Kobach \u2014 who is serving as his own attorney rather than rely on the state's attorney general \u2014 to review the basics of federal litigation.\n\n\"That's ambushing,\" she said at one point, and called a fellow Kobach lawyer \"out of line.\"\n\nKansans who say they were blocked from voting are suing over a law that requires people to show documents like birth certificates or passports to register to vote. The law took effect in 2013.\n\nLawyers from the ACLU, representing the plaintiffs, say Kobach blocked tens of thousands of legitimate voter applications. The Republican secretary of state \u2014 who hopes to be Kansas' next governor \u2014 says he is preventing non-citizens from illegally casting ballots.\n\nKansas is one of two states that require citizenship documentation for voter registration. Kobach's deposition for the trial revealed he planned at one point to speak with Trump about offering incentives to other states to follow suit.\n\nKCUR has this explainer of the lawsuit and the stakes. If Kobach loses his case, it will stop Kansas from enforcing its law on anyone who registers to vote while getting or renewing a driver's license.\n\nThe ACLU is arguing so-called \"motor voters\" are subject to a 1993 federal law that doesn't allow for Kansas' stricter system.\n\nTo win, Kobach has to convince the court he's shielding Kansas elections from non-citizens gaming the system. He claims upwards of 18,000 non-citizens could be on Kansas' voter rolls.\n\nHe has the names of more than 40 suspected non-citizens who registered to vote and is relying on statistical extrapolations to make his case that they are \"the tip of the iceberg.\"\n\nRick Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California, Irvine, thinks some Republican states could follow Kansas' footsteps if the court finds in Kobach's favor.\n\nHasen calls that \"red state election law,\" and says it's based on the theory that making it harder to register ultimately benefits Republicans at the polls. Democrats, meanwhile, see political benefits in easing access to the vote.\n\n\"States with Republican legislatures and governors have been passing laws that make it harder to register and vote,\" Hasen said. \"States with Democratic governors and legislatures have been passing laws that make it easier.\"\n\nThis story comes from the Kansas News Service, a collaboration covering health, education and politics across the state.", "keywords": ["state", "fraud", "kansas", "investigator", "law", "noncitizens", "voter", "states", "trial", "trump", "federal", "vote", "rules", "kobach"], "polarity": 0.021180555555555564, "subjectivity": 0.36423611111111104},

He reminds them that despite a slim margin, Republicans are still in charge and could stop Medicaid expansion.\n\n\"I do think that the House of Delegates is waiting for that moment of lucidity and epiphany to realize that their majority is 51 to 49,\" Norment says.\n\nBut President Trump has managed to mobilize Democratic voters, says Bob Holsworth, a former political science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University. He thinks expansion has a greater chance this year.\n\nIt could pass in the Senate, he says, because of a potential wildcard.\n\nThat wildcard is Republican Sen. Emmett Hanger, from mostly-rural central Virginia. Hanger has expressed support for some form of Medicaid expansion, and has a track record of voting independently, says Holsworth.\n\n\"What Hanger has said that's very interesting ... is that if he decides to support some version of Medicaid expansion, he says, 'There are a number of other Republicans who are going to go over with me.' \"\n\nHowever, Hanger isn't happy about a tax on hospitals that has been incorporated into the House's budget to help pay for the state's share of expansion costs. The tax accounts for about three quarters of the over $400 million Medicaid-related gulf between House and Senate budgets.\n\nIf legislators don't come up with a budget that includes Medicaid expansion, Northam has a plan B. He says he'll introduce an amendment to add it back into the budget. In the amendment process, the lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, gets a vote if the Senate ties. Fairfax says he'd be happy to vote to expand coverage to up to 400,000 low-income Virginians.\n\n\"There are so many people that we can help and we have the means to do it if we expand Medicaid. We just have to have the political will to do it,\" Fairfax says.\n\nAmong those expansion would help in Virginia: low-income adults without children.\n\n\"An adult who does not have children can have zero income \u2014 can be totally impoverished \u2014 and they cannot get Medicaid,\" says Jill Hanken with the Virginia Poverty Law Center.\n\nAnd a family of three with a total income of about $10,000 doesn't qualify for Medicaid, she says.\n\n\"It's hard to explain to them that they don't have a choice, they're not eligible for Medicaid,\" she says, and they're not eligible for subsidies for insurance on the exchange, so health insurance is out of reach. \"And the reason is because Virginia hasn't expanded Medicaid,\" she says.\n\nThe special session begins April 11. The state needs a budget agreement by June 30 to prevent a government shutdown.\n\nThis story is part of a reporting partnership with NPR, local NPR stations and Kaiser Health News.", "keywords": ["expansion", "think", "expand", "senate", "budget", "medicaid", "divided", "virginia", "hanger", "republicans", "house"], "polarity": 0.1359292328042328, "subjectivity": 0.4262438949938949},

And with a 4-1 vote, the Los Alamitos council approved an ordinance to opt out of it.\n\nThe council's chambers were packed with people supporting both sides, as the Los Angeles Times reports:\n\n\"About 160 people showed up to Monday's regular City Council meeting, a monthly event that rarely draws enough people to fill the 40-seat chamber. Speakers lined up late into the evening to address elected officials, who eventually voted 4 to 1 to approve the ordinance. 'Sometimes things are bigger than we are,' said Mayor Troy D. Edgar. Cheers erupted inside the chamber after the vote, with some shouting 'Patriots!' and 'This is a win for America!' as others waved pro-Trump flags.\"\n\nCouncilman Warren Kusumoto said the vote wasn't about immigration, according to The Orange County Register. \"This council is looking out for the constituents in our city,\" he said.\n\nThe single dissenting vote was cast by Councilman Mark Chirco.\n\n\"I cannot see how passing this ordinance would be good for our city,\" Chirco said, according to the Register.\n\n\"We disagree with Sacramento on a lot of things. Are we not going to follow state law every time we disagree with them?\" he said, as the Times reports. \"I don't think that would be prudent.\"\n\nOther jurisdictions have made attempts to do the same thing as Los Alamitos, the Times notes. The Shasta County Board of Supervisors passed a resolution last month saying the county isn't a sanctuary jurisdiction.\n\nThe 2010 Census found that Los Alamitos was 71 percent white, and 21 percent Hispanic or Latino (of any race). Orange County, in comparison, was 61 percent white, and 34 percent Hispanic or Latino.\n\nThe council also voted to have its city attorney write an amicus brief to the Justice Department's lawsuit against the state.\n\nOpinions varied widely among those at the council meeting.\n\n\"If you could build a big, beautiful wall along the 605 (Freeway,) even though that would inconvenience me tremendously, I would give you a thumbs up,\" Long Beach resident Janet Wess told the council, according to the Register.\n\nPam Rozolis, a resident of the city for 48 years, called the ordinance a \"politically charged move which does not reflect all the Los Alamitos residents,\" the Times reports.\n\n\"Our immigrants should not have to live in fear,\" she said. \"It would be a step back to inhumane laws and practices.\"\n\nFor the measure to become a law, the council members must vote again on the proposal.

On the verge of becoming the Republican nominee for president, Trump sat for a videotaped deposition, a familiar experience for a businessman who had sued or been sued thousands of times.\n\n\"I imagine you've had your deposition taken a number of times?\" asked lawyer Deborah Baum, who led the questioning. \"I have, yes,\" Trump answered.\n\nRecords of President Trump's past depositions show a familiar pattern of boasting, sometimes battling opponents and giving little deference to factual details \u2014 pitfalls that could all come into play in various legal cases before too long.\n\nTrump says he \"would like to\" testify in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. And he may have to sit for depositions in cases involving women he allegedly had sexual contact with more than a decade ago, whether he wants to or not. Former The Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos sued him for defamation after he denied claims that he had sexually harassed and groped her, and adult film star Stormy Daniels alleges a 2006 sexual encounter and is seeking to get out of a nondisclosure agreement.\n\nThe stakes of any potential interview with Mueller's team are clearly quite high, but don't underestimate the risks of civil suit depositions. Former President Bill Clinton was impeached after giving false testimony during a civil deposition about a sexual relationship he had with Monica Lewinsky.\n\nIn the 2016 case, Trump had sued for breach of contract after celebrity chef Geoffrey Zakarian pulled out of plans to open a restaurant in Trump's Washington, D.C., hotel. Zakarian countersued. At the heart of the disagreement was Trump's disparaging description of Mexican immigrants in the 2015 speech launching his presidential campaign.\n\nIn June 2016, then-candidate Trump sat for a deposition in a lawsuit involving his Washington, DC hotel. YouTube\n\nTrump was more subdued than he is in public, but no less braggadocious, to borrow a word from the president.\n\nBaum: Why do you think they wanted to get out of the lease? (Trump's lawyer objects, but he proceeds to answer.) Trump: I don't understand why, why they did this. I'm running for office. I obviously have credibility because I now, as it turns out, became the Republican nominee running against, we have a total of 17 people that were mostly senators and governors, highly respected people. So it's not like, you know, like I've said anything that could be so bad. Because if I said something that was so bad, they wouldn't have had me go through all of these people and win all of these primary races. And I'm pretty even in the polls or close to even in the polls right now.\n\nTrump later mentioned, twice, that he had gotten more votes in the Republican primary than any other presidential candidate in the history of the party.\n\nLawyers who represented Trump in this and other suits either didn't respond or declined to comment for this story. Baum, who represented Zakarian, and two other lawyers who faced off against Trump in high profile cases also declined to be interviewed.\n\nIn deposition transcripts over the years, Trump comes across as uninterested in details, unfamiliar with legal documents and occasionally impatient. One theme that emerges is preparation. Baum, in the 2016 session, asked Trump what he did to prepare.\n\nBaum: What did you do to prepare for the case today, for the deposition? Trump: I would say virtually nothing. I \u2014 I spoke with my counsel for a short period of time. I just arrived here, and we proceeded to the deposition. Baum: Thank you. So you didn't look at any documents or Trump: No, I didn't. Baum: anything.\n\nIn a 2011 deposition for a case related to a failed Florida condo and hotel development, the plaintiff's lawyer Elizabeth Beck starts by asking Trump to look at a document.\n\nBeck: Exhibit 323.9 (Whereupon, a document entitled 10 Re-Notice of Taking Deposition11 was marked Plaintiff's Exhibit 32312 for identification.) Mr. Trump, have you seen this document before? Trump: I don't know. Hold on, let me just see. Not that I know. Beck: Well, this is your deposition notice. Are you here pursuant to this re-notice of deposition? Trump: Yes, I am.\n\n\n\nEarly on Beck asks Trump about how involved he is in decision-making at the Trump organization.\n\n\"If other people in your organization makes that decision, do they do it with your approval and/or sanction?\" she asked. \"Generally, yes,\" Trump said.\n\n\"When would that not be the case?\" Beck asks. \"I don't know of any case where that's not the case,\" Trump responds.\n\nBut, then, throughout the deposition he repeatedly claims a lack of knowledge, saying details were handled by his children and telling Beck she will have to check with his lawyers or accountant to get an answer.\n\nAt one point, Trump gets testy.\n\n\"I think they're stupid questions you're asking me,\" Trump says. \"I think you're asking very stupid questions.\"\n\nWhether these were strategic claims of ignorance or simply a lack of familiarity with the document and details is unclear. But it fits a pattern going back to 2007, when Trump sat for two days in a deposition in a suit over the book Trump Nation, The Art of Being The Donald by Tim O'Brien.\n\n\"Oh no no no, he did not prepare,\" said O'Brien in an interview with NPR. \"It wasn't even just my sense of it. He was comically unprepared.\"\n\nO'Brien was the defendant in that lawsuit and spent countless hours working with his attorneys to prepare for his own deposition in the case, poring over binders of documents and refreshing himself on the contents of the book. Trump, he says, exhibited no such preparation, at one point saying he decided the valuation of his golf courses with \"mental projections.\"\n\nThe video of Trump's deposition in that case was never released, but there is a transcript.\n\nO'Brien says Trump's past experience under oath provides a cautionary tale for the president and his lawyers.\n\n\"You don't even have to lay a trap if you are asking about a factual circumstance with documents to back it up and the individual at hand, in this case, Donald Trump isn't familiar enough with the fact pattern and has a propensity to exaggerate in the best cases and misrepresent or lie in the worst ones,\" O'Brien said.\n\nTake the 2016 deposition, Trump found himself walking back testimony when confronted with documents. When asked about negotiation of the restaurant lease at the heart of the suit, Trump claimed ignorance, saying his adult children handled the details and just told him when the deal was done.\n\nBaum: Did you have any understanding about the key business points in the lease negotiations? Trump: No, I didn't. Baum: Did they tell you how they were going? Was there any issue? Trump: No. Never did. Just, We have a deal. Baum: Just, We have a deal? Trump: We have a deal. Baum: Okay. Trump: They said, We just signed the lease. We have a deal with Zakarian. Baum: So they said, We just signed a lease and we have a deal? Trump: Don did. He told me when they signed the lease. I don't know when that was. But, you know, it was a while ago. But he told me, you know, We have a signed lease for the restaurant.\n\nBut then a few minutes later Baum pulled out a copy of the lease and had Trump look at it.\n\nBaum: The reason I was puzzled by your answer earlier about your son telling you the lease had been signed, my understanding is that you signed this lease. And if you look at \u2014 Trump: Well, that's true. Baum: Okay. Trump: He asked me, yeah. Baum: Okay. Trump: Yeah, I didn't \u2014 I believe I signed the lease. But he came in and said, We're signing the lease. So I'll change that. Baum: He said, We're signing it? Trump: Yes. Because I think I signed it.\n\nPresented with his own signature, Trump had to admit that he had seen and signed the lease.\n\n\"Yeah. That's my signature,\" Trump said upon inspection. \"Yes.\"\n\n\n\nTrump ultimately settled with Zakarian for undisclosed terms. And his suit against O'Brien was thrown out.\n\nAnd as the president prepares to potentially talk to the special counsel or face down Zervos or Daniels, there's one tidbit from the 2016 deposition that could work in his favor: Trump claimed not to have a personal paper trail.", "keywords": ["dont", "signed", "details", "know", "combative", "baum", "deposition", "boastful", "trumps", "lease", "lacking", "deal", "trump", "usually", "case", "oath"], "polarity": 0.09045046223617655, "subjectivity": 0.48201814058956904},

The interview was taped in September during the Invictus Games in Toronto, an event created by Harry for wounded, injured or ill servicemen and veterans.\n\nThe conversation is billed as the first interview with the former president since leaving the White House, and it's not exactly hard-hitting.\n\nBut it does offer a window into Obama's life now: still driven by purpose, but with less adrenalin and more leisurely breakfasts.\n\n\"I didn't used to experience traffic,\" Obama says. \"I used to cause traffic.\"\n\nThe transition of power\n\nLeaving the White House after the inauguration, Obama says, his first thought was gratitude for his wife, Michelle.\n\n\"She is not someone who was naturally inclined to politics, so in some ways, despite the fact that she was as good of a first lady as there's ever been, she did this largely in support of my decision to run,\" Obama says.\n\n\"For us to be able to come out of that intact, that our marriage was strong, that we're still each other's best friends, our daughters turning into amazing young women ... that we had done the work in a way that preserved our integrity and left us whole\" was a satisfying feeling, Obama says.\n\nThe former president doesn't mention Donald Trump by name but does acknowledge some worries as he left office.\n\n\"That [feeling of satisfaction] was mixed with all the work that was still undone, and concerns about how the country moves foward,\" he says. \"But overall, there was a serenity there. More than I expected.\"\n\nAdjusting to a different pace\n\nObama says it was \"strange good fortune\" that he and Michelle were in their 40s before being in the public eye. The result was that when his presidency came to an end, his entire identity wasn't wrapped up in the position.\n\n\"One of the interesting things about leaving the presidency is realizing that my life had been so accelerated,\" he says. \"Everything felt like, and still feels to some degree, like it's moving in slow motion.\"\n\nHe describes the sense that important things need to be done immediately, because \"where I'm from 'right away' means if we don't do something in half an hour somebody dies.\"\n\nGetting used to a slower pace means \"you don't have the same adrenaline rush, but it also means that you can be I think more reflective and deliberate about the kinds of things you want to get done.\"\n\n\"The fact that I can wake up and if I want to spend an extra 45 minutes talking to Michelle and take a long breakfast \u2014 I can do it,\" he says. \"That feels great.\"\n\nHe says he is now \"obsessed with training the next generation of leaders\" and that he is transitioning into being a coach rather than a player.\n\nThe impact of social media\n\nPrince Harry notes that trolling, extremism, fake news and cyberbullying have become major issues and asks Obama whether there are things he wishes he had done on those issues.\n\n\"[The] question I think really has to do with how do we harness this technology in a way that allows a multiplicity of voices, allows a diversity of views, but doesn't lead to a balkanization of our society, but rather continues to promote ways of finding common ground,\" Obama says. \"I'm not sure government can legislate that, but what I do believe is that all of us in leadership have to find ways in which we can re-create common space on the Internet.\"\n\nBack when there were just three TV stations, Obama says, \"everybody had a common set of facts.\"\n\n\"There might be conservatives or liberals, but people generally could agree on a baseline of reality. One of the dangers of the Internet is that people can have entirely different realities. They can just be cocooned in information that reinforces their current biases.\"\n\nHe says one thing he discovered during his campaign in 2007 and 2008 was the importance of bringing online communities offline.\n\n\"Social media is a really powerful tool for people of common interest to convene,\" he says, \"but then it's important for them to get offline, meet in a pub, meet at a place of worship, meet in a neighborhood, and get to know each other.

Workers' comp provides medical and wage replacement benefits for miners suffering from black lung.\n\nDr. Crum is the most visible of the excluded radiologists. His clinic in Coal Run Village, Ky., was the focus of a 2016 study by epidemiologists from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). They verified 60 cases of complicated black lung that had been diagnosed in a period of about 20 months in 2015 and 2016.\n\nNIOSH had previously reported 99 cases nationwide over a five-year period.\n\nAt the same time, NPR and Ohio Valley ReSource reported nearly 1,000 cases across central Appalachia, prompting NIOSH epidemiologists to declare it the worst epidemic of complicated black lung they'd ever seen. Our ongoing survey of black lung clinics and law offices has the current count of advanced black lung diagnoses at more than 2,200 since 2010.\n\n\"Throughout the United States, I know of nowhere where radiologists are taken completely out of the evaluation for potential black lung disease,\" Dr. Crum said. \"That's what we're primarily trained in.\"\n\nPhysicians who read chest X-rays for work-related diseases like black lung are known as \"B readers\" and are certified by NIOSH for both federal and state compensation claims. B readers do not specifically have to be pulmonologists or radiologists, though they can be both.\n\nRadiologists, on the other hand, focus entirely on reading multiple types of X-rays and other diagnostic images.\n\nThe law also bars out-of-state radiologists who are both NIOSH-certified B readers and medically-licensed in Kentucky. That includes Dr. Kathleen DePonte, a radiologist in Norton, Va., who has read more than 100,000 black lung X-rays in the past 30 years.\n\n\"It is curious to me that the legislators feel that the pulmonologist is more qualified to interpret a chest radiograph than a radiologist is,\" Dr. DePonte said.\n\n\"This is primarily what radiologists do. It is radiologists who receive all the special training in reading X-rays and other imaging.\"\n\nDr. Edward Petsonk, a pulmonologist at West Virginia University with decades of experience and research focused on black lung, points to a 1999 report of pass-fail statistics for physicians taking the NIOSH B reader examination. Two-thirds of the radiologists passed, while the success rate for pulmonologists was 54 percent.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Howard Berkes/NPR Howard Berkes/NPR\n\nRelying on the expertise of industry\n\nRadiologists, pulmonologists and other physicians don't necessarily read X-rays the same way. Those who work for coal companies tend to be conservative in assessing black lung because the coal companies or their insurers pay black lung benefits. Those reading X-rays on behalf of coal miners are often accused of being too liberal in their assessments.\n\nJudges often decide which assessments count most.\n\nThis seemed to frustrate Rep. Adam Koenig, a Republican from Erlanger and the primary sponsor of the changes in the law.\n\nDuring the House floor debate on the measure, Koenig said one B reader finds black lung 41 percent of the time while another's rate is 91 percent.\n\n\"Obviously we do not have a standardized process so we are trying to standardize it,\" Koenig said. \"No one here is trying to deny anyone who does that work from getting their black lung claims.\"\n\nThat's precisely what the new law will do, argued Rep. Angie Hatton, a Democrat from Whitesburg.\n\n\"When we're finding increased amounts of this illness it seems to me that this is when they need us the most,\" Hatton said. \"Why are we making it tougher for them to prove their illness?\"\n\nIn an interview with NPR, Koenig said he \"relied on the expertise of those who understand the issue \u2014 the industry, coal companies and attorneys.\"\n\nHe'd heard \"anecdotal stories,\" he said, about lung cancer being misdiagnosed as black lung.\n\nEarly stages of lung cancer and black lung can leave similar masses on lungs, according to West Virginia University's Dr. Petsonk.\n\nBut Dr. Petsonk also noted that coal miners exposed to silica dust \"are at an increased risk of lung cancer. They do get lung cancer.

But the 64-year-old from Letcher County ultimately prevailed and has been diagnosed with advanced disease.\n\nThe federal black lung compensation program continues to rely on all NIOSH-certified B readers, whether they are pulmonologists, radiologists or other physicians. But seeking federal benefits instead of state workers' compensation is not necessarily an easy option.\n\nDueling assessments in the federal system mean that some miners have waited more than a decade for decisions on federal benefits. Some die before receiving them. State benefits have traditionally been quicker and more generous to miners.\n\nThat seems to be changing, said Evan Smith, an attorney at the Appalachian Citizens' Law Center in Whitesburg.\n\nSmith said the new state law \"keeps Kentucky coal miners from using highly qualified and reliable experts to prove their state black lung claims [and] looks like just another step in the race to the bottom to gut worker protections.\"\n\nKoenig insisted that's not the case.\n\n\"All we're doing is making sure that qualified doctors are making these determinations,\" Koenig said. \"And if this process doesn't work, I'll be the first in line to figure out how to do it better.\"", "keywords": ["state", "claims", "lawmakers", "epidemic", "reviews", "black", "coal", "limit", "lung", "despite", "kentucky", "law", "pulmonologists", "xrays", "miners", "radiologists", "federal"], "polarity": 0.01646506861932395, "subjectivity": 0.49718894875809755},

The Florida Senate approved a bill last weekend that would cover lost wages for first responders with PTSD, and the House followed suit on Monday.\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott is now saying he will sign the bill.\n\n\"I intend to sign it as soon it makes it to my desk,\" Scott said, speaking at an event to honor firefighters who died in the line of duty. \"What this will do is ensure firefighters suffering from PTSD can receive workers' comp benefits.\"\n\nAbout a third of states have similar laws.

Legislation was introduced after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando two years ago. That shooting left 49 people dead. At least three first responders to the shooting have publicly disclosed that they have been diagnosed with PTSD.\n\nThe bill languished in Florida's Republican-dominated Legislature last year, and a related measure's prospects had been uncertain this year.

Every day, I walk through a different part of hell and have to figure out how to navigate it.\n\nBut after the Feb. 14 high school shooting in Parkland, in which 17 people died, opposition to the bill faded.\n\nBefore the final floor vote, state Rep. Matt Willhite looked up to the gallery where Linda Benoway was watching. Willhite told her he was sorry.\n\nBenoway's son Stevie LaDue, 55, died by suicide in September. Before his retirement after 30 years as a Tampa firefighter, he tried to get workers' comp because of PTSD. When the state denied his claim, he had to go back to work and pay back the time he missed.\n\n\"Why I say I'm sorry to you is because the system failed you, and prior to today, we failed you,\" Willhite said. \"Your son, this may have saved his life.\"\n\nAfter Willhite spoke, the bill passed unanimously.\n\nThe bill also comes too late for Josh Vandegrift, a firefighter and paramedic in the city of Cocoa.\n\nVandegrift was just starting a 24-hour shift in July 2016 when the call came in: A pedestrian had been hit by a vehicle about 100 yards from his station.\n\nVandegrift and other firefighter paramedics responded by ambulance, and Vandegrift cleared bystanders out of the way.\n\n\"I looked down and I saw my brother's face on the patient,\" he said.\n\nNate Vandegrift, his younger brother, had been hit by a commercial van crossing the street. Josh Vandegrift began to treat his brother before being removed from the scene by police officers. \"I remember just absolutely losing it in the middle of the road.\"\n\nNate Vandegrift died about eight hours after the accident. Since then, Josh Vandegrift has had nightmares and flashbacks. He avoids the intersection if possible.\n\nDoctors diagnosed Vandegrift with PTSD. He took his sick time and vacation time, and when that ran out, co-workers donated their sick time to him. When that ran out in August 2016, he applied for workers' compensation. His claim was denied.\n\n\"I had to go back to work or resign, basically,\" said Vandegrift, who returned to work. \"I have good days, and I have really bad days, and everything in between. Every day, I walk through a different part of hell and have to figure out how to navigate it.\"\n\nVandegrift, one of dozens of first responders who have answered WMFE and ProPublica's request to hear from first responders suffering from PTSD, won't benefit from the new law. The legislation will cover people who make a workers' comp claim after Oct. 1, 2018, as long as the triggering event was within the prior year.\n\nThat means Parkland first responders could be covered, but not Vandegrift and responders to the Pulse nightclub shooting. Vandegrift said he knew before he started advocating for the law that it likely wouldn't apply to him.\n\n\"If anything happens in the future, something is in place now so nobody will have to go through what I went through,\" Vandegrift said. \"You know, to be able to get out of bed in the morning.\"\n\nWMFE and ProPublica are investigating PTSD and suicides in first responders as part of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network.

The law took effect in 2013.\n\nLawyers from the ACLU, representing the plaintiffs, say Kobach blocked tens of thousands of legitimate voter applications. The Republican secretary of state \u2014 who hopes to be Kansas' next governor \u2014 says he is preventing non-citizens from illegally casting ballots.\n\nKansas is one of two states that require citizenship documentation for voter registration. Kobach's deposition for the trial revealed he planned at one point to speak with Trump about offering incentives to other states to follow suit.\n\nKCUR has this explainer of the lawsuit and the stakes. If Kobach loses his case, it will stop Kansas from enforcing its law on anyone who registers to vote while getting or renewing a driver's license.\n\nThe ACLU is arguing so-called \"motor voters\" are subject to a 1993 federal law that doesn't allow for Kansas' stricter system.\n\nTo win, Kobach has to convince the court he's shielding Kansas elections from non-citizens gaming the system.

Early Science Says Yes\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Maren Caruso/Getty Images Maren Caruso/Getty Images\n\nThe inspiration arrived in a haze at a Paul McCartney concert a few years ago in San Francisco.\n\n\"People in front of me started lighting up and then other people started lighting up,\" says Matthew Springer, a biologist and professor in the division of cardiology at the University of California, San Francisco. \"And for a few naive split seconds I was thinking to myself, 'Hey, they can't smoke in AT&T Park! I'm sure that's not allowed.' And then I realized that it was all marijuana.\"\n\nRecreational pot was not legal yet in the state, but that stopped no one. \"Paul McCartney actually stopped between numbers and sniffed the air and said, 'There's something in the air \u2014 must be San Francisco!' \" Springer recalls.\n\nAs the visible cloud of pot smoke took shape, so did Springer's idea to study the effects of secondhand marijuana smoke.\n\nHe started thinking: San Franciscans would never tolerate those levels of cigarette smoke in a public place anymore. So why were they OK with smoke from burning pot? Did people just assume that cannabis smoke isn't harmful the way tobacco smoke is?\n\nSpringer was already researching the health effects of secondhand tobacco smoke on rats at his lab at UCSF. He decided to run the same tests using joints.\n\n\"By the time I left the concert, I was resolved to at least try to make this happen,\" he says.\n\nHe knew it would be difficult. Marijuana is still an illegal drug under federal law, and Springer's research uses federal funds; so he has to purchase specially approved government cannabis for study. He also can't test it on humans; hence, the rats.\n\nIn the lab, Springer puts a cigarette or a joint in a plexiglass box, lights it and lets the chamber fill with smoke. Then he vents out most of the smoke to the point that it is hardly visible, to simulate being around a smoker. Then an anesthetized rat is exposed to the smoke for one minute.\n\nSo far, Springer and his colleagues have published research demonstrating that just this one minute of exposure to secondhand smoke makes it harder for the rats' arteries to expand and allow a healthy flow of blood.\"\n\nWith tobacco products, this effect lasts about 30 minutes, and then the arteries recover their normal function. But if it happens over and over \u2014 as when a person is smoking cigarette after cigarette, for example \u2014 the arterial walls can become permanently damaged, and that damage can cause blood clots, heart attack or stroke.\n\nSpringer demonstrated that, at least in rats, the same physiological effect occurs after inhaling secondhand smoke from marijuana. And, the arteries take 90 minutes to recover compared to the 30 minutes with cigarette smoke.\n\nSpringer's discovery about the effect on blood vessels describes just one harmful impact for nonsmokers who are exposed to marijuana. Statewide sampling surveys of cannabis products sold in marijuana dispensaries have shown that cannabis products may contain dangerous bacteria or mold, or residues from pesticides and solvents.\n\nCalifornia law requires testing for these contaminants, and those regulations are being initiated in three phases over the course of 2018. Because much of the marijuana being sold now was harvested in 2017, consumers will have to wait until early 2019 before they can purchase products that have been fully tested according to state standards.\n\n\"People think cannabis is fine because it's 'natural,' \" Springer says. \"I hear this a lot. I don't know what it means.\" He concedes that tightly regulated marijuana, which has been fully tested, doesn't have as many chemical additives as cigarettes.\n\nBut even if the cannabis tests clean, Springer says, smoke itself is bad for the lungs, heart and blood vessels. Other researchers are exploring the possible relationship between marijuana smoke and long-term cancer risk.\n\nCertainly, living with a smoker is worse for your health than just going to a smoky concert hall. But, Springer says, the less you inhale any kind of smoke, the better.\n\n\"People should think of this not as an anti-THC conclusion,\" he says, referencing the active ingredient in marijuana, \"but an anti-smoke conclusion.\"\n\nSo is the solution simply to avoid smoke from combustion? In other words, is it safer to eat cannabis-infused products, or use \"smokeless\" e-cigarettes or vaping devices?\n\nSpringer still urges caution on that score because vaping, for example, can have its own health effects. Vaping devices don't produce smoke from combustion, but they do release a cloud of aerosolized chemicals. Springer is studying the health effects of those chemicals, too.\n\nAll this research takes time. Meanwhile, Springer worries that people might come to the wrong conclusion \u2014 that the absence of research means the secondhand smoke is OK.\n\n\"We in the public health community have been telling them for decades to avoid inhaling secondhand smoke from tobacco,\" Springer says. \"We have not been telling them to avoid inhaling secondhand smoke from marijuana, and that's not because it's not bad for you \u2014 it's because we just haven't known. The experiments haven't been done.\"\n\nAntismoking campaigners say we can't afford to wait until the research is complete. Recreational pot is already a reality.\n\nCynthia Hallett is the president of Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights, based in Berkeley, Calif. The organization was established in 1976, before there was a lot known about the health effects of secondhand smoke from tobacco.\n\nNow that cannabis is becoming more common across the country \u2014 more than 20 cities or states have legalized it in some form \u2014 her organization is taking on the issue of secondhand marijuana smoke, too.\n\nHallett says some of the arguments being made in support of cannabis remind her of the arguments made on behalf of tobacco decades ago.\n\n\"I'm seeing a parallel between this argument that, 'Gee, we just don't have a lot of science and so, therefore, let's wait and see,' \" Hallett says. \"The tobacco companies used to say the same thing about tobacco cigarettes.\"\n\nIn California, smoking cannabis is prohibited anywhere tobacco smoking is prohibited \u2014 including schools, airplanes and most workplaces. Hallett is worried that the legalization of pot could be used to erode those rules.\n\nIt starts with the premise of decriminalization, she says, and then, over time, there's \"a chipping away at strong policies.\"\n\nSome cannabis advocates want to see pot regulated like alcohol \u2014 cities would issue permits for specialized smoking lounges, similar to wine bars.\n\nBut Hallett points out that smoke drifts, and it affects workers in a way that alcohol doesn't.\n\n\"The difference is, if I were to spill my beer on you in a bar, it wouldn't affect your long-term health,\" she says. \"If I choose to smoke, it can affect the health of the person near me.\"\n\nPot is more like tobacco in that respect, and Hallett believes it should be regulated that way.\n\nShe says this era of California culture brings to mind a similar period in the 1970s and '80s, when Americans started demanding more regulations for secondhand smoke, and a new etiquette around smoking took form.\n\nWhen it comes to marijuana, Hallett says, \"it is still polite for you to say: 'Would you mind not smoking around me?' \"\n\nAt Magnolia, a cannabis dispensary in Oakland, Calif., pot smokers talk about what responsibilities \u2014 if any \u2014 they should have when it comes to nearby nonsmokers.\n\n\"This is the first time that I have heard secondhand smoke in reference to cannabis,\" admits Lee Crow, a patient-services clerk at Magnolia. \"I've tried to be courteous \u2014 just common courtesy, like with anything.\"\n\nThe dispensary's director of clinical services, Barbara Blaser, admits she thinks a lot about secondhand smoke from cigarettes, but not pot.\n\n\"Both of my parents died of lung cancer!\" she says. \"I will stop a stranger and say, 'You shouldn't be smoking. My dad died of that!' \"\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 64, approved by state voters in 2016, requires that some of the state tax revenue from the sale of marijuana to be distributed to cannabis researchers. In addition, the state's Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board is examining workplace hazards that are specific to the cannabis industry.\n\nThis story is part of NPR's reporting partnership, local member stations and Kaiser Health News.", "keywords": ["marijuana", "secondhand", "hallett", "smoke", "science", "early", "smoking", "tobacco", "cannabis", "springer", "yes", "pot", "risks", "health"], "polarity": 0.04677403389293632, "subjectivity": 0.43287579629043044},

The proposed budget would cut the office's $15.4 million in funding and the 54 positions that are currently authorized.\n\nThis move would essentially gut a key agency that helps broker compromise in these hyperpartisan times, says Grande Lum, the former director of the CRS. He tells Here & Now's Robin Young he is concerned that moving the agency closer to prosecutors will deter people from requesting help for fear of a lawsuit.\n\n\"What's important is that for parties to be willing to come to the table, they need to be comfortable that whatever is said is held confidential, and that they are not at any potential danger of being prosecuted here,\" says Lum, who is now director of the Divided Community Project at Ohio State University. \"So moving it, the function, to the Civil Rights Division would effectively end its function.\"\n\nIn its more than 50-year history, the CRS has helped protect the First Amendment and keep people safe during the Selma-to-Montgomery marches, eased tensions during desegregation in Boston, and aided in resolving the Native American standoff at Wounded Knee, S.D., in 1973.\n\nJustice Department official Lee Loftus told reporters in February the CRS is a \"small entity in Justice today.\"\n\n\"We are very aware that there are some potential issues if you combine them, because there needs to be some segregation between CRS and its responsibilities under the Civil Rights Act and the functions that [the Civil Rights Division] may have in its regular investigative and prosecution responsibilities,\" Loftus said.\n\nThe CRS has long faced backlash from those on the right. The Heritage Foundation has described the agency as \"highly politicized\" and said it has \"actually escalated local tensions in such places as Ferguson, Missouri, and Florida following the arrest of George Zimmerman.\"\n\nBut those who have sought the CRS's help tell a different story. After the killing of Travyon Martin in 2012, Mayor Jeff Triplett invited CRS mediators to Sanford, Fla., to hold meetings between local officials and the thousands of protesters who descended on the city.\n\n\"I'd hate to say that we couldn't have done it without [CRS], but I'd much rather learn from someone else's experience rather than my own misfortune,\" he said.\n\nTriplett told MSNBC in 2013 that the city was overwhelmed by the massive influx of protesters, and the CRS helped local officials properly prepare for demonstrations during the weeks-long trial that followed.\n\n\"There were dozens of protests, but there was not a single arrest, not a single glass bottle thrown,\" Lum says. \"We were able to have ... free speech, and we were able to maintain public safety.\"\n\nIn a time of deep political divisions, the changes being proposed could slash the prospect of healing communities and reaching compromise, Lum says.\n\nPart of the problem is that political identities are growing more and more personal. The Pew Research Center measured a growing disdain for the opposing party from 1994 to 2014 with 43 percent of Republicans and 38 percent of Democrats viewing the opposite party very unfavorably.\n\nAfter the violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., last summer, an independent review concluded the Charlottesville Police Department should have responded to community criticism before the demonstration took place. In the aftermath of that attack, Charlottesville officials did request help from the CRS in recovery efforts.\n\n\"Community engagement is paramount for proactive, effective policing,\" the report noted. \"CPD must commit on an ongoing basis to being a citizen-centric partner in promoting community well-being rather than a reactive, independent force.\"\n\nLum acknowledges the difficulty of engaging critics when they are radical groups like neo-Nazis or gun rights enthusiasts, but he says conflict resolution techniques employed by CRS can help \"tell the third story.\"\n\n\"It's the ability to focus first on what matters \u2014 'OK, I wanna hear your story, I have my story,\" Lum says. \"But what's a story that we can both agree to?' In gun control, we wanna prevent tragedies.

Six other shots hit him from behind and one in the thigh. The Sacramento Police Department has said Clark was shot at 20 times.\n\nSacramento Police initially said \"officers believed the suspect [Clark] was pointing a firearm at them.\"\n\n\"Prior to the shooting, the involved officers saw the suspect facing them, advance forward with his arms extended, and holding an object in his hands,\" Sacramento Police said in a release a few days after the shooting. \"At the time of the shooting, the officers believed the suspect was pointing a firearm at them. After an exhaustive search, scene investigators did not locate any firearms.

Kennedy's Speech After Martin Luther King's Assassination\n\nWhen Robert F. Kennedy learned of Martin Luther King's assassination in April of 1968, he gave an impromptu speech in Indiana. Decades later, it's credited with calming the devastated crowd.\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\n\nAlmost 50 years ago, April 4, 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. And his loss set off riots in dozens of U.S. cities, but not in Indianapolis. As Jill Sheridan of member station WFYI reports, that's in part because of a short impromptu speech made by a stumping presidential candidate who would himself be assassinated two months later.\n\nJILL SHERIDAN, BYLINE: In the spring of 1968, Robert F. Kennedy was late in entering the primary race for the Democratic presidential nomination. His campaign was gearing up in Indiana. On April 4, 16-year-old Teresa Lubbers tagged along with her older brother to a campaign rally. It was a cold, wet early spring evening. Lubbers says there were hundreds in the predominantly African-American crowd.\n\nTERESA LUBBERS: We were in the back, sort of - so I had a view of sort of the whole crowd.\n\nSHERIDAN: She was not alone in experiencing this shock from the news Kennedy delivered.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nROBERT F. KENNEDY: I have some very sad news for all of you, and that is that Martin Luther King was shot and was killed tonight.\n\n(SCREAMING)\n\nSHERIDAN: Abie Robinson was in the crowd that night, too. He was 24.\n\nABIE ROBINSON: The shift in my emotions swung from very angry when I heard the news about Martin Luther King's assassination to coming to the understanding of what Martin Luther King stood for.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nKENNEDY: Martin Luther King dedicated his life to love and to justice.\n\nSHERIDAN: City and state leaders had urged Kennedy to cancel his appearance, but he refused to. The words he delivered from the back of a flatbed truck didn't come from a speechwriter.\n\nROBINSON: He had it written on a little piece of paper that I'd seen him have folded up in his hand. He was able to connect and so that not only you heard the words that he said, you believe that he felt the words that he said.\n\nSHERIDAN: Reggie Jones was 27 and had brought a group of young men to hear Kennedy. He remembers fearing their reaction to the news.\n\nREGGIE JONES: So I took the guys back to School 63 on the South Side, and we played basketball from the time we got there, maybe about 10 - 10:30, to about 2 in the morning.\n\nSHERIDAN: Abie Robinson says there were others like Jones who worked to keep the peace that night.\n\nROBINSON: There were leaders from different parts of the city that were in touch with the people who would have been in that element that would be burning down your own neighborhood.\n\nSHERIDAN: There was unrest in more than 60 U.S. cities - what's now known as the Holy Week Uprising. But Indianapolis was relatively calm.\n\nRAY BOOMHOWER: I think words matter, and Kennedy's words mattered quite a bit that evening.\n\nSHERIDAN: Historian Ray Boomhower wrote a book about Kennedy's primary campaign.\n\nBOOMHOWER: He was wearing an overcoat that had belonged to his brother. And this was really the first time he had made any kind of public statement about his brother's death. You know, he said, you know...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nKENNEDY: I had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a white man.\n\nSHERIDAN: Boomhower says Kennedy appeared to draw from his own grief as he quoted a Greek poet.\n\nBOOMHOWER: And the words that he spoke, I think, had a particular impact to the crowd when he said, even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nKENNEDY: Falls drop by drop upon the heart until in our own despair, against our will comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.\n\nSHERIDAN: Those words were spoken right here in this Indianapolis park now named for King. A large memorial sculpture has two statues - Kennedy on one side of a path and King on the other, hands stretched out towards each other. Reggie Jones finds that comforting.\n\nJONES: Still reaching out - that's the hope. In spite of everything that you see, there's still hope.\n\nSHERIDAN: For NPR News, I'm Jill Sheridan.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

One basic notion that is false is the idea the Obama administration took no action \u2014 it did. The question that has been asked many times since the presidential election is why it didn't do more.\n\nPrivate warnings\n\nAmong other things, top U.S. intelligence officials \u2014 including then-CIA Director John Brennan \u2014 privately warned their Russian counterparts not to persist with their active measures. Obama himself told Russian President Vladimir Putin not to interfere in the election. These warnings did not work.\n\nPublicity\n\nObama administration officials also told reporters on background that Russian intelligence operatives were behind the cyberattacks that led to the release of emails stolen from political figures and institutions. Later, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson formally blamed the Russian government in an official statement.\n\nAlthough it wasn't universally accepted, the active measures campaign became a part of the political campaign itself. Trump and opponent Hillary Clinton traded barbs about the Russian interference during their debates.\n\nYouTube\n\nTrump has gone back and forth about what he accepts and what he doesn't about the nature of the attack. Sometimes he acknowledges it; other times he has cited the denials he has gotten from Putin, saying, \"I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it.\"\n\nThe president's position since Friday's indictments has been that the interference campaign did take place \u2014 but that he and his campaign had nothing to do with it. On that point, Trump has been consistent: There was, he says, \"no collusion.\"\n\nMueller is focused on whether that is so and whether Trump may have broken the law if he tried to frustrate the investigation. More on this below.\n\nDiplomatic response\n\nAfter Election Day, Obama ordered the U.S. intelligence community to issue a public report about the Russian scheme. Once it had \u2014 and concluded Russia's attack was aimed at helping Trump and hurting Clinton \u2014 the United States imposed a slate of punitive measures against Moscow. In addition to imposing new sanctions, Washington also expelled a number of Russian diplomats and closed two Russian diplomatic compounds in Maryland and New York.\n\nSo why didn't Obama's administration do more?\n\nThat isn't clear. Some former administration officials who have talked about it publicly have reproached themselves for not acting more aggressively. There also was a long-standing criticism of Obama that his foreign-policy making amounted to endless process with no outcomes \u2014 hours of meetings that yielded more meetings but no ultimate action.\n\nPlus, the relationship between the United States and Russia is multifaceted and often intensely complicated:\n\nObama scaled back missile defense plans in Europe to placate Moscow.\n\nObama wanted Russia to play a role in the international agreement under which Iran agreed to restrict its nuclear program \u2014 and Putin went along.\n\nObama spent the end of his presidency trying to bring Russia into a multilateral agreement to end the Syrian civil war, but Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov ultimately never committed.\n\nSo Obama's team had to manage many spinning plates in addition to the active measures campaign it detected by the middle of 2016. One question Obama may address in his book is why he calibrated his choices in the way he did \u2014 whether he looked the other way on election interference to keep open other options elsewhere.\n\nA partisan tightrope\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden also has complained that the White House wanted Republicans to join in a bipartisan statement announcing and condemning the interference campaign. In Biden's telling, however, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., wouldn't go along.\n\nBut that didn't stop then-Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., from alluding publicly to the Russian campaign in a letter to then-FBI Director James Comey. And Comey reportedly wanted to announce the active measures in an op-ed column, as Newsweek reported in March 2017. Two sources with knowledge about the matter told Newsweek that Obama administration officials blocked the effort.\n\nThere's no way to know what difference it might have made for U.S. officials to have confirmed and condemned the Russian interference in real time.\n\nObama administration officials have said they worried about appearing to put their thumb on the scales for Clinton. Combined with Obama's belief that Clinton would win, their political calculus appears to have boiled down to: Let's ride this out.\n\nObama himself said in December 2016 that he wasn't convinced that he should have done anything different.\n\n\"There have been folks out there who suggest somehow if we went out there and made big announcements and thumped our chests about a bunch of stuff, that somehow it would potentially spook the Russians,\" he said. \"I think it doesn't read the thought process in Russia very well.\"\n\nFACT CHECK: The intelligence community did not make an assessment about how the active measures campaign affected the 2016 election. Trump and supporters have sometimes said incorrectly that the report found there was no effect; in fact, it did not address the question. Homeland Security officials did conclude that cyberattacks didn't tamper with vote tallies in 2016.\n\nWhy aren't Democrats under investigation?\n\nSome of them may be. FBI special agents in Arkansas are reportedly conducting an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. But Trump and his allies, especially Republicans in the House, want more. They say this story is about abuse of power by the FBI and Justice Department and \"bias\" within those agencies against the president.\n\nTrump wants Attorney General Jeff Sessions to do more work to expose those aspects of the story. He may, but so far Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein have said they don't see enough cause to appoint a second special counsel in addition to Mueller.\n\nWhy is Trump under investigation?\n\nPart of Russia's active measures campaign included clandestine overtures from human intelligence operatives to people in the Trump campaign. When the FBI learned that a junior foreign policy adviser in London got offers of \"dirt\" on Clinton or \"off the record\" meetings with top Russian officials, it began a counterintelligence investigation that continues to this day.\n\nSeveral other people in the Trump campaign had contacts with Russians before and after Election Day. Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. received an email that included what was described as an offer of help for the campaign from the Russian government.\n\n\"If it's what you say, I love it,\" Trump Jr. wrote back.\n\nHe later hosted a delegation that included a Russian attorney and a Russian-American lobbyist; the details of what took place in the meeting are disputed.\n\nMore contacts took place. An adviser traveled to Moscow. Other contacts involved Sessions \u2014 then an Alabama senator, who now serves as attorney general but is lately the target of Trump's ire \u2014 and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, who today is dueling behind the scenes with White House chief of staff John Kelly.\n\nThe contacts continued until just before the inauguration. As Obama was imposing punitive measures against Moscow following the election, Trump's administration-in-waiting was asking its Russian interlocutors not to retaliate.\n\nRetired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, Trump's national security adviser, asked Russia's then-ambassador to the U.S. to hold off because it could expect a different approach once Trump was inaugurated. Putin agreed.\n\nThere have also been suggestions that Flynn and the Trump administration planned not only to renegotiate financial restrictions with Moscow once Trump was in office but had already decided before the fact to lift sanctions.\n\nFlynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the conversations he had with Russia's ambassador and is cooperating with Mueller's investigation.", "keywords": ["officials", "election", "fact", "check", "russian", "obama", "campaign", "interference", "administration", "2016", "active", "trump", "didnt", "measures", "stop", "russias"], "polarity": 0.04008700809548266, "subjectivity": 0.33116730256560784},

So much Hennessy is being sold, in fact, that one New Hampshire official is asking state Attorney General Gordon MacDonald to investigate whether the Liquor Commission is turning a blind eye to bootlegging and money-laundering activities.\n\nNew Hampshire, despite its pronounced libertarian streak, is one of 17 \"control\" states, meaning the government manages the distribution of spirits. The state's Liquor Commission, which is run by an appointed chairman, oversees 79 retail stores.\n\nAndru Volinsky, a Democrat who serves on the state's five-member Executive Council, an elected body that serves as a kind of watchdog over the executive branch, made the allegations public last month.\n\nAfter being tipped off by a whistleblower, Volinsky says, he recently witnessed two people arriving in a vehicle with New York license plates and spending approximately $24,000 on Hennessy products. At the register, they allegedly divided the sale into three transactions and paid using \"a very large wad of cash.\" He suspects people are buying up large quantities of New Hampshire's tax-free booze to sell elsewhere.\n\nThe IRS requires businesses to document when someone spends more than $10,000 in cash on a single purchase. By allowing customers to break up the transactions, the Liquor Commission may be evading that reporting requirement, Volinsky contends. He is also concerned that the Liquor Commission isn't doing enough to police customers who may stop at multiple stores in a single day to avoid triggering the $10,000 reporting requirement.\n\nThese practices \"may be illegal and unquestionably facilitate money laundering,\" writes Volinsky in a letter to the governor and state attorney general.\n\nLiquor Commission denies allegations\n\nThe New Hampshire Liquor Commission is a cash cow, generating more than $150 million in profits last year that went directly into the state's general fund. These government-run liquor stores are strategically located near the state's borders, including at highway rest stops, where motorists can enjoy tax-free shopping and better prices than in nearby Vermont and Massachusetts.\n\nAccording to publicly available online inventories, those border stores stock huge quantities of Hennessy products. Meanwhile, just a handful of bottles may be on the shelves at stores located far from the border.\n\nIt isn't clear why Hennessy appears to be the brand of choice for bootleggers, but the price difference between New Hampshire's bottles and the highly taxed New York bottles is likely one draw. Also, government officials have offered anecdotal evidence that some of the spirits are headed for Chinese restaurants, as well as gentlemen's clubs in the greater New York City region.\n\n\"I started hearing anecdotes of people coming in with wads of cash stuffed in their socks,\" Volinsky tells New Hampshire Public Radio. \"Wads of cash that smell of perfume because on Wednesdays, apparently the strip club owners in New York come over to buy their liquor in bulk, and the office of the liquor store smells from the perfume.\"\n\nFor its part, the Liquor Commission flatly denies Volinsky's allegations.\n\n\"There's nothing illegal or unscrupulous about making large sales to out-of-state customers as long as our employees follow the policies in place set forth by the state and federal government,\" writes the commission in a statement. It has provided employees with a step-by-step guide to ensure that financial disclosure laws are appropriately followed.\n\nThe commission, along with top Republicans in the state including Gov. Chris Sununu, have gone on the attack, criticizing Volinsky for his \"sting operation,\" and are calling for the attorney general to investigate him.\n\nPrevious investigation\n\nWhile a partisan tit-for-tat was perhaps inevitable, many of the concerns raised by Volinsky are not new to New Hampshire officials or to law enforcement in neighboring states.\n\nIn fact, in 2012, it was a top GOP lawmaker who called for a special House committee to investigate potential wrongdoing within the Liquor Commission, including how it handles large cash purchases.\n\nThat committee's final report included two anecdotes of out-of-state residents arrested in Massachusetts with large hauls of New Hampshire-purchased booze. One of those arrests included 1,676 bottles of Hennessy, bought at multiple locations. The driver was charged with possessing untaxed liquor and unlawfully transporting liquor.\n\nMore recently, liquor enforcement officials in Vermont have made two arrests, one involving an estimated $40,000 worth of New Hampshire-purchased liquor in the back of an SUV, the other with an estimated $28,000 worth. Both suspects were charged with crossing state lines in possession of more than 9 liters of alcohol, Vermont's current legal limit.\n\n\"The product that was the most prominent in both of these cases was Hennessy cognac,\" says Patrick Delaney, Vermont's commissioner of liquor control, who backs increasing the financial penalties for those caught illegally importing large quantities of liquor. He adds that \"by using cash, there is obviously no paper trail, if an authority were to investigate it. The activity itself is basically tax evasion.\"\n\nAn IRS spokesperson says the agency is \"aware of this and similar schemes\" but wouldn't confirm any active investigation into all-cash bulk transactions in New Hampshire.\n\nPotential repercussions\n\nPoliticians are not the only ones asking questions. Some employees of New Hampshire liquor stores are raising concerns about their role in processing these transactions.\n\n\"They are starting to feel like a drug dealer,\" says Richard Gulla, president of the State Employees Association, the union that represents rank-and-file liquor store employees.\n\nTo handle the huge stacks of cash and speed up transactions, the Liquor Commission has installed 20 bill-counting machines at stores around the state and says it plans to roll out more units.\n\nVolinsky sees these steps and others taken by the Liquor Commission as \"alarming.\"\n\nThe state attorney general's office says it is reviewing the documents submitted by Volinsky and isn't yet able to comment on their content.\n\nNHPR's Casey McDermott contributed to this report.", "keywords": ["hennessy", "state", "selling", "cash", "york", "large", "taxfree", "hampshires", "volinsky", "liquor", "commission", "hampshire", "stores"], "polarity": 0.12165384777035265, "subjectivity": 0.43873050897322724},

The Florida Senate approved a bill last weekend that would cover lost wages for first responders with PTSD, and the House followed suit on Monday.\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott is now saying he will sign the bill.\n\n\"I intend to sign it as soon it makes it to my desk,\" Scott said, speaking at an event to honor firefighters who died in the line of duty. \"What this will do is ensure firefighters suffering from PTSD can receive workers' comp benefits.\"\n\nAbout a third of states have similar laws. Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis, also the state fire marshal, called PTSD a \"hidden killer.\"\n\n\"This benefit is needed so we ensure that our firefighters don't have this as their only option, our first responders don't look to suicide as the outlet to sort through the demons they deal with and these horrific images,\" Patronis said.\n\nChanging the law has not been easy. Legislation was introduced after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando two years ago. That shooting left 49 people dead. At least three first responders to the shooting have publicly disclosed that they have been diagnosed with PTSD.\n\nThe bill languished in Florida's Republican-dominated Legislature last year, and a related measure's prospects had been uncertain this year. The Florida League of Cities, for example, raised concerns about the costs to local governments that pay for police and fire departments.\n\nI have good days, and I have really bad days, and everything in between. Every day, I walk through a different part of hell and have to figure out how to navigate it.\n\nBut after the Feb. 14 high school shooting in Parkland, in which 17 people died, opposition to the bill faded.\n\nBefore the final floor vote, state Rep. Matt Willhite looked up to the gallery where Linda Benoway was watching. Willhite told her he was sorry.\n\nBenoway's son Stevie LaDue, 55, died by suicide in September. Before his retirement after 30 years as a Tampa firefighter, he tried to get workers' comp because of PTSD. When the state denied his claim, he had to go back to work and pay back the time he missed.\n\n\"Why I say I'm sorry to you is because the system failed you, and prior to today, we failed you,\" Willhite said. \"Your son, this may have saved his life.\"\n\nAfter Willhite spoke, the bill passed unanimously.\n\nThe bill also comes too late for Josh Vandegrift, a firefighter and paramedic in the city of Cocoa.\n\nVandegrift was just starting a 24-hour shift in July 2016 when the call came in: A pedestrian had been hit by a vehicle about 100 yards from his station.\n\nVandegrift and other firefighter paramedics responded by ambulance, and Vandegrift cleared bystanders out of the way.\n\n\"I looked down and I saw my brother's face on the patient,\" he said.\n\nNate Vandegrift, his younger brother, had been hit by a commercial van crossing the street. Josh Vandegrift began to treat his brother before being removed from the scene by police officers. \"I remember just absolutely losing it in the middle of the road.\"\n\nNate Vandegrift died about eight hours after the accident. Since then, Josh Vandegrift has had nightmares and flashbacks. He avoids the intersection if possible.\n\nDoctors diagnosed Vandegrift with PTSD. He took his sick time and vacation time, and when that ran out, co-workers donated their sick time to him. When that ran out in August 2016, he applied for workers' compensation. His claim was denied.\n\n\"I had to go back to work or resign, basically,\" said Vandegrift, who returned to work. \"I have good days, and I have really bad days, and everything in between. Every day, I walk through a different part of hell and have to figure out how to navigate it.\"\n\nVandegrift, one of dozens of first responders who have answered WMFE and ProPublica's request to hear from first responders suffering from PTSD, won't benefit from the new law. The legislation will cover people who make a workers' comp claim after Oct. 1, 2018, as long as the triggering event was within the prior year.\n\nThat means Parkland first responders could be covered, but not Vandegrift and responders to the Pulse nightclub shooting. Vandegrift said he knew before he started advocating for the law that it likely wouldn't apply to him.\n\n\"If anything happens in the future, something is in place now so nobody will have to go through what I went through,\" Vandegrift said. \"You know, to be able to get out of bed in the morning.\"\n\nWMFE and ProPublica are investigating PTSD and suicides in first responders as part of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network.

He writes in his new book, \u201cFaith: A Journey For All\u201d:\n\nSunday mornings were for Sunday School and preaching at Plains Baptist Church, where Daddy was a teacher and a deacon. I remember vividly that after church we always had the best meal of the week, usually fried chicken, mashed potatoes, hot biscuits, and vegetables from our big garden, followed by pies made from sweet potatoes or fruits of the season. Afterward, our activities were severely limited. There were no stores open, movies in the county seat were out of the question, and shooting a gun or playing cards was prohibited. Fishing in the nearby creek or pond was a close call, but eventually it came to be permitted if done discreetly. It would not have been appropriate, however, to walk down a public road with a fishing pole. My mother and father played cards, mostly bridge, but certainly not on Sunday. At the age of twelve, when I was deemed old enough to drive a car by myself, my sisters and I went back to the church on Sunday evenings for meetings of the Baptist Young People\u2019s Union (BYPU). This was very important, because it was the BYPU that sponsored most of the teenage social events. I need not go on, since the picture is fairly clear. It was a simple, family-centered, deeply religious, working existence\u2026\n\nBut his faith has been tested, perhaps most recently in 2015, when Carter announced he\u2019d been diagnosed with melanoma skin cancer that spread to his brain.

Brown/Getty Images Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images\n\nWarning: This post contains language that some people may find offensive.\n\n\"I think companies are purposely putting out noticably racist ads so they can get more views,\" Chance the Rapper posted on Twitter after seeing a recent ad for light beer.\n\nIn it, as reggae music plays, a light-skinned bartender slides a bottle across the bar, past three black people (one playing a guitar), to a light-skinned customer.\n\nIt ends with the tagline, \"Sometimes, lighter is better.\" The company Chance called out, Heineken, has since pulled the spot, globally.\n\nYouTube\n\nThough it may have been lost amid the noise of media reactions to Chance's recognition of what he saw as the ad's racist subtext, which was then amplified by its subsequent disavowal by the company, Chance's point was a good one.\n\nIn a statement provided to NPR, Heineken says it \"missed the mark\" but did not respond to a question about whether the ad was purposefully controversial.\n\nIn the end, it may not really matter. Could having a Grammy-winning artist pillory your brand for being racist actually be beneficial?\n\nAs the old adage goes, \"All press is good press.\"\n\nIn 2014, Adweek looked at a study that suggested negative headlines \u2014 for instance, several media outlets reporting that a rap star accused a brand of being subtly racist \u2014 have a 63 percent higher click-through rate than positive ones.\n\nA recent study from the Pew Research Center found that nearly a quarter of Americans are on Twitter and that more than two-thirds are on Facebook.\n\nThe combination presents a useful overlap for a brand, even if it is the subject of negative attention \u2014 if a \"controversy\" is stoked on Twitter, and news outlets are posting their articles about that controversy to Facebook, it's reasonable to assume a large audience would be scooped into paying attention to it, relative to the one an ad could have hoped for in the first place. As a 2014 working paper from Harvard Business School titled, \"The Rising Cost of Consumer Attention.\" put it: \"Before consumers can be affected by advertising messages, they need to first be paying attention.\"\n\nIt later poses the question: \"How can brands create ads so compelling that consumers actively seek them out?\"\n\nChance's tweet, and media coverage of it, presents one way. Remember: Fyre Festival, that doomed experiment in entrepreneurial and excess hubris, began as nothing more than an expensive social media marketing campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, the fuzzy practice of translating the value of people seeing your advertisement versus reading about your company through an article, what is called \"advertising value equivalency,\" is not particularly well-regarded by professionals and has largely fallen out of favor as a metric, according to the Public Relations Society of America. Moreover, advertising value equivalency relies on an outdated equation that depended on comparing the total square inches a brand would receive in a physical magazine and then extrapolating its value based on the advertising rates for that publication.\n\nThe sweet spot, regardless, would be media coverage of a brand's advertisement \u2014 just as Chance pointed out.\n\nThere are recent-ish examples of a similar situation. Last fall, a soap brand was forced to express, like Heineken, its \"regret\" over a racially insensitive ad showing a black person washing her skin and revealing it to be white. A year ago, Pepsi's grandiose ad featuring Kendall Jenner was so laughably out-of-touch that its rollout was halted, all but forcing Saturday Night Live to parody it. And on Wednesday, an egregious example from Groupon was added to the pile.\n\nYouTube\n\nIn a media landscape with only one common denominator \u2014 fragmentation \u2014 getting people's shattered attention spans to focus on one place for any amount of time is a win. Even if that win is achieved by failing.\n\n\"In truth, it might not matter whether they 'meant; to do this or not, when the outcome is the same,\" writes Ian Bogost, an editor at The Atlantic and a media studies professor, in an email to NPR Music. \"The commercial probably had a much greater effect even though it was technically pulled than it might have had otherwise.\"\n\nBogost had similar thoughts around Pepsi's own experience with failing upwards last year.\n\n\"It's a trap: Let the ad lie and risk its seemingly racist message to continue,\" Bogost says, \"or draw attention to it and spread the marketing message far further than it would have reached. There's no good move.\"\n\n\"I didnt wanna tweet about it so bad ... but its like how can u not,\" Chance wrote.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Heineken stock was up \u2014 that isn't proof that it was positively impacted by the controversy, but it certainly shows it wasn't hurt by it.

It asks, is this person a citizen of the United States? This is the first time the census has included a citizenship question since the 1950s. And more than 160 mayors have signed a letter that says the question may lower participation by immigrants and compromise the results of the census, which is used to figure government services and legislative boundaries. Greg Stanton is the mayor of Phoenix, Ariz., and joins us now. Mr. Mayor, thank you so much for being with us.\n\nGREG STANTON: It's great to be here.\n\nSIMON: You signed this letter. What's your concern about how this question might affect your city?\n\nSTANTON: Well, the purpose of the census, of course, is to get an accurate count of all people who are here in the United States of America. And a question about citizenship will inevitably result in a significant undercount, will have the impact of having many, many people who are here in our country be concerned about answering those questions - likely then not answering those questions, not participating in the census. And by doing so, we won't get an accurate count. And we won't be able to distribute those important federal dollars evenly throughout the country.\n\nSIMON: And how do you answer the concern that among the jobs the census has to figure is how many people might reside in the United States who might not be citizens?\n\nSTANTON: Well, the primary job of the census is to get an accurate count of the number of people who are here, not to play politics or to get involved in the controversial issues as it relates to immigration. It's to try to get an accurate count.\n\nSIMON: From your perspective, Mr. Mayor, help us understand what federal programs you're most worried about in your city.\n\nSTANTON: Well, look. As a mayor of a major American city, I want to fight for every dollar that the people of our community deserve. So whether it be dollars related to Medicaid so that working families and poor families can get the health care that they deserve, whether it be CDBG - Community Development Block Grant, which supports great nonprofits building our neighborhoods so they can be as strong as possible. What about LIHEAP, which is the Low Income Energy Assistance Program? In Phoenix, it gets really hot, and that heat can be deadly. And if they don't have that energy assistance, it can really harm a family. So that's just a flavor of a few of the programs that I'm passionate about.\n\nSIMON: Have you gotten any kind of bipartisan support, Mr. Mayor?\n\nSTANTON: We just found out over the last few days that this question is going to be added. And I think once more Arizonans figure this out, what's at risk, what we could lose as a state, I'm confident that both political leadership and business leadership and nonprofit community and people that represent our neighborhoods throughout our city and state - they're going to come together and say this is simply not fair or appropriate to the state of Arizona. And if you love our state - and I do love our state - you've got to make sure that the census is fair and captures everyone. And we shouldn't politicize it and add questions that will inevitably lead to an undercount.\n\nSIMON: Greg Stanton is the mayor of Phoenix. Thanks so much for being with us.\n\nSTANTON: Thank you so much. Have a good one.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

It often isn't diagnosed immediately after a tragedy.\n\nBeing hyper vigilant and startling easily are normal reactions to experiencing or witnessing trauma like the Parkland scene. It becomes a disorder if the symptoms don't subside in a month or two, or start causing trouble at home or at work.\n\nRight now, Florida law allows first responders to get medical coverage under workers' compensation if they get PTSD on the job. But if they need time off for treatment, or if the PTSD becomes disabling, they must also have a physical injury to have their salaries covered.\n\nA bill to address that failed last year, and was on an uncertain path before Parkland.\n\nCarlos Guillermo Smith, who represents Orlando in Florida's state legislature, supports it.\n\n\"Many of the first responders from the mass shooting in Parkland are going to need this bill,\" he said during a recent committee debate. \"Some of them probably don't even know it yet.\"\n\nUntil now, the bill's main sticking point had been financial. The Florida League of Cities estimated it would cost between $15 million and $95 million to include PTSD as a qualifying condition for workers' comp, assuming first responders take between six months and a year off to recover. The organization cited the price tag as it lobbied against the bill.\n\nThat drew an angry rebuke from Jimmy Patronis, Florida's chief financial officer who is also the state's fire marshal. In a statement, Patronis called the League's opposition to the bill \"disgraceful\" and called its report \"wrought with flawed and erroneous data, to support why they don't care about the first responders who make up the communities they represent.\"\n\nAfterwards, David Cruz, a lobbyist with the Florida League of Cities, backed off. His organization now supports the bill.\n\nOne of the most outspoken advocates for change has been Jessica Realin. Her husband Gerry Realin was diagnosed with PTSD after spending at least four hours inside Pulse nightclub, preparing and transporting the 49 dead.\n\nHe was in the heat of summer, wearing a hazmat suit with no helmet, and his boots turned yellow, then red, from the blood and gore.\n\nWhen Jessica Realin heard there were still bodies inside the school the day after the Parkland shooting, she cried. \"It reminded me of my husband, and just him reiterating how they needed to get them out,\" she said.\n\nAbout a year passed before Gerry Realin was granted a disability pension from the Orlando Police Department, outside the Florida workers' compensation system. He sued the department within the state's workers' comp system for about $26,000.\n\nJudge of Compensation Claims Neal Pitts ruled against Realin in January.\n\n\"If he had sustained even a minor accompanying physical injury, he would be entitled to both medical and indemnity benefits,\" Pitts wrote. \"To change this outcome would require action by the Legislature, should they deem it necessary.\"\n\nFinal votes on that action are set for Monday.\n\nRep.

So much Hennessy is being sold, in fact, that one New Hampshire official is asking state Attorney General Gordon MacDonald to investigate whether the Liquor Commission is turning a blind eye to bootlegging and money-laundering activities.\n\nNew Hampshire, despite its pronounced libertarian streak, is one of 17 \"control\" states, meaning the government manages the distribution of spirits. The state's Liquor Commission, which is run by an appointed chairman, oversees 79 retail stores.\n\nAndru Volinsky, a Democrat who serves on the state's five-member Executive Council, an elected body that serves as a kind of watchdog over the executive branch, made the allegations public last month.\n\nAfter being tipped off by a whistleblower, Volinsky says, he recently witnessed two people arriving in a vehicle with New York license plates and spending approximately $24,000 on Hennessy products. At the register, they allegedly divided the sale into three transactions and paid using \"a very large wad of cash.\" He suspects people are buying up large quantities of New Hampshire's tax-free booze to sell elsewhere.\n\nThe IRS requires businesses to document when someone spends more than $10,000 in cash on a single purchase. By allowing customers to break up the transactions, the Liquor Commission may be evading that reporting requirement, Volinsky contends. He is also concerned that the Liquor Commission isn't doing enough to police customers who may stop at multiple stores in a single day to avoid triggering the $10,000 reporting requirement.\n\nThese practices \"may be illegal and unquestionably facilitate money laundering,\" writes Volinsky in a letter to the governor and state attorney general.\n\nLiquor Commission denies allegations\n\nThe New Hampshire Liquor Commission is a cash cow, generating more than $150 million in profits last year that went directly into the state's general fund. These government-run liquor stores are strategically located near the state's borders, including at highway rest stops, where motorists can enjoy tax-free shopping and better prices than in nearby Vermont and Massachusetts.\n\nAccording to publicly available online inventories, those border stores stock huge quantities of Hennessy products. Meanwhile, just a handful of bottles may be on the shelves at stores located far from the border.\n\nIt isn't clear why Hennessy appears to be the brand of choice for bootleggers, but the price difference between New Hampshire's bottles and the highly taxed New York bottles is likely one draw. Also, government officials have offered anecdotal evidence that some of the spirits are headed for Chinese restaurants, as well as gentlemen's clubs in the greater New York City region.\n\n\"I started hearing anecdotes of people coming in with wads of cash stuffed in their socks,\" Volinsky tells New Hampshire Public Radio. \"Wads of cash that smell of perfume because on Wednesdays, apparently the strip club owners in New York come over to buy their liquor in bulk, and the office of the liquor store smells from the perfume.\"\n\nFor its part, the Liquor Commission flatly denies Volinsky's allegations.\n\n\"There's nothing illegal or unscrupulous about making large sales to out-of-state customers as long as our employees follow the policies in place set forth by the state and federal government,\" writes the commission in a statement. It has provided employees with a step-by-step guide to ensure that financial disclosure laws are appropriately followed.\n\nThe commission, along with top Republicans in the state including Gov. Chris Sununu, have gone on the attack, criticizing Volinsky for his \"sting operation,\" and are calling for the attorney general to investigate him.\n\nPrevious investigation\n\nWhile a partisan tit-for-tat was perhaps inevitable, many of the concerns raised by Volinsky are not new to New Hampshire officials or to law enforcement in neighboring states.\n\nIn fact, in 2012, it was a top GOP lawmaker who called for a special House committee to investigate potential wrongdoing within the Liquor Commission, including how it handles large cash purchases.\n\nThat committee's final report included two anecdotes of out-of-state residents arrested in Massachusetts with large hauls of New Hampshire-purchased booze. One of those arrests included 1,676 bottles of Hennessy, bought at multiple locations. The driver was charged with possessing untaxed liquor and unlawfully transporting liquor.\n\nMore recently, liquor enforcement officials in Vermont have made two arrests, one involving an estimated $40,000 worth of New Hampshire-purchased liquor in the back of an SUV, the other with an estimated $28,000 worth. Both suspects were charged with crossing state lines in possession of more than 9 liters of alcohol, Vermont's current legal limit.\n\n\"The product that was the most prominent in both of these cases was Hennessy cognac,\" says Patrick Delaney, Vermont's commissioner of liquor control, who backs increasing the financial penalties for those caught illegally importing large quantities of liquor. He adds that \"by using cash, there is obviously no paper trail, if an authority were to investigate it. The activity itself is basically tax evasion.\"\n\nAn IRS spokesperson says the agency is \"aware of this and similar schemes\" but wouldn't confirm any active investigation into all-cash bulk transactions in New Hampshire.\n\nPotential repercussions\n\nPoliticians are not the only ones asking questions. Some employees of New Hampshire liquor stores are raising concerns about their role in processing these transactions.\n\n\"They are starting to feel like a drug dealer,\" says Richard Gulla, president of the State Employees Association, the union that represents rank-and-file liquor store employees.\n\nTo handle the huge stacks of cash and speed up transactions, the Liquor Commission has installed 20 bill-counting machines at stores around the state and says it plans to roll out more units.\n\nVolinsky sees these steps and others taken by the Liquor Commission as \"alarming.\"\n\nThe state attorney general's office says it is reviewing the documents submitted by Volinsky and isn't yet able to comment on their content.\n\nNHPR's Casey McDermott contributed to this report.", "keywords": ["hennessy", "state", "selling", "cash", "york", "large", "taxfree", "hampshires", "volinsky", "liquor", "commission", "hampshire", "stores"], "polarity": 0.12165384777035265, "subjectivity": 0.43873050897322724},

She saw your daughter get shot. And when rescue came, they didn't take her with them.'\"\n\nIt would be 12 excruciating hours before an FBI agent finally confirmed to the Schentrups that their daughter was among the 17 dead.\n\n\"I think part of me just broke,\" April says, weeping as she recalls that moment.\n\n\"And even as devastating as it was, I kept thinking, 'At least one of my children came home that day.' And it's sad to think that I'm thankful that one out of two of my children came home from school.\"\n\nAs April breaks down, her children, Evelyn and Robert, lean in close, knitting their fingers around her hand.\n\nUltimately, the Schentrups learned what happened in Carmen's classroom that day.\n\nThe gunman shot out a window in the class door.\n\nHe stuck the barrel of his semi-automatic, assault-style rifle through and fired, bullets flying everywhere.\n\nCarmen was struck four times.\n\n'It's unimaginable, but ... we need to imagine it'\n\nHer father Philip's voice shakes with anger and grief as he speaks of the aftermath.\n\n\"People constantly say to me, 'I can't imagine what you're going through,'\" he says. \"Well you should. You should try to comprehend your daughter \u2014 who you are so proud of, and who was just beginning to live her life \u2013 being riddled by bullets. Being told, when the medical examiner gives the body back to the funeral home, 'You can't see her. We have to spend days working on her body. And maybe, maybe you'll be able to see her then.'\"\n\n\"Think about that,\" Philip urges. \"And then come tell me why we can't do things to keep our kids safe.\"\n\n\"It's unimaginable, but I think we need to imagine it,\" April says. \"I know we need to act. We need to do something more than pray and console each other.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Melissa Block/NPR Melissa Block/NPR\n\nWith more urgency than ever before, the Schentrups support gun control measures such as banning the sale of assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines.\n\nThey want to see loopholes in background checks closed.\n\nThey talk about their views with family members who are gun owners and NRA members, and admit that those conversations can be painful.\n\nAfter Carmen was killed, Philip recalls what he heard from a close relative: \"'Sorry, but this is the way it is. This is our second amendment right.'\"\n\n\"Then I walk away,\" he says.\n\n\"On the other hand,\" April adds, \"we had another family member right when this incident happened tell me, 'We have this type of gun in our home, and we no longer want it.'\"\n\nThe Schentrups have little patience for the argument that it's the shooter that's the problem, not the weapon.\n\n\"You can say it's the man \u2013 sure,\" Philip says. \"But in the end, if we allow him to have the gun that can fire indiscriminately large amounts of bullets, that's on us. We let that happen.\"\n\n\"Yes, whether you call him crazy or just evil, he's the guy who pulled the trigger. We put a gun in his hand, or allowed him to have a gun in his hand.

Heller, which determined the Second Amendment allowed an individual right to bear arms. Stevens says he remains convinced that decision was wrong and debatable and provided the National Rifle Association with \"a propaganda weapon of immense power.\"\n\nStevens' call for repeal of the Second Amendment goes further than most gun control advocates, many of whom have called for banning certain types of weapons and establishing stricter background checks and age limits but for not changing the Constitution.\n\nStevens' proposal immediately lit up Twitter and social media.\n\nAt least one of the Parkland, Fla., students, Cameron Kasky, reacted to Stevens' op-ed arguing it was \"very interesting considering who wrote it,\" but \"I don't feel the same way.\"\n\nA mass shooting last month at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland left 17 people dead and is the catalyst for the \"March for Our Lives\" movement.\n\nWhile Stevens claimed such an action would \"be simple,\" it likely would be anything but.

And this week, we want to talk about the relationship between police and the communities they serve again.\n\nAnd it's a topic which is in the news again because of what happened in Sacramento almost two weeks ago. Twenty two-year-old Stephon Clark was fatally shot by officers who said they thought he had a gun. He didn't. There was a cellphone in his hand. There was an emotional funeral service this week, and protests are continuing.\n\nWe wanted to talk about this with people who have been talking about this and working on these issues and the issues raised by this latest shooting, so we've called Berry Accius (ph). He's a community activist in Sacramento and founder of Voice of the Youth - that's a mentorship program for young people in Sacramento. Berry,\n\nthanks so much for talking to us.\n\nBERRY ACCIUS: How are you doing? It's Berry Ax-ee-us (ph).\n\nMARTIN: Ax-ee-us, got you.\n\nACCIUS: You've got it now.\n\nMARTIN: Oh, got you - Accius, thanks so much for the correction. Also with us, Ron Hampton. He's a retired, longtime Washington, D.C., police officer. He's the immediate former executive director of the National Black Police Association. He's with us via Skype, as is Berry.\n\nRon Hampton, thank you so much for joining us again.\n\nRON HAMPTON: Thank you very much for having me.\n\nMARTIN: Also with us, Sue Rahr. She was a former sheriff of King County in Washington state. She's becoming known for her efforts to change the way police officers are trained. And Sue Rahr is also with us via Skype. Sue, thank you so much for joining us once again.\n\nSUE RAHR: Thanks for having me.\n\nMARTIN: So let me start with this basic question. The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was asked about the Sacramento case and the case of Alton Sterling, who was killed in Baton Rouge in 2016 in front of a convenience store where he'd been selling CDs. And it was just announced last week that the officers in Baton Rouge would not face any criminal charges, although one of the officers involved in the shooting will be fired. And this is what Sarah Sanders had to say about that.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nSARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS: It's certainly a terrible incident. This is something that is a local matter, and that's something that we feel should be left up to the local authorities at this point.\n\nMARTIN: So let me just start by asking if anybody agrees with her that these are essentially local matters that should be handled locally. Berry, can I start with you on that? What do you think?\n\nACCIUS: I mean, when you see a presidency that has ran like a joke, as this one is, what you expect is exactly those kind of answers. There's nothing local about this. It's a nationwide epidemic of police officers killing black people. And it has been going on historically, so I don't see how we would sit there and try to define it as just being a local thing.\n\nAnd the unfortunate part of it is until these police officers are held accountable by - whether it's our president, whether it's the folks in the legislation or the folks locally who have some kind of power to be able to do something to these officers to get justice for these people that they killed, we're going to continue to have the same thing. And like I said, I've said numerous times, we have to change that police bill of rights.\n\nMARTIN: OK, let's - let me ask Sue and Ron because both of you have served in local departments, both of you for long periods of time. Sue, local issue or national issue?\n\nRAHR: It's going to be a little bit of both. All of the mechanisms in our structure of criminal justice - all the authority rests at the local level. However, traditionally, the federal government has been active in supporting training and reform measures. So it's not just one or the other, but the accountability in our system is at the local level.\n\nMARTIN: And Ron Hampton?\n\nHAMPTON: Well, yeah. There's a role for both the local level and the federal level. What we have been able to depend on in the past, dependent on the administration, was that the federal government represented the hammer, and they didn't hesitate to bring it down. And we needed the kind of remedial also kind of action that the federal government will provide through consent decrees, memorandum of agreements, through lawsuits, through individuals with a hundred years of experience coming in talking about restructuring the police department.\n\nBecause - and that's - I used the term restructuring because I think reform hasn't worked. We - reform is something that we do around the edges. To restructure the police department is the kind of things that we need to do, and now that we don't have a Justice Department to come in and look at, evaluate and analyze the policies and practices of these local agencies, then I think we are going to be in some real serious trouble.\n\nMARTIN: Well, I want to - that's actually where I want to go next on this, which is what do you think would make a difference? And I do want to - just to reinforce the point that Ron Hampton just made - that the Justice Department had been in the Baton Rouge, the Alton Sterling case in Baton Rouge, the Justice Department had been investigating, but they closed the investigation back in May of 2017. The Louisiana attorney general just closed their investigation as well, saying the officers acted reasonably.\n\nBut as we said earlier, the police department says that one of the officers is fired and - will be fired, and the other will be disciplined. So let's move into the question that both - that all of you really have started talking about, which is, what would make things different? What would make a difference? So I'm going to ask you to start here because you've gotten a national reputation for talking about training. What do you think should be different? Or should anything be different?\n\nRAHR: Well, I think there's a couple of things. Obviously, training is absolutely critical. And of the 18,000 police departments in this country, half of them have less than 10 officers. Many of those have completely inadequate training budgets. So that's one problem. The other challenge is this system was designed to be controlled at the local level, so all of the authority rests with the city councils or the county councils or whatever the local form of government is, and that's where the decision making is about how much - what's going to be devoted to training police officers.\n\nWe also can't lose sight of the policy implications. A lot of these conversations, if you stand on the sidelines, it sounds like the police departments are operating independently. That is not the case. The policy direction comes from the elected officials. And I would point you to the Ferguson incident. When we dug deeper, we found that many of the problems reached far beyond the police department.\n\nMARTIN: Ron Hampton, what about you?\n\nHAMPTON: Well, I think everything that the sheriff says is absolutely true. I also have been a police officer. Some of the problem is in the actual training of police officers. See, and I think, to some extent, for example, that police officers do exactly what they're trained to do. And in saying that - like, using weapons, you know - they're also taught how to use a weapon, but they also train to be able to know how to justify using the weapon. And so we have even seen some of that, you know.\n\nAnd let me give you a quick example. In the thing that just happened in Sacramento, you listen to the tape, and I think they said, stop, police or something like that. But they also - what we hear police officers saying now since we've got tape and video of them, we hear them say things like gun, gun, gun. And see, so if there's a - if whether there's a gun or not, we don't know. But by them using the term gun, it gets recorded, and now that's justification for them to use their weapon in terms of the shooting and use deadly force.\n\nSo what we have to do - I think what we have to do is if we want to train police officers to be - it was brought up on television the other night that if you look at the dangerous factors of being a police officer in this country, I think it's number 14. And they list all of the things.\n\nMARTIN: OK.\n\nHAMPTON: So we're number 14. But the fact of the matter is, is that, yeah, we - there is a danger that exists to it, but training and education is designed to reduce the danger because it educates and trains the officers in terms of how they get around that and what to do.\n\nMARTIN: Let's get Berry back. OK, thanks. Let's get Berry back in here. Berry, tell us what - you brought up something earlier that you said was important, which is the police officers' bill of rights. Talk a little bit more about that and whatever else you feel would make a difference.\n\nACCIUS: And, well, first of all, the police never said that they were police officers in that moment when Mr. Clark - and I think that's some of those situations when we look at how police are policing the community, they kind of run rogue. And because of the police bill of rights - as they have said, I mean, it almost leaves the police untouchable because they have so many things that create scrutiny.\n\nWhere we would look at a videotape or where we would look at an incident and say, oh, well, that's excessive force, well, in those bill of rights, they're kind of protected. And in that motion, when you're sitting there saying gun, or where you're sitting there saying, I feared for my life, right there, you could almost automatically say that that police officer is going to pretty much walk.\n\nMARTIN: Can I...\n\nACCIUS: So I think...\n\nMARTIN: Go ahead.\n\nACCIUS: ...A lot of what happens is we have way too many police officers that, one, aren't drug tested enough. I believe that they should be drug tested after a lethal shooting or a non-lethal shooting. And - as well as, every third month, have psych evals. Because we know the pressures our police have, but we're not getting the things that they need to keep them sane. So I think when we constantly figure and go on and on and on without kind of checking in with our police officers, just expecting that they're OK - I think that kind of creates a recipe for disaster.\n\nMARTIN: Well, I just want to thank you all for joining us, and I realize we don't have enough time for this very, you know, important conversation. You know, I'm sorry that we keep having it, but we're going to continue to have it until we don't need to have it. So I hope I'll talk with you all again, and I hope it's under better circumstances. But I'm pretty confident we will be talking again.\n\nThat's Berry Accius. He's a community organizer in Sacramento.

Ron, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nRON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.\n\nSIMON: President Trump was in Ohio on Thursday. He was expected to talk about his infrastructure plan. Crowd got a little something different, didn't they?\n\nELVING: You know, the staging was just fine. There were lots of shiny, new, colorful hard hats, but the president had been cooped up for several days with no public appearances, and he apparently needed to vent. So Ohio got a flashback to 2016. The president talked about Syria and Korea and NASA and Obamacare and Hillary and immigration and Roseanne Barr's new show and how well that's doing. And he did say that we had spent trillions and trillions building up foreign countries while allowing our own infrastructure to fall into total disrepair. But he did not talk much about his own plans for actual roads and bridges.\n\nSIMON: Is it just hard to do that right now, or he goes with the crowd? What happens?\n\nELVING: Infrastructure is a subject he likes to mention but not dwell upon. And at this point, he has given us the outline of a big program for roads and bridges, but it relies on the states and private companies to put up most of the money and make it happen. So infrastructure just doesn't seem to engage his imagination the way foreign policy does.\n\nSIMON: And about that Syria pledge - are U.S. military leaders concerned at what seems to be a pretty spontaneous vow to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria will just give back the territory to ISIS and its allies?\n\nELVING: Military leaders don't have news conferences to dictate policy, but they have said again and again, and sometimes in public, that they think that they need to stay in Syria until ISIS is utterly eradicated there. Now, the president said in Ohio that we would be out, quote, \"like very soon.\" And that has stirred concern within the ranks.\n\nSIMON: The president mentioned his ouster of Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin. Some members of the Trump administration had signaled that for some time. Mr. Shulkin, of course, is a holdover from the Obama administration. And there have been questions about some of his travel, but it seems that there are other reasons, too.\n\nELVING: The president mentioned only the issue of efficiency in the VA. But Shulkin himself says that other players in the administration in the White House wanted him and the VA to move faster in getting private sector care for vets as an alternative to the VA. And there are some vets who get some private care now. But there are powerful elements within the administration and outside the administration who want to be much more aggressive in moving in that direction, and both Shulkin and his deputy are opposed to privatization and wanted to protect the idea of the VA, as we've noted.\n\nSIMON: President Trump appointed as his replacement doctor and Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson, a White House physician. Some people have questioned his qualifications to lead a major federal agency. And I wonder, does this spotlight questions that have been raised about the qualifications of - we can list the many people in Mr. Trump's Cabinet?\n\nELVING: Ronny Jackson has been the White House physician under three presidents. He's best known for that January news conference in which he praised President Trump's health, said he could easily serve in healthy two terms. But it does raise again the issue of personal chemistry over conventional qualifications.\n\nSIMON: NPR's Ron Elving, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nELVING: Thank you, Scott.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

Dianne Feinstein could finish her speech at the California Democratic Party convention Saturday, the music began playing to indicate she had used her allotted time.\n\nShe kept talking. The music got louder. \"I guess my time is up,\" Feinstein conceded as what sounded like a 1940s movie score continued playing.\n\nWithout missing a beat, supporters of her opponent, state Sen. Kevin de Le\u00f3n echoed her statement in a chant: \"Your time is up! Your time is up!\" \u2014 a not-so-subtle reference to Feinstein's 25 years in the U.S. Senate.\n\nIt was a sign of things to come. The grass-roots Democratic activists gathered at the party's annual convention in San Diego this weekend implicitly rebuked the state's senior U.S. senator by denying her the party's endorsement for her re-election bid.\n\nFeinstein finished far behind de Le\u00f3n, the top Democrat in the state Senate. De Le\u00f3n received 54 percent of delegates' votes to just 37 percent for Feinstein. It takes 60 percent to receive an endorsement.\n\nWhile the lack of an endorsement certainly won't keep Feinstein off the ballot, it's a sign that grass-roots Democrats are eager to supplant leaders who are seen as too moderate and willing to compromise.\n\nDemocratic Party activists have never really been Feinstein's people. In 1990, when she was running for governor, she came to the party convention and expressed her support for the death penalty, eliciting boos from the liberal crowd. She lost the party endorsement to John Van de Kamp but got the nomination anyway, ultimately losing the November election to Pete Wilson.\n\nFeinstein has always been a little to the right of where the party's activists are. Now, at age 84 and in her final campaign, Feinstein is once again at odds with progressives, despite her efforts to move left by more strongly opposing President Trump's agenda.\n\nShe said the Senate Appropriations Committee, which she sits on, would never approve $25 billion for Trump's wall along the Mexico border. But minutes later, de Le\u00f3n's team sent texts noting that Feinstein had just voted for exactly that as part of the \"Common Sense Coalition\" immigration plan that failed to get through the Senate.\n\nThe bill would not only have provided a path to citizenship for so-called Dreamers, people in the U.S. illegally who were brought here as children, but it also included $25 billion for the wall.\n\nFeinstein also reminded the crowd of her longstanding leadership on gun control, including her success against long odds at getting an assault weapons ban signed into law in 1994.\n\nIn his speech to the convention, de Le\u00f3n reminded the crowd that his opponent hasn't always been a reliable liberal. \"Democrats, you'll never have to guess where I stand,\" de Le\u00f3n said before noting that he has championed issues such as raising the minimum wage, single-payer health care and the environment.\n\n\"Moral clarity is always doing the right thing when no one is watching,\" he said. \"And it should never take a primary challenge to stand up for California values.\"\n\nAs leader of the state Senate, De Le\u00f3n has had his own problems of late, most notably criticism of his slow response to the sexual harassment scandal in Sacramento. And while an endorsement from the Democratic Party would have provided a boost, his campaign is also overshadowed by Feinstein's huge advantages in name recognition and campaign cash. A recent poll from the Public Policy Institute of California had her leading de Le\u00f3n by 46 percent to 17 percent.\n\nDespite the boost for De Le\u008f\u00f3n, the vote is in some ways a loss for him. Democratic campaign strategist Katie Merrill says he needed the endorsement much more than Feinstein.\n\n\"He was such a narrow path to the Senate, and he had to have this Democratic Party endorsement,\" she said. \"This was the one strategic thing he need to accomplish here and he did not accomplish it.\"", "keywords": ["state", "democrats", "decline", "feinstein", "democratic", "senate", "dianne", "sen", "term", "endorse", "le\u00f3n", "endorsement", "convention", "party", "california", "campaign"], "polarity": 0.09360119047619048, "subjectivity": 0.5169047619047618},

It often isn't diagnosed immediately after a tragedy.\n\nBeing hyper vigilant and startling easily are normal reactions to experiencing or witnessing trauma like the Parkland scene. It becomes a disorder if the symptoms don't subside in a month or two, or start causing trouble at home or at work.\n\nRight now, Florida law allows first responders to get medical coverage under workers' compensation if they get PTSD on the job.

The Florida League of Cities estimated it would cost between $15 million and $95 million to include PTSD as a qualifying condition for workers' comp, assuming first responders take between six months and a year off to recover. The organization cited the price tag as it lobbied against the bill.\n\nThat drew an angry rebuke from Jimmy Patronis, Florida's chief financial officer who is also the state's fire marshal. In a statement, Patronis called the League's opposition to the bill \"disgraceful\" and called its report \"wrought with flawed and erroneous data, to support why they don't care about the first responders who make up the communities they represent.\"\n\nAfterwards, David Cruz, a lobbyist with the Florida League of Cities, backed off. His organization now supports the bill.\n\nOne of the most outspoken advocates for change has been Jessica Realin. Her husband Gerry Realin was diagnosed with PTSD after spending at least four hours inside Pulse nightclub, preparing and transporting the 49 dead.\n\nHe was in the heat of summer, wearing a hazmat suit with no helmet, and his boots turned yellow, then red, from the blood and gore.\n\nWhen Jessica Realin heard there were still bodies inside the school the day after the Parkland shooting, she cried. \"It reminded me of my husband, and just him reiterating how they needed to get them out,\" she said.\n\nAbout a year passed before Gerry Realin was granted a disability pension from the Orlando Police Department, outside the Florida workers' compensation system. He sued the department within the state's workers' comp system for about $26,000.\n\nJudge of Compensation Claims Neal Pitts ruled against Realin in January.\n\n\"If he had sustained even a minor accompanying physical injury, he would be entitled to both medical and indemnity benefits,\" Pitts wrote. \"To change this outcome would require action by the Legislature, should they deem it necessary.\"\n\nFinal votes on that action are set for Monday.\n\nRep.

But not even the combined talents of the secretaries of Transportation, Commerce, Labor, Agriculture and Energy seemed enough to move the ball on the $1.5 trillion plan, and it remains unclear whether the measure will ever find its way to a vote in the House or Senate.\n\nSenate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee chairman John Thune, R-S.D., said he was hopeful that \"both sides can come together on this and it can happen this year.\"\n\nBut several unanswered questions remain, chief among them where the $200 billion in federal funding would come from and where states would find the remainder of the money.\n\nThe Trump plan commits $200 billion in federal funding over 10 years to stimulate state and local spending and private investment. Half of the funding, $100 billion, would be used as incentives to entice cities, counties and states to raise at least 80 percent of the infrastructure costs themselves.\n\nThat's a departure from the way many projects are funded now. Funding for federal-aid highways, including interstates, is usually allocated in an 80-20 federal-state split. So, President Trump's plan would flip that funding burden. Major mass transit projects are often funded on a 50-50 federal-local basis. Again, the administration's plan puts a much greater burden on local taxpayers and users.\n\nEstimates vary but the American Society of Civil Engineers has opined that there is a $2 trillion investment gap when it comes to the country's infrastructure needs.\n\n\"How are you gonna get members of the Senate to vote for the tax revenue in order to pay for these plans?,\" asked Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., the ranking Democrat on the panel. \"We can't toll our way out,\" he said. Nelson suggested that the recently-enacted tax cut be changed from a 21-percent corporate rate to 25 percent to pay for infrastructure, a non-starter as far as most Republicans are concerned.\n\nTransportation Secretary Elaine Chao said that with some estimates as high as $4 trillion to repair the nation's roads, bridges, ports and airports, \"We cannot address a challenge of this magnitude with federal resources alone, or by borrowing.\" She said the administration was \"agnostic\" about where the state share of the funds would come from, but said the federal government only owns 10 percent of the nation's roads and bridges, implying it was up to state and local governments to figure out where to find the funds to finance their share of improvements.\n\nSeveral states have already raised their gas taxes to fund road repairs, and others have instituted new tolls.\n\nSen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., said Congress and the administration have \"got the identification of the problem down cold,\" adding the challenge is \"how we're going to pay for it.\" The administration's plan, he said was \"just smoke and mirrors.\"\n\nAddressing criticism that the administration only released an outline of what it hopes to see in an infrastructure plan, Chao said the administration sent Congress a list of principles rather than specific legislation in \"an open show of cooperation.\" She said the administration wants to work with Congress \"and not be prescriptive\" with specific legislative language.\n\nOne of the key principles for the administration, said Energy Secretary Rick Perry, was removing regulatory barriers to speed approval of construction projects. Perry called the current permitting process fractured and redundant, saying \"it requires projects to navigate a huge maze of federal regulations.\" Perry said Trump wants to see the process streamlined and \"substantially cut back.\"\n\nWednesday morning, the president tweeted thanking the Senate committee for helping with his effort to improve the nation's infrastructure. The president wrote that the nation's infrastructure was \"crumbling,\" and said \"We need to build FAST & we need to build for our FUTURE.\"", "keywords": ["nations", "plan", "secretaries", "push", "cabinet", "trillion", "congress", "administration", "funding", "projects", "way", "trump", "federal", "infrastructure"], "polarity": 0.03296226150392817, "subjectivity": 0.37083613916947245},

They're real people who get trained and paid to spread propaganda.\"\n\nTumblr sent an email to users identifying accounts with which they may have interacted, but it wasn't clear Monday how much effect the Russian users had over the social media platform.\n\nLast year, Tumblr was credited with about 345 million accounts and many more individual users, but there was no immediate information about what kind of total reach the Russian accounts may have had.\n\nThe largest part of the social media agitation aspect of Russia's active measures campaign probably involved Facebook. It illustrated how a comparatively small effort can achieve larger effects across a network.\n\nRussian influencemongers bought a relatively small number of paid ads on Facebook and Instagram, which Facebook owns, but once they had been shared and users began seeing more free content, about 150 million people saw some Russian material, the social media giant said.\n\nBlack users and Black Lives Matter were a target on Facebook as well, according to Mueller's indictment. The best-known account, \"Blacktivist,\" and others sought to divide black users from within. In another example from Mueller's indictment, Internet Research Agency influencemongers used the Instagram account \"Woke Blacks\" to encourage followers not to vote for any candidate in 2016.\n\n\"[A] particular hype and hatred for Trump is misleading the people and forcing Blacks to vote Killary. We cannot resort to the lesser of two devils. Then we'd surely be better off without voting AT ALL,\" a post from the account said.\n\nThis aspect of Russia's active measures continued a decades-long practice of targeting race inside the United States.\n\nMore recently, there have been indications that influencemongers piggybacked on real users' protests about news coverage of the Austin bombings \u2014 which critics said got short shrift because some of its victims were black \u2014 as well as last year's NFL protests, the violence in Charlottesville, Va., and other stories.\n\nTumblr said that it didn't think Russian influencemongers bought any paid ads on its platform. The service said it discovered only human-posted and shared material and urged users to take care.\n\n\"They want to drive a wedge between us so that we spend our time fighting with each other instead of building towards the future,\" Tumblr's post said. \"We'll be watching for signs of future activity, but the best defense is knowing how they operate and how to judge the content you see.\"", "keywords": ["facebook", "black", "ban", "americans", "users", "social", "accounts", "tumblrs", "media", "adds", "russian", "influencemongers", "targeting"], "polarity": 0.06538600288600291, "subjectivity": 0.3802489177489178},

We were Southern but poor sharecroppers rather than slave owners,\" Hart tells NPR special correspondent Michele Norris, founder of The Race Card Project. \"Other stereotypes my family embraces, using discriminatory language in equal measure across all those who are not white Southerners.\"\n\nThe term \"white trash\" shows up fairly often in the six-word submissions for The Race Card Project, Norris says, as do words like hillbilly, redneck, hayseed and bumpkin. \"People are sometimes writing about pain, sometimes they're using humor to distance themselves from the pain, sometimes it's associated with a kind of nostalgia,\" Norris says. For Hart, it may just be all of those things.\n\nBut when it comes to \"white trash,\" she is probably on the fringe. Hart is a water resource economist at the World Bank in an intellectually elite environment where her colleagues might be surprised to hear her describe herself this way.\n\nRaised outside of Houston, Texas, she spent summers visiting family in the South. Often, these family members were just getting by, like her great-uncle Reece Billings, who lived near Independence, Va.\n\n\"He died within the last 10 years, never having had indoor plumbing, never having had electrical wiring in his house, never having had a telephone line to his house,\" she says. \"The water for the kitchen came from the stream through a PVC pipe, then dumped into a sink and then there was an egress PVC pipe that took it back to the stream downhill. And that was the only running water in the house.\"\n\nHart's grandmother grew up in that house. Hart has come some distance from that now.

But within the family using it is OK.\"\n\nFor those in the Deep South, she says, the term has been embraced by a significant part of poor people who feel misunderstood. \"They feel misunderstood because of the heavy legacy of slavery and segregation and poverty,\" she says. \"And I think part of their feeling misunderstood is to take on or embrace that term, which is self-denigrating but it also says, 'We've been hurt, too.' \"", "keywords": ["race", "members", "family", "water", "white", "im", "tobaccopickin", "term", "hart", "trash", "yes", "shes", "words"], "polarity": 0.11236933797909407, "subjectivity": 0.332026713124274},

But one group in particular has had a major increase well before that - the National African American Gun Association. Their numbers tripled after the inauguration of President Donald Trump. Philip Smith founded the group in 2015. And he joins us from Atlanta. Mr. Smith, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nPHILIP SMITH: Thanks for having me today.\n\nSIMON: And why did you create this National African American Gun Association rather than just join the NRA?\n\nSMITH: I wanted a voice for our community where we could feel comfortable to gather, a place where we could come and learn about firearms together in a very peaceful and nonthreatening environment.\n\nSIMON: You're a gun owner.\n\nSMITH: Yes, I am.\n\nSIMON: May I ask what kind of guns you own?\n\nSMITH: I have a AK-47. I have a Glock 19. I have a Glock 17. And I have the - as of late, I've got a hunting 783 Remington.\n\nSIMON: Why an AK-47?\n\nSMITH: It's a good gun. It serves a purpose. It's really good for self-defense purposes. And I think it's a very solid tool to have.\n\nSIMON: What's your analysis, Mr. Smith - maybe from conversations with some of your membership - as to why you had this terrific increase in membership right after President Trump's inauguration?\n\nSMITH: Well, I think it's a three-headed monster. I think, one, people are looking at, you know, the state of the United States in terms of robberies, burglaries, things that are happening on your daily basis. Two, I think also - probably just as important - we see what's happening around the world. You know, terrorism is something that scares black folks just like anybody else. So we are aware of that. But also, we look at what's happening in the political arena in terms of the conversations and the types of conversations. We see folks that were on the fringes of society, let's say, eight, nine, 10 years ago. But they're now out front talking about various things that are somewhat disturbing.\n\nSIMON: When you say people on the fringes of society, let me chance to be blunt. Do you mean white racists?\n\nSMITH: I think there are some individuals out there that have negative views of African-Americans. They have gotten bolder and bolder in their conversations in terms of our place in society. We're getting too progressive. Or we're moving too much up the ladder in society, so they want to kind of keep us down. When we hear those things - and me being a black man - your alarms go off. And you say, you know what? I think the days of us sitting back and just turning the other cheek - I think those days are long gone.\n\nSIMON: Mr. Smith, how do you and the African American Gun Association feel about stricter gun laws?\n\nSMITH: From the organizational standpoint, we believe that if you're a violent person and you beat your wife, you never need to own a gun. If you have a violent felony, you never need to have a gun. And a third piece - if you on - are the no-fly list, you need to not have a gun for any shape, form or reason.\n\nSIMON: And what about the argument - I'm sure you've heard - that putting more guns in the hands of more people just adds fuel to a fire that's burning up parts of America?\n\nSMITH: Well, see. I disagree with that argument. And I do hear that particular perspective, and I respect it. I believe that the best way to stop someone with a gun other than law enforcement is to have a gun yourself. I think too often as African-Americans we've been told to not arm ourselves. And I think too often we are just sitting back and letting someone come and save us. If you look at our communities right now across the country, they are in a wreck because we cannot protect those communities. These communities are just literally wide-open markets for violence, and that needs to change.\n\nSIMON: What do you say, Mr. Smith, to those people who might point out that, actually, urban crime has been going down in the United States for a generation?\n\nSMITH: I would say this. If you look at urban areas such as LA or east LA or South Chicago - and there's a lot of gun violence in those areas. Let's be blunt. The reason those areas are having issues are the following - anytime you take a group of young men - black, white or any color - put them in an area in which they have a confrontational relationship with the police and, on top of that, give them no economic skills that can be transferable into 2018, and I'll tell you what's going to happen. All those gentlemen and ladies are going to be very, very frustrated. And they're going to do what they have to do to survive. If that means killing folks and shooting folks, unfortunately, that's what's going to happen. That's what's driving gun violence in certain areas throughout the U.S. It's not because it's the gun. It's that these folks, that these brothers don't have any recourse for anything viable that's going to allow them to have a skill to provide for themselves and their family.\n\nSIMON: Philip Smith is president and founder of the National African American Gun Association.

That this really was an issue that was occurring in high schools across the country, and that we really needed to look at a new solution.\"\n\nAnd he challenged her to come up with one.\n\nOne of the biggest questions in education is whether it's even possible to turn around a low-performing school. The Obama administration spent $7 billion on school turnarounds, and their final verdict was that nothing really worked.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Elissa Nadworny/NPR Elissa Nadworny/NPR\n\nThe solution Jerabek developed is called the BARR method, for Building Assets, Reducing Risks. And, she has an unusual amount of evidence. Out of 172 projects in a big federal innovation grant program, BARR is the only one that progressed through randomized controlled trials to win grants at all three levels: innovation, development and scale-up.\n\nThe ninth-grade shock\n\nBARR doesn't require changing the teachers or the students in a school. It doesn't overhaul the curriculum or discipline. It doesn't require flashy technology. It's based on something simple, and decidedly unsexy: meetings.\n\nJerabek decided to focus her efforts on freshman year. Many students stumble in the transition to high school \u2014 more than any other year of school. A failing grade in that first year significantly raises your risk of dropping out. And that, in turn, can shadow your entire life. Just from one F grade. Researchers call this the \"ninth-grade shock.\"\n\nSo, Jerabek figured out a way that all the adults in a school building could come together to try to cushion that shock.\n\nUp on the third floor here at St. Louis Park, there's a room with no windows, but inspirational posters and free candy on the table. We're here for the weekly block meeting. Here, teachers who share the same group of students sit down over a shared Google doc with the school support staff: the social worker, the counselor, sometimes even the police officer assigned to the school.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Elissa Nadworny/NPR Elissa Nadworny/NPR\n\nThe core of the BARR method is these meetings, where educators talk about three things. First, the data \u2014 on attendance, behavior and grades. Alex Polk, a science teacher, observes of one student: \"She's been late at least 19 times and is late with the same group of people each time.\"\n\nSecond, the big picture of the students' lives. Daniel Perez, the school social worker, shares his notes from meetings with students: \"He and his mom don't get along, he feels ignored by her, Dad is not in the picture, he does not have friends here at Park and he is not interested in making friends.\"\n\ntoggle caption Elissa Nadworny/NPR\n\nFinally, they come up with a personalized plan for what to do to help each student, like signing them up for tutoring, calling home or holding a mediation.\n\nTjessa Arradando, a sophomore who loves chemistry and writes for the school paper, explains how BARR worked for her.\n\n\"I have anxiety, so if I was stressed I'd go down to the counselor's office and they would kind of talk to me, come up with a plan on how to, you know, adjust at certain times.\" She had a pass to get out of class; the counselors let the teachers know about her needs, so Arradando felt like all the adults were on her side. This year, she says, she's managing much better.\n\ntoggle caption Elissa Nadworny/NPR\n\nBuilding a fuller picture of a student\n\nIn most schools, teachers meet regularly to talk about subject areas or administrative duties. In BARR schools, the point of block meetings is to pool knowledge on students. Most teachers only see a student for no more than 45 minutes a day, Jerabek points out. They may not have the background knowledge to understand what is really going on when a student is acting out.\n\nSometimes, piecing together information creates a startling picture.\n\ntoggle caption Elissa Nadworny/NPR\n\nAt a BARR school in California, one teacher raised a concern about a specific group of 14-year-old girls that tended to sit with older boys rather than other freshmen at lunch. A second teacher noticed that the same girls were missing class on Mondays and Fridays. A third teacher was concerned about dress code violations. No one was particularly alarmed, but when they cross-referenced the information and followed up, Jerabek says, they discovered that the girls were being trafficked for sex.\n\nThere's a second BARR meeting each week called Risk Review, about the kids in the toughest situations. Just on one Thursday, we hear about drug issues, fears of deportation, chronic illness, eating disorders and a student who may not have a place to sleep.\n\nEven though BARR, by definition, focuses on students with problems, it also highlights strengths. Kelly Brown, the BARR coordinator at St. Louis Park, probes teachers again and again to name what's going right: like a student with a good sense of humor, say, or a supportive parent.\n\nThis is deliberate, says Jerabek: \"To be able to identify the strengths does require that you've actually built a relationship with a student.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Elissa Nadworny/NPR Elissa Nadworny/NPR\n\nThere's a classroom component to the BARR method as well, a social and emotional curriculum called iTime. It allows students and teachers to get to know each other better and, again, build positive relationships.\n\nFor example, in Kara Cisco's civics class on the day we visit, students are giving each other awards based on the Preamble to the Constitution. \"Promote the general welfare\" might be a student who shares their snacks.\n\nThis combination of hard data and soft skills has paid off. In the first year of BARR here at St. Louis Park, the failure rate for freshmen was cut in half, from 50 percent to 25 percent, and those results stuck.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Elissa Nadworny/NPR Elissa Nadworny/NPR\n\nGold-standard evidence\n\nAs BARR spread, researchers tested the model by the gold standard: randomized controlled trials. And they found over and over again, it raises test scores and pass rates, reduces absences and suspensions, and students feel more engaged and challenged at school. The effects are particularly large for students of color, male students and students from low-income families.\n\nAcross big-city schools like St. Louis Park, there's a 40 percent drop in failure rates from BARR, and in small rural schools it's 29 percent on average.\n\nThe principal here, Scott Meyers says the BARR model does cost some money, because of the adjustment in teacher schedules. And it may be harder to put in place in districts that are really hurting for support staff like counselors. But, Jerabek likes to point out, BARR shows you can make big changes without changing the students or the teachers in a school, just by focusing on relationships.\n\n\"Many students, they just work harder when they know that the adults care about them.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Elissa Nadworny/NPR Elissa Nadworny/NPR\n\nThese days, Angela Jerabek spends her time flying from Maine to California. BARR is now in 80 schools in 13 states and Washington, D.C. Over the next five years, Jerabek says, that will triple.", "keywords": ["secret", "high", "students", "caption", "student", "barr", "school", "toggle", "fixing", "elissa", "jerabek", "schools", "teachers", "meetings"], "polarity": 0.07375524268047634, "subjectivity": 0.38845069779649216},

And Hispanic-American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history.\"\n\nEarier this month, he also bragged about the latest jobs report, focusing in on minorities in particular.\n\nOn Twitter he cited that black unemployment is \"the lowest ever recorded in our country.\" And he jabbed: \"Dems did nothing for you but get your vote!\"\n\nAnd then at a speech to the American Farm Bureau Federation, he did it again, saying, \"African-American unemployment is the lowest it's ever been in the history of our records.\"\n\nPresidents often take credit for a strong economy, and Trump fits that mold, touting jobs and stock market numbers regularly. So we decided to fact-check Trump on this claim: Is he right, and are these numbers his doing?\n\nThe claim\n\nBlack and Hispanic unemployment are at or near record lows.\n\nThe short answer\n\nTrump's numbers are right, but it's generally a stretch for presidents to take credit for job creation.\n\nThe long answer\n\nTrump is right that African-American unemployment hit a record low in December. The unemployment rate for black Americans is currently 6.8 percent, the lowest level recorded since the government started keeping track in January 1972.\n\nAnd he's also right that the Hispanic unemployment rate is down a point over the last year \u2014 it was at 4.9 percent in December, down from 5.9 percent in December 2016. That is close to a record low, though it's also up 0.1 point from November.\n\nBut still, fact check: true on Trump's numbers.\n\nHowever, that's not all Trump is doing in this tweet. He is implying that he caused these low African-American and Hispanic unemployment rates.\n\nAnd a big problem with that claim is that those rates had been falling for long before Trump took office, and their declines don't appear to have picked up speed. This implies that there's nothing specific that Trump did to change this rate.\n\nIndeed, both of these rates have been falling relatively steadily since around 2010, early in President Obama's tenure in the White House.\n\nSo have the unemployment rates for all races and ethnic groups tracked by the Labor Department. In general, these unemployment rates tend to move together. So while Trump called out the African-American and Hispanic unemployment rates, they haven't changed in any remarkable way, relative to other groups' unemployment rates.\n\nSeparately, the president's Council of Economic Advisers touted the unemployment rate of other demographic groups on Friday, shortly after the latest jobs report was released.\n\n\"The overall unemployment rate, which by October had dropped to 4.1 percent, represented a 17-year low by year's end,\" they wrote. \"The benefits of the low rates were felt broadly, resulting in unemployment rates for America's veterans, African-Americans and Hispanics that reached historic lows in 2017.\"\n\nThe total unemployment rate is quite low, at 4.1 percent. That's not a record, but for comparison with that African-American rate, it is near its lowest point since 1972.\n\nSo Trump here is trying to make a political point \u2014 one that he has made before \u2014 seeming to tell minorities that they should support him more than they do. But then, the president has a decidedly uneasy relationship with black Americans, as NPR's Brakkton Booker wrote on Saturday, and his rhetoric on immigration has also upset some Hispanics.\n\nThis leads to the bigger question of how much Trump has to do with any of this job growth, regardless of race or ethnicity.\n\nBy the jobs numbers themselves, it doesn't look like he has changed much here. In fact, the average job creation in Trump's first year is slightly lower than it has been in prior years. Employers added 171,000 new jobs each month, on average, in 2017. In 2016, that figure was 187,000, and in 2015, it was 226,000.\n\nIt is possible that the tax plan that Trump recently signed into law will inspire employers to hire more. Businesses could conceivably plow some of the money they save on their taxes thanks to that plan into job creation. In a late-November Yahoo poll of more than 1,200 business owners, half said the new tax plan would make them more likely to hire.\n\nThen again, a majority of economists polled by the University of Chicago predict that long term, the tax plan won't lead to higher economic growth.\n\nIt's not that Trump has had zero effect on the economy. Though a strong global economy has been the main reason stocks are climbing ever higher, as NPR's Jim Zarroli reported in December, the president's agenda of deregulation and cutting corporate taxes has also likely very played some part in pushing stocks ever higher.\n\nBut the case that Trump has therefore significantly boosted job creation through the stock market isn't particularly strong, says one economist.\n\n\"To the extent that that affects business decisions, it may be that the president is having some impact on employment,\" said Michael Strain, director of economic studies at the American Enterprise Institute. \"But it's very important not to overstate that.\"\n\nThere's also a bigger problem with the idea that Trump has created all these jobs \u2014 presidents don't have much immediate control over the economy, period.\n\nIt's true that they push policies or make hires that can affect economic performance \u2014 George W. Bush first appointed former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, who helmed the central bank as it worked to pull the country out of recession; and President Barack Obama signed the 2009 stimulus. It's also true that at the end of any given president's tenure, we look at the job market under that president.\n\nBut there's so much about the economy that presidents don't control \u2014 business cycles and other countries' economic health, for example. The White House also can't control broader macroeconomic trends, like the U.S. economy's long-term shift from goods-producing to service-based industries.\n\nIndeed, a 2015 paper from Princeton economists Alan Blinder and Mark Watson found that while the economy has tended to grow faster under Democratic presidents, policy actions don't appear to account for that difference.\n\n\"Democrats would probably like to attribute a large portion of the D-R growth gap to better fiscal (and perhaps monetary) policies, but the data do not support such a claim,\" they wrote.\n\nSo could a president \u2014 with Congress' help \u2014 target communities with particularly high unemployment? Yes, says one expert \u2014 particularly in one policy area Trump already has been championing.\n\n\"There needs to be a deliberate attempt to retrain and recruit people into the economy through infrastructure programs,\" said Andre Perry, a fellow in the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution.\n\nWhile the unemployment rate is relatively low \u2014 near what economists call \"full employment\" \u2014 it remains true that the black unemployment rate is always much higher than the national rate. He believes that targeted infrastructure policy could reduce that gap, helping disadvantaged Americans get back to work.\n\n\"Full employment means nothing to black folk in Baltimore or St. Louis or Pittsburgh,\" Perry said. \"For far too long, black unemployment has been the sacrificial lamb of full employment, and so again, if there is an infrastructure plan put on the table, it should be targeted at populations in areas that are largely out of work. [And] not only inner-city black America; it's also rural white men who are being left behind by the economy.\"\n\nIf that's true, it seems likely to remain a hypothetical. Democrats and Republicans alike champion the idea of infrastructure, but partisan divides on how to do it remain so wide that passing an infrastructure package this year would most likely be a heavy lift.", "keywords": ["check", "unemployment", "fact", "rate", "job", "black", "low", "touts", "hispanics", "president", "economy", "africanamericans", "trump", "rates", "presidents"], "polarity": 0.10759792185928543, "subjectivity": 0.41548236906191444},

Gun policy had already become a central issue in Florida's current legislative session after the shooting. But the effects of the shooting are reaching beyond the state's borders into legislatures across the country.\n\nThere are thousands of gun-related bills in statehouses \u2014 some would expand access to guns by easing permit restrictions and others aim to take guns out of the hands of people with domestic violence convictions, mental health issues or others who pose a threat.\n\nThe recent shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that killed 17 has pushed some statehouses and state candidates deeper into the gun debate. Some are moving to bury bills that were already in the works, while others are gaining traction on measures that previously languished.\n\nHere's a look at some of what's happening in statehouses across the country.\n\nCalifornia claimed a victory on Tuesday, when the U.S. Supreme Court punted on a Second Amendment case once again. It declined to hear a challenge to that state's 10-day waiting period to buy guns, reaffirming that states have wide authority to set their own gun laws.\n\nKentucky legislators say they won't consider gun control proposals, but a bill allowing teachers and staff to be armed has gained traction, as Louisville Public Radio's Ryland Barton reported. The bill would allow schools to tap teachers and staff as school marshals, as long as they have a conceal-carry permit.\n\nIn Iowa, the Senate advanced a bill one day after the Parkland shooting requiring school districts to create active shooter safety plans, Iowa Public Radio reports. A Senate committee was also considering a bill that would have removed the permit requirement to obtain and carry weapons. The chairperson now says it's a bad time for that legislation.\n\n\"It makes me sick what happened down in Florida, but with that said, I did have the votes to move this thing forward and decided after the communication from the governor ... to pull it off the agenda,\" said Brad Zaun, a Republican from Des Moines suburb Urbandale.\n\nAn Illinois lawmaker has drafted a proposal in response to Florida's shooting to ban so-called \"ghost guns,\" which are assembled by individuals outside a factory or store. Rep. Martin Moylan, a Democrat, says he also plans to file a measure that would ban AR-15s, a popular semi-automatic rifle. As NPR Illinois reports, Moylan says he does not believe this proposal would be an intrusion on Second Amendment rights. \"Just like prohibiting people to drive 100 miles per hour in a car, there has to be rules and control.\"\n\nRepublican Ohio Gov. John Kasich has softened his stance on gun control in recent months and this week called on President Trump to pass \"common-sense gun laws.\" He recounted a conversation with a friend who owns guns on CNN. \"If all of a sudden you couldn't buy an AR-15, what would you lose? Would you feel your Second Amendment rights would be eroded because you couldn't buy a goddarn AR-15? These are things that have to be looked at and action has to happen,\" he said.\n\nIt's unclear what that action will look like in his own state, though. As WOSU reports, there are 22 pieces of legislation related to guns pending in the Ohio legislature, including bills to ban bump stocks and strengthen background checks.\n\nKucinich plans to lobby the state legislature and called for city councils to ban assault-style weapons with high-capacity magazines, WOSU reports. That will be a tough sell, though. Ohio passed a law in 2006, which was upheld by the state Supreme Court, prohibiting cities from passing restrictive gun laws like an assault weapons ban or handgun registration requirements.\n\nKansas' statehouse was considering a bill that would have instituted gun violence restraining orders like California and Washington. The legislators say now is not the right time to talk about guns.\n\nAnd as KCUR's Jim McLean reports, a Kansas congressional candidate Tyler Tannahill drew criticism online after he decided to go through with a giveaway of an AR-15 rifle, similar to the one used in the Florida shooting. Tannahill also touted a training program for arming teachers.\n\nNearly 50 gun-related bills have been introduced in Michigan since January 2017, the Detroit Free Press reports. The majority of those would expand access to guns and have stalled in committees. But Republican Rep. Jim Runestad tells the paper that a two bills dealing with removing guns from people with mental health issues could get a second look from his committee. \"What are we going to do to make sure people who are severely unbalanced are not given access to weapons?\" Runestad said.\n\nIn Idaho, bills to ease gun permitting are moving forward without hesitation. These include allowing anyone 21 or older to carry concealed weapons and allowing any Idaho resident to carry concealed weapons.\n\nIowa Public Radio's Clay Masters, KCUR's Jim McLean, Michigan Radio's Rick Pluta, WCPN's Nick Castele, KBSX's Jimmy Dawson and NPR Illinois' Brian Mackey of NPR's statehouse collaborative contributed to this report.", "keywords": ["state", "bills", "gun", "legislation", "fresh", "bill", "ban", "weapons", "shooting", "states", "guns", "look", "parkland", "reports"], "polarity": 0.036674409601238876, "subjectivity": 0.3701780874951607},

Dianne Feinstein could finish her speech at the California Democratic Party convention Saturday, the music began playing to indicate she had used her allotted time.\n\nShe kept talking. The music got louder. \"I guess my time is up,\" Feinstein conceded as what sounded like a 1940s movie score continued playing.\n\nWithout missing a beat, supporters of her opponent, state Sen. Kevin de Le\u00f3n echoed her statement in a chant: \"Your time is up! Your time is up!\" \u2014 a not-so-subtle reference to Feinstein's 25 years in the U.S. Senate.\n\nIt was a sign of things to come. The grass-roots Democratic activists gathered at the party's annual convention in San Diego this weekend implicitly rebuked the state's senior U.S. senator by denying her the party's endorsement for her re-election bid.\n\nFeinstein finished far behind de Le\u00f3n, the top Democrat in the state Senate. De Le\u00f3n received 54 percent of delegates' votes to just 37 percent for Feinstein. It takes 60 percent to receive an endorsement.\n\nWhile the lack of an endorsement certainly won't keep Feinstein off the ballot, it's a sign that grass-roots Democrats are eager to supplant leaders who are seen as too moderate and willing to compromise.\n\nDemocratic Party activists have never really been Feinstein's people. In 1990, when she was running for governor, she came to the party convention and expressed her support for the death penalty, eliciting boos from the liberal crowd. She lost the party endorsement to John Van de Kamp but got the nomination anyway, ultimately losing the November election to Pete Wilson.\n\nFeinstein has always been a little to the right of where the party's activists are. Now, at age 84 and in her final campaign, Feinstein is once again at odds with progressives, despite her efforts to move left by more strongly opposing President Trump's agenda.\n\nShe said the Senate Appropriations Committee, which she sits on, would never approve $25 billion for Trump's wall along the Mexico border. But minutes later, de Le\u00f3n's team sent texts noting that Feinstein had just voted for exactly that as part of the \"Common Sense Coalition\" immigration plan that failed to get through the Senate.\n\nThe bill would not only have provided a path to citizenship for so-called Dreamers, people in the U.S. illegally who were brought here as children, but it also included $25 billion for the wall.\n\nFeinstein also reminded the crowd of her longstanding leadership on gun control, including her success against long odds at getting an assault weapons ban signed into law in 1994.\n\nIn his speech to the convention, de Le\u00f3n reminded the crowd that his opponent hasn't always been a reliable liberal. \"Democrats, you'll never have to guess where I stand,\" de Le\u00f3n said before noting that he has championed issues such as raising the minimum wage, single-payer health care and the environment.\n\n\"Moral clarity is always doing the right thing when no one is watching,\" he said. \"And it should never take a primary challenge to stand up for California values.\"\n\nAs leader of the state Senate, De Le\u00f3n has had his own problems of late, most notably criticism of his slow response to the sexual harassment scandal in Sacramento. And while an endorsement from the Democratic Party would have provided a boost, his campaign is also overshadowed by Feinstein's huge advantages in name recognition and campaign cash. A recent poll from the Public Policy Institute of California had her leading de Le\u00f3n by 46 percent to 17 percent.\n\nDespite the boost for De Le\u008f\u00f3n, the vote is in some ways a loss for him. Democratic campaign strategist Katie Merrill says he needed the endorsement much more than Feinstein.\n\n\"He was such a narrow path to the Senate, and he had to have this Democratic Party endorsement,\" she said. \"This was the one strategic thing he need to accomplish here and he did not accomplish it.\"", "keywords": ["state", "democrats", "decline", "feinstein", "democratic", "senate", "dianne", "sen", "term", "endorse", "le\u00f3n", "endorsement", "convention", "party", "california", "campaign"], "polarity": 0.09360119047619048, "subjectivity": 0.5169047619047618},

But this year, the state legislature is going into a special session to continue discussions about whether or not to include it in its budget. By the time the regular session adjourned Saturday, members of Virginia's GOP-controlled House of Delegates and Senate could not reach agreement on whether or not to expand Medicaid.\n\nRepublican Delegate Barry Knight from the Virginia Beach area calls it \"the 800-pound gorilla in the room.\" He's one of more than a dozen Republicans who voted to include Medicaid expansion in the House budget \u2014 along with a work requirement \u2014 this year.\n\nIt's a big shift in the House position on the issue and comes after 15 seats flipped in the so-called \"blue wave\" of last November's election, which also saw the election of Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam.\n\n\"On the big-picture issues, I think it was a re-awakening and a call to look at things from a different perspective,\" says Republican Delegate Chris Peace, from the Richmond area.\n\nAt a recent rally outside the state Capitol in Richmond, Northam continued his campaign message. \"Are you all ready to get this done?\" he called to the crowd's cheers. \"Are you ready to expand coverage?\"\n\nA December poll showed over 80 percent of likely Virginia voters support an expansion.\n\n\"I think the House heard that message, loud and clear. I think the Senate still needs to listen a little bit,\" Northam says.\n\nHe's referring to a strong movement against expansion, led by Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment from the Tidewater area in southeastern Virginia. Norment has come out against the House Republicans who want to expand. He reminds them that despite a slim margin, Republicans are still in charge and could stop Medicaid expansion.\n\n\"I do think that the House of Delegates is waiting for that moment of lucidity and epiphany to realize that their majority is 51 to 49,\" Norment says.\n\nBut President Trump has managed to mobilize Democratic voters, says Bob Holsworth, a former political science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University. He thinks expansion has a greater chance this year.\n\nIt could pass in the Senate, he says, because of a potential wildcard.\n\nThat wildcard is Republican Sen. Emmett Hanger, from mostly-rural central Virginia. Hanger has expressed support for some form of Medicaid expansion, and has a track record of voting independently, says Holsworth.\n\n\"What Hanger has said that's very interesting ... is that if he decides to support some version of Medicaid expansion, he says, 'There are a number of other Republicans who are going to go over with me.' \"\n\nHowever, Hanger isn't happy about a tax on hospitals that has been incorporated into the House's budget to help pay for the state's share of expansion costs. The tax accounts for about three quarters of the over $400 million Medicaid-related gulf between House and Senate budgets.\n\nIf legislators don't come up with a budget that includes Medicaid expansion, Northam has a plan B. He says he'll introduce an amendment to add it back into the budget. In the amendment process, the lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, gets a vote if the Senate ties. Fairfax says he'd be happy to vote to expand coverage to up to 400,000 low-income Virginians.\n\n\"There are so many people that we can help and we have the means to do it if we expand Medicaid. We just have to have the political will to do it,\" Fairfax says.\n\nAmong those expansion would help in Virginia: low-income adults without children.\n\n\"An adult who does not have children can have zero income \u2014 can be totally impoverished \u2014 and they cannot get Medicaid,\" says Jill Hanken with the Virginia Poverty Law Center.\n\nAnd a family of three with a total income of about $10,000 doesn't qualify for Medicaid, she says.\n\n\"It's hard to explain to them that they don't have a choice, they're not eligible for Medicaid,\" she says, and they're not eligible for subsidies for insurance on the exchange, so health insurance is out of reach. \"And the reason is because Virginia hasn't expanded Medicaid,\" she says.\n\nThe special session begins April 11.

I'm White'\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Jamaal Allan Courtesy of Jamaal Allan\n\nNPR continues a series of conversations from The Race Card Project, in which thousands of people have submitted their thoughts on race and cultural identity in six words.\n\nPeople make a lot of assumptions based on a name alone.\n\nJamaal Allan, a high school teacher in Des Moines, Iowa, should know. To the surprise of many who have only seen his name, Allan is white. And that's taken him on a lifelong odyssey of racial encounters.\n\nThose experiences prompted him to share his six words with The Race Card Project: \"My name is Jamaal ... I'm white.\"\n\nAllan grew up in southern Oregon, in a house on 18 acres with a commune on one side and a llama ranch on the other.\n\nThe origins of his name weren't that remarkable, Allan tells NPR Special Correspondent Michele Norris.\n\n\"My parents decided they wanted less traditional names for their children. ... My dad was a Los Angeles Lakers fan and they had had a player named Jamaal Wilkes, and that name kind of came up,\" he says.\n\nHis mother \u2014 who was pregnant with Allan's sister at the time \u2014 fell in love with the sound of the name. Their parents named his sister Madera, and they named their son Jamaal \u2014 \"just to spice things up a bit, I guess,\" he says.\n\nAs Allan wrote for a blog called The Poetry Question:\n\n\"Growing up I never thought twice about my name (of course I was next door to a commune, hanging out with Orly, Oshia, Lark Song, River Rocks, Sky Blue, and more than one Rainbow). \"In a high school soccer game I was called 'a white man with a [horrific racial expletive deleted] name.' \"In January of 2002 I flew to London. I was randomly selected for additional passenger screening. It was me, Muhammad, Abdul, Tariq, and an old white haired lady named Jenny Smith. Seriously. I'm not sure what was faster, Jenny Smith's pat down or the dropping of the TSA agent's face when I responded to the name Jamaal.\"\n\nJamaal means \"beauty\" in Arabic.\n\n\"Learning the meaning behind it and, well, the beauty that comes in the sound of the name, I like that quite a bit,\" Allan says.\n\nIt's also a name that give him an unusual perspective on questions of identity, race and cultural stereotypes.\n\nWhen he goes out in Des Moines for drinks with friends who are black, the waitress or bartender often hands his debit card to someone else \u2014 someone black.\n\n\"They're making an assumption based on the name on the card and not paying attention to who handed it to them,\" Allan says. \"They say, 'Jamaal, oh that must be the black guy sitting here.' \"\n\n'We Could Use Some Diversity Here'\n\nThese kinds of assumptions also spill over into his professional life as a teacher.\n\n\"People usually don't bring it up on a first day, but after I've developed a rapport with the students and they feel comfortable having open conversations, they'll say, 'You know, when class started I thought you were going to be black,' \" Allan says.\n\nAnd he uses that as a jumping-off point for more questions: Why you would assume that and what did that mean? And were you disappointed? What were your thoughts when you actually saw me?\n\nThe question of someone's name, particularly if it has ethnic overtones, can have real consequence. One study found that after responding to 1,300 classified ads, applicants with black-sounding names were 50 percent less likely to get a callback than white-sounding names with comparable resumes.\n\nBut the opposite was at work in Allan's case. The principal who hired him told him he was lucky to get the job because they hadn't been planning to take another student teacher. Then Allan's application showed up.\n\n\"They scanned through it ... and they saw someone named Jamaal who played basketball, listed Muhammad Ali among his heroes and inspirations, and thought, 'We could use some diversity here, so let's bring this guy on, I think he'd be good for some of our younger minority male students,'\" he says. \"And, well, then I showed up.\"\n\nIf someone argued that the only reason Jamaal Allan got the job was affirmative action \u2014 well, the joke would be on them.\n\nThe school got diversity with Allan, but not necessarily the kind they thought. Not many people can say they grew up between a commune and a llama ranch.\n\n\"They said we need more diversity, we need someone who resonates well and connects with some of the young male students here,\" Allan says. \"It may not have been because of how I look, but through actions, that was exactly what they got.\"\n\nOn Allan's first day of work, he showed up at school and introduced himself to one of the secretaries.\n\n\"And she said, 'Oh, you're Jamaal, I expected you were going to be' \u2014 and there was a very long, very pregnant pause,\" Allan recalls. \"And the word she came up with was 'taller.' \"\n\n\"I just sort of chuckled and said, 'Yeah, I get reactions like that a lot.' \"", "keywords": ["race", "jamaal", "allan", "diversity", "school", "white", "im", "thought", "named", "words", "card", "allans"], "polarity": 0.07163033758104181, "subjectivity": 0.43819304717192037},

And this week, we want to talk about the relationship between police and the communities they serve again.\n\nAnd it's a topic which is in the news again because of what happened in Sacramento almost two weeks ago. Twenty two-year-old Stephon Clark was fatally shot by officers who said they thought he had a gun. He didn't. There was a cellphone in his hand. There was an emotional funeral service this week, and protests are continuing.\n\nWe wanted to talk about this with people who have been talking about this and working on these issues and the issues raised by this latest shooting, so we've called Berry Accius (ph). He's a community activist in Sacramento and founder of Voice of the Youth - that's a mentorship program for young people in Sacramento. Berry,\n\nthanks so much for talking to us.\n\nBERRY ACCIUS: How are you doing? It's Berry Ax-ee-us (ph).\n\nMARTIN: Ax-ee-us, got you.\n\nACCIUS: You've got it now.\n\nMARTIN: Oh, got you - Accius, thanks so much for the correction. Also with us, Ron Hampton. He's a retired, longtime Washington, D.C., police officer. He's the immediate former executive director of the National Black Police Association. He's with us via Skype, as is Berry.\n\nRon Hampton, thank you so much for joining us again.\n\nRON HAMPTON: Thank you very much for having me.\n\nMARTIN: Also with us, Sue Rahr. She was a former sheriff of King County in Washington state. She's becoming known for her efforts to change the way police officers are trained. And Sue Rahr is also with us via Skype. Sue, thank you so much for joining us once again.\n\nSUE RAHR: Thanks for having me.\n\nMARTIN: So let me start with this basic question. The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was asked about the Sacramento case and the case of Alton Sterling, who was killed in Baton Rouge in 2016 in front of a convenience store where he'd been selling CDs. And it was just announced last week that the officers in Baton Rouge would not face any criminal charges, although one of the officers involved in the shooting will be fired. And this is what Sarah Sanders had to say about that.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nSARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS: It's certainly a terrible incident. This is something that is a local matter, and that's something that we feel should be left up to the local authorities at this point.\n\nMARTIN: So let me just start by asking if anybody agrees with her that these are essentially local matters that should be handled locally. Berry, can I start with you on that? What do you think?\n\nACCIUS: I mean, when you see a presidency that has ran like a joke, as this one is, what you expect is exactly those kind of answers. There's nothing local about this. It's a nationwide epidemic of police officers killing black people. And it has been going on historically, so I don't see how we would sit there and try to define it as just being a local thing.\n\nAnd the unfortunate part of it is until these police officers are held accountable by - whether it's our president, whether it's the folks in the legislation or the folks locally who have some kind of power to be able to do something to these officers to get justice for these people that they killed, we're going to continue to have the same thing. And like I said, I've said numerous times, we have to change that police bill of rights.\n\nMARTIN: OK, let's - let me ask Sue and Ron because both of you have served in local departments, both of you for long periods of time. Sue, local issue or national issue?\n\nRAHR: It's going to be a little bit of both. All of the mechanisms in our structure of criminal justice - all the authority rests at the local level. However, traditionally, the federal government has been active in supporting training and reform measures. So it's not just one or the other, but the accountability in our system is at the local level.\n\nMARTIN: And Ron Hampton?\n\nHAMPTON: Well, yeah. There's a role for both the local level and the federal level. What we have been able to depend on in the past, dependent on the administration, was that the federal government represented the hammer, and they didn't hesitate to bring it down. And we needed the kind of remedial also kind of action that the federal government will provide through consent decrees, memorandum of agreements, through lawsuits, through individuals with a hundred years of experience coming in talking about restructuring the police department.\n\nBecause - and that's - I used the term restructuring because I think reform hasn't worked. We - reform is something that we do around the edges. To restructure the police department is the kind of things that we need to do, and now that we don't have a Justice Department to come in and look at, evaluate and analyze the policies and practices of these local agencies, then I think we are going to be in some real serious trouble.\n\nMARTIN: Well, I want to - that's actually where I want to go next on this, which is what do you think would make a difference? And I do want to - just to reinforce the point that Ron Hampton just made - that the Justice Department had been in the Baton Rouge, the Alton Sterling case in Baton Rouge, the Justice Department had been investigating, but they closed the investigation back in May of 2017. The Louisiana attorney general just closed their investigation as well, saying the officers acted reasonably.\n\nBut as we said earlier, the police department says that one of the officers is fired and - will be fired, and the other will be disciplined. So let's move into the question that both - that all of you really have started talking about, which is, what would make things different? What would make a difference? So I'm going to ask you to start here because you've gotten a national reputation for talking about training. What do you think should be different? Or should anything be different?\n\nRAHR: Well, I think there's a couple of things. Obviously, training is absolutely critical. And of the 18,000 police departments in this country, half of them have less than 10 officers. Many of those have completely inadequate training budgets. So that's one problem. The other challenge is this system was designed to be controlled at the local level, so all of the authority rests with the city councils or the county councils or whatever the local form of government is, and that's where the decision making is about how much - what's going to be devoted to training police officers.\n\nWe also can't lose sight of the policy implications. A lot of these conversations, if you stand on the sidelines, it sounds like the police departments are operating independently. That is not the case. The policy direction comes from the elected officials. And I would point you to the Ferguson incident. When we dug deeper, we found that many of the problems reached far beyond the police department.\n\nMARTIN: Ron Hampton, what about you?\n\nHAMPTON: Well, I think everything that the sheriff says is absolutely true. I also have been a police officer. Some of the problem is in the actual training of police officers. See, and I think, to some extent, for example, that police officers do exactly what they're trained to do. And in saying that - like, using weapons, you know - they're also taught how to use a weapon, but they also train to be able to know how to justify using the weapon. And so we have even seen some of that, you know.\n\nAnd let me give you a quick example. In the thing that just happened in Sacramento, you listen to the tape, and I think they said, stop, police or something like that. But they also - what we hear police officers saying now since we've got tape and video of them, we hear them say things like gun, gun, gun. And see, so if there's a - if whether there's a gun or not, we don't know. But by them using the term gun, it gets recorded, and now that's justification for them to use their weapon in terms of the shooting and use deadly force.\n\nSo what we have to do - I think what we have to do is if we want to train police officers to be - it was brought up on television the other night that if you look at the dangerous factors of being a police officer in this country, I think it's number 14. And they list all of the things.\n\nMARTIN: OK.\n\nHAMPTON: So we're number 14. But the fact of the matter is, is that, yeah, we - there is a danger that exists to it, but training and education is designed to reduce the danger because it educates and trains the officers in terms of how they get around that and what to do.\n\nMARTIN: Let's get Berry back. OK, thanks. Let's get Berry back in here. Berry, tell us what - you brought up something earlier that you said was important, which is the police officers' bill of rights. Talk a little bit more about that and whatever else you feel would make a difference.\n\nACCIUS: And, well, first of all, the police never said that they were police officers in that moment when Mr. Clark - and I think that's some of those situations when we look at how police are policing the community, they kind of run rogue. And because of the police bill of rights - as they have said, I mean, it almost leaves the police untouchable because they have so many things that create scrutiny.\n\nWhere we would look at a videotape or where we would look at an incident and say, oh, well, that's excessive force, well, in those bill of rights, they're kind of protected. And in that motion, when you're sitting there saying gun, or where you're sitting there saying, I feared for my life, right there, you could almost automatically say that that police officer is going to pretty much walk.\n\nMARTIN: Can I...\n\nACCIUS: So I think...\n\nMARTIN: Go ahead.\n\nACCIUS: ...A lot of what happens is we have way too many police officers that, one, aren't drug tested enough. I believe that they should be drug tested after a lethal shooting or a non-lethal shooting. And - as well as, every third month, have psych evals. Because we know the pressures our police have, but we're not getting the things that they need to keep them sane. So I think when we constantly figure and go on and on and on without kind of checking in with our police officers, just expecting that they're OK - I think that kind of creates a recipe for disaster.\n\nMARTIN: Well, I just want to thank you all for joining us, and I realize we don't have enough time for this very, you know, important conversation. You know, I'm sorry that we keep having it, but we're going to continue to have it until we don't need to have it. So I hope I'll talk with you all again, and I hope it's under better circumstances. But I'm pretty confident we will be talking again.\n\nThat's Berry Accius. He's a community organizer in Sacramento.

Kennedy's Speech After Martin Luther King's Assassination\n\nWhen Robert F. Kennedy learned of Martin Luther King's assassination in April of 1968, he gave an impromptu speech in Indiana. Decades later, it's credited with calming the devastated crowd.\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\n\nAlmost 50 years ago, April 4, 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. And his loss set off riots in dozens of U.S. cities, but not in Indianapolis. As Jill Sheridan of member station WFYI reports, that's in part because of a short impromptu speech made by a stumping presidential candidate who would himself be assassinated two months later.\n\nJILL SHERIDAN, BYLINE: In the spring of 1968, Robert F. Kennedy was late in entering the primary race for the Democratic presidential nomination. His campaign was gearing up in Indiana. On April 4, 16-year-old Teresa Lubbers tagged along with her older brother to a campaign rally. It was a cold, wet early spring evening. Lubbers says there were hundreds in the predominantly African-American crowd.\n\nTERESA LUBBERS: We were in the back, sort of - so I had a view of sort of the whole crowd.\n\nSHERIDAN: She was not alone in experiencing this shock from the news Kennedy delivered.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nROBERT F. KENNEDY: I have some very sad news for all of you, and that is that Martin Luther King was shot and was killed tonight.\n\n(SCREAMING)\n\nSHERIDAN: Abie Robinson was in the crowd that night, too. He was 24.\n\nABIE ROBINSON: The shift in my emotions swung from very angry when I heard the news about Martin Luther King's assassination to coming to the understanding of what Martin Luther King stood for.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nKENNEDY: Martin Luther King dedicated his life to love and to justice.\n\nSHERIDAN: City and state leaders had urged Kennedy to cancel his appearance, but he refused to. The words he delivered from the back of a flatbed truck didn't come from a speechwriter.\n\nROBINSON: He had it written on a little piece of paper that I'd seen him have folded up in his hand. He was able to connect and so that not only you heard the words that he said, you believe that he felt the words that he said.\n\nSHERIDAN: Reggie Jones was 27 and had brought a group of young men to hear Kennedy. He remembers fearing their reaction to the news.\n\nREGGIE JONES: So I took the guys back to School 63 on the South Side, and we played basketball from the time we got there, maybe about 10 - 10:30, to about 2 in the morning.\n\nSHERIDAN: Abie Robinson says there were others like Jones who worked to keep the peace that night.\n\nROBINSON: There were leaders from different parts of the city that were in touch with the people who would have been in that element that would be burning down your own neighborhood.\n\nSHERIDAN: There was unrest in more than 60 U.S. cities - what's now known as the Holy Week Uprising. But Indianapolis was relatively calm.\n\nRAY BOOMHOWER: I think words matter, and Kennedy's words mattered quite a bit that evening.\n\nSHERIDAN: Historian Ray Boomhower wrote a book about Kennedy's primary campaign.\n\nBOOMHOWER: He was wearing an overcoat that had belonged to his brother. And this was really the first time he had made any kind of public statement about his brother's death. You know, he said, you know...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nKENNEDY: I had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a white man.\n\nSHERIDAN: Boomhower says Kennedy appeared to draw from his own grief as he quoted a Greek poet.\n\nBOOMHOWER: And the words that he spoke, I think, had a particular impact to the crowd when he said, even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nKENNEDY: Falls drop by drop upon the heart until in our own despair, against our will comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.\n\nSHERIDAN: Those words were spoken right here in this Indianapolis park now named for King. A large memorial sculpture has two statues - Kennedy on one side of a path and King on the other, hands stretched out towards each other. Reggie Jones finds that comforting.\n\nJONES: Still reaching out - that's the hope. In spite of everything that you see, there's still hope.\n\nSHERIDAN: For NPR News, I'm Jill Sheridan.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

The Kentucky shooter killed two high school sophomores and injured 18 other people.\n\nIn the wake of the tragedy at Marshall County High School in Benton, Kentucky's Republican governor and legislature say they won't consider any gun-control proposals. Instead, a measure allowing teachers or staff to carry guns on campus has gained traction.\n\nRepublican state Sen. Steve West admits his bill isn't going to stop all school shootings, but he hopes it'll help.\n\n\"It increases that kid's chances of surviving. And if there is someone there with a weapon, they will be able to take down the assailant, or at least calm the situation,\" West said.\n\nUnder Senate Bill 103, public school boards and private schools would be able to tap teachers or staff to serve as \"school marshals,\" who would be allowed to carry a gun on campus if they have a concealed carry permit.\n\nIn Kentucky, concealed carry classes teach basic firearm mechanics and safety, but don't train participants for active shooter situations\u2014the only circumstance the bill would allow school staff to use the guns.\n\nThe weapons would have to be stored in a lockbox somewhere on school property at all other times.\n\n\"I wish honestly I didn't have to file this bill, or we weren't even having this discussion and we could go back in time.

It would not have saved lives at Marshall County High School.\"\n\nSen. West, the bill's sponsor, says he's still trying to refine the bill and considering other training requirements for the marshals.\n\n\"Fifty states truly are experiment stations for this subject. Everyone's trying to grapple with it at the same time. And the Florida situation just enhances it even more,\" West said.\n\nState Sen. Danny Carroll, a Republican whose district includes Marshall County, says he's concerned about teachers using live ammunition in active shooter situations.\n\nHe's proposed a bill that would allow teachers and staff to use non-lethal weapons that would be stored on campus.\n\n\"We're talking about beanbag shotguns, shotguns that shoot rubber pellets, rubber bullets that are shot out of a pistol or a rifle, tranquillizer guns, the flashbang devices that you often see on TV when a SWAT teams make an entrance into a house,\" Carroll said.\n\nMany Kentucky schools already have armed \"school resource officers,\" often off-duty police officers charged with protecting students.\n\nThere was an armed guard at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, just as there was last month at Marshall County High School.

Gun policy had already become a central issue in Florida's current legislative session after the shooting. But the effects of the shooting are reaching beyond the state's borders into legislatures across the country.\n\nThere are thousands of gun-related bills in statehouses \u2014 some would expand access to guns by easing permit restrictions and others aim to take guns out of the hands of people with domestic violence convictions, mental health issues or others who pose a threat.\n\nThe recent shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that killed 17 has pushed some statehouses and state candidates deeper into the gun debate. Some are moving to bury bills that were already in the works, while others are gaining traction on measures that previously languished.\n\nHere's a look at some of what's happening in statehouses across the country.\n\nCalifornia claimed a victory on Tuesday, when the U.S. Supreme Court punted on a Second Amendment case once again. It declined to hear a challenge to that state's 10-day waiting period to buy guns, reaffirming that states have wide authority to set their own gun laws.\n\nKentucky legislators say they won't consider gun control proposals, but a bill allowing teachers and staff to be armed has gained traction, as Louisville Public Radio's Ryland Barton reported. The bill would allow schools to tap teachers and staff as school marshals, as long as they have a conceal-carry permit.\n\nIn Iowa, the Senate advanced a bill one day after the Parkland shooting requiring school districts to create active shooter safety plans, Iowa Public Radio reports. A Senate committee was also considering a bill that would have removed the permit requirement to obtain and carry weapons. The chairperson now says it's a bad time for that legislation.\n\n\"It makes me sick what happened down in Florida, but with that said, I did have the votes to move this thing forward and decided after the communication from the governor ... to pull it off the agenda,\" said Brad Zaun, a Republican from Des Moines suburb Urbandale.\n\nAn Illinois lawmaker has drafted a proposal in response to Florida's shooting to ban so-called \"ghost guns,\" which are assembled by individuals outside a factory or store. Rep. Martin Moylan, a Democrat, says he also plans to file a measure that would ban AR-15s, a popular semi-automatic rifle. As NPR Illinois reports, Moylan says he does not believe this proposal would be an intrusion on Second Amendment rights. \"Just like prohibiting people to drive 100 miles per hour in a car, there has to be rules and control.\"\n\nRepublican Ohio Gov. John Kasich has softened his stance on gun control in recent months and this week called on President Trump to pass \"common-sense gun laws.\" He recounted a conversation with a friend who owns guns on CNN. \"If all of a sudden you couldn't buy an AR-15, what would you lose? Would you feel your Second Amendment rights would be eroded because you couldn't buy a goddarn AR-15? These are things that have to be looked at and action has to happen,\" he said.\n\nIt's unclear what that action will look like in his own state, though. As WOSU reports, there are 22 pieces of legislation related to guns pending in the Ohio legislature, including bills to ban bump stocks and strengthen background checks.\n\nKucinich plans to lobby the state legislature and called for city councils to ban assault-style weapons with high-capacity magazines, WOSU reports. That will be a tough sell, though. Ohio passed a law in 2006, which was upheld by the state Supreme Court, prohibiting cities from passing restrictive gun laws like an assault weapons ban or handgun registration requirements.\n\nKansas' statehouse was considering a bill that would have instituted gun violence restraining orders like California and Washington. The legislators say now is not the right time to talk about guns.\n\nAnd as KCUR's Jim McLean reports, a Kansas congressional candidate Tyler Tannahill drew criticism online after he decided to go through with a giveaway of an AR-15 rifle, similar to the one used in the Florida shooting. Tannahill also touted a training program for arming teachers.\n\nNearly 50 gun-related bills have been introduced in Michigan since January 2017, the Detroit Free Press reports. The majority of those would expand access to guns and have stalled in committees. But Republican Rep. Jim Runestad tells the paper that a two bills dealing with removing guns from people with mental health issues could get a second look from his committee. \"What are we going to do to make sure people who are severely unbalanced are not given access to weapons?\" Runestad said.\n\nIn Idaho, bills to ease gun permitting are moving forward without hesitation. These include allowing anyone 21 or older to carry concealed weapons and allowing any Idaho resident to carry concealed weapons.\n\nIowa Public Radio's Clay Masters, KCUR's Jim McLean, Michigan Radio's Rick Pluta, WCPN's Nick Castele, KBSX's Jimmy Dawson and NPR Illinois' Brian Mackey of NPR's statehouse collaborative contributed to this report.", "keywords": ["state", "bills", "gun", "legislation", "fresh", "bill", "ban", "weapons", "shooting", "states", "guns", "look", "parkland", "reports"], "polarity": 0.036674409601238876, "subjectivity": 0.3701780874951607},

Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the committee, called the Republican decision to shut down the investigation a \"terrible disservice to the country and the American people,\" in announcing the release of a 21-page \"status report\" that laid out the Democrats' case to continue the probe.\n\n\"The decision to shut down the investigation before key witnesses could be interviewed and vital documentary evidence obtained will prevent us from fully discharging our duty to the House and to the American people,\" the report from the Democrats says.\n\nIt then lays out a long list of witnesses the committee hadn't yet interviewed or gotten enough documents from as of Monday, when Republicans on the committee deemed the investigation complete.\n\nThe GOP members concluded that staffers of the Trump campaign who met with Russians may have displayed bad judgment, but nothing worse. The report affirmed that Russia was actively waging an \"active measures\" information campaign against the United States leading up to the 2016 election, but notably disputed that the Russian efforts were intended to help Trump win.\n\nSchiff appeared with fellow intelligence committee Democrats on Capitol Hill Tuesday evening and said the Republicans had put forth a \"pretense of trying to find the truth.\"\n\n\"We are going to do our best to continue our work. There are individuals who want to cooperate with our committee and share information, and will continue to do so,\" Schiff said. \"We will be putting together a report that will set out for the country what evidence we have seen to date.\"\n\nThe Democrats' retort is broken up into four sections:\n\nBroad concepts the Democrats feel haven't been adequately investigated, like what is still necessary in terms of election security U.S. in the future, as well as more specific lines of questioning like \"Did President Trump seek to obstruct the FBI's investigation into Michael Flynn by pressuring FBI Director Comey to drop the investigation, by repeatedly requesting his loyalty, and by firing him?\"\n\nWitnesses the committee hasn't yet interviewed, including but not limited to former and current campaign and administration staffers like Reince Priebus, Stephen Miller, KT McFarland, Sean Spicer, Kellyanne Conway, and Sam Nunberg, as well as a number of other people, like Natalia Veselnitskaya, who came to Trump Tower to meet with Donald Trump Jr. in June 2016, and Simona Mangiante, who recently married former Trump adviser, and special counsel cooperator, George Papadopoulos.\n\nEntities and companies the Democrats want documents from, such as Deutsche Bank, which paid a $425 million dollar fine last year for its involvement in a money-laundering scheme with Russian clients, and a number of social media and tech companies, including Facebook, Twitter, Google, Snapchat, and Imgur, to continue the committee's probe into the depth of the Russian disinformation campaign.\n\nInstances in which the Democrats feel subpoenas are necessary to get the information they need: this section names more than 15 people, including Trump Jr., Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, outgoing communications director Hope Hicks, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whom Democrats want to use subpoenas for to either make them appear before the committee or provide more information or documents than they have previously.\n\nThe Republican leading the House investigation, Rep. Mike Conaway of Texas, appeared to back away from the committee's Monday position that it had found no evidence that the Russians tried to help Trump. As Conaway told reporters on Tuesday, \"Whether or not they were trying to hurt Hillary, help Trump ... it's kind of the glass half full, glass half empty.\"\n\nThe House Intelligence has hosted a number of high profile open and closed hearings since starting its investigation into Russian interference last year, but it became apparent things were turning partisan when the Republican chairman of the committee, Rep. Devin Nunes, of California, was forced to recuse himself from the investigation last April. Since then, Republicans and Democrats on the committee have essentially been working separate investigations; it's unclear when the Democrats plan to release their own full report.\n\nThe full \"status update\" from the Democratic members of the House intelligence committee is below.", "keywords": ["report", "response", "democrats", "committee", "investigation", "conclusions", "release", "russia", "republican", "intelligence", "trump", "gop", "russian", "house", "campaign"], "polarity": 0.06532173382173383, "subjectivity": 0.35978815628815636},

The family lives in Pacific Grove, a predominantly white, affluent area on California's Monterey Peninsula.\n\nEvery summer, Quarles' wife and children go to Germany to visit family. Consequently, Quarles spends the summers alone. And without his family around, he says, he's treated very differently.\n\nMost of the time, \"I've noticed my white counterparts almost avoid me. They seem afraid,\" Quarles tells NPR Special Correspondent Michele Norris. \"They don't know what to think of me because I'm in their neighborhood. I oftentimes wonder if they think I'm a thug.\"\n\n\"The same does not happen when I have the security blanket and shield of my children,\" Quarles says. \"When my children are with me, I'm just a dad. I love being a dad.\"\n\nThose experiences prompted him to share his six words with The Race Card Project: \"With kids, I'm Dad; Alone, thug.\"\n\n'Where Are You From?'\n\n\"There aren't a whole lot of African-American males in Pacific Grove,\" Quarles says. \"So I think most people do wonder, 'What is this ... black guy up to? ... Why is he here, and what is he doing? And why is he in my nice, affluent neighborhood?' \"\n\nThat \"stings and bites,\" says Quarles, an ultrasound technician. \"I have a very decent job. I would take care of most of these people if they came to my hospital. And to assume that I'm anything less than a productive member of the community, that does hurt.\"\n\n'I'm Just A Regular Old Hospital Worker'\n\nQuarles recalls an incident when his family first moved into their second home in Pacific Grove. \"We had been in the home for maybe two days,\" he says, when the police knocked on the door, looking for a missing purse.\n\nThe officer asked Quarles if he had noticed anything suspicious in the neighborhood. \"And I said, 'Like what?' And he said, 'Well, the woman across the street is missing her purse.'\n\n\"And I looked at him, and I said, 'So, you can come in and look for it if you'd like. But no, I didn't take the purse.' \"\n\nQuarles was surprised when his neighbor approached him a few days later. He walked over to tell Quarles that he was \"really sorry about the other day.\"\n\n\"And I said, 'What do you mean?' And he said, 'Well, the police went over to your house.' And I'm like, 'You sent the police to my house?' \"\n\nThe neighbor explained that he did ask the police to check them out, but his family eventually found the missing purse \u2014 in their own home. He then went on, Quarles recalls, to ask Quarles where he was from.\n\n\"And I said, 'I'm from here, Pacific Grove.' And he said, 'No, really \u2014 where did you move from before you moved here to this house?' \"\n\nWhen Quarles explained that his family had moved from their first home, nearby, \"he looked at me again and he said, 'You have two houses?' \" Quarles says the neighbor then looked at him from head to toe and asked, \"What do you do?\"\n\n\"And part of me \u2014 sometimes I mess with these people. I'll tell them, 'Well, I sell drugs and I'm a pimp. I can get you anything I want.' ... I say it deadpan serious.\"\n\nThey finally realize he's joking, Quarles says, when he starts laughing. \"And once they see the crazy hours that I work and they see me in my hospital scrubs, then they clearly know I'm not a pimp and a drug dealer,\" he says. \"I'm just a regular old hospital worker.\"\n\nLiving With A Double Standard\n\nQuarles' experiences weigh on his mind when he thinks about his children. His son, Joshua, has brown skin, while he described his daughter, Danielle, as \"very, very light. She could almost pass for white.\"\n\nQuarles knows the community and the world might treat his kids differently as they grow older, particularly with one child being lighter and the other darker-skinned. \"I think the world will have a certain idea of what they are, and what they can become, just by looking at them,\" he says.\n\nThat difference also comes into play with how his kids see themselves, Quarles says. Several years ago, he says, his daughter's teacher asked the class to write essays about what the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday meant to them.\n\nIn her essay, Quarles' daughter wrote \"that if it were not for Dr. Martin Luther King, she and her brother, Joshua, would have to go to different schools,\" Quarles says.\n\n\"She meant that she would go to one school, and that her brother, Joshua, because of his browner skin, would have to go to a school other than the school that she attended.\"\n\nQuarles and his wife wrestled with if, and how, the family should discuss the issue of skin color together.\n\nIn the end, he says, \"we decided to ... let her grow and potentially approach that conversation a little bit later. Because I think eventually, and unfortunately, someone who's a little lighter than she is with a little straighter hair, with a little blonder hair, is going to call her out and get her to understand that she does have some brown in her.\"\n\nEven so, Quarles says, \"I don't know if my wife and I are doing the right things by not talking about race that much with them.\"\n\nBut as their children get older, they're the ones who are bringing it up \u2014 like this summer, after a white police officer shot black 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.\n\nQuarles says his son \"brought it up many times, and continues to bring it up. Because he identifies with being more black than white, although he's split right down the middle. And things like that do concern him.\n\n\"As he's getting older, he's getting bigger and stronger and folks are starting to wonder about him,\" Quarles adds. \"You know, 'What is he? Why is he here?' \"\n\nQuarles responds by telling his son \"that there are simply things that he cannot do,\" he says. \"Just because of his appearance and his brown skin, there are things that he can't do that the other kids can do.\"\n\nAnd if that sounds like a double-standard, Quarles says, that's because it is. \"That's my answer: 'It is a double standard, Son. And trust me, one day, you'll understand.' \"\n\nNot that Quarles accepts double standards based on skin color. But he's had to figure out how to rise above them, he says \u2014 how to succeed by letting certain slights go. And that's the path to success for his son, too, he says.\n\n\"You can live in this world with that double standard and be successful and have a wonderful life.\"", "keywords": ["think", "quarles", "children", "skin", "family", "im", "hes", "kids", "son", "thug", "wife", "dad", "words"], "polarity": 0.05959308169982327, "subjectivity": 0.3900721968418598},

Kennedy's Speech After Martin Luther King's Assassination\n\nWhen Robert F. Kennedy learned of Martin Luther King's assassination in April of 1968, he gave an impromptu speech in Indiana. Decades later, it's credited with calming the devastated crowd.\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\n\nAlmost 50 years ago, April 4, 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. And his loss set off riots in dozens of U.S. cities, but not in Indianapolis. As Jill Sheridan of member station WFYI reports, that's in part because of a short impromptu speech made by a stumping presidential candidate who would himself be assassinated two months later.\n\nJILL SHERIDAN, BYLINE: In the spring of 1968, Robert F. Kennedy was late in entering the primary race for the Democratic presidential nomination. His campaign was gearing up in Indiana. On April 4, 16-year-old Teresa Lubbers tagged along with her older brother to a campaign rally. It was a cold, wet early spring evening. Lubbers says there were hundreds in the predominantly African-American crowd.\n\nTERESA LUBBERS: We were in the back, sort of - so I had a view of sort of the whole crowd.\n\nSHERIDAN: She was not alone in experiencing this shock from the news Kennedy delivered.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nROBERT F. KENNEDY: I have some very sad news for all of you, and that is that Martin Luther King was shot and was killed tonight.\n\n(SCREAMING)\n\nSHERIDAN: Abie Robinson was in the crowd that night, too. He was 24.\n\nABIE ROBINSON: The shift in my emotions swung from very angry when I heard the news about Martin Luther King's assassination to coming to the understanding of what Martin Luther King stood for.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nKENNEDY: Martin Luther King dedicated his life to love and to justice.\n\nSHERIDAN: City and state leaders had urged Kennedy to cancel his appearance, but he refused to. The words he delivered from the back of a flatbed truck didn't come from a speechwriter.\n\nROBINSON: He had it written on a little piece of paper that I'd seen him have folded up in his hand. He was able to connect and so that not only you heard the words that he said, you believe that he felt the words that he said.\n\nSHERIDAN: Reggie Jones was 27 and had brought a group of young men to hear Kennedy. He remembers fearing their reaction to the news.\n\nREGGIE JONES: So I took the guys back to School 63 on the South Side, and we played basketball from the time we got there, maybe about 10 - 10:30, to about 2 in the morning.\n\nSHERIDAN: Abie Robinson says there were others like Jones who worked to keep the peace that night.\n\nROBINSON: There were leaders from different parts of the city that were in touch with the people who would have been in that element that would be burning down your own neighborhood.\n\nSHERIDAN: There was unrest in more than 60 U.S. cities - what's now known as the Holy Week Uprising. But Indianapolis was relatively calm.\n\nRAY BOOMHOWER: I think words matter, and Kennedy's words mattered quite a bit that evening.\n\nSHERIDAN: Historian Ray Boomhower wrote a book about Kennedy's primary campaign.\n\nBOOMHOWER: He was wearing an overcoat that had belonged to his brother. And this was really the first time he had made any kind of public statement about his brother's death. You know, he said, you know...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nKENNEDY: I had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a white man.\n\nSHERIDAN: Boomhower says Kennedy appeared to draw from his own grief as he quoted a Greek poet.\n\nBOOMHOWER: And the words that he spoke, I think, had a particular impact to the crowd when he said, even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nKENNEDY: Falls drop by drop upon the heart until in our own despair, against our will comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.\n\nSHERIDAN: Those words were spoken right here in this Indianapolis park now named for King. A large memorial sculpture has two statues - Kennedy on one side of a path and King on the other, hands stretched out towards each other. Reggie Jones finds that comforting.\n\nJONES: Still reaching out - that's the hope. In spite of everything that you see, there's still hope.\n\nSHERIDAN: For NPR News, I'm Jill Sheridan.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

The city has experienced nearly two weeks of continuous unrest after the shooting of the 22-year-old Clark, an unarmed black man, by two police officers.\n\nDozens were unable to get in and waited outside during the services.\n\nSacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg attended the services. Rev. Al Sharpton spoke as did the family.\n\nStephon Clark's brother Ste'vante Clark shook hands with family and friends and gave them kisses. He also danced on the stage, hugged his brother's coffin and, during a speech by regional NAACP chapter President Alice Huffman, took over the microphone to deliver his own emotional talk.\n\n\"We're going to do coliseums for Stephon, we're going to do libraries, we're going to do resource centers,\" he said. \"Stephon is going to live for generations to generations to generations to generations.\"\n\nSharpton defended Ste'vante Clark's behavior. \"You don't tell people when you kill their loved one how to grieve,\" he told the audience. \"We did not come for you uppity, bourgeois, proper folk. We came for Ste'vante, we came for the family, we came because this boy should be alive today.\"\n\nSte'vante Clark also called on the crowd to care for Stephon Clark's two children and their mother.\n\nSharpton embraced Ste'vante and promising to help his efforts to remember his brother.\n\n\"Stephon Clark has brought us back,\" Sharpton said at the close of the funeral. \"We're going to make Donald Trump and the whole world deal with the issue of police misconduct.\"\n\n\"This is not a Sacramento fight any more, this is a national fight. Stephon has woke up the nation.\"\n\nSharpton also spoke to reporters before the funeral. \"This is not local issue, but national issue. The life of this young man is not expendable. We cannot continue to have unarmed men be shot,\" he said in front of the church.\n\nHe added that the police officers, who turned off the audio on their body cameras minutes after the shooting, \"hit the mute button like President Trump has been mute\" on this issue.\n\nTwice in the past week, demonstrators have blocked thousands of fans from entering Sacramento Kings basketball games.

But when you've been president everything in the past is ripe for perusal by historians, researchers and journalists.\n\nAnd so it is with the love letters of former President Barack Obama \u2014 excerpts of which have been released by Emory University's Stuart A. Rose Manuscript, Archives and Rare Book Library, where the letters a young Obama wrote to then-girlfriend Alexandra McNear are now part of the collection.\n\nThe letters were written between September 1982 and April 1984, after Obama had transferred from Occidental College in Los Angeles to Columbia University in New York City. McNear remained in California.\n\nThe first letter in the collection, which the university says Obama wrote at a campus cafe, \"drinking V8 juice and listening to a badly scratched opera being broadcast,\" as he put it, finds Obama articulating what would become familiar themes in his later writing, feelings of not belonging and alienation (themes that many 21-year-olds might find familiar).\n\nIn September 1982, he writes of a college friend who will soon marry and a high school friend who manages a supermarket.\n\n\"I must admit large dollops of envy for both groups, my American friends consuming their life in the comfortable mainstream, the foreign friends in the international business world,\" Obama wrote McNear. \"Caught without a class, a structure, or a tradition to support me, in a sense the choice to take a different path is made for me.\n\n\"The only way to assuage my feelings of isolation are to absorb all the traditions, classes, make them mine, me theirs. Taken separately, they're unacceptable and untenable.\"\n\nHe ends the letter, which was written on yellow-lined note paper, \"I trust you know that I miss you, that my concern for you is as wide as the air, my confidence in you as deep as the sea, my love rich and plentiful, Love, Barack.\"\n\nIn a November 1982 letter, Obama writes of the enjoyment he takes in his relationship with McNear, and the challenge of \"forging a unity, mixing it up, constructing the truth to be found between the seams of individual lives. All of which requires breaking some sweat. Like a good basketball game. Or a fine dance. Or making love.\n\n\"We will talk long and deep, Alex, and see what we can make of this.\"\n\nIn June 1983, Obama writes McNear during a trip he took back to Indonesia, where he lived as a child and where his mother and sister remain.\n\n\"I can't speak the language well anymore. I'm treated with a mixture of puzzlement, deference and scorn because I'm American, my money and my plane ticket back to the U.S. overriding my blackness. I see old dim roads, rickety homes winding back towards the fields, old routes of mine, routes I no longer have access to.\"\n\nHe also expresses to McNear some uncertainty about the future of their relationship. \"I think of you often, though I stay confused about my feelings,\" Obama writes. \"It seems we will ever want what we cannot have; that's what binds us; that's what keeps us apart.\"\n\nLater that year, Obama and McNear are no longer lovers, but remain friends. He writes her of his struggles finding a job in New York, and of his tight finances. \"Salaries in the community organizations are too low to survive on right now, so I hope to work in some more conventional capacity for a year, allowing me to store up enough nuts to pursue those interests next,\" he says.\n\n\"One week I can't pay postage to mail a resume and writing sample,\" he writes, \"the next I have to bounce a check to rent a typewriter.\"\n\nBy 1984, Obama has found a job at Business International where he says, \"[c]uriously enough, I've emerged as one of the 'promising young men' of Business International, with everyone slapping my back and praising my work.\"\n\nHe writes he has \"cultivated strong bonds with the black women and their children in the company, who work as librarians, receptionists, etc.,\" while \"the only black men are teen messengers.\"\n\nHe concludes:\n\n\"The resistance I wage does wear me down \u2014 because of the position, the best I can hope for is a draw, since I have no vehicle or forum to try to change things. For this reason, I can't stay very much longer than a year. Thankfully, I don't yet feel like the job has dulled my senses or done irreparable damage to my values, although it has stalled their growth.\"\n\nEmory says facsimiles of Obama's letters will be on view Friday.

Ben Cardin Weighs In On Tensions Between U.S. And Russia\n\nNPR's Ailsa Chang talks with Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, about the tensions between Russia and the U.S after a tit-for-tat expulsion of diplomats from their countries.\n\nAILSA CHANG, HOST:\n\nIn a week that has been marked by tit for tat moves between Russia and the West, Russia is expelling another batch of diplomats. Today it announced it will be ordering diplomats from more than 20 countries to leave. This is on top of the 60 U.S. diplomats Russia sent home yesterday. This wave of expulsions by Russia was highly anticipated after the U.S. and more than 20 other countries declared this week they would be kicking out Russian diplomats in solidarity with Britain over the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter.\n\nDemocrat Ben Cardin of Maryland sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. And he joins us now to talk about next steps in this diplomatic standoff. Thanks for being with us, Senator.\n\nBEN CARDIN: It's good to be with you. Thank you.\n\nCHANG: I've been curious. What does expelling diplomats actually accomplish other than serving as a show of force?\n\nCARDIN: Well, several of these diplomats, they may have a diplomatic shield, but they're basically gathering intelligence for the Russian government to be used against the United States. So the fewer diplomats, the less information Russia can get in order to carry out a lot of its nefarious actions.\n\nCHANG: And those costs are being suffered on all sides now as everybody's losing diplomats in different countries.\n\nCARDIN: That's correct. But I would challenge the fact that Russia has been the most aggressive country in doing things that violate international norms. So it's important that we let them know they can't do this.\n\nCHANG: You know, just today the Russian military said it successfully tested its latest intercontinental ballistic missile. How concerned are you that this diplomatic tit for tat will just keep intensifying?\n\nCARDIN: Well, we want to see Russia change its behavior. Yes, if they sent the missile into the United States or they used their military against us, I think everyone fully understand that we could not let that go unchallenged. But Russia did that in our elections. And we can't let that go unchallenged. There's got to be consequences.\n\nCHANG: So are you saying that the U.S. has an interest in escalating the tit for tat to reciprocate in like kind each time?\n\nCARDIN: We don't want to escalate. But it will only escalate if Mr. Putin will continue to do these activities and accelerate them if we do not make clear there's a price that he'll pay for doing it. So by taking these actions against Russia, we have a much better chance of changing the escalation of the actions against our own country.\n\nCHANG: Does the current tension between Russia and Western countries feel at all reminiscent to you of what we experienced during the Cold War?\n\nCARDIN: Of course these are different times, and the stakes are much higher than they were during the Cold War. So it is certainly a challenge. But, yes, I think we see some of the trends that we saw during the Cold War being continued now. But understand we are the ones being attacked. We haven't provoked Russia. They did this to us. And therefore we've got to defend our democratic institutions because Mr. Putin is not going to be satisfied until he takes over other countries. We see that in Ukraine. We see that in Moldova. We see that in Georgia. We don't want to see another country be dominated by the Soviet Union.\n\nCHANG: Do you feel that the White House is in lockstep with you and your feelings towards Vladimir Putin?\n\nCARDIN: No, I don't. I think - it's not my views. I think the congressional views of Russia are different than Mr. Trump's views on Russia. Mr. Trump has yet to acknowledge that Mr. Putin was directly engaged in our elections in 2016. His administration has, but the president has not. We saw just recently the president call and congratulate Mr. Putin on his election even though it wasn't a free and fair election. So it's clear to me that Mr. Trump's view of Mr. Putin is not in step with what the Congress believes, that Mr. Putin is a great risk to the United States.\n\nCHANG: All right, that's Democratic Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland. Thank you very much for joining us.\n\nCARDIN: Good to talk to you, thanks.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

With tax reform moving quickly through Congress, confidence in the strength of our economy remains high and families around the country are reaping the benefits. We're especially pleased to see the manufacturing sector roaring back to life, adding a total of 159,000 jobs since President Trump took office after averaging a loss of more than 1,000 jobs per month during the last year of the previous administration. As we continue to unleash the American economy from unnecessary regulation and taxes, we look forward to seeing more reports like this, showing a healthy and thriving jobs market for the American people.\"\n\n\u2014 White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders\n\nThe Labor Department reports that U.S. employers added 228,000 jobs in November, somewhat better than analysts had been expecting. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.1 percent. Job gains in manufacturing were especially strong with 31,000 added last month.\n\nThe president boasted about it on Twitter.\n\nIt's difficult to tie those gains directly to President Trump's economic vision, however. On average, employers have added 170,000 jobs in each of the 10 months since Trump took office. That's slightly below the 196,000 per month pace during the comparable period in 2016, under President Obama. If you throw out September of this year, when job gains were depressed by hurricanes, Trump's monthly average is closer to Obama's, at 185,000, but the change in administrations doesn't appear to have had much effect on the overall job market.\n\nThe job gains in November were widespread across industries and demographic groups.\n\n\"We're at that point in the cycle where the market is tight enough that it's really rewarding everybody,\" said Kevin Hassett, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nHe noted that unemployment among workers without a high school diploma fell by half a percentage point to 5.2 percent. And the jobless rate among Hispanics dipped to 4.7 percent, the lowest level on record.\n\n\"If we could sustain growth at this level for another couple of years then the amount of progress we could make on income inequality and wage growth for middle America would be maybe even unprecedented,\" Hassett said.\n\nDespite the tight labor market, though, wages have risen only modestly in the past year.\n\n\"Wage growth was not as strong as we'd like to see it,\" Hassett acknowledged. \"We fully expect that that's going to accelerate next year if the tax bill passes.\"\n\nTom Maher, who runs a Manpower temporary franchise in Dayton, Ohio, agreed that paychecks need to get bigger.\n\n\"Wages are rising, but they're not rising as fast as I believe they really should in order to attract the workers that they need,\" Maher said. \"Virtually every manufacturer in the area has a help-wanted sign outside their window.\"\n\nFactories nationwide have added 171,000 jobs so far in 2017 \u2014 a rebound from the previous year when factories shed 16,000 jobs. Trump has promised to lead a renaissance in American manufacturing. The sector has generally been adding jobs since 2010, although the strength of export-oriented factories is strongly tied to what's happening in the global economy.\n\nWith the unemployment rate hovering at its lowest level since 2000, a shortage of skilled workers could be a drag on future economic growth.\n\n\"There is some slack in the labor market,\" said Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG. \"But there's a big question about whether that remaining slack in the labor market can be deployed.\"\n\n\"What I expect is we will start to see increasing labor shortages as we go into 2018. And at some point \u2014 and it may be late 2018, it may be mid 2019 \u2014 those labor shortages are going to really limit the ability we have to continue expanding.\"\n\nAt a White House Cabinet meeting this week, Trump said he wants to draw more people into the workforce.\n\n\"We're also getting into the pool of the 100 million people that are not working,\" Trump said. \"That pool is now coming back.\"\n\nAccording to the Labor Department, there are 95 million Americans 16 and older who are not working. But that figure includes retirees, students and voluntary stay-at-home parents. It's an open question how many might be lured into the workforce. Lower taxes might offer a carrot to would-be workers. The administration is also considering sticks \u2014 in the form of a less generous safety net.\n\n\"I know people, they work three jobs and they live next to somebody who doesn't work at all,\" the president told supporters in Missouri last week. \"And the person who is not working at all and has no intention of working at all is making more money and doing better than the person that's working his or her ass off. And it's not going to happen. Not going to happen.\"\n\nThis week the Agriculture Department announced a push to limit the food stamp program \u2014 known as SNAP \u2014 in an effort to push more people into the workforce.\n\n\"SNAP was created to provide people with the help they need to feed themselves and their families, but it was not intended to be a permanent lifestyle,\" Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement. \"We want to provide the nutrition people need, but we also want to help them transition from government programs back to work and into lives of independence.\"\n\nThe White House had telegraphed this move in May when the president unveiled a budget calling for cuts in food stamp spending.\n\n\"We need folks to work,\" White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said at the time. \"We don't have enough money to take care of the people \u2014 everybody \u2014 who doesn't need help.\"\n\nAs of August, there were more than 41 million Americans receiving food stamps. Advocates for the program note that the government already requires able-bodied adults without children to find work within three months to collect benefits.\n\nTrump also boasted this week about the rising stock market.\n\n\"We have a stock market that has hit record highs 81 times since our election victory,\" he told Cabinet members. \"It's at a new high right now.\"\n\nThe S&P 500-stock index has risen more than 23 percent since Election Day last year. Along with a rising real estate market, that's helped to push the nation's total household wealth to $96.9 trillion. However, as NPR noted last spring, only about half the people in the country own stocks either directly or through retirement accounts.\n\n\"You could argue that there's a trickle-down effect,\" said KPMG's Hunter, \"but actual evidence of that meaningfully changing people's lives over the long term seems to be de minimis.\"", "keywords": ["check", "fact", "record", "white", "trumps", "stocks", "president", "labor", "need", "jobs", "work", "trump", "working", "market", "workers"], "polarity": 0.13331213924963922, "subjectivity": 0.37007835046897536},

The new court-drawn map is expected to upend that tilt.\n\nJustices described their map in their 48-page decision as \"superior\" to other proposals filed for their consideration.\n\nTop statehouse Republicans have pledged to challenge the judicially enacted map, which they say amounts to overreach by the Democratic-majority court.\n\nThe court's decision comes after a monthlong standoff. When justices first declared the previous map unconstitutional on Jan. 22, they ordered the GOP-controlled Legislature and Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, to negotiate a compromise.\n\nThe justices said they wanted the new map to be fairer, specifying that districts should be more compact and contiguous and should split fewer municipalities.\n\nA compromise map never happened.\n\nAnalysis Ask Cokie: Is Gerrymandering Rigging America's Political System?

Mike Stack submitted maps completely independently.\n\nThat's in addition to one sent in by a group of Republican activists who intervened in the case and two sent in by the case's Democratic petitioners along with the League of Women Voters. All parties to the case were technically allowed to file maps.\n\nThe submitted maps varied significantly in terms of partisan advantage, though overall they all made districts more compact, and to varying degrees they divided fewer municipalities.\n\nThe various parties to the case approached the redistricting process differently. House and Senate Republicans worked largely with existing staff members who have previous Pennsylvania mapping experience. They said they didn't take partisanship into consideration at all, and they ended up with a map with a relatively similar GOP advantage to the current one.\n\nOn the other hand, Wolf, the governor, hired Tufts University professor Moon Duchin to consult on his map. Her analysis, the governor said, found that the map has \"no partisan skew in comparison to over a billion randomly generated maps.\"\n\nThe justices were advised by Nathan Persily, a Stanford law professor with a background in drawing political district maps. He has previously assisted judges in New York, Connecticut, North Carolina, Georgia and Maryland in redistricting cases.\n\n\"We're going to have a Stanford professor come into Pennsylvania, and he's going to act as the prosecutor by presenting the evidence, he's going to act as the juror by evaluating the evidence, and he solely is going to act as a judge by ultimately ruling on the evidence and producing a map \u2014 one person \u2014 to the court for the people of Pennsylvania to live under,\" state Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman said in advance of Monday's announcement.\n\nRepublicans also are calling the process foul.

The map that they ultimately submitted was from the Legislature's two GOP leaders.\n\nStatehouse Republicans say the court is usurping the power of the legislative and executive branches, a situation that essentially creates a \"constitutional crisis.\"", "keywords": ["pennsylvania", "wolf", "map", "going", "democrats", "professor", "senate", "voting", "court", "submitted", "shift", "advantage", "courtdrawn", "republicans"], "polarity": 0.07664502164502165, "subjectivity": 0.40857413419913413},

He claims upwards of 18,000 non-citizens could be on Kansas' voter rolls.\n\nHe has the names of more than 40 suspected non-citizens who registered to vote and is relying on statistical extrapolations to make his case that they are \"the tip of the iceberg.\"\n\nRick Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California, Irvine, thinks some Republican states could follow Kansas' footsteps if the court finds in Kobach's favor.\n\nHasen calls that \"red state election law,\" and says it's based on the theory that making it harder to register ultimately benefits Republicans at the polls. Democrats, meanwhile, see political benefits in easing access to the vote.\n\n\"States with Republican legislatures and governors have been passing laws that make it harder to register and vote,\" Hasen said. \"States with Democratic governors and legislatures have been passing laws that make it easier.\"\n\nThis story comes from the Kansas News Service, a collaboration covering health, education and politics across the state.", "keywords": ["state", "fraud", "kansas", "investigator", "law", "noncitizens", "voter", "states", "trial", "trump", "federal", "vote", "rules", "kobach"], "polarity": 0.021180555555555564, "subjectivity": 0.36423611111111104},

But in the time he has spent writing about Civil War re-enactors, he has met many who say they do.\n\nTheir perspectives on the Confederate flag and the legacy of their ancestors prompted Dukes, a writer and radio reporter, to share his own six words with the Race Card Project: \"Must We Forget Our Confederate Ancestors?\"\n\nDukes, a Southerner himself, embedded last year with a group of Civil War re-enactors at the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg, and wrote about it in a piece for the Virginia Quarterly Review.\n\n\"I just wanted to see the spectacle of the thing,\" he tells NPR Special Correspondent Michele Norris. The event, a re-enactment of one of the Civil War's most famous battles, \"was going to be like the Woodstock of re-enacting, is what everyone told me. ... I wanted to sort of understand what they got out of it.\"\n\nPart of his motivation, Dukes says, was to connect with re-enactors \"in an environment where I thought people would be comfortable talking about things like the legacy of slavery, and the legacy of Jim Crow and the legacy of racism.\"\n\nAs it turned out, the people he met weren't particularly comfortable talking about those themes, Dukes says. But they did talk when prompted, and \"everybody was kind and everybody was very welcoming,\" he notes.\n\nMany Confederate re-enactors understand, Dukes says, that the Confederate flag is associated with segregation, the KKK and lynchings. \"And invariably people would say, you know, racism was so terrible. It was an abomination. ... But that's not what I'm here to connect with,' \" Dukes says.\n\n'A History, Not A Hate, Issue'\n\nInstead, the re-enactors were there to connect with their ancestors, he says. \"Maybe not run up that exact same hill, but a simulacrum of that hill with the same sounds and the same shouts and the same visual stimulus \u2014 minus the blood and dying. And it still seemed to define their identity.\"\n\n\"I think people tried to distance their ancestors from the guilt associated with slavery, and I also think they tried to implicate everybody else,\" Dukes says. \"So, pointing out, very accurately, that slavery \u2014 the economic system \u2014 relied on the markets and the textile factories and places like that in the North.\"\n\nWhile reporting, Dukes met Sara Smith, a Confederate re-enactor from Dayton, Va. Her great-great-grandfather, Harry N. Smith, fought for the Confederacy at Gettysburg and was wounded in battle.\n\nSara Smith has Confederate flag stickers on the back of her truck \u2014 and says those who see it as a symbol glorifying racism or segregation don't understand the meaning the flag holds for her.\n\n\"I think people need to realize ... it's a history, not a hate, issue,\" Smith told Dukes. \"I think too many people get caught up in the symbol. You know, for us, it doesn't mean the same thing it means to other people. The flag that they get so upset over, was actually not a flag. It was a battle flag. It was what you formed off of to know you were on the right side\" in battle.\n\nSmith doesn't think her great-great-grandfather was fighting to preserve slavery. To her, it's \"the flag her great-great-grandfather carried up that hill in a desperate attempt to maintain his state's freedom from government interference,\" Dukes says.\n\nAnd \"if her great-great-grandfather was a good, noble, brave person who was wounded and then came home, and still lived to be something like 80, and showed so much bravery on the field, and he could carry that flag, why would it be wrong for her to put it on her vehicle?\"\n\n'Willful Innocence'\n\nDukes describes that perspective as \"willful innocence.\" It's a logic \"that says, 'OK, I have the right to love my great-great-grandfather and to admire those things in his life that are admirable, like bravery, like loyalty, like accomplishments, like survival. And because he must have been a good person, then the cause he fought for and the flag that he held must not have been a bad cause.' \"\n\nDukes says that perspective led some of the re-enactors to make the following assertion: \"People who are offended by [the flag] just don't understand what the Confederate flag really means.\"\n\nThe Confederate flag holds different significance for other Americans, as well, Dukes says. While some Southerners are well aware that the flag is often perceived as racist \u2014 and display it anyway \u2014 others display it to demonstrate their mistrust in federal government and as a symbol of resistance to federal regulation.\n\nAnd for others, Dukes says, the Confederate flag signifies an awareness that rural white Southerners, and rural Americans more generally, are often stereotyped as backward.\n\n\"I think the flag has transcended Southern identity to become [linked to] a kind of rural impoverished identity, too,\" says Dukes, who says he has even seen people display the Confederate flag in rural Maine.\n\n\"I think there are poor people in the rural South and North and all over the country who do feel like they're stereotyped and they don't have everything ... including respect ... that's due to them.\n\n\"I'm not sure that waving a Confederate flag is a great way to get that respect back \u2014 and often it is enacting the stereotype that they're trying to escape \u2014 but I do think it's a legitimate complaint nevertheless.\"\n\nDukes says he enjoyed meeting re-enactors like Smith, and doesn't \"begrudge them their weekends clad in gray, remembering their ancestors, hoisting libations and waving the battle flag,\" he writes in Virginia Quarterly Review.\n\nBut, Dukes writes, \"better to roll the flag up at the end of the weekend and leave it in the trunk until the next re-enactment. This is the 21st century, and the Confederate flag has no place in our time.\"", "keywords": ["think", "ancestors", "understand", "dukes", "rural", "confederate", "flag", "smith", "forget", "greatgreatgrandfather", "words", "reenactors"], "polarity": 0.14372959183673473, "subjectivity": 0.4410844671201814},

But one group in particular has had a major increase well before that - the National African American Gun Association. Their numbers tripled after the inauguration of President Donald Trump. Philip Smith founded the group in 2015. And he joins us from Atlanta. Mr. Smith, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nPHILIP SMITH: Thanks for having me today.\n\nSIMON: And why did you create this National African American Gun Association rather than just join the NRA?\n\nSMITH: I wanted a voice for our community where we could feel comfortable to gather, a place where we could come and learn about firearms together in a very peaceful and nonthreatening environment.\n\nSIMON: You're a gun owner.\n\nSMITH: Yes, I am.\n\nSIMON: May I ask what kind of guns you own?\n\nSMITH: I have a AK-47. I have a Glock 19. I have a Glock 17. And I have the - as of late, I've got a hunting 783 Remington.\n\nSIMON: Why an AK-47?\n\nSMITH: It's a good gun. It serves a purpose. It's really good for self-defense purposes. And I think it's a very solid tool to have.\n\nSIMON: What's your analysis, Mr. Smith - maybe from conversations with some of your membership - as to why you had this terrific increase in membership right after President Trump's inauguration?\n\nSMITH: Well, I think it's a three-headed monster. I think, one, people are looking at, you know, the state of the United States in terms of robberies, burglaries, things that are happening on your daily basis. Two, I think also - probably just as important - we see what's happening around the world. You know, terrorism is something that scares black folks just like anybody else. So we are aware of that. But also, we look at what's happening in the political arena in terms of the conversations and the types of conversations. We see folks that were on the fringes of society, let's say, eight, nine, 10 years ago. But they're now out front talking about various things that are somewhat disturbing.\n\nSIMON: When you say people on the fringes of society, let me chance to be blunt. Do you mean white racists?\n\nSMITH: I think there are some individuals out there that have negative views of African-Americans. They have gotten bolder and bolder in their conversations in terms of our place in society. We're getting too progressive. Or we're moving too much up the ladder in society, so they want to kind of keep us down. When we hear those things - and me being a black man - your alarms go off. And you say, you know what? I think the days of us sitting back and just turning the other cheek - I think those days are long gone.\n\nSIMON: Mr. Smith, how do you and the African American Gun Association feel about stricter gun laws?\n\nSMITH: From the organizational standpoint, we believe that if you're a violent person and you beat your wife, you never need to own a gun. If you have a violent felony, you never need to have a gun. And a third piece - if you on - are the no-fly list, you need to not have a gun for any shape, form or reason.\n\nSIMON: And what about the argument - I'm sure you've heard - that putting more guns in the hands of more people just adds fuel to a fire that's burning up parts of America?\n\nSMITH: Well, see. I disagree with that argument. And I do hear that particular perspective, and I respect it. I believe that the best way to stop someone with a gun other than law enforcement is to have a gun yourself. I think too often as African-Americans we've been told to not arm ourselves. And I think too often we are just sitting back and letting someone come and save us. If you look at our communities right now across the country, they are in a wreck because we cannot protect those communities. These communities are just literally wide-open markets for violence, and that needs to change.\n\nSIMON: What do you say, Mr. Smith, to those people who might point out that, actually, urban crime has been going down in the United States for a generation?\n\nSMITH: I would say this. If you look at urban areas such as LA or east LA or South Chicago - and there's a lot of gun violence in those areas. Let's be blunt. The reason those areas are having issues are the following - anytime you take a group of young men - black, white or any color - put them in an area in which they have a confrontational relationship with the police and, on top of that, give them no economic skills that can be transferable into 2018, and I'll tell you what's going to happen. All those gentlemen and ladies are going to be very, very frustrated. And they're going to do what they have to do to survive. If that means killing folks and shooting folks, unfortunately, that's what's going to happen. That's what's driving gun violence in certain areas throughout the U.S. It's not because it's the gun. It's that these folks, that these brothers don't have any recourse for anything viable that's going to allow them to have a skill to provide for themselves and their family.\n\nSIMON: Philip Smith is president and founder of the National African American Gun Association. Thanks so much for being with us, sir.\n\nSMITH: Thanks for having me.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

It's a tribute to Edward Colston, described on a small plaque as \"one of the most virtuous and wise sons\" of this city.\n\nAround town, there are numerous reminders of Colston, Bristol's most famous philanthropist: Streets, schools, a concert hall and an office tower are all named after him. A big stained glass window in Bristol Cathedral is dedicated to him. Even a local delicacy bears his name \u2014 the Colston bun, a sort of fruit strudel.\n\nBut there's also a dark side to Colston, one that's been long known but less prominently acknowledged: He made his fortune trading African slaves.\n\n\"I remember finding out how he made his money. That turned my world upside down,\" says Katie Finnegan-Clarke, 30, who attended Colston's Girls' School, a prestigious private school. When she was 14, one of her parents' friends told her about Colston's role in the slave trade.\n\n\"Having partaken so actively in so many school assemblies to celebrate him, it just made me feel sick,\" she says. \"It disturbs me.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Lauren Frayer/NPR Lauren Frayer/NPR\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, Bristol's port sent thousands of ships to trade African slaves for tobacco, sugar and rum in the New World. Colston was a member and later head of the Royal African Company, which held a slave-trading monopoly in Britain. He also traded sugar and other commodities harvested or produced by slaves in the British West Indies. He bequeathed his wealth to charities in his hometown, founding homeless shelters known as almshouses and many schools.\n\nNow, in the era of Black Lives Matter, and just as Confederate statues are taken down in some parts of the American South, Bristol is rethinking how it commemorates its biggest benefactor.\n\nTrustees of the city's premier music venue, Colston Hall, announced last year that when the facility reopens in 2020 after renovations, it will do so under a new name, as yet unannounced.\n\n\"We just couldn't reopen a building with some public money in it that was under the banner of a slave trader,\" says spokeswoman Sarah Robertson. \"There are sections of Bristol society who feel shame and embarrassment stepping into our building because of our name.\"\n\nFor years, the rock band Massive Attack, whose members come from Bristol, has refused to play at Colston Hall because of its name. That boycott grew two years ago with the creation of Countering Colston, a group of artists and activists lobbying for the removal of Colston's name from Bristol's institutions. The group was founded by Finnegan-Clarke and some of her former classmates.\n\nWhile many activists have praised plans for the name change, there has also been criticism.\n\nThe BBC reported last year that opponents of the name change made comments on Facebook calling it \"political correctness gone mad\" and saying the \"past should not be airbrushed out.\"\n\n\"We were accused of erasing history by changing the name,\" Robertson says. \"People thought we were dredging up a past that people would rather not remember. They want to forget about Bristol's slave-trading past.\"\n\nCurators at a Bristol museum, the M Shed, want to make sure that doesn't happen. The museum is located on a wharf in Bristol's harbor, where slave ships used to dock. Inside, there's a video of a spoken-word performance about racial stereotypes by Bristol's first poet laureate, Miles Chambers, who is black. There is also a huge map of the city from 1769, showing all the landmarks built with the profits of slavery.\n\n\"The idea is just to know that an awful lot of Bristol is built on the slave trade. From big houses, to the Bristol Old Vic \u2014 the oldest working theater in the country,\" explains curator Sue Giles.\n\nGiles does not agree with the Countering Colston activists, who want Colston's name erased from the city. It's better to remember, she believes.\n\n\"If you keep changing everything, people forget,\" she says. \"You don't know who Colston was, so there's no discussion of his role in the slave trade, about Bristol's role in the slave trade.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Lauren Frayer /NPR Lauren Frayer /NPR\n\nBut for many black Bristolians \u2014 who are a small but growing part of the city's population \u2014 having to see Colston's name on streets and buildings across their city is painful. Most black people in Britain are of Afro-Caribbean descent. Some of their ancestors were African slaves brought to Jamaica and other British territories before Parliament outlawed slavery in 1833.\n\n\"We're not at that position yet where there's enough empathy with the journey that people who were enslaved have been through,\" says Cleo Lake, 38, an artist and activist whose father is from Jamaica. \"I'm very angry at the fact that my taxes have gone towards lining the pockets of elite people, who still hold a lot of that wealth. I definitely believe in reparations.\"\n\nOnly in 2015 did Bristol taxpayers finish paying off the equivalent of $428 billion (in today's dollars) in loans the city took out in 1833 to compensate slave merchants for the loss of their trade, after slavery was outlawed.\n\nLake attended Colston's Girls' School and helped found the Countering Colston group. Her next target is the giant Colston statue towering over a city square, off Colston Avenue. She wants it removed.\n\nBristol \"has given the statue of Colston a pride of place, and this doesn't sit right with me anymore,\" she says.\n\nThe city recently announced plans to install a new plaque on the statue, to explain Colston's links to the slave trade. But it says the statue will remain where it is.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Lauren Frayer/NPR Lauren Frayer/NPR\n\nAfter Colston Hall announced its plans for a name change, Colston's Primary School followed suit, saying it will change its name ahead of the start of the next school year in September.\n\nBut Colston's Girls School has refused to change its name.\n\nBristol's Old Vic Theater, founded 250 years ago by local slave merchants, has launched a \"year of change\" in its programming, to ensure black playwrights are represented in its repertoire, says chief executive Emma Stenning.\n\nShe sees a link between what's happening in Bristol and the United States.\n\n\"You see many cities and many communities asking themselves, 'What are the things we choose to commemorate? What's missing from the history that we are telling?'\" Stenning says. \"That is definitely in the air.\"\n\nIn St. Paul's, a traditionally Afro-Caribbean neighborhood, artist Michele Curtis is taking matters into her own hands. She's been painting murals on city walls to honor the black citizens of Bristol. She'd like to see the city rename some of its landmarks.\n\n\"All the streets are named after slave merchants. But you don't really see that for black people that have contributed,\" Curtis says. \"Of course, it's just the name of a building. It's not really that important.

She noted that many, while supportive, expressed concerns about retaliations by their bosses if they spoke out. She noted that of the women who originally signed the letter, only five are staffers at the state Capitol.\n\n\"It's a power dynamic that's difficult even for female lawmakers,\" Corbin said. \"Even for women in the Legislature, men often control fundraising, your ability to get bills passed \u2014 even women at the highest levels feel that they're not insulated\" from retaliation.\n\nShe stressed that many men at the state Capitol have reached out to ask what they can do to help. But Corbin noted, some men are oblivious to sexual harassment, even when it happens right in front of them.\n\n\"They don't know what it looks like or how to intervene,\" Corbin said. \"Some of them don't even see what's happening with their own colleagues.\"\n\nThe women leaders write that \"millions of Americans were shocked\" to learn of Weinstein's behavior.\n\n\"We were not. This same kind of inappropriate, sexually harassing behavior cuts across every industry and facet of our society. No matter a woman's age, weight, religion, sexual orientation, race, social status, or position of power, she is not insulated from this behavior. It is pervasive,\" they wrote.\n\nThe letter goes on to detail the ways in which all of the letters' signatories have endured or witnessed \"some form of dehumanizing behavior by men with power in our workplaces.\"\n\nTheir list is long and explicit: Groping. Touching. Inappropriate comments about bodies and abilities. Insults and sexual innuendo, frequently disguised as jokes. Promises and threats.\n\n\"They have leveraged their power and positions to treat us however they would like,\" the group wrote, noting that they didn't speak up before out of fear, out of shame.\n\n\"Often these men hold our professional fates in their hands. They are bosses, gatekeepers, and contacts. Our relationships with them are crucial to our personal success,\" they wrote. \"We don't want to jeopardize our future, make waves, or be labeled 'crazy,' 'troublemaker,' or 'asking for it.' Worse, we're afraid when we speak up that no one will believe us, or we will be blacklisted.\"\n\nThe signatories include Democrats and Republicans; dozens of lawmakers and other elected officials; lobbyists, political consultants; party leaders. In short, pretty much every sector of California's political world.\n\nThey are asking other women to come forward, and have launched a website to collect stories and support one another. And they are demanding that men support them.\n\n\"We're done with this,\" the letter states. \"Each of us who signed this op-ed will no longer tolerate the perpetrators or enablers who do. What now? It's time for women to speak up and share their stories. We also need the good men, and there are many, to believe us, have our backs, and speak up. Until more women hold positions of power, our future is literally dependent on men. It's time.\"\n\nCorbin noted that while some legislators are notorious for their behavior toward women, organizers decided against naming names.\n\n\"Even if we had a list of the five worst offenders, it wouldn't do anything,\" she said. \"There's more than five.

David Brooks of the New York Times and E.J. Dionne of the Washington Post and the Brookings Institution join NPR's Ari Shapiro to discuss the week in politics.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nNow from domestic to foreign affairs - this week, North Korea's president made a trip to China. Russia expelled U.S. diplomats. And to talk about these stories and more from the week in politics, our Friday regulars are here in the studio, David Brooks of The New York Times and E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and the Brookings Institution. Hi, guys.\n\nDAVID BROOKS, BYLINE: Good to be here.\n\nE J DIONNE, BYLINE: Great to be with you.\n\nSHAPIRO: Let's start with the Russian expulsions. More than two dozen countries including the U.S. kicked out Russian diplomats in retaliation for the nerve agent attack on a Russian ex-spy and his daughter. Russia's retaliating by expelling Western diplomats, including 60 from the U.S., closing the U.S. consulate in St. Petersburg. Some Russia watchers are calling this the worst moment for Russia's relations with the West since the Cold War. E.J., do you think they're right?\n\nDIONNE: Yes. And it's a truly strange moment. Here you have Trump under legitimate attack for being so eager to praise Putin. He won't say a cross word about him. He has promised better relations with Russia. And we probably have worse relations with Russia than we ever have. And, you know, some could ask to use the old Reaganite slogan, peace through strength. Perhaps Trump's approach to Putin doesn't help us.\n\nBut there's a second level here, which is, Trump does not want the White House to announce all of the tough things the United States government is actually doing against Russia. NBC had a story about his saying, you know, we are doing these things against Russia. He just doesn't want us to talk about them. So it's very hard to discern what American policy is. It seems there is a kind of verbal Trump policy and an actual policy that's much tougher.\n\nSHAPIRO: David, you've been critical of President Trump's reluctance to criticize Putin, and yet the actions of the United States in this case seem to be pretty tough on Russia.\n\nBROOKS: Yeah, I think the actions are pretty good. We worked multilaterally. We reacted. And it seemed like a pretty normal American administration doing the normal, right American thing. I think what - I think I still say it's insufficient. My thinking on all this is that their Trump is better than our Trump, that Putin, like Trump...\n\nSHAPIRO: (Laughter).\n\nBROOKS: ...Succeeds by blowing up the system and by threatening to blow up the system, in this case the nation state system. He did that in Crimea. He did that in Ukraine. He did that in Syria. And he's done it here. I mean, poisoning people on an English - British territory is a complete violation of norms of how you do statecraft. And he's willing to do that. And then we do our expulsions, but he ups the ante. I'm really struck by how he wants this. He wants to go higher and higher. And so he's pretty good at using his power as a disrupter to really mess with the world.\n\nSHAPIRO: Although...\n\nDIONNE: If...\n\nSHAPIRO: If his goal has been to undermine NATO and the European Union and these other Western alliances, his actions sure seem to have brought those countries together in this case.\n\nDIONNE: Right. I mean, some of his actions - the interference with the elections has actually weakened NATO, and you've had victories or strong votes for parties that Putin seemed to be helping that hurt the cause of NATO solidarity. And yet this poisoning has really brought people together. And the other striking thing about Trump is he absolutely does not want to say or even do anything about Russian disruption of our election, whereas the Europeans have actually done much more about this in their cases.\n\nBROOKS: Yeah, I'm struck by the fact that he's picked on Theresa May and Trump particularly and how he's - Putin has responded. And there could be an attempt just to humiliate people. And so in the short term, we have - as West, have united and acted in common. But in the long term, if we can't force Putin to stop doing this kind of behavior, it'll be a humiliating setback for the...\n\nSHAPIRO: All right, from one powerful adversary to another worrying scenario, North Korea - really interesting situation where Kim Jong Un in his first-known international trip visited China and met with China's leader and was feted by the Chinese. All of this is a prelude to a potential Trump-Kim meeting. Where do you think this is going?\n\nDIONNE: Well, I think that the Chinese and the North Koreans have had a very close and strong alliance. And on the one hand, China did not want any talks going forward without their having a strong role. And so this is clearly China asserting itself. But it's also a real warning to the United States that China right now is in a mood to really start pushing American influence out of Asia. They don't want any deal that will weaken their position. They certainly don't want a united Korea. And so I think this shows what the United States is up against and how complicated and difficult these talks with President Trump are going to be.\n\nSHAPIRO: David, do you think this China-North Korea meeting is helpful or harmful to American interests with North Korea?\n\nBROOKS: Probably harmful. I guess I'm mostly struck by the fact that we don't seem to be taking the initiative, that in each case, North Korea takes the initiative. They decide to build the missiles. We react. They decide to offer talks. We react. They decide to go to China. We react. And so they seem to have a - an aggressive - an assertive strategy.\n\nThe final thing I'd say is when I get the chance to have off-the-record conversations with foreign policymakers, I sometimes ask them, like, you know more than we know. Is it scarier with your base of knowledge the North Korea situation, or is it less scary? And without exception, they always say, oh, it's much scarier.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nDIONNE: God help us. And by the way, when North Korea isn't taking the initiative, South Korea is taking the initiative, and it's, again, a sign of what appears to be the relative weakness of our position.\n\nSHAPIRO: All right, well, every week, we ask you about the latest prominent departure from the Trump administration.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSHAPIRO: This week, it was the secretary for Veterans Affairs, David Shulkin. He'd been criticized by the VA inspector general. He suggested he was fired because he was against privatizing VA services. David, what do you think is going on here?\n\nBROOKS: Well, I think Shulkin wasn't seen as a team player like everyone else in the administration. And Trump wants to get people he really feels comfortable involved. The larger issue is the issue of populism. It is a tenet of populism, whether of right or left - is that experience isn't that important, and having some purity of soul or having some good relationship with the president is important. I happen to think experience is extremely important, especially in an administration. And to pick someone who, no matter - everyone says this guy Jackson is a wonderful human being.\n\nSHAPIRO: This is Ronny Jackson, the president's doctor.\n\nBROOKS: Who was - who is now nominated. And but to run the second-largest bureaucracy in the U.S. government without any administrative experience or health care administrative experience strikes me as putting him in an impossible position.\n\nSHAPIRO: E.J.?\n\nDIONNE: Right. I'd never seen in Washington such unanimity on two propositions. One, he's a really nice guy. Two, he's utterly unprepared to run this sprawling agency. Shulkin had some real problems on this travel. He reimbursed the government. But if travel is a big problem, then there were a lot of other Cabinet secretaries, including the head of EPA, who might - Scott Pruitt, who had faced these problems.\n\nI do think there is politics here. Shulkin approved some contracting out at the VA, but he was resolutely opposed to wholesale privatization or huge steps in that direction. And with Rear Admiral Jackson, there's no sense that he has any strong views on this. But there is a fear and a suspicion among opponents of privatization that this is a step in that direction. And we will see. I think Jackson's going to have a really rough time on Capitol Hill because of his lack of experience 'cause veterans are a group with a lot of supporters in both parties on Capitol Hill.\n\nBROOKS: Can you imagine working in a workplace where senior executives were fired every single week - would be tough.\n\nSHAPIRO: A lot of people in Washington don't have to imagine it.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSHAPIRO: David Brooks and E.J. Dionne, thanks for coming in.\n\nDIONNE: Thank you.\n\nBROOKS: Thank you.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

It is a tradition that dates back to the Coolidge administration in the 1920s and was President Trump's and first lady Melania Trump's first time taking part in the event since moving into the White House.\n\nThe ceremony comes a day after the president reiterated a pledge he's echoed many times since becoming a candidate in 2015 to end the so-called war on Christmas. At a speech Wednesday in Missouri to publicize the GOP tax overhaul expected to come up for a vote in the Senate this week, President Trump kicked off his remarks by saying: \"I told you that we would be saying Merry Christmas again, right?\"\n\nHere's a closer look at the president's claim.\n\nCLAIM: President Trump will return the phrase Merry Christmas to the White House\n\n\"With Trump as your president, we are going to be celebrating Merry Christmas again, and it's going to be done with a big, beautiful tax cut.\"\n\nWhile it is still unclear if congressional Republicans can deliver that tax overhaul Trump is so eager to sign into law, checking to see if \"Merry Christmas\" actually left presidential vernacular is a bit easier to answer.\n\nFirst a little context.\n\nPresident Trump's charge that \"you don't see Merry Christmas anymore\" appeared to be directed at his predecessor former President Barack Obama and the apparent claim that Obama seemed to favor the more inclusive seasonal phrase \"Happy Holidays.\"\n\nSome of those who share President Trump's view of the previous administration point to the Obama White House's official holiday cards that read \"Happy Holidays.\" Former Rep. Joe Walsh, who is now a conservative pundit, tweeted Wednesday:\n\n\"The Trump family's first Christmas card contains a word that was noticeably absent from all eight of Obama's Christmas cards: CHRISTMAS!\"\n\nTodd Starnes of Fox News earlier this week penned an article thanking Trump for bringing \"Merry Christmas\" back to the White House.\n\nBut a quick search of the Web and social media returns many examples of when Obama used the phrase \"Merry Christmas.\" In fact, in his weekly address on Christmas Eve 2016, literally the first words out of the former president's mouth were: \"Merry Christmas, everybody.\"\n\nFormer President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama in 2016 YouTube\n\nHere are tweeted photos from the prior years:\n\nIn 2015, Obama tweeted \"Merry Christmas, and happy holidays to you and yours.\"\n\nIn 2014, Obama tweeted \"Have a merry Christmas.\"\n\nAnd in 2013, Obama went with a simple \"Merry Christmas.\"\n\nAs one journalist pointed out on social media this week, the Obama administration said \"Merry Christmas\" annually for eight years.\n\nWell, perhaps Trump was suggesting the George W. Bush administration did not say \"Merry Christmas\"? Nope, that administration did so too, including in 2008 when former President Bush spoke to U.S. troops stationed in Iraq.\n\nHow about the Clinton administration? President Bill Clinton did so too.\n\nFormer President and First Lady Bill and Hillary Clinton wish Americans Merry Christmas in Dec. 2000 YouTube YouTube\n\nSo the reality is, as best we can tell, \"Merry Christmas\" never left the White House.", "keywords": ["restore", "pledge", "check", "fact", "christmas", "obama", "tweeted", "white", "merry", "trumps", "president", "administration", "week", "trump", "house"], "polarity": 0.1803053830227743, "subjectivity": 0.2723084886128365},

Half a dozen people occupy the blue velvet booths and alternative dance music blares overhead. Leigh Salinas walks in carrying a duffel bag. She's there to spend the weekend studying \u2013 sort of.\n\n\"I was certainly impacted by the presidential election in a lot of the ways that other people were,\" says the 31-year-old who works as an accountant for a local food company.\n\nSalinas says she wants to run for local office.\n\n\"It's easier, at least at first, to make a change at a local level,\" she says. \"So, that's why I'm super excited about this program specifically.\"\n\nLeigh Salinas is one of 25 participants in the inaugural ATXelerator, run by an area nonprofit called The Center for Austin's Future. The idea is to train and educate potential candidates for local office \u2013 specifically city council or various local boards and commissions.\n\nWhat makes the ATXelerator different from other candidate schools is that it's also part tech accelerator. In a normal accelerator, participants pitch a business idea and vie for investor money. Here, they will pitch themselves as a candidate for local office and vie for campaign support.\n\n\"Competition brings out the best in people,\" says Ward Tisdale, the executive director of the center.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Gabriel C.

Then they'll face the panel.\n\n\"The competition is really meant to have people up their game and test them,\" Tisdale says. He's offering the support of a political action committee to candidates who rise to the challenge.\n\nAmos Schwartzfarb is the managing director of Techstars in Austin, one of the country's first startup accelerators. While tech accelerators have cropped up in just the past decade, Schwartzfarb says the idea \u2013 a period of time spent intensively studying something and then competing to win a title \u2013 is nothing new.\n\n\"I think back to when I was a kid and as an athlete,\" he says. \"Over the summers and over Thanksgiving breaks, I would go to these immersive camps, and the idea was you'll learn more and get fitter in two or three weeks than you would over the course of a full season, because this is all you do. You live, eat, breathe, sleep it all day long.\"\n\nSchwartzfarb says he's never heard of a tech-accelerator model being applied to local politics.\n\n\"I think it's not only a cool idea, I think it's an extremely timely idea,\" he says. \"The thought of the average person having more than just a vote as their political voice is not something that most people thought about [until the 2016 election].\"\n\nRemembrances Renowned Fixture Of Austin Streets Dies Renowned Fixture Of Austin Streets Dies Listen \u00b7 2:20 2:20\n\nIn the same way that many recruit and prep candidates to further a particular agenda, the ATXelerator is looking for a specific candidate \u2013 one who generally supports environmentally friendly and walkable development through denser construction and a larger variety of housing types.\n\n\"We are growing \u2013 a hundred people move here a day \u2013 and in order to preserve what we have in Austin, which is a great quality of life, we have to change,\" Tisdale says. \"And if we don't change, we're going to become an elitist city where only the rich can live, and it will be predominantly white and not diverse.\"\n\nThe average ATXelerator participant is 35 years old. Their career paths vary \u2013 there's a writer, the owner of a pet-sitting business, a city planner and a community college student. Just getting selected to participate is itself a competition \u2013 the current group of 25 was whittled down from 48 applicants.\n\nPatsy Woods Martin has no plans to use the accelerator model at her organization. She's Executive Director of Annie's List, which trains women and contributes to their campaigns for state and local office, and she doesn't employ a competitive process by design.\n\n\"Women have a hard time deciding to run for office, and so we want to provide the opportunity to understand the process to as many people as possible,\" she says. \"It's really important for us ... to have that funnel open as wide as possible.\"\n\nBut Kerry Tate, a longtime political consultant in Austin, says pitting accelerator participants against one another makes for a better learning process.\n\n\"To compete for funding, compete for ideas, learn how to frame or brand yourself and put yourself out there ... you may be a little more stimulated to get that done if you're competing for something,\" Tate says.\n\nAnd that's exactly what the ATXelerator is setting Leigh Salinas up to do. On the last day of the weekend retreat, the group hears a presentation on the city's demographics and transportation. There's a session on how to run a campaign featuring a former mayor and city council member. Then, time to pack up.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Gabriel C. P\u00e9rez/KUT 90.5 Gabriel C.

Then she explains how she might pitch herself as a candidate for local government.\n\n\"I'm from the business community,\" she says. \"I've just been thinking about how can I take my business skill set and my accounting skill set and my acumen with numbers and business and apply it to these city problems.\"\n\nThen she's off, headed home to take a nap after ATXelerator's kickoff retreat.

The new court-drawn map is expected to upend that tilt.\n\nJustices described their map in their 48-page decision as \"superior\" to other proposals filed for their consideration.\n\nTop statehouse Republicans have pledged to challenge the judicially enacted map, which they say amounts to overreach by the Democratic-majority court.\n\nThe court's decision comes after a monthlong standoff. When justices first declared the previous map unconstitutional on Jan. 22, they ordered the GOP-controlled Legislature and Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, to negotiate a compromise.\n\nThe justices said they wanted the new map to be fairer, specifying that districts should be more compact and contiguous and should split fewer municipalities.\n\nA compromise map never happened.\n\nAnalysis Ask Cokie: Is Gerrymandering Rigging America's Political System? Ask Cokie: Is Gerrymandering Rigging America's Political System? Listen \u00b7 4:42 4:42\n\nUltimately, House and Senate Republicans, House Democrats, Senate Democrats, Wolf and Lt. Gov. Mike Stack submitted maps completely independently.\n\nThat's in addition to one sent in by a group of Republican activists who intervened in the case and two sent in by the case's Democratic petitioners along with the League of Women Voters. All parties to the case were technically allowed to file maps.\n\nThe submitted maps varied significantly in terms of partisan advantage, though overall they all made districts more compact, and to varying degrees they divided fewer municipalities.\n\nThe various parties to the case approached the redistricting process differently. House and Senate Republicans worked largely with existing staff members who have previous Pennsylvania mapping experience. They said they didn't take partisanship into consideration at all, and they ended up with a map with a relatively similar GOP advantage to the current one.\n\nOn the other hand, Wolf, the governor, hired Tufts University professor Moon Duchin to consult on his map. Her analysis, the governor said, found that the map has \"no partisan skew in comparison to over a billion randomly generated maps.\"\n\nThe justices were advised by Nathan Persily, a Stanford law professor with a background in drawing political district maps. He has previously assisted judges in New York, Connecticut, North Carolina, Georgia and Maryland in redistricting cases.\n\n\"We're going to have a Stanford professor come into Pennsylvania, and he's going to act as the prosecutor by presenting the evidence, he's going to act as the juror by evaluating the evidence, and he solely is going to act as a judge by ultimately ruling on the evidence and producing a map \u2014 one person \u2014 to the court for the people of Pennsylvania to live under,\" state Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman said in advance of Monday's announcement.\n\nRepublicans also are calling the process foul. The court didn't file its full opinion until two days before the Legislature's deadline to submit a compromise map to Wolf.\n\nGOP leaders have said the lack of guidance is the reason they didn't start drawing a map in earnest until 48 hours before it was due \u2014 a decision that left them no time to get a vote from the Legislature. The map that they ultimately submitted was from the Legislature's two GOP leaders.\n\nStatehouse Republicans say the court is usurping the power of the legislative and executive branches, a situation that essentially creates a \"constitutional crisis.\"", "keywords": ["pennsylvania", "wolf", "map", "going", "democrats", "professor", "senate", "voting", "court", "submitted", "shift", "advantage", "courtdrawn", "republicans"], "polarity": 0.07664502164502165, "subjectivity": 0.40857413419913413},

These alternatives, which offer coverage for a limited time, are exempted from ACA rules \u2014 including the rule that bars insurers from rejecting people who have pre-existing medical conditions.\n\n\"On the one hand, they're saying they're going to enforce the ACA,\" says Sarah Lueck, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. But, Lueck adds, the Health and Human Services Department also seems to say, \" 'if you want to roll back protections for people with pre-existing conditions, we have some ideas for you.' And that concerns me.\"\n\nIdaho's approach, announced in January, would have allowed insurers to offer \"state-based\" insurance plans that did not include some of the ACA's consumer protections. A few weeks later, Idaho Blue Cross jumped in with five \"Freedom Blue\" state-based plans it hoped to sell.\n\nRegulators in other states were watching the Idaho situation. Its move was viewed either as a brazen effort to flout federal law or an innovative attempt to stabilize the market. Regardless, Idaho's action meant the Trump administration had to take a position: Enforce the ACA or look away.\n\nHere are four key takeaways from the administration's response to Idaho, and how the ruling may play elsewhere.\n\nStates and insurance carriers can't ignore federal law\n\nAlthough Thursday's letter from Seema Verma, head of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, commended Idaho's effort to \"address the damage\" caused by the ACA, it said that, as proposed, the state-based plans would violate at least eight of the federal health law's provisions. For example, the ACA forbids insurers from charging sick people more for a policy than it charges those who are considered healthy; it bans the establishment of annual or lifetime coverage caps; and it won't allow insurers to reject applicants who have pre-existing conditions.\n\nVerma's letter noted that if plans that don't meet ACA standards were sold in Idaho, insurance carriers might face significant financial penalties. Health policy specialists say they would be surprised if insurers would want to take that risk.\n\n\"It's one thing for the state to take on the CMS, but quite another for carriers,\" says Jan Dubauskas, general counsel for the IHC Group, which sells short-term health insurance nationally. \"When I heard that, I thought, 'This is the end for state-based plans.' \"\n\nBut Idaho Gov. Butch Otter, a Republican, has been upbeat, saying the letter from Verma \"was not a rejection of our approach,\" but \"an invitation ... to continue discussing ... what can and cannot be included in state-based plans.\"\n\nLate Friday, Idaho Blue Cross issued a statement expressing disappointment in the CMS decision, but also echoing Otter's willingness to move forward.\n\nThe timetable going forward is not immediately clear, although both federal regulators and state officials say they are willing to talk about alternatives to Idaho's original proposal. Following Verma's suggestion to get new short-term plans on the market would also require Idaho's insurers to consider their options, modify the plans and come up with new premium rates \u2014 all of which takes time.\n\nShort-term plans get another boost\n\nDubauskas and others say the Idaho decision could increase interest in short-term plans.\n\nSuch policies have been sold for years, meant as a stopgap for people between jobs. They are less expensive than ACA plans, mainly because they are allowed to reject people who have health conditions (or exclude coverage for such conditions) and have other limitations.\n\nMost short-term plans don't cover treatment for substance abuse or mental health issues; few cover maternity care and some don't include prescription drug coverage. They generally can't be renewed \u2014 meaning consumers must reapply and answer medical questions each time their policies expire.\n\nThe Obama administration, fearing that short-term plans would suck relatively healthy people out of the ACA market, limited such policies to 90-day terms. The Trump administration, however, has proposed allowing short-term plans to last for up to a year. These final rules aren't expected for at least another two months.\n\nIronically, Idaho Insurance Director Dean Cameron had in January promoted the more robust \"state-based\" plans \u2014 like those the Blues insurer wanted to sell in Idaho\u2014 as an alternative to short-term coverage.\n\nAfter getting the CMS letter, Cameron told the Idaho Statesman newspaper that short-term plans might be easier for the Trump administration to handle legally, but could cause consumers more problems than what Idaho had proposed.\n\nCritics fear that consumers will buy such plans without understanding their limitations.\n\n\"They might think it's health insurance like they're used to,\" Lueck says. \"But it's really not. It's really very bare-bones.\"\n\nState reactions will vary widely, creating different rules around the country\n\nEven if the Trump administration's proposal to extend short-term coverage to a full year is finalized, states can set stricter rules.\n\nA handful of states already do.\n\nNew York and New Jersey require many of the same rules as the ACA for policies sold in their states. But insurers won't sell short-term plans there.\n\nFour states \u2014 Arizona, Michigan, Minnesota and Oregon \u2014 limit the length of short-term plans sold in their states to 185 days, according to a survey by the Commonwealth Fund and researchers at Georgetown University.\n\n\"A small group of largely blue states have some regulation [of short-term plans], but not very many,\" says Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute. \"It's possible that if this rule is finalized we will see more states start to step up and regulate short-term markets.\"\n\nConversely, lawmakers in other states may promote short-term coverage as a lower-cost alternative to the ACA \u2014 although people with pre-existing conditions may not be able to buy such plans.\n\n\"Politically, short-term plans have some appeal because lawmakers can say now there's a cheaper option out there,\" Corlette notes.\n\nThe increased emphasis on short-term plans could increase premiums\n\nActuaries fear that short-term plans \u2014 or state-based plans like those rejected in Idaho \u2014 would drive up costs for people who remain in more comprehensive ACA coverage.\n\nThat's because younger and healthier people might be tempted to drop their ACA coverage, leaving only those who are older, sicker and costlier in the remaining pool. That, in turn, drives up premiums \u2014 affecting millions of Americans who don't receive subsidies and already struggle to pay for their health insurance.\n\nBut just how many people would jump to new, short-term coverage?\n\nThe Trump administration has estimated that about 100,000 to 200,000 people with existing ACA coverage would make the shift, while other specialists in health insurance suggest higher numbers.\n\nChristopher Condeluci, a Washington, D.C., attorney who specializes in employee benefits and previously served as the tax and benefits counsel to the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, says it's unclear which estimates are correct.\n\nThe real issue to keep in mind, Condeluci says, is that an increasing number of people who don't get subsidies are already choosing to either forgo coverage or pick an alternative, such as a short-term plan.\n\n\"People are voting with their feet,\" he said. \"That cannot be overlooked.\"\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

Did everybody cry?' \" Zachary says.\n\n\"And he raised a hand, which told me to shut up. And he said three words: 'It was awful.' \"\n\nAfter meeting Zachary, The Race Card Project team conducted its own reporting and discovered that invitations to hangings in the early 20th century were fairly common. \"In fact, in Montana, they were required by law,\" Norris tells Morning Edition's Steve Inskeep. \"And Carol Zachary's grandfather was a county auditor, so he, by law, would have been required to attend that hanging.\"\n\nThe photos that accompany the invitation \u2014 of the three men sentenced to be hanged \u2014 are each marked with the man's name and nickname. Curiously, Norris says, they don't look like mug shots. The men are dressed up. They are wearing ties and suit jackets. \"They look like professionally lit portraitures,\" Norris notes.\n\nZachary told The Race Card project that she has always wondered whether the event was a lynching. But when she traveled to White Sulphur Springs to learn more, she found out that the hanging was legal \u2014 a fact independently confirmed by The Race Card Project team.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Butte-Silver Bow Public Archives Butte-Silver Bow Public Archives\n\nEven so, Zachary still wonders how, or if, race may have been a factor in the case.\n\n\"It was a legal hanging,\" Norris explains. \"These three men were arrested for a murder that took place in the commission of a robbery. Very little is known about these men. They were said to have been railroad workers. They were called hobos in some accounts, itinerant workers. And it was the first legal triple-hanging in the state of Montana. It was a pretty big deal.\"\n\nIn reporting this story, the Race Card Project team also learned that there had been some controversy around the execution \u2014 there had even been an effort to commute the sentence.\n\n\"We came across a very thorough newspaper account in the Anaconda Standard, an article published in Butte, Mont., on the day of the hanging \u2014 Feb. 16, 1917,\" Norris says. \"The article quoted then-Montana Gov. Samuel Stewart at length, and the governor himself said he was concerned that perhaps the race of these men may have been a factor. And he determined that it was not, based on the evidence that was presented at trial. He denied clemency [and] the three men were hanged all at the same time on the morning of Feb. 16.\"\n\nWhile the team helped uncover some of the story behind these six words, and the invitation, there is still more that's not known \u2014 and that still troubles Zachary.\n\n\"It's not at all a case-closed issue for Carol Zachary. There's still a lot of mystery involving this,\" Norris says. \"The mystery of those photos and why they looked like that. The mystery of why her grandfather gave her the envelope and, despite the fact that it was a legal hanging, said it was awful. She wrestles with this. And she's careful to point out that she's not trying to say that this hanging was a mistake or some kind of miscarriage of justice, but she says it just feels incomplete to her.\"\n\nWhen Zachary first saw that envelope as a 9-year old, she was fascinated by it. But now, when she talks about the process of pulling out that envelope as an adult, she approaches it with something much closer to dread.\n\n\"I couldn't believe what I saw. I remembered them as being very fierce, but as I laid them out there [years later], they were three stunningly beautiful young black men,\" Zachary says.\n\nAs an adult who has lived a life, has children of her own and has her own opinions about the death penalty, she looks at these pictures today and wonders about the message in that gesture \u2014 the fact that her grandfather gave her the envelope.\n\n\"One of the things she wonders is if he wanted her to understand that some things shouldn't make us feel good,\" Norris says. \"That even if this was a legally sanctioned hanging, that, in the end, it's the taking of someone's life \u2014 and some things shouldn't feel satisfying, even when they're dictated or sanctioned by law.\"", "keywords": ["zachary", "men", "race", "memento", "woman", "hanging", "project", "family", "norris", "disturbing", "grandfather", "carol", "card", "wrestles", "envelope"], "polarity": 0.08309132996632998, "subjectivity": 0.4417508417508417},

The proposed budget would cut the office's $15.4 million in funding and the 54 positions that are currently authorized.\n\nThis move would essentially gut a key agency that helps broker compromise in these hyperpartisan times, says Grande Lum, the former director of the CRS. He tells Here & Now's Robin Young he is concerned that moving the agency closer to prosecutors will deter people from requesting help for fear of a lawsuit.\n\n\"What's important is that for parties to be willing to come to the table, they need to be comfortable that whatever is said is held confidential, and that they are not at any potential danger of being prosecuted here,\" says Lum, who is now director of the Divided Community Project at Ohio State University. \"So moving it, the function, to the Civil Rights Division would effectively end its function.\"\n\nIn its more than 50-year history, the CRS has helped protect the First Amendment and keep people safe during the Selma-to-Montgomery marches, eased tensions during desegregation in Boston, and aided in resolving the Native American standoff at Wounded Knee, S.D., in 1973.\n\nJustice Department official Lee Loftus told reporters in February the CRS is a \"small entity in Justice today.\"\n\n\"We are very aware that there are some potential issues if you combine them, because there needs to be some segregation between CRS and its responsibilities under the Civil Rights Act and the functions that [the Civil Rights Division] may have in its regular investigative and prosecution responsibilities,\" Loftus said.\n\nThe CRS has long faced backlash from those on the right. The Heritage Foundation has described the agency as \"highly politicized\" and said it has \"actually escalated local tensions in such places as Ferguson, Missouri, and Florida following the arrest of George Zimmerman.\"\n\nBut those who have sought the CRS's help tell a different story. After the killing of Travyon Martin in 2012, Mayor Jeff Triplett invited CRS mediators to Sanford, Fla., to hold meetings between local officials and the thousands of protesters who descended on the city.\n\n\"I'd hate to say that we couldn't have done it without [CRS], but I'd much rather learn from someone else's experience rather than my own misfortune,\" he said.\n\nTriplett told MSNBC in 2013 that the city was overwhelmed by the massive influx of protesters, and the CRS helped local officials properly prepare for demonstrations during the weeks-long trial that followed.\n\n\"There were dozens of protests, but there was not a single arrest, not a single glass bottle thrown,\" Lum says. \"We were able to have ... free speech, and we were able to maintain public safety.\"\n\nIn a time of deep political divisions, the changes being proposed could slash the prospect of healing communities and reaching compromise, Lum says.\n\nPart of the problem is that political identities are growing more and more personal. The Pew Research Center measured a growing disdain for the opposing party from 1994 to 2014 with 43 percent of Republicans and 38 percent of Democrats viewing the opposite party very unfavorably.\n\nAfter the violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., last summer, an independent review concluded the Charlottesville Police Department should have responded to community criticism before the demonstration took place. In the aftermath of that attack, Charlottesville officials did request help from the CRS in recovery efforts.\n\n\"Community engagement is paramount for proactive, effective policing,\" the report noted. \"CPD must commit on an ongoing basis to being a citizen-centric partner in promoting community well-being rather than a reactive, independent force.\"\n\nLum acknowledges the difficulty of engaging critics when they are radical groups like neo-Nazis or gun rights enthusiasts, but he says conflict resolution techniques employed by CRS can help \"tell the third story.\"\n\n\"It's the ability to focus first on what matters \u2014 'OK, I wanna hear your story, I have my story,\" Lum says. \"But what's a story that we can both agree to?' In gun control, we wanna prevent tragedies.

Patrick Leahy of Vermont. Overall, Weinstein and his former wife and current wife have given just over $1 million, according to Federal Election Commission records processed by Political MoneyLine. About $850,000 is from Weinstein himself. He also bundled, helping to raise an unknown amount of other people's money donated to Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nBy comparison, the Center for Responsive Politics says San Francisco billionaire Tom Steyer gave Democrats and liberal groups $91 million just in the 2015-16 election cycle.\n\nDespite his frequent checks to candidates and party committees, which raise their money under tight contribution limits, Weinstein never ventured into the deep end of political giving, where America's wealthiest political players write seven- or eight-figure checks to largely unregulated super PACs. And his companies, Miramax and the Weinstein Company, don't appear in federal disclosure reports.\n\nHis personal giving was outweighed by two other factors. He was a leader in a famously liberal industry. And as a bundler, he delivered much more in other people's money than he gave on his own. It all led to close connections with top-tier Democrats.\n\nWhen President Barack Obama visited Weinstein's home in 2012 for a fundraiser, Weinstein told the $35,800-per-ticket crowd, \"You can make the case that he's the Paul Newman of American presidents.\"\n\nThe New York Times once described Weinstein as \"a family friend\" of Bill and Hillary Clinton. And when host Charlie Rose interviewed him on CBS This Morning in 2012, they had this exchange.\n\nRose: \"So Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, which of those three is your favorite?\"\n\nWeinstein: \"I have no favorites. It's like the Beatles.\"\n\nThis week, Barack and Michelle Obama, whose eldest daughter recently interned for the Weinstein Company, issued a statement saying they \"have been disgusted\" by the accounts of Weinstein's actions, while Hillary Clinton told CNN that his conduct \"was just intolerable in every way.\"\n\nMuch of Weinstein's cash went to either the Democratic National Committee or the party's House and Senate campaign committees. But the longest list of beneficiaries \u2014 now the longest list of politicians purging his contributions \u2014 is on the Senate side of the Capitol. Over the years, he gave to 30 Senate hopefuls \u2014 including Weinstein's sole Republican recipient, 2010 Senate candidate John Chachas in Nevada.\n\nThirteen Weinstein recipients are now sitting senators, and 12 have said they're getting rid of his money. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who got a total of $1,375 from Weinstein, said that she's contributing $10,000 to a women's shelter in Los Angeles. And Hillary Clinton has said she intends to donate Weinstein's past contributions to charity.\n\nMike Fraioli, a veteran Democratic fundraiser, said Weinstein's exit from Democratic politics won't matter. \"There may have been a time when one individual was make or break,\" Fraioli said, but it's gone. \"There's just so much money in the system now.\"", "keywords": ["political", "weinstein", "money", "cash", "clinton", "democrats", "impact", "democratic", "senate", "obama", "weinsteins", "likely", "purge", "low", "party", "hillary"], "polarity": 0.08364571035025582, "subjectivity": 0.42334464777646585},

But, it's not clear that it's benefitting Donald Trump.\n\nAILSA CHANG, HOST:\n\nWhere President Trump goes, controversy seems to follow. But despite that, his standing with the public seemed to firm up in some recent polls, perhaps in part because of the booming economy. And that has raised one of the central questions of the midterm elections - whether the economy will help Republicans keep control. NPR political correspondent Asma Khalid reports.\n\nASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Allen Cowan considers himself a socially liberal, fiscally conservative kind of guy, the kind of voter who reluctantly chose Donald Trump.\n\nALLEN COWAN: I held my nose at the voting booth.\n\nKHALID: But these days, Cowan, a 50-year-old in West Virginia, says he is quite pleased with an aspect of the Trump era.\n\nCOWAN: Financially speaking, I cannot complain. My retirement I have through my employer has shown a remarkable increase.\n\nKHALID: The thing is, Cowan says that strong economy doesn't change his overall opinion of the president.\n\nCOWAN: I can look at President Trump and be like, OK, his policies in regards to the economy and stuff are good for the nation. But I'm still going to think, President Trump, the whole kit and caboodle, is a bitter pill to swallow.\n\nKHALID: And Cowan is not alone. Trump's approval ratings are, on average, not as high as you would expect given the country's low unemployment numbers, soaring stock market and expanding economy. But even though people might feel optimistic about the economy, GOP pollster David Winston says many people are still not feeling financially secure on a personal level.\n\nDAVID WINSTON: People are still sort of assessing, is this just a sort of a temporary moment with the economy, or is this something longer-term that they can have some confidence in that will let them then economically behave differently?\n\nKHALID: Still, if Republicans are going to pick one issue to focus on in the midterms, one issue they think could give them a boost, it's the economy and taxes. Winston says it's imperative for Republicans to sell the tax plan. And Trump was bragging about the economy yesterday at a rally in Ohio.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Unemployment claims are at their lowest level in 45 years - lowest level, 45 years.\n\n(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)\n\nKHALID: He then told his supporters they need to show up in the midterms to keep this economy rolling.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nTRUMP: We can't lose that by getting hurt in the midterms, so we can't be complacent. There's never been an economy like this. Everyone says it's the most important thing.\n\nKHALID: But the idea that good economic conditions have a direct effect on swinging seats in midterms is something Alan Abramowitz questions. He's a professor at Emory University. He's looked at the results of every midterm dating back to World War II.\n\nALAN ABRAMOWITZ: The approval rating is a much - itself is a much better predictor of what's going to happen in midterm elections than any measure of economic trends.\n\nKHALID: Sure, the economy can factor into a president's approval numbers, but Abramowitz says when the economy and a president's approval rating are not in sync, the approval rating tends to be far more important.\n\nABRAMOWITZ: We saw something very similar back in the 1960s. And, you know, in 1966, we had a midterm election. Lyndon Johnson was in the White House. And, you know, the war in Vietnam was escalating, and his approval rating had dropped. But the economy was very strong.\n\nKHALID: Long story short, Democrats lost 47 House seats that year. So an economy that's chugging along may not be enough for voters to credit the party in power, meaning Republicans need to figure out a way to tie the economy to how voters feel about the president before November so long as the economy stays in good shape.

He also spoke more generally about his record during his first year in office. \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocious way,\" Trump said. \"There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\"\n\nHere's a closer look at some of the president's claims.\n\nCLAIM: The GOP tax plan is primarily aimed at workers on the lower rungs of the income ladder.\n\n\"Our focus is on helping the folks who work in the mailrooms and the machine shops of America,\" Trump said. \"The plumbers, the carpenters, the cops, the teachers, the truck drivers, the pipe fitters. The people that like me best.\"\n\nSome elements of the GOP plan would benefit such workers, including a larger standard deduction and an expanded child tax credit. But blue-collar workers are hardly the bill's main focus. According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, less than 20 percent of the total tax savings in 2019 would go to workers making $87,400 or less (the bottom 60 percent of the income distribution). These workers fare even worse after 2025, when the individual tax cuts in the Senate bill are set to expire. By 2027, people making less than $54,700 would see a tax increase under the Senate bill, while those making between $54,700 and $93,200 would see a modest cut, accounting for less than 3 percent of the bill's total tax savings.\n\nCLAIM: The GOP tax plan is hard on rich people, like President Trump.\n\n\"This is going to cost me a fortune, this thing, believe me. This is not good for me,\" Trump said. \"I have some very wealthy friends, not so happy with me. But that's OK.\"\n\nUpper-income taxpayers would be the biggest beneficiaries of the GOP plans to reduce the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and to lower taxes on so-called pass-through companies, which are taxed at the individual rate. They would also benefit from elimination of the alternative minimum tax and their heirs would benefit from a higher threshold on the inheritance tax. According to the Tax Policy Center, 63 percent of the total savings from the Senate bill in 2019 would go to taxpayers earning more than $150,100 (the top 20 percent of earners), while nearly a quarter would go to the top 5 percent \u2014 people making upwards of $303,200.\n\nTop earners do even better after 2025, when the individual tax cuts expire but other provisions continue. By 2027, 90 percent of the total tax savings go to people making more than $154,900 (the top 20 percent of earners) and nearly 62 percent go to the top 1 percent \u2014 people making more than $912,100.\n\nCLAIM: Job growth has surged under President Trump.\n\n\"We've created nearly 2 million jobs,\" Trump said. \"Think of it. We used to lose millions. Now we've created 2 million jobs since I won the election.\"\n\nThe U.S. job market continues to improve, with unemployment in October falling to its lowest level in 17 years. (November job numbers will be out next week.) Since February \u2014 Trump's first full month in office \u2014 U.S. employers have added an average of 169,000 jobs each month. This is slightly below the pace of 199,000 jobs per month during the comparable period in 2016.\n\nCLAIM: Economic growth has surged under President Trump.\n\n\"The Commerce Department announced this morning that our GDP, that's the big one, in the third quarter, grew even faster than they reported previously,\" Trump said. \"Now it comes in at 3.3 percent, which is the largest increase in many years. And if we didn't have the hurricanes, we would have been at 4 percent.\"\n\nGross domestic product, or GDP, is the broadest estimate of the U.S. economy, and the Commerce Department did say Wednesday that GDP grew at 3.3 percent between July and September \u2014 an upward revision from the department's earlier estimate. The last time GDP grew that rapidly was in 2014. Forecasters anticipate somewhat slower growth in the last three months of the year. Macroeconomic Advisers, for example, is predicting fourth-quarter growth of 2.5 percent.\n\nAnalysts originally expected that a spate of hurricanes would temporarily depress growth in the third quarter, but that didn't happen. In fact, by closing ports, the storms may have slowed imports and temporarily boosted GDP.\n\nCLAIM: Speaking of hurricanes ...\n\nPresident Trump acknowledged that Puerto Rico has not bounced back as quickly from storm damage as Texas and Florida.\n\n\"Puerto Rico has been a very tough situation because of the fact that it was in very, very bad shape before the storms ever hit,\" the president said. \"But they're doing well there and it's healing and it's getting better. And we're getting them power and all of the things they have to have.\"\n\nConditions in Puerto Rico have slowly improved since Hurricane Maria struck more than two months ago.

He faces a primary challenge by Marie Newman, who is more liberal.\n\nUp until Jones came on the scene, that was the only story coming out of this race.\n\nSmith says that even in Democratic strongholds, getting a viable Republican name on the ballot is an investment worth making \u2014 not just when it prevents a self-proclaimed Nazi from stealing the party's nod.\n\n\"I think sometimes as the underdog party, we're a little too relaxed in believing that it's a fight not worth standing up to,\" she said. \"Sometimes we roll over before we try, but I think we should put emphasis in every district.\"\n\nSo for her first time voting for Congress in her new district, Smith says she will cast her vote for the Democrat.\n\nBrady says he hopes other Republicans will do the same.\n\n\"We need to inform people that this is not a guy who shares our values, not a guy anybody should vote for, and you should get out in that district and vote for a Democrat,\" he said.\n\nCurrent Illinois GOP leadership says it is exploring other options to prevent Jones from winning, including encouraging voters to write in a candidate they have yet to find.", "keywords": ["supremacist", "districts", "white", "congress", "illinois", "seat", "ballot", "republican", "running", "jones", "vote", "gop", "party", "district"], "polarity": 0.0848599981578705, "subjectivity": 0.41777194436768905},

Half a dozen people occupy the blue velvet booths and alternative dance music blares overhead. Leigh Salinas walks in carrying a duffel bag. She's there to spend the weekend studying \u2013 sort of.\n\n\"I was certainly impacted by the presidential election in a lot of the ways that other people were,\" says the 31-year-old who works as an accountant for a local food company.\n\nSalinas says she wants to run for local office.\n\n\"It's easier, at least at first, to make a change at a local level,\" she says. \"So, that's why I'm super excited about this program specifically.\"\n\nLeigh Salinas is one of 25 participants in the inaugural ATXelerator, run by an area nonprofit called The Center for Austin's Future. The idea is to train and educate potential candidates for local office \u2013 specifically city council or various local boards and commissions.\n\nWhat makes the ATXelerator different from other candidate schools is that it's also part tech accelerator. In a normal accelerator, participants pitch a business idea and vie for investor money. Here, they will pitch themselves as a candidate for local office and vie for campaign support.\n\n\"Competition brings out the best in people,\" says Ward Tisdale, the executive director of the center.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Gabriel C.

Then they'll face the panel.\n\n\"The competition is really meant to have people up their game and test them,\" Tisdale says. He's offering the support of a political action committee to candidates who rise to the challenge.\n\nAmos Schwartzfarb is the managing director of Techstars in Austin, one of the country's first startup accelerators. While tech accelerators have cropped up in just the past decade, Schwartzfarb says the idea \u2013 a period of time spent intensively studying something and then competing to win a title \u2013 is nothing new.\n\n\"I think back to when I was a kid and as an athlete,\" he says. \"Over the summers and over Thanksgiving breaks, I would go to these immersive camps, and the idea was you'll learn more and get fitter in two or three weeks than you would over the course of a full season, because this is all you do. You live, eat, breathe, sleep it all day long.\"\n\nSchwartzfarb says he's never heard of a tech-accelerator model being applied to local politics.\n\n\"I think it's not only a cool idea, I think it's an extremely timely idea,\" he says. \"The thought of the average person having more than just a vote as their political voice is not something that most people thought about [until the 2016 election].\"\n\nRemembrances Renowned Fixture Of Austin Streets Dies Renowned Fixture Of Austin Streets Dies Listen \u00b7 2:20 2:20\n\nIn the same way that many recruit and prep candidates to further a particular agenda, the ATXelerator is looking for a specific candidate \u2013 one who generally supports environmentally friendly and walkable development through denser construction and a larger variety of housing types.\n\n\"We are growing \u2013 a hundred people move here a day \u2013 and in order to preserve what we have in Austin, which is a great quality of life, we have to change,\" Tisdale says. \"And if we don't change, we're going to become an elitist city where only the rich can live, and it will be predominantly white and not diverse.\"\n\nThe average ATXelerator participant is 35 years old. Their career paths vary \u2013 there's a writer, the owner of a pet-sitting business, a city planner and a community college student. Just getting selected to participate is itself a competition \u2013 the current group of 25 was whittled down from 48 applicants.\n\nPatsy Woods Martin has no plans to use the accelerator model at her organization. She's Executive Director of Annie's List, which trains women and contributes to their campaigns for state and local office, and she doesn't employ a competitive process by design.\n\n\"Women have a hard time deciding to run for office, and so we want to provide the opportunity to understand the process to as many people as possible,\" she says. \"It's really important for us ... to have that funnel open as wide as possible.\"\n\nBut Kerry Tate, a longtime political consultant in Austin, says pitting accelerator participants against one another makes for a better learning process.\n\n\"To compete for funding, compete for ideas, learn how to frame or brand yourself and put yourself out there ... you may be a little more stimulated to get that done if you're competing for something,\" Tate says.\n\nAnd that's exactly what the ATXelerator is setting Leigh Salinas up to do. On the last day of the weekend retreat, the group hears a presentation on the city's demographics and transportation. There's a session on how to run a campaign featuring a former mayor and city council member. Then, time to pack up.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Gabriel C. P\u00e9rez/KUT 90.5 Gabriel C.

Then she explains how she might pitch herself as a candidate for local government.\n\n\"I'm from the business community,\" she says. \"I've just been thinking about how can I take my business skill set and my accounting skill set and my acumen with numbers and business and apply it to these city problems.\"\n\nThen she's off, headed home to take a nap after ATXelerator's kickoff retreat.

The Florida Senate approved a bill last weekend that would cover lost wages for first responders with PTSD, and the House followed suit on Monday.\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott is now saying he will sign the bill.\n\n\"I intend to sign it as soon it makes it to my desk,\" Scott said, speaking at an event to honor firefighters who died in the line of duty. \"What this will do is ensure firefighters suffering from PTSD can receive workers' comp benefits.\"\n\nAbout a third of states have similar laws. Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis, also the state fire marshal, called PTSD a \"hidden killer.\"\n\n\"This benefit is needed so we ensure that our firefighters don't have this as their only option, our first responders don't look to suicide as the outlet to sort through the demons they deal with and these horrific images,\" Patronis said.\n\nChanging the law has not been easy. Legislation was introduced after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando two years ago. That shooting left 49 people dead. At least three first responders to the shooting have publicly disclosed that they have been diagnosed with PTSD.\n\nThe bill languished in Florida's Republican-dominated Legislature last year, and a related measure's prospects had been uncertain this year. The Florida League of Cities, for example, raised concerns about the costs to local governments that pay for police and fire departments.\n\nI have good days, and I have really bad days, and everything in between. Every day, I walk through a different part of hell and have to figure out how to navigate it.\n\nBut after the Feb. 14 high school shooting in Parkland, in which 17 people died, opposition to the bill faded.\n\nBefore the final floor vote, state Rep. Matt Willhite looked up to the gallery where Linda Benoway was watching. Willhite told her he was sorry.\n\nBenoway's son Stevie LaDue, 55, died by suicide in September. Before his retirement after 30 years as a Tampa firefighter, he tried to get workers' comp because of PTSD. When the state denied his claim, he had to go back to work and pay back the time he missed.\n\n\"Why I say I'm sorry to you is because the system failed you, and prior to today, we failed you,\" Willhite said. \"Your son, this may have saved his life.\"\n\nAfter Willhite spoke, the bill passed unanimously.\n\nThe bill also comes too late for Josh Vandegrift, a firefighter and paramedic in the city of Cocoa.\n\nVandegrift was just starting a 24-hour shift in July 2016 when the call came in: A pedestrian had been hit by a vehicle about 100 yards from his station.\n\nVandegrift and other firefighter paramedics responded by ambulance, and Vandegrift cleared bystanders out of the way.\n\n\"I looked down and I saw my brother's face on the patient,\" he said.\n\nNate Vandegrift, his younger brother, had been hit by a commercial van crossing the street. Josh Vandegrift began to treat his brother before being removed from the scene by police officers. \"I remember just absolutely losing it in the middle of the road.\"\n\nNate Vandegrift died about eight hours after the accident. Since then, Josh Vandegrift has had nightmares and flashbacks. He avoids the intersection if possible.\n\nDoctors diagnosed Vandegrift with PTSD. He took his sick time and vacation time, and when that ran out, co-workers donated their sick time to him. When that ran out in August 2016, he applied for workers' compensation. His claim was denied.\n\n\"I had to go back to work or resign, basically,\" said Vandegrift, who returned to work. \"I have good days, and I have really bad days, and everything in between. Every day, I walk through a different part of hell and have to figure out how to navigate it.\"\n\nVandegrift, one of dozens of first responders who have answered WMFE and ProPublica's request to hear from first responders suffering from PTSD, won't benefit from the new law. The legislation will cover people who make a workers' comp claim after Oct. 1, 2018, as long as the triggering event was within the prior year.\n\nThat means Parkland first responders could be covered, but not Vandegrift and responders to the Pulse nightclub shooting. Vandegrift said he knew before he started advocating for the law that it likely wouldn't apply to him.\n\n\"If anything happens in the future, something is in place now so nobody will have to go through what I went through,\" Vandegrift said. \"You know, to be able to get out of bed in the morning.\"\n\nWMFE and ProPublica are investigating PTSD and suicides in first responders as part of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network.

Every so often, NPR Host/Special Correspondent Michele Norris will dip into those six-word stories to explore issues surrounding race and cultural identity for Morning Edition.\n\n\"You've Got to Be Carefully Taught\". Those six words form the title of a song from Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein's South Pacific, the wildly popular musical revolving around cross-cultural love affairs in the South Pacific during World War II.\n\nThat phrase \u2014 \"You've got to be carefully taught\" \u2014 is also a popular entry in The Race Card Project's inbox. More than a dozen people have offered submissions quoting those six words in some way.\n\nLet's begin with a little context. The musical South Pacific, which opened on Broadway in 1949, won several Tony Awards the following year. Then, years later, it became a hit movie.\n\nTo say South Pacific was successful would be an understatement \u2014 it was a blockbuster. But it also drew critics and controversy. It covered uncomfortable territory. Its romantic tension was based on interracial romance, a strong taboo at the time.\n\nEven so, the soundtrack topped the charts. Songs like \"Some Enchanted Evening\" and \"I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair\" were in heavy rotation on the radio and on record players around the country.\n\nAnd judging from the inbox at The Race Card Project, the message behind the song \"You've Got to Be Carefully Taught\" has resonated with those who love the South Pacific soundtrack, like Kathleen Ziegler of Lino Lakes, Minn. She says she first heard that song on her family's record player.\n\n\"I had three older sisters,\" she says. \"We used to put the records on a lot, as we were cleaning, especially. And we'd have it turned way up and we learned all the songs.\"\n\nThe sisters would sing together, Ziegler says, and the lyrics to \"You've Got to Be Taught\" stay with her, even today.\n\nYou've got to be taught\n\nTo hate and fear, you've got to be taught from year to year\n\nIt's got to be drummed in your dear little ear\n\nYou've got to be carefully taught.\n\nYou've got to be taught\n\nTo be afraid of people\n\nWhose eyes are oddly made\n\nAnd people whose skin is a different shade\n\nYou've got to be carefully taught.\n\n\"I just remember hearing [the lyrics] when I was young, and it made me very sad,\" Ziegler says. \"I had parents who did exceptionally love us and taught us to do the same. And I just thought, how can people be taught to hate, especially children?\"\n\nZiegler was raised by parents of German descent during World War II. She remembers that the patriotism of that time was also steeped in bias.\n\n\"One of my earliest memories is knowing that you were supposed to hate 'Japs.' We used to say, 'Bombs over Tokyo,' and drop something on the ground,\" she says. \"I never thought of it as being a hateful thing \u2014 then.\"\n\nBut those are words she would never say today, Ziegler says. \"No, no. That's offensive. [But] that was what we were taught. Or, what we heard.\"\n\nSeveral people have referenced \"You've Got to Be Carefully Taught\" in their six-word submissions to The Race Card Project. Follow the links below to learn more about why, decades after its release, the song still resonates with each of them. Claire Rosenbaum, Cumberland, R.I. Katherine Roskam, Charlotte, N.C. Leigh Slater, Hagerstown, Md. You can't be friends with her \u2013 Rosie W., Tucson, Ariz.\n\nLove Stories With A Cultural Twist\n\nWhat people hear and see in South Pacific are classic love stories with a thorny cultural twist. What happens, for instance, when \"boy meets girl\" becomes \"all-American boy meets Asian girl in wartime setting\"?\n\nPerhaps Oscar Hammerstein was challenging the democratic principles at stake in World War II. In 1958, Hammerstein was on The Mike Wallace Interview, hosted by Mike Wallace of 60 Minutes fame. \"South Pacific had two love stories in it,\" Hammerstein told Wallace. \"They both concern, in a different way, race prejudice.\"\n\nIn the interview, Hammerstein explained that one of the love stories involves a plucky American woman named Nellie Forbush.\n\n\"Nellie Forbush, the Navy nurse, is in love with a Frenchman, and when she finds out that he was once married to a Polynesian woman and has two Polynesian \u2014 no, half-Polynesian \u2014 children, she runs away,\" he explained.\n\n\"She's shocked by it, and she's awakened later when she fears he's dead, and then suddenly she realizes how unimportant was her prejudice, how important it was that she loved him and how much she wants him back, no matter what kind of children he has,\" he said.\n\n\"What we were saying was that ... all this prejudice that we have is something that fades away in the face of something that's really important,\" Hammerstein told Wallace.\n\nSo, love wins ... sometimes. Because the other love story, Hammerstein explained, \"is about a young Marine who falls in love with a Tonkinese girl on the island.\"\n\nWell \u2014 spoiler alert: Despite the burning desire between Lt. Cable and the island girl, named Liat, their differences keep them apart.\n\nA Deliberate Message?\n\nAt the time of South Pacific's release, its theme of racial and romantic tolerance was just too much for some. Some members of the military complained that \"Carefully Taught\" ruined the flow of the musical.\n\nWhen the show went on national tour in the 1950s, two Georgia state lawmakers were repulsed after seeing it, and said a song justifying marriage between races was offensive. One of them, Rep. David C. Jones, wrote in a letter, \"We in the South are a proud and progressive people. Half-breeds cannot be proud.\"\n\nScholars suspect that Hammerstein knew he would strike a nerve with South Pacific. He had tucked liberal messages into previous productions.\n\nLarry Maslon, a Broadway historian who teaches at the graduate acting program at New York University, says he has always thought of Oscar Hammerstein as a preacher, \"In the way that I think of Abraham Lincoln as a preacher, or Leonard Bernstein as a preacher. Lincoln used the White House, Bernstein used the conductor's podium, and Oscar used the theater,\" he says.\n\n\"And all of his shows offer a kind of benign choice, it seems to me: that tolerance is probably better than prejudice; that enlightenment is probably better than ignorance,\" he says. \"And I think he appealed, in the way that Lincoln did, actually, in his second inaugural address, to the better angels of our nature.\"\n\nNearly 70 years ago, Hammerstein's message of tolerance was largely about race and romance. But on so many levels \u2014 race, sexual orientation, class, religion, gender \u2014 the challenge of reaching across differences is still relevant today.", "keywords": ["south", "race", "carefully", "taught", "love", "youve", "hammerstein", "words", "intolerance", "used", "pacific"], "polarity": 0.11669696969696969, "subjectivity": 0.5028549783549786},

Six other shots hit him from behind and one in the thigh. The Sacramento Police Department has said Clark was shot at 20 times.\n\nSacramento Police initially said \"officers believed the suspect [Clark] was pointing a firearm at them.\"\n\n\"Prior to the shooting, the involved officers saw the suspect facing them, advance forward with his arms extended, and holding an object in his hands,\" Sacramento Police said in a release a few days after the shooting. \"At the time of the shooting, the officers believed the suspect was pointing a firearm at them. After an exhaustive search, scene investigators did not locate any firearms. The only items found near the suspect was a cell phone.\"\n\nIn a statement after the press conference, the Police Department said further comment would be \"inappropriate at this time\" because the official coroner's report had not been released. Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg echoed the department's call to wait for official results and that he knew the details would be \"graphic and disturbing.\"\n\nOmalu, who is best-known for his brain injury research pointed at diagrams of Clark's wounds as he spoke.\n\nSeven of the bullets each \"possessed a fatal capacity,\" Omalu said.\n\nDeath was \"not instantaneous,\" Omalu said, adding that his results suggest Clark lived for three to 10 minutes before he died.

Board of Education of Topeka has died. Linda Brown was just a kid when her father tried to enroll her in a white elementary school. And a promise he made to her in 1951 led to a transformative U.S. Supreme Court decision three years later. Here's Frank Morris from member station KCUR.\n\nFRANK MORRIS, BYLINE: In the early 1950s, Linda Brown was a kid growing up in a racially mixed Topeka neighborhood just four blocks from Sumner Elementary School.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nLINDA BROWN: But when school time came, I would have to take this school bus and go clear across town. And then the white children that I played with in the neighborhood, they would go to this other school. And my parents tried to explain this to me, but I was too young at that time to understand.\n\nMORRIS: This is Brown speaking to NPR in 1973. Her mom, Leola Brown, told NPR that she and her husband Oliver Brown were faced with explaining racism and segregation to their perplexed little girl.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nLEOLA BROWN: But her daddy told her that he was going to try to his best to do something about it and see that that was done away with.\n\nMORRIS: After making this profound promise, Brown walked his daughter to the neighborhood school and tried to enroll her. The principal told him it couldn't be done.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nLEOLA BROWN: He came back home, and he was very disgusted. And together, he and the NAACP started a suit against the Board of Education.\n\nMORRIS: It was 1951. Junior and senior high schools in Topeka were already integrated.\n\nJANAI NELSON: The final frontier in desegregating public schools was at the elementary school level.\n\nMORRIS: Janai Nelson is with the NAACP's Legal Defense and Education Fund.\n\nNELSON: I think everyone knew that once we removed the barriers of segregation from public schools, from children, that that would forever change the course of how Americans interacted with one another, how they viewed each other, how they perceived the humanity of each other.\n\nMORRIS: Three years later, the case was before the U.S. Supreme Court combined with four others from around the country all lumped together under Brown's name.\n\nNELSON: Out of that, the name Brown, the surname Brown became synonymous with notions of equality.\n\nMORRIS: After the landmark ruling and the death of her father, Linda Brown moved back to Topeka, worked in early childhood education, traveled, promoting civil rights and played the piano in the church where her father had preached.\n\nCAROLYN WIMS-CAMPBELL: She was my sister in Christ.\n\nMORRIS: Carolyn Wims-Campbell knew Linda Brown nearly all of her life and not just as the face of desegregation.\n\nWIMS-CAMPBELL: She just wasn't that cute little girl.

Several polls taken this year show that a bare majority of Americans want to see stricter gun control. A CBS News poll in April showed that 54 percent of adults nationwide want gun laws to be stricter, 33 percent want them left as they are, and 11 percent would like less strict gun laws.\n\nStephen Colbert and James Corden opened their shows on CBS in a similar vein as Kimmel.\n\nCBS/The Late Show With Stephen Colbert YouTube\n\nColbert called for action by Congress on gun control. \"If we are facing pure evil, then by all means offer thoughts and prayers. But think about what you need to do, and then pray for the courage to do it,\" he said.\n\nThe British-born Corden called Sunday's massacre \"the biggest mass shooting in United States history. That's a record that's been set twice since the two-and-a-half years that I've been living in America.\" The 2016 massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando had previously been the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.\n\nCBS/The Late Late Show with James Corden YouTube\n\nCorden cited statistics that 11,660 people have been killed by gun violence in the past 275 days in the U.S., which is noted in running statistics kept by the Gun Violence Archive.\n\n\"Now I come from a place where we don't have shootings at this frequency so it's hard for me to fathom, but it should be hard for everyone to fathom,\" Corden continued. \"Gun violence should not be a staple of American life. Some say it's too early to talk about gun control. For those victims last night, it's far too late.\"\n\nKimmel, who last week forcefully spoke out against GOP efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, said he wants his to be a comedy show. \"I hate talking about stuff like this,\" he said. \"I just want to, you know, laugh about things every night, but it seems to increasingly difficult lately. It feels like someone has opened a window into hell.\"", "keywords": ["night", "jimmy", "massacre", "gun", "late", "socalled", "shooting", "watch", "leaders", "slams", "kimmel", "mass", "violence", "corden", "control"], "polarity": -0.061514210427253906, "subjectivity": 0.4010869565217391},

Six other shots hit him from behind and one in the thigh. The Sacramento Police Department has said Clark was shot at 20 times.\n\nSacramento Police initially said \"officers believed the suspect [Clark] was pointing a firearm at them.\"\n\n\"Prior to the shooting, the involved officers saw the suspect facing them, advance forward with his arms extended, and holding an object in his hands,\" Sacramento Police said in a release a few days after the shooting. \"At the time of the shooting, the officers believed the suspect was pointing a firearm at them. After an exhaustive search, scene investigators did not locate any firearms. The only items found near the suspect was a cell phone.\"\n\nIn a statement after the press conference, the Police Department said further comment would be \"inappropriate at this time\" because the official coroner's report had not been released. Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg echoed the department's call to wait for official results and that he knew the details would be \"graphic and disturbing.\"\n\nOmalu, who is best-known for his brain injury research pointed at diagrams of Clark's wounds as he spoke.\n\nSeven of the bullets each \"possessed a fatal capacity,\" Omalu said.\n\nDeath was \"not instantaneous,\" Omalu said, adding that his results suggest Clark lived for three to 10 minutes before he died. One question hanging over the case is whether officers got him medical attention quickly enough to be saved.\n\nIt's unclear whether the wounds into his back occurred while he was upright or on the ground.\n\nThe official coroner's autopsy has not yet been released and may take weeks to put together.\n\nYouTube\n\nFuneral services for Clark were held Thursday and attended by the city's mayor and the Rev.

The hotel developers \u2014 including a little-known company called Bayrock Group \u2014 suddenly owned an American historic site.\n\nChurch archivist David Pultz says Bayrock officials stalled DNA testing for years. \"My suspicion was they were trying to avoid controversy\" that might bring more scrutiny, he said.\n\nEmbedded Trump Stories: Trump SoHo Trump Stories: Trump SoHo Listen \u00b7 43:18 43:18\n\nA hotel behind veils\n\nIn fact, at Trump SoHo, a lot remains unknown, including the project's true source of funding.\n\nBut now the man whose name brands the hotel \u2014 Donald Trump \u2014 lives in the White House. And his financial ties reportedly are being investigated by Department of Justice special counsel Robert Mueller in connection with a larger probe into possible ties between Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and Russian officials.\n\nNote this: In a lawsuit, Bayrock's former finance director Jody Kriss portrays the firm as a money-laundering operation, used to conceal transfers of illicit funds and disguise them as legitimate real estate transactions. He also alleges that cash infusions from overseas were fraudulently portrayed as loans to help the firm's principals evade taxes.\n\n\"Tax evasion and money laundering are the core of Bayrock's business model,\" the lawsuit alleges. And the Trump SoHo building, it said, was \"a monument to spectacularly corrupt money-laundering and tax evasion.\"\n\nBayrock has denied money-laundering allegations; the company's spokeswoman declined to comment for this story. The White House referred all questions about Trump SoHo to the Trump Organization, which did not respond to multiple inquiries.\n\nMueller's team reportedly is specifically looking into money laundering in New York City real estate. That investigation \u2014 along with the discovery process of various lawsuits \u2014 may help uncover information about the business back story of the man whom Americans have elected president.\n\nAnd the NPR podcast Embedded also has been digging around, trying to understand more about one Trump signature project. Here's what the reporters learned.\n\nHow it all started\n\nWith much fanfare, Trump announced the project on his TV show, The Apprentice, in 2006.\n\nThroughout the years, the project kept making news, what with the bones, a heated standoff with the neighborhood and the grisly death of a construction worker. And lawsuits started to hit, alleging fraud and shady financing.\n\nDonald Trump announces Trump SoHo on the Apprentice in 2006. YouTube\n\nThe early zoning battles set the tone: Residential properties weren't allowed in the neighborhood where the property was proposed. Local activists confidently predicted zoning problems would kill the 46-story project. But city officials allowed the building to go up as a condo-hotel hybrid.\n\nUnits were sold like condos, but owners could stay only a few weeks at a time, totaling about four months annually. For Trump, it was a licensing deal: The developer would get use of Trump's name, and Trump would get fees for managing the building. And in a legal deposition, Trump said he also got an 18 percent equity share of the building.\n\nIn a New York magazine article, Trump says the idea for the Trump SoHo was presented to him as \"a complete proposal\" by one of the two developers, Bayrock and the Sapir Organization. The former had been launched several years earlier by two Soviet-born immigrants, Tevfik Arif and Felix Sater. The latter was part of a New York real-estate empire started by Soviet-born financier Tamir Sapir and his son Alex.\n\n\"Only ... cash deals\"\n\nAs it turned out, selling the New York condo-hotel to U.S.-based buyers was tough; the \"non-residential\" designation meant they couldn't qualify for mortgages, says Ruedi Sieber, a broker who at the time worked for a firm selling the Trump SoHo units.\n\n\"You could only do cash deals,\" Sieber said. \"So unless the guy had a million and a half in cash to purchase the property, he couldn't buy it because no bank would give you a loan.\"\n\nIn fact, Trump SoHo sales went a lot better with wealthy buyers in Latin America, Europe and the former Soviet Union. The pitch was simple, Sieber says: You could own a piece of real estate in Manhattan, with views of the Hudson River with five-star service. Trump's Apprentice fame helped.\n\nCondo buyers take SoHo to court\n\nBut then, the Great Recession hit New York real estate hard, and some of the Trump SoHo's condo buyers began getting cold feet. They turned to Manhattan attorney Adam Bailey to try to get back their money.\n\nAs Bailey investigated, he and his team zeroed in on the way the Trump SoHo was marketed as almost sold-out.\n\nIn media interviews, Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr., \"a Trump representative\" and other officials had been saying that 60 percent or \"more than half\" of the building's units were already sold.\n\nBut documents found by Bailey's team indicated the total sold was not quite 16 percent. \"I'm like, 'This is fraud. Done,' \" he said.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nAs Bailey pursued his civil suit, he also sent evidence of possible criminal issues to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.'s office. He says prosecutors there were \"very interested\" and \"started working on it.\"\n\nWith that investigation going on, the developers and Trump \u2014 who has long boasted that he never settles lawsuits \u2014 agreed to settle Bailey's case, refunding the buyers 90 percent of their money and paying legal fees, but without admitting any wrongdoing. Bailey and his clients signed a nondisclosure agreement barring them from discussing any evidence of criminal fraud.\n\nCriminal case goes away\n\nWithout cooperating witnesses, Vance dropped the criminal case. A recent investigative series by WNYC-FM, ProPublica and The New Yorker said some prosecutors in Vance's office wanted to proceed with the case but were blocked by Vance.\n\nThe news stories also indicated that Trump attorney Marc Kasowitz had made two five-figure donations to Vance's campaign in 2012: one that Vance received and soon returned before dropping the case; another one Vance received, and also returned, after the case was already dropped. Vance has publicly insisted he dropped the case only because the evidence was insufficient.\n\nWho funded this project?\n\nIf it had gone forward, the investigation might have provided some answers to questions \u2014 such as, why did Trump, who'd had a string of bankruptcies, suddenly get a generous offer from Bayrock?\n\nIn a legal deposition, Trump once tried to explain it: \"We had a tenant in the building, in Trump Tower, called Bayrock, and Bayrock was interested in getting us into deals and we \u2014 somebody from Bayrock, I'm not exactly sure \u2014came to see \u2014 either myself or one of my children ... about doing this job.\"\n\nThe \"job\" required no investment from Trump, but could potentially funnel millions his way for the use of his gilded brand name. Trump agreed to it: The Trump Organization would collect fees for managing the building, and son Donald Jr. and daughter Ivanka would manage the marketing and sale of its residences.\n\nWhat was Bayrock?\n\nToday, the history of the financing and construction of Trump SoHo is reportedly one of the subjects under investigation by Mueller.\n\nThe SoHo deal may help explain possible financial ties connecting Trump to Russian associates involved with Bayrock, founded by the Soviet-born financier Arif, who acquired a chromium plant in Kazakhstan and became one of the country's wealthiest men.\n\nAt his side was Sater, born in Moscow, raised in Brooklyn and known for a checkered past. In the 1990s, he did time in prison for stabbing a man in the face with a broken glass during a bar fight, and later pleaded guilty in connection with a securities fraud scheme, which allegedly was aided by the Italian Mafia.\n\nBut Sater would also become a valuable cooperating witness for the U.S. government, helping it convict mob figures for financial-fraud crimes and even earning praise from Attorney General Loretta Lynch.\n\nIn various legal depositions involving Bayrock, Sater was usually described as someone whose job was to raise money for the company.\n\nTo build the Trump SoHo, Bayrock would team up with Alex Sapir, the son of billionaire Tamir Sapir, who was born in the Soviet republic of Georgia and grew rich in the fertilizer and oil businesses \u2014 and later in New York real estate deals. (The senior Sapir died in 2014).\n\ntoggle caption Mark Von Holden/WireImage/Getty\n\nToday, much of what's known about Bayrock and its financing comes from various lawsuits filed against the firm. One suit was filed by the former finance director Kriss, who joined the firm around 2001. His suit claims he was owed money by his former company, which he describes as \"spectacularly corrupt,\" running on cash infusions from overseas and dodging taxes. Bayrock and Kriss are currently in settlement talks.\n\nSater did not return requests for comment, and his attorney said the Kriss lawsuit was meritless.\n\nHow much did Trump know?\n\nOn Dec. 17, 2007, the New York Times published an article that detailed Sater's criminal past, as spelled out in a then-sealed criminal complaint. Sater said he was a changed man, telling the Times, \"I am not proud of some of the things that happened in my twenties. I'm proud of the things I am doing now.\"\n\nThe article would raise legal questions for Trump. When a principal at a firm has a felony conviction, investors are supposed to be told about it.\n\nTrump told the Times he knew little about Sater. \"We never knew that,\" he said about the report of Sater's financial crimes. \"We do as much of a background check as we can on the principals. I didn't really know him well,\" he said.\n\nIn 2013, Trump told the BBC, \"We were not the developer there. It was a licensing deal... a very simple licensing deal ... You're telling me things that I don't even know about.\" As the interviewer followed up with more questions, Trump abruptly stood up to leave.\n\nThe BBC's John Sweeney asked Donald Trump about Felix Sater in 2013. YouTube\n\nTrump's effort to portray himself as barely involved with the Trump SoHo has been challenged over the years. \"Donald was always in charge,\" Kriss recently told Bloomberg. \"Donald had to agree to every term of every deal and had to sign off on everything.\"\n\nLikewise, questions have been raised about Trump's claim that he barely knew Sater.\n\nIn a lawsuit deposition in 2007, Sater testified that he knew Trump, and when asked whether he had ever been in Trump's office alone with him, Sater replied, \"numerous times.\"\n\nIn 2010, long after the Times article, Sater was passing out business cards identifying himself as \"a senior adviser to Donald Trump.\" In a 2016 interview with a Russian publication, Sater spoke about being Trump's adviser until about 2011, saying he \"reported everything\" to Trump, \"sometimes twice a day, sometimes twice a week, sometimes twice a month. And like that, for 10 years.\"\n\nIn 2015, Sater sent an email to Trump attorney Michael Cohen boasting of his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin and proposing a new Trump real estate deal to highlight the candidate's negotiating skills, the New York Times reported. \"Our boy can become president of the United States, and we can engineer it,\" Sater wrote.\n\nTo Bloomberg reporter Tim O'Brien, who has written extensively about Trump, Sater's apparent proximity to the president raises important issues.\n\n\"The question that hangs over all this for me is, why is Donald Trump associating with someone like this?\" he asks. \"And why is he still in Trump's orbit after he got elected?\"\n\nSomewhere deep inside the history of Trump SoHo, those answers may still be buried.\n\nNPR's Chris Benderev, Kelly McEvers, Marilyn Geewax, Investigations research librarian Barbara Van Woerkom and Business Desk intern Mollie Simon contributed to this report.", "keywords": ["glass", "mysteries", "hotel", "sater", "hiding", "wrapped", "bayrock", "trumps", "estate", "donald", "shiny", "real", "trump", "york", "soho", "case"], "polarity": 0.009672587066204096, "subjectivity": 0.4216862137074903},

Mary Fallin expressed the state's frustration.\n\n\"We have two clear choices,\" she said. \"We can continue down a path of sliding backwards, or we can choose the second path, which is to say 'Enough is enough! We can do better! We deserve better! Our children deserve better, too!' \"\n\nMany of the tax cuts and subsequent revenue failures have happened on Fallin's watch.

This problem will occur over and over and over again in a commodity-based economy like ours unless we create revenue streams that create stability.\"\n\nBut there's a problem. When you pass a tax cut in the state of Oklahoma, it may as well be permanent. In the early 1990s, in reaction to a tax increase, voters passed a ballot measure requiring 75 percent of the Legislature to vote in favor of any revenue hike.\n\nThis year, that supermajority requirement has given the tiny Democratic minority in Oklahoma the power to derail any plan. And even though the Step Up scheme meets many of their demands, House Minority Leader Steve Kouplen thinks it's just not enough.\n\n\"A drowning man will grab any lifeline, whether it's a good one or not,\" he said. \"One has been thrown to us. We think it needs to be tweaked, and we think some true compromise needs to take place to change it.\"\n\nDemocrats believe oil and gas companies have gotten rich while poor Oklahomans have borne the brunt of the cuts to state services. The Step Up plan, they say, doesn't do enough to protect the poor from paying to fix a mess they didn't make.\n\nRainbolt and the bipartisan business coalition that introduced the compromise plan say the state is in a mess and there is no easy way to fix it. They point to the fact that when they created the plan, business leaders from competing industries sat down at a table to find a solution and everyone had to give.\n\n\"We'd created something that no one in the room liked every part of but that everybody in the room agreed would move us forward.\" Rainbolt said. \"We thought it was saleable to the Legislature, and it appears that it is.\"\n\nOklahoma Rattlesnake Roundup Attracts Thousands Of Spectators \u2014 And Lots Of Criticism Oklahoma Rattlesnake Roundup Attracts Thousands Of Spectators -- And Lots Of Criticism Download \u00b7 4:10 4:10\n\nBut the spirit of compromise hasn't reached lawmakers yet.

It's a slow process, he says; the House chamber didn't even have a women's restroom until a renovation completed in 2007.\n\nThe historic nature of the Virginia Capitol doesn't help.\n\n\"We're cramped for space in this office, to be honest, so having a dedicated room \u2013 everything's sort of spoken for, so we have to kind of retrofit and work around that,\" Nardo says.\n\nFor now, Nardo says two lactation rooms have been set aside in a nearby legislative office building.\n\n\"Having gone through the first session with this many women of child-bearing and \u2013rearing ages, we're working through it,\" Nardo says.\n\nWhile Democrats Tran and Carroll Foy are newcomers, other female lawmakers before them have had to navigate similar challenges, one at a time.\n\nIn 2008, Republican state Sen. Jill Vogel was the first Virginia state lawmaker to have a baby while in office. She remembers slipping away to pump breast milk, then sending it to her office with a Senate page.\n\n\"They had no idea what they were delivering,\" Vogel says with a laugh.\n\nVogel says the work culture around politics has lagged behind the private sector in accommodating working moms. She says she often gets asked how she can be both a mother of six and a legislator \u2013 a question her male colleagues are less likely to face.\n\n\"In a private sector job, you wouldn't think twice; you'd say 'Of course I can do both and be competent at both,'\" she says. \"So I didn't apologize.\"\n\nState Sen. Jennifer McClellan, a Democrat, was a state delegate in 2010 when she had her first child. She asked to borrow an empty office when she needed to pump, and she now offers her own office to staffers, lobbyists, and any other new moms at the Capitol who might need a space to pump.\n\n\"I even made a sign that had a picture of a cow that said, 'Do not enter,'\" McClellan says with a laugh. \"And it was like, you know, don't ask questions when you see that, just don't come in.\"\n\nMcClellan says it's important to accommodate young mothers in politics, in part because of the perspectives they bring to issues like education and childcare.\n\n\"You get a different perspective once you are living that life.\" McClellan says.\n\nIt's a relatively new challenge; women have long been under-represented in elected office. It was just this year that the nation saw 25 percent of state legislative seats held by women.\n\nPolitics Colorado Has A History Of Women In Politics \u2014 And A Harassment Problem Colorado Has A History Of Women In Politics \u2014 And A Harassment Problem Listen \u00b7 4:06 4:06\n\nKatie Ziegler, program manager for the Women's Legislative Network at the National Conference of State Legislatures, says women with children have historically waited to run until later in life.\n\n\"It has been much less common for women to run and serve with infants and toddlers,\" Ziegler says, \"and we've seen that in how few state legislatures and capitol buildings have fully figured out how they will accommodate nursing mothers.\"\n\nZiegle says some capitol buildings are beginning to make accommodations, and more will need to do so as women are elected in greater numbers.\n\nMultiple groups around the country are working to elect more women in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nErin Loos Cutraro founded the nonpartisan group She Should Run, which is now part of a coalition dedicated to electing women of all stripes. She says bringing more women into public life will change both public policy and the workplace culture around politics.\n\n\"It's not terribly surprising that many of these conversations around how to make the governing workspace more welcoming to new moms are, 'That's a new conversation!'\" she says. \"But everything changes when we add women to the equation. We get a stronger democracy. We get stronger policies. And so I think we are absolutely going to have to change the way we do business.\"\n\nThat change includes the U.S. Capitol, where this spring Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., will be the first sitting senator to give birth in office. She says there's no precedent for maternity leave in the Senate, and that her situation illustrates the importance of having a full range of women's experiences reflected in the lives of those who represent them.\n\n\"I'm one person facing this here in the Senate,\" Duckworth told NPR. \"But...there are women all across this country who are facing starting their families and there's no policy for them either \u2013 and they're not United States Senators and get the attention that I'm getting.\"", "keywords": ["state", "office", "ways", "sarah", "baby", "virginia", "women", "accommodate", "run", "capitol", "working", "moms", "statehouses"], "polarity": 0.1410353535353535, "subjectivity": 0.45748367129946077},

Board of Education, a yearlong ProPublica investigation found that many schools across the country are back where they were under Jim Crow segregation: racially isolated and under-resourced.\n\nIn Tuscaloosa, Ala., the story of the Dent family underscores what's happened to schools in that city over the past three generations.\n\nJames Dent, a 64-year-old African-American, described watching the roller coaster of integration in his city \u2014 from segregation to integration and now back to segregation, Norris says.\n\nOther Tuscaloosa Students Share Their Six Words Enlarge this image toggle caption Amanda Zamora/ProPublica Amanda Zamora/ProPublica Sophie Fairbairn On Her Six Words Enlarge this image toggle caption Amanda Zamora/ProPublica Amanda Zamora/ProPublica Ryan Foster On His Six Words toggle caption Amanda Zamora/ProPublica Jazmine Thompson On Her Six Words Enlarge this image toggle caption Amanda Zamora/ProPublica Amanda Zamora/ProPublica James Niller On His Six Words\n\nHis six words for The Race Card Project: \"We went to all-black schools.\"\n\nDent and his wife were part of a generation that saw promise in school integration. And for a time, the local high school, Central High, was a model for integration. Central produced National Merit scholars and winning baseball, football and basketball teams. The school dominated the math championships. Dent's daughter went there and had a great experience.\n\nBut, as ProPublica found, it was hard to maintain that level of integration. First, white families started to peel away. Then, over time, something else happened: \"bright flight.\" Middle-class black families also peeled away from the neighborhood, leaving it not just racially isolated but economically isolated as well.\n\n'A Lot Happens Over Here'\n\nThose shifts had a tremendous impact on Tuscaloosa. Today, schools in the Dents' neighborhood, like Central High, have a white population of less than 1 percent.\n\n\"You see Central getting smaller and smaller,\" James Dent says. \"I don't know why. Central High School is getting smaller and smaller.\"\n\nDent's wife, Beverly, has some opinions as to why. \"A lot happens over here, for one thing,\" she says. \"You know, like shootings, robbery and stuff like that \u2014 that happens over here. Now, it might happen on [the white] side too, but I think it happens over here a lot more than it does over there. And the whites are scared.\"\n\nThere are other schools in the city with more resources than Central. Those schools, like Bryant High, have relatively large white populations. And the larger community views the schools differently, Beverly Dent says.\n\n\"I think Central is not \u2014 what's the word I'm looking for? They look at Central lower than they do Bryant,\" Beverly says. Once upon a time, she says, \"when you went out in the world and said you were from Central, people would say, 'Wow, that's a good school.' ... You got a lot of good people coming out of there, going to college and stuff.\"\n\nBut James Dent's granddaughter, D'Leisha Dent, has had a different experience. She's about to graduate from Central High, and has her own six words for The Race Card Project: \"Segregation should not determine our future.\"\n\nThe 17-year-old is very proud of her school, with its large brick building just a stone's throw from the University of Alabama.\n\nBut as the neighborhood changed, the school changed. D'Leisha says she's especially aware of that when she hears her mother, Melissa Dent, talk about Central High's heyday \u2014 during that brief period when it was integrated. Melissa had friends of all races, including people she still keeps in touch with today.\n\nBut things are different for D'Leisha.\n\n'I'm Gonna Stay On It'\n\n\"Me and my friends always talk about how we wish the schools were not segregated. And, like, we wish we could interact with more Caucasian people, 'cause they seem fun,\" D'Leisha says. \"I don't really know how they are outside of school, but I wish we could have interacted with more people.\"\n\nAnd the community, D'Leisha says, doesn't \"expect much\" from Central students. \"They have low expectations from us. ... It's just some people \u2014 they expect low. They don't expect anything from Central High School.\"\n\nBut D'Leisha has her own inner compass, Norris says. And like so many other high school kids right now, D'Leisha runs to the mailbox every day looking for a college admission letter.\n\n\"I do what I have to do,\" D'Leisha says. \"I'm in honors class, AP \u2014 advanced placement \u2014 and don't settle for less.

Could having a Grammy-winning artist pillory your brand for being racist actually be beneficial?\n\nAs the old adage goes, \"All press is good press.\"\n\nIn 2014, Adweek looked at a study that suggested negative headlines \u2014 for instance, several media outlets reporting that a rap star accused a brand of being subtly racist \u2014 have a 63 percent higher click-through rate than positive ones.\n\nA recent study from the Pew Research Center found that nearly a quarter of Americans are on Twitter and that more than two-thirds are on Facebook.\n\nThe combination presents a useful overlap for a brand, even if it is the subject of negative attention \u2014 if a \"controversy\" is stoked on Twitter, and news outlets are posting their articles about that controversy to Facebook, it's reasonable to assume a large audience would be scooped into paying attention to it, relative to the one an ad could have hoped for in the first place. As a 2014 working paper from Harvard Business School titled, \"The Rising Cost of Consumer Attention.\" put it: \"Before consumers can be affected by advertising messages, they need to first be paying attention.\"\n\nIt later poses the question: \"How can brands create ads so compelling that consumers actively seek them out?\"\n\nChance's tweet, and media coverage of it, presents one way. Remember: Fyre Festival, that doomed experiment in entrepreneurial and excess hubris, began as nothing more than an expensive social media marketing campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, the fuzzy practice of translating the value of people seeing your advertisement versus reading about your company through an article, what is called \"advertising value equivalency,\" is not particularly well-regarded by professionals and has largely fallen out of favor as a metric, according to the Public Relations Society of America. Moreover, advertising value equivalency relies on an outdated equation that depended on comparing the total square inches a brand would receive in a physical magazine and then extrapolating its value based on the advertising rates for that publication.\n\nThe sweet spot, regardless, would be media coverage of a brand's advertisement \u2014 just as Chance pointed out.\n\nThere are recent-ish examples of a similar situation. Last fall, a soap brand was forced to express, like Heineken, its \"regret\" over a racially insensitive ad showing a black person washing her skin and revealing it to be white. A year ago, Pepsi's grandiose ad featuring Kendall Jenner was so laughably out-of-touch that its rollout was halted, all but forcing Saturday Night Live to parody it. And on Wednesday, an egregious example from Groupon was added to the pile.\n\nYouTube\n\nIn a media landscape with only one common denominator \u2014 fragmentation \u2014 getting people's shattered attention spans to focus on one place for any amount of time is a win. Even if that win is achieved by failing.\n\n\"In truth, it might not matter whether they 'meant; to do this or not, when the outcome is the same,\" writes Ian Bogost, an editor at The Atlantic and a media studies professor, in an email to NPR Music. \"The commercial probably had a much greater effect even though it was technically pulled than it might have had otherwise.\"\n\nBogost had similar thoughts around Pepsi's own experience with failing upwards last year.\n\n\"It's a trap: Let the ad lie and risk its seemingly racist message to continue,\" Bogost says, \"or draw attention to it and spread the marketing message far further than it would have reached. There's no good move.\"\n\n\"I didnt wanna tweet about it so bad ... but its like how can u not,\" Chance wrote.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Heineken stock was up \u2014 that isn't proof that it was positively impacted by the controversy, but it certainly shows it wasn't hurt by it.

Police said at the time they believed it was a gun.\n\n\"They didn't have to kill him like that. They didn't have to shoot him that many times,\" she sobbed, as Clark's uncle, Kurtis Gordon, wiped tears from her face.\n\n\"Why didn't you shoot him in the arm? Shoot him in the leg? Send the dogs?

But a young black man holding a cellphone is shot 20 times,\" he said. \"Young man who was bombing homes in Austin, [Texas], the police followed him for hours. He wasn't shot once.

She also added, \"The Sacramento County District Attorney's Office reviews all officer-involved shootings that occur in the county which result in injury or death.\"\n\nActivists and protesters have been demonstrating in the days since footage of the killing was released last week.

And if he doesn't, let me know, and I'll attack him.\"\n\nThose are the words of (now) President Trump, but they're not from any current controversy. They're from 2009, from an interview in the ESPN documentary Small Potatoes: Who Killed The USFL?, which aired that same year. Trump is talking about Charley Steiner, the longtime ESPN sportscaster who's now the play-by-play radio announcer for the Los Angeles Dodgers. In the 1980s, Steiner was the announcer for the New Jersey Generals, the football team Trump had bought that was part of the upstart USFL, a professional football league that lasted three seasons playing in the spring instead of, like the NFL, in the fall.\n\nThe words come shortly after filmmaker Mike Tollin tells Trump something that Steiner said regarding his purchase of the Generals in 1983, in the league's second year: \"[Trump] figured that he could buy his way onto the back page of the New York Post, he could move to Page Six, the gossip page, and then ultimately, the front page. Donald Trump was no longer a Donald, but the Donald.\"\n\nAs you know, the part about making it to the front page eventually came true, though Steiner probably wouldn't have predicted how.\n\nSmall Potatoes, which is available to rent on streaming services, provides some interesting additional context \u2014 along with his flirtation with buying the Buffalo Bills shortly before his 2016 presidential campaign began \u2014 for Trump's recent condemnation of NFL players who kneel during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racial inequality. Trump has gone so far as to proclaim via Twitter that owners should prohibit these protests and should fire anyone who engages in them. It's worth remembering that his history with the NFL is long. (So, in fact, is his history with ESPN, which made this documentary he greatly disliked, and with whom he also got into it recently over ESPN commentator Jemele Hill calling him a white supremacist.)\n\nTollin's thesis in Small Potatoes \u2014 which later earned him a public feud over the film with Trump that did take place on Page Six \u2014 is that the USFL was killed by Trump's stubborn insistence on the doomed idea of moving USFL football to the fall to compete directly with the NFL. Players interviewed for the film, including stars like Jim Kelly and Steve Young, say they had a feeling the push to the fall was a bad idea. The USFL was small but growing. Why throw yourself against the incredibly powerful NFL? But Trump didn't want to coexist as a smaller league and wait to see what happened. He went after a bigger prize.\n\nTrump became the public face of a lawsuit against the NFL by the USFL in 1986, arguing that the NFL constituted a monopoly that, among other things, prevented the USFL from getting fall television contracts. Ultimately, the jury believed that the monopoly existed, but not that the USFL had been damaged by it in the way it claimed. It awarded the USFL $3. One possible explanation for the lack of damages? The NFL had argued that the USFL had planned not to actually play separately in the fall, but to force the NFL to merge with it and adopt at least some of its teams. That could mean the USFL wasn't really harmed by not getting TV contracts it never intended to get.\n\nThe verdict was for $3 plus interest, actually \u2014 a check for $3.76 that Tollin has on hand and gives to Trump during the prickly 2009 interview. The tiny verdict \u2014 the arguably empty victory \u2014 quickly led to the USFL folding altogether.\n\nBecause political lenses can be so disorienting, it can be worthwhile to look back at documents from before politics really dominated a person's image. Here, Tollin makes an argument in 2009 that Trump was impatient and overeager for a confrontation with the NFL. And no less a figure of the 1980s than Burt Reynolds, who was also involved with the league, says in an interview that Trump's \"dream was to be in the National Football League. And they didn't want him.\"\n\nThat's not the way Trump sees the story or his interest in the league, and he's steadfast in his arguments to Tollin that he was right, that spring football was never going to be a success. What would have happened if the league had stayed in the spring and tried to grow gradually is speculation, for both men.\n\nAt the end of the 2009 interview with Tollin, while taking off his microphone, Trump asks Tollin whether he agrees or disagrees with Trump's thinking about what the league should have done. Tollin suggests that he thinks the league could have carried on for a while playing in the spring, had it continued as it was. \"It would have been small potatoes,\" Trump says, patting Tollin on the shoulder. \"Have a good time.\"\n\nThe documentary \"Small Potatoes: Who Killed the USFL?\" can be found as an episode within Volume 1 of ESPN's series 30 For 30, which is available to rent on platforms including iTunes, Amazon and Google Play.", "keywords": ["usfl", "potatoes", "page", "nfl", "trumps", "donald", "tollin", "small", "long", "league", "trump", "football"], "polarity": 0.033650629673356955, "subjectivity": 0.373974321133412},

It is the inspiration for round after round of baseless speculation about the cause of his death, linking it to the leak of thousands of Democratic Party emails that year. And those theories are generating yet another lawsuit.\n\nThis week, Aaron Rich, Seth Rich's brother, sued Dallas financial adviser Ed Butowsky, a pivotal figure in early coverage of the case, along with a conservative conspiracy theorist and the The Washington Times. The suit alleges that the trio promoted groundless accusations about Aaron Rich's involvement in the leaks of those emails to Wikileaks.\n\nThere is no publicly known factual basis for making those accusations. U.S. intelligence and national security officials under both the Obama and Trump administrations concluded that hackers acting at the behest of the Russian government had illegally hacked the Democratic National Committee emails.\n\nAaron Rich's lawsuit is the third related to politically motivated conspiracy theories about Seth Rich's death filed against Butowsky, a sometime Fox News contributor.\n\nThe claims about Seth Rich were the core of a Fox News story last May \u2014 retracted a week later and the subject of a lawsuit filed by Rich's parents against Fox News filed earlier this year. Butowsky had allegedly been a key figure in orchestrating that story, according to material contained in a lawsuit filed last August against Fox News, Butowsky and a Fox News reporter stemming from that same discredited Fox News story. (Fox News said the story had not been subjected to sufficiently rigorous editing and scrutiny but did not apologize to the Riches.)\n\nAaron Rich's attorneys point to additional public statements from Butowsky and an online conservative activist named Matt Couch (along with Couch's company, America First Media) that they claim strongly imply Aaron Rich engineered the mechanics of getting the Democratic Party emails to WikiLeaks and that he accepted money from the shadowy outfit.\n\n\"Aaron wants to clear his name,\" Rich's attorney, Michael Gottlieb, told NPR. \"The accusation is that he's conspired with a hostile foreign intelligence service to steal documents from an American political organization in exchange for money. ... It's completely and utterly fabricated and baseless.\"\n\nAs a candidate, President Trump hailed Wikileaks for publicizing the Democratic emails, which showed dissension within the Democratic Party over Hillary Clinton's primary battle with Bernie Sanders. Trump's CIA chief, Mike Pompeo, has called WikiLeaks a hostile intelligence service.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, filed this week in federal court in Washington D.C., Aaron Rich holds security clearance for the work he does for a defense contractor. Gottlieb says his client views the accusation of helping WikiLeaks as tantamount to an accusation of treason.\n\nIn commenting on the lawsuit, Butowsky told NPR he was merely repeating what Rich's parents told him about Aaron Rich during his first call to the couple, back in December 2016. Butowsky claims that Joel Rich said he knew his sons had been involved in downloading those documents for WikiLeaks in exchange for payment \u2014 a contention that a spokesman for Aaron Rich's family and his attorneys heatedly deny.\n\nOn March 18, The Washington Times published an opinion piece by a retired commander in chief of the Pacific fleet, James A. Lyons, titled, \"More Cover Up Questions.\" It linked Seth Rich's death to the leaked emails and cited Butowsky as a source. (Lyons and Butowsky had served together on an unofficial \"citizens' commission\" on the deadly attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, a touchstone for conservative critics of the Obama administration.)\n\nSenior executives at The Washington Times did not return NPR's calls seeking comment.\n\nThe lawsuit documents what it says is coordination between Butowsky and Couch; it presents evidence that Butowsky is seen weighing in during one of Couch's live streaming Periscope video commentaries to say that WikiLeaks payments to Aaron Rich were \"confirmed\" by his parents.\n\nIn remarks this week to NPR, Butowsky affirmed the exchange. He told NPR it was the only public online discussion he had with Couch.\n\nButowsky further distanced himself from Couch in speaking to NPR: \"I don't really know Matt at all. I have talked to him from time to time,\" Butowsky said. \"But I don't really know what's credible or who's credible.\" He pointed back to what he alleged are the December 2016 remarks from Aaron Rich's parents (which they reject).\n\nButowsky told NPR that he is currently representing himself in the case because, he said, he considered it ridiculous.\n\nIn another Periscope streaming video posted after the lawsuit was filed, Matt Couch said he would not be deterred in his search for the truth.

Right Call?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption April Dembosky/KQED April Dembosky/KQED\n\nFour months after having her second baby, Jessica Porten started feeling really irritable. Little things would annoy her, like her glider chair.\n\n\"It had started to squeak,\" she says. \"And so when I'm sitting there rocking the baby and it's squeaking, I would just get so angry at that stupid chair.\"\n\nShe read online that irritability could be a symptom of postpartum depression \u2014 a condition that affects up to 1 in 7 women during or after pregnancy, according to the American Psychological Association. In California, where Porten lives, those rates are even higher, spurring state lawmakers to introduce a package of bills to improve mental health screening and treatment for new moms.\n\nPorten hopes they help women avoid what she went through.\n\nShe went to Capital OB/GYN, a women's clinic in Sacramento that accepts her Medicaid coverage as payment, to talk about medication options and therapy. Porten admitted to the nurse that she was having some violent thoughts.\n\n\"I described maybe hitting myself or squeezing the baby too tight,\" she says. \"But I was very adamant through the entire appointment that I was not going to hurt myself and I was not going to hurt my children.\"\n\nBut, Porten says, the nurse's manner toward her changed. \"I could see in that moment that she stopped listening to me,\" Porten says.\n\nThe nurse called the police. The police escorted Porten and her baby to the emergency room. Hospital staff made her change into a gown and took her purse, but they let her keep her diaper bag for the baby. They put them both in a room, under constant watch, though the hospital staff was sympathetic, Porten says.\n\n\"It's like, everybody knows I'm not crazy,\" she says. \"Everybody knows that this is normal \u2014 but they're following protocol.\"\n\nFinally, at midnight, 10 hours after she first got to the doctor's office, a social worker sent her home. Porten wrote on Facebook that the whole thing made her feel like a criminal.\n\n\"It was all legality,\" Porten says. \"Everybody was protecting their own liability instead of thinking of me.\"\n\nAdministrators at Capital OB/GYN declined to comment. Gary Zavoral, a spokesman for Sutter Health, which runs the emergency room where Porten was taken, says that once a patient arrives in the ER for assessment, hospital staff must follow strict protocols.\n\n\"The process is to make sure everybody is safe: the individual's safe, the family's safe, the staff is safe,\" he says. \"The process does take some hours, so 10 hours is not unusual.\"\n\nWhen patients reference violent thoughts, it forces doctors to think about things in a different way, says Dr. Melanie Thomas, a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco and Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital.\n\nCalifornia law allows doctors to involuntarily confine a person with a mental disorder if they are a danger to themselves or others. But Thomas says what constitutes imminent danger can be vague.\n\n\"You can imagine a provider, a social worker, any number of people might interpret that phrase in different ways, about what is necessary to report and what isn't,\" she says.\n\nThe laws and medical protocols don't always line up, Thomas says. There have been times she felt asked to rely on legal reasoning over her clinical judgment.\n\n\"The fragmented aspects of our system of care make it difficult to get women the help that they really want,\" Thomas says.\n\nThat is one reason lawmakers in Sacramento are now introducing a package of bills to specifically address maternal mental health. Assemblyman Brian Maienschein, R-San Diego, is backing two of them. One would require doctors to screen new moms for depression; under current law, it's voluntary.\n\n\"The numbers here are so significant that I think it's something that doctors really should understand and should be prepared to both diagnose and treat,\" he says. Screening, he adds, also \"educates a woman in that situation that this is an issue that may impact her.\"\n\nMaienschein's other bill would direct the state to tap into a new federal pot of money set aside for postpartum programs and awareness campaigns. It was established under the 21 Century Cures Act, which was passed in the final months of the Obama administration.\n\n\"Getting federal money is a great thing,\" Maienschein says. \"It's federal money that's available that I'd like to see California have, versus another state.\"\n\nThe legislation has given Jessica Porten a new purpose. People have told her that she should sue Capital OB/GYN for calling the police. But she says no.\n\n\"I walk into that waiting room and I see tons of Medi-Cal recipients \u2014 so they're all low-income,\" she says. \"If I sue, it's only going to cause monetary damages to a facility that is clearly short on resources.\"\n\nInstead, Porten says she'll advocate to get the new bills passed in California. She thinks that is the way to help the clinic's physicians and nurses do a better job of helping new moms get the care they need.\n\n\"I'm not going to take that away,\" she says. \"I'm going to build it up.\"\n\nThis story is part of NPR's reporting partnership with KQED and Kaiser Health News.", "keywords": ["room", "woman", "porten", "going", "postpartum", "help", "baby", "thomas", "seeks", "staff", "health", "nurse", "depression", "safe", "doctors", "calls", "cops", "right"], "polarity": 0.06265308616115067, "subjectivity": 0.5237514546385512},

We can do better! We deserve better! Our children deserve better, too!' \"\n\nMany of the tax cuts and subsequent revenue failures have happened on Fallin's watch.

This problem will occur over and over and over again in a commodity-based economy like ours unless we create revenue streams that create stability.\"\n\nBut there's a problem. When you pass a tax cut in the state of Oklahoma, it may as well be permanent. In the early 1990s, in reaction to a tax increase, voters passed a ballot measure requiring 75 percent of the Legislature to vote in favor of any revenue hike.\n\nThis year, that supermajority requirement has given the tiny Democratic minority in Oklahoma the power to derail any plan. And even though the Step Up scheme meets many of their demands, House Minority Leader Steve Kouplen thinks it's just not enough.\n\n\"A drowning man will grab any lifeline, whether it's a good one or not,\" he said. \"One has been thrown to us. We think it needs to be tweaked, and we think some true compromise needs to take place to change it.\"\n\nDemocrats believe oil and gas companies have gotten rich while poor Oklahomans have borne the brunt of the cuts to state services. The Step Up plan, they say, doesn't do enough to protect the poor from paying to fix a mess they didn't make.\n\nRainbolt and the bipartisan business coalition that introduced the compromise plan say the state is in a mess and there is no easy way to fix it. They point to the fact that when they created the plan, business leaders from competing industries sat down at a table to find a solution and everyone had to give.\n\n\"We'd created something that no one in the room liked every part of but that everybody in the room agreed would move us forward.\" Rainbolt said. \"We thought it was saleable to the Legislature, and it appears that it is.\"\n\nOklahoma Rattlesnake Roundup Attracts Thousands Of Spectators \u2014 And Lots Of Criticism Oklahoma Rattlesnake Roundup Attracts Thousands Of Spectators -- And Lots Of Criticism Download \u00b7 4:10 4:10\n\nBut the spirit of compromise hasn't reached lawmakers yet.

Every so often, NPR Host/Special Correspondent Michele Norris will dip into those six-word stories to explore issues surrounding race and cultural identity for Morning Edition.\n\nThe Oscar-nominated film 12 Years a Slave packs an emotional wallop. It's based on the memoir of a real person, Solomon Northup, a free black man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the 1840s. The movie depicts the brutality of the slave system by telling the story of a man who endured it.\n\nThe Race Card Project has seen an uptick in six-word submissions about slavery since the film's release \u2014 particularly from people who have grappled with their own family connections to slavery.\n\nProject curator Michele Norris and Morning Edition's Steve Inskeep both spoke with John Ridley, screenwriter of 12 Years a Slave (and an occasional commentator on Morning Edition), about what he hopes audiences will take away from the film.\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn how the film has sparked very personal conversations about the nation's history of slavery\n\nWe have to remember, when Solomon wrote his memoir, at that time, this was a best-seller. It became a linchpin in the abolitionist cause. He toured, he spoke. And the story fell into obscurity. And we're having these conversations now, and what people are walking away from this film and this story with is that \u2014 and, by the way, I put myself ... at the head of this list \u2014 is how we really didn't have any concept of what slavery was all about.\n\nSo, I'm not surprised that many people would walk away from this film feeling like they need now to have a true concept or a true conversation about these kinds of things. I'm just sort of shocked that it's taken us this long to really try to excavate what slavery was all about.\n\nOn how he hopes the film will compel exchanges about slavery that aren't mired in guilt or anger\n\nI think what cannot get lost in this is where we've come as a country. And I think there has to be a sense of pride that we have come this far. There's got to be pride for the individuals whose families survived all of this. I think there's got to be pride for those individuals who [can say], \"If my family was like this, I am not.\" ...\n\nMy father was out here in California at [a school \"grandparents' day\"]. ... And a woman from Virginia came up to my dad ... and she said to him, \"Oh, your name is Ridley? ... I used to have family in Virginia named Ridley.\"\n\nAnd my dad just said very casually ... \"Oh, well, you know what, your family, they probably owned our family. They may have. I have family from Virginia.\" And the woman was not shocked, she was not taken aback. She goes, \"Oh, you know what? That's very possible.\" They started researching together, firing letters back and forth, looking to find out if that was true.\n\nI think it's very important for people to not go into it going, \"Oh, if my family did that 160 years ago, that's me.\" As opposed to, \"Why don't we find out what happened? Why don't we find out how we got to a point now where our kids or our grandkids are in the same school, enjoying the same privileges, that we are citizens in the same country and can actually talk about this as opposed to being afraid or horrified about what happened?\"\n\nWhat happened, happened; we can't change that. But we can change who we are in this moment. That's how you move on from this.\n\nOn how he was struck by Solomon Northup and his story\n\n[He was] a man who used every part of himself to survive \u2014 his wits, his guile, his physicality \u2014 but never gave into bitterness, never gave up his faith in other people and the system that completely let him down.\n\nI have two boys. I just said, if I were trying to show these two boys, my two sons, what I thought the character of a man was \u2014 of an American man, of a man of color \u2014 that's what Solomon was when I read this book. And my message was just about character.\n\nOn the importance of a scene in which a slave owner forces Solomon to beat a fellow slave\n\nMost importantly \u2014 and with almost everything that you'll see in the film \u2014 it was that way in the memoir. It was exceptionally important to me to hew as closely as possible to what was happening in the book.\n\nAnd also ... it speaks to the mindset of the slave owner ... played by Michael Fassbender. It would have been very easy ... going to a 2013 mindset, to simply say, \"Well, these individuals are all purely evil, and blacks across the board were just purely saints, and that was it.\" And that scene in particular really spoke to the multifaceted nature of that environment, and what it did to individuals across the board.", "keywords": ["film", "12", "inspires", "slave", "man", "think", "family", "true", "conversations", "slavery", "solomon", "thats"], "polarity": 0.08403604497354498, "subjectivity": 0.5293964947089946},

But what do the players get? Supposedly, a free education. It's a perennial debate. Should we pay student athletes? But let's look at this debate through another lens. Those student athletes, particularly the ones on the best teams - many of them are black. But the coaches who train them, the schools they attend, the audience who watches - mostly white. It's a dynamic that raises all sorts of questions about big-time college sports, race and fairness. NPR's Gene Demby and the Code Switch team tackled this in a recent podcast. And he's come on the program to talk about it. Welcome.\n\nGENE DEMBY, BYLINE: Hey, Lulu.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So, Gene, let's start by looking at the money involved in big-time college sports. You looked specifically at the Power Five.\n\nDEMBY: Yup, the Power Five conferences - the SEC, the Big Ten, the Big 12, the Pac-12, and the ACC. They win all the trophies, and they make all the money. According to ESPN, in 2015, they made $6 billion.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Six billion?\n\nDEMBY: Billion with a B. And they have their own cable channels. I mean, they're major sports players. And almost all that revenue comes from two sports, men's basketball and football.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So where does all of that money go?\n\nDEMBY: Not to the student athletes. Under NCAA rules, they're amateurs. They cannot be compensated beyond their scholarships and the cost of attending college. But it goes to coaches' salaries. It goes to facilities. It goes to the conference commissioners who all make an excess of $2 million now. There are a lot of people who are millionaires because of these sports. And so everyone gets paid except for the student athletes.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So how does race factor into all of this?\n\nDEMBY: I mean, race is all throughout this conversation in the way people think about it and who the actual players are literally in this case. So Shaun Harper, who is a scholar on diversity in higher education at USC, said that, you know, many of the schools in the Power Five were either officially or effectively segregated for most of their histories. And that has really tangible consequences for the way campus life looks. And so these are conceived as white spaces. Their fan bases are white. Their alumni bases are white. Their cultural spaces are white. And so black students will be players in football and basketball. They'll be on the court and the field but they won't be in the stands.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So you're saying black people will be players. What do those demographics look like?\n\nDEMBY: So most of the players in the money sports, in football and basketball at the Power Five schools, are black. So 56 percent of the basketball players - men's basketball players - are black. Fifty-five percent of the football players are black. But 2.4 percent of the students at these schools are black men. And so this is -\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Only?\n\nDEMBY: Only 2.4 percent. I know. That was shocking to us, too. But there's this weird paradox that happens, right? So you have black men on these campuses who are basically invisible in the classrooms. But at any given time and during any given academic year, the most high-profile undergraduate at one of these universities is likely to be a black basketball phenom or a black football star.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: What did you find out about if these stars are actually getting the education that they've been promised?\n\nDEMBY: So Shaun Harper, the diversity expert from USC we were just talking about, crunched these numbers. And he found that at the Power Five schools, almost half of the black students in these two revenue-generating sports are not graduating from college. You'd almost be - you'd be better off actually being a black male student who was not on one of these teams. And that's important because the NCAA and supporters of not paying these athletes often talk about - that student athletes are more likely to graduate from college. And that might be true for some students, but it's not true for black male athletes.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So why? What's keeping them from graduating?\n\nDEMBY: We've talked to a bunch of people who talked about how hard being a student athlete is. People are dedicating 40 to 50 hours a week officially, you know, to being student athletes, to going to practice, to training. And then after they've done all those things, they have to go to class. They have to still be students. And, you know, they're often shuttered into classes that are maybe not the majors they want to be because those classes don't align with when their football and basketball schedules are. And so they're not graduating from college, and part of that is because the incentive structure is set up for the schools to value them as athletes before they value them as students.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So, obviously, there is divided opinions about whether or not student athletes should be paid. Do we know anything about how these opinions break down?\n\nDEMBY: Most Americans do not want to pay student athletes, but there is a big racial split. Sixty percent of white people are opposed to paying student athletes. That's according to The Washington Post and ABC News poll from last fall - while a small majority, about 54 percent of African-Americans, want them to be paid.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Have there been any studies looking at why certain groups are responding in certain ways?\n\nDEMBY: So there was a study done last year by some researchers at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst that looked at whether racial resentment was informing how people answer this question. And they found that the strongest indicator for opposition to compensating student athletes among white people - the strongest indicator was racial resentment towards African Americans. And there's a way that these sports are racialized because the most high-profile college athletes in these sports are black players.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Gene Demby, the lead blogger of NPR's Code Switch, thank you so much.\n\nDEMBY: Thank you so much, Lulu.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

Luther Strange, R-Ala., at a campaign rally Friday night, when he used a segue in his speech that was supposed to convince voters that continuing to have Strange in the Senate would make all Alabamans winners \u2014 an argument with emotional appeal in a state known for its fierce love of football.\n\nCNN via YouTube\n\nAnd while he was on the subject of football, Trump took the opportunity to expound on his thoughts regarding NFL players, like Colin Kaepernick, who last year began kneeling during the national anthem in protest over perceived social injustices against African-Americans. Trump's take: It's unpatriotic and NFL team owners should fire those refusing to stand.\n\n\"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now'?\" he said to roaring applause.\n\n\"He's fired!\" Trump said, paraphrasing his popular reality TV catchphrase.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Trump took on Stephen Curry of the NBA champion Golden State Warriors in a tweet. The president rescinded an offer for what has become a traditional celebratory visit to the White House for any championship team of a major professional sport.\n\nHe wrote: \"Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team. Stephen Curry is hesitating, therefore invitation is withdrawn!\"\n\nThe president was reacting to Curry's statement Friday that the popular star player didn't want to visit the White House and meet with Trump because Curry believed that passing on the traditional event would send the message that \"we won't stand for\" some of Trump's past remarks. \"This is my opportunity to voice that,\" Curry also said, of the possibility of not going to the White House as expected.\n\nSaturday afternoon, Trump was back online attacking the NFL.\n\n\"If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL, or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU'RE FIRED. Find something else to do!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nWhile none of Trump's tweets or remarks were explicitly about race, they led to an escalating war of words between the president and black athletes, activists and celebrities on social media. And the president, who was almost immediately cast as being divisive, took a serious pummeling from NFL team owners and notable black public figures.\n\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement Saturday morning, \"Divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL, our great game and all of our players.\"\n\nLate Friday night, before Trump had sparked controversy involving Curry, Max Garcia of the Denver Broncos couldn't help comparing Trump's comments about kneeling in the NFL during the campaign rally with how he responded to events in Charlottesville, Va., last month that left one counterprotester dead.\n\n\"What an emphatic response, where was this passion in response to Charlottesville...\" Garcia wrote on Twitter with a video of Trump.\n\nIndividual NFL teams, including the New York Giants, Miami Dolphins, Green Bay Packers and San Francisco 49ers all issued statements Saturday condemning Trump's remarks.\n\nJed York, CEO of the San Francisco 49ers, for whom Kaepernick played last year when he began the kneeling protest, issued this statement:\n\n\"The callous and offensive comments made by the President are contradictory to what this great country stands for. Our players have exercised their rights as United States citizens in order to spark conversation and action to address social injustice.\"\n\nDolphins owner Stephen Ross said, \"Our country needs unifying leadership right now, not more divisiveness. We need to seek to understand each other and have civil discourse instead of condemnation and sound bites.\"\n\nMeanwhile, current and former luminaries in the NBA weighed in online Saturday expressing support for Curry and criticizing Trump.\n\nBasketball megastar LeBron James, who has nearly as many followers on Twitter (38.4 million) as Trump does on his personal account (39 million), defended Curry, his sometimes rival on the court.\n\nJames wrote, \"U bum @StephenCurry30 already said he ain't going! So therefore ain't no invite. Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up!\"\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon, James' tweet has been liked more than a 1.1 million times and retweeted more than a half million times. According to Twitter, the message is James' most retweeted post to date.\n\nJames later recorded and posted a two-minute video to Twitter in which he said, \"It's not about dividing. We as American people need to come together even stronger.\"\n\nChris Paul, who plays for the Houston Rockets and is president of the NBA Players Association, questioned the president's attention to the issue in the first place. \"With everything that's going on in our country, why are YOU focused on who's kneeling and visiting the White House??? #StayInYoLane,\" Paul wrote on Twitter.\n\nRetired longtime Los Angeles Laker Kobe Bryant contributed this to the online conversation, suggesting Trump was not living up to his ubiquitous campaign slogan: \"A #POTUS whose name alone creates division and anger. Whose words inspire dissension and hatred can't possibly 'Make America Great Again.' \"\n\nBy Saturday afternoon, the Warriors formally announced they were not visiting the White House \u2014 or Trump. \"We accept that President Trump has made it clear that we are not invited,\" the team said in a statement.\n\n\"In lieu of a visit to the White House,\" the NBA champions added, \"we have decided that we'll constructively use our trip to the nation's capital in February to celebrate equality, diversity and inclusion \u2014 the values we embrace as an organization.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ben Margot/AP Ben Margot/AP\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver said he was \"disappointed\" the team would not be visiting the White House. Curry, for his part, suggested Trump's effort to target him was beneath the dignity of the presidency.\n\nThe dual controversies also elicited reaction Saturday from black celebrities including musician John Legend, actor Jesse Williams and filmmaker Ava DuVernay, among others.\n\nSome politicians also joined the fray on Twitter.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., took a jab at Trump for comments he has made in the past ridiculing Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., for being of prisoner of war. \"And if a person wants the privilege of serving as President, they shouldn't be allowed to disrespect military heroes who were taken prisoner,\" Schiff tweeted.\n\nCalifornia's lieutenant governor and former San Francisco mayor, Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, congratulated the Warriors for the stance. \"Couldn't be more proud of the @warriors. Thank you for speaking truth to power and standing up for our fundamental California values,\" he wrote.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., a frequent critic of the country's growing divisiveness, suggested that if the kneeling protest spread, NFL players would be playing into Trump's hands: \"btw, Trump wants you to kneel\u2014because it divides the nation, with him and the flag on the same side. Don't give him the attention he wants,\" Sasse tweeted.\n\nSeemingly answering Sasse, Trump backers argued that the president's comments have nothing to do with race and are purely about patriotism and respect for the flag.\n\n\"Has our world turned upside down! Our President criticized for believing our flag & anthem should be respected & honored #StandForTheFlag,\" Ronna Romney, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, wrote on Twitter.\n\nFormer Trump campaign aide Corey Lewandowski expressed similar sentiments on Fox News Saturday.\n\nSome in the Washington press corps wrote Saturday that the president is deliberately using coded language to appeal to his base of white voters who see themselves as part of an aggrieved group in America, rapidly losing power and influence relative to ethnic and racial minorities.\n\n\"To address a largely white crowd as 'people like yourselves,' and refer to protesting athletes, often African American, as 'those people,' does nothing to heal the wounds of Charlottesville,\" political journalist Mike Allen wrote on Axios.com Saturday morning.\n\nRon Brownstein, another seasoned political journalist in D.C., spent most of the day on Twitter putting forth the argument that exploiting racial and economic anxieties and divisions was one of Trump's key political strategies.\n\n\"Point of this fight is not very hard to find- more signaling to white racial resentment, which has been central to Trump message from day 1,\" Brownstein tweeted.\n\nBrownstein reaffirmed his point in a later tweet when another journalist questioned whether Trump was utilizing any strategy at all. \"Yes, pretty clearly from day 1: to appeal to parts of older, blue-collar, non-urban white America most uneasy about demographic & eco change,\" Brownstein wrote.\n\nAnother journalist was more blunt. \"There is an unmistakable racial element at play, since he is targeting prominent black players,\" CNN media reporter Brian Stelter wrote Saturday afternoon about Trump's NFL comments.\n\nAnd Stelter's CNN colleague Chris Cillizza saw something similar, writing Saturday that the context of Trump's criticisms was inherently racial given that both the NBA and NFL have mostly white team owners and mostly black players. Cillizza went on to point out that Trump's comments Friday and Saturday bore two rhetorical hallmarks that went back to his presidential campaign: using racially coded language and espousing a seemingly simplistic view of the black community.\n\nMeanwhile, throughout most of Saturday, the hashtag #TakeAKnee trended on Twitter across the U.S., as people sympathetic to Kaepernick wondered about what NFL players would do Sunday and as they talked about posting photos of themselves kneeling in solidarity.\n\nOn Saturday night, the Kaepernick-style protest spread to professional baseball.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Eric Risberg/AP Eric Risberg/AP\n\nCatcher Bruce Maxwell of the Oakland A's took a knee during the national anthem before a game Saturday night in California. Like the rest of his team, Maxwell had his hand on his heart and was facing the flag; as Maxwell knelt, a teammate is shown in photos with a comforting hand on Maxwell's shoulder.\n\n\"This now has gone from just a BlackLives Matter topic to just complete inequality of any man or woman that wants to stand for Their rights!\" Maxwell posted on Twitter on Saturday.", "keywords": ["race", "twitter", "culture", "nfl", "professional", "controversies", "white", "trumps", "president", "embroiled", "curry", "team", "wrote", "trump", "house"], "polarity": 0.08997817066846914, "subjectivity": 0.3346258426482307},

She spoke to Fresh Air in 2017.\n\nDAVID BIANCULLI, HOST:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm David Bianculli, in for Terry Gross. Our next guest today was part of President Obama's inner circle at the White House, but she isn't famous. In fact, in 2011, she was included on the New Republic's list of \"Washington's Most Powerful, Least Famous People.\" But now her name is becoming better known because of her best-selling memoir about working in the White House. Her name is Alyssa Mastromonaco, and her book, which is now out in paperback, is called, \"Who Thought This Was A Good Idea?\" It's not an expose.\n\nIt's about what it takes to make things work at the White House and how stressful the process is. Mastromonaco was assistant to the president and director of scheduling and advance at the White House from 2009 to 2011, and then served for three more years at the White House as assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff for operations. She's now an executive at A&E Networks. Terry spoke with her last year.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nTERRY GROSS, BYLINE: Alyssa Mastromonaco, welcome to FRESH AIR. So when President Obama came to the White House and you came with him, you were working on events. And you said - you know, and you had to, like, create and schedule events - that the Secret Service was especially unwilling to do anything remotely risky because President Obama was the first African-American president. Can you talk about some of the things surrounding that, surrounding what I imagine is all the threats against him?\n\nBecause in addition to it being, like, an incredibly divisive atmosphere, as the first African-American president, there was so much racism that was being directed at him overtly or covertly. So how did that affect his ability to events and what it took to schedule, you know, events for him?\n\nALYSSA MASTROMONACO: So a couple of things. A lot of people, of course, compared us to President Clinton and how President Clinton got out more and he did these sort of sweeping, beautiful events on the, like, at the Grand Canyon when he would sign bills. And what people didn't realize is not only, you know, was Barack Obama the first African-American president, he was a post-9/11 president, which is a totally different beast. And also, it was the first presidency that was completely within the age of social media.\n\nSo when people talk about the uptick of threats that the Secret Service would report, so much of that was because of the advent of Facebook and Twitter. It was easier to make the threats for people to count, right? And so when we were first getting started, none of us wanted to ever put anyone, you know, at unnecessary risk. I don't think anybody would want to do that. But for us, there were a lot of grand ideas that people had. One of them was having him do an event on the Triborough Bridge. And I knew that there was no way on earth that the Secret Service was going to allow that.\n\nBut I think even now with President Trump, they wouldn't allow that because it's just such a different world. Technology is so different. You can detonate a bomb with a cell phone. We know that now. Even on the rope line with President Obama, when people would hold up their iPads or their iPhones to take a picture, Secret Service always asked them to put it down because they can be, you know, a device.\n\nGROSS: So another thing that you had to do as deputy chief of staff is work with agencies like the Department of Defense to run classified construction projects and maintain the continuity of government exercises, exercises so that if there's a nuclear attack or if Washington floods or the president is incapacitated, everyone knows what to do.\n\nMASTROMONACO: Exactly.\n\nGROSS: Just mentally, emotionally, what was it like for you to be in charge of planning for the absolute worst?\n\nMASTROMONACO: Oddly, it was actually very reassuring when you sit down with the folks who, again, from administration to administration keep this process alive and have this information. You know, you sit down, and they brief you. And you're like, oh, wow, if something happens, actually everybody does know what to do. And so I found it - on the one hand, it's very heady. You're like, I can't believe that I'm seeing what would happen if a nuclear missile was launched from X and how long it would take to get here and what happens.\n\nBut it is comforting to see that these processes are pretty well socialized. Everybody knows them. You know, the 25th Amendment has been one of the funnier things that happens is you obviously notify the speaker of the House and the majority leader, minority leaders in Congress. And we realized that the - when we actually ran the exercise that all of the fax numbers were wrong because people didn't really use faxes anymore. So that was - we're like, oh, we should get new fax numbers.\n\nGROSS: Can you tell us what your role was supposed to be in case of the worst, like, where you would be and what your job would be?\n\nMASTROMONACO: If - I can't really talk about what my job would be - but in both - in a scenario of the president being incapacitated, say, he needed to have surgery, I sort of ran the process, the many steps of the 25th Amendment and sort of bringing that to life. And then the - in, like, worst case scenario, if the president had to go some place, I would have been part of the crew that was evacuated with him.\n\nGROSS: What was the closest you got to having to enact one of those plans?\n\nMASTROMONACO: Goodness. Oh, I would say it was when the president had his colonoscopy.\n\nGROSS: Wow. If that was the worst (laughter).\n\nMASTROMONACO: Knock wood - yes, that is the worst I remember.\n\nGROSS: So you were preparing for, like, say it really doesn't go well...\n\nMASTROMONACO: Yes.\n\nGROSS: ...Or just for that period when he's incapacitated...\n\nMASTROMONACO: Just that period when he's...\n\nGROSS: ...Because he's under a light sedative.\n\nMASTROMONACO: Exactly. And we figured this is a great time for us to, you know, go through all of the steps, and it was an interesting exercise.\n\nGROSS: Right. OK.\n\nMASTROMONACO: You feel very - you feel like you're in the, you know, \"The West Wing\" television show in those kind of - in those scenarios.\n\nGROSS: So what did you have to do to get the president in and out of Iraq or Afghanistan which were, you know, war zones? And what is the secret service and weaponry like when you fly with the president into a war zone?\n\nMASTROMONACO: You know, it's - there's a lot of it. You know, you have the counterassault team, of course. And usually when you're working with, you know, President Karzai's team, they're pretty - I mean, nobody wants anything to happen to the president when he's coming to take a visit because that reflects so poorly. I mean, President Karzai wants people to believe that, you know, Afghanistan is not that dangerous. And so, you know, having anything bad happen to the president of the United States when he's there would be quite bad.\n\nSo they were usually pretty helpful. I mean, not always as helpful to me because I was a woman, and so sometimes they would make me sit out in the courtyard when all the guys went inside. But the Secret Service - and they were always quite protective of me. Like, they understood that in a lot of these places, people were a bit hostile towards me.\n\nBut no, I mean, Secret Service acted - of course it's heightened, you know, when you're going someplace that is - that can be that volatile. But for the most part, they were always at a 10 out of 10 on the preparedness scale.\n\nGROSS: Is this the kind of thing that happened to you a lot when you were traveling abroad to Muslim countries where you were shut out in some way?\n\nMASTROMONACO: You know, not really, to be honest. When we went to - I'm trying to think. Most places were quite open. They know that you are an American and that you're a diplomat in this capacity. And so they're quite generous and sort of fluid, I guess, in these situations. And one person had told us when we went to - it was customary for King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia to not shake women's hands. And that when you got off the plane and went through the receiving line that you basically should keep your hands down by your sides and just say nice to meet you and keep going.\n\nAnd so you line up in precedence order, right? So it's like, you know, the chief of staff would be first, you know, followed by the senior advisers and then me and the national security adviser. So when we were getting off the plane in Saudi Arabia, Valerie Jarrett and I, who traveled together a lot, she and I knew, like, keep your hands down and just keep going. But King Abdullah put his hand out to us. And I was petrified. It's like, I didn't want to cause an international incident and shake his hand when I wasn't supposed to. But he had his hand out, and President Obama was standing there and he's like, shake his hand.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nMASTROMONACO: So we did. And so for that - you know, mostly it was just that there weren't a lot of women in general around, not that they didn't really let us be there. Like, we were always welcome. We were just usually - Valerie and I were among the only two women sometimes in lunches of 30 people.\n\nBIANCULLI: Alyssa Mastromonaco, speaking to Terry Gross last year. More after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PRINCE SONG, \"ALPHABET ST.\")\n\nBIANCULLI: This is FRESH AIR. Let's return to Terry's 2017 interview with Alyssa Mastromonaco. Her memoir about working in the inner circle at the White House titled \"Who Thought This Was A Good Idea?\" is now out in paperback.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nGROSS: So tell us about Air Force One.\n\nMASTROMONACO: Air Force One and the White House medical office are the two things that you miss the most when you leave. People talk about, you know, oh, Alyssa, like, uptown problems, you always flew on Air Force One. I said, yeah, but now I have no frequent flyer miles anywhere so I don't get upgraded.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nMASTROMONACO: So it's doubly hard. But no, it is - I will tell you that - and it's one of these things that when I watch the Trump folks, I just don't know if they feel the same way that we did. But getting on Air Force One for the first time was the most humbling, awe-inspiring - you know, you are trying to be an adult - right? - but you're literally a kid in a candy shop. You're like, can I take a tour? Can I go up and see where all the equipment is? It is a lot like you see on TV.\n\nAnd what people don't totally know, we would fly - President Obama liked to be very efficient with his time. So many, many trips, we would leave Washington at night, fly overnight and then land in country the next morning around 8 o'clock and start our day. And people wouldn't understand there aren't, like, beds for us on Air Force One. We had those, like, Snuggies that you buy on QVC. And we would sleep on the floor. And the best part of becoming deputy chief, especially when Valerie Jarrett didn't travel, is that I could claim the couch. There was one couch that you could sleep on. And then you'd get up. And then you get ready and you have your breakfast. And you go down and you start your day.\n\nAnd there is nothing like walking off the steps of Air Force One. Every single time, you always feel so proud. And the reception too of other people in countries when they see that beautiful, like, blue and white plane, it's just - it always gives you goose bumps.\n\nGROSS: You had to sleep on the floor?\n\nMASTROMONACO: Yeah. We would sleep on the floor. The seats didn't recline all the way, so they could be really uncomfortable. And so we would - a lot of us would sleep on the floor.\n\nGROSS: Wow.\n\nMASTROMONACO: See, it's not that glamorous.\n\nGROSS: No, really. So - and now you have to fly coach? (Laughter).\n\nMASTROMONACO: I do.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) What a comedown.\n\nMASTROMONACO: It's a real bummer when you're in, like, boarding group D.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) So what was the worst fiasco that you were involved with? This is assuming there was a fiasco.\n\nMASTROMONACO: Well, this one's sort of funny. It wasn't quite a fiasco but there was this period of time, I think it was in 2011, when that Icelandic volcano erupted and caused that plume that sort of circled the globe and was quite dangerous for planes because if you flew through the plume, it would melt the engines and the plane would crash. And so we had several trips at that time that were scheduled, foreign trips.\n\nOne was - you'll recall I think it was the president of Poland was killed in a plane crash. And the funeral was happening, and we couldn't go because of the plume. But then a couple of weeks later, we had to go to Asia. And we were in - I think we were in Indonesia. And we were at a summit. And I got a report from the military aid that the plume was coming dangerously close, and that if we didn't take off in, like, the next two hours, we were going to be stuck in Jakarta.\n\nAnd so I got on the phone with the millaid (ph) and the captain for Air Force One. And the first time President Obama met Colonel Turner, he said, that's exactly what I want my pilot to look like 'cause he looked like a total bad ass with his buzzed hair and he was really tough. But I found Colonel Turner. I said, you know, what are we going to do? We have to get out of here. We can't be stuck in Jakarta. And he said, well, the best thing for us to do is be number one in line for takeoff. And he said, but the Chinese are pulling their plane - they're taxing the plane out.\n\nAnd so I sort of had to make this decision. And I told him to cut the Chinese off and pull out Air Force One and get us first in line for takeoff. And we had to hurry to the plane. And the president was like - and all of the military folks on the plane were like, oh, this is great, we're taking off. You know, we could have been stuck here for three days. And the president's like, well, what do you mean?\n\nThey're like, well, if we hadn't been the first in line to take off, we would probably be stuck. We couldn't get back to the U.S. And he said, well, how did we get first in line for takeoff? And they said Alyssa told us to cut off the Chinese. And he looked at me like I could potentially have done something very bad but at the same time was very glad because we all wanted to go home.\n\nGROSS: This could have started a conflict with the Chinese (laughter) because of American arrogance.\n\nMASTROMONACO: Exactly. But it worked out OK. We got home plume-free. But that plume wreaked havoc for months.\n\nGROSS: Well, it's a huge responsibility to, you know...\n\nMASTROMONACO: Yes.\n\nGROSS: You can't be flying with the president if it's dangerous and the plane might go down, right? I mean, that...\n\nMASTROMONACO: That would really be bad.\n\nGROSS: ...Would be bad. (Laughter) Yeah, that would be bad.\n\nMASTROMONACO: That would really be bad because as he would remind us, if that ever happened, it would be President Barack Obama and several unnamed staffers.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nMASTROMONACO: We were like, we know, we know.\n\nGROSS: So one of your legacies - I underscore the importance of this, you know where I'm going (laughter).\n\nMASTROMONACO: I know. Go there.\n\nGROSS: I'm going. You had a tampon machine installed in one of the ladies' rooms. And apparently there aren't many of them in the White House.\n\nMASTROMONACO: Yes. The White House, the West Wing, does not have as many bathrooms as I think any of us would have hoped. And the women's bathroom downstairs, which was near my first office, I think it was three stalls. And all you ever wanted was a tampon. And there just weren't any. And so we would all have - all of the ladies sort of had a code that was like, you know, the tampons are in the upper right drawer of my desk, help yourself. But sometimes everybody would be out. And then inevitably, it was on someone's assistant - usually mine, both of them were men - to go to CVS, which is sort of a pain to go to in the middle of the day, and pick something up.\n\nAnd so when I became deputy chief, I was in the bathroom one day in desperate need and didn't have one. And one of the people who reported to me, Katie Keel (ph), was the assistant to the president for office and administration. She oversaw all of the White House personnel and the campus. And I said Katie, is there any reason we can't have a tampon machine in the West, you know, ground floor bathroom? And she said, I don't think so.\n\nAnd so she went. Two weeks later, we had one. And one, it's great that we were able to do that. But the real point of the story is that you should always ask for - I think for years and years, people assumed there was some reason it couldn't be there and it just took me asking to make it happen. It's not like - I wasn't really breaking ground there. I think I just asked a question.\n\nGROSS: Is there, like, an engraved placard next to it?\n\nMASTROMONACO: No, there isn't, which is why I felt a need to write about it so I could hog all the credit in my book.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) Right. So I thought this was really interesting. You had to get national security clearance for your job.\n\nMASTROMONACO: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: One of the questions you had to answer was a kind of detailed list of your drug use. And you'd smoked marijuana.\n\nMASTROMONACO: Yes.\n\nGROSS: You had to say how many times (laughter).\n\nMASTROMONACO: Yes. That was...\n\nGROSS: Yeah. So you handled it by saying unknown. How did you come to the conclusion that that would be your answer, an unknown number of times?\n\nMASTROMONACO: Because - well, because I really feel strongly about not lying. And so when the FBI agent asked me for a number of times and she said, you know, 20? And I was like, no. She said, a hundred? I said, no. And then when she got up to 500, I was like, I'm not saying - I'm not giving you a number because who knows if they're going to go try and prove the number? So I just said, unknown. And apparently from her reaction, nobody had ever said that before.\n\nGROSS: You write that you had to get randomly drug tested almost every month. Is that because you'd said unknown or does everybody have to do that?\n\nMASTROMONACO: No. Most people get drug tested, like, once or twice that first year. But I was drug tested quite often because I was very forward-leaning about my drug use, very open-kimono, as we would say. And so, yeah, every - just about every month, you'd get an email that said, you know, you have 24 hours to show up for your test. And I would. And it was fine because I wasn't. So I had nothing to hide (laughter).\n\nGROSS: OK. It's been great to talk with you. Thank you so much.\n\nMASTROMONACO: Thank you so much. I loved it.\n\nBIANCULLI: Alyssa Mastromonaco speaking to Terry Gross last year.

{"title": "FACT CHECK: Is Chicago Proof That Gun Laws Don't Work?", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2017/10/05/555580598/fact-check-is-chicago-proof-that-gun-laws-don-t-work", "text": "FACT CHECK: Is Chicago Proof That Gun Laws Don't Work?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nIn the wake of the horrific shooting in Las Vegas this week, the White House faced questions about whether President Trump would support stricter gun legislation.\n\nPress secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders didn't give a definite response to these questions, but her statement showed a White House hesitant to create new regulations.\n\n\"I think one of the things we don't want to do is try to create laws that won't stop these types of things from happening,\" Sanders said Monday. \"I think if you look to Chicago where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year they have the strictest gun laws in the country. That certainly hasn't helped there.\"\n\nPointing to Chicago to suggest that gun laws don't work is not a new talking point \u2014 Trump claimed Chicago had \"the toughest gun laws in the United States\" in a 2016 presidential debate; his fellow Republican candidate Chris Christie likewise pointed to Chicago as a place with high crime despite tight gun laws.\n\nAnd the rhetoric goes beyond politicians. The right-wing site Breitbart has on many occasions posted articles with headlines containing the phrase \"gun-controlled Chicago.\"\n\nThis can sound like a potent talking point \u2014 it is a huge city with a notorious crime problem, which Trump already used regularly to talk about creating law and order. It also packs the added rhetorical punch of being closely linked to President Obama, whose actions Trump has worked hard to undo.\n\nBut while gun violence in Chicago is high, the rest of this common talking point doesn't really hold water.\n\nHigh crime and tough gun laws\n\nIt's also true that there were more than 4,000 shooting victims in Chicago in 2016. It's also true that Chicago has suffered a massive amount of gun crime recently. In 2016, homicides in Chicago sharply rose, mostly as a result of gun homicides, as the University of Chicago crime lab found in a January report.\n\nGun homicides in the city rose by 61 percent between 2015 and 2016. That helped make the gun homicide rate in Chicago particularly huge compared to other similar cities. The rate was 25.1 per 100,000 residents in 2016, compared to 14.7 in Philadelphia and just 2.3 in New York.\n\nIt also had a relatively high number of guns recovered \u2014 243 per 100,000 residents. That's roughly on par with Philadelphia and much higher than Los Angeles or New York.\n\nBut it's not true that Chicago has the toughest gun laws in the country, as other fact checkers have also repeatedly found.\n\nIt is true that Illinois has tougher gun laws than many other states. The state is one of seven that requires licenses or permits to buy any firearm, and it's one of five that requires waiting periods for buying any firearm. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which tracks gun laws nationwide, has given the state a B+ for its gun laws.\n\nChicago itself has some tough laws \u2014 there is an assault-weapons ban in Cook County, for example. But it's not true that Chicago has the strictest gun laws in the country. At one point, it did have much tougher laws \u2014 it had banned handguns in the city limits, but a 2008 Supreme Court ruling declared that ban unconstitutional, and a 2010 ruling reaffirmed that. The city also had had a gun registry program since 1968, but ended it in 2013 when the state passed a law allowing the concealed carry of weapons.\n\n\"We generally think of California as having the strongest gun laws in the country,\" said Hannah Shearer, a staff attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. \"The whole state's laws are pretty strong.\"\n\nThe center has given California an A rating and ranks it No. 1 in terms of the tightness of its gun laws. California bans the open carry of guns and requires background checks on private firearm sales, among other things.\n\n\"Some cities go even beyond that,\" Shearer added. \"San Francisco has a safe storage law, requiring that guns kept in the home are kept locked.\"\n\nThat's a regulation that Chicago, for example, does not have.\n\nQuibbling over exactly what part of the U.S. is No. 1 in terms of gun-law strictness, however, isn't the most compelling part of Sanders' statement. She also said that having gun regulations \"certainly hasn't helped\" in Chicago.\n\nThat's a much more controversial claim \u2014 and it doesn't stand up to scrutiny.\n\nState lines don't stop guns\n\nIt's important to remember here that Chicago is very close to two states that have relatively weak gun laws: Wisconsin and Indiana. So while it's easy to pick on Chicago (or any other high-crime city) for its ugly statistics, says one expert, taking bordering states into account weakens this gun-advocacy talking point.\n\n\"It's not a scientific study. It's an anecdote,\" said Philip Cook, a professor of public policy studies at Duke University. \"They might have pointed to Washington, D.C., back in the days when D.C. banned handguns and yet had high gun-violence rates. Those bans are only at best partially effective, because the borders are permeable.\"\n\nD.C. borders Virginia, which does not have strong gun laws. (It gets a D from the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.)\n\nNeither Wisconsin nor Indiana requires licenses or permits to purchase a gun, for example, nor do they require waiting periods. While Illinois has that B+ rating from the law center, Wisconsin has a C- and Indiana a D-.\n\nAnd there's good evidence that being next-door to those states keeps Chicago criminals well-supplied with guns. A 2015 study of guns in Chicago, co-authored by Cook, found that more than 60 percent of new guns used in Chicago gang-related crimes and 31.6 percent used in non-gang-related crimes between 2009 and 2013 were bought in other states. Indiana was a particularly heavy supplier, providing nearly one-third of the gang guns and nearly one-fifth of the non-gang guns.\n\nOther evidence corroborates this \u2014 a 2014 Chicago Police Department report found that Indiana accounted for 19 percent of all guns recovered by the department between 2009 and 2013.\n\nNew firearms trace data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives released last week likewise shows that Illinois as a whole faces a massive influx of guns. Of around 8,700 firearms recovered in Illinois and for which the bureau found a source state, more than half came from out of state \u2014 1,366, nearly 16 percent, came from Indiana alone.\n\nBy comparison, 82 percent of guns recovered in Indiana and traced were from within Indiana, suggesting that criminals in that state don't have to cross state lines, like those in Illinois, to get their weapons.\n\nAll of this might suggest that criminals will just go to whatever lengths necessary get their hands on guns, regardless of whatever laws are in place.\n\nBut that's the wrong way to think about it, Cook said.\n\n\"No one's in a position to say that Chicago's various special regulations and Illinois's regulations are doing no good,\" he said, \"because we don't know what the homicide rate would be in the absence of those.\n\nSources:\n\n2016 Gun Law State Scorecard.

Compared to those presidential years, midterm meetings like Monday's are lesser-followed but they can point to momentum.\n\nLast night Republicans and Democrats discussed resolutions to their party's platforms and selected delegates for state conventions. They also addressed some issues.\n\nDrake University political scientist Rachel Paine Caufield flags labor rights as something on Democrats' minds. Republicans took control of both chambers of the Iowa legislature in 2016 and stripped many bargaining rights from public sector unions.\n\nShe also suspected moves by lawmakers in the capitol would echo in the meeting rooms across the state as the partisans considered resolutions for their political platforms.\n\n\"Right now we're having legislative debates over transgender rights,\" Paine Caufield said ahead of Monday night's caucuses. \"I think we'll probably see some of that come up.\"\n\nExact attendance numbers are not yet available but Democrats are happy. They say their turnout exceeded 9,000, which they say \"far eclipses\" the 5,000 attendees in 2010 and 6,500 in 2014.\n\nA spokesman for the Iowa Republican Party says they won't release any numbers until later this month. He did stress that these caucuses are strictly party business and not candidate-centric.\n\nRepublican leaders in the state have offered full-throated support for President Trump. Iowa went big for Trump in 2016 after helping Barack Obama to victory in 2008 and 2012.\n\nIn addition to picking delegates (in Iowa, a primary can go to a state convention if no candidate gets 35 percent of the vote) and hearing from candidates themselves (Gov. Kim Reynolds faces a Republican primary challenger and seven Democrats are running for their party's nod), Iowans offered their own ideas.\n\n\"We had a lively a 'drain the swamp' platform,\" says attendee Jess Mazour. She says the conversation in her caucus centered around the idea that once out of office, politicians should not be able to lobby Congress.\n\nBut even at this year's midterm gatherings, the 2020 presidential race wasn't far from mind. Iowans who watched the Super Bowl got a peek at the first official presidential challenger. Rep. John Delaney, D-Md., who's been campaigning in Iowa for months, spent $20,000 for an ad during Sunday's game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the New England Patriots.", "keywords": ["state", "political", "midterm", "democrats", "caucus", "iowa", "rights", "trump", "presidential", "public"], "polarity": 0.17075085833706521, "subjectivity": 0.3955836692043589},

Right Call?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption April Dembosky/KQED April Dembosky/KQED\n\nFour months after having her second baby, Jessica Porten started feeling really irritable. Little things would annoy her, like her glider chair.\n\n\"It had started to squeak,\" she says. \"And so when I'm sitting there rocking the baby and it's squeaking, I would just get so angry at that stupid chair.\"\n\nShe read online that irritability could be a symptom of postpartum depression \u2014 a condition that affects up to 1 in 7 women during or after pregnancy, according to the American Psychological Association. In California, where Porten lives, those rates are even higher, spurring state lawmakers to introduce a package of bills to improve mental health screening and treatment for new moms.\n\nPorten hopes they help women avoid what she went through.\n\nShe went to Capital OB/GYN, a women's clinic in Sacramento that accepts her Medicaid coverage as payment, to talk about medication options and therapy. Porten admitted to the nurse that she was having some violent thoughts.\n\n\"I described maybe hitting myself or squeezing the baby too tight,\" she says. \"But I was very adamant through the entire appointment that I was not going to hurt myself and I was not going to hurt my children.\"\n\nBut, Porten says, the nurse's manner toward her changed. \"I could see in that moment that she stopped listening to me,\" Porten says.\n\nThe nurse called the police. The police escorted Porten and her baby to the emergency room. Hospital staff made her change into a gown and took her purse, but they let her keep her diaper bag for the baby. They put them both in a room, under constant watch, though the hospital staff was sympathetic, Porten says.\n\n\"It's like, everybody knows I'm not crazy,\" she says. \"Everybody knows that this is normal \u2014 but they're following protocol.\"\n\nFinally, at midnight, 10 hours after she first got to the doctor's office, a social worker sent her home. Porten wrote on Facebook that the whole thing made her feel like a criminal.\n\n\"It was all legality,\" Porten says. \"Everybody was protecting their own liability instead of thinking of me.\"\n\nAdministrators at Capital OB/GYN declined to comment. Gary Zavoral, a spokesman for Sutter Health, which runs the emergency room where Porten was taken, says that once a patient arrives in the ER for assessment, hospital staff must follow strict protocols.\n\n\"The process is to make sure everybody is safe: the individual's safe, the family's safe, the staff is safe,\" he says. \"The process does take some hours, so 10 hours is not unusual.\"\n\nWhen patients reference violent thoughts, it forces doctors to think about things in a different way, says Dr. Melanie Thomas, a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco and Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital.\n\nCalifornia law allows doctors to involuntarily confine a person with a mental disorder if they are a danger to themselves or others. But Thomas says what constitutes imminent danger can be vague.\n\n\"You can imagine a provider, a social worker, any number of people might interpret that phrase in different ways, about what is necessary to report and what isn't,\" she says.\n\nThe laws and medical protocols don't always line up, Thomas says. There have been times she felt asked to rely on legal reasoning over her clinical judgment.\n\n\"The fragmented aspects of our system of care make it difficult to get women the help that they really want,\" Thomas says.\n\nThat is one reason lawmakers in Sacramento are now introducing a package of bills to specifically address maternal mental health. Assemblyman Brian Maienschein, R-San Diego, is backing two of them. One would require doctors to screen new moms for depression; under current law, it's voluntary.\n\n\"The numbers here are so significant that I think it's something that doctors really should understand and should be prepared to both diagnose and treat,\" he says. Screening, he adds, also \"educates a woman in that situation that this is an issue that may impact her.\"\n\nMaienschein's other bill would direct the state to tap into a new federal pot of money set aside for postpartum programs and awareness campaigns. It was established under the 21 Century Cures Act, which was passed in the final months of the Obama administration.\n\n\"Getting federal money is a great thing,\" Maienschein says. \"It's federal money that's available that I'd like to see California have, versus another state.\"\n\nThe legislation has given Jessica Porten a new purpose. People have told her that she should sue Capital OB/GYN for calling the police. But she says no.\n\n\"I walk into that waiting room and I see tons of Medi-Cal recipients \u2014 so they're all low-income,\" she says. \"If I sue, it's only going to cause monetary damages to a facility that is clearly short on resources.\"\n\nInstead, Porten says she'll advocate to get the new bills passed in California. She thinks that is the way to help the clinic's physicians and nurses do a better job of helping new moms get the care they need.\n\n\"I'm not going to take that away,\" she says. \"I'm going to build it up.\"\n\nThis story is part of NPR's reporting partnership with KQED and Kaiser Health News.", "keywords": ["room", "woman", "porten", "going", "postpartum", "help", "baby", "thomas", "seeks", "staff", "health", "nurse", "depression", "safe", "doctors", "calls", "cops", "right"], "polarity": 0.06265308616115067, "subjectivity": 0.5237514546385512},

Every so often, NPR Host/Special Correspondent Michele Norris will dip into those six-word stories to explore issues surrounding race and cultural identity for Morning Edition.\n\nKate Byroade lives in Connecticut, but she has a family history that reaches far back to the American South. She always knew her ancestors had once owned slaves, but had been told again and again, particularly by her Southern grandmother, that the family's slaves had been treated well.\n\n\"She was matter-of-fact that the family had owned slaves in the past,\" Byroade says, \"and emphasized that we did not come from 'plantation-type' families \u2014 that our slaves had been trusted house servants.\"\n\n\"At first this seemed OK to me because it was OK to her,\" Byroade continues. \"But eventually I understood that the domination of another person's free will was unacceptable.\"\n\nIn 1844, an 8-year-old girl was purchased at a slave auction. The girl, named Harriet, served as a maid to Byroade's great-great-great-great-great-grandmother. Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Todd Perry Courtesy of Todd Perry\n\nThat realization eventually brought Byroade to her six-word submission to The Race Card Project: \"Slavery's legacy broke my family pride.\"\n\nThe idea of the benevolent slave owner is a common one, and looking past that family lore was just one aspect of Byroade's long personal journey of discovery about race.\n\nThe link between Kate Byroade's ancestors and Harriet, the girl they once owned, was discovered by Byroade's distant cousin, Robert Clegg. He found Harriet's bill of sale and gave it to a library assistant named Todd Perry, one of Harriet's descendants. You can read more about Clegg, Perry and Harriet here.\n\n\"Even going back to her childhood, this is something that she's struggled with,\" Michele Norris tells Morning Edition's Steve Inskeep. \"The things she saw in textbooks or the stories she saw on TV \u2014 shows like the miniseries Roots \u2014 didn't necessarily square with the genteel stories about slavery she heard at the family dinner table.\"\n\nOne childhood incident left a particular psychological mark on Byroade. When she was 10 years old, her class was tasked with an assignment about their immigrant ancestors.\n\n\"And I let drop that my family had owned slaves,\" Byroade recalls. \"The school that I attended was probably about, at the time, 60 or 70 percent African-American. ... And I did not think that I was boasting.\"\n\nOn her way home from school that day, a group of black classmates and their older siblings went looking for her, Byroade says. \"And those children ... decided that they had to chase me, and they had to scream at me, and they had to yell at me.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Shedrick Robinson Courtesy of Shedrick Robinson\n\nThat episode stayed with Byroade, and deepened her interest in trying to understand this historical chasm in America \u2014 something that became even more complicated the more she learned about her own family's history.\n\nA distant cousin discovered that when Byroade's great-great-great-great-great-grandmother arrived in the U.S. from Ireland in the 1800s, a black child immediately was purchased to serve as a handmaiden, Byroade says.\n\n\"And when she discovered that this child had been purchased ... slavery was not just this abstract idea,\" Norris says. \"The history was then attached to a person. It wasn't just an abstraction.\"\n\nThe child's name was Harriet, and she \"was a young child in the Indian Territory, scooped up by outlaws and used to cover a bet on a horse race,\" Byroade says.\n\nByroade takes pride in the fact that she has surrounded herself with all kinds of diversity. She lives in a diverse neighborhood, she attends a diverse church, and her kids belong to diverse Girl Scout troops. But her family pride isn't quite what it once was.\n\n\"I think you can feel pride in the legitimate accomplishments of your ancestors. But I don't think you can feel pride in the fact that they owned slaves,\" Byroade says. \"I don't think you can feel pride that the wealth and prestige was accomplished on the backs of people who were not free, who had no say, who were subject to your whims.\n\n\"We are very shy in this culture about calling out the great wickedness of slavery, and we should not be,\" she says. \"We must not be.\"", "keywords": ["familys", "byroades", "race", "think", "woman", "family", "terms", "slaves", "past", "pride", "owned", "harriet", "byroade", "comes", "slaveowning", "girl"], "polarity": 0.057317073170731724, "subjectivity": 0.39837398373983746},

It's a tribute to Edward Colston, described on a small plaque as \"one of the most virtuous and wise sons\" of this city.\n\nAround town, there are numerous reminders of Colston, Bristol's most famous philanthropist: Streets, schools, a concert hall and an office tower are all named after him. A big stained glass window in Bristol Cathedral is dedicated to him. Even a local delicacy bears his name \u2014 the Colston bun, a sort of fruit strudel.\n\nBut there's also a dark side to Colston, one that's been long known but less prominently acknowledged: He made his fortune trading African slaves.\n\n\"I remember finding out how he made his money. That turned my world upside down,\" says Katie Finnegan-Clarke, 30, who attended Colston's Girls' School, a prestigious private school. When she was 14, one of her parents' friends told her about Colston's role in the slave trade.\n\n\"Having partaken so actively in so many school assemblies to celebrate him, it just made me feel sick,\" she says. \"It disturbs me.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Lauren Frayer/NPR Lauren Frayer/NPR\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, Bristol's port sent thousands of ships to trade African slaves for tobacco, sugar and rum in the New World. Colston was a member and later head of the Royal African Company, which held a slave-trading monopoly in Britain. He also traded sugar and other commodities harvested or produced by slaves in the British West Indies. He bequeathed his wealth to charities in his hometown, founding homeless shelters known as almshouses and many schools.\n\nNow, in the era of Black Lives Matter, and just as Confederate statues are taken down in some parts of the American South, Bristol is rethinking how it commemorates its biggest benefactor.\n\nTrustees of the city's premier music venue, Colston Hall, announced last year that when the facility reopens in 2020 after renovations, it will do so under a new name, as yet unannounced.\n\n\"We just couldn't reopen a building with some public money in it that was under the banner of a slave trader,\" says spokeswoman Sarah Robertson. \"There are sections of Bristol society who feel shame and embarrassment stepping into our building because of our name.\"\n\nFor years, the rock band Massive Attack, whose members come from Bristol, has refused to play at Colston Hall because of its name. That boycott grew two years ago with the creation of Countering Colston, a group of artists and activists lobbying for the removal of Colston's name from Bristol's institutions. The group was founded by Finnegan-Clarke and some of her former classmates.\n\nWhile many activists have praised plans for the name change, there has also been criticism.\n\nThe BBC reported last year that opponents of the name change made comments on Facebook calling it \"political correctness gone mad\" and saying the \"past should not be airbrushed out.\"\n\n\"We were accused of erasing history by changing the name,\" Robertson says. \"People thought we were dredging up a past that people would rather not remember. They want to forget about Bristol's slave-trading past.\"\n\nCurators at a Bristol museum, the M Shed, want to make sure that doesn't happen. The museum is located on a wharf in Bristol's harbor, where slave ships used to dock. Inside, there's a video of a spoken-word performance about racial stereotypes by Bristol's first poet laureate, Miles Chambers, who is black. There is also a huge map of the city from 1769, showing all the landmarks built with the profits of slavery.\n\n\"The idea is just to know that an awful lot of Bristol is built on the slave trade. From big houses, to the Bristol Old Vic \u2014 the oldest working theater in the country,\" explains curator Sue Giles.\n\nGiles does not agree with the Countering Colston activists, who want Colston's name erased from the city. It's better to remember, she believes.\n\n\"If you keep changing everything, people forget,\" she says. \"You don't know who Colston was, so there's no discussion of his role in the slave trade, about Bristol's role in the slave trade.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Lauren Frayer /NPR Lauren Frayer /NPR\n\nBut for many black Bristolians \u2014 who are a small but growing part of the city's population \u2014 having to see Colston's name on streets and buildings across their city is painful. Most black people in Britain are of Afro-Caribbean descent. Some of their ancestors were African slaves brought to Jamaica and other British territories before Parliament outlawed slavery in 1833.\n\n\"We're not at that position yet where there's enough empathy with the journey that people who were enslaved have been through,\" says Cleo Lake, 38, an artist and activist whose father is from Jamaica. \"I'm very angry at the fact that my taxes have gone towards lining the pockets of elite people, who still hold a lot of that wealth. I definitely believe in reparations.\"\n\nOnly in 2015 did Bristol taxpayers finish paying off the equivalent of $428 billion (in today's dollars) in loans the city took out in 1833 to compensate slave merchants for the loss of their trade, after slavery was outlawed.\n\nLake attended Colston's Girls' School and helped found the Countering Colston group. Her next target is the giant Colston statue towering over a city square, off Colston Avenue. She wants it removed.\n\nBristol \"has given the statue of Colston a pride of place, and this doesn't sit right with me anymore,\" she says.\n\nThe city recently announced plans to install a new plaque on the statue, to explain Colston's links to the slave trade. But it says the statue will remain where it is.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Lauren Frayer/NPR Lauren Frayer/NPR\n\nAfter Colston Hall announced its plans for a name change, Colston's Primary School followed suit, saying it will change its name ahead of the start of the next school year in September.\n\nBut Colston's Girls School has refused to change its name.\n\nBristol's Old Vic Theater, founded 250 years ago by local slave merchants, has launched a \"year of change\" in its programming, to ensure black playwrights are represented in its repertoire, says chief executive Emma Stenning.\n\nShe sees a link between what's happening in Bristol and the United States.\n\n\"You see many cities and many communities asking themselves, 'What are the things we choose to commemorate? What's missing from the history that we are telling?'\" Stenning says. \"That is definitely in the air.\"\n\nIn St. Paul's, a traditionally Afro-Caribbean neighborhood, artist Michele Curtis is taking matters into her own hands. She's been painting murals on city walls to honor the black citizens of Bristol. She'd like to see the city rename some of its landmarks.\n\n\"All the streets are named after slave merchants. But you don't really see that for black people that have contributed,\" Curtis says. \"Of course, it's just the name of a building. It's not really that important.

NPR's Audie Cornish speaks to NPR Code Switch reporter Gene Demby about why people seem reluctant to call him a terrorist.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nThis week began with the city of Austin, Texas, terrorized after a series of bombings. It ends with the suspect dead and investigators trying to answer the why behind the attacks. In between, the bombings themselves and their coverage spurred a national conversation around race and how we talk about perpetrators of violence. The suspect in the Austin bombings, who is white, has been described as troubled by both police and the media.\n\nNPR Code Switch reporter Gene Demby has been looking at this. Welcome to the studio.\n\nGENE DEMBY, BYLINE: Hey, Audie.\n\nCORNISH: So what exactly are people taking issue with?\n\nDEMBY: We should start with this clip of the police chief in Austin talking about a 25-minute confession that was found on the bombing suspect's cellphone.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nCHIEF BRIAN MANLEY: It is the outcry of a very challenged young man talking about challenges in his personal life that led him to this point.\n\nDEMBY: And so a lot of people feel like if that suspect weren't white, that he would not have been extended that same sympathy.\n\nCORNISH: But is there any actual evidence - right? - to support the idea that different language is being used when it comes to, let's say, non-white perpetrators of mass violence?\n\nDEMBY: So first we should just make sure that we're not conflating statements from the police and the way that news outlets report these stories. But part of the coverage has to be devoted to what the police chief said. And there's a lot of research that shows that race does shape the way that cases of violence like this are covered in the news and that the characterization of this suspect by this police chief fits into this larger idea that white perpetrators of these kinds of attacks are portrayed if not sympathetically then at least not as terrorists. They're portrayed as challenged or troubled.\n\nThere was a headline this week in the news that read, quote, \"Maryland School Shooter Apparently Was A Lovesick Teen,\" unquote. And it was referring to a white high school student who shot two other students at a high school in Maryland. And that characterization came from the police, but that was the headline that was propagated on social media and elsewhere.\n\nCORNISH: So you saying people have actually looked at this question of whether, like, if the same shooter had been Muslim or of Middle Eastern descent, that the headline would have somehow been different.\n\nDEMBY: Right. And I spoke to someone named Erin Kearns at the University of Alabama. She studies terrorism and how it's covered in the news. She pointed to research that shows that - how the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando was covered versus how the shooting at Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston was covered. The shooter at the Pulse nightclub was of Arab descent, and Dylann Roof, the shooter at the Charleston church, was white.\n\nERIN KEARNS: And just comparing those two cases, they found that Omar Mateen was called a terrorist. It was described as terrorism, whereas Dylann Roof was called mentally ill. There was some discussion of whether or not to label it terrorism, but the media overall didn't label it as terrorism even though it very clearly meets an academic definition of what terrorism is.\n\nDEMBY: Now, that academic definition of terrorism is ideologically motivated violence that is meant to intimidate. In Kearns' own work, she and her colleagues found that when the strict definition of terrorism does apply to an attack, there's about four and a half times more coverage of one of those incidents in print media if the perpetrator was Muslim than if they were white.\n\nCORNISH: One argument I've seen is that somehow we should just expand the definition of terrorist - right? - so that it would include someone like Dylann Roof or the Austin, Texas, bomber.\n\nDEMBY: So this is what a lot of people want. They're frustrated by the idea that if we use terrorism to only describe politically or ideologically motivated violence, that it wouldn't include a case like this. There's a moral weight to calling something terrorism. And when white perpetrators are excluded from that categorization, it feels like we're letting them off the hook or treating it in some way as an aberration.\n\nBut Kearns would say that instead of expanding the definition of terrorism, we might all be better served by being more cautious in how we use it and more consistent in how we use it regardless of who the perpetrator is.\n\nCORNISH: NPR Code Switch reporter Gene Demby, thanks for looking into it for us.\n\nDEMBY: Thank you for having me, Audie.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ADAM FREELAND'S \"FABRICLIVE 16: ADAM FREELAND\")\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

Even in 2017, that's unusual.\n\nAs the city's weed industry grows, the players who are most likely to jump in on the \"green rush\" have two things in common: They are overwhelmingly white, and have access to lots of money.\n\nSo together, Senter, Unsworth, Parks and Lencho decided to change that.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Supernova Women Courtesy of Supernova Women\n\nIn 2015, they started an organization called Supernova Women, which offers free educational seminars to locals who are interested in the weed business. They talk about how they managed to break into the industry, as well as some of the pitfalls.\n\nAnd, in the spirit of consciousness-raising, they've created a safe space where prospective entrepreneurs can talk about what it feels like to be the only person of color in a mostly white space.\n\n\"Supernovas are a quiet force in the universe,\" Senter says. \"Things gravitate towards supernovas, and we saw all of us coming together as just being this huge force that could not be ignored. Because the issues that we were facing could not be ignored.\"\n\nFor our podcast episode this week, we spoke with Amber Senter and Andrea Unsworth about Supernova Women and about the challenges they've faced in an industry run predominantly by white people. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat are the barriers of entry for people of color trying to operate a successful weed business?\n\n\n\nSenter: Our skin color, obviously, because people don't have to give us anything because of that. I mean, not only am I black, but I'm also a woman. Two levels of barriers there. Convincing someone to give you $250,000 so you can start a business, that's challenging in itself. Even with all the experience that might be bringing to the table, you're still going to get doubted.\n\nWhereas if I were a white man, coming up with some corny idea \u2014 people are just throwing money at them. You know? And then there's other people who have proven product, made a million dollars in sales on their own, and are having problems raising $100,000, because they're people of color, women of color in the industry. We deal with the same barriers that would exist in any industry, and then it's compounded because we're talking about a federally illegal substance.\n\nYou say it can be really hard, as a manufacturer, to go into a dispensary and talk to the buyer, because the buyer is a often a white guy. Can you break down that dynamic?\n\nSenter: First of all, when you're walking up to the dispensary, the people of color that are working in the dispensary are either going to be the security crew or the bud tenders, but none of the management. No one that's making any decisions. But that's how the whole industry currently is. Me, as a manufacturer looking for investment \u2014 there's no people of color investors. I mean they're out there, but they're hard to find.\n\nUnsworth: At the end of the day, we've been locking up people of color for 30 years, who have been selling cannabis. Now that it's legal, they say, \"Great, it's legal, but you have to have a million dollars to start.\"\n\nWell, how can you have a million dollars if, for the past 30 years, you and all your relatives have been getting locked up and trying to spend that money on bail money? And raising your family without a father, without an uncle, without a son? Those are the realities.\n\nThis whole thing of starting on a level playing field is ridiculous. [Nearly] 80 percent of the lock-ups are people of color. You're locking up all of these people who are trying to be entrepreneurs, but now that it's legal, you're allowed to say, \"Oh, you can come into our industry, but you can't have a criminal record. You can have a million dollars, but it can't be from cannabis, it has to be from your 401(k), or investments, or from your daddy.\"\n\nI mean, who are these people? These are not people of color.\n\nOn the site for Supernova Women, it says you want to foster a space for hard conversations. What type of hard conversations are y'all having?\n\nSenter: I'm a manufacturer. We make cannabis products that we turn around and sell to dispensaries. And often times going into the dispensary, I have to deal with people that do not look like me. Typically white males. And I've got to convince them to first hear me out, and then try my product and then, if they think the product is good enough, to get it on their shelves.\n\nWith the cultural differences and everything, these things are a fine dance, and a lot of people feel uncomfortable when you bring up these kinds of situations and things that we deal with. And I'm saying a lot of people \u2014 it's white folks. You know, they don't want to hear these things. So we create a safe space where we can discuss these issues and real-life things that we deal with daily.\n\nUnsworth: And I would say that those are the type of conversations that prompted things like the Oakland Equity Program, because that was not even on the table when we were first talking about cannabis.\n\nAt least we need to recognize that there has been an unfair \u2014 an unjust war \u2014 on people of color that has had an impact over the past 20 to 30 years, that has kept them out of the cannabis industry that is now burgeoning. And so if we're going to have folks coming into the cannabis industry, we have to at least acknowledge that there has been demonstrable damage done to a lot of these communities that would love to be entrepreneurs that should have been some of the first in line.\n\nBecause they've had innovative products and they've had the network, and they've had the skill to distribute cannabis for years, but were maybe locked up or put behind bars or just, you know, didn't have enough.", "keywords": ["theyve", "legally", "youre", "selling", "black", "white", "things", "color", "cannabis", "women", "industry", "weed", "supernova"], "polarity": 0.05500380517503807, "subjectivity": 0.4687404870624048},

America was built on her citizens. ... Look at the 19th century. What built America's called the American system, from Hamilton to Polk to Henry Clay to Lincoln to the Roosevelts. [It was] a system of protection of our manufacturing, financial system that lends to manufacturers, OK, and the control of our borders. Economic nationalism is what this country was built on. The American system.\" \u2013 Steve Bannon\n\nPresident Trump's former strategic adviser offered this riff about American history on CBS's 60 Minutes. He was responding to interviewer Charlie Rose, who said that \"people have been able to come here, find a place, contribute to the economy. That's what immigration has been in America.\" Bannon said he was \"dead wrong.\"\n\nSo let's explore: Does the history Bannon cited support his case?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AP AP\n\nFirst: Alexander Hamilton was an immigrant. He was born in the West Indies. In the 18th century he fought for his adopted country in war (as immigrants often have) and then, as treasury secretary, he contributed immensely to his adopted country's economy (as immigrants often have). He argued for the government to pay Revolutionary War debts, dreamed up a sophisticated financial system, and ended up on the $10 bill. Even in the 21st century, he continues to generate economic activity as the subject of a Broadway musical.\n\nBannon is close enough in calling Hamilton a citizen, since he was present at the founding of the country \u2014 although all Founding Fathers were immigrants or the descendants of immigrants, who arrived in the territory of native nations. This illustrates the essential problem in claiming the country was built by citizens and not immigrants: Immigrants often contributed and also became citizens.\n\nIt's meaningful that Bannon cites Abraham Lincoln, too, in his argument about immigrants. In 1862, Lincoln signed legislation supporting construction of a transcontinental railroad, which began a few years later. It was difficult to find laborers willing to work in harsh conditions, so railroad executives hired immigrants. Chinese workers were among those who laid tracks over the mountains from the west, until they met crews of Irish laborers coming from the east. Their meeting in Utah was an iconic American moment.\n\nImmigrants contributed more than brawn. During the Civil War, Confederate rebels launched the Virginia, a seemingly invulnerable ironclad warship. President Lincoln's government responded with its own ironclad, called the Monitor, so innovative that it became the ancestor of all modern warships. It was designed by a brilliant engineer named John Ericsson, a Swedish immigrant.\n\nAs a politician, Lincoln was forced to address resistance to immigration. A powerful anti-immigrant movement rose up in the 1840s and '50s against Irish Catholics. The Know-Nothings, as they were called, won many elections, but Lincoln declined to join them. \"I am not a Know-Nothing,\" Lincoln wrote. \"That is certain. How can any one who abhors the oppression of negroes, be in favor of degrading classes of white people? Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid.\"\n\nBannon also asserts that 19th century Americans focused on \"the control of our borders.\" That is the opposite of the case. Americans were repeatedly moving beyond their borders. American settlers captured much of Tennessee from American Indians; they took parts of Florida from Spain; and in the most audacious move of all, sheared off Texas from Mexico. In each case some of the Americans involved could have been labeled \"illegal immigrants.\" One of the presidents Bannon referenced, James K. Polk, confirmed the annexation of Texas by going to war against Mexico. Some Mexicans perforce became Americans, because the borders had moved past them.\n\nBannon also cites specific 19th century economic policies. He is correct that there really was an \"American System.\" Sen. Henry Clay of Kentucky made that his brand name for a basket of programs. Clay supported tariffs on imports to protect American industry. He supported internal improvements, such as roads and canals. And he supported the creation of a national bank (an idea borrowed from the immigrant Hamilton).\n\nClay's system was immensely appealing to many Americans \u2014 Lincoln among them. It set the terms of national debate for decades. But tariffs that Clay supported also caused intense political conflict, and were denounced as special interest deals for manufacturers. When South Carolina first defied federal authority around 1830, decades before the Civil War, the dispute was not over slavery but a tariff. Then as now, there were arguments for and against any given tariff. The arguments against them are ones Bannon has employed in other contexts. A protective tariff empowers the government to interfere in the economy, and demands supreme wisdom by government officials to avoid unforeseen consequences. Tariffs may become tools of what Bannon has described as \"the administrative state,\" which he proposed to \"deconstruct\" when in the White House.\n\nThe \"administrative state\" argument was also used against Clay's Bank of the United States \u2014 it was described as a corrupt and unconstitutional exercise of government power. Who made this case? Andrew Jackson, a president Bannon reveres and compares to Donald Trump. Jackson also famously vetoed Clay-supported road building. The fight between Jackson and Clay was part of an eternal American debate over the scope of government. In his use of history, Bannon has favored both sides of this argument.\n\nThe 19th century was a time of tremendous growth and ferment in the United States, when Americans were wrestling with some of the same questions we face now: Who are we? What does our country stand for? And who counts as an American?\n\nBannon is correct to find this history relevant, though perhaps not the way he intends. He's right that Americans built a powerful country in the 19th century. But that country was diverse, fed off immigration, was constantly changing, and was not really walled off from the world. Any suggestion otherwise is factually wrong.\n\nSteve Inskeep is co-host of NPR's Morning Edition and is writing a book on America's 19th century westward expansion.", "keywords": ["check", "fact", "century", "19th", "steve", "americans", "war", "america", "1800s", "bannons", "kind", "lincoln", "country", "immigrants", "bannon", "system", "american"], "polarity": 0.14430465367965367, "subjectivity": 0.4239989177489178},

Every so often, NPR Host/Special Correspondent Michele Norris will dip into those six-word stories to explore issues surrounding race and cultural identity for Morning Edition.\n\nThe wrenching film 12 Years a Slave, based on true events, re-creates the story of a free black man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the 1840s. The Golden Globe-winning film has prompted an uptick in six-word entries concerning slavery sent to the Race Card Project, particularly from people who have tried to uncover their own family connections to slavery.\n\nFor many of those people, like Robert Goins of San Francisco, the search can be difficult \u2014 and the discoveries painful.\n\nGoins was researching his ancestors in North Carolina a decade ago when he stumbled upon grief while going through a ledger on microfiche \u2014 hence, his six-word submission: \"Found my ancestors and grief too.\"\n\n\"I found my great-grandfather's family and some notes held at the North Carolina archives,\" Goins tells Norris. \"The family lived in Belews Creek \u2014 and Sauratown.\" Sauratown, Goins notes, sounds like \"sorrow.\"\n\nIn his search, Goins found a ledger containing the name of the overseer of the plantation where the family members were enslaved, he explains. \"When I first read it, it looked like 'Grief.' I actually think the overseer's name was 'Greif,' but I could not help but see it as Grief,\" Goins says.\n\n\"Grief is here. Grief will not let me go any further until I acknowledge it. Finding grief stopped me in my tracks,\" he adds.\n\nEven 10 years later, the discovery still affects him, Goins says. He vividly recalls rolling his fingers across the microfiche image and seeing his ancestors listed among livestock and farm implements. He says he felt like a swimmer who needed to find air.\n\nTo get his head back above water, Goins kept digging. He needed to find some stories, he says, \"that were not as difficult to handle. ... I needed stories where [my ancestors] were ... autonomous, they were doing things, they were living, they had children, you could see their movement. They weren't put on a place and [told], 'You had to stay here.' \"\n\nSo Goins dug into another branch of the family, he says. And he found a very different document in \"The Order Book,\" held at the Albemarle County Courthouse in Charlottesville, Va. The book, Norris explains, was akin to a government census used to keep track of free black people in the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n\nGoins found a reference there to his great-great-great-grandfather, Michael Goings, who was born in 1805 or 1806 in Albemarle County, Va., and lived as a freeman.\n\nRobert Goins' great-great-great-grandfather was noted in a 19th century Order Book, used to track free black people in the Commonwealth of Virginia.

He moved from Ohio to Michigan during the runup to the Civil War and moved back to Ohio after the Civil War,\" Goins explains. \"His wife died a few months before he did.\"\n\nDiscovering an ancestor who was born in a state where 90 percent of black people were enslaved \u2014 and who nevertheless managed to obtain his freedom \u2014 meant everything to Goins, Norris explains. \"The fact that he worked and earned wages \u2014 that finally made him feel like his head was above water,\" she says.\n\nAs Goins describes it, \"I felt grounded. I felt like, 'Wow, why didn't I know this all of my life?' This is what I needed. I needed this to help me in difficult times. I needed to hear that they survived and that I could survive as well.\"\n\nNevertheless, Goins still feels burdened by his discovery. The history he has uncovered is still difficult to talk about, he says, even with members of his own family. That's something the Race Card Project hears often in relation to personal stories about slavery, Norris explains \u2014 \"especially when people go digging.\"", "keywords": ["familys", "explains", "goins", "freedom", "race", "black", "grief", "family", "needed", "norris", "history", "slavery", "discovering", "difficult"], "polarity": -0.13277777777777777, "subjectivity": 0.48400000000000004},

The proposed budget would cut the office's $15.4 million in funding and the 54 positions that are currently authorized.\n\nThis move would essentially gut a key agency that helps broker compromise in these hyperpartisan times, says Grande Lum, the former director of the CRS. He tells Here & Now's Robin Young he is concerned that moving the agency closer to prosecutors will deter people from requesting help for fear of a lawsuit.\n\n\"What's important is that for parties to be willing to come to the table, they need to be comfortable that whatever is said is held confidential, and that they are not at any potential danger of being prosecuted here,\" says Lum, who is now director of the Divided Community Project at Ohio State University. \"So moving it, the function, to the Civil Rights Division would effectively end its function.\"\n\nIn its more than 50-year history, the CRS has helped protect the First Amendment and keep people safe during the Selma-to-Montgomery marches, eased tensions during desegregation in Boston, and aided in resolving the Native American standoff at Wounded Knee, S.D., in 1973.\n\nJustice Department official Lee Loftus told reporters in February the CRS is a \"small entity in Justice today.\"\n\n\"We are very aware that there are some potential issues if you combine them, because there needs to be some segregation between CRS and its responsibilities under the Civil Rights Act and the functions that [the Civil Rights Division] may have in its regular investigative and prosecution responsibilities,\" Loftus said.\n\nThe CRS has long faced backlash from those on the right. The Heritage Foundation has described the agency as \"highly politicized\" and said it has \"actually escalated local tensions in such places as Ferguson, Missouri, and Florida following the arrest of George Zimmerman.\"\n\nBut those who have sought the CRS's help tell a different story. After the killing of Travyon Martin in 2012, Mayor Jeff Triplett invited CRS mediators to Sanford, Fla., to hold meetings between local officials and the thousands of protesters who descended on the city.\n\n\"I'd hate to say that we couldn't have done it without [CRS], but I'd much rather learn from someone else's experience rather than my own misfortune,\" he said.\n\nTriplett told MSNBC in 2013 that the city was overwhelmed by the massive influx of protesters, and the CRS helped local officials properly prepare for demonstrations during the weeks-long trial that followed.\n\n\"There were dozens of protests, but there was not a single arrest, not a single glass bottle thrown,\" Lum says. \"We were able to have ... free speech, and we were able to maintain public safety.\"\n\nIn a time of deep political divisions, the changes being proposed could slash the prospect of healing communities and reaching compromise, Lum says.\n\nPart of the problem is that political identities are growing more and more personal. The Pew Research Center measured a growing disdain for the opposing party from 1994 to 2014 with 43 percent of Republicans and 38 percent of Democrats viewing the opposite party very unfavorably.\n\nAfter the violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., last summer, an independent review concluded the Charlottesville Police Department should have responded to community criticism before the demonstration took place. In the aftermath of that attack, Charlottesville officials did request help from the CRS in recovery efforts.\n\n\"Community engagement is paramount for proactive, effective policing,\" the report noted. \"CPD must commit on an ongoing basis to being a citizen-centric partner in promoting community well-being rather than a reactive, independent force.\"\n\nLum acknowledges the difficulty of engaging critics when they are radical groups like neo-Nazis or gun rights enthusiasts, but he says conflict resolution techniques employed by CRS can help \"tell the third story.\"\n\n\"It's the ability to focus first on what matters \u2014 'OK, I wanna hear your story, I have my story,\" Lum says. \"But what's a story that we can both agree to?' In gun control, we wanna prevent tragedies.

Bill Cassidy, R-La., touted Tuesday on Capitol Hill that his plan passes the \"Jimmy Kimmel test.\"\n\nThat is a phrase the lawmaker coined back in May because the late night host has been outspoken about his young son's heart condition and the amount of money it would cost someone who didn't have health insurance before the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, became law to obtain the kind of care his son has needed.\n\n\"I ask, 'Does it pass the \"Jimmy Kimmel test\"?' \" Cassidy, a medical doctor, said in May of Republican health care proposals. \"Will a child born with congenital heart disease be able to get everything she or he would need in the first year of life? I want it to pass the 'Jimmy Kimmel test.' \"\n\nKimmel pressed Cassidy to follow through on his word in a tweet in June and outlined his definition of the \"Kimmel test,\" which he reiterated Tuesday night.\n\nBut Kimmel said the latest bill doesn't pass the test. He used his late night platform to knock down Cassidy's health care plan, which the GOP is trying to pass by the end of the month, point by point. He said Cassidy, whom Kimmel quizzed on his show before the plan came out, \"lied right to my face.\"\n\n\"Health care is complicated; it's boring; I don't want to talk about it,\" Kimmel said. \"The details are confusing, and that's what these guys are relying on. They're counting on you to be so overwhelmed with all the information, you just trust them to take care of you. But they're not taking care of you. They're taking care of the people who give them money like insurance companies, and we're all just looking at our Instagram accounts liking things, while they're voting on whether people can afford to keep their children alive or not. Most of the congresspeople who vote on this bill probably won't even read it. And they want us to do the same thing. They want us to treat it like an iTunes service agreement. And this guy, Bill Cassidy, just lied right to my face.\"\n\nIn his monologue, Kimmel urged that no matter how much money a family makes, there should be no annual or lifetime caps. Because of the high cost of procedures like open-heart surgery, lifetime or annual caps on what insurers pay out mean families foot the rest of the bill.\n\nSince states decide the rules, according to Cassidy's plan, Kimmel argues that inevitably, there will be states where caps will be instituted and families will be hurt.\n\nKimmel laid out four points that Cassidy had said he wanted in a health care bill:\n\n1. Coverage for all\n\n2. No discrimination based on pre-existing conditions\n\n3. Lower premiums for middle-class families\n\n4. No lifetime caps\n\n\"I'm sorry he does not understand,\" Cassidy said Wednesday morning on CNN about Kimmel, adding that under the new bill, \"more people will have coverage.\"\n\nThat's almost certainly not true, given the Medicaid expansion rollback that would take place under the bill. Medicaid expansion accounted for the largest drop in the uninsured under the ACA.\n\nWhat's more, Republicans are trying to push the bill through before the Congressional Budget Office can weigh in with an analysis of how much it would cost and how many people could lose insurance. Prior versions of Republican health bills care all showed millions more would no longer be insured compared with under the ACA.\n\n\"Not only did he fail the 'Jimmy Kimmel test,' \" Kimmel said, \"it failed the 'Bill Cassidy test.' \"\n\nAs Kimmel drove home his points, the audience groaned. Those groans revealed something else \u2014 the audience, not unexpectedly, was not familiar with the details of the Cassidy plan, which is co-sponsored by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.\n\nAnd that raises another important point \u2014 in this era in which trust in politicians, Congress, Washington and democratic institutions, including the news media, is on the decline, people are looking to others they trust to impart and make sense of information.\n\nThat was true of Jon Stewart when he hosted The Daily Show, and polls began to reveal that his show was a principal \"news\" source for many young people.\n\nSo it's not surprising that a popular \u2014 formerly fairly apolitical \u2014 late night host with a compelling personal storyline to draw on could have a broader effect than other traditional influencers.\n\n\"I never imagined I would get involved in something like this,\" Kimmel said. \"This is not my area of expertise. My area of expertise is eating pizza, and that's really about it. But we can't let them do this to our children and our senior citizens and our veterans or to any of us.\"\n\nFor those who say Kimmel has crossed over and become too political. He had a message for them, too: \"Before you post the nasty Facebook message saying I'm politicizing my son's health problems, I want you to know, I am politicizing my son's health problems, because I have to. But my family has health insurance. We don't have to worry about this, but other people do.

{"title": "FACT CHECK: 4 Claims From Trump's Tax Speech", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2017/08/30/547411439/fact-check-4-claims-from-trumps-tax-speech", "text": "FACT CHECK: 4 Claims From Trump's Tax Speech\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPresident Trump pitched a tax overhaul package on Wednesday in a speech that was heavy on politicking and light on the particulars.\n\nTrump's tax policy ideas are still sketchy \u2014 when pitched in April, they amounted to one page of bullet points. In his Wednesday remarks, he didn't add much more detail beyond the broad strokes, saying he wants lower rates for the middle class, a simpler tax code, lower corporate rates and for companies to \"bring back [their] money\" from overseas to the U.S.\n\nIn his speech in Springfield, Mo., though, he said a few things that were misleading or could use more context. Here are four fact checks:\n\n1. Economic growth rate\n\n\"We just announced that we hit 3 percent in GDP. Just came out. And on a yearly basis, as you know, the last administration during an eight-year period never hit 3 percent. So we're really on our way.\"\n\nHe's right that on Wednesday, the Commerce Department announced that the economy grew at a 3 percent rate in the second quarter. This was an upward revision from a previously announced 2.6 percent (and will still be revised again).\n\nBut he is making it sound as if growth during his administration is already appreciably faster than it was during the Obama administration. That's not true. Quarterly GDP growth during the Obama presidency did hit 3 percent several times.\n\nThere's a technicality here, though: Trump used the phrase \"on a yearly basis.\" If he's talking about calendar years, he's right, but barely. According to Commerce Department data, annual GDP growth during Obama's presidency hit a high of 2.9 percent in 2015 \u2014 so, just shy of 3 percent. But then, if he is measuring any given 12-month period, he's not right; year-over-year GDP growth was at times over 3 percent during the Obama presidency.\n\nEither way, that 3 percent rate he pulled out is how annual growth would look if growth from the second quarter were to hold for a full year. Reporting the GDP rate in this annual way makes it easier to show whether growth was faster in, say, this quarter than it was in prior years. But once again, it still has that hypothetical aspect to it.\n\nAnd that leads to a more important point here: Many economists believe that sustained 3 percent growth, like Trump says he can help create, is unlikely. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget earlier this year tried to game out how that kind of GDP growth could happen. Its outlook was not rosy.\n\n\"By our estimates, returning capital growth, productivity growth, and prime-age labor force participation to where they were in the 1990s would result in 2.9-percent growth,\" they wrote. And getting to those levels, they added, would be \"an unlikely scenario given recent trends.\"\n\nIn other words, while Trump is celebrating this one quarter of growth, seeing it quarter after quarter after quarter would be a surprise.\n\n2. Comparing U.S. growth with other countries'\n\n\"You look at other countries and you look at what their GDP is, they're unhappy when it's 7, 8, 9. And I speak to them, leaders of the countries \u2014 'How are you doing?' 'Not well. Not well.' 'Why?' 'GDP is down to 7 percent.' And I'm saying, 'We were hitting 1 percent just a number of months ago.' \"\n\nWe can't fact-check Trump here in the strictest sense (that is, we don't really know what these other leaders are telling him), but we can check the assumption that we can compare the U.S.'s growth rate with other countries'. The answer: It doesn't work like that.\n\n\"The countries that are growing at 7 percent are emerging market economies like China or India or other emerging market economies,\" said Nick Lardy, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nHe explained that these countries have what some economists call a \"latecomer advantage\" \u2014 an additional lift that comes from starting out behind other countries. For example, he pointed to China, which has grown quickly in part because of foreign firms coming in and setting up shop there. So when Volkswagen sets up a plant in China, it's bringing in processes and technologies from the outside.\n\n\"They can do joint ventures or have foreign firms come in, they can license technology, they can improve labor productivity,\" he explained.\n\nThis is what helps a country like China or India have an economic growth rate of around 7 percent.\n\n3. A \"simple\" tax code\n\n\"We need a tax code that is simple, fair and easy to understand. And that means getting rid of loopholes and complexity that primarily benefit the wealthiest Americans and special interests. Our last major tax rewrite was 31 years ago. It eliminated dozens of loopholes and special interest tax rates, reduced the number of tax brackets from 15 to two, and lowered tax rates for individuals and businesses. Since then, tax laws have tripled in size.\"\n\nThe Reagan tax plan, approved by Congress in 1986, did cut back on loopholes, and it did cut the number of brackets down to two.\n\nBut there's one important point buried in here, and it's that bit about the number of tax brackets and setting rates. Trump said he wants to make the tax code \"simple, fair, and easy to understand.\" Brackets and rates are not what make the tax code byzantine (\"fair\" is subjective, and we're staying out of that here).\n\n\"It's a very mild form of simplification,\" said William Gale, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Brookings Institution, a liberal-leaning Washington think tank, in an interview with NPR in 2015. \"The real complication in the system is in the tax base, not in the rate structure. Figuring out how you calculate capital gains or figuring out whether you're eligible for the [earned income tax credit for lower-income Americans], given the child rules \u2014 once you've got that, then you just plug in the rates.\"\n\nThe brackets-simplicity argument is one Americans are bound to hear more as Congress debates a tax code overhaul; politicians try to draw this connection often. But slicing down deductions \u2014 and potentially upsetting some groups of voters \u2014 could be a tougher sell.\n\n4. The corporate tax rate\n\n\"Today we are still taxing our businesses at 35 percent. And it's way more than that. And think of it \u2014 in some cases way above 40 percent when you include state and local taxes in various states. The United States is now behind France, behind Germany, behind Canada, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and many other nations also.\"\n\nThe top federal corporate tax rate is indeed 35 percent, and in some states, corporate tax rates can push that rate higher. In Iowa, the top corporate rate is 12 percent, and in five other states plus the District of Columbia, the rate is 9 percent or higher, according to the right-leaning Tax Foundation. (One could quibble with \"way higher,\" then, but in general, Trump is right on this.)\n\nThat's what puts the U.S. \"behind\" other countries, in Trump's estimation. Except what matters is the effective tax rate. Deductions and credits help bring U.S. companies' tax rates below what they would otherwise pay. The effective tax rate for U.S. corporations is only around 18.6 percent, which is on the high end compared with other advanced economies but not unusually high \u2014 it's a few percentage points below Japan, a few above Germany, and right in line with the U.K.\n\nAnd those tax rates vary widely from firm to firm: A recent report found that out of 258 profitable Fortune 500 companies, 39 percent paid zero corporate taxes in at least one year between 2008 and 2015.", "keywords": ["claims", "tax", "fact", "speech", "check", "rate", "trumps", "quarter", "countries", "gdp", "way", "trump", "rates", "corporate", "growth"], "polarity": 0.06621248499399764, "subjectivity": 0.40658563425370153},

And for state government coffers, the Republican-led overhaul may not cut as cleanly along ideological lines as Democrats say.\n\nMontana\n\nTake Montana, which Donald Trump won by 20 points. The state Legislature is dominated by Republicans who are championing the new federal tax law as nothing but good news for the state.\n\nBut Montana's governor, Democrat Steve Bullock, warns the tax changes could pose a threat to his state's finances.\n\n\"This is a bad deal for Montana and for families all across the country,\" Bullock wrote in a tweet soon after Congress passed the tax overhaul.\n\nThis month, the head of the governor's budgeting office announced the state could expect to lose $20 million in revenue over the next two years, mainly because of how the federal law changes the way Montana collects corporate income tax.\n\nAnd $20 million is on the low end of projections by state economists.\n\n\"With experts on both sides, we thought it appropriate to err on the side of less loss to state revenue, because that was really the legislative intent in Congress,\" Montana State Budget Director Dan Villa said. \"It was not the intent to have that implication come down on the state.\"\n\nMontana Senate Majority Leader Fred Thomas says the analysis by the governor's office is nothing but politics.\n\n\"We don't see any impact except positive impacts,\" Thomas said.\n\nThe Montana Legislature meets once every two years, and there are no plans to call a special session to deal with the disagreement over projections. Although, state lawmakers could be called back into session if consensus grows around a loss more than the governor's estimate of $20 million.\n\nNotably, the Montana Department of Revenue suggests it could be more than double that. Director Mike Kadas, a Bullock appointee, cites the fact that Montana is one of 17 states coupling their tax code with federal law in a way that could result in a loss in personal and corporate income tax.\n\nHow Blue States Are Making End Run Around New GOP Tax Law How Blue States Are Making End Run Around New GOP Tax Law Listen \u00b7 10:25 10:25\n\nMaryland\n\nMaryland is not one of those 17. The Mid-Atlantic, left-leaning state is expecting a windfall from the Republican-led update to the federal tax code.\n\nThe state comptroller's office expects a boost to state and local income tax revenue of at least $300 million in a single year, unless the state General Assembly acts to prevent it.\n\nMaryland's tax code is more directly coupled with the federal code, so Maryland taxpayers can take most of the same deductions on their federal and state tax returns.\n\n\"It's a very sensible choice that almost all states have made, basically to allow taxpayers who have calculated their taxes for the federal purposes just to take those same calculations, make just a couple of tweaks to figure out how much they owe the state,\" said Andrew Blair-Stanek, a tax specialist who teaches at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law.\n\nThis is intended to simplify the tax-filing process for residents, as well as enforcement for the state. But it also means taxpayers can only deduct something from their state taxes if they have already deducted it from their federal taxes.\n\nThe new federal law increases the standard deduction while limiting some previous deductions, such as the one for state and local taxes. As a result, roughly 700,000 Maryland residents who itemized deductions on their past tax returns will shrink their federal tax bills if they switch to the standard deduction, said Andrew Schaufele, director of the state Bureau of Revenue Estimates in the comptroller's office.\n\nBut if all 700,000 take the standard deduction on both their federal and state tax returns, the state is expected to collect about $483 million more.\n\nThe federal changes also reduce the personal exemption that taxpayers can claim on their income taxes to zero. Schaufele said it's unclear whether this would eliminate Maryland's personal exemption. If it does, state revenues stand to gain another $1.2 billion.\n\nFor states expecting a financial boost from the federal changes, \"in the short run, it could turn out to be a great thing,\" said Blair-Stanek. \"But over the long run, it will definitely increase the pressure on state and local governments to reduce taxes, or at least rein in increases.\"\n\nMaryland lawmakers have promised to pass legislation protecting taxpayers from the increases by the time the state's 90-day General Assembly session ends in April.\n\nGov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, said last week that he will introduce legislation allowing taxpayers to itemize deductions on their state returns even if they take the standard deduction on their federal returns.\n\n\"Under our proposed legislation, Marylanders will not pay one cent more in state taxes as a result of the actions at the federal level,\" he said.\n\nLeaders of the Democrat-controlled General Assembly are joining with Hogan to clarify the law and eliminate any risk to the state personal exemption \u2014 and at the same time seizing an opportunity to criticize congressional Republicans and Trump.\n\n\"It's an economic war between the red states against the blue states,\" said Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller.\n\nEven if so, the new federal tax code doesn't seem to be as accurate a weapon as feared.\n\nCorin Cates-Carney is Montana Public Radio's Capitol Bureau reporter.

Take this one from Melanie Vanderlipe Ramil of Sacramento, Calif.: \"I ate pasta, family ate rice.\"\n\nRamil's parents were Filipino immigrants, and in their household, rice was part of every meal. Her family used so much rice, Ramil says, they couldn't keep it in the cupboard. Instead, the centerpiece of the kitchen was a 4-foot-tall dispenser that held 50 pounds of rice.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Melanie Vanderlipe Ramil Courtesy of Melanie Vanderlipe Ramil\n\n\"I never knew life without it in my parents' kitchen,\" Ramil says. \"The bottom has a drawer. ... After you press your one, two or three cups, you'd pull the drawer out, and there \u2014 you're ready to make rice in your rice cooker.\n\n\"But my friends would come over and they would ask me what that was and be perplexed by it,\" she says. \"And I was confused right back at them, not knowing why they wouldn't know what a rice dispenser was.\"\n\nGrowing up, Ramil says, she \"wanted to be as non-Filipino as possible and felt great achievement whenever friends said to me, 'You seem so white!' \"\n\nShe was embarrassed when her friends came over and she couldn't offer them pizza, hot dogs or Tater Tots to eat.\n\n\"I just know that growing up, I had moments where I rejected Filipino culture,\" Ramil recalls. So when she reached middle school, Ramil told her parents that she didn't like rice.\n\nRamil's mother didn't object. \"My mom, after rushing home from work to cook dinner for us every day, relented and lovingly prepared pasta for me while the rest of the family ate rice,\" Ramil recalls.\n\n\"I just remember her scrambling in the kitchen. I always remember her coming home from work, still wearing her work clothes, with an apron ... running around making a hot meal every night for our sit-down family dinner,\" Ramil says.\n\n\"And then she would pull out my Pasta Roni box and prepare this processed pasta dish because I claimed not to like rice.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Melanie Vanderlipe Ramil Courtesy of Melanie Vanderlipe Ramil\n\nHer parents wanted their children to succeed in America, Ramil explains, and were trying to help them assimilate.\n\nNow 31, Ramil cringes a bit when she recounts the story. In fact, she wishes she had spent more time in the kitchen with her mother, learning the family dishes.\n\nShe credits a course she took in college, Filipino American Contemporary Issues, for her change in perspective. \"That dinky little class, that I thought would be nothing ... changed my life and my connection to identity,\" Ramil says.\n\nToday, Ramil's extended family is made up of more than 100 people. Many of her cousins have married non-Filipinos. And now it's Ramil \u2014 who once rejected rice \u2014 who's trying to keep her family's food traditions alive.\n\nShe started with lumpia, which she describes \"as an eggroll, but better.\" Her grandmother, Fausta Reyes Ramil, who lived to be 100, taught Ramil how to make the fried rolls, filled with pork and finely chopped vegetables, before she passed away. (Ramil also has a blog with her grandmother's journal entries, called Lola's Journals.)\n\nNow, Ramil is making sure the young people in her family know how to make the traditional dish.\n\n\"I would prepare my grandmother's lumpia recipe and kind of set up a lumpia sweatshop, if you will,\" Ramil says. \"For each of my cousins' children ... there are about 25 or 30 of them \u2014 I would put a place mat in front of them, lumpia wrappers ... a little bowl of raw meat.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Melanie Vanderlipe Ramil Courtesy of Melanie Vanderlipe Ramil\n\n\"It's a really neat time, because while they're rolling, I'll bring in my older cousins, my aunts and uncles, and all of them \u2014 they just love it,\" she says. \"We just all talk about stories of my grandmother cooking, our family. ... I just love the tradition.\"\n\nThe irony of being the champion of her family's culinary traditions isn't lost on Ramil. And while her mother didn't resist her request for Pasta Roni all those years ago, Ramil hopes that she'll handle a similar request differently.\n\n\"One day, if I'm a mom, and I hear my daughter say that, I might push back a little \u2014 and I hope I do.\"\n\nDo you have a family food tradition you're trying to preserve?

She Was At The Center Of Brown v. Board Of Education\n\nIn 1954, Linda Brown was the lead plaintiff in the U.S. Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision that outlawed segregated public schools for black and white students. Brown was 76.\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nA central figure in the momentous civil rights case Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka has died. Linda Brown was just a kid when her father tried to enroll her in a white elementary school. And a promise he made to her in 1951 led to a transformative U.S. Supreme Court decision three years later. Here's Frank Morris from member station KCUR.\n\nFRANK MORRIS, BYLINE: In the early 1950s, Linda Brown was a kid growing up in a racially mixed Topeka neighborhood just four blocks from Sumner Elementary School.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nLINDA BROWN: But when school time came, I would have to take this school bus and go clear across town. And then the white children that I played with in the neighborhood, they would go to this other school. And my parents tried to explain this to me, but I was too young at that time to understand.\n\nMORRIS: This is Brown speaking to NPR in 1973. Her mom, Leola Brown, told NPR that she and her husband Oliver Brown were faced with explaining racism and segregation to their perplexed little girl.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nLEOLA BROWN: But her daddy told her that he was going to try to his best to do something about it and see that that was done away with.\n\nMORRIS: After making this profound promise, Brown walked his daughter to the neighborhood school and tried to enroll her. The principal told him it couldn't be done.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nLEOLA BROWN: He came back home, and he was very disgusted. And together, he and the NAACP started a suit against the Board of Education.\n\nMORRIS: It was 1951. Junior and senior high schools in Topeka were already integrated.\n\nJANAI NELSON: The final frontier in desegregating public schools was at the elementary school level.\n\nMORRIS: Janai Nelson is with the NAACP's Legal Defense and Education Fund.\n\nNELSON: I think everyone knew that once we removed the barriers of segregation from public schools, from children, that that would forever change the course of how Americans interacted with one another, how they viewed each other, how they perceived the humanity of each other.\n\nMORRIS: Three years later, the case was before the U.S. Supreme Court combined with four others from around the country all lumped together under Brown's name.\n\nNELSON: Out of that, the name Brown, the surname Brown became synonymous with notions of equality.\n\nMORRIS: After the landmark ruling and the death of her father, Linda Brown moved back to Topeka, worked in early childhood education, traveled, promoting civil rights and played the piano in the church where her father had preached.\n\nCAROLYN WIMS-CAMPBELL: She was my sister in Christ.\n\nMORRIS: Carolyn Wims-Campbell knew Linda Brown nearly all of her life and not just as the face of desegregation.\n\nWIMS-CAMPBELL: She just wasn't that cute little girl. She was a woman that was caring, was spiritual, a loving person that'll be missed.\n\nMORRIS: Linda Brown died Sunday after a prolonged illness. She was 75.

Haffey/Getty Images Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images\n\nIn 2009, the former UCLA basketball star Ed O'Bannon took on the NCAA in a lawsuit that challenged the organization's ability to profit from the likenesses of college athletes in a video game. But as the case heated up, its stakes and scope began to sprawl, opening a can of worms that threatened to upend one of the bedrock principles of college sports: amateurism.\n\n\"I wanted ... to get the NCAA to at least admit that they were wrong in using former players likeness for profit, and that eventually branched off into current players owning their likeness and why they should,\" O'Bannon said to me on the Code Switch podcast. \"Then it branched off later into actual current players getting paid from the universities and from the NCAA \u2014 not only basketball and football, but all athletes. Men and women.\"\n\nThe NCAA will make $771 million from the NCAA men's basketball tournament this year. The coaches at the biggest basketball schools have average salaries of around $3 million. But most Americans are not on board with the idea that the men who play the games should be paid.\n\nThere is a racial split here: A majority of white people oppose paying college athletes while a majority of black people are in favor. As we learned on the podcast, racial resentment toward African-Americans is a very strong predictor of opposition to paying student-athletes. (And let's not forget the racial optics of the NBA's \"one-and-done rule,\" by which most of the very best pro basketball prospects must spend a year masquerading as undergraduates because the NBA bars them from entry until they're a year out of high school.)\n\nEkow Yankah, a law professor at Cardozo Law School in New York City (and a huge fan of University of Michigan sports), offered a somewhat counterintuitive take on all this in a New Yorker essay, \"Why N.C.A.A. Athletes Shouldn't Be Paid.\" Yankah believes the current system is unfair and rife with exploitation, but believes that paying college athletes would essentially just entrench that arrangement.\n\nBelow is an edited version of our conversation with him on the Code Switch podcast episode, \"The Madness of March.\"\n\nWalk us through what you think might happen if we paid college athletes.\n\nI think paying college athletes is almost certainly bad for the athletes, terrible for the universities and terrible for the sports they play. Other than that, it's a great idea. There's very little reason to think that a young athlete's life will be in any substantial way better if they become, so to speak, employees of the university.\n\nOf course, many of these young men are under tremendous financial difficulty. I understand that a good number of them come from backgrounds which are difficult or even impoverished, and I'm well-aware that the demands of big-time college sports, but almost all college sports, are so consuming that there seems something unfair about their having to balance these two projects.\n\nThe problem is that paying them doesn't help relieve that stress, paying them only makes it the case that that stress seems justified. Paying college athletes will almost certainly exacerbate a problem that has been going on for generations, where athletes of a certain number of sports are seen as ever more divided from the actual student body. They're seen as tangential. They're seen as not real students. And, indeed, given that they will then have to trade some of the minimal protections that they have as student-athletes in order to simply be employees of the university, at least in some capacity. It seems like a pretty raw deal. All of this, by the way, is in exchange for what it would actually be, for the vast majority of athletes, a remarkably small amount of money on the free market.\n\nYou're saying that the best players would get the most money, but most players would get a pittance, if it was not equalized.\n\nThe point is that it's awfully hard to project which kids will be superstars. So outside of the small number of \"can't-miss\" prospects, most kids will actually be paid on some scale that reflects the deep uncertainty about how good they'll be. And if we want to see what that looks like, we don't have to use our imagination. We can look at the minor leagues: minor league basketball, minor league baseball and minor league hockey. Most of these young people are working nonstop. Most of them are just as talented, if not more talented, than the vast majority of college athletes. Most of them are paid roughly what a Starbucks barista is paid. And in exchange for all that, they give up their opportunity to go to college, to pursue their dreams and to turn out to not be a 20 year-old superstar but maybe a 40 year-old functioning adult.\n\nYou say that there is a racial component to the way that people think about the minor league systems, and the prospect of paying student-athletes in men's basketball and football.\n\nOne thing I worry about is this argument that, \"Well, these students aren't really students, anyway. So let's just pay them.\" And I do think that has a racial component. It's not entirely racial, of course. Part of it is that people are well-aware and turned off by the huge financial incentive that the universities have.\n\nBut it's also true that there are a ton of different students on every college campus who are not straight-A math students. Somehow when we think about young black athletes and what they do, the sort of physical talent that they bring is not valued the same way that the ballerina's is or the chess player's is, or the musician's is \u2014 and I do find that worrying. I wonder why it is that these are multitalented people whose skills may not be at its highest in science class is so quickly dismissed.\n\nIt's very clear that the true developmental league of the NBA is currently college basketball. The true developmental league of the NFL is entirely college football. And, somehow, the answer seems to be, \"disconnect these students from education\" rather than, \"why don't we do what we do with other sports and set up a robust semi-pro league?\" One that would allow some students, those who are actually involved and engaged, to remain student-athletes and allow those for whom being a student-athlete has no part of their project to go on to do what they want to do.\n\nBut it seems like even with that system [where minor leagues for football and basketball exist alongside the traditional college system for those sports], there's still a lot of kids who have no illusions about the fact that that they're not going to go pro, who will go to college, who will try to make the most of their college experience and will still generate tons of revenue for those colleges while they personally struggle financially because they can't be paid. I'm just curious what happens to those kids.\n\nI think that's a great question, and it gets the heart of how complex and hard this is. If you're a student-athlete who comes to Michigan well-aware that you're never going to professional, then there's a real sense in my mind's eye that you will make the deal that makes being a student-athlete worth it. That is to say, that your education will actually be valuable to you in a way that matters. You'll be much less likely to be fooled or to trade on these fumes of dreams that allow school after school to give college athletes empty classes with no value that end up with empty degrees with no value.\n\nI am not interested in a bunch of young men who work for three or four years for a university making a minor league salary, which, if people actually looked at what that would be, is quite minimal. I'm interested in the next generation of doctors and lawyers and bankers. And in particular, for the sports that are dominated by African-American men, I'm deeply interested in the next generation of black doctors, black lawyers and black bankers, rather than kids who are seduced into trading that for making spending money from 18 to 22.", "keywords": ["minor", "think", "students", "paid", "athletes", "pay", "college", "studentathletes", "league", "paying", "basketball", "racial", "shouldnt"], "polarity": 0.07191494378017817, "subjectivity": 0.46825640505328014},

Joined on stage by punk icon Marky Ramone and the prolific jazz artist Ron Carter, and surrounded by a packed crowd of club owners, DJs, dance activists and city employees, de Blasio joked that the soon-to-be-appointed Night Mayor of New York is \"one of the coolest job titles you could ever hope to have.\" The Office of Nightlife and its advisory group will act as liaisons between various aspects of the nightlife industry and local communities, and are modeled after similar initiatives in London, Amsterdam and other European cities.\n\nDrafted by Brooklyn Council Member Rafael Espinal (D-37), a Bed-Stuy native first elected to the New York State Assembly at the age of 26 and currently in his first term as a council member, the bill is the first in a docket of legislation that aims to support the city's vibrant nightlife culture. De Blasio's signature was the culmination of advocacy that has spanned decades.\n\nBut there is one more bill, also from Espinal and also dealing with nightlife in the city \u2014 No. 1652 \u2014 to push through City Hall, with the potential to address a pernicious, racially motivated law that has followed \"fringe\" musical scenes in the city for nearly a century.\n\nWhen Mercedes Ellington, granddaughter of jazz great Duke, stood in front of the New York City Council last Thursday, it was to testify in support of No. 1652. Introduced by Espinal earlier this year, the proposal would repeal the so-called \"Cabaret Law,\" a New York City rule established in 1926 that disallows dancing in cabarets and public halls without a special license. \"The freedom to be beyond category, to explore and express, through music and dance, is our human responsibility,\" Ellington said. \"The current cabaret laws were designed to restrict, curtail and separate those freedoms.\"\n\nIn parallel to, and urged on by Espinal's presentation of these bills, outcry over the Cabaret Law has boiled over. At last week's hearing, Brooklyn nightclub owner John Barclay, a founder of the pro-repeal Dance Liberation Network, characterized the law as being \"absurd, antiquated, racist and extremely embarrassing for our city.\"\n\nFor anyone who likes to go out at night in New York City, whatever their musical pleasure, this Prohibition-era rule has long been a running, if not especially funny, joke. Signs reading \"NO DANCING\" still hang in barrooms throughout the city \u2014 and while the law's effect is paraphrased as making it \"illegal to dance\" in New York, that description is technically untrue. What is unlawful is for a New York City establishment to host dancing without the proper license from the Department of Consumer Affairs.\n\nThe current law, as explained on the City of New York's website, states that \"a place that is open to the public and sells food or drinks must have a Cabaret License to allow customers to dance.\" But according to nightlife professionals, obtaining this license is onerous, expensive and redundant, adding extra layers of paperwork to a process that already requires approval from the Department of Buildings, Fire Department, State Liquor Authority, Department of Health, commercial insurance companies and community boards, among other entities.\n\nIn a departure from past administrations, the one currently in office has pledged its unequivocal backing to the repeal. \"The Mayor strongly supports repealing the law, while retaining several security requirements key to the public's safety. We feel there are better ways than the current law to create a strong nightlife economy that doesn't endanger those involved,\" Ben Sarle, deputy press secretary for Mayor de Blasio, told NPR.\n\nNew York City's dance-music culture is especially thriving of late, and a number of key players in the scene have rallied hard for the law's repeal. Under the larger banner of Let NYC Dance, groups like Dance Liberation Network, Dance Parade, NYC Artist Coalition and others have mobilized their masses, uniting with representatives of multiple musical genres and social justice nonprofits. Council Member Espinal has connected with many of these groups, drafted progressive nightlife-related legislation and gained the support of the Mayor's office along the way.\n\nOn Dec. 7, 1926, at a meeting of the Municipal Assembly of the City of New York during which the Cabaret Law was decided upon, the minutes read: \"There has been altogether too much running 'wild' in some of these night clubs and, in the judgment of your Committee, the 'wild' stranger and the foolish native should have the check-rein applied a little bit. ... Your Committee believes that these 'wild' people should not be tumbling out of these resorts at six or seven o'clock in the morning to the scandal and annoyance of decent residents on their way to daily employment.\" It's widely understood that the Cabaret Law was written with the intent to impose control over black clubs in Harlem and impede miscegenation.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Bettmann/Getty Images Bettmann/Getty Images\n\nLast week's hearing was held in the same room as that assembly 90 years prior. (Surely the fashion in the current-day chambers tends more colorful \u2014 one speaker sported transparent, four-inch-tall platform boots and sky-blue hair.) In her testimony last week, Frankie Decaiza Hutchinson, a cofounder of the DJ collective Discwoman, promoter, booking agent and leader of Dance Liberation Network, posed a question both rhetorical and actual: \"Why are we hanging onto a law that has been used historically and systematically to oppress black folks and other marginalized communities?\"\n\nThe law, as it was originally written, inflicted strict curfews and specific rules upon a burgeoning jazz scene. No more than three musicians were allowed to play onstage without the venue securing the proper license, making most jazz bands verboten (that rule was declared unconstitutional in 1988). The \"cabaret card\" aspect of the law, which stood from the early '40s till 1967, demanded that all cabaret workers \u2014 from the bartender to the piano player \u2014 be fingerprinted, photographed and subject to a background check. The city capriciously revoked cards for bad behavior \u2014 Thelonious Monk and Billie Holiday were banned from gigging in NYC for periods of time because of minor drug offenses.\n\nHistorically, it wasn't just jazz that bore the brunt of the city's enforcements. News articles from the '60s detail the licensing struggles suffered by folk clubs in Greenwich Village, and the famed discotheques of the '70s and '80s often operated along the edges of legality. Following the Happy Land arson tragedy in 1990, policing stepped up at underground social clubs uptown.\n\nBut it was under Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's term where the weaponization of the law was most severe. Giuliani's MARCH (Multi-Agency Response to Community Hotspots) task force worked to squelch NYC's nightlife, in reaction to grisly reports of deaths and drugs in clubland. MARCH agents would patrol bars and clubs looking for infractions such as patrons moving their bodies to music; if the venue hadn't secured the proper cabaret license, it was cause for fines, and could lead to closure.\n\nDance-music aficionados and music-industry professionals have previously tried, and failed, to strike the law. Though Giuliani's Broken Windows tactics made the city safer, it also caused some of New York's cultural capital to drain away. \"There was a moment in the late '90s when electronic-music culture was emerging into the global mainstream,\" says Eric Demby, founder of the Brooklyn Flea and Smorgasburg, and a cofounder of Legalize Dancing NYC, a group formed around 1999. \"We were going to places like Berlin, Detroit, London and San Francisco, and everyone had this cool version of the dance-music scene. But we would come home to New York, the greatest city in the world, and the city was holding back the culture.\"\n\nAttempts to repeal the law floundered in City Hall in the mid-2000s; ultimately, it wasn't the right political moment, says Norman Siegel, a civil rights lawyer and former director of the NYCLU. In 2005, Siegel brought a case to NYS Supreme Court, to judicially challenge the Cabaret Law by arguing that expressive dancing is a constitutional right. He lost. Siegel still feels that the decision in that case was wrong. The Cabaret Law is \"bad for New York,\" he says. \"Every denial of expressive activity is a serious infringement. You can't give the government an inch because then they take a foot, then they take a yard, and you wake up one morning and you don't have expressive rights any more. Dancing is a fundamental civil right.\"\n\nThough no doubt significant, \"removing the cabaret license is first a symbolic gesture to right a historical wrong,\" says Espinal. Yet there is work to be done to fine-tune the bill, and properly communicate to the public exactly what the repeal will accomplish. \"It's good symbolism, and symbolism we agree with,\" says Rob Bookman, a lawyer, lobbyist and counsel for the NYC Hospitality Alliance, an industry group. But Bookman cautions that \"repealing the cabaret law will not increase by one space, by one place, where you can legally dance.\" (The only people who might resent the law's removal are the 104, at the time of this writing, establishments in NYC who already went through the arduous licensing process.)\n\ntoggle caption Jane Lerner\n\nNightclubs in NYC are severely limited by zoning restrictions and street-level quality of life concerns, and their existences remain contingent upon the approval of numerous state and city agencies. Indeed, if the Cabaret Law disappears, the city will continue to impose a serious set of rules on nightclub operators who host dance parties.\n\n\"Dancing equals security and surveillance,\" says Barclay, the bar owner. In fact, the language around security staff and surveillance cameras that exists in the current version of the Cabaret Law will remain in the city's administrative code. \"We don't have an issue with safety regulations,\" Barclay says, but he points out that 200 people dancing in a club legally requires more security measures than a group of 1,000 watching MMA fighting at a sports bar. The creation of the Office of Nightlife is intended to address and rectify such concerns.\n\nAfter decades of attempts by activists, lawyers, and industry groups, why is the city agreeing to this reformation? A more diverse and left-leaning city government is one factor, and the current crews of pro-dance advocates have been organized and relentless, actively inspired by the national political climate. \"We're all looking for a light and this was one that felt hopeful,\" Hutchinson tells NPR. \"Even if dancing in bars isn't the most pressing issue, it's still part of the same oppressive system.\" All the players admit that finishing off the Cabaret Law, once and for all, is the right move.\n\nCouncil Member Espinal sees this work as part of a larger political picture. \"At a time when we are discussing the removal of statues with repressive history, it would only make sense [to] support removing a historically discriminatory law,\" he says.\n\nJamie Burkart, a founding member of NYC Arts Coalition, agrees. \"This is a time where we need our community spaces more than ever,\" Burkart says. \"I feel confident in 2017 that our city leaders can stand up and say that a law that was created to discriminate, a law that we have the complete power to change, is not going to stand.\"", "keywords": ["cabaret", "nightlife", "city", "nyc", "law", "legitimizes", "repeal", "license", "dance", "york", "dancing", "verging"], "polarity": 0.07187777082355395, "subjectivity": 0.41021314696013494},
{"title": "FACT CHECK: 10 Statements From Trump's Phoenix Speech", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2017/08/23/545504933/fact-check-10-statements-from-trumps-phoenix-speech", "text": "FACT CHECK: 10 Statements From Trump's Phoenix Speech\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAt a campaign rally in Phoenix on Tuesday, President Trump made news by slamming Republican senators, praising controversial former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio and blasting the news media.\n\nHe also defended his initial, controversial remarks on recent violent protests in Charlottesville, Va. But in doing so, he left out the parts of the remarks that inflamed people's tempers the most, like his comment that there was violence \"on many sides.\"\n\nThat's just one of the misleading or untruthful things Trump said. We fact-checked 10 of his statements.\n\n1. Anti-Trump protesters\n\n\"And just so you know from the Secret Service, there aren't too many people outside protesting, OK? That I can tell you.\"\n\nIt's impossible to fact-check exactly what Trump knew about protesters \u2014 if Secret Service agents spoke to Trump about protesters or what agents told him, for example.\n\nBut we do have at least some context on this claim: Trump very likely did see some protesters on his way to the convention center where his rally was held. In a pool report, Washington Times reporter David Boyer wrote about the anti-Trump activists along the route as the presidential motorcade drove to the rally site:\n\n\"We saw a smattering of supporters holding Trump/Pence signs and waving in the neighborhood near the hotel. As we got closer to the convention center, we saw more and more protesters. Hard to judge how many, but there were several hundred that we passed. \"Several people made obscene gestures at the motorcade. Some signs included 'Fire Trump' and 'Sad!' Also, 'Love One Another.' \"\n\nHowever, it's also possible that Trump didn't get the full scope of how many protesters were there, according to NPR's Geoff Bennett, who was traveling with the president as well. The motorcade didn't drive by the area where the overwhelming majority of protesters were gathered, Bennett reports. Those protesters numbered in the \"thousands,\" as Fox News and the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\n2. Charlottesville statement\n\n\"I am really doing this to show you how dishonest these people are. Here is my first statement when I heard about Charlottesville. ... Here is what I said on Saturday:\n\n\" 'We're closely following the terrible events unfolding in Charlottesville, Va.' This is me speaking. 'We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence.' That's me speaking on Saturday, right after the event.\"\n\nThe key part here is this sentence: \"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence.\"\n\nTrump did say that, but he left out the second part of that sentence. The full sentence was: \"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides \u2014 on many sides\" (per a transcript from Vox).\n\nIt was that \"many sides\" part that angered many people \u2014 it appeared to put the KKK, neo-Nazi and other white supremacist rallygoers on the same moral footing as the counterprotesters who opposed them.\n\nHe made the comparison more than once in his responses to the events in Charlottesville. The Tuesday after the protest, he said:\n\n\"OK, what about the alt-left that came charging \u2014 excuse me. What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right? Do they have any semblance of guilt?\" he said in response to a reporter's question. He later added, \"You had some very bad people in that group. But you also had people that were very fine people on both sides.\"\n\n3. CNN ratings\n\n\"CNN, which is so sad, so pathetic, and their ratings are going down.\"\n\nEarly in August, CNN released new data showing that its ratings are healthy. According to the report:\n\n\"Year to date, 2017 is pacing to be CNN's highest on record in Total Day among total viewers and highest among 25-54 since 2003. 2017 is also pacing to be CNN's second largest audience since 2008 in primetime among 25-54 and total viewers.\"\n\nIn addition, Variety reported in June that CNN had its \"most-watched first quarter in 14 years.\"\n\nOf course, CNN isn't alone in getting these ratings boosts; all three major cable news networks \"saw double-digit ratings growth across the board for the second quarter of 2017,\" Variety also reported.\n\nTrump has made the claim before as part of his ongoing attacks on the media. He said CNN's ratings were down in July, too; PolitiFact likewise at the time found this to be \"flat wrong.\"\n\n4. \"Racism was evil\"\n\n\"I said racism was evil. Did they report that I said racism was evil? No.\"\n\nMultiple headlines from an array of news outlets reported that Trump called racism \"evil\" in his Aug. 14 address \u2014 in which he also called out the KKK and neo-Nazis specifically after political pressure to do so.\n\n5. New York Times \"apology\"\n\n\"The New York Times essentially apologized after I won the election because their coverage was so bad, and it was so wrong, and they were losing so many subscribers that they practically apologized. I would say they did. They say, 'Well it wasn't really that much of an apology because they were losing so many people because they were misled.' \"\n\nTrump has claimed multiple times that the Times \"apologized,\" though this time he seemed to back off slightly by saying it \"essentially\" apologized. Either way, the New York Times did not apologize, as NPR's Jessica Taylor wrote in a fact-check of a Jan. 29 Trump tweet.\n\n\"New York Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and executive editor Dean Baquet did write a letter to readers after the surprising election conclusion examining the paper's coverage. In the note, they acknowledged that 'after such an erratic and unpredictable election there are inevitable questions: Did Donald Trump's sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?' And a column from the paper's public editor (or ombudsman), Liz Spayd, pointed out problems with its data/forecasting vertical that predicted that Hillary Clinton had an 80 percent chance of winning the election. She also argued that the paper's reporters could have done a better job of tapping into 'the sentiments of Trump supporters.' \"However, neither of those pieces constitutes an apology.\"\n\nThe Times itself in a March 29 tweet responded to Trump: \"False, we did not apologize. We stand by our coverage & thank our millions of subscribers for supporting our journalism.\"\n\n6. Health insurance premiums\n\n\"Arizona is a disaster in terms of your price increase ... 116 percent.\"\n\nThis figure is correct. It comes from an October 2016 report from the Department of Health and Human Services. It found that among all states, Arizona would have the largest average premium hike in 2017, as measured by silver plans offered to 27-year-olds.\n\nBut when talking about Affordable Care Act premium increases, it's misleading to not also mention tax credits.\n\n\"The caveat is that most people don't feel that price hike because they're insulated by the tax credits under the Affordable Care Act,\" as Will Stone, from NPR station KJZZ in Tempe, told NPR in March.\n\nStone added that GOP efforts to overhaul health care would very likely have made the situation in Arizona worse.\n\n\"The Republican replacement ... would have lowered the tax credits relatively significantly for a place like Arizona.\"\n\n7. Job numbers\n\n\"Since I took the oath of office, we have added far more than 1 million jobs in the private sector. Unemployment is right now at almost a 17-year low.\"\n\nFrom February through July, U.S. firms have added 1,074,000 jobs, according to numbers from the Labor Department (with the caveat that those numbers are still subject to revision). That's solid growth, but it's not out of the norm for the last few years.\n\nAnd unemployment is 4.3 percent. The last time it was that low was May 2001, and the last time it was lower than that was February 2001 \u2014 so it has been 16 1/2 years since unemployment was lower than it is now.\n\n8. Economic growth\n\n\"Economic growth has surged to 2.6 percent. Remember, everybody said you will not bring it up to 1 percent.\"\n\nEconomic growth in the second quarter was indeed 2.6 percent, up from 1.2 percent in the first quarter. One can quibble with the word \"surged\" here, but 2.6 percent isn't at all an unusually high economic growth number. Economic growth is often around or above that level.\n\nBut as far as \"everybody\" saying that Trump wouldn't be able to boost economic growth above 1 percent, that's false. The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee in its December meeting, for example, projected 2.1 percent economic growth for 2017. Economic advisory firm IHS likewise projected that in 2017, growth would be above 2 percent \u2014 2.3 percent, to be exact.\n\nTrump himself has said he's aiming for even higher growth: 3 percent, to be exact (and that's down from a 4 percent prediction he had made before). Even sustained 3 percent growth is unlikely to happen, according to many economists.\n\n9. Increasing wages\n\n\"Wages are rising.\"\n\nWages are indeed rising, but not very quickly \u2014 in fact, considering the low unemployment rate, economists continue to wonder why they aren't rising faster.\n\n\"The mystery continues to be with the labour market this tight, and the level of improvement we continue to see, that wages stubbornly stay at 2% year-over-year wage growth. To me that continues to be the mystery of the jobs report,\" as Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, told the BBC after the July jobs report was released.\n\nIn the last jobs report, wage growth accelerated slightly, to 2.5 percent annually, as Bloomberg reported. That's a positive development, but wage growth can bounce around from month to month; if the upward movement becomes sustained, that will be a more promising sign. As CNN reported after the last jobs report, many economists would consider wage growth around 3 to 3.5 percent to be a better sign that the job market is healthy.\n\n10. Stock market highs\n\n\"The stock market is at its all-time high in history.\"\n\nTrump is right: The Dow Jones industrial average \u2014 one of the most closely watched stock indexes \u2014 has posted several record highs this year, passing the 22,000 mark in early August. The S&P 500, another popular index, has likewise hit multiple highs this year.\n\nAll stock index records come with the caveat that they are not adjusted for inflation. In addition, Trump can't really claim credit for that entire rally, as NPR's Jim Zarroli reported in July. While his policy agenda of deregulation and lower corporate taxes may have some in the business community feeling confident, low interest rates and faster global growth are also likely helping to push stocks higher.", "keywords": ["report", "economic", "check", "fact", "speech", "reported", "phoenix", "trumps", "protesters", "statements", "jobs", "2017", "trump", "thats", "times", "growth"], "polarity": 0.051950585844028466, "subjectivity": 0.4435372732913719},

And for state government coffers, the Republican-led overhaul may not cut as cleanly along ideological lines as Democrats say.\n\nMontana\n\nTake Montana, which Donald Trump won by 20 points. The state Legislature is dominated by Republicans who are championing the new federal tax law as nothing but good news for the state.\n\nBut Montana's governor, Democrat Steve Bullock, warns the tax changes could pose a threat to his state's finances.\n\n\"This is a bad deal for Montana and for families all across the country,\" Bullock wrote in a tweet soon after Congress passed the tax overhaul.\n\nThis month, the head of the governor's budgeting office announced the state could expect to lose $20 million in revenue over the next two years, mainly because of how the federal law changes the way Montana collects corporate income tax.\n\nAnd $20 million is on the low end of projections by state economists.\n\n\"With experts on both sides, we thought it appropriate to err on the side of less loss to state revenue, because that was really the legislative intent in Congress,\" Montana State Budget Director Dan Villa said. \"It was not the intent to have that implication come down on the state.\"\n\nMontana Senate Majority Leader Fred Thomas says the analysis by the governor's office is nothing but politics.\n\n\"We don't see any impact except positive impacts,\" Thomas said.\n\nThe Montana Legislature meets once every two years, and there are no plans to call a special session to deal with the disagreement over projections. Although, state lawmakers could be called back into session if consensus grows around a loss more than the governor's estimate of $20 million.\n\nNotably, the Montana Department of Revenue suggests it could be more than double that. Director Mike Kadas, a Bullock appointee, cites the fact that Montana is one of 17 states coupling their tax code with federal law in a way that could result in a loss in personal and corporate income tax.\n\nHow Blue States Are Making End Run Around New GOP Tax Law How Blue States Are Making End Run Around New GOP Tax Law Listen \u00b7 10:25 10:25\n\nMaryland\n\nMaryland is not one of those 17. The Mid-Atlantic, left-leaning state is expecting a windfall from the Republican-led update to the federal tax code.\n\nThe state comptroller's office expects a boost to state and local income tax revenue of at least $300 million in a single year, unless the state General Assembly acts to prevent it.\n\nMaryland's tax code is more directly coupled with the federal code, so Maryland taxpayers can take most of the same deductions on their federal and state tax returns.\n\n\"It's a very sensible choice that almost all states have made, basically to allow taxpayers who have calculated their taxes for the federal purposes just to take those same calculations, make just a couple of tweaks to figure out how much they owe the state,\" said Andrew Blair-Stanek, a tax specialist who teaches at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law.\n\nThis is intended to simplify the tax-filing process for residents, as well as enforcement for the state. But it also means taxpayers can only deduct something from their state taxes if they have already deducted it from their federal taxes.\n\nThe new federal law increases the standard deduction while limiting some previous deductions, such as the one for state and local taxes. As a result, roughly 700,000 Maryland residents who itemized deductions on their past tax returns will shrink their federal tax bills if they switch to the standard deduction, said Andrew Schaufele, director of the state Bureau of Revenue Estimates in the comptroller's office.\n\nBut if all 700,000 take the standard deduction on both their federal and state tax returns, the state is expected to collect about $483 million more.\n\nThe federal changes also reduce the personal exemption that taxpayers can claim on their income taxes to zero. Schaufele said it's unclear whether this would eliminate Maryland's personal exemption. If it does, state revenues stand to gain another $1.2 billion.\n\nFor states expecting a financial boost from the federal changes, \"in the short run, it could turn out to be a great thing,\" said Blair-Stanek. \"But over the long run, it will definitely increase the pressure on state and local governments to reduce taxes, or at least rein in increases.\"\n\nMaryland lawmakers have promised to pass legislation protecting taxpayers from the increases by the time the state's 90-day General Assembly session ends in April.\n\nGov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, said last week that he will introduce legislation allowing taxpayers to itemize deductions on their state returns even if they take the standard deduction on their federal returns.\n\n\"Under our proposed legislation, Marylanders will not pay one cent more in state taxes as a result of the actions at the federal level,\" he said.\n\nLeaders of the Democrat-controlled General Assembly are joining with Hogan to clarify the law and eliminate any risk to the state personal exemption \u2014 and at the same time seizing an opportunity to criticize congressional Republicans and Trump.\n\n\"It's an economic war between the red states against the blue states,\" said Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller.\n\nEven if so, the new federal tax code doesn't seem to be as accurate a weapon as feared.\n\nCorin Cates-Carney is Montana Public Radio's Capitol Bureau reporter.

Every so often NPR Host/Special Correspondent Michele Norris will dip into those six-word stories to explore issues surrounding race and cultural identity for Morning Edition.\n\n\"Where are you from?\"\n\nNational Geographic\n\n\"No, really, where are you from?\"\n\nThose questions about identity and appearance come up again and again in submissions to The Race Card Project. In some cases, Norris tells Morning Edition's Steve Inskeep, people say it feels accusatory \u2014 like, 'Do you really belong?'\n\nIt's also a question that Alex Sugiura, because of his racially ambiguous appearance, can't seem to escape.\n\nSugiura, 27, is the child of a first-generation Japanese immigrant father and a Jewish mother of Eastern European descent. Sugiura's brother Max looks more identifiably Asian, but when people meet Alex, they're often not satisfied to hear that he's from Brooklyn.\n\nSome people find this question accusatory, as if the person being asked doesn't quite belong. But Sugiura actually welcomes the question and the conversations that flow out of it \u2014 and he says he understands why people ask.\n\n\"I have always thought I've had a particularly strange face,\" he explains. \"I looked at my parents growing up and I didn't see their faces in my face \u2014 I did see some combination, some mixture.\" When he looked in the mirror, he says, he didn't see a \"typical American face.\"\n\nThat may be so, but Sugiura's face, along with his brother Max and other adults and children of mixed race, was recently highlighted in the October issue of National Geographic. \"The Changing Face of America\" examines the nation's growing number of multiracial people and how they choose to identify themselves.\n\nWhen Sugiura fills out question about race in the census form, he checks the box for Japanese. But in more casual situations, he self-identifies as American but says he's ethnically Jewish.\n\nAlex Sugiura considers the fluidity of racial and ethnic identity 3:57\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Martin Schoeller/National Geographic Martin Schoeller/National Geographic\n\nBut for as long as Sugiura can remember, he's been confused with someone of Latin American descent. It first happened when he was 6 or 7 years old, when someone began asking him questions in Spanish. \"And at that point, I had no faculty for the language and almost started crying cause I was just so terrified,\" he says.\n\nBut by age 11 he started to take Spanish classes. And while he'd already been taking Japanese language and cultural classes for years, he found he enjoyed Spanish much more.\n\n\"It was a passing fancy at first, this idea [that] by people jokingly or mistakenly identifying me as Hispanic. ... I thought there was some kind of safe space there, you might say \u2014 that I was given a kind of fictional persona,\" Sugiura says. \"I would say it propelled me forward and I feel very much like my own man through the Spanish language.\"\n\ntoggle caption Courtesy of the Sugiura Family\n\nThere's another interesting wrinkle in Sugiura's thoughts on the intersection of race and appearance, Norris says, noting that this particularly sensitive subject was a bit tough for Sugiura to talk about. \"He says that his height, his deep voice, his Type A personality, his sort of, big physical presence, has helped him sidestep ... some of the more painful, offensive stereotypes that are too often attached to Asian men.\"\n\nSugiura bristles at those stereotypes, and yet, he notes that his father \"did us a great favor by marrying our mother. ... They made two tall, loud boys.\"\n\n\"When you're a typical, you know, shorter, soft-spoken Asian male, you are perceived almost to be weaker or lacking the fiber of what an American leader is supposed to be,\" he says.\n\nThe Sugiura family's appearance raises questions in the American South 1:46\n\nSugiura says this all goes back to the reason that he welcomes this question, \"Where are you really from?\" He sees that question as an opening to make the point that there are many different ways to be Asian, Jewish, white or even a New Yorker. \"And he has a chance to make that point,\" Norris explains, \"if he actually gets to participate in those conversations.\"\n\nAnd, Sugiura notes, this question about where you come from can lead to some very unexpected conversations \u2014 like one his family experienced on a stop at a gas station in the American South. An older white man behind the counter asked his father, \"Where are you from, boy?\"\n\nAnd while the question felt laden with tension, the outcome of the encounter surprised everyone.

Police said at the time they believed it was a gun.\n\n\"They didn't have to kill him like that. They didn't have to shoot him that many times,\" she sobbed, as Clark's uncle, Kurtis Gordon, wiped tears from her face.\n\n\"Why didn't you shoot him in the arm? Shoot him in the leg? Send the dogs? Send the Taser? Why?\" she asked.\n\nCivil rights attorney Benjamin Crump is representing the family in the case and cradled Thompson as she wept on his shoulder.\n\nIn recent years, Crump has handled several high-profile officer-involved shooting cases, including Tamir Rice and Michael Brown.\n\nCrump drew comparisons between the Sacramento police officers' response when dealing with Clark, a black suspect, and that of law enforcement in other cities pursuing white suspects.\n\nThe Florida high school shooter who allegedly killed 17 people last month before he was apprehended, \"was not shot once. But a young black man holding a cellphone is shot 20 times,\" he said. \"Young man who was bombing homes in Austin, [Texas], the police followed him for hours. He wasn't shot once. But an unarmed black man holding a cellphone is shot 20 times.\"\n\n\"We will stand up for Stephon, we will speak up for Stephon ... until we get justice,\" he added.\n\nCrump said the family is calling for policy changes within the police department, including implicit bias training. They also want to prohibit officers from muting body camera audio, which the policeman involved in the shooting did after killing Clark.\n\nAdditionally, Crump said, Clark's family has commissioned an independent autopsy.\n\nAlice Huffman and Betty Williams of the NAACP were among nearly a dozen African-American community leaders standing with Clark's family Monday.\n\nAfter the press conference, Huffman told The Sacramento Bee that efforts by the NAACP to reach Sacramento County District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert had gone unanswered but that the organization is in talks with the U.S. Justice Department's Civil Rights Division about investigating the shooting at the federal level.\n\nShelly Orio, a spokeswoman with the district attorney's office, told NPR that members of Schubert's office are in the process of setting up a meeting with Williams sometime in the near future.\n\n\"The meeting being scheduled with the NAACP is at their request, so we are not sure what they would like to discuss,\" Orio said in an email. She also added, \"The Sacramento County District Attorney's Office reviews all officer-involved shootings that occur in the county which result in injury or death.\"\n\nActivists and protesters have been demonstrating in the days since footage of the killing was released last week. A day after the videos went viral Black Lives Matter led a march that spilled onto Interstate 5, shutting down traffic in both directions during rush hour.\n\nAs NPR reported, over the weekend protesters merged with the March for Our Lives event against gun violence on school campuses.

He was 76.\n\nPayne's son Jamal told Newsday that the retired journalist was working on a book about Malcom X when he had a heart attack in his home office Monday evening.\n\nOver nearly four decades, Payne, who was born in the Jim Crow South, proudly talked about his career in journalism as a calling \u2014 and a mandate to bring about social change.\n\n\"Being born in Alabama under an apartheid system,\" he said in an interview with Newsday, \"my whole life \u2014 in my professional life and career \u2014 has been about improving conditions for African Americans in this country.\"\n\nPayne's aim was to always be provocative, he said: \"I saw myself as a kind of lead pipe in the hands of people who did not otherwise have a weapon to counter such things.\"\n\nAnd he was revered for his ability to wield that weapon effectively.\n\n\"When he walked into a room, you knew he was going to bring the fire,\" Vanessa Williams told NPR.\n\nWilliams is a staff writer at The Washington Post who also served as president of the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ), an organization Payne co-founded and later led.\n\n\"For someone who worked in a newsroom where there weren't a lot of black journalists, it was inspiring to be in the same organization with someone like him,\" she said.\n\nAs an investigative reporter, Payne went undercover for a week working alongside migrant potato farm laborers on Long Island, chronicling their \"their despairs, laughs and loves and cries.\"\n\nIn a story about biased housing policies in Long Island during the 1970s, Payne described the look on his landlady's face when she realized she'd rented an apartment to a black man: \"When she opened the door I saw the look that I have seen often on the face of my white countrymen. It was the look of rejection, hatred, scorn, dread, contempt, pale ire, even fear. There was no mistaking it.\"\n\nPayne also covered the forced sterilization of American black women; U.S. atomic testing in Nevada; the Black Panther Party; and the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nBut it was a 33-part series called \"The Heroin Trail,\" tracing how heroin produced from poppies cultivated in Turkey eventually found its way onto the streets of Long Island, that won Payne and two other reporters a Pulitzer for public service, in 1974.\n\nIt was a sprawling and audacious undertaking for the paper as it was moving into foreign coverage, making a direct connection between U.S. foreign policy and aid to the 25 heroin overdose victims who died that year in the same community the paper covered.\n\nDespite the prestigious accolade, it was another story that became a turning point for Payne. \"My career defining moment would be covering South Africa,\" he said in the Newsday interview.\n\nBecause of his childhood experiences in Alabama, Payne said, \"I knew about segregation. I knew a good deal about racism. But that kind of brutal, barbarian kind of racism was an eye-opener even for me.\"\n\nThe series documented the killings by the apartheid government during the Soweto uprising and found they had been vastly under-reported. Officials admitted to killing 250 students, but Payne determined 850 had been slain in the upheaval.\n\n\"He always said, 'You have to count the bodies,' \" Nick Charles, a former colleague of Payne's, told NPR.\n\nIn that instance, Charles said, Payne found sources within a handful of black-led community groups who would not confirm the number of dead \u2014 but they did allow Payne to actually count the embalmed bodies.\n\n\"Les was fearless. He took big risks, sometimes life-taking risks,\" Charles said, adding that Payne was expelled and barred from entering South Africa again after the series ran.\n\nThe Soweto stories technically earned Payne another Pulitzer for international reporting. But in an unusual move, the advisory board overturned the jury's selection without explanation, handing it over to the fourth place finalist. It would have been Payne's second Pulitzer, which at the time was unprecedented for any reporter.\n\nPayne was born in Tuscaloosa, Ala., but he moved to Connecticut with his mother when she remarried. He finished high school two years early and graduated from the University of Connecticut in 1964 with a bachelor's degree in English. He entered the U.S. Army immediately afterward, and over six years rose through the ranks to captain during the Vietnam War, even writing speeches for Gen. William C. Westmoreland, according to The New York Times.\n\nPayne's career at Newsday spanned from 1969 to 2006, serving as associate managing editor by the end. He oversaw foreign and national coverage, including several Pulitzer nominated series, and became editor of New York Newsday while also writing a column. He retired in 2006.\n\nAs he transitioned from reporter to columnist, Payne said, he decided that he \"wanted to write a provocative column that would describe and find racism on Long Island.\"\n\n\"You looked up to him and wanted to be him \u2014 but you also got the sense that it was really hard being him,\" Charles said of Payne, whom he described as a renaissance man who didn't suffer fools. Still, he maintained an open-door policy for any young journalist seeking advice.\n\nCharles notes that NABJ was intended to provide camaraderie for black journalists who were often the lone minority reporters in newsrooms.\n\n\"But NABJ gave birth to other similar organizations, including the National Association of Hispanic Journalists and the National Association of Asian Journalists,\" he said.\n\nCharles recalled a favorite piece of advice Payne offered struggling reporters: \"Tell the truth and duck.\"\n\nIn 2017, Payne was inducted into the Deadline Club's Hall of Fame.\n\n\"Les is a champion of strong journalism and we were fortunate to have him as our leader at Newsday for many years. His passion for uncovering the truth no matter how difficult is an inspiration to us all,\" Newsday co-publisher Debby Krenek said at the time.\n\nPayne is survived by his wife, Violet, sons Jamal and Haile, and daughter Tamara.\n\n\"He appreciated the people who appreciated him: the readers. They were the ones that he enjoyed writing for, and I appreciate them reading him,\" Violet, told Newsday.", "keywords": ["told", "journalists", "payne", "series", "prizewinner", "black", "national", "newsday", "nabj", "dies", "pulitzer", "76", "les", "founder", "career"], "polarity": 0.06777708592777087, "subjectivity": 0.3951473640514736},

But he's also been stymied by Congress and by the courts.\n\nHere's a look at what the Trump White House has accomplished on each of those 10 promises \u2014 and what it hasn't.\n\n1. \"We will build a great wall along the southern border. And Mexico will pay for the wall.\"\n\nThe border wall remains more aspiration than reality. The Department of Homeland Security is waiving environmental rules to speed up construction of prototypes near San Diego.\n\nBut so far, Mexico has balked at paying for the wall. And so has Congress. The House has appropriated nearly $1.6 billion for the first phase of construction, but the Senate hasn't.\n\n2. \"We are going to end catch and release.\"\n\nAdministration officials say they're following through on Trump's promise to end so-called catch and release. That's how many critics describe the policy that allowed many immigrants to go free until their court dates, which can often be years away because of court backlogs.\n\nIn practice, it's not clear that the Trump administration is handling these cases much differently than previous administrations did.\n\nBut there has been a dramatic drop in the number of people apprehended at the Southwest border since Trump took office \u2014 a 46 percent drop during the first seven months of the year compared to 2016, according to a DHS official. The total for March was the lowest in at least 17 years, although the numbers have started to creep back up since then.\n\n3. \"Zero tolerance for criminal aliens.\"\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests are up more than 43 percent since late January compared to the same period in 2016, according to a DHS official. \"We are still continuing to prioritize our resources on those individuals that create and pose the greatest public safety and national security threat,\" the official said. Seventy-two percent of those arrested had criminal convictions, a much lower percentage than the final years of the Obama administration.\n\nTrump has pushed Congress for funding to hire more agents for ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. But like funding for the border wall, Congress has yet to sign off.\n\n4. \"Block funding for sanctuary cities.\"\n\nThe Justice Department is trying to follow through on that promise to punish so-called sanctuary cities, which limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. DOJ made some law enforcement grants contingent on whether those cities do more to help ICE.\n\nBut Chicago and California quickly took the administration to court. That's in addition to lawsuits filed earlier this year by San Francisco, Seattle and other self-described sanctuary cities.\n\n5. \"Cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce all immigration laws.\"\n\nThis probably refers to two Obama-era executive actions including DACA, which protects undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children from deportation.\n\nThe Trump White House dropped its support for a related program called DAPA, which was supposed to help the parents of those children.\n\nBut so far, the White House has allowed DACA to continue, much to the dismay of immigration hard-liners. Texas and other states are threatening to sue if the administration doesn't pull its support for DACA by Sept. 5.\n\n6. \"We are going to suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur.\"\n\nThis is part of what Trump's travel ban executive order was supposed to do.\n\nThe order Trump signed just a week after taking office would have blocked travelers from seven mostly Muslim countries that the administration says are known havens for terrorists.\n\nFederal courts put the original order on hold. But the Supreme Court allowed a limited version of the travel ban to take effect until it can hear legal challenges to the ban in the fall.\n\n7. \"We will ensure that other countries take their people back when we order them deported.\"\n\nTrump pointed out in Phoenix last year that immigrants with criminal records can wind up staying in the U.S. because their home country won't take them back. The White House has reportedly cut the number of non-cooperative countries from 23 to 12. Immigration hawks say that's a big win, and that the administration deserves more credit for it.\n\n8. \"We will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system which we need desperately.\"\n\nFor years, Congress has required the Department of Homeland Security to create a system to track everyone who comes in and out of the country using biometric technologies like facial recognition or fingerprint scanners.\n\nIn recent years, a majority of new undocumented immigrants have overstayed temporary visas, while the number crossing the border illegally has fallen.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection is testing a few prototype systems at U.S. airports this summer. But experts say a comprehensive solution that will work at more than 300 land, sea and air ports of entry remains a long way off.\n\n9. \"We will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet.\"\n\nIn the spring, Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to \"Buy American\" and \"Hire American,\" and urging others to do the same.\n\nBut critics point out that Trump's own companies continue to hire foreign guest workers and manufacture overseas. And just as the White House's \"Made in America\" week was underway in July, the administration announced it would allow an additional 15,000 temporary foreign workers.\n\n10. \"We will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers, the forgotten people.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the White House threw its support behind the RAISE Act, which would prioritize immigrants with valuable skills and high-paying U.S. job offers, and gradually reduce the number of other foreign nationals who can reunite with their families already living in the U.S. But there seems to be little enthusiasm for the bill in the Senate.", "keywords": ["check", "fact", "order", "white", "president", "fight", "administration", "congress", "wall", "immigration", "illegal", "trump", "immigrants", "house", "border"], "polarity": 0.059213277253049985, "subjectivity": 0.36531139315230216},

Every so often NPR Host/Special Correspondent Michele Norris will dip into those six-word stories to explore issues surrounding race and cultural identity for Morning Edition.\n\nAgain and again, The Race Card Project receives submissions dealing with mixed-race identity; from a child of a mixed-race union, from a parent of mixed-race children or from someone who is trying to figure out how to identify a mixed-race student or colleague, for example.\n\nThose kinds of stories are the largest single category of six-word submissions the Race Card Project receives, says Michele Norris, who curates the project. Many of these entries have a lot to do with labels and identity.\n\nWilma Stordahl, a Seattle resident who's an account manager for a national landscape company, offered one such submission: \"Norwegian with Nappy Hair Doesn't Fit.\"\n\n'What Are They?'\n\nStordahl is Norwegian, and she and her husband are both white. Together they have a 15-year-old white son, but she also has two older sons, Kevin Stordahl, 25, and Kazon Stordahl, 19, who both have a black father.\n\nWilma Stordahl gave them her last name in part because she wanted to make sure they had had a very specific and highly identifiable link to her family heritage.\n\n\"Typically, we think of Norwegians as being tall and blond and blue-eyed,\" Stordahl says. \"And my sons are tall \u2014 but they're not blond and blue-eyed.\"\n\nWhen the boys travel around with their tall, blonde mother, Stordahl says they draw quizzical stares and even questions from strangers.\n\n\"They'll usually lean in and quietly say, 'What are they?' And what they really want to ask is, 'What race are they?' \"\n\nStordahl typically answers with \"handsome,\" but she knows it's also more complicated than her tongue-in-cheek answer.\n\n\"In my 20s, I wanted to call them mixed-race. I wanted to say that they were some other thing, some other category than what was listed on all the forms that you fill out,\" Stordahl explains. \"But I was repeatedly corrected, and actually, I was most frequently corrected by African Americans.\"\n\nThey would tell her, \" 'No, honey \u2014 your son is black,' \" she says. \"Like, just get used to it, because that's how the world's gonna see them.\"\n\nStordahl did get used to those conversations, but she also wishes that people would move away from what she considers instinctive labeling of people based just on skin color or appearance \u2014 especially as more children are born of mixed-race couplings.\n\nNot Mixed-Race, But Mixed-Heritage\n\nWhen her son Kazon is asked these kinds of questions, he prefers to answer that he's mixed-race and leave it at that, Stordahl explains. But Kevin, she says, rejects that label for something more precise; he prefers the term \"mixed-heritage.\"\n\n\"He is rebelling against that idea that he's not just black and he's not just white,\" Stordahl says. \"He's of mixed-heritage. There's all these other customs and traits and things like that that also come with heritage.\"\n\nKevin, a sociology major who wants to focus on the study of mixed-race identity, has also taken a keen interest in his Norwegian background, pursuing Scandinavian studies in college and studying Norwegian.\n\nHis mother is thrilled, but she also has some concerns. \"There's another part of me that has a little bit of maybe guilt, that perhaps if it wasn't that he was of mixed-heritage, that perhaps he would be spending his time pursing something that would produce a more lucrative career,\" she says.\n\n\"I worry that perhaps he's ended up spending all of his energy and time and tuition on this question of identity \u2014 and maybe that he's searching for something within himself.\"\n\nBut, she says, Kevin assures her this is the path that makes him happy, \"so I'm gonna leave it at that.\"\n\nStordahl knows that when people look at her tall, brown-skinned boys \u2014 now young men \u2014 that they might not immediately recognize their Norwegian heritage. That makes her sad, but she also knows that if people take the time to really look hard at them, the Stordahl family is there, in their height and in their faces.\n\n\"I often have joked that my sons don't look a whole lot like me,\" Stordahl says. \"But in fact ... we all have the same eyes. Not the color, but the shape. They're all tall, like me \u2014 they're actually taller than me now.\n\n\"They are a part of me, and I a part of them.

But what do the players get? Supposedly, a free education. It's a perennial debate. Should we pay student athletes? But let's look at this debate through another lens. Those student athletes, particularly the ones on the best teams - many of them are black. But the coaches who train them, the schools they attend, the audience who watches - mostly white. It's a dynamic that raises all sorts of questions about big-time college sports, race and fairness. NPR's Gene Demby and the Code Switch team tackled this in a recent podcast. And he's come on the program to talk about it. Welcome.\n\nGENE DEMBY, BYLINE: Hey, Lulu.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So, Gene, let's start by looking at the money involved in big-time college sports. You looked specifically at the Power Five.\n\nDEMBY: Yup, the Power Five conferences - the SEC, the Big Ten, the Big 12, the Pac-12, and the ACC. They win all the trophies, and they make all the money. According to ESPN, in 2015, they made $6 billion.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Six billion?\n\nDEMBY: Billion with a B. And they have their own cable channels. I mean, they're major sports players. And almost all that revenue comes from two sports, men's basketball and football.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So where does all of that money go?\n\nDEMBY: Not to the student athletes. Under NCAA rules, they're amateurs. They cannot be compensated beyond their scholarships and the cost of attending college. But it goes to coaches' salaries. It goes to facilities. It goes to the conference commissioners who all make an excess of $2 million now. There are a lot of people who are millionaires because of these sports. And so everyone gets paid except for the student athletes.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So how does race factor into all of this?\n\nDEMBY: I mean, race is all throughout this conversation in the way people think about it and who the actual players are literally in this case. So Shaun Harper, who is a scholar on diversity in higher education at USC, said that, you know, many of the schools in the Power Five were either officially or effectively segregated for most of their histories. And that has really tangible consequences for the way campus life looks. And so these are conceived as white spaces. Their fan bases are white. Their alumni bases are white. Their cultural spaces are white. And so black students will be players in football and basketball. They'll be on the court and the field but they won't be in the stands.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So you're saying black people will be players. What do those demographics look like?\n\nDEMBY: So most of the players in the money sports, in football and basketball at the Power Five schools, are black. So 56 percent of the basketball players - men's basketball players - are black. Fifty-five percent of the football players are black. But 2.4 percent of the students at these schools are black men. And so this is -\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Only?\n\nDEMBY: Only 2.4 percent. I know. That was shocking to us, too. But there's this weird paradox that happens, right? So you have black men on these campuses who are basically invisible in the classrooms. But at any given time and during any given academic year, the most high-profile undergraduate at one of these universities is likely to be a black basketball phenom or a black football star.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: What did you find out about if these stars are actually getting the education that they've been promised?\n\nDEMBY: So Shaun Harper, the diversity expert from USC we were just talking about, crunched these numbers. And he found that at the Power Five schools, almost half of the black students in these two revenue-generating sports are not graduating from college. You'd almost be - you'd be better off actually being a black male student who was not on one of these teams. And that's important because the NCAA and supporters of not paying these athletes often talk about - that student athletes are more likely to graduate from college. And that might be true for some students, but it's not true for black male athletes.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So why? What's keeping them from graduating?\n\nDEMBY: We've talked to a bunch of people who talked about how hard being a student athlete is. People are dedicating 40 to 50 hours a week officially, you know, to being student athletes, to going to practice, to training. And then after they've done all those things, they have to go to class. They have to still be students. And, you know, they're often shuttered into classes that are maybe not the majors they want to be because those classes don't align with when their football and basketball schedules are. And so they're not graduating from college, and part of that is because the incentive structure is set up for the schools to value them as athletes before they value them as students.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So, obviously, there is divided opinions about whether or not student athletes should be paid. Do we know anything about how these opinions break down?\n\nDEMBY: Most Americans do not want to pay student athletes, but there is a big racial split. Sixty percent of white people are opposed to paying student athletes. That's according to The Washington Post and ABC News poll from last fall - while a small majority, about 54 percent of African-Americans, want them to be paid.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Have there been any studies looking at why certain groups are responding in certain ways?\n\nDEMBY: So there was a study done last year by some researchers at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst that looked at whether racial resentment was informing how people answer this question. And they found that the strongest indicator for opposition to compensating student athletes among white people - the strongest indicator was racial resentment towards African Americans. And there's a way that these sports are racialized because the most high-profile college athletes in these sports are black players.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Gene Demby, the lead blogger of NPR's Code Switch, thank you so much.\n\nDEMBY: Thank you so much, Lulu.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

The officer in the helicopter spots Clark running and walking through backyards, and tells officers on the ground that the suspect has just used a \"toolbar\" to break the window of a residence.\n\nWith direction from the helicopter officer, the officers on the ground follow and confront Clark.\n\nIn a dark backyard lit only by what appear to be gun-mounted flashlights, the officers' body camera footage shows what happened next.\n\nSacramento Police Department YouTube\n\nSacramento Police Department YouTube\n\n\"Show me your hands \u2014 gun!\" the first officer yells. A few short seconds later he yells, \"Show me your hands! Gun! Gun! Gun!\"\n\nThe second officer begins firing multiple shots. Then the first officer begins firing, too \u2014 they fire about 20 shots in all.\n\nHidden by tall grass and the darkness, Clark's body isn't visible, but there are no signs of movement.\n\nThe first officer yells again, \"Show me your hands!\" and the other adds, \"Let's see your hands.\"\n\n\"He's down, no movement,\" the second officer tells the dispatch. \"We're going to need additional units.\"\n\n\"You all right, you hit?\" says one officer. \"Yeah, I'm good,\" the other officer replies.\n\nThe first officer reloads his weapon.\n\n\"He's still down, he's not moving,\" the officer says. \"We can't see the gun.\"\n\nBackup units arrive on the scene.\n\n\"He came up, and he kind of approached us, hands out, and then fell down,\" the first officer tells one of the new arrivals.\n\nThe two officers who fired their weapons continue to hang back, holding position, occasionally yelling that they need to see Clark's hands.\n\nThe second officer tells someone that the suspect had \"something in his hands, looked like a gun from our perspective.\"\n\nFor more than five minutes, the two officers are seen standing behind the corner of the house with their weapons drawn.\n\nWhen they finally approach the man they shot, one of the officers handcuffs Clark's lifeless body.\n\n\"We're going to need CPR stuff,\" he says. The officers put on gloves and talk about going to get a rescue mask.\n\nThen officer one says \"Hey, mute?\" and the video's sound clicks off. The last two minutes of the video are silent.\n\nThe two officers involved in the shooting have been placed on paid administrative leave. The officers have been with the department for two and four years, respectively; both had four years' prior law enforcement experience with other agencies before joining the Sacramento force.\n\nThe Bee reports that before police released the videos to the public, they first showed them to Clark's family:\n\n\"Allowing family to see such videos before they are released to the public is part of a city policy adopted in late 2016 by the city of Sacramento after the fatal shooting by police of Joseph Mann, a mentally ill black man. Mann's shooting led to major reforms in the department, including a requirement that all patrol officers wear body cameras. \"The reforms also require police to release videos in 'critical incidents' such as officer-involved shootings and deaths in custody within 30 days of the event. Sacramento police Chief Daniel Hahn, the city's first African American chief, has been releasing videos more quickly than the requirement and for a broader range of events than covered by the new law since taking over the department last summer.\"\n\nThe videos of the last minutes of Clark's life have sparked questions in Sacramento and online, about how the police handled the situation \u2014 and how they might have thought Clark had a gun.\n\n\"The object ultimately determined to be what police saw in Clark's hand was a cellphone his girlfriend and mother of his two children, Salena Manni, had loaned him,\" the Bee reports. \"It was in a rose gold-colored case with a black clip on the back for holding items like credit cards, she said.\"\n\nThere is also a debate over what possible repercussions the two police officers might face.\n\nSacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg released a statement on Wednesday evening.\n\n\"I viewed the videos carefully,\" he said. \"Based on the videos alone, I cannot second guess the split-second decisions of our officers and I'm not going to do that.\"\n\n\"The questions raised by the community and councilmembers are appropriate and must be answered during the investigation,\" he continued. \"For instance, what are the protocols regarding use of force and for rendering emergency aid during officer involved shootings?\"\n\nSacramento police say additional video and audio will be released soon.\n\n\"This is an unfortunate moment,\" community activist Berry Accius told the Bee. \"This moment is probably going to set us back. ... We got transparency. Now we need accountability. We can't get that young man back.\"", "keywords": ["department", "backyard", "video", "unarmed", "man", "black", "officer", "shooting", "officers", "shows", "sacramento", "hands", "videos", "clarks", "grandparents"], "polarity": 0.02895437895437895, "subjectivity": 0.37578810078810077},

People are dumping it in RECORD numbers.\"\n\nThere's evidence that ESPN is not losing subscribers because of its politics. And it is very unusual for a White House to use the bully pulpit to call for the firing of someone at a private company because that person said something it didn't like. (An anti-Trump superPAC has brought an ethics complaint against Sanders, citing federal law that states executive branch employees cannot act \"with the intent to influence, solely on the basis of partisan political affiliation, an employment decision or employment practice of any private entity.\")\n\nBut conservatives and some journalists even within the network have been unsettled by what they see as an increasingly liberal bent from the network's commentators without balancing their perspectives.\n\nHill, who plays a dual role of host and commentator, has not been fired or suspended for her tweets. (In other tweets, she called Trump a bigot who is \"unqualified and unfit to be president.\")\n\nThe network said Hill's comments were inappropriate and that it had talked to her. Hill put out a statement via Twitter apologizing \u2014 not for the content of the tweets but for their being seen as a reflection of ESPN.\n\nThe network's public editor, Jim Brady, wrote Friday that he thought the tweets were ill-considered. For those who believe Twitter and the broadcast are separate, Brady points out that ESPN doesn't view it that way. As at other networks, public-facing employees' Twitter feeds are considered reflective of the company they work for. And plenty of people have been fired for inflammatory comments on the medium.\n\nThe irony isn't lost that the president is one person who hasn't been punished for his own incendiary tweets.\n\nLacking \"diversity of thought\"?\n\nBrady sees what happened as a bigger problem at ESPN. \"If you consume as much of ESPN's content as I have for the past 22 months, it seems clear the company leans left,\" he added. \"I don't think anyone ever made an executive decision to go that route as much as the personalities the network has promoted into high-profile positions tend to be more liberal, and as their voices are amplified, the overall voice has shifted with it.\"\n\nESPN veteran Bob Ley, host of the vaunted Outside the Lines program, told Brady in December, when Brady was exploring how ESPN was trying to adapt to current social and political upheaval, \"We've done a great job of diversity. But the one place we have miles to go is diversity of thought.\"\n\nNot too long ago, ESPN was facing criticism for its lack of diversity. There weren't very many female anchors or people of color in front of the camera. And there certainly weren't many black women on the air in prominent positions.\n\nSo the network set out to change that. Hill's show, SC6, also known on the network as The Six, was part of that change. She hosts the show with Michael Smith, a former Boston Globe reporter, who is also black.\n\nThe show is different \u2014 intentionally so. It's not the standard SportsCenter of highlights mixed in with anchor quips. Smith and Hill have a natural chemistry, express their opinions and mix in pop culture. That's what ESPN wanted, and it knew what it was getting with Hill. She's not someone in the traditional journalism mold; she has opinions, writes about them and expresses them on-air sometimes while questioning professional athletes on her program or reacting to what she just heard.\n\nShe has never shied away from sharing her perspectives. And, yes, that includes on race. That has also gotten her in trouble before. ESPN suspended her in 2008 for writing that \"rooting for the Celtics is like saying Hitler was a victim. It's like hoping Gorbachev would get to the blinking red button before Reagan.\"\n\nHill, a Detroit native, wrote of her hatred of Boston: \"Admittedly, to some degree it was about race. Detroit is 80 percent African-American, and as my colleague J.A. Adande stated in a fantastic piece on the Celtics earlier this season, the mostly white Celtics teams of the past had a tough time being accepted by black audiences. Boston was viewed by African-Americans as a racially intolerant city.\"\n\nShe apologized then, writing, \"I let you down. Just because I'm a black woman doesn't mean I've got an automatic sensitivity chip for cultures outside of my own. Just because I've written extensively about race doesn't render me incapable of making the same mistakes as the people I've written about.\"\n\nAlmost a decade later, Hill is in hot water again for expressing a view felt by others, especially African-Americans.\n\nDouble standards\n\nConservatives, though, see the seeming slap on the wrist for Hill in this latest controversy as a double standard. They point to, as one example of ESPN's inconsistency, Curt Schilling. The former Red Sox pitcher was fired last year as an analyst at ESPN for social media comments he made against transgender people.\n\n\"A man is a man no matter what they call themselves,\" Schilling wrote. \"I don't care what they are, who they sleep with, the men's room was designed for penis, women's not so much. Now you need laws telling us differently? Pathetic.\"\n\nThat was accompanied by a meme showing an overweight man dressed in women's clothing, a wig and a shirt that showed his chest with the words: \"LET HIM IN! to the restroom with your daughter or else you're a narrow-minded, judgmental, unloving racist bigot who needs to die.\"\n\nESPN responded in that case by saying it was an \"inclusive company\" and fired Schilling.\n\n\"Let's be very clear about something: Jemele Hill has always been a racist,\" Schilling said Wednesday on Sean Hannity's radio show, \"the things that she says, the things that she does. I don't have a problem with the fact that Jemele Hill is racist, that Bomani Jones is racist, and Colin Kaepernick knelt for a lie, and that Disney and ESPN, who they own, supports liberal racism.\"\n\nSmith, Hill's co-host, sees a different double standard \u2014 that he feels there's a higher bar for a show like theirs that is unafraid to be black, as compared with other white colleagues who have also tried to break the mold in different ways.\n\n\"When Bill Simmons does it, he's celebrated for it,\" Smith told The Ringer. \"When [Scott] Van Pelt does it, he's awesome; he's everyman; we relate to him. When Barstool does it, they're anti-establishment; they're new; they're fresh; they're the anti-ESPN. When we do it? 'Get this black s*** out of here!' That's what it feels like.\"\n\n\"Stick to sports\"\n\nA common refrain from sports fans is that they'd wish the sports people would stick to sports. Hill rejects that idea.\n\n\"When you're under the leadership of a president that refuses to condemn Nazis and racism, how am I supposed to function the rest of the day and pretend as if I give a s*** about Blake Bortles losing his job?\" Hill said during a Sports Illustrated media panel. \"That's the conversation I'm having with myself on a daily basis. I know there are sports fans looking for me to provide them with an 'escape,' but as a woman and person of color, I have no escape from the fact that there are people in charge who seem to be either sickened by my existence or are intent on erasing my dignity in every possible way. So today, my [Twitter] feed is probably a little edgier than it was. It's reflective of all the emotion and conflict I feel. I think others feel the same way.\"\n\nShe also points to coaches, like the San Antonio Spurs' Gregg Popovich, who is white and has been open about his antipathy for Trump, as well as black athletes, who have used their prominence to protest \u2014 from LeBron James and Colin Kaepernick to Muhammad Ali.\n\n\"This idea that sports has always been devoid of politics is a lie,\" Hill says in a video on The Root. \"The same person that will tell me to 'stick to sports' will also say Muhammad Ali was a great sports figure. What's the difference? The difference is now you know Muhammad Ali is right.\"\n\nSupport for Hill in the Trump era\n\nThere's been significant backlash, but believing she's \"right\" is one reason Hill has gotten so much support on social media. Here are just a few tweets, for example, compiled by black-interest magazine Vibe:\n\nThe controversy has spurred supportive columns, tooom:\n\nThe Guardian: \"Is it wrong to call Trump a white supremacist?\"\n\nCosmopolitan: \"Jemele Hill Called Donald Trump a White Supremacist. Where's the Lie?\"\n\nThe Chicago Tribune: \"As Trump seethes over ESPN anchor's tweet, a movement breathes to life.\"\n\nErik Wemple at The Washington Post ran down a list of \"just a few of the examples of our president's refusal to apologize when confronted with his racism and bigotry.\"\n\nAnd Trump himself stepped back into controversy on race this week by doubling down on his Charlottesville comments.\n\n\"I think especially in light of the advent of antifa, if you look at what's going on there, you know, you have some pretty bad dudes on the other side also,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One of an anti-fascist movement that has at times resorted to violent tactics against white supremacists. \"And essentially that's what I said.\"\n\nTrump added this defense: \"Now because of what's happened since then, with antifa, you look at, you know, really what's happened since Charlottesville \u2014 a lot of people are saying \u2014 in fact, a lot of people have actually written, 'Gee, Trump might have a point.' I said, 'You got some very bad people on the other side also,' which is true.\"\n\nWhile Trump has condemned white supremacists and the KKK, he has also been criticized for attempting to create a moral equivalency between white-power groups and protest groups on the left.\n\nRemarkably, Trump's latest comments came in response to a question about his meeting with Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the U.S. Senate. Scott had been hotly critical of Trump's Charlottesville response and had requested a meeting hoping a one-on-one appeal could bridge a divide with Trump.\n\nThat's where the U.S. is right now \u2013 a country split when it comes to perceptions of race and usually along racial and, increasingly, political lines. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found a majority didn't think Trump's response to Charlottesville was strong enough, but there was a sharp political divide \u2014 almost three-quarters of Democrats thought Trump's response was not strong enough, while a strong majority of Republicans thought it was strong enough.\n\nLoading...\n\nThat partisan divide was equally pronounced when it came to views of race relations more broadly. Again, nearly three-quarters of Democrats thought race relations had worsened in the past year while just a third of Republicans thought so.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe \"post-racial America\" some touted when Obama was elected was always a myth. To become the first black president \u2014 and to be re-elected \u2014 Obama had to walk a delicate line on race. Some black thinkers and writers weren't always happy with him because of that, and conservatives were rankled by his responses to the spate of police shootings of black men in his latter years.\n\nIn a country changing demographically, race relations moved to the front burner during the Obama era \u2014 and the pot boiled over with Trump's election.\n\nJemele Hill is just the latest example.

Trump's Question Answered\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. David Ake/AP J. David Ake/AP\n\n\"So this week it's Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson's coming down. I wonder, is it George Washington next week? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop? ... [Jefferson] was a major slave owner. Are we going to take down his statue?\" \u2014 President Trump, Aug. 15, 2017\n\nThe president made this statement Tuesday while jabbing at reporters over a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., where white nationalists protested the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nAnd he used one of his standard rhetorical techniques, \"whataboutism.\"\n\nWhile defending the protesters and claiming that they weren't all white supremacists, he changed the subject to attack others. \"What about the alt-left?\" he said, when asked about the white nationalist alt-right. (\"Alt-left\" is a term seemingly invented for whataboutism, making liberals seem like the moral equivalents of the \"alt-right,\" whose members coined that term themselves.)\n\nThe president's whataboutism on history is the focus here.\n\n\"Are we going to take down statues of George Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson?\" Trump asked, given Washington's and Jefferson's slave ownership. He added, \"You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?\"\n\nWell, let's take on those questions. The president is not the first person to ask.\n\nWashington did own slaves \u2014 and does not get a pass for freeing them at the end of his life. Jefferson was a \"major slave owner,\" too \u2014 and is even more to be criticized, because he understood that slavery was wrong, calling it a \"moral depravity\" and a \"hideous blot.\"\n\nNor were they alone among our Founding Fathers: James Madison was a slave owner; even Benjamin Franklin owned two slaves before the practice was banned in Pennsylvania. Slavery was so deeply entrenched in the economy that it touched nearly everyone who lived before the Civil War, even those who did not own a slave.\n\nThis is an awkward reality for the keepers of memorials and historic sites. Keepers of the Hermitage, Andrew Jackson's home, have been forced to wrestle with the reality that he took Indian land, used enslaved laborers on multiple plantations and even personally chased escaped slaves. The Hermitage has responded by expanding displays showing the dark side of this historic figure, but it is not planning to tear down the house.\n\nSo \"whatabout\" them? Must they all go if Robert E. Lee goes?\n\nNot necessarily, because they are not all the same.\n\nSome figures stood for something larger. Washington guided the foundation of a country that eventually preserved freedom for all. Jefferson authored the Declaration of Independence, in which a single phrase \u2014 \"that all men are created equal\" \u2014 became a hammer that later generations would use to help smash the chains of slavery.\n\nIt's possible to make a case for honoring such men, so long as we are also honest about their flaws. They were participants in a great experiment in self-government, which has expanded over time to embrace more and more people of all races, not to mention women, too.\n\nSo \"whatabout\" Lee? What did he stand for?\n\nLee, who is connected by marriage to the family of Washington, resigned from the Army to fight against his country, on the Confederate side in the Civil War.\n\nThen and later, Confederate apologists dismissed the idea that they were fighting to defend slavery. They said they were fighting for \"states' rights\" or against Northern oppression. But conflict over slavery was what drove the fight for states' rights and divided the country for years before the war. The election of Abraham Lincoln, a president who was critical of slavery, triggered the rebellion.\n\nAnd the Confederate vice president, Alexander H. Stephens, was more frank than others in stating the rebels' aims. In an 1861 speech, he declared that the \"cornerstone\" of the Confederacy was \"that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition.\"\n\nOther Confederates may have fought for different reasons; it is said that Lee went over to the rebel side because he could not bear to fight against his native Virginia. But Stephens' \"cornerstone\" speech accurately describes the larger cause that Lee willingly served and generally accepted: a drive to overturn the idea of equality, which Stephens called an \"error.\" This cause was the reason that many Confederate statues were built in the era of Jim Crow segregation, from after Reconstruction to the civil rights movement starting in the 1950s. Aside from Southern \"heritage\" or \"pride,\" many explicitly represented white supremacy.\n\nThere is still a case to be made for Lee as a brilliant general, who won battle after battle and kept his army together for years, even though it was massively outnumbered and undersupplied. He is a significant figure in the American story.\n\nUlysses S. Grant, the general who defeated him, gave the best epitaph of Lee, saying the Confederate general \"had fought so long and valiantly, and had suffered so much for a cause, though that cause was, I believe, one of the worst for which a people ever fought.\"\n\nBut let's be honest. In Charlottesville over the weekend, the \"Unite the Right\" protesters chanted \"blood and soil\"; others listened to Richard Spencer, who has called for an all-white homeland. Members of one group, Identity Evropa, \"seem to revel in goading counter-protesters into violent clashes,\" according to a profile of a member on KQED. Counterprotesters were indeed goaded into clashes \u2014 and a car, allegedly driven by an Ohio man on the white-nationalist side, drove into them, killing a woman.\n\nIs it remotely possible that Spencer and Identity Evropa and the driver of a Dodge Challenger came to defend the statue of Lee because of his skill in military tactics and strategy?\n\nTo have such defenders says a lot about the cause that Lee represented. To have the president of the United States compare Lee to Washington is simply, factually wrong.", "keywords": ["whatabout", "check", "fact", "jefferson", "question", "slave", "figures", "lee", "white", "trumps", "answered", "president", "confederate", "slavery", "washington", "historical", "cause"], "polarity": 0.06441643323996266, "subjectivity": 0.4289729225023342},

Their D.C. shop, Metro Liquors, was closed for business on Aug. 28, 1963, just one of 1,900 businesses ordered by local authorities not to sell, pour or wrap any alcoholic beverage from 12:01 that morning until 2 a.m. the next day.\n\nMaury Landsman, whose parents ran Metro Liquors, doesn't think his parents actually minded the order that much. For one, his father rarely got vacations, Landsman says. Manny Landsman worked six days a week at the store in the Adams Morgan neighborhood, which was a largely poor and black community back then \u2014 not the trendy spot it is today.\n\nThe second reason, Landsman says, stemmed from his white father's typical, even stereotypical, views \u2014 views he held despite having some African-American employees. \"I recall my father used to say black men always had mustaches and drank a lot.\"\n\nMaury, 20 at the time, didn't share those views. While the liquor store order left Maury 's parents free to stay home, Maury had different ideas about how he would spend the day.\n\nResisting His Parents' \"White-Privileged Attitudes\"\n\nThe decision by the Board of D.C. Commissioners, and similar ones in the nearby Maryland suburbs, temporarily depressed the local economy on an otherwise festive day. For the most part, consumers and local residents not participating in the march stayed home rather than going to work or running errands. Newspapers often describe the atmosphere as a quiet Sunday.\n\nD.C. Commissioner Walter N. Tobriner's written statement, quoted in The Baltimore Afro-American newspaper, said the order wasn't a reflection on the nonviolent demonstrators, \"who will be under strict discipline.\" His concern was that nonparticipants \"might well tend to disturb the peace and quiet of the city\" under the influence of alcohol.\n\nSo while his parents stayed home and watched the march on TV, Landsman headed down to the Mall. He had come home to the Washington suburbs two months earlier, after two years at the University of Chicago. He knew about the march from his student activism in the Windy City, he says, and made up his mind early that he was going. He even invited some of his Chicago buddies to camp out at his parents' apartment for the demonstration.\n\nLandsman also joined some of the new and growing left-leaning groups of the time \u2014 the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, Students for a Democratic Society and the Northern Student Movement. While his civil rights activism began while he was a college student, he says his views may have taken shape even before then.\n\n\"I was raised, in fact, in segregated schools until I was in about the sixth grade,\" he says. \"I went from kindergarten through high school in D.C. public schools.\" It wasn't until the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954 that the city's schools were integrated. He says his parents had no black friends when they lived in D.C., and he only visited other black students in their homes, never the other way around.\n\n\n\n\"My parents were strange, politically,\" he says. \"I'd describe them as working-class Democrats. They weren't actually racists, but they shared racial attitudes \u2014 what's now called white-privileged attitudes \u2014 of the majority of white people in the United States.\"\n\nLandsman had debates over race with his father's lawyer, a man he occasionally called \"Uncle\" and who was the son of Jewish immigrants, like his father. \"I would get into arguments about how Jews, given the history of the Holocaust, could be bigoted. I remember ... walking out of his house a couple of times,\" he says.\n\nThere were prevailing tensions at home between Landsman, his parents and their upwardly mobile friends and relatives. It was no better after he told them of his plans to attend the march. Safety, not politics, was their issue, he says. \"[It's] not that they were opposed. They were worried about my getting hurt. But I went anyway and they didn't try to stop me.\"\n\n\"Strangers, Black And White, Holding Hands\"\n\nLandsman's memories of the March on Washington revolve around feelings of \"being lifted up,\" he says. \"I was on the left side of the Reflecting Pool near the Lincoln Memorial. I can capture in my mind some of the songs. Some of John Lewis' speech is still in my mind.\n\n\"I remember Marian Anderson, Peter, Paul and Mary, Bob Dylan. I remember Joan Baez. I always found her singing uplifting, and 'We Shall Overcome' \u2014 that was amazing.\"\n\nAs the crowd marched, \"there were strangers, black and white, holding hands\" and singing that song and other spirituals that marked the movement, he says, like \"Keep Your Eyes on the Prize\" and \"Ain't Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Around.\"\n\nLandsman can vaguely imagine his parents watching the day's events on their black-and-white TV but can't recall if they ever discussed it. And the next day, when liquor stores reopened, it was business as usual.\n\nIn the end, Landsman received praise for his activism from his parents' friends, which he says made his parents secretly proud.\n\nNow 70, Landsman is a retired University of Minnesota law professor. Looking back, he's proud of his activism, first around civil rights and later against the Vietnam War. His wife, Julie, has been similarly involved, writing and lecturing on education and race. He describes his son, Aaron, as a \"good progressive, doing his part.\"\n\nWhen asked to offer a six-word statement on race relations today, 50 years after the march, for The Race Card Project, Landsman put it this way: \"Progress, but we are falling back.\"", "keywords": ["activism", "parents", "race", "black", "student", "biases", "white", "despite", "63", "landsman", "joining", "washington", "views", "racial", "dc"], "polarity": 0.036909867909867916, "subjectivity": 0.34256565656565663},

Welcome to the studio.\n\nGENE DEMBY, BYLINE: Hey, Audie.\n\nCORNISH: So what exactly are people taking issue with?\n\nDEMBY: We should start with this clip of the police chief in Austin talking about a 25-minute confession that was found on the bombing suspect's cellphone.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nCHIEF BRIAN MANLEY: It is the outcry of a very challenged young man talking about challenges in his personal life that led him to this point.\n\nDEMBY: And so a lot of people feel like if that suspect weren't white, that he would not have been extended that same sympathy.\n\nCORNISH: But is there any actual evidence - right? - to support the idea that different language is being used when it comes to, let's say, non-white perpetrators of mass violence?\n\nDEMBY: So first we should just make sure that we're not conflating statements from the police and the way that news outlets report these stories. But part of the coverage has to be devoted to what the police chief said. And there's a lot of research that shows that race does shape the way that cases of violence like this are covered in the news and that the characterization of this suspect by this police chief fits into this larger idea that white perpetrators of these kinds of attacks are portrayed if not sympathetically then at least not as terrorists. They're portrayed as challenged or troubled.\n\nThere was a headline this week in the news that read, quote, \"Maryland School Shooter Apparently Was A Lovesick Teen,\" unquote. And it was referring to a white high school student who shot two other students at a high school in Maryland. And that characterization came from the police, but that was the headline that was propagated on social media and elsewhere.\n\nCORNISH: So you saying people have actually looked at this question of whether, like, if the same shooter had been Muslim or of Middle Eastern descent, that the headline would have somehow been different.\n\nDEMBY: Right. And I spoke to someone named Erin Kearns at the University of Alabama. She studies terrorism and how it's covered in the news. She pointed to research that shows that - how the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando was covered versus how the shooting at Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston was covered. The shooter at the Pulse nightclub was of Arab descent, and Dylann Roof, the shooter at the Charleston church, was white.\n\nERIN KEARNS: And just comparing those two cases, they found that Omar Mateen was called a terrorist. It was described as terrorism, whereas Dylann Roof was called mentally ill. There was some discussion of whether or not to label it terrorism, but the media overall didn't label it as terrorism even though it very clearly meets an academic definition of what terrorism is.\n\nDEMBY: Now, that academic definition of terrorism is ideologically motivated violence that is meant to intimidate. In Kearns' own work, she and her colleagues found that when the strict definition of terrorism does apply to an attack, there's about four and a half times more coverage of one of those incidents in print media if the perpetrator was Muslim than if they were white.\n\nCORNISH: One argument I've seen is that somehow we should just expand the definition of terrorist - right? - so that it would include someone like Dylann Roof or the Austin, Texas, bomber.\n\nDEMBY: So this is what a lot of people want. They're frustrated by the idea that if we use terrorism to only describe politically or ideologically motivated violence, that it wouldn't include a case like this. There's a moral weight to calling something terrorism. And when white perpetrators are excluded from that categorization, it feels like we're letting them off the hook or treating it in some way as an aberration.\n\nBut Kearns would say that instead of expanding the definition of terrorism, we might all be better served by being more cautious in how we use it and more consistent in how we use it regardless of who the perpetrator is.\n\nCORNISH: NPR Code Switch reporter Gene Demby, thanks for looking into it for us.\n\nDEMBY: Thank you for having me, Audie.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ADAM FREELAND'S \"FABRICLIVE 16: ADAM FREELAND\")\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

{"title": "White Skin, Black Emojis?", "url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2018/03/21/425573955/white-skin-black-emojis", "text": "White Skin, Black Emojis?\n\nEnlarge this image captainsecret/Getty Images captainsecret/Getty Images\n\nTrying to pick the right emoji to convey exactly what you're feeling \u2014 excitement, fear, existential dread \u2014 can be tough. What makes it more complicated? All those different skin tones.\n\nOn Ask Code Switch, we take on your trickiest questions about race and identity. This week, we're tackling a letter from Kristyn Gelfand, 38, in Toronto. She writes:\n\nMy daughter, a very conscious 15-year-old queer, white girl, has recently started using black hand emojis. We discuss race and politics all the time at home. She even listens to your podcast with me sometimes. We live in a diverse neighborhood of a diverse city. As a family and on her own, our daily lives include many friendships and interactions with POC. So my question is, do I speak to her about using the emojis??\n\nHey there! (wave emoji)\n\nIf your daughter is like me, she believes an emoji is worth a thousand words. When a friend invites me over for dinner, I like to respond with a (thumbs-up). How else do you efficiently convey: \"Yes! What a great idea! I'm excited! (But not too excited)\"?\n\nThe problem is, the emoji you choose might be sending the wrong message. A text that reads as playful to one person might come off as insensitive to another. (We'll get into some of the reasons in a sec.)\n\nThere are a lot of reasons your daughter might be using black hand emojis. It sounds like she cares about the well-being of the people of color around her, and she is probably not trying to cause offense. So maybe she feels that black hand emojis better convey what she is trying to communicate. Or maybe she thinks using them is a good way to show solidarity with her friends of color.\n\nBut there is a problem here. When we step into the digital world, it's easy to feel like we can leave our IRL identities behind. But the power dynamics that exist in real life don't disappear just because we're hidden behind a screen.\n\nSo yes, you should absolutely speak to your daughter about the implications of using emojis that don't match her racial identity. And the first step is to ask some questions.\n\nQuestions like: Is her use of the emojis intentional, or something she just happened to do one day? Or, says Samantha Kemp-Jackson: \"What are you trying to say that you can't say in the color of your own skin?\"\n\nKemp-Jackson, a parenting expert and writer, says kids are more open to learning when they have a voice in the discussion. She says asking your daughter about her texting habits will allow her to think more deeply about what she is doing.\n\nIf your daughter believes that black skin is an inherent part of her message, she adds, then she needs to think harder about what it is about black skin that enhances her message. Does she think her raised-fist emoji looks more revolutionary when she paints it black? Her clapping hands more rhythmic? Her praise hands more dramatic? Her painted nails sexier?\n\nIf that turns out to be the case, then you should explain to her that she is playing up harmful stereotypes about black people, even if that is not her intent.\n\nYou and your daughter already talk about race a lot, so treat this as part of that ongoing discussion. You can explain to her that, as a white person, she has a lot of privilege, both on her phone and face to face.\n\nBy trying on black skin when it is fun, safe and convenient, your daughter is inadvertently trivializing the experiences of real black people.\n\n\"A white teenager can walk into a store, and they don't feel at that point that they want to be black,\" says Kemp-Jackson. Unlike your daughter, black people can't choose when to invoke their blackness.\n\nIf she's not convinced yet? It might help to crack open the annals of emoji history.\n\nBefore we could wave, clap and flip someone off in six different skin tones, emojis were just yellow. Simpsons yellow. This default, universal cartoon \"skin\" was based off of Caucasian skin tones. (And FYI, even on The Simpsons, black and brown characters were drawn black and brown.)\n\nFor a lot of people of color, those yellow emojis weren't ... us. Our praise hands always felt a little jaundiced.\n\nIt wasn't until 2015 that we got another five skin tones to choose from. Now, I can virtually high-five my friends with a brown hand that looks more like mine.\n\nBut white people never wound up taking to the lighter-skinned emojis. Andrew McGill at The Atlantic found that white emoji users err on the side of the yellow \"default,\" rather than the colors that more closely match their skin.\n\nWhy might that be? Before, when white people sent a high-five over text, it didn't have to be about race. For people of color, it was. Whenever we sent that yellow high-five, we were reminded that brown and black hands were not an option.\n\nMcGill writes that now that there are options, when white people send a high-five with white skin, it feels like sending a white high-five. For people who are used to thinking of their skin as the default, acknowledging whiteness in their digital hand gestures can feel deeply uncomfortable.\n\nAfter all, what does it mean to send a white high-five? Or a white hang-loose sign? Or even a white raised fist?\n\nUsing certain white emojis might feel a little weird to your daughter. She probably doesn't want to assert her whiteness in every text conversation.\n\nBut her discomfort is a product of her privilege, and that isn't a good enough reason to try on someone else's skin. So if she finds herself reaching for those black hands ... she should think twice.\n\nIf she needs them to help her with her message, she is probably not the right person to be saying it in the first place.\n\nDo you have thoughts on race-conscious emojis?

(More on this later.)\n\nOn Saturday, downtown Washington, D.C. was home to three prominent demonstrations that some feared might combine violently but instead stayed largely separate and peaceful, with modest attendance.\n\nThe self-described Mother of All Rallies, designed to support President Trump and \"defend American culture,\" was staged on the National Mall late Saturday morning.\n\nAround the same time and several blocks away, near the White House, was the Protect American Democracy rally, which organizers say was meant to tell the president to take a tougher stance against Russian interference in American elections.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Logan Werlinger for NPR Logan Werlinger for NPR\n\nThe rally garnering the most attention was the Juggalo March, an assembly set near the Lincoln Memorial of so-called Juggalos. The fans of the horror-core rap duo Insane Clown Posse are often adorned in face paint, tattoos and other symbols similar to those of the group. The march was described on its website as \"a collective statement from the Juggalo Family to the world about what we are and what we are not.\"\n\nInsane Clown Posse was founded in 1989, and despite criticism of the group's crude and sometimes violent lyrics, it developed a considerable and dedicated following of Juggalos. (The term derives from a 1992 Insane Clown Posse song, NPR's Tanya Ballard Brown reported.)\n\nIn a 2011 report, the FBI classified Juggalos as a \"loosely organized hybrid gang\" following violent incidents allegedly committed by fans of group. Juggalos, in tandem with the American Civil Liberties Union, sued the government in 2014, claiming Juggalos' \"constitutional rights to expression and association were violated\" by the FBI's classification. The case was dismissed but then later reinstated in September 2015.\n\nAnd, according to the event website for the Juggalo March, the case has been thrown out for a second time, \"meaning we are back to square one from a legal standpoint,\" the group says.\n\nThe case was dismissed both times by the same Michigan judge who said the Juggalos lacked \"legal standing,\" The Guardian reports. The fan base will now have to wait at least six months for a ruling on the ACLU's second appeal, the newspaper adds.\n\nThe Juggalos say the gang label has, through unfair discrimination, made it difficult to live a normal life for many of their members, some of whom were scheduled to speak on Saturday as part of the effort to express their anger with the FBI.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tyrone Turner/WAMU Tyrone Turner/WAMU\n\n\"We are taking out [sic] fight to the streets.

The rally's organizers wrote on their website that Confederate flags and racism would not be allowed, clearly hoping to distinguish their event from the march of white supremacists that turned deadly last month in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nNevertheless, as NPR's Windsor Johnston reported, some counterprotesters attempted to tie the MOAR rally to Charlottesville, including one who held a sign featuring an image of the woman killed by a motorist there.\n\nOfficials kept the protesters far from one another, which, along with a heavy police presence, appeared to keep the Saturday events peaceful, reported WAMU's Sasha-Ann Simons.", "keywords": ["political", "image", "juggalos", "posse", "plus", "caption", "logan", "juggalo", "clown", "rallies", "werlinger", "typical", "washington", "dc", "american"], "polarity": -0.04099714839151458, "subjectivity": 0.409023370995202},

Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his iconic \"I Have a Dream Speech\" Aug. 28, 1963. Approximately 250,000 people descended on the nation's capital from all over the country for the mass demonstration.\n\nThrough The Race Card Project's six-word stories, we'll meet some of the people who witnessed that history and hear their memories and reflections on race relations in America today.\n\nThis is the second in a two-part report about Clarence B. Jones and the March on Washington.\n\nAug. 28, 1963, was a tense day for Clarence B. Jones. As the longtime attorney and adviser for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Jones had a long list of worries as people started to fill the streets around the monuments on the National Mall. Were the right permits filed? Would the speakers veer off script? Would enough people show up?\n\n\"I had this feeling that we were going to throw a big party and nobody comes,\" Jones recalls.\n\nBut people did come \u2014 at least 250,000 of them. Still, Jones also worried that the crowd might also include agitators, \"some of what I called 'agent provocateurs' \u2014 white as well as black,\" Jones says. \"I didn't know whether some of the black nationalists who were opposed to Dr. King's non-violence, or whether some of the people from the right wing, the Klan ... would provoke something.\"\n\nAnd then there was the delicate and thorny issue of wrangling all those celebrities, Jones says, like Marlon Brando, Shelley Winters, Sidney Poitier, Joanne Woodward, Paul Newman, Joan Baez, Odetta and Bob Dylan, to name just a few.\n\nIn the end, things went smoothly, from the singers and the speakers to the big crowds and blue skies. After sleepless nights and fretful days, Jones was able to take his place on the stage at the Lincoln Memorial and take it all in.\n\n'Tell 'Em About The Dream!'\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption NPR/Erica Yoon NPR/Erica Yoon\n\nAmong his most vivid memories is singer Mahalia Jackson at the microphone, Jones says. \"How could you not be moved by this woman's voice? You would have to be unfortunately afflicted with some type of muscular disease that would prevent your muscles reacting to what your ear brought to your body.\"\n\nOf all the entertainers that day, Mahalia Jackson was the singer who had a special hold on King. When King was feeling down, he would speak with Jackson on the phone.\n\n\"I guess you would put it now as 'telephone gospel therapy,' \" Jones says. \"And he would speak to Mahalia Jackson and he would say, 'Mahalia, please sing to me. I'm having a rough day today.'\n\n\"And she would sing one or more of his favorite songs, and ... he would close his eyes listening to her,\" Jones continues. \"In some cases, tears would come down his face and then he would say, 'Mahalia, you are giving me the Lord's voice this morning.' \"\n\nKing had enormous respect for Jackson, Jones says. And because of that, the reverend listened to her when she offered him unsolicited advice while King stood at the podium on the day of the march.\n\nWhile he was reading from the prepared text, Jones says, Jackson shouted at King. \"This is after she had performed, of course, she's sitting down, and she just shouted at him ... 'Tell 'em about the dream, Martin! Tell 'em about the dream!' \"\n\nJackson knew that King had delivered a rousing speech earlier that summer at Detroit's Cobo Hall, bringing the crowd to a feverish pitch when he preached about his dream for a better America. So despite King's prepared script that August day, Jackson encouraged him to bring that moment from Detroit to the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.\n\n\"Now, most people probably didn't have the slightest idea what Mahalia was yelling to Dr. King,\" Jones says. \"What he did upon hearing that, he took the text of the speech \u2014 the written text that he was reading \u2014 and he moved it to the left side of the lectern [and] grabbed the lectern with both his hands.\n\n\"And I see this and I turn to the person standing next to me ... and I said, 'These people don't know it, but they're about ready to go to church.' \"\n\nSix Words And The Letter From Birmingham Jail\n\nJones is proud of his contribution to that moment in history, but he still wishes more of King's dream will be realized in his lifetime. He says he's tremendously proud of progress that's been made. But, as Jones wrote in his book, Behind The Dream, as long as there's a need for a legal category for hate crimes, police officers \"pulling over African Americans because they're driving cars considered out of their financial reach,\" and people \"selling their houses because too many black families have moved in,\" the dream remains diluted, tarnished and unfulfilled, he says.\n\nWhen asked about his thoughts on race today, Jones harkened back to the letter King wrote from inside the jail in Birmingham, Ala., in 1963. King scribbled out that letter on scraps of paper and it was Jones who secreted those scraps out of the building during several visits. In the letter, published under the headline, \"Why We Can't Wait,\" King said complacency and hate were the enemies of progress.\n\nSo, when asked to offer his six words on race, Jones replies, \"Hate is why we cannot wait.\"", "keywords": ["race", "wait", "dream", "adviser", "king", "jackson", "kings", "text", "fulfilling", "jones", "day", "letter", "mahalia"], "polarity": 0.03074675324675325, "subjectivity": 0.42880952380952375},

They've reached out to embrace the would-be targets of domestic terrorism.\n\nJury Selection To Begin In Kansas Mosque Bomb Plot Jury Selection To Begin In Kansas Mosque Bomb Plot Listen \u00b7 3:46 3:46\n\nNational Somali Immigrants Have Abandoned Kansas Town After Bomb Plot Somali Immigrants Have Abandoned Kansas Town After Bomb Plot Listen \u00b7 3:57 3:57\n\n\"We all give each other a chance here,\" says LeVita Rohlman, who directs the Catholic Agency for Migration and Refugee Services in Garden City, Kansas. \"Even when things go wrong. I believe that this community stands united.\"\n\nThe plot took root near Dodge City, at the easternmost point of a the Kansas meatpacking triangle formed with Liberal and Dodge City. For generations all three Great Plains cities have drawn immigrants for the smelly, dangerous work of transforming cattle into steaks and hamburger. It's work that few U.S.-born Americans seem eager to take on.\n\nJust outside Dodge City, Patrick Stein lived in an old trailer home in Wright, Kansas, next to a rusting Quonset hut and a grain elevator. Neighbors say that Stein came from a respected family in town, but that he kept strange hours.\n\nWhen FBI agents raided his home October 14, 2016, they say they found a high-powered rifle on the couch, ammunition and what appeared to be methamphetamine pipes. They also found a piece of paper with the address of an apartment complex in Garden City that authorities say was target for an act of domestic terror.\n\nCultures mix in the meatpacking triangle\n\nIn Dodge City, Garden City and Liberal, people of European descent are now in the minority. Immigrants from Africa, Asia, and Latin America, are a key part of workforce.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Frank Morris/KCUR Frank Morris/KCUR\n\nOne of Stein's old neighbors in Wright, Chelsea Bradville, lives in a home decorated with taxidermy and patriotic figurines. A pickup sporting a large black assault rifle decal sits out front. Bradville, like many in the meatpacking triangle, harbors an abiding respect for immigrants doing the hard work at area slaughterhouses.\n\n\"It's very intensive labor, and there's a lot of the community that doesn't want to do that, you know, and they do,\" says Bradville. \"They'll do the hard work, and make it.\"\n\nThat thinking is pretty widespread. Old West towns like Dodge City lay claim to authentic gunslinger credibility and a history of destitute farmers toughing it out through the Dust Bowl years.\n\nThe modern story of the region speaks to a place where just about anyone, from anywhere, can make a living and gain a toehold on the American dream. Earl Watt publishes The High Plains Daily Leader and the Southwest Daily Times in Liberal.\n\n\"Opportunity may take you elsewhere, but this is a place where you get a chance to get started,\" promises Watt. \"If life bottoms you out, come on out, get restarted here. You'll get that chance. We'll get you back on your feet. That's what defines us more than anything else.\"\n\nBecause of the alleged plot, southwest Kansas might have instead been defined something more sinister, domestic terrorism. Instead, authorities contend, a deadly scheme was foiled through the work of someone Stein believed to be a natural compatriot in his anti-Muslim crusade.\n\n\"The only good Muslim, is a dead Muslim\"\n\nEarly in 2016, an acquaintance of Patrick Stein's contacted the FBI and became a paid confidential informant. That led him to record conversations with Stein and during meetings with two other men \u2014 Curtis Allen and Gavin Wright \u2014 who had allegedly joined his makeshift, anti-government, anti-Muslim militia.\n\ntoggle caption Frank Morris/KCUR\n\nThey called themselves the Crusaders. According to the indictment, Stein seemed to relish mass murder.\n\n\"The only good Muslim is a dead Muslim,\" Stein allegedly said in one recorded conversation. \"If you're a Muslim, I'm going to enjoy shooting you in the head.\"\n\nThat, according to court records, included 1-year-olds. Stein regularly referred to Somalis as \"cockroaches,\" prosecutors contend, and compared himself to an exterminator.\n\nThe recordings allegedly chronicle the Crusaders discussing bomb types, and ordering supplies to make explosives, some of which were shipped to Gavin Wright's modular home dealership in Liberal.\n\nCurtis Allen was allegedly put in charge of writing a manifesto to be released after the group launched its bombing campaign. That document would fame the terror attacks as patriotic defense of the U.S. Constitution and, they hoped, inspire other groups to wage war on Muslim immigrants. They allegedly decided to time the attack for just after the November 2016 election, so as not to hurt Donald Trump's chances.\n\nTheir lawyers had sought to make sure juror were drawn not from more urban Wichita, but from more reliably conservative voters in the state's southwestern corner. A judge rejected that request.\n\nAllen had been convicted of domestic battery, and wasn't supposed to have guns. But court documents say that when agents searched his home they found almost two dozen firearms and thousands of rounds of ammunition.\n\nWhy are you trying to kill me?\n\nThe men eventually settled on 312 West Mary Street in Garden City, a closely spaced cluster of eight one-story apartment buildings. More than 100 people, primarily east African immigrants, live there. One apartment serves as a mosque.\n\nAccording to court documents, the Crusaders discussed parking trucks loaded with explosives at the corners of the complex, placing bombs disguised as trash receptacles, and laying explosives in the duct work.\n\nThey spoke of shooting survivors, after leveling the buildings.\n\nIfrah Farah, a Somali immigrant who proudly states that she's been in the United States four years, lives in a sparsely decorated apartment at the edge of the complex.\n\n\"I would like to ask the bad guys, 'Why? What am I doing? Why are you trying to kill me? Am I Somali? Or, am I Muslim? What?'\" she said.\n\nThe plot unravels\n\nOn October 11, 2016, police in Liberal arrested Allen, not long after his girlfriend called 911 to report that he had beaten her.\n\nThe next day, Stein had a meeting with an undercover FBI agent. The agent had been introduced by the FBI's confidential source within the Crusaders group, as some kind of underworld figure, who could get him explosives. Stein had a long wish list: C-4 high explosives, machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades.\n\n\"If I could get ahold of a warthog or an Apache helicopter I would be after that, too,\" said Stein, according to court records.\n\nStein and the agent discussed trading cash and methamphetamine for explosives and machine guns.\n\nAt the meeting, the undercover FBI employee let Stein fire fully automatic weapons. Then the agent and Stein drove to 312 West Mary Street, to scope out the place.\n\nGarden City gets it right\n\nTwo days later, FBI agents arrested Stein when he delivered them 300 pounds of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, the same raw material Timothy McVeigh used to bomb the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995.\n\nIn the Oklahoma City bombing, McVeigh was inspired by \"The Turner Diaries,\" a novel that glorified the idea of a race war. McVeigh had hoped his act would inspire others to take up arms against the federal government.\n\nAfter Stein's arrest, the FBI called Garden City Police Chief Michael Utz. He, in turn, called local immigrants\n\n\"When the terrorist plot was uncovered, I reached out to the president of the African Community Center, and I said, 'I need your help,'\" Utz recalled. \"He said, 'What do you need, chief?'\"\n\nUtz wanted help convening a quick meeting with African immigrant leaders to tell them about the bomb plot before it hit the news. The next day, he was back to reassure other refugees.\n\n\"We made it a point to let the community know, that the three individuals involved in this conspiracy, were in custody, that the community was safe.\"\n\nMore meetings, along with public demonstrations, supporting the immigrants followed. By most accounts, they worked.\n\nSitting on his couch, in that Mary Street apartment complex, Abdulkadir Mohamed said Garden City has grown closer since government exposed the alleged the bomb plot.\n\n\"The FBI, CIA, and law enforcement work together. That's what I believe. That's why I'm really happy. And I appreciate what they do here. Because, I'm still alive,\" said Mohamed.\n\nMohamed is optimistic about the future of Garden City.\n\nBut 60 miles south of Garden City, in Liberal, the disclosure of the bomb plot had the opposite effect.\n\n\"Liberal is not innocent, anymore,\" said Ambiyo Farah, an 18-year-old college student in Liberal whose family fled civil war in Somalia over a decade ago. \"It's like Somalia now, you know, there's a threat on you.\"\n\nFarah says that she's one of the few from her native country still living in Liberal. Nearly 200 Somalis have fled the small city. That's clear at what used to be a thriving African grocery store.\n\n\"This is the place, or it used to be the place, but now it's a ghost town. There's no one here,\" Farah said while standing at a corner storefront in downtown Liberal, where a sign over the locked door reads International African Grocery.\n\n\"It used to be really beautiful,\" recalls Farah, looking at the building. \"Someone standing here, dressed their African clothing, just to welcome you, say hi. Give you something if you had a kid with you, but there's no one here now.\"\n\nDown the block, ripped up carpet and insulation litter what used to be a storefront mosque.\n\nFarah said many Somalis from Liberal moved to Garden City, joining a larger, and more secure Somali community there.\n\n\"A lot of people ... have a misperception about what my religion is,\" says Farah \"If you don't believe what they believe in, you're an automatic threat. You're here to take something, or you're here to hurt somebody.\"", "keywords": ["fbi", "garden", "meat", "rattles", "kansas", "bombing", "triangle", "liberal", "mosque", "work", "plot", "stein", "immigrants", "bomb", "city"], "polarity": 0.05641836558503225, "subjectivity": 0.37451373141849337},

Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his iconic \"I Have a Dream Speech\" Aug. 28, 1963. Approximately 250,000 people descended on the nation's capital from all over the country for the mass demonstration.\n\nThrough The Race Card Project's six-word stories, we'll meet some of the people who witnessed that history and hear their memories and reflections on race relations in America today.\n\nThis is the first in a two-part report about Clarence B. Jones and the March on Washington.\n\n\n\nAsk Clarence B. Jones to identify himself, and he'll tick off a list of titles. \"I live in Palo Alto, Calif., and I am a visiting professor at the University of San Francisco, and a scholar, writer-in-residence at Stanford University's Martin Luther King Jr. Institute.\"\n\nJones was also the first black man to make partner at a Wall Street investment bank, but he's leaving something else out, too. Jones, 81, was also the personal attorney and adviser to Martin Luther King Jr. during the height of the civil rights movement. Fifty years ago, on the eve of the March on Washington, Jones was working hard to make sure every detail went off without a hitch. Jones remembers it as \"a stressful day.\"\n\nFor all the reminiscing over the years about King and his dream for a better America, the organizers of the march were not just stargazing about change. They had a long and highly specific set of demands. That 10-point list included \"dignified jobs at decent wages,\" \"desegregation of all school districts,\" and a ban on discrimination in \"all housing supported by federal funds,\" among other things.\n\nThe Genesis Of 'The Promissory Note'\n\nJones knew that King would need strong words and strong imagery to make that case. So he suggested language based on a recent experience in Birmingham, Ala. When hundreds of children were arrested after the Children's March in Birmingham in May \u2014 where dogs and fire hoses were unleashed on youngsters \u2014 civil rights organizers needed cash to make bail.\n\n\"I got a call \u2014 an urgent call \u2014 from Harry Belafonte, because we were getting enormous pressure from the parents of these kids to get them out of jail,\" Jones recalls.\n\nThe Rockefeller family wanted to help, so Jones had to fly to New York, go to a bank vault and sign a promissory note in exchange for $100,000 in cash.\n\nThat means, Jones explains, that \"when the creditor calls you and say[s], 'Pay me,' you pay that person.\"\n\nSo when he was helping King draft talking points for his speech, Jones suggested that event would make a powerful analogy.\n\n\"You know, coming here to Washington ... is like we are coming to our nation's capitol and ask[ing] to be repaid, or ask[ing]to be paid in full, on a promissory note,\" Jones says. \"Well, there has to be sufficient funds in the vaults of justice in this country.\"\n\nIndeed, King used that image of a bounced check to assert that America had failed to live up to its promise. \"It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned,\" King intoned from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. \"Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check; a check which has come back marked 'insufficient funds.' \"\n\nJones has chronicled his work with King in his book, Behind the Dream, co-authored with Stuart Connelly. And while working on the memoir, Jones had some unlikely source material.\n\ntoggle caption Emily Bogle/FBI\n\nAn Unexpected Historical Archive\n\n\"Little did we know until years later, that every single conference call we had, every single telephone conversation related to the march and other matters, was wiretapped and the contents transcribed by the FBI. So while we would be having so-called confidential conference calls, there was another party that was also a part of everything we did,\" Jones says. \"The contents were wire recorded, transcribed and written into a daily running transcript.\"\n\nAttorney General Robert Kennedy signed off on the wiretaps, Jones says. And because of those wiretaps, Jones now knows how the FBI viewed King's performance at the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nSubsequently, Jones says, he was reviewing an internal top-secret FBI memo, when he learned that the FBI considered King dangerous.\n\nUnder a memo titled \"Negro Question,\" the FBI memo said this about King: \"He stands head and shoulders above all other Negro leaders put together when it comes to influencing great masses of Negroes. We must mark him now, if we have not done so before, as the most dangerous Negro of the future in this Nation.\"\n\nThat memo was dated Aug. 30, 1963 \u2014 two days after the March on Washington. All these years later, Jones is actually grateful for those wiretaps. Thanks to the FBI, he has a vast \u2014 and accurate \u2014 archive of the time.\n\n\"If I have a fuzzy memory or hazy memory, I look at it, and there's a verbatim transcript of the conversations about a certain event, a certain person or a certain problem we were discussing,\" Jones says.\n\nJones always thought the government was listening. King, he says, didn't want to believe him.\n\n\"In his harshest moments, he would \u2014 not accuse me, but he would characterize me as being a 'left-wing McCarthyite.' That I was seeing FBI agents under the bed and all around, just like Joseph McCarthy saw Communists,\" Jones recalls. \"It would come up because often we would have conference calls around 10:30, 11:00 at night, and that's after I had maybe two martinis and a shot of Jack Daniels. ...\n\n\"Anyway, I would get on the phone, and I would say, 'OK, is everybody ready now?' ... And I'd say, 'OK, Mr. FBI man or FBI woman, do you have your pencil ready? Do you have your pad ready now? Because we're gonna start this conference call.'\n\n\"And Dr. King would say, 'Clarence, why don't you stop that? ... They have much better things to do than to listen to our conversation.' \"\n\nOf course, Jones had the last laugh \u2014 and even now, 50 years later, he laughs as he recounts the conversation. \"I said, 'Oh really?'

Haffey/Getty Images Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images\n\nIn 2009, the former UCLA basketball star Ed O'Bannon took on the NCAA in a lawsuit that challenged the organization's ability to profit from the likenesses of college athletes in a video game. But as the case heated up, its stakes and scope began to sprawl, opening a can of worms that threatened to upend one of the bedrock principles of college sports: amateurism.\n\n\"I wanted ... to get the NCAA to at least admit that they were wrong in using former players likeness for profit, and that eventually branched off into current players owning their likeness and why they should,\" O'Bannon said to me on the Code Switch podcast. \"Then it branched off later into actual current players getting paid from the universities and from the NCAA \u2014 not only basketball and football, but all athletes. Men and women.\"\n\nThe NCAA will make $771 million from the NCAA men's basketball tournament this year. The coaches at the biggest basketball schools have average salaries of around $3 million. But most Americans are not on board with the idea that the men who play the games should be paid.\n\nThere is a racial split here: A majority of white people oppose paying college athletes while a majority of black people are in favor. As we learned on the podcast, racial resentment toward African-Americans is a very strong predictor of opposition to paying student-athletes. (And let's not forget the racial optics of the NBA's \"one-and-done rule,\" by which most of the very best pro basketball prospects must spend a year masquerading as undergraduates because the NBA bars them from entry until they're a year out of high school.)\n\nEkow Yankah, a law professor at Cardozo Law School in New York City (and a huge fan of University of Michigan sports), offered a somewhat counterintuitive take on all this in a New Yorker essay, \"Why N.C.A.A. Athletes Shouldn't Be Paid.\" Yankah believes the current system is unfair and rife with exploitation, but believes that paying college athletes would essentially just entrench that arrangement.\n\nBelow is an edited version of our conversation with him on the Code Switch podcast episode, \"The Madness of March.\"\n\nWalk us through what you think might happen if we paid college athletes.\n\nI think paying college athletes is almost certainly bad for the athletes, terrible for the universities and terrible for the sports they play. Other than that, it's a great idea. There's very little reason to think that a young athlete's life will be in any substantial way better if they become, so to speak, employees of the university.\n\nOf course, many of these young men are under tremendous financial difficulty. I understand that a good number of them come from backgrounds which are difficult or even impoverished, and I'm well-aware that the demands of big-time college sports, but almost all college sports, are so consuming that there seems something unfair about their having to balance these two projects.\n\nThe problem is that paying them doesn't help relieve that stress, paying them only makes it the case that that stress seems justified. Paying college athletes will almost certainly exacerbate a problem that has been going on for generations, where athletes of a certain number of sports are seen as ever more divided from the actual student body. They're seen as tangential. They're seen as not real students. And, indeed, given that they will then have to trade some of the minimal protections that they have as student-athletes in order to simply be employees of the university, at least in some capacity. It seems like a pretty raw deal. All of this, by the way, is in exchange for what it would actually be, for the vast majority of athletes, a remarkably small amount of money on the free market.\n\nYou're saying that the best players would get the most money, but most players would get a pittance, if it was not equalized.\n\nThe point is that it's awfully hard to project which kids will be superstars. So outside of the small number of \"can't-miss\" prospects, most kids will actually be paid on some scale that reflects the deep uncertainty about how good they'll be. And if we want to see what that looks like, we don't have to use our imagination. We can look at the minor leagues: minor league basketball, minor league baseball and minor league hockey. Most of these young people are working nonstop. Most of them are just as talented, if not more talented, than the vast majority of college athletes. Most of them are paid roughly what a Starbucks barista is paid. And in exchange for all that, they give up their opportunity to go to college, to pursue their dreams and to turn out to not be a 20 year-old superstar but maybe a 40 year-old functioning adult.\n\nYou say that there is a racial component to the way that people think about the minor league systems, and the prospect of paying student-athletes in men's basketball and football.\n\nOne thing I worry about is this argument that, \"Well, these students aren't really students, anyway. So let's just pay them.\" And I do think that has a racial component. It's not entirely racial, of course. Part of it is that people are well-aware and turned off by the huge financial incentive that the universities have.\n\nBut it's also true that there are a ton of different students on every college campus who are not straight-A math students. Somehow when we think about young black athletes and what they do, the sort of physical talent that they bring is not valued the same way that the ballerina's is or the chess player's is, or the musician's is \u2014 and I do find that worrying. I wonder why it is that these are multitalented people whose skills may not be at its highest in science class is so quickly dismissed.\n\nIt's very clear that the true developmental league of the NBA is currently college basketball. The true developmental league of the NFL is entirely college football. And, somehow, the answer seems to be, \"disconnect these students from education\" rather than, \"why don't we do what we do with other sports and set up a robust semi-pro league?\" One that would allow some students, those who are actually involved and engaged, to remain student-athletes and allow those for whom being a student-athlete has no part of their project to go on to do what they want to do.\n\nBut it seems like even with that system [where minor leagues for football and basketball exist alongside the traditional college system for those sports], there's still a lot of kids who have no illusions about the fact that that they're not going to go pro, who will go to college, who will try to make the most of their college experience and will still generate tons of revenue for those colleges while they personally struggle financially because they can't be paid. I'm just curious what happens to those kids.\n\nI think that's a great question, and it gets the heart of how complex and hard this is. If you're a student-athlete who comes to Michigan well-aware that you're never going to professional, then there's a real sense in my mind's eye that you will make the deal that makes being a student-athlete worth it. That is to say, that your education will actually be valuable to you in a way that matters. You'll be much less likely to be fooled or to trade on these fumes of dreams that allow school after school to give college athletes empty classes with no value that end up with empty degrees with no value.\n\nI am not interested in a bunch of young men who work for three or four years for a university making a minor league salary, which, if people actually looked at what that would be, is quite minimal. I'm interested in the next generation of doctors and lawyers and bankers. And in particular, for the sports that are dominated by African-American men, I'm deeply interested in the next generation of black doctors, black lawyers and black bankers, rather than kids who are seduced into trading that for making spending money from 18 to 22.", "keywords": ["minor", "think", "students", "paid", "athletes", "pay", "college", "studentathletes", "league", "paying", "basketball", "racial", "shouldnt"], "polarity": 0.07191494378017817, "subjectivity": 0.46825640505328014},

The Racial Income Gap Persists\n\nEnlarge this image amathers/Getty Images amathers/Getty Images\n\nA new study conducted by researchers at Stanford, Harvard and the Census Bureau, finds that in 99 percent of neighborhoods in the United States, black boys earn less in adulthood than white boys who come from similar socioeconomic backgrounds. This undermines the widely-held belief that class, not race, is the most fundamental predictor of economic outcomes for children in the U.S.\n\nThe study looked at racial disparities in income over generations by looking at de-identified data from 20 million U.S. children and their parents. It tracked outcomes for Hispanic, white, Asian, black and Native Americans.\n\nRace Research Shows Black Boys Are Most Likely To Be Stuck In Cycle Of Poverty Research Shows Black Boys Are Most Likely To Be Stuck In Cycle Of Poverty Listen \u00b7 2:43 2:43\n\nNathaniel Hendren, who co-authored the study, told NPR's Leah Donnella that black and Native American children have the lowest rates of upward economic mobility. Whites and Asians came out at the top, he said. \"For Asians and white children, we find very similar processes of mobility,\" Hendren said. \"For Hispanics, we see slightly lower incomes for children at the same level of parent income.\"\n\nThe researchers found that the racial wealth gap applies even to the country's wealthiest families: Black children whose parents were in the top 1 percent of earners, with incomes at an average of $1.1 million, grew up to have incomes 12.4 percent lower than white children who grew up in households with similar incomes.\n\nHendren says for the U.S. as a whole, the odds of a child raised in the bottom fifth of the income distribution rising to the top fifth are about 7 percent. But that chance at upward mobility varies widely across race. The study found that about 11 percent of white children raised in the bottom fifth end up rising to the top. For black children, that number is 2.5 percent.\n\nThe results are also gendered. The income gap between black and white Americans, the study finds, is almost entirely driven by differences in earnings between black and white men. When the researchers controlled for parental income, they found black women earn slightly more than white women. Meanwhile, white men are far out-earning black men, even when they start out in families with similar income levels.\n\nFor Native Americans, Hendren says, the gender difference is not as stark, but low rates of upward mobility and high rates of downward mobility persist.\n\nAdvocates of programs that address the specific needs of black boys could see the study as an affirmation of their efforts. Will Jawando, who worked on Barack Obama's My Brother's Keeper initiative, told The New York Times that this study \"crystallizes and puts data behind this thing that we always knew was there, because we either felt it ourselves or we've seen it over time.\"\n\nNeighborhoods are still a determining factor when it comes to adult earnings and life outcomes. That holds across race and ethnicity. But Hendren says the study finds a larger black-white wealth gap in the most affluent neighborhoods: \"It suggests that policies ... that aim to reduce just residential segregation can help, and I certainly don't want to say those policies are not fruitful. But we can't stop there if we want to try to eliminate racial disparities.\"\n\nHendren said the study did identify a few neighborhoods where black and white children often reach parity as adults. He highlighted some suburbs of Washington, D.C., including Silver Spring, Md., as having relatively low degrees of racial bias among white people \u2014 one significant predictor of whether or not black boys will match white boys in future earnings. Another factor present in the neighborhoods was high percentages of present black fathers, compared to the country as a whole. (The Times points out that this does not mean the presence of a black boy's father in his life has a direct effect on his eventual earnings; rather, the presence of black fathers in a community may help predict higher incomes for the black boys who grow up there.)\n\nAs for why the differences in wealth and mobility are most persistent among certain groups, Hendren suggests history might play a role. \"Here, I'm speculating. But ... the two groups who happen to stand out \u2013 African-Americans and Native Americans \u2013 tend to be groups who have experienced a very different history in America,\" he says. \"And so I think that does suggest thinking about the long-run historical processes that might have gotten us here.\"", "keywords": ["children", "black", "wealth", "gap", "white", "persists", "boys", "study", "forget", "income", "hendren", "neighborhood", "racial", "mobility"], "polarity": 0.06213351628530202, "subjectivity": 0.37830692125334986},

But two former D.C. police officers who worked the event that day remember that there was no guarantee that the day would go smoothly.\n\nBack in 1963, Joseph Burden, who is black, and Martin Niverth, who is white, were both rookie cops with the D.C. police department, living in a highly segregated city and working for a segregated police force.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Martin Niverth Courtesy of Martin Niverth\n\n\"If you walked a foot beat, you walked with another white officer,\" Niverth says. \"If you were assigned to a car, you were assigned to a car with another white officer.\"\n\n\"I do recall, at one time, they passed out 3x5 cards and ... instructed us to write down whether you would like to work with an integrated partner,\" Burden remembers. \"The 'noes' were overwhelming. So it was quite obvious that, as far as they [the white officers] were concerned, they didn't want to work with us. And I guess they really had very little use for Martin Luther King.\"\n\nAll Hands On Deck\n\nFor a segregated police force, a mass demonstration calling for racial equality presented challenges. The police department readied the officers by stressing the need to maintain order and the dignity of the force. After all, this was just months after Birmingham's commissioner for public safety, Eugene \"Bull\" Connor, had unleashed dogs and fire hoses on peaceful demonstrators in that city.\n\nThough 19,000 federal troops were stationed just outside the D.C. city limits, police officers in Washington were not instructed to wear riot gear. Officers wore \"no special equipment, just regular uniforms that we would use if we were walking the beat,\" Burden says.\n\n\"Before I went to work, I shined my shoes, cleaned by brass, checked my revolver, and made sure I had my badge and my wallet,\" Niverth recalls.\n\nEveryone worked that day \u2014 no vacation days were granted. The entire force gathered early at the police garage downtown for instructions. It was a hot, humid day in the nation's capital, even at 6 a.m., Niverth remembers. Both officers recall that the instructions were fairly simple: Be alert. Be safe. Keep calm.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Erica Yoon/NPR Erica Yoon/NPR\n\nBurden was assigned to the Lincoln Memorial and ended up on the steps right behind where Martin Luther King Jr. gave his speech. Niverth was instructed to patrol a several-block stretch along the National Mall, quite a distance from where the central activities were taking place.\n\n\"You just do what you do any other day, you know,\" he says. \"You just walked the beat, [made] sure things are orderly.\"\n\nTwo Officers, Different Opportunities\n\nBut Niverth's partner assignment that day was anything but routine.\n\n\"I don't know why they did this; they assigned me with another rookie \u2014 and he was a black officer,\" Niverth says. \"His name was William Wallace.\"\n\n\"I wasn't out there too long before I did realize that this was a pretty significant event,\" Niverth says. By 9 a.m., \"people started to show up, and they started to show up in great numbers. ... You could see they had a purpose. But they weren't angry. I didn't feel threatened as a police officer on the street.\"\n\nIn fact, one black family in attendance shared their lunch with Niverth and Wallace. \"Me and Wallace walked over and they asked us if we wanted something. And they gave us a small plate.\"\n\nNiverth and Wallace may have had shared personal ambitions for growth in their department, but the signs and speakers at the March reminded Niverth that the playing field was not level back in 1963.\n\n\"We weren't walking the beat in our area too long and [Wallace] says, 'Marty, ... I hope you think this is an important day, that it's important to us.'\n\n\"And I said, 'Yes, I do.' \"\n\nAnd as speaker after speaker called for equality and justice, Burden felt somewhat torn as a rookie cop. \"Being a police officer, not too long out of the police academy, you're thinking more of the law than you are thinking in terms of how you fit into the big picture,\" Burden says. \"So I was thinking in terms of, you know, if you're shutting down traffic and what not, that's a violation.\"\n\nYet the marchers were fighting for rights that Burden didn't have. \"When I saw those signs and placards and whatnot that the people were holding, then I realized, you know, they were speaking about me as well.\n\n\"You know, I had a job, but I needed the freedom as well. I was thinking back on the times when I couldn't go into the five-and-dime store to drink a Coke at the counter, and I couldn't go to the theaters downtown and things of this nature,\" Burden continues. \"When I think back, yes, I wish I could have marched.\"\n\nA Changed Force, A Changed Nation\n\nBurden and Niverth both say that, in all their years of police work, the March for Jobs and Freedom was the most peaceful and most festive mass demonstration they had ever seen. The event helped usher in a new era in the D.C. Police Department \u2014 more promotions, more integrated partnerships and more recruiting of women and people of color.\n\nTwo years later, Joe Burden became one of the first black officers assigned to an integrated patrol car in Washington.

Both officers are now retired from the D.C. police department, but still live in the Washington area.\n\nWhen asked to share his six words about race relations in America today, Niverth offers, \"Progress, but long way to go.\" He chose those words, he says, \"because I was under the false impression that civil rights causes were resolved. Until some of the recent things have been occurring, and state legislators about voting rights, etc.\"\n\nBurden's six words reflect the many years of his police career spent working with young people: \"The youngsters are making the changes.\"\n\n\"The changes are coming about with the youngsters,\" he explains. \"They're the ones that you see are interacting with one another, you see them marrying one another, you see them doing away with all discriminatory practices, you see them opening themselves up to \u2014 everything.\"", "keywords": ["martin", "officer", "walking", "black", "white", "wallace", "63", "beat", "officers", "day", "washington", "know", "niverth", "burden"], "polarity": 0.09677500890163229, "subjectivity": 0.4257529411425515},

That's according to a new study from the Equality of Opportunity Project, which looked at U.S. Census data to study the lives of 20 million children.\n\nAILSA CHANG, HOST:\n\nA new analysis of census data on 20 million children and their parents offers this sobering fact - black boys are the least likely of any group to climb out of poverty and most likely to fall into it. That's true if they're born poor or wealthy. Leah Donnella from NPR's Code Switch team reports.\n\nLEAH DONNELLA, BYLINE: Nathaniel Hendren has two big takeaways when it comes to the economic outcomes of black boys versus white boys.\n\nNATHANIEL HENDREN: First, we see very sharp disparities in upward mobility. Then second, we see very big disparities also in downward mobility.\n\nDONNELLA: Hendren is an economics professor at Harvard. He coauthored the race and economic opportunity study with Raj Chetty of the Equality of Opportunity Project. The study found that white kids who grew up wealthy are five times more likely to stay wealthy than to become poor, but black boys born in the top income bracket have a 50-50 chance of falling into the bottom fifth of income earners.\n\nHENDREN: Even children whose parents make the same amount of money, who grow up on the same block, they grow up to have dramatically different incomes in nearly every single neighborhood in the U.S.\n\nDONNELLA: The same was not true for black girls. Hendren says the black-white mobility gap comes entirely down to differences in outcomes for men, not women. When you control for parental income, black women actually end up making more money than white women and attend college at higher rates than white men. And Hendren says part of that difference might have to do with incarceration rates, which are highest for black men.\n\nHENDREN: Even for black sons whose families make roughly a million dollars a year, they are equally likely to be incarcerated as a - the white son of a family that makes $40,000 a year.\n\nDONNELLA: The study also looked at economic outcomes for other groups in the U.S. From generation to generation, Latinos are getting closer to earning the same amount as white people. Asian-Americans have about the same mobility levels as whites. Native Americans have the second-lowest rates of upward mobility after African-Americans. And for black boys, there are two things that seem to make a big difference. One, it's better to grow up in neighborhoods where a lot of black men live, and two, outcomes are worse in neighborhoods with a lot of racial bias.\n\nHENDREN: So in places where whites are more naturally associating white faces with, quote, unquote, \"good outcomes\" and black faces with, quote, unquote, \"bad outcomes,\" you do see that the gaps between white and black children who grow up in those neighborhoods are larger.\n\nDONNELLA: A few suggestions the study puts out - more mentoring programs for black boys, reducing discrimination in criminal justice, and trying to reduce racial bias in white people.

Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his iconic \"I Have a Dream Speech\" on Aug. 28, 1963. Approximately 250,000 people descended on the nation's capital from all over the country for the mass demonstration.\n\nThrough The Race Card Project's six-word stories, we'll meet some of the people who witnessed that history and hear their memories and reflections on race relations in America today.\n\nMany images from the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom have taken on iconic status. One of them is a photo of a young black girl attending the march. You may have seen this picture, because it has been used in documentaries, textbooks and museum exhibits. She has short hair with bangs and is holding a black and white banner. The girl is not smiling; in fact, it's hard to put a finger on her emotions \u2014 anger? Impatience? Sorrow?\n\nRowland Scherman is the freelance photographer who snapped that picture while on assignment for the U.S. Information Agency. He was taking photos and saw a girl in the front row of a crowd near where Martin Luther King Jr. made his \"I Have a Dream\" speech.\n\n\"And I see some people laughing, and some people crying and some people earnest. And ... not only was she beautiful, but she was so involved,\" Scherman says.\n\nThe girl in that picture is Edith Lee-Payne. She's from Detroit, and the day of the March was her 12th birthday. For decades, she had no idea that she'd become a poster child for the civil rights movement. But in October 2008, her cousin spotted the picture on the back of a black history calendar.\n\n\"And she phoned to tell me, and I didn't believe her,\" Lee-Payne says. \"Because also on the front cover, as well as the back, were pictures of Frederick Douglass, Dr. Martin Luther King, Sojourner Truth, Jesse Owens and a number of other very well-known people. So why would my face be with theirs?\"\n\nThen, Lee-Payne looked it up online.\n\nBeing at that march, I guess I was kind of glad to be standing with people that wanted to make things right.\n\n\"So I immediately went to my computer, pulled it up, and lo and behold, there was this calendar image of the front and back cover of the calendar with my face on it.\"\n\nLee-Payne still has the black and white banner she's holding in the picture. In the top left corner it says, \"I was there.\"\n\nAn \"Enlightening\" Experience\n\nThe famous photo provides eternal proof that she was indeed at the March on Washington. The picture now lives at the National Archives. Lee-Payne has her own copy, personally signed by the photographer. Even without that photographic testament, the day is seared into her memory.\n\n\"It was important for my mother to be there,\" Lee-Payne says. \"And being her one and only child, it was important for me to be there with her.\"\n\nLee-Payne's family arrived at the National Mall early on Aug. 28. Her namesake, her Aunt Edith, was volunteering at the Red Cross tent and had to check in well ahead of the crowds, which helps explain why she had such a choice spot toward the front.\n\nLee-Payne's mother had once worked as an entertainer and knew a lot of people in show business. She was a dancer who opened for Cab Calloway, and she sometimes baby-sat for Sammy Davis Jr. when he was just a child star. Lee-Payne and her mother's vantage point near the entry to the stage allowed her mom to catch up with old friends, Lee-Payne says.\n\n\"Lena Horne came over where we were standing to talk to my mother, and in listening to them [it] was my first experience in learning some of the things that my mother had been subjected to,\" Lee-Payne recalls. \"Having to enter hotels through the back door, in things that they saw, in driving in a bus or on a train going from one state or city to the other. Those were things that my mother had never shared with me.\"\n\nShe had talked about being an entertainer, Lee-Payne says, but not about the hardship of being a black entertainer. Horne and Lee-Payne's mother didn't talk for a very long time, Lee-Payne says, \"but they talked about the purpose for being there and what it meant to them, so in sharing those things, it was enlightening to me.\"\n\nWhen Lee-Payne heard King talk about his dream for America, she indeed felt that her life embodied some of what he envisioned.\n\n\"I already lived that. I was able to go to integrated schools. When I was 5, 6, 7 years old, my next-door neighbors were white. Whenever we got on the bus, there was never any issue about where we sat,\" Lee-Payne says. \"We would frequently eat out and sit at lunch counters served by black and white waitresses. There were never any incidents. Being at that march, I guess I was kind of glad to be standing with people that wanted to make things right.\"\n\nLooking For Leadership To \"Move Us Forward\"\n\nBut as Lee-Payne moved into adulthood, she says, that dream felt like it started to disintegrate. She did well in school and studied business administration. But, she says, when she went searching for work as a secretary, the content of her resume was overshadowed by the color of her skin.\n\n\"I was denied employment at least 50 times, only \u2014 only \u2014 because I was black. As soon as I'd walk through the door, and the employer would see me, I would be told that the job had already been filled, or I probably wouldn't like the job anyway, or they need to reschedule something,\" Lee-Payne says. \"And it was just obvious in the few people that I could see in the office. ... And I never saw African-American women in those positions.\"\n\nLee-Payne eventually found work at Eastman Kodak. Over the years she has also worked as a civic activist, mainly in Detroit.\n\nThe exasperation captured in that photo of a young Edith Lee-Payne, then Edith Lee, still hovers over her heart \u2014 made clear when asked to share her thoughts on race relations in America today. Her six words for The Race Card Project: \"Marches, jobs, freedom and justice? Not.\"\n\n\"Instead of seeing the equality and the justice and the freedom and jobs that we should really have 50 years later, it's not there in a lot of places \u2014 I can't say everywhere,\" Lee-Payne says. \"What we don't have now that we had then, is the kind of leadership to kind of bring it together, to kind of help move us forward.\"\n\nLee-Payne is still working toward change. Her to-do list is still long, so this Aug. 28, she will once again spend her birthday in Washington at the Lincoln Memorial. \"There's no place that I could be, other than there,\" she says. \"It's too personal for me.\"", "keywords": ["race", "crowd", "king", "face", "black", "picture", "white", "things", "leepayne", "poster", "kind", "washington", "mother", "child", "1963"], "polarity": 0.11719682539682533, "subjectivity": 0.45955238095238077},

We've been trying to help some of you connect with people you've been trying to find.\n\nIn the 1970s, two little girls met at an elementary school in Miami, Fla., and became close friends. One was black, and one was white.\n\nDr. Sharony Green is now an assistant professor of history at the University of Alabama, and she said her friend Beth helped her during a tough time.\n\n\"I was among a group of African-American students who were integrating Biscayne Gardens Elementary in Miami in the early '70s. And everyone, generally speaking, was very kind to us. But something about my relationship with Beth was pretty special.\"\n\nGreen says that she has vivid memories of arriving at Biscayne Gardens on the school bus, where she would often find Beth waiting on the sidewalk for her.\n\n\"And she would hold my hand and we would go play together before the first bell rang,\" she says.\n\nBut overtime, the two girls grew apart. They found other friends and began to spend less and less time together. And race might have played a part in that, Green says.\n\n\"I think by our preteen years, you sort of have this unspoken expectation that maybe you should be more with your own kind,\" she says. \"So, I remember dancing to sort of prove to some of my black friends that I wasn't\u2014they used to sometimes call me 'white girl.' And that was pretty hurtful.\"\n\nBut Green never forgot her childhood friend.\n\n\"As a professor at the University of Alabama, and as a history professor in particular, I have a lot of opportunities to talk to my students about how much has changed and how there's still room for growth as we progress socially in America ... And from time to time when I lecture, I tell my students, you know, when I was a lot younger than you are, I had a friend named Beth, and she didn't look like me, and boy did I love her,\" Green says.\n\nNPR looked for Green's friend via social media, and found that the two women weren't very far from one another at all. And, they are both a part of the academic community.\n\nDr. Beth Hegab is a senior lecturer in industrial engineering at Louisiana Tech University.

I always hoped that I passed on that people are people and you look at them and look in their hearts and which ones you are going to be friends with based on that.\"\n\nHegab says she remembers running into Green once at a department store makeup counter where Green worked when the two women were just 18 years old.\n\n\"You recognized me and we talked for a little while. And that's the last time I ever remember seeing you,\" she says.\n\nFor Hegab, the reunion is a happy but bittersweet one.

William Lewis Moore decided to walk along Highway 11 from Chattanooga, Tenn., to Jackson, Miss., hoping to hand-deliver his letter to Gov. Ross Barnett. Moore wanted Barnett to fundamentally change Mississippi's racial hierarchy \u2014 something unthinkable for a Southern politician at the time.\n\nIn his letter, Moore warned the governor, \"Do not go down in infamy as one who fought the democracy for all which you have not the power to prevent.\" It never reached its destination. Moore was shot on the roadside, a killer never charged.\n\nThrough time, Moore's story has been overshadowed by more emblematic moments that gripped the nation that year, like the assassination of civil rights leader Medgar Evers in Jackson, Miss., in May and the deaths of four black girls in the September bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala. But while Moore's walk for equality is less well-known, it's an important chapter in the civil rights movement for many.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Ellen Johnson Courtesy of Ellen Johnson\n\nA Wagon, A Shopping Cart And A Stack Of Letters\n\nWilliam Moore was born in Binghamton, N.Y., but he was not just another \"Yankee\" sticking his nose where many Southerners believed it didn't belong. Moore had roots in the South. Moore was raised in Russell, Miss., after going to live with his grandparents at the age of 2. As an adult, Moore returned to Binghamton and began organizing demonstrations for civil rights. He also became a member of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), a vital arm of activism at the time.\n\nIf you drove down Highway 11 five decades ago, you might have spotted a middle-aged white man in rumpled clothes and coiffed hair, sporting a gap-toothed grin. You might have thought little of it and kept driving. But when you glanced back, you would have wondered why this guy was pulling a little red wagon, handing letters to people he passed and pushing a grocery cart plastered with a \"Wanted\" poster featuring an image of Jesus. William Moore definitely stuck out.\n\nBut there were people along his route who did more than wonder about strangers like William Moore. Mary Stanton, author of Freedom Walk, a book about Moore and others who continued his effort after his death, describes people who confronted him. The polite individuals interrogated him about his intentions; the rude threatened him.\n\nUltimately, Moore was shot twice in the head at point-blank range near Attalla, Ala. He was left on the side of the road at a picnic area approximately 300 miles short of Jackson. In her book, Stanton describes a frightened Willis Elrod, who stumbled over Moore's body when he pulled over to use the restroom.\n\nFloyd Simpson, a Ku Klux Klan member, was suspected of committing the murder but was never charged.\n\nToday, the patch of dirt at that spot along Highway 11 is now only meaningful to those already aware of Moore's story; the stone picnic tables have long since been removed. Before April 23, 1963, they provided rest for travelers. Afterwards, they symbolized America's troubled past.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Ellen Johnson Courtesy of Ellen Johnson\n\nBut for some, that spot in Alabama inspired action. Decades after Moore's death, Ellen Johnson of Stanhope, N.J., decided the postman's story could not end at that picnic area. In 2008 she and her friend Ken Loukinen set out to finish what Moore started.\n\nDecades Later, Another Attempt\n\nJohnson first learned about Moore's story while watching a film of Madalyn Murray O'Hair, an atheist activist, speaking to a group of law students. It's believed that Moore was an atheist and friend of O'Hair, and that she helped make some of the signs he carried on his walk.\n\nOnce Johnson, also an atheist, learned that Moore was killed for his beliefs, she was determined to find and deliver his letter. Johnson located Moore's widow and obtained mimeographed copies that Moore was distributing on his march.\n\nOn the 45th anniversary of Moore's death, with copies of his letter in-hand, Johnson, Loukinen and several others started their journey from the spot where Moore's body was found. Johnson says that she noted at the time that not much of Alabama seemed changed since 1963.\n\n\"There were some places, mostly Alabama, before we left Alabama, that looked like they hadn't changed in 45 years,\" Johnson says. \"Because it looked like I was seeing what Bill Moore saw.\"\n\nBut unlike Moore's journey 50 years ago, Johnson's walk to Jackson in 2008 garnered mild reactions.\n\n\"I think they just wanted to know that we were OK and they moved on,\" Johnson says of travelers who passed them on the road. \"Most people, eh, it was kind of ho-hum.\"\n\nFor Johnson, completing this march was anything but \"ho-hum.\" Johnson says that honoring Moore and others was her ultimate goal. When the marchers arrived at Gov. Haley Barbour's office in 2008, he would not take time to accept the letter. Even so, there was a great sense of accomplishment among the marchers.\n\nMoore's letter still remains undelivered, but Johnson takes pride in completing the postman's walk to Jackson.

In Meg and Shuri, we have two outspoken black girls. This, in itself is a dramatic change for the company: in the past, Disney has rarely celebrated black girls for being smart or self-assured.\n\nShuri invents the gadgets that her brother T'Challa (aka Black Panther) uses to save the people of Wakanda. Think about it: how would the Black Panther repel all the blows he's dealt without the outfit Shuri created?\n\nThen there's Meg Murray. She's the empathetic, brilliant child of scientists. She is unwavering in her faith that her missing father will return to her one day, even though her strengths \u2014 and struggles \u2014 aren't appreciated by anyone outside of her family.\n\nThese characters, and their storylines, seem distinctly different from the female protagonists that preceded them in Disney movies. But for Disney, reimagining what it means to be a female hero is nothing new.\n\nAfter decades of being accused of reinforcing racist and sexist stereotypes, Disney attempted to reframe the princess/girl-hero archetype with films like Pocahontas, Mulan and The Princess and the Frog. These films all featured young women of color. It's true that the girl heroes were strong, but their achievements often felt secondary to their romantic relationships.\n\nAdd to that, the way they were portrayed was often problematic: Viewers who were excited to see Disney's first black princess were dismayed when they realized that Tiana spent most of the movie as a frog. And for folks who know anything about colonial history, Pocahontas was a disappointment, too. The real life Pocahontas didn't fall in love with an English sailor \u2014 as a child, she was in fact forced to marry a white colonizer old enough to be her father.\n\nSince then, Disney has made some progress in depicting strong, dynamic people of color. In 2016's Moana, the titular character's love for her people and her culture is the key to saving her island. And (though its protagonist wasn't a girl,) 2017's Coco was widely lauded for portraying Mexican culture in a thoughtful, beautiful way.\n\nWhich brings us to today's Disney heroines: Meg Murray and Shuri. They're compelling young women of color whose stories don't need to be bolstered by romantic love or sanitized history.\n\nBut what made Disney take such the leap to, once again, re-imagine its girl-hero?\n\nUCLA professor and co-author of the annual Hollywood Diversity Report, Dr. Ana-Christina Ram\u00f3n says the business conditions were right. While Disney might be aware of the social implications of the movies it makes, she says it's also aware of what's \"going to improve the bottom line.\"\n\nThe most recent figures from the Motion Picture Association of America show that Latinos account for 23 percent of frequent movie-goers, while African-Americans and Asians represent a combined 26 percent of frequent movie-goers. So bringing Meg and Shuri to the big screen made business sense.\n\nRam\u00f3n added that Disney saw these box office trends play out in two ways. The live action reboots of Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast \u2014 in which both traditional Disney princesses were made more independent \u2014 were the 9th highest grossing film of 2015 and the second highest grossing film of 2017, respectively.\n\nAnd when it came to racial diversity, Disney, the parent company of Marvel Films, took the hint from the success of its superhero movies. According to Ram\u00f3n, \"the comic book franchise [had] been established already, so [Disney could] slowly bring in diversity with secondary characters throughout these stories... [They introduced] Falcon, [an African-American character] played by Anthony Mackie \u2014 he's the sidekick to Captain America. So they introduced a little diversity, but they [didn't] make it the main plotline.\"\n\nRam\u00f3n says there is still work to be done before girl-heroes of color who aren't black become the norm. That's because Hollywood executives still tend to think of diversity in black and white. \"When they think about Asian and Latino audiences, they tend to think of immigrant audiences, or they're not what they consider mainstream,\" she says.\n\nBut Ram\u00f3n says that the success of movies like Marvel's Black Panther and A Wrinkle in Time underscores what the research from the Hollywood Diversity Report has proved time and again: people \u2013 regardless of their race \u2014 want to see more racial diversity on the screen.", "keywords": ["panther", "heroine", "think", "diversity", "disney", "black", "movies", "ram\u00f3n", "color", "shuri", "imagining", "meg"], "polarity": 0.0872007108118219, "subjectivity": 0.3878106461439796},

The teens were itching to get to Washington for the march, but they couldn't afford the trip, so decided to hitchhike.\n\nBut first, Robert Avery had to convince his mother. It wasn't that hard, he recalls. \"I said, 'We're getting ready to go to Washington. We're going to be hitchhiking. I need a change of clothes, and whatever money you might have.' And she said, 'OK, just be careful.'\n\n\"I had been very active in the movement all summer,\" Avery says, \"so I think she trusted my judgment.\"\n\nRobert Avery was 15 years old when he hitchhiked from Gadsden, Ala., to Washington D.C. He was interviewed by several news organizations about his trip and is seen briefly in The March, a documentary film made by filmmaker James Blue for the United States Information Agency.\n\nDangerous Roads\n\nEven so, she may have prayed hard for her son's safety. In those days, the roads around Gadsden were perilous for anyone who openly supported ending segregation. Just a few months earlier, in April, William Moore, a white Baltimore mailman on a pilgrimage from Chattanooga, Tenn., to Jackson, Miss., was killed seven miles from Avery's home, on the same highway he and his friends would now travel.\n\nBefore his death, Moore had taken up a one-man stand against segregation and was making the long journey on foot to personally deliver a letter to Mississippi Gov. Ross Barnett. He was shot along the side of the road in an area called Noccalula Falls. Though Ku Klux Klan involvement was suspected, the case was never solved.\n\nAvery and his friends, Robert Frank Thomas and James Foster Smith, were plenty nervous as they approached the spot where Moore's body was found.\n\nThat's when Thomas said, \"Look guys, we know where we are. Here's this man who gave his life for us. This should encourage us to go on,\" Avery remembers.\n\nThen, the teens \"stopped at that spot, had a prayer, and as I can remember, never thought about turning around, never got tired, never had any doubt in my mind that we weren't going to make it to Washington from that point on,\" Avery says.\n\nIn the wee hours of the morning the boys got their first ride from a Greyhound Bus driver. \"Do you know where you are? Get on this bus!\" he told them. \"And he picked us up and took us to Chattanooga, Tenn.,\" because he knew the danger that we were getting ready to walk into,\" Avery says.\n\nThe bus driver didn't charge the young men for the ride \u2014 a good thing, because they had only a combined $10 among them. They slept in bus terminals and ate sparingly from vending machines. They also walked quite a bit, sometimes more than 30 miles at a stretch.\n\nThey also got rides from all kinds of people. Despite the strong segregation in the South, almost all of the motorists who picked up the three black teens were white. Avery says he never felt uneasy about the rides, with one exception.\n\nWhen Robert Avery hitchhiked to Washington D.C., he and his two traveling companions arrived a week before the demonstration. They made a pay phone call to civil rights activist and D.C. delegate Walter Fauntroy, who helped get them a place to stay at a local YMCA. The three teens were soon put to work, making picket signs for the rally in the organizing office for the March on Washington for $3 a day. Several days before the march and speeches, Avery and his friends met the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. \u2014 who had come looking for them at their parents' request. Robert Avery Describes Meeting Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n\"One guy picked us up, and it was a pickup truck, and we had a sign of course saying 'Washington or [Bust]' so everybody knew where we were going. And, he said, \"You boys know it's dangerous out here?' ... And he said, \"Y'all need to be careful.'\n\n\"And just the way he said it kind of raised the hair on the back of your neck. But, I mean, he was an OK guy ... [But] had he said that prior to [getting in] I don't think I would have got in the truck.\"\n\n'Not Far, Long Way To Go'\n\nAs they got closer to D.C. and crossed over from Tennessee into Virginia, their last ride came from a black family; a husband, wife and son.\n\n\"I wish now that we would have talked more to them, because it was at night and we probably slept a lot,\" Avery says. \"They were coming from Lynchburg. They lived in D.C. ... and they were going home. And as I look back again, I know they were God-sent.\"\n\nThat's because, as the group drove through the mountains, they saw black effigies hanging outside service stations. \"You know, the dummies that they hang out, the Rebel flags ... hanging from light posts and whatever,\" Avery recalls. \"That wasn't sending a signal, that was sending a strong message ... So they went to a lot of care to make them to make sure that people understood you can't stop here and buy gas.\"\n\nAvery says that harrowing journey was worth every step. The three friends made it to Washington a week before the scheduled march. They found a place to stay and lucked into a job making signs for the event. The boys even personally met Martin Luther King Jr. while working in the organizing office.\n\nToday, Avery is still an activist and a lawmaker. He's chairman of the finance committee on the Gadsden City Council. He's traveled some distance in life's journey, but when asked to share his six words about the progress made since the March on Washington, he offers, \"Not far, long way to go.\"", "keywords": ["teens", "reach", "martin", "king", "know", "luther", "avery", "determined", "feet", "friends", "used", "robert", "washington", "dc", "teen", "thumb", "1963"], "polarity": 0.07136263736263737, "subjectivity": 0.42337667887667885},

Martin Luther King Jr., delivered his iconic \"I Have A Dream Speech\" on Aug. 28, 1963. Approximately 250,000 people descended on the nation's capitol from all over the country for the mass demonstration.\n\nThrough The Race Card Project's six-word stories, we'll meet some of the people who witnessed that history and hear their memories and reflections on race relations in America today.\n\nThroughout 1963, American TV screens had been filled with images of non-violent demonstrations that turned ugly, with Southern police officers unleashing dogs and fire hoses on protesters. There were broad concerns all the way up to the top levels of government about the March on Washington. How large would the crowd be? Might there be violence?\n\nBut Jack Hansan of Cincinnati was not concerned about all that. A white man who'd been working on civil rights in Ohio, he wanted to be in that number, however large or small the gathering.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Jack Hansan Courtesy of Jack Hansan\n\n\"We had to get rid of this \u2014 I don't know how you would say it \u2014 this discrimination that was so prevalent in communities like our education system, our churches,\" Hansan says. \"So participating in the march was like climbing a mountain, and for us, we wanted to be on the top.\"\n\nThat did not sit well with Jack Hansan's father. He wrote a letter pleading for his son to stay put.\n\n\"He lived in Kansas City, Mo., and his message was, 'I wish you wouldn't go,' \" Hansan explains. \"And he said, 'Your real responsibility is to your family, your sons.' But you know, that was him.\"\n\nHansan was one of 500 Cincinnati businessmen and civic activists who took a special train to D.C., leaving Cincinnati at 5 p.m. \"We rode two nights on a train, one up and one back. There was no club car, but it was fun,\" he laughs. The group spent the night talking and schmoozing. \"We were all dressed politely, like we were going to an office \u2014 shirts and ties.\"\n\nThat attire was no accident. Marchers were advised by the local organizing committee to look clean and sharp, dressed as if they were in D.C. to close a deal.\n\nOnce they got to the city, Hansan says he had never seen a crowd that large and integrated. \"I do remember the songs and listening to the entertainers ... I remember Peter, Paul And Mary,\" he laughs. \"I remember the songs more than I do the speeches.\"\n\nEven so, Hansan knew he was witnessing history that day and wanted to tell his wife and four young sons about it. He grabbed a plain postcard, stamped with a Lincoln 4-cent stamp, and jotted down a few words. Hansan, who still has the postcard, chokes up as he reads his note aloud.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Jack Hansan Courtesy of Jack Hansan\n\nAs Hansan reads, his wife, Ethel, looks on and weeps. Her husband's trip \u2014 and the uncertainty over what might happen at the march \u2014 was very stressful, she says. \"Just listening to him talk about it, it did bring me to tears remembering back on what it felt to be left back with the little ones and not really knowing what was happening there.\n\n\"Fortunately, we did have a television set and they were broadcasting it, so I was kind of living it vicariously,\" she continues. \"But the little kids were ignored and not properly taken care of most of the day, because I sat in front of the television watching it with a great deal of trepidation.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Jack Hansan Courtesy of Jack Hansan\n\nRev. King's speech was very moving, Ethel Hansan says. And even today, she cries when she hears the song, \"We Shall Overcome.\" \"That was very moving for me, when they were all holding hands, and they were singing.\"\n\nEthel and Jack Hansan, who now live in Northern Virginia, are proud of their memories. He's Catholic and she's Jewish, and the pair has spent a lifetime working on building bridges of all kinds. They've kept a treasure trove of mementos from the march.\n\nWhen asked to share their own six-word stories on race relations in America today, Jack Hansan says, \"We all need to keep trying.\"\n\n\"That's it,\" he says. \"You know, it's not been done. And the March on Washington was just one of the starting events, but it's still not complete.\"\n\nEthel had a harder time settling on just six words. \"But what I would like to impart to people who are persecuted is to rise above it,\" she says. \"You know, don't let it drag you down.\n\n\"Because I think that's the tendency, when you have all that negative stuff thrown at you, that you tend to believe it,\" she says. \"Don't believe it. You're better than that ... You're better than that and you know it. You should know it.\"\n\nYou can find more of Jack Hansan's memories and mementos from the March on Washington at The Social Welfare History Project, a website he founded to educate the public about the history of social welfare in America.", "keywords": ["image", "race", "caption", "toggle", "courtesy", "63", "mountain", "jack", "hansan", "history", "join", "washington", "know", "climbing"], "polarity": 0.11486557613606796, "subjectivity": 0.3454983086130628},

Every so often NPR Host/Special Correspondent Michele Norris will dip into those six-word stories to explore issues surrounding race and cultural identity for Morning Edition. You can find hundreds of six-word submissions and submit your own at www.theracecardproject.com.\n\nAmericans adopt thousands of children each year. And as the nation has become increasingly diverse, and with the growth of international adoption in recent decades, many of those children don't look like their adoptive parents. That intersection of race and adoption has prompted many people to submit their six words to The Race Card Project, including this submission from a Louisiana woman: \"Black babies cost less to adopt.\"\n\nOther contributors have also addressed the skin-color based fee structure for many adoptions, including Caryn Lantz of Minneapolis. Her six words: \"Navigating world as transracial adopted family.\"\n\nLantz and her husband, both white, are the adoptive parents of two African-American boys. The couple had struggled for years to conceive a child. When they finally decided to turn to adoption they were willing to adopt kids of another race. But they were concerned by what they discovered about the differential costs.\n\nLantz says she remembers a phone call with an adoption agency social worker. \"And [she] was telling us about these different fee structures that they had based on the ethnic background of the child. And ... they also had, sort of a different track for adoptive parents.\"\n\nMoving through the process would be quicker if the family was open to adopting an African-American (not biracial) child, the social worker explained to her. \"And that is because they have children of color waiting,\" Lantz says. Adopting biracial, Latino, Asian or Caucasian children could be a slower process, she was told, because there were more parents waiting for them.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Caryn Lantz Courtesy of Caryn Lantz\n\n\"And I remember hearing this and just sort of being dumbfounded that they would sort of segregate \u2014 to use a loaded term \u2014 segregate these children by ethnic background before they were even in this world,\" Lantz says. \"That's when I started realizing that, OK, being a parent to a child of a different ethnic background \u2014 this is gonna be some work. There's going to be a lot of work on our end in order to be successful parents and to get our child ready for this world.\"\n\nThe Race Card Project spoke with social workers, adoption agencies and adoptive parents about adoption costs based on ethnicity. We discovered that this is not widely talked about, but it is common, Norris tells NPR's David Greene. \"No one is comfortable about this.\"\n\nNon-white children, and black children, in particular, are harder to place in adoptive homes, Norris says. So the cost is adjusted to provide an incentive for families that might otherwise be locked out of adoption due to cost, as well as \"for families who really have to, maybe have a little bit of prodding to think about adopting across racial lines.\"\n\nIn other words, Norris explains, there are often altruistic reasons for the discrepancy \u2014 \"but people who work in adoption say there's one more reason, quite simply: It's supply and demand.\"\n\nThe fees typically cover administrative costs, but also costs associated with taking care of the mother, like travel, rent, health care and counseling services. Now, some states and agencies are using a different formula to make adoption more affordable for families, with a sliding scale based on income rather than skin color. In that system, lower-income families pay less to adopt. Some agencies are also moving toward a uniform cost system where all adoptive parents would pay the same fees.\n\nUltimately, the Lantz family adopted their sons from Nevada, where the sliding scale was based on income, not race. But because they were eager to find a child, they did consider agencies that used a race-based cost differential.\n\nDuring the process, the family received four calls about potential children to be matched with them \u2014 three from states that used this race-based cost structure. \"One was a full African-American child, one was a biracial child and one was a white child,\" Lantz says. \"And when they told me the fees for the white child, I was in a Babies R Us [store] and I remember having to sit down in the aisle and say to myself, 'I don't think we can afford to adopt this child if the expectant mother chose us.' \"\n\nThe cost to adopt the Caucasian child was approximately $35,000, plus some legal expenses. \"Versus when we got the first phone call about a little girl, a full African-American girl, it was about $18,000,\" Lantz says. The cost for adoption of a biracial child was between $24,000 and $26,000.\n\nEyes do linger on her blended family in her community, Lantz says, and curious people make comments. Two years ago, before she had a second son, she started growing concerned about the effect those comments might have on her son as he grows older.\n\n\"I am a little nervous about what we're gonna do when he starts to understand why someone approached us at Target and thanked us for saving babies,\" she explained at the time. \"Or when a woman, you know, walks down the aisle of the grocery store and says, 'What's he mixed with?' \"\n\nLantz responded to that incident, she recalls, by saying, \"My son, we adopted him at birth. And, you know, his ethnic background is a little different. And we don't know a whole bunch about it, but he is a beautiful kid, isn't he?\"\n\n'White Parents Raise Beautifully Diverse Children'\n\nThat six-word submission to The Race Card Project comes from Louise Bannon of Holly Springs, N.C. Bannon and her husband Greg, both white, have two sons: Darius, Bannon's biological son, who is biracial, and Bryce, who is adopted and African-American.
